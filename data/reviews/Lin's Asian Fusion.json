{"text":"They keep getting my delivery order wrong. I have tried the Eat Street app, ordered directly off their site and have called them and they still forget something. Done going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I haven't had anything I didn't like here and the prices are reasonable. And they use asparagus in their vegetable mix which is a pleasant surprise!   Unfortunately, my last meal consisted of about half green pepper and onion. I ordered a basil vegetable dish for takeout hat was mostly tasty, except for the pepper and onion ratio."}
{"text":"The Lo Mein was very delicious as well as the Egg rolls.  Wish they had pork egg rolls but not that big of a deal.  The problem comes with the General Tsos.  The chicken was cut so small the breading was more than the chicken served.  A cheap gimmick that has definitely made me not return for good."}
{"text":"Poor service even when they were not busy the night my wife and I had dinner.  The food was bland for \"Asian\" cuisine.  It seems the South Side will always have subpar \"Asian\" restaurants whether it be sushi, thai, chinese."}
{"text":"Have eaten at Lin's several times and I would recommend it. Prices are reasonable and the menu has a nice variety of choices. I never had any problems with the service the times I have eaten there."}
{"text":"August 29 my coworkers and I ordered, first they sent me the wrong food, second I had a hair in my food! I used to always love Lins but not anymore. Hint...maybe wear a hair net and hair pulled back."}
{"text":"A dozen of my coworkers and I used to get this place takeout almost every Saturday, and half of us would get the same thing every time: coconut chicken. I like this coconut sauce so much, I don't think I'll ever get enough of it.  I decided on 4 stars instead of 5 since I literally have had just one dish about 30 times..."}
{"text":"I went to Lin's today for about the 8th time.  I've ordered something different every time (always vegetarian), and every time I've been really happy with, and sometimes blown away by, the food.  Lunch portions are great, with lots of fresh veggies.   I really didn't want to like this place more than Thai Me Up which is right across the street, but I have to say--this is the best Asian food in the Southside."}
{"text":"If I could give Lin's 3.5 stars I would.  While I have never had a bad meal here, I have never been blown away either.  I guess as far as Americanized Chinese food (not seeing the \"fusion\" here) goes I think middle part of the bell curve is quite large for me.  That being said, this seems to be my go-to spot when ordering Chinese food in the South Side.  I have had the beef noodle soup, General Tso's tofu, sesame chicken, spring rolls, egg rolls, and the pad-thai.  All were pretty solid.  I have not visited since they put in the new bar addition; I hope this doesn't affect its status as a BYOB restaurant.  Pros: -Speedy Takeout -BYOB -Clean Dining Room and Bathroom"}
{"text":"The food is good. However, my work is 1.9 miles away and my coworkers had ordered delivery from there before, but when I called today to put a hefty delivery order for the whole company, they wouldn't deliver to us. We're right over hot metal bridge, literally a stone's throw away, and not at rush hour either, but no dice. So no lin's for me anymore."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place.  I go here pretty frequently and enjoy everything I've tried. I have received the wrong thing once or twice, though. I recommend the general tso's tofu.   I kind of get the sense that this is mostly a take-out restaurant that also partially does dine-in.  The servers are always pleasant, though.                 Also as a nitpick, I've been with two different people now who have asked whether some sushi combos included nigiri or not, and both times (I think with different servers) the server says something to the effect of \"Uh.....it's sushi.\" I'm not trying to make fun, but if you work at a restaurant that serves sushi, it'd be good to know the different kinds, no?"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here to celebrate our anniversary. I had the coconut chicken. It was unbelievable. Lightly fried chicken in a creamy coconut sauce with broccoli and white rice. We ordered the avocado spring roll, and I found that a bit odd. Tasted more like a crab rangoon. I did not taste or see any avocado. My husband had the Szechuan shrimp with the honey chicken. He enjoyed the shrimp very much. Bit into a hot pepper and had to leave the table! Our waiter was very attentive and sweet, and I enjoyed the ambiance and decor. It was fun looking onto Carson Street while eating. My only con is the $3 per person corkage fee. Fees at byobs really annoy me."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, but their portions are a bit lacking. I feel like I need to buy a sandwich after I eat here.  Staff has always been very nice and patient."}
{"text":"This is quite frankly the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten in Pittsburgh. It's such a shame because there aren't a ton of Asian take out places in southside, but you're definitely better off going somewhere else for it, like Oakland.   I have gotten a few meals, hoping I would find one that I like. I tried the orange chicken and it was so over-fried that you couldn't even taste the chicken. My boyfriend has disliked all of his meals as well. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"horrible service and food.  i placed a delivery order and was told it would take 30 minutes.  it took almost 2 HOURS to get my food!!  ridiculous.  what if i wasn't going to work that late and i had paid for it already?  when i called to see where my food was, i got a litany of excuses about them being backed up, lost driver (delivery was going downtown - not complicated), etc., etc.  uuuh, not my problem.  you're running the business, remember?  you're supposed to do what it takes to deliver on all levels - e.g. hire more staff, get knowledgeable drivers, get a GPS.  i pay you to make and bring the food in the time stated, period.  if they were a little late, no problem, but 2 hours is UNACCEPTABLE!  of course, by the time i got the food, it wasn't hot, wasn't good, and certainly wasn't worth all the trouble.  when i made a big stink about it, they offered me a deal the NEXT time i ordered.  yeah, as if i'm going to go there again."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite restaurant. I've never had a bad experience at Lin's.  My favorite dish is the mandarin tofu. It's consistently good. If they delivered to Baldwin, I'd definitely be eating their food more often."}
{"text":"First time here and had the excellent Kung Pao and Tso's combination with an egg roll and fried rice. Other reviews mentioned small portions and poor service but I didn't encounter either of those today. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really great lunch special: 2 (basic) rolls for $8  Fairly good crab Rangoons - they weren't all breading, which is the worst.  Great service, and simple decor.  Recommend if you're in the area and want some cheap decent sushi. I will have to come back and try one of their regular rolls."}
{"text":"Right now I'm very dissatisfied with this place! I placed a takeout order for General Tso's, Beef Lo Mein & Crab Rangoons. I ordered this at about 8:40pm, right before going in to wait. While waiting I noticed the place was practically empty and remembered the order said it'd take approximately 10-35 minutes. So I figured about 15 minutes at most. But no, it seems they screwed up and forgot about my order since a girl working there came up to me to ask my name and what I was waiting on. I didn't get my order until 9:45pm.  An hour?!? Seriously??? This is horrible! Now I'm waiting to see what my time and money got me once I'm home. Then I'll update this based on the food quality."}
{"text":"the money was really good. the food was heavenly and the price was pretty affordable"}
{"text":"Went here with my little girl on Sunday. Food was great. Ambience and service was average. Big complaint is the menus. They're all ripped up and in tatters. Plus the tables could have been a little cleaner.  We got Egg-fried rice and dumplings. The Egg-fried rice was a large serving for the price. The dumplings were average. We also got three different sushi rolls. The sushi was decent but, as usual for Yinzburgh, the rice wasn't made properly.  Sushi is vinegared rice. Very few places here in Yinzburgh make it correctly. Still, the contents of the sushi was good. My daughter and I were well-fed and the price wasn't terrible."}
{"text":"The walnut chicken is the most delicious in the region, maybe the world. My friends rave about the rice teas. And they're always friendly and speedy. Plenty of seating and a great atmosphere if you want to dine in."}
{"text":"The Cantonese Egg Noodles here are by far my favorite in the city. Honestly, I love everything I've ever ordered from here. I usually get delivery, but I have been inside the actual restaurant and it's really cute in there. Delivery almost always arrives much sooner than expected, they also give you silverwear (which is always exciting), the food always arrives super hot, and the delivery people are very nice. I only ever order via grubhub or foodler because I prefer to not speak to humans when I order food, so I can't say much for the friendliness of the people who answer the phones. All in all, I 100% recommend this place. Then teriyaki chicken is really good, but again... Cantonese Egg Noodles for the win."}
{"text":"Great takeout! It was decently priced and ready for us to pick up in a short amount of time. I absolutely loved my chicken fried rice!"}
{"text":"This is BY FAR the best fusion restaurant in Pittsburgh!!  Fresh sushi, great Chinese food, and the owner (Lam) is awesome to talk to and will share knowledge of the many fresh dishes on the menu!! I frequently visit for dinner or just to stop by for snacking and good conversation!"}
{"text":"I am thrilled to have this restaurant in walking distance to our business. Lin's just added a sushi bar and it is tops in my opinion. I have been back on three occasions in the past two weeks and I find it consistently delicious and fresh. The eel roll and tempura rolls are my favorite so far. Hope you do well with the new sushi bar."}
{"text":"Best place for American Asian food in Pittsburgh and yummy sushi too! Delivery is not always the same quantity and quality that you get when you sit down but always still never disappoints. They also have pretty good deals for lunch and a bar. Definitely worth a stop in!"}
{"text":"I used Yelp to find \"sushi near me\" and this location popped up.  There was a terrible odor (rotten smell) from the entrance of the location.  I ended up asking for my order to go, because the smell was so bad.  The service was very slow and the staff seemed to care more about socializing with each other than checking on the customers.  I can't imagine coming back with this same staff and service."}
{"text":"Another BYOB in Southside! WOO HOO!   I went here with a man friend and on a rainy saturday night.    The menu has a bit of a take out vibe, its even numbered like a take out menu. The menu is definitely more extensive than Thai Me Up right down the street.    The interior is pretty for such a causal place (perfect people watching windows out front). We both started off with soups Tofu Veggie for me and Egg Drop for him. My soup had big chunks of veggies and tofu in a tasty broth.  I order the Curry which was a yellow curry with shrimp and veggies. I thought it was strange that they only offered one kind of curry. The dish came with rice and the portion was huge! It was solid and spicy. Service was attentive but the place was dead!   PROS: Cheap, BYOB, nice interior, friendly staff, large menu with different protein options, large vegetarians options   CONS: The food was good but it didn't blow me away, the place was dead on a saturday night ( like 2 other tables), quiet   OVERALL: Might come back for a quick bite but its not going to be a \"Go-To\" for me. Although the BYOB is a huge plus!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the better Asian restaurants! They have an awesome menu. I love that you can order a bento meal and get 2 different entrees plus an egg roll and rice for under $10. The teriyaki chicken is my favorite! And they have excellent fried rice. Good service and they are quick. Pick up orders are ready in 15 minutes. Delivery is available. You can order and pay online which is convenient. They serve nice sized portions, but I wouldn't suggest splitting a meal because they're not large enough for 2 people unless you get an appetizer. Over, this is one of my top 3 favorite Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars - I would.  Beyond AWFUL customer service skills. My order was delivered without two items. When I called for a credit towards my meal that I couldn't eat bc it wasn't delivered with everything, they only wanted to credit me for what was missing, not the entire meal that I cannot eat now. Ridiculous, go get schooled on how to manage your mistakes, it's okay we are all human and make them, try to learn from them. Not sure how you will succeed without customer service skills? Never again. Waste of money. Here's to eating duck sauce for dinner."}
{"text":"great place for Chinese food.  excellent prices excellent food quality fast and free delivery.  its usually at my door in under 15 minutes piping hot."}
{"text":"Took my granddaughter here after an eye appointment after a friend kept talking about it and I had to give it a try.  Seriously the best general tso chicken we've ever had.  My baby grand said she was in Asian heaven.  The atmosphere was nice bathrooms and menus were clean and staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"What a fucking joke.i callec@ 5.? The cubt told me to hold tw8. She said that she was so. There is no way that they are buisi. Fucking no way."}
{"text":"Three words. Avocado Spring Rolls.   Lins is delicious oriental food with flair, while some menu items might look familiar it's not your typical Chinese takeout place.  I'm partial for the honey chicken dish and the General Tso's chicken.   The staff is always friendly and goes out of their way to make your experience enjoyable."}
{"text":"I used to eat at Lin's quite a bit a couple years ago and they were fantastic! I tried it yesterday for the first time in about two years and I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed. I ordered three different dinners for three different people, and all three of us were left looking at each other wishing we hadn't just blown the cash on such a dull meal. The portions were pretty small for the price they charged, and most importantly they were bland. All three meals were practically flavorless, slathered in syrupy sauces that coated your mouth and just made you feel like a terrible person.  Service also used to be great. The staff was friendly and helpful, but that wasn't what I experienced yesterday. People were unsmiling, lounging on counters and playing on phones. I felt like I was inconveniencing them by picking up my to-go order. Sadly, I won't be returning to Lin's."}
{"text":"I got them for takeout and it really was just mediocore. Very, very reasonable prices. I got beef fried rice, crab rangoons, wonton soup, and an egg roll all for $18. I wouldn't recommend the crab rangoons they were more onion than anything.  Everything else was good though! I will return for sure. Also, very nice and on point service. The to go person was very nice and on time, and they gave you more than you even need with condiments, silverware, and napkins. it was also all nicely delivered.   Good deals and good food!"}
{"text":"One thing I can say about Lin's is that the food is always fresh and delivery is always fast. If you are looking for greasy Chinese food, this is not your place. Lin's food is made to order and you can taste the care they put into preparing their dishes. I have never had a bad meal!"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable-size portions, and a nice setting.  Fun that sushi is also on offer, although I stuck with a traditional Chinese dish."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite and the food was delicious.  Crab rangoons cooked perfect and for $3.50- a good deal.  Then we got Chicken on a stick- 4 sticks for $4.50 was a great deal.  Then we ordered the eel cucumber roll for $6 was a good deal as well.  Food came out fast and our server was very friendly.  Great place to stop for a quick bite, we will be back."}
{"text":"Initially I didn't like the place. Since, it was so close to my workplace, I go there often. It is a nice place to a quiet lunch. The food is good, affordable. I don't know how authentic chinese it is, but it kinda caters to my taste buds."}
{"text":"I have been here before which is the reason why I decided to return. The food is consistent and the drinks are great. They have a wide variety of Chinese food."}
{"text":"This is good typical Asian food. They have different, and delicious, drinks which I want to keep going back to try more and more. I love the frozen/icey one! Its perfect for a hot summer day. The food always comes out so fast, like 10-15 minutes fast, and I have never been disappointed. Its fresh, healthy, and quick!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good Chinese place in Pittsburgh.  Lin's is one of those places.  They have a good variety of choices from Chinese to Thai/noodles to Sushi.  I have yet to be disappointed by the place.    I also have yet to leave the place with the MSG sweats.  The flavors are clean and while some of the sauces can be a bit sticky-sweet, it never is to the point where you don't know what you are eating or feel like you just had dessert instead of a meal.  My favorite thing on the menu has to be their Hot and Sour Soup.  It is definitely one of the best you will find in the area.  It is actually both spicy and sour with a hint of sesame in the background.  Not over spiced and not overpowered by vinegar.  It has a wonderfully full flavor and the bits of meat, tofu and mushrooms work wonderfully in it.  Their lunch special bento boxes are an awesome way to taste multiple main dishes on the cheap as you figure out what your favorites are.  Other great things are: All of their sushi - very fresh and very tasty Schezwan anything Pan-fried wonton with garlic sauce (SOOOO GOOOOOOD!!)  Go.  Order.  Enjoy.  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I am very glad I never ordered delivery from this place before I stopped in there this Sunday. Put these clues together: The menu was ragged and torn, then laminated over the tears and missing hunks of paper, then the lamination was peeling off  over half-way and the whole thing was sticky. The table tent signs were also covered in flecks and bits of food. The dining roon staff were inattentive and seemed inexperienced and a little awkward around adults. I ordered some tea and was perusing the menu for what might be safest food. It was pouring down rain and I was on foot without an umbrella and hungry. Call it serendipity that I stopped in. I went back to the restrooms and the air freshener smell in the ladies room was suspiciously strong - think about the air freshener scene from the movie Se7en. Well, it would be suspicious except you have to walk past the kitchen to get there and I couldn't even smell food cooking - only a strong smell of mold and a well-represented smell of sewage back-flow to go with it. It could have been the result of old architecture near the river in a low place with a downpour outside - not their fault, but not my problem either. I was actually embarrased for the proprietors, so I ordered a couple small things to go and tipped the waitress. Forunately, the order arrived as the rain was slowing. I left and tossed the food completely untouched in a trash can down by 18th Street."}
{"text":"Certainly affordable, edible food, but prepare for whatever you order to be some combination of average vegetables and average protein doused in a beige, salty sauce: no distinct flavors. Ordered the curry chicken and was surprised to find it, too, the same as the rest. Unappetizing plate of bell peppers and chicken in a thin sauce that tasted nothing like curry, no rice. Asian fusion = a wide variety of bland, boring food."}
{"text":"This is not my first rodeo at Lin's, but it is the first time my husband and I have been here with their sushi bar open. I started with Egg Flower soup, which is pretty standard as an egg drop soup goes but served very hot (keep the ice water close by!). He put in an order for a blue crab Philadelphia roll at the same time we ordered our entrees, white meat sesame chicken / broccoli and vegetable lo mein. The chicken is delicious and their lo mein is always spot on. The roll didn't come until after the entrees and he wasn't impressed. The roll was much too large and the presentation was sloppy. No soy sauce for dipping was brought to the table until requested and there was less than a pea sized dollop of wasabi. He said he would have sushi here again but they have a lot of work to do. Hopefully this service will improve with more experience. Overall, Lin's is a good choice for Chinese food but Nakama or Little Tokyo is preferential for sushi as of now."}
{"text":"MSG-ed, simplified Chinese-American fare. Menu is the very, very standard \"chinese takeout menu\" - so you absolutely know what to expect in terms of quality and type of food. If you are looking for very standard Chinese takeout, this is a go-to."}
{"text":"Usually they have alright food but they will never bring you everything you order ( from chop sticks to entire plates of food). It is priced alright to be fair but once it comes to paying for a mistake (either yours or theirs) you are the one paying... (btw there is no reason i shouldn't get alright service i order at least once a from them and drivers make at least 5 from me alone but i guess i gotta find a new chinese spot"}
{"text":"First, I have never been inside the restaurant itself I have only ordered online and gotten delivery.  That said Lin's has become my go-to for Chinese food when I want to be lazy and order in. The food is consistently good if not great, no matter the food selection. The crab rangoons and the coconut chicken have become my favorite meals but I've liked every thing I've happened to try. The portions are sizable and last a few meals. The delivery is always fast and prompt, at times well ahead of the scheduled time given. No complaints and I will continue to give my service in the future."}
{"text":"nice decor.  moderately priced.   food could be better.  order pan fried noodles, with noodles on the side (to keep them crispy) result - very little noodles provided and very oily.  and as a result half of the noodles were no longer crispy.  service could be better.  on a slow night. with the food not coming out all at the same time. some of the food was not hot."}
{"text":"I moved from the South Side to Columbus a few years ago. I still am mildly depressed to have left the option of calling Lin's and having them deliver my order so fast. Lin's was my go to for basic dishes such as fried rice as well as sushi to go. Lord, do I miss those egg rolls! Give them a try!"}
{"text":"I've been experimenting with tofu and it seems very few restaurants want to use it on their menu. I'm not a vegetarian, but one I was snuck some in a stir fry, I fell in love with it. Lin's prepares it perfectly, which isn't easy to do. My fiancé even preferred my tofu over his chicken.  The only bad thing about the restaurant is that they don't deliver, but if you just use grub hub, your fine.  If you haven't had good Chinese in a while, come here and enjoy."}
{"text":"Went into the restaurant on impulse, excited for some sushi.  We waited ten minutes while all the servers and staff crowded around the register making idle conversation and played with their phones.  No menus, drink orders or even acknowledged by the staff, so we got up and walked out.  No one even said anything, even though we walked right past the crowded counter to walk out the door.  Most of the customers looked pretty annoyed.  The place wasn't even half full.  Unacceptable."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great prices for delicious food. Check out their bento boxes. So far, it's the best Chinese I've had in Pittsburgh, by far. I go about 1-2 times a week and have no plans of slowing down. Looking forward to trying their sushi. Everyone I've brought here has loved it."}
{"text":"Last few times I've had it, it really wasn't very good. Skimpy portions and the sauces were too salty. The shrimp had a funny taste."}
{"text":"Love the food here the presentation is always great, it is always fresh, and the food is always fast! I love that the windows open, there is usually a nice breeze. I have taken my grandma here a few times she loves the General Tso's shrimp, its not on the menu but they make it by request. They are open until 10! Which i just found out and that is great news lol i ordered a drink, heard the blender, and for some reason said drink was sitting on the counter until it melted while the servers were talking, but I wasn't gonna be a b!tch i drank it and it was good. Needless to say it's a great little hidden gem that everyone just walks by. STOP in and try the General Tso's it's one of the best!   Now once you add Egg Foo Yung, you will get 5 stars! lol"}
{"text":"Hrm so I feel like when I have a craving for Chinese Food I want flavorful delicious Chinese. Unfortunately, Lins Asian Fusion is definitely not that. I ordered their Dinner Bento which is around $9 that comes with fried rice, beef and broccoli, and general tsos as well as some vegetable gyoza (pan fried)... I mean honestly how can you screw that up?   Well Lins did. The gyoza were burnt and the beef and broccoli/general tsos was bland. Apparently as far as the southside is concerned good Chinese might be a rarity.  I guess I'm done ordering Chinese from Lins I'll stick to china house in bloomfield."}
{"text":"So amazing. Explosions of tantalizing flavors for my taste palate......I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I have owed Lins a 5 star review for a long time... The General Tso and Sesame chicken are a staple in my diet... I loved next to Lins for a couple years yet it never got old!   The prices are amazing, it's BYOB but they have a bar it's the best Chinese food in SouthSide .... Hands down worth 2X What they charge.  Try the L9!!! Again Try the L9!!! Like don't even look at what it is just say one L9 Please."}
{"text":"I've decided to update my review because i've ventured here many times since my review a year ago. One thing i'd like to note, in my review last year i said that the egg rolls were small. Well, the spring rolls are small.. the chicken or shrimp egg roll is normal size. My go to here is the general tso's. It's good, but not very spicy.. more sweet. I've also tried to beef/mixed veggies and Szechuan chicken. I enjoyed both. A friend ordered sushi here and it was plated beautifully. Also, they have a cool mix of sushi.. even teriyaki chicken sushi for those who arent fans of seafood. They are BYOB. This is my new go to place for chinese. We've been satisfied every time."}
{"text":"The chicken we ordered was so hard, you couldn't stick it with a fork and my dish was totally not what I ordered. We ordered new dishes which were edible. But the point is, the owner wanted us to pay for all the meals, including the inedible one and the one that was incorrect.  After some negotiations, she said she would only take meal off, which still wasn't going to work.  After about 15 minutes, she finally agreed to only charge us for the food we ate.  I felt so bad for our waitress!!!  We will never be going there again!!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. Especially the general tso chicken. The food is much better in house. Tried it delivery and it was mediocre. I think if I had started out eating the delivery food I wouldnt have noticed. Everything is better fresh from the kitchen. I've chatted with the owner while waiting for take out for my wife. Pretty down to earth guy. I'm happy to see they are still doing business. Eat there maybe 2 every 2 months. Try not to wear it out. Hope everyone that likes Asian tries it out once."}
{"text":"The service and food tasted great. However. The all night being sick was not a fun time."}
{"text":"I really prefer to visit a place a few times before rendering a verdict, especially when the menu is varied, but I was so pleased to discover the pad thai at Lin's is pretty delicious that I have to let Yelp know right now.  I now work in the South Side, but far enough off Carson that most of the delicious restaurant offerings aren't within walking distance (given a half hour for lunch). I noticed Lin's as I drove in to work one day and decided I needed to give it a shot; this was only reinforced after a coworker went for lunch and deemed it Tasty.  So, on a payday, my craving for pad thai won, and I called in an order. I asked if they had bubble tea; it's not listed on the takeout menu, but they do, so I added a milk tea on to my order. I walked down and my order was ready when I got there -- perfect timing. I did have to wait for them to make the tea, but I understand that it doesn't make sense to prep an iced drink ahead of time and have it sitting there getting warm and watered down.  The pad thai was pretty darn good. It wasn't the best I've ever had, but I liked it more than I like, say, Lulu's. Which I also like! So that's a win. It's got that combination of hot and sour and sweet and salty that is what really makes me crave it, and the shrimp were plump and flavorful. I'd definitely have this again, and am in fact contemplating getting it today, now that I'm thinking about it.  The bubble tea was good, fairly standard bubble tea. Plenty of tapioca pearls, thankfully, and a good, strong black tea flavor. I couldn't find the bubble tea flavors listed while I was in the restaurant, either. I wish they'd make them more obvious.  All in all, it's no Thai Cuisine or Thai Suan Thip, but as a quick and reasonably priced takeout lunch at work, Lin's gets four stars from me."}
{"text":"I used to be a loyal customer. Not anymore.  I went in to order food to go, simple two meals. They give me the food, no problem, and me and my friend get in the car and get home, on Saturday night in the south side. We luckily found parking so no way we were leaving.  We get home and realize instead of one of our meals, we had an order of potstickers, not even close. So I call, and they tell us to bring the potstickers back to the restaurant in order to receive our food...are you kidding?? They were open for another hour, couldn't have driven it over and we could've exchanged it? They explained that no one else ordered potstickers so they don't know why we got them and that's why we had to bring them back...how is it our fault that the kitchen messed up?   Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"I was driving by when I saw their sign for Boba Tea -- I knew I had to go in.  My love affair with milk teas and tapioca pearls will never end.  Morgan hit the nail on the head when she said they have few flavors.  I was surprised to see that there are less than 15 flavors on their menu.  What made it worse is that they don't have almond.  How can any Asian place NOT have almond flavor?    I moved on and ordered the Taro milk tea with pearls.  For those that have never tasted Taro, it tastes quite a bit like pecan.  After I paid, I received my purple drink and ran out the door like a child with a new toy.  As I took my first sip, I was a bit shocked due to the sweetness.  Wow!  That was a lot of sugar.  My next trip, I ordered the honeydew at the suggestion of the associate behind the counter.  I told her that I wanted it less sweet.  She said she only put in a drop of the sugar compared to what they normally put in.  Amazing how the sugar can mask the flavor of the milk tea.  While I enjoyed the honeydew, it wasn't a flavor that I would crave.  On my third trip, I ordered the taro again and this time had them put in only a drop of sugar.  It was SO much better.  While I will never crave the taro, it will definitely help quell my need for milk teas.  Talking to the owner, I learned that the remaining flavors she carries are the flavors that actually sell in the area.  I wonder if she would order the almond or pineapple flavors for me if I paid for them?"}
{"text":"Spending a great deal of time in the Southside of Pittsburgh (still not sure if that's a good or a bad thing) I was really excited about Carson Street's new addition. The last time I had Asian food in the Southside it was at a shady place that looked more like a Laundromat than a restaurant and the food tasted a lot like gasoline. The interior of this place is beautiful. High ceilings, large windows in the front (both times I've been there they've been wide open and inviting in the fresh air), and a great color palette. I've heard though that on the weekends in the evening the open windows sometimes invite in not only fresh air, but also some solicitation from the roaming homeless and drunks either asking for money or doling out insults or sexual harassment to the restaurants customers.    I've been in twice now and both times I've chosen items off of the lunch/dinner menus as they were quick and clear in what was included. The staff was quick and friendly, I even had a chance to speak to the owner at length about future plans to better and expand his business. While it does have that slight air of a new business just getting off the ground, it's not at all reflected in the food options. I definitely recommend this as an option when you're looking for a break from the usual bar food found on Carson Street."}
{"text":"Best Ho Fun that I have had since leaving home, it was so flavorful and just perfect!!! Also the lunch specials are killer, 2 sides and fried rice for only $5.95!!! I really want to dine in at this restaurant as I have only had take-out so far!"}
{"text":"Nice new little place very friendly wait staff and my water was never empty. Good selection on the menu with reasonable prices.  I ordered the Seafood udon and everything in it seemed very fresh and the broth was light yet tasty. I will definitly come back to try a few more items."}
{"text":"I recently went to Lin's and the prices are very fair and the food is decent! I got a bento box order that came with teriyaki and general tso's chicken with rice. I also got a chai bubble tea. The general tso's chicken was really good but the teriyaki was not great! I did enjoy the tea but thought there were a little too many tapioca pearls in there for my taste. The bento box also said that an egg roll came with it but I didn't receive one. I am sure if I had brought it to the waitress's attention, she would have given me it. But I felt like the amount of food was sufficient. So, no harm, no foul. Overall, I enjoyed going there and would go back! I'd probably switch up my order though and most likely would not get the chicken teriyaki again!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to check out this new restaurant and get some bubble tea. The place is well decorated and has a nice atmosphere. It was pretty busy for lunch when I arrived. They seem to be well-staffed with friendly people.   They offer bubble tea as well as smoothies. Not a ton of flavors, but a decent selection. I ordered just a milk tea, which was served up within a few minutes. You can taste the tea, though it has a bit of a strange, artificial aftertaste. The boba were nice and soft, a little underflavored, but in all pretty decent. I will be back to check out the food as well."}
{"text":"First, let me break down the 3 star rating: If it were not for the prompt correction and customer service, my experience would have warranted 1 star and Lin's would have landed on my restaurant black list (dun dun dun)   It all started out so well. My date and I were craving sushi and it was Labor day. We used our trusty Yelp app to filter sushi restaurants in the 'Burgh but we struck out with the first four restaurants that we called. To our delight, Lin's was open & they had a salmon and tuna sushi special. Score!  We settled on a to-go order of spicy shrimp and vegetable vermicelli noodles, a spicy salmon roll and a tuna lover's roll. We picked the spicy salmon roll because even though the ingredients were not listed, we've had many spicy salmon rolls from other restaurants and the recipe has never been anything but rice, seaweed wrap, salmon & spicy sauce. The ingredients listed for the tuna roll did not include tempura and that is the reason we chose that roll. My date and I both avoid gluten so tempura is a big no no.   Once we picked up the food & settled back in my apartment with our gluten free soy sauce, we were excited to dive into the rolls. That excitement was gone in a hot second when we realized that the spicy salmon roll used tempura as a filler! Instead of using more fish, the sushi chef rolled the salmon in tempura and loaded it into the roll. We opened our Tuna lover's roll and found the same issue!! Let me remind you that tempura was NOT listed in the ingredients for the Tuna lover's roll. At this point, we were unable to eat both of our rolls so my date called Lin's. He explained our situation and they told us that while we should have asked for the specific ingredients of the spicy salmon roll, we were correct about the tuna lover's roll. They offered to re-make our rolls and we could come back down to pick them up. My date had to be at the airport that evening so we were crunched for time. Lin's didn't hesitate, quickly took down my address and about 30 min later, their delivery driver arrived with two fresh, tempura free rolls. He apologized & explained that they hired a new sushi chef and that he tends to make rolls his way rather than following the menu and they are actively trying to fix the issue.  While I believe the driver, I am very disappointed that their sushi chef's method of making rolls is to use tempura as a filler. It's ultimately a cost saver for the restaurant and cut in quality for the consumer. Lin's sushi rolls are not any cheaper than average so the quality shouldn't be either. Due to Lin's customer service & correction, I will not write them off. In fact, I will make sure to ask about their tempura filler the next time I order sushi to see if the problem is corrected...and that's my advice to all of you!"}
{"text":"I stopped by with a few friends for lunch,and we were not disappointed with the overall quality of food! Overall laid back ambience, enjoyed my casual lunch here!  Things I liked: - friendly staff, very welcoming - large portions for lunch specials, which comprise 2 different entrees and and fried rice. I had honey chicken and stir fried vegetables with shrimp. Together they were great for the price! - friends ordered sushi,which they were very pleased with  Things I didn't like: -minimum $10 order for credit cards. I fortunately had cash on hand otherwise I would've had to gingerly ease my way out of this pickle (with puns intended!)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Sesame tofu is ahhhh-mazing!! Service is always great."}
{"text":"The best tuna I've ever had, and I've had a lot of tuna from all over the world.  Fast service and super friendly staff as well! Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Lin's is our go to take-out/delivery spot, our order is always fast and correct.  It's not amazing, but consistent and not sketchy - exactly what I want in my Chinese takeout.  I'll be honest, it took us a few trial and error moments and a brief hiatus for us to get our order right, but now we have it down.   Here it is:  - Triple delight w/ fried rice - Mixed meat udon - Honey chicken w/ steamed rice  Sometimes if we're feeling crazy we'll add: - Singapore Mai Fun - Crab Rangoons - Soup of any kind  We've also eaten in the restaurant and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Food is good but service terrible. I found black hair under my last piece of sushi (worst place for it, I know ). Both my date and I are blonde or auburn so clearly not ours! Told the waitress and neither she nor the manager seemed to care. Needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this restaurant many times, but after the disrespect and disregard they gave us today I will never go back or recommend them.  We ordered our food through grub hub. My husband read the description for his food which didn't have anywhere in it that it contained shrimp. He has a shellfish allergy. When we got our food and his had shrimp in it he immediately called to inform them of the situation. The manager got on the phone and was very rude. He blamed us for not calling to see what was in it and said he didn't make the website so it's not his fault for it being left out of the description. Then he said there is nothing we can do for you if you don't want to waste the food bring it back and I'll eat it. Then he hung up. Very unprofessional and disrespectful."}
{"text":"A really nice atmosphere, nicely decorated and I do love that the windows open to the sidewalk.  The food I think ranges from just OK to OK.  It's not great.    My husband LOVES the Hot & Sour Soup.  It's very spicy.  The Egg Flower Soup is ok.  The wontons in the Wonton Soup were way too thick and doughy for my taste.  The broth was fairly bland.  The Crab Rangoon and Egg Rolls are ok... as is the General Tso's Chicken.  The Kung Pao chicken does have a nice kick.  The Chicken Teriyaki is nothing special.    The hot teas I've tried were very good.  I'm not a bubble tea fan, so I haven't tried any of those.  Overall the food is kinda meh... but it's beautifully plated if you eat in and the atmosphere is nice.  I might stop in to eat if I'm in the mood for Chinese in the South Side, but I won't get it to go again."}
{"text":"My boys and husband would eat Chinese food every day of the week if they could. All four of us were able to have dinner together. It was a little bit of a celebration for my oldest son buying his first car. We all like Lin's so we headed there for dinner.  There are so many great things about Lin's. They have great Bubble Tea, appetizers, and lots of entrees. We started with Crab Rangoon. They are crispy shells filled with crab and cream goodness that come with a dipping sauce that makes a great bite.  We ordered Triple Delight, Street Noodles, Sesame Chicken, and Beef Noodle soup.  The Beef Noodle soup comes out in a big white bowl and smells heavenly. It has pieces of beef, beef broth, huge/thick Udon noodles, mushrooms,  and ski sees of carrots and other veggies. They also bring you out a shaker of \"Magic Seasoning\". I don't know what's in it but you definitely have to put some in your soup.  It brings out even more flavor. They have a Grilled Chicken Noodle soup that's even better. (IMHO).  The Sesame Chicken is small bites of chicken that are quick fried, plated with broccoli and rice and is finished with a sauce that is a little bit sweet but also savory. Sesame seeds are the icing on the cake.  Triple Delight is Beef, Chicken and Shrimp with mushrooms and veggies like carrots, celery and broccoli. It has a savory brown sauce that brings the 3 proteins together.  The Street Noodles are slim noodles that have the color of a yellow curry and smell a bit like curry. It is a little spicy but not so hot that you burn your taste buds.  It's good to know that any time you walk in you are going to be eating hot, fresh, and flavorful food."}
{"text":"Lins is in a great location and the food is okay. I only order vegetables rice and egg rolls when I come here because I am never quite satisfied with the consistency of the chicken. On the other hand, the service is great and there is never a wait to be seated."}
{"text":"Nice selection of decent Chinese food in a pleasant setting.  Tasty noodle dishes.  Portions are adequate ( not huge) and the service was fine.  Location in the middle of the South Side can't be beat for wi dow shopping."}
{"text":"Consistently A-OK food that makes a quick meal eating in the restaurant and provides good delivery service eating at home. The lunch specials have small portions and don't quite satisfy what you really wanted (pre-determined combinations of three options that usually have two you were interested in and one that you wish could be subbed out).  As with most Chinese joints, the trick at Lin's is to order right to achieve maximum food success. You'll find your own path after a few trial-and-errors, but I've learned to stay away from the crab rangoon and egg rolls in favor of the gyoza and hot and sour soup. When it comes to entrees, my favorites include the lo mein, the seafood udon noodle soup, and the coconut chicken. Don't be fooled by how cheap the combination bentos are: your best bet is to order family-style."}
{"text":"I haven't had a problem with this place so far so I don't understand the bad reviews. I do usually order take out and it takes between 15 min to 45 min which isn't bad. I love their spicy garlic entree and bubble tea. Will continue to order take out from here."}
{"text":"I love bubble tea.  I was SO excited to come here just because they had it.  It was just.... mediocre.  Same goes for the food.  I feel like you could go to an Asian place in a mall foo court and get something that would be more flavorful.  I was pretty disappointed since I had higher expectations from the reviews.  To top it off, I had a pretty nasty stomach ache almost immediately following the meal.  My advice is to venture down Carson Street - you're bound to find a better option."}
{"text":"1.5 stars. The food that my boyfriend and I ordered from Lin's Asian Fusion was awful. Not the worst I have ever had, but very low quality and bland. Between the two of us, we ordered the 'egg flower' soup, crab rangoons, coconut chicken and beef and broccoli.  The rangoons had next to no filling and the little filling that there was consisted of cream cheese and sugar--no crabmeat (or even imitation crabmeat) in sight. The soup resembled plain water with garlic powder in it so I ate one spoonful and tossed it. The coconut chicken was mostly fried dough with a few ounces  of gristly chicken thigh meat. The sauce was okay, but nothing I would order again. I did like the pineapple chunks that were part of this dish. The fried rice on the side was flavorless, mushy and had no seasoning or fried egg. HOW DOES A TAKEOUT PLACE MESS UP FRIED RICE?! My boyfriend had the beef and broccoli and said it was terrible and the steamed rice he had with it was a starchy sticky blob. To top off the bad food, our bag came with 2 soy sauce packets and a plastic spoon-- no forks, chopsticks, napkins, etc. The only reason that I am rounding up to two stars instead of down to one is that this is not the worst 'chinese food' that I have ever had. I will not be giving Lin's my business ever again. And the search continues for a decent Chinese takeout spot in the southside..."}
{"text":"***JUST FOR THE BUBBLE TEA***  We saw the sign advertising their bubble tea outside. Got the chai bubble tea wanting to try something new. I asked the woman at the counter if the chai tea was good, she said it was.  The tapioca pearls literally tasted like water, and the taste itself was watery, bland, and didn't even taste anything like tea. We put honey and more milk in it later to make it \"bearable\""}
{"text":"I've had a few friends say this is their favorite restaurant in all of Southside. So when helping a friend move I suggested that we go here. Or maybe she's just suggested that we go there either or it was a good choice.  We walked in and we got seated right away and we just missed the lunch special. While slightly disappointed the full menu was still available and it looked very good.  My friend knew right away what she wanted since she has lived in the south side and comes here lot. I need the little bit more time to look through all the pages. I was pretty impressed with the different options that Lin's had. And I put it on my list to come again to try different options from the menu, after the food was tasted of course.  I went with the eggplant tofu with a side of noodles and she went with one of the Bento boxes. All I know from her bento box is that she got some Sesame crispy tofu and it was delicious and I will be getting that the next time that I come.  My dish came on a plate kind of like a fajita. It was very steamy and sizzling for a lot longer than I would have liked because it was so hot I couldn't eat it. And then I also felt bad because the steam was just blowing into my friend's face. She was a good sport and said that she liked it and she said it was like a steam bath with delicious flavors. But it still made me feel a little bit bad.   The eggplant was cooked perfectly and all the vegetables were delicious. The sauce was light and did not overtake everything and didn't give me that sticky feeling of heaviness that some Asian sauces do. I think that I would have liked crispy tofu instead of just the regular tofu because it probably would have stayed together easier. But all in all the meal was very good.  I look forward to trying more things on the menu especially their sushi and their bento box. And a little taste of that Sesame tofu has had me hooked and waiting to go back soon to get some of that. If you're in the Southside try it out."}
{"text":"It's disappointing to walk into a restaurant as a business traveler, place an order, and have them refuse your corporate card because there is a minimum charge. This is contrary to their agreement with card providers, and resulted in me walking out. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is anything you could want in lunchtime. Fast, tasty, fresh ingredients. Berry attentive staff. Call ahead and get takeout, it is usually ready within ten minutes. This isn't gourmet but is much better than any other Chinese on the South Side."}
{"text":"This has become our go-to Chinese/Pan Asian take out place. Yes, they do have in-house dining, but the atmosphere seems \"meh\". However, the food is spot-on. The chicken fried rice has become my husband's new favorite. We both enjoy their Bento box options for lunch and dinner. I usually get General Tso's chicken, but recently branched out and tried their seafood soup to my delight. I'm hoping to explore more of their menu in the coming months.  Also, LOVE that they have online ordering, however it does take longer than calling or picking up yourself."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very pleasant atmosphere. Loved all the vegan/vegetarian options!!  Jill was very helpful with menu suggestions and great service. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed here, as they offer pretty straightforward Asian food. The sushi is good, but I've noticed they don't ever get the rolls very tight. I really love the wanton soup, especially for the price. I got a small cup and there were three delish wantons (I almost want to say they were dumplings). If you order a smoothie bubble drink, ask for it in a to-go cup. TRUST ME. I ordered a pineapple smoothie and it came heaped into a little martini glass, spilling all over the place and dripping down the sides. Also, I had no idea how to approach drinking it. My meal was good. I sat outside and the waitress kept coming out to tell me \"not to rush,\" I wasn't, but for some reason that made me feel a little uncomfortable!"}
{"text":"Easily the best Chinese food in Pittsburgh! Everything was fresh and delicious. And the food arrived very fast and was still steaming hot! Try their delicious bento lunch boxes!"}
{"text":"I love coming here especially on friday nights because nothing stops the servers from being on top of their game with speedy service. Not to mention the best pad Thai in the city. If you don't come to lins your missing out."}
{"text":"I like their bubble tea, they offer hot and cold bubble tea with many flavors. The food is good too.  My Order: Original (Milk Black) Bubble Tea"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, and great food! The General Tso's Tofu was just right. I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"It's pretty good. Definitely better than common Asian restaurants in surrounding PGH area.  They offer some choices that are seldom available in other establishments. The avocado rolls are divine and their avocado milk tea was too. Their mango smoothie was fantastic. Everything that came out had great presentation!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would, we placed an order on grubhub, we waited an hour and then we got a call from grubhub saying they canceled our order and wouldn't deliver to us bc it was too far...we are 10 min away from them, screw this place. I will never order again."}
{"text":"Delicious and the delivery is insanely fast. We tend to get the same items each time that we order but we know what we like. I order an item that's not on the menu and they are more than happy to make it!"}
