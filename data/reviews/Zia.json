{"text":"Skip this place.   Sweet owner, good wine, great attitude, however extremely sub par food.  Red sauce was ehhhh at best.  Fish  of the day was unimpressive and the accompanying salad had wilted greens.

We didn't risk dessert.  You can do better"}
{"text":"The staff is very nice, answered all of the questions we had concisely and understandingly, and was very accommodating throughout the meal. The food was delicious and filling. 

The prices are a bit high, however, and I just can't shake the feeling that there are better places around the city to get more bang for your buck. If you have money to spend without remorse though, I suppose it would be worth a stop."}
{"text":"My family ate at Restaurant Zia last week when we were visiting Montreal and simply wanted to eat close to our hotel after a long and exhausting day out at Six Flags-La Ronde.   I did not know what to expect at first, but we were all really pleased with the experience.  Zia serves Italian-style (as opposed to Americanized) Italian food that is fresh and light.  My wife and I both enjoyed our pasta with seafood and a great glass of white wine.  But what really amazed me is that all of our kids--a tired and often picky lot--were very happy with their food.  The pizzas in particular were a huge hit, and two of my kids declared it the best they had ever had.  Take that comment for what it is worth, but I tried the pizza too and thought it was really good.  The staff was very friendly and did a great job with our kids.  This is a good Italian restaurant, and I don't think you will go wrong here."}
{"text":"Beautiful and tasty Italian food. Special staff that makes great not on the menu recommendations. Feels like having a meal with family! Homemade taste. If you're downtown, stop in very welcoming!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Delicious food in a very relaxed atmosphere. 

The menu is Italian, diversed(ish) but whatever we ate was cooked to perfection and was tasting great. 

The wine list is decent as well as the price. 

We always got an extra touch of class. 

Sincerely recommended"}
{"text":"J'ai vécu une expérience différente là-bas puisque l'endroit où je travaille a réservé le restaurant pour notre souper de Noël. Nous avons été bien accueilli avec un verre et un beau sourire du personnel qui a été présent et agréable tout au long de la soirée.
Le restaurant est petit et convivial. Bien décoré et propre!

Côté bouffe, nous avons commencé avec des antipasto qui étaient simples et bons. Ensuite, nous avons eu une entrée de gnocchis avec une simple sauce tomate... simple, mais délicieux. 

Nous avions ensuite le choix entre le veau marsala, l'agneau ou la morue. J'ai choisi le veau et il était succulent, quoique ma portion était petite par rapport aux autres. D'autres personnes à ma table ont pris l'agneau et la morue. Ils ont aussi apprécié leur plat. Seul bémol, le souci de vouloir amener les assiettes au table le plus en même temps possible a fait que celles-ci sont arrivées parfois tièdes au table... à corriger pour les prochains groupes. Petite mention sur la demande d'une personne végétarienne à ma table. Elle a rapidement reçu un risotto aux champignons qui avait l'air excellent!  Bravo pour le service :)

Pour le dessert, nous avions de petites pâtisseries qui terminaient bien le repas. 

Un beau petit à essayer au centre-ville :)"}
{"text":"Okay, but not great.Probably more like 2.5 stars.
Ambience: Pretty ordinary.
Service: Friendly waiter.
Food: Meh. I had the seafood pasta which would have been very good but for having about 5X too much garlic (and this coming from a garlic fan). The accompanying bread was dry and tasteless.
Price: I'm sure you could find better elsewhere for the same price.
In short, nothing special and I'd be unlikely to go back."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian cuisine. As an Italian I really enjoyed the simple and pure Italian dishes. The service was prompt, accommodating and attentive. OH, and the tiramisu was great!"}
{"text":"Very good Tuscan resto with an impressive wine list. Its a bit crowded at lunch and laid back and peaceful at dinner. A very nice pre Habs game option."}
{"text":"Tiny restaurant, small menu, huge portions of good food. They treat guests like family.  Bring out bruschetta before the meal. Followed the meal with little Italian cookies and fresh fruit.  Made something at my sons request that was no longer on the menu."}
{"text":"Nice staff workers, but the quality is far from being Italian and French cuisine. The Escargot is good, but the prices are way too much. You'll find better restaurants at Vieux Montreal."}
