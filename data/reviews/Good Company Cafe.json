{"text":"Went here multiple times while in Las Vegas for a week. Had the Italian and Vegas heat sandwiches. Both were fantastic and made fresh to order. I also had a macaroni salad on the side which was delicious. I highly recommend trying one of the smoothies, especially pina colada. If you have a chance to come check it out it's definitely worth it. Plus they now have online ordering so you can skip the wait!! 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"I got the spicy quinoa wrap and it was delicious! The service was really fast and only had to wait about 5 minutes for my wrap to be ready.   If you are not a fan of spicy food, just choose a different sauce."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch before leaving Las Vegas for home... the employees were great and the sandwiches were perfect. After a week in Vegas we were craving a healthy light lunch and we were lucky to find this place. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I didn't know this place existed til today and I'm pleasantly surprised. I'm happy that a healthy new sandwich place exists around the corner from me. They have a wide assortment of choices that are unique and tasty.   I got the Vegas Heat chicken panini and my girlfriend got the kale wrap. We liked them both as well as their macaroni salad and we'll be coming back soon for sure."}
{"text":"I got the Prime Rib Steak sandwich. They said they made their own horseradish so I was excited but I couldn't really taste it when I got it. Maybe they didn't put enough. I also wanted to try the potato salad because I love a good potato salad. But the sandwich and potato salad were nothing to come running back to this place for. It wasn't bad but nothing stood out to me either. It's so close to my house so maybe I'll try more sandwiches. I guess I was hoping to find another sandwich shop like Sourdough Eatery.  Sincerely not a mean girl"}
{"text":"The wife and I love the sandwiches at Good Company Cafe. I hope more people find this place because I want it to stay open. The signage facing the street isn't very visible. I have driven by a couple times and caught the 'open' light off.  The Dagwood and their Philly are among my faves, but the sandwich that tops out on my list is Vegas Heat. Vegas Heat is not so much filling, but the flavor and the heat is on point. Wifeys faces are the In Da Club and the Dagwood. Kiddies approve of the smoothies, but they've never had a a bad one."}
{"text":"First time here and this place did not disappoint! From the food to the customer service. Everything was phenomenal. Definitely coming back!     I ordered the grilled chicken wrap and asked them make it into a salad with spinach and kale and omg it was delicious! Their lemony vinaigrette was so mouthwatering! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"So excited to eat at this restaurant after reading so many great reviews.  Just got off a 4 day cleanse and was anxious to try the veg broth and kale quinoa wrap.  My wife and I walked in about 1 pm and immediately saw a worker in glasses sitting on the counter crossed leg then noticed another worker sitting at the table doing paperwork.  There was no greeting no rush to get off the counter or table just blank stares. Walked over to the girl sitting on the counter by the cash register and she said starring out in space not looking at us, the menus over there for more.  My wife grabbed a menu we sat at a table and I told my wife we can't eat here I don't feel welcomed let's go. We got up she returned the menu and no one said anything to her and we walked out. Sad sad sad, so cold and heartless."}
{"text":"We are from California and came to Las Vegas for the weekend. We were looking for healthy eating and smoothies and found both at this cafe.       The smoothies were delicious! We ordered The Tropical, and added kale to The Stand By Your Mango. They had just the right sweetness to it. They will customize your smoothie and even give you any leftovers from your batch. Nice!      We also ordered The Broth Bowl with everything in it. It was really good, although there were too many jalapeños(15)for one bowl of soup. Personally, I would have preferred fresh jalapeños,  just a slice or 2 to give the soup some kick.       We will be back because we really liked what we ordered and the service with a smile was outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"Good food.   Having a pastrami sandwich for lunch.   Near tender and you can have it the way you want it.  Plenty of meat on the sandwich.   I'll return to try other sandwiches.   Recommend you try the Cafe."}
{"text":"Locally owned and phenomenal well-priced food! The menu caters to all and is customizable. We tried the Cali Turkey, Turkey Panini  and the Red, White & Blue Smoothie with almond milk instead of yogurt-all of which were flavorful, large and full of fresh ingredients. Would highly recommend this place and the owner(s) who are superb. They're still waiting for their outside sign but it's located in the old Pita Pit location next to Zabas."}
{"text":"I have been here about three times and what is so amazing about this place, is the way the staff will bend over backwards to customize your meal, no matter how complicated and strange, you don't get that typical \"we can't do that\".  They also try to use all \"clean non-gmo food\" and they support local farmers. The music is great and the food is exactly the way I order, freshly made and delicious.  I order the broth bowls and smoothies, it's hard to find good tasty and healthy broth bowls in this town."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and the service equally so! The macaroni salad is delicious I would highly recommend it.  I think I've found my new favorite lunch place! Can't wait to try a smoothie next time I go."}
{"text":"I should have written this one awhile ago! These guys just plain get it. The best sandwiches in Henderson and in Las Vegas! I have had every sandwich on the menu except two and I can safely say they are all amazing. My personal fave is the Prime Rib sandwich (I can't quit it).   My only regret is I travel so much for work that I can't eat here more often. Go here for your sandwich fix! You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, food was prompt.  And Wow, the Spicy Quinoa Kale Wrap is amazing!!  Just enough spice and fresh veggies.  Can't wait to go back and try the other menu options."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!  The food is outstanding...everything fresh and made to order while being very quick! We had the spicy kale quinoa wrap, spinach mushroom cheese panini and red white blue smoothie.  I am super picky and mostly eat what I cook at home because it is hard to find really good fresh food restaurants.  We are visiting from Houston and found this place by accident! This was the best money spent our entire trip.  I wish I could take this cafe and the gracious owners back to Houston!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich and smoothie I've ever had. No exaggerations. Everything is so delicious and SO FRESH. They have a great vegetarian selection. Also both girls working were so nice!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat! They have great options for hearty sandwiches and for vegetarians too! The ingredients are as fresh as they come, and everything is made to order. The owners and employees are amazingly friendly. They offer to remake anything you don't like for free, but everything we've had here has been incredible and we've been here four times in two weeks! You can tell by talking to the owners that they really have a passion for what they do. The prices are reasonable and the portion sizes are great. I tell everyone I can about this place and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was attracted to this place because of the reviews and pictures.  I ordered 3 pastrami sandwiches, vegetable broth and 3 mango smoothies.  The server wrote down what and how I wanted the pastrami sandwiches done. This was a waste of time because he got the order wrong.  Three sandwiches were done with rye bread when only one was ordered with rye bread.  I can keep going on with what they screwed up on the sandwiches but I'll spare you.  The vegetable broth was supposed to come with quinoa.  I saw none!  I give every business a chance and I want food places to succeed but this place was highly disappointing!  I spent 48$ and change and tipped so it was over 50$.  I've had better sandwich experiences at subway.  The sandwiches for the size are over priced and the pastrami was sub par!  The ratings for this place are not legitimate.  I'll never go back to this place and I wouldn't be surprised if they won't be open in 3 years!"}
{"text":"Everyone from my work was telling me how good this place was and how nice the people are so I had to try it and my coworkers were right! You can't find many places in Vegas where the people are this nice and helpful! I had the Vegas wrap and it was DELISH! So fresh. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great little place!  Try the broth bowl soup! Amazing!  Becoming one of my favorite places to get healthy food for a good price!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. I had a turkey sandwich with provolone and avocado and it was amazing. Super fresh and tasty. The owners are so sweet and really allow you to enjoy your time eating and enjoying your company. Highly recommend this sweet gem."}
{"text":"the hospitality and quality of customer service here is amazing! the smoothies are simple and delicious and not to mention great prices on the menu. thank you guys!"}
{"text":"I didn't check any reviews on this spot. Although all i wanted was a smoothie and i didn't want Tropical Smoothie or Jamba Juice so I just trusted that since it was at the top of the list when i searched \"smoothie\". It was definitely a delicious smoothie especially that it had almond milk for substitutions. I got two different smoothies and they were both very yummy! I'm very glad i found this spot especially bcuz their menu looks really good with \"clean food\". I will definitely return for more than a smoothie next time."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 10 stars! My husband and I have recently decided to change our diet. We're in our mid-forties and retirement will be here before we know it. We have plans for that, and they don't include being completely sedentary and sick. But!! We're from the Deep South, where bacon grease flavors ALL vegetables. Good Company is close to home, had good Yelp reviews and looked promising, so we figured we'd give it a try. I had a portabella panini with white bean spread (house made) instead of cheese, husband had the spicy quinoa kale wrap.  This was absolutely one of the best meals I have EVER eaten, vegan or otherwise. I was BLOWN AWAY! I had no idea I could enjoy a vegan meal every bit as much as, and even more than, the most delicious high-fat, high-carb, blah blah blah meals I've had. Did NOT think I liked quinoa. Apparently, what I've had before wasn't done right. ;) The wrap was so good, I've had two more since that first visit, which was 3 days ago. Addictive, omg yes. I find myself daydreaming about them. And finally, if you're lucky enough to visit when the owner is there, as we were, her knowledge is impressive, and her enthusiasm is contagious. Such a sweet, happy person!!! My family and I LOVE this place (kids had the Cubano and one of the kale quinoa wraps), and we hope it stays around a long, long time!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome healthy good eats. We had the mushroom panini and the hearty soup broth. Added chicken and picked out our favorites Vegis from the items listed and it was Yumazing! Definitely coming here again to try out something new. Was thinking of the chicken caprese wrap next?"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch since it is close to my house. It must be pretty new since I've never noticed it before but was intrigued by the great yelp reviews. There was a couple people in front of us but ordering went pretty quick. The menu is on the board as well as printed out on the counter. There is a hearty side and a healthy side to the menu consisting mostly of sandwiches and wraps. I ordered the spicy quinoa wrap. My food took about 15/20 min to come out which was kind of surprising since it wasn't very crowded and nothing had to be cooked. It was really really good though! My boyfriends order never came out as they forgot to put it in but they were very apologetic. They even gave us 2 free side salads and chips! The staff went over the top to make sure we were satisfied with our meals and to make up for the mistake. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Love!  Add to your foodie list for sure.  The wait time is absolutely worth it for the quality product. Vegetarian and Vegan options. Abigal and her husband  brought real genuine stellar customer service.  Refreshing to be genuinely greeted with a warm welcome. I hope they add themselves to eat24, bitesquad or Ubereats."}
{"text":"Fanstastic food and Incredible service! I got the superfood wrap and my boyfriend got the Vegas Heat sandwich. We were both extremely happy. It really felt like our food was made with love ^.^ We're excited for our next visit!"}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Classic Kale Wrap\" and it was pretty good. The employees gave me a little scare, because they weren't familiar with the ingredients, and I am Vegan. The manager told me the spinach wrap wasn't vegan, but went and double checked, and saw that of course it was, and the other employee didn't know what was in the white bean spread.  All in all - good food, ok employees. Respect"}
{"text":"I found this sandwich shop on a whim as I was in the area and I'm glad I did.  Customer service was great: we were greeted promptly and given a menu to look at. The food was made fresh to order which I love. I had a turkey sandwich and husband had a prime rib. We also ordered a pineapple smoothie which was good. It was the perfect lunch.  I think this place is super cute and has a lot of potential. I would visit again."}
{"text":"I received a text from Yelp that this place was opening so I thought I would try it out.  Went there today for lunch, there was no sign so it was hard to find but there was a sign outside that a better sign was coming. The place was very clean, the people working there were very nice. I ordered a Grilled Chicken Wrap for $7.99 and a drink and my total was a little over $10. The wrap came with grilled chicken, cheese, mushrooms, grilled onion and jalapeños. It was a little spicier than I thought it would be but it was pretty tasty. While we were there we were offered some macaroni salad and I love macaroni salad so I was excited to try it. It was light with shredded carrots and it was so good. It wasn't on the menu that I saw but I'm sure it will be. I would definitely recommend this place. They have quite a bit of other foods like smoothies, quinoa broth bowl (that looked pretty interesting), vegan foods and other healthy items. It's facing Silverado Ranch a few doors down from Panda Express."}
{"text":"Transitioning into a Vegan diet is not easy. I came in to find a Vegetarian/Vegan spot that could satisfy my hunger and not break the bank.  I had to try everything Vegan. I got large broth bowl with everything in it! The Spicy Quinoa with tomato basil wrap and added Avocado for $1. I also had the tropical smoothie. Everything I had was delicious. Wow who knew how delicious going Vegan can really be:) I'm not 100% Vegan yet but this place will definitely help me with that!!"}
{"text":"Support this local business! Super friendly owners serving good clean meat, vegan, and vegetarian options. Steak sandwich with horse radish is a strong choice as is the build your own broth bowl."}
{"text":"Stopped in 30 minutes before closing. The staff greeted us with a friendly attitude. We ordered 2 sandwiches and chips and they were great! They have a great menu and I am looking forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"In town for my sons basketball tourney and we had a two hour gap between games. Found the good company cafe and enjoyed a club sandwich, the kids had a delicious toasted turkey Sammy and each had a smoothie.  Service was superb and the food was delicious. I wish I had one of these back home. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"We placed a phone order for pick up yesterday. My review is based solely on that process.  1. Phone ordering: 5 stars! Totally personable and polite staff. We had a few questions about the menu (various dietary restrictions) and had every question answered right away and got some good suggestions for substitutions. Super easy ordering.  2. Pickup: 5 stars! I got there right as the order was being finished (right on time). They even labeled everything. Anyone who orders for a crowd knows how awesome that is! It sure made my job easier!  3. Food: 5 stars! Everything was perfectly made. The food was delicious. They even remembered all the sides I asked for. No complaints here!  Overall, an amazing experience. We will be ordering from here again soon."}
{"text":"This shop is by my house, so we decided to come in for a try. We were instantly greeted with energy and friendliness. I believe the lady was the owner. She helped us out with the menu and gave us the option to have a create your own anything. I decided to get the cubano and my girlfriend went with the chicken panini with mushrooms.   The cubano: Once I took a bite out of the sandwich, you get the juiciness of the ham and the crunch from the pickles. Everything in this sandwich was fresh. Every part of the sandwich was pure quality.   The manager came up to us as we were half way through to see how was everything. She's very energetic and I believe this is how all shops/restaurants should be.   If you're hungry for some great tasting sandwiches, please make your way to good company. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I saw this place from the road expecting a normal cafe, but it was much more than that. The food and experience exceeded everything I hoped for. The ingredients are all organic, made in-house, and delicious. It's a proteinhouse at an affordable price, with waaayyyy better food. Finally a $6 or $7 lunch spot that you can go to after the gym or when you just want to put something good in your body and not crappy fast food. The couple who own the joint are some of the most humble and compassionate people I've ever met. They saw that a place like this didn't exist, so they took the matter into their own hands. Get the spicy quinoa wrap. Soo good!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches (vegan/vegetarian options if you're into that sort of thing). I am by no means a health conscience eater, I'm only interested in taste. That's the cool thing about this place, you can do both! It's healthy or at least made with local high quality ingredients aaaaand it tastes good. Don't forget to try a smoothie!"}
{"text":"Vegan friendly. We got the Super Food Wrap and the Hot Veg Out sandwiches and they were excellent. And the owner is very friendly. We will be back."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to meet for an impromptu dinner; found this place on yelp and decided to try it. A wonderful experience! The service was great and friendly. I had the pastrami on rye and the orange creamsicle smoothie, and everything was delicious. I still don't know how I managed to save half my sandwich to take home and share. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So very happy with our order. I got the prime rib sandwich and added their house made horseradish to it. A lot of their ingredients are made in house and are amazing. My order took 20 min from the time I ordered to when they handed me my order- but well worth the wait! They just hired some new people and that was the reason for the wait. The owner offered me a free drink for the wait. Everyone was extremely nice and you could tell they were proud of the restaurant and food :) we will be back!"}
{"text":"I will do this a as a limerick:  There was the good company sandwich place Who said this is the best food to put in your face.  The service was slow, The quality low I can make a better sandwich at my own space.   In response to the proprietor's response,  waiting a long time for good food is one thing, waiting for meh food I ca do myself is another."}
{"text":"This is the perfect restaurant for my husband and I. I have been trying to eat clean and there are so many options to choose from. This place lived up to its name. Fresh, flavorful, guilt free options that leave you feeling satisfied and energized. The broth bowl is amazing!!! I will get it as a side every time! So flavorful and a perfect pair to any wrap or sandwich. I tried the gluten free power wrap with lemon vinaigrette, but couldn't stop and take a photo due to its deliciousness. I wish I could explain the flavors! Original innovative menu that I wish I could emulate at home, but luckily the price is right so I won't have to. Also, the PINA COLADA smoothie is addicting!!! So good I came back the next day to get another. Might take it home and add a little rum next time  ;) This will be a regular stop for us!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb! Stopped in for a quick lunch. We had the spicy kale and quinoa wrap and the prime rib sandwich. Yummy, freshly toasted, and they even let me add all the veggies on mine and left off all the things my husband doesn't like! The two ladies working there were so nice! Great spot for lunch!!"}
{"text":"Amazing portobello panini sandwich. It's like you made it at home but without having to clean the kitchen. The potatoes salad is super fresh tasting. My new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"WWOOWWW!!!!!! What a great new find!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    I am always looking for a new restaurant to try and today I found the best new find in quite a while.     My gf and I are always looking for a place that makes homemade soup from scratch. It shouldn't be that difficult but not many places make homemade soup as they prefer to open a bag or can.    Not here!!!!! The concept here is new and amazing. You can custom order your soup by selecting which ingredients you would like included in the housemade vegetable broth. The veggies you choose are then steamed and married with the broth to create a custom soup each time. Choices include a wide range of veggies and you can also include some protein choices like chicken, tofu,etc.        Now, onto the sandwich. We chose the prime rib philly which was super tender and tasty. We ordered it with peppers, mushrooms, onions and cheese.  Horseradish on the side for me. A most delicious choice we made. It was also served on a GREAT BUN which is from a local bakery here in town which we all know and love.      Since we were here mid afternoon and it wasn't busy, we had the pleasure of meeting the owners, Brandon and Abigail. They both do all the cooking and prep work here. They are both super nice and take a lot of pride in the food they make. Most everything here is made in house including sauces, spreads, chicken marinade and soup broth.    Everything here is great. It's a nice feeling to have a new locally owned restaurant nearby with a new product that made us feel good. We will return soon."}
{"text":"This place is SO much better than the Pita Pit that was here before. I love that you can choose between healthy and not so healthy options and truly serve everyone's appetite. I ordered the chicken crepese in the gluten free tortilla and although the tortilla got soggy pretty quickly (expected) it was so tasty! The best part is the staff though, once they handed me the food they said, \"even though this is to go, let us know if you there is ANYTHING wrong with it and we'll make it right the next time you come in.\" It felt so genuine and I felt really appreciated as a customer.   Looking forward to my next visit to try more items!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in again for a fabulous lunch. Had the pastrami sandwich right off the menu and a side of homemade potato salad. Everything is made fresh to order and takes a little bit longer than the assembly-line chains but it is so worth the wait!  I really want to try one of the broth bowls but the lineup on the sandwich menu is just too tempting every time!!"}
{"text":"So good and in the perfect spot. They had my crazy order perfect and there were a lot of vegan options."}
{"text":"I drive by this place often and finally decided to give it a try on a whim.  My girlfriend and I walked in 15 minutes before they were set to close. I felt bad about coming in so close to their closing time, but the staff was fantastic.  They took the time to answer questions and go over their menu in detail.  You could tell they genuinely care about their product and their customers.  The place was clean and believe you could have a comfortable meal there (we took our order to go for the staff's sake).  You roll the dice with a lot of restaurants when you walk in so close to their closing time.  The food can taste like it's been sitting out for awhile.  Everything we ordered was made-to-order and the ingredients tasted fresh.  Again, another sign that they care about their product.  I ordered a Vegas Heat and my girlfriend ordered an Italian with a smoothie.  We both enjoyed our sandwiches and my girlfriend couldn't stop raving about their smoothie.    Would highly recommend if you're looking for a sandwich or smoothie!"}
{"text":"Didn't even know a new place opened here as so many restaurants have shut in this location! Great Pastrami Sandwich and for it to be Nitrate/Nitrite free makes it all the more reason to keep going back.   The prices for top quality ingredients are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Prime rib sandwich was really tasty. The bread and horseradish make it great!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is it took 20 minutes to get 3 sandwiches with only person ahead of us."}
{"text":"So happy there is a good sandwich shop in this area! The staff was super friendly, and the house made ingredients and fresh food totally make this place stand out. Can't wait to keep trying the menu!"}
{"text":"This is my second time eating at Good Company Cafe and the food is so delicious and healthy! The first time I got a chicken caprese salad and this time I got the spicy quinoa kale wrap but I subbed out kale for spinach since I'm not a kale person and it was delicious! I'm glad that there is a healthy restaurant nearby!"}
{"text":"They have amazing customer service! The lady who made my sandwiches was friendly. The food was on point."}
{"text":"A couple of things to know - get a Cubano (with swiss cheese - the correct way), and wash it down with a Creamsicle smoothie.  You'll have a good day.  This new addition to the southeast features sandwiches on the healthy side and on the hearty side. Having the option of being \"good\" or being \"bad\" at lunch makes me happy.  I like options.  The crew here is very friendly and they engage with their guests.  I like the setting, but wish they had music in the dining room - that would make dining in more enjoyable.  There are a large amount of things that they make fresh on site, and anyone who is choosing to make  ingredients instead of buying them is ok with me.  I hope they do well.  The name of the place fits them to a T."}
{"text":"I asked for tropical smoothy and had to substitute couple items and the owner was being really patient about my order. In the meantime he explained every single item my friends asked. The smoothy was delicious and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Holy cow this place is so good. There is a reason they have a 5 star average. The sandwich was so good I didn't even have time to take a picture.  I will take one the next time I'm here, which will be soon. Great job."}
{"text":"Great sandwich and smoothie spot! Got the Cubano and i was really impressed it actually tasted like a real Cuban sandwich. Very rarely do i find places that actually know how to make them. Cuban restaurants out here don't even know how to make them lol. Im Cuban by the way :) I also got the chocolate banana smoothie delish especially I this hot weather. Will definitely be back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Wish they had a place like this in California. We're here on vacation and we're tired of heavy tired ass vacation food. This was just the thing. A simple broth bowl and a sandwich. Both were really really good. And the staff is the best. New place to come when we come out to Vegas ! Thanks good company!"}
{"text":"Great place for healthy sandwiches and smoothies!! Owner is warm and welcoming. Wished I lived around here to eat here more often."}
{"text":"Really good for lunch. I had the \"In Da Club\". They forgot to put my order in but were super apologetic about it and gave me two additional sides (macaroni salad is awesome) and extra chips. Everything I had was good."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed my meals here. The service is friendly, the Smoothies are great. I would recommend the Cuban, they do a great job on it."}
{"text":"Great place for a sandwich took my girlfriend she love the house  Turkey . I love the chicken caperse (I think I spelled that wrong ) Great atmosphere,  Variety of choices from Vegan to meats , protein shakes or smoothies best place hands down ."}
{"text":"Holy moly this place is awesome. The staff is incredible and the food is delicious. So far I've tried the steakhouse sandwich, broth bowl and a Smoothie. You can customize everything and they use super fresh ingredients. I've been twice and I'm very impressed.   The steakhouse sandwich is there take on a Philly but somehow it's better. Great sandwich! The broth bowl is a create your own, do you can add whatever you want. The broth has really good flavor on its own.   I can't rave enough about the staff. They seem genuinely interested in providing quality service. Super friendly and they remember their guests. They go out of their way to give that extra bit. My only complaint is that they aren't open 24/7 so that I can get my fix whenever I want it."}
{"text":"Guys you have to support this place. Genuine and excellent service, clean, great atmosphere, and all their ingredients are natural. You can remix your sandwhiches, smoothies, and soups to suit any dietary needs (gluten/dairy/sugar free) and the food is DELICIOUS. first time here, we got the red,white,blue smoothie, a berry blast smoothie with almond milk, a gluten free spicy kale wrap, and a In Da Club sandwich. 5 stars on all 4 items. I'm in love with this place!"}
{"text":"Everytime I go in here, they are so nice, and very helpful.  I've been waiting for a good sandwich, and I think I found it.  There prices are very reasonable.  The sandwich on the white roll is a very nice size.  I couldn't eat the whole thing.    Now for the Prime rib sandwich.  So that roll was so soft (I wasn't expecting that)  I almost went withe the 7 grain sandwich bread, because I didn't think the roll wasn't going to be that soft.  You can add all the ingredients you like.   That prime rib was so tender, you wouldn't even know you were taking a bite of meat!  It was just as soft as the roll!  YESSSSSSSS!    I can't wait to try a new sandwich from this place."}
{"text":"From the moment i walked in the staff was so friendly and welcoming, felt like I'd been coming here for years. Got the Dagwood sandwich. Love how they cook the bacon on the grill right then and there. No microwaves in sight;)  All fresh ingredients and locally bought bread. They even let me add portabello mushrooms and artichoke hearts for free!!! Imagine what Subway would charge for chokes and bello's haha!!!  When i asked to leave a tip, the nicest lady ever told me that my satisfaction was the only tip i needed to leave. She was so sweet! And also told me if i wasn't satisfied my next sandwich is on the house. Now that's customer service at its finest! Can't wait to come back! If i could give them 6 stars I would, awh geez, who am i kidding, 7 STARS ALL DAY!! Keep up the outstanding work you guys!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The Good Company Cafe never disappoints! I've been under the weather lately and the broth bowl was just what I needed. Homemade vegetable broth with quinoa and grilled veggies. You can choose a small or large bowl and the large bowl is definitely a large serving! This was my third time visiting Good Company and the food is always good and the staff are always helpful and friendly.  Great vegetarian/vegan options!"}
{"text":"Now, this is a sandwich!! The portions are the best I have seen. The taste is so good! Service was excellent! Hates off to this new place! Glad it's near home :)"}
{"text":"You might have to wait a few minutes but totally worth it for these delicious sandwiches. I got a vegetarian pesto sandwich with kale and it was phenomenal and I'm not even a vegetarian! My husband got a sandwich with three different meats which he devoured.  We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place yesterday, and already went again today. I have been wishing upon countless stars that a decent sandwich shop would open up near me, and at least one of those stupid stars came through. Thanks universe! The Prime Rib Steak House is my favorite so far, I had a bite of the Kale Panini and that was tasty as well. I'm excited to have a different default sandwich place instead of going to Jersey Mike's 30 times a week. The staff is very friendly and personable as well, very welcoming and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Super clean food, fresh, and local products.  I got the chicken caprese, which was phenomenal, and my girl got the prime rib sandwich, which was also amazing.  Abigail and Brandon, (the owners) are super friendly and you can tell they put love into their food.  If you want a good meal check this place out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places I have eaten in Las Vegas. Everything is made fresh in house. Nothing is store bought. One of the best smoothies I have ever had in my life. The Orangesicle and the Pina colada smoothies are heaven. The bone broth is fantastic. I recommend the turkey club but honestly anything you order will be fantastic. We need more eateries such as this one with fresh and quality products. The owner is so nice and the employee working was so friendly. It is nice to see individuals still passionate about food. This place is a must try for anyone."}
{"text":"I see why they call it good company, cause it really was. I decided to come in for a quick bite alone and the vibes were just right. Everyone was very friendly and helpful with menu items. I tried the vegas heat and strawberry banana smoothie. Both were very tasty. I'll definitely be coming back to try other stuff!"}
{"text":"Our first stop after a long drive from LA to Vegas. It was awesome being greeted by a superbly friendly staff. Our sandwiches were PERFECTION. Must try the prime rib sandwich and grilled chicken wrap!"}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow! Great vegetarian options with amazingly friendly staff. Meat options look great too. What a great find. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was in town celebrating my 21st birthday and my friends and I decided to stop by this place on our way back to LA.  I ordered the Kale Caprese with avocado as an add on and it was THE BEST sandwich ever!!! I'm newly vegetarian, so finding good and flavorful food is so hard sometimes!! The Kale was so amazingly flavored and the cheese, tomatoes, avocado, and pesto tasted so awesome and fresh. I was shockingly impressed. All of my friends REALLY enjoyed their orders as well. Everything was so light but filling at the same time, and it was just what all of us needed after a long weekend of partying.   There were three couples and we all ordered separately. My only complaint would be the wait for the food. Sadly we all ate at different times because the food took forever to come. The first couple's order (two sandwiches and a smoothie) came out about 20 minutes after they put in the order. Mine and my boyfriend's order (also two sandwiches and a smoothie) came out next but not until about another 25 minutes after, so my friends had already finished eating. The last couple's order (two sandwiches and two broths) came out about 30 minutes after mine.   We all LOVED our food but I would recommend that they hire more staff to avoid long waits like this. Aside from this issue that could be easily fixed, customer service was ok. The two ladies that helped us were sweet but fairly quiet but again the food was SOSOSOSOSO amazing so we didn't care.   When I'm in town again, I am going to make sure I come back here!! I'm already craving that sandwich again and it hasn't even been 24 hours. Lol I WISH THERE WAS ONE IN LA :("}
{"text":"I've been here twice and each time had a great sandwich. The owner is super nice and staff is friendly. They are willing to customize your sandwich just the way you like it too. Smoothies are really good too. Everything is really fresh.  I will be making this my regular sandwich place."}
{"text":"OMG, this place is the bomb. I'm basing this on one of the best lunches my wife and I have ever had in a cafe.   I had the spicy kale quinoa wrap and she had a portabella mushroom sandwich, both were warm and so flavorful. I almost hate to leave a review because I want to keep this place a secret.  I'm about to make a return trip for some loaded broth veggie bowls.  The spicy kale wrap was delicious!"}
{"text":"This is the second time here.  They have a pretty good menu with selections for meat lovers as well as Vegetarian/Vegan options.  The smoothies are a good variety and the have broth bowls and then you select what veggies you want as well as any protein if you desire.  Overall the prices are not bad compared to other places; at least here you know what you are getting is fresh.  The place is not bad, they have 6 four top tables and a counter with 3 seats.  The place is very clean and the food is actually pretty good here.  The only down side to this place is that they normally have two people working and since everything is made to order, they only prepare one order at a time, so if there are people in front of you, you will be waiting a very long time to receive anything you order.  We came in and the place was full when we got here.  We ordered 2 smoothies and two broth bowls.  The place was completely empty and someone who even came in after us got his order and was gone before we got anything we ordered.    I don't mind waiting for good food but waiting for close to 20 minutes to receive a smoothie seems a little long.  I do like this place but if you are short on time, this is not the place to come, HOWEVER if you have some extra time this place will be worth it."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, great smoothies, and great service! I had the caIi turkey and it was really fresh and filling. I also had the topical smoothie and I'm in love. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just found this place today that took over for the closed Pita Pit. The owner was super friendly. Had the prime rib sandwich which was absolutely delicious. Staff is very accommodating. Will be back soon to try something new! Support our local businesses. Owner said he will have his sign up soon."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are juicy and fluffy with the bread! Delicious and healthy ingredients. I ordered their prime rib steak sandwhich, house made chicken noodle and pina smoothie. Very pleased with them all!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch here o. A road trip. The sandwiches were great and the had gluten free wraps available. The pina colado smoothies was delicious. But the best compliment was the staff was SO friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Great new place that really takes pride in serving good food. Been there 4 times now and each time the meals were really good. The prime rib sandwich is yummy and today i had the chicken caprese salad. First time I've had a chicken salad that had more chicken than salad. Personable staff that remembers you as well.... Very nice."}
{"text":"Really yummy and healthy sandwiches! Lots of choices and great people too! I stopped by within a few weeks of their opening and didn't have their sign up yet.   Support this local spot and the wonderful owners/staff who offered a free drink or chips for my wait, which was no longer than the typical wait at Capriotti's. I will be back soon"}
{"text":"Found this place looking for a vegan option headed back out to Phoenix. So. Glad. I. Stopped. The menu is 2 sided - one for meat eaters and one for vegetarians that can be easily be customized. I ordered the Hot Veg Sandwich without mayo and she immediately asked if I was vegan which was reassuring. I added avocado and Sriracha. My partner sometimes has the dietary considerations of a toddler and wanted a cheese sandwich on a roll with a bit of mayo and lettuce. That's it. (For some reason this is a lot more complicated than people realize - more places mess it up than get it right). The lady taking the order (I believe she's the owner) was super concerned about making it correctly so she made sure to get the details a few times just to be sure. Sandwiches came out a few moments later and were perfect. The Hot Veg is a delicious mix of hot grilled carrots, spinach, olives, mushrooms, and onions with a cool layer of perfectly spicy but not painful giardiniera on a beautiful soft but sturdy hoagie. The cheese sandwich got high marks too (as well as a follow up from the owner to ensure it was made properly with an offer to remake it should anything be wrong). Really fantastic service with an excellent product. Bummed there isn't one in Phoenix but we'll be sure to swing by any time we're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Sweet staff and incredibly passionate about the food. Everything is so flavorful and fresh. This place should be a chain! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Freshest food I've had in a long time. Great customer service! Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly and very affordable lunch spot. Food came out quickly and lots of flavor packed into a small meal.   Will definitely come back one my next trip to Vegas and it is definitely better than all that commercial crap on the strip."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place! The customer service is great and the food is phenomenal. It is one of my favorite places to go eat with the fam because it's so easy having both a meat and meatless menu! It's pretty easy to make most of the vegetarian options vegan as well, which I love!  The broth bowls are amazing too! Exactly what I need when I'm feeling under the weather. We eat here at least once a week and have had most of the menu, everything is awesome! My favorite is probably the kale panini or the spicy quinoa wrap.   My husband even had them cater a few of his work events and they were stellar!"}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times now, so its time for a review. This place is ok, the service is very friendly but unfortunately it does take a while for your order to come up - clearly just not enough staff sometimes. That being said the food is where i think a few things could be improved. Ive had the dagwood and in da club, both use the same turkey that is a little dry. In da Club was a fairly bland version of a club sandwich. The dagwood sandwich is pretty good with the prime rib and the bacon - but it needs some sort of sauce. It comes with a red wine vinegar but its very light and you can barely taste it. The macaroni salad was ok, very tangy but nothing special. The potato salad had good flavor but it was a little watery and the potatoes were cut way too big. The berry blast smoothie is good, fairly standard. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Today was the first time I'd ever been here, after a heads' up from Yelp. OMG. I had the prime rib sandwich and it was DELISH. My friend had the Cali but with ham instead of turkey, and equally impressed. It was a bit more than I usually spend for lunch ($11, vs. $7 or $8.) but worth every penny! Everything was super fresh and made to order. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. I had a Cali turkey sandwich and a Berries-n-Cream smoothie, and it was to die for.  Seriously, best sandwich I've had in a while.   I'll definitely be going back, and I'm bringing my friends.  The servers were super friendly, the place itself was about as clean as it gets, and the prices were reasonable.  5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Food is WONDERFUL!!!!!! I had the prime rib sandwich and it was fantastic! great bread, big serving of the most tender prime rib - I ordered it exactly how I wanted it.  Abigail and Brandon are the most gracious hosts. We will be going back often and telling everyone we know!  Fantastic local business - support the local merchants and keep the money here in our town!  WE LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for food that would cater to my vegetarian diet before heading home after a long weekend in Vegas and they did not disappoint. Everything is fresh and wholesome from the sandwiches to the broth made to order with ingredients of your choosing. Very unique sandwich options for all sandwich lovers! The staff was welcoming and friendly from the minute we stepped inside."}
{"text":"Restaurant is now closed. Sign in the window on 10/15 says \"We will close today at 6pm. Sorry for the inconvenience.\"     Doors locked at 1:30pm and interior is deserted."}
{"text":"I confess, I'm generally quite picky about sandwiches...mostly due to the fact that I make really great ones right at home.   The Good Company Cafe however nails that home style sandwich right on the head. I tried the Portobello Panini and the Misses had the Kale Caprese. Absolutely outstanding and fresh taste of the Kale Caprese and the Panini was so savory. Great helpings of the toppings and truly satisfies.   This place is also good for children as the restaurant lobby is big, they have high chairs and my daughter loved he kids grilled cheese.   Lastly their smoothies are refreshing and plentiful.   I will be coming back here and excited to find a. Ew lunch place not too far from work! A MUST recommendation!"}
{"text":"EAT HERE. Not only do we not have enough local, independent restaurants here in Vegas- but DAMN this place is good! You will not be disappointed. Fresh in flavor and in concept, their menu has sooo many options (and this is coming from a vegetarian/ flexi vegan!!) for people with all types of diets. Plus the whole menu is customizeable! The best part was probably the confidence the owner had in her (!!) craft. When I was deciding between a wrap or a panini, she told me if I didn't like it the wrap, she'd make me a new one. That wasn't necessary- it was DELICIOUS, (the spicy kale& carrot ) but the point was her integrity. Props for that. The food was so quality and yummy, I will definitely be back. I 100% recommend if you want excellent taste, healthy options, and to support our local community."}
{"text":"Very good drove by the place decided to stop by.  It was such a pleasant surprise customer service from everyone was top notch better service then high-end restaurants.Every person that walked in was greeted and people that were regulars were greeted by a first name basis and there was alot of them.Thats was nice to see, I dont know about you guys but I always feel appreciated when I remembered by someone.  The food is great had a kale panini which was delicious they were kind enough to substitute the provolone cheese with white bean spread instead (I am lactose intolerant). Sandwich was delicious.  Also tried there soup very filling and delicious. I plan on making this my regular lunch spot.This place is a very comfortable setting to dine in."}
{"text":"Great good and great service. I tried the prime rib sandwich. It was delicious! The place is hard to find due to the lack of signage but it's worth looking for. It's between Zabbas and Panda Express. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab an amazing sandwich! New place lovely staff, fresh ingridients! Inexpensive too! Also very healthy"}
{"text":"Yelp has done it again! I found a delicious hidden gem in this enormous city of Las Vegas. It's only been open for four months (as of 6/29/17) but I have a good feeling this place will be around for years to come. I was looking for a great smoothie place, but little did I know I would stumble upon a place that also serves delicious sandwiches (Cubano, Italian, Cali-turkey, prime rib, pastrami just to name a few), and mouth watering broth bowls!    The family all got down from the car to see what was inside and decided to all have lunch here, including some friends we were with. Everyone was raving about what a great establishment this place was! We ordered the Cubano, the Cali-Turkey, the Dagwood, along with the Orangesicle, piña colada, and berry blast smoothies! Everything was bomb! I picked at everyone's food because I couldn't eat. I had dental work done recently and all I could do is watch. I said screw it and ordered me a broth bowl with the works (spinach, kale, edamame, black and white beans, carrot, mushroom, onions, red and green peppers and jalapeños), so that I could get all the vitamins from the broth. WOW Tasha, you sure now how to prepare a broth bowl,...... it was amazing!!!!   I can write on and on about this place, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. You need to come check this place out for yourself and try a little bit of everything! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"WOW!!  Great little restaurant with marvelous staff/owners. (I believe the people who were serving customers are the owners. They are great people!)  I had the portabella panini and my husband had their hot veggie sub. Both sandwiches were marvelous. The gentleman who created our meal was solicitous and asked us to let him know if our sandwiches were not perfect. (They were perfect and quite yummy!) I had a sparkling Dansani water (with lime). Hubby had Coke (in a glass bottle).  The menu is fabulous with options! My husband and I are pescatarians and it is difficult to find \"real\" food in this town which is nourishing...but doesn't require a second mortgage to be taken out on your house in order to pay for said food.  When we return (very soon!) we will be trying the veggie broth which can be customized by having them add unique items (various veggies, quinoa, etc.) to the broth.  We have found a new restaurant to enjoy when we are out and about. This place is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I almost drove by this place.  They don't have a sign up on the building yet but they are open. I'm so glad I stopped and went in.  This location used to be Pita Pit and it's right in between Zabas and Panda.    Everything here is fresh!  The bread comes from local bakeries and the meat is sliced fresh daily.   They have so many choices to chose from.  You can build your own sandwich starting from your choice of bread or wrap to your choice of veggies and sauces.    I got a In Da Club on 9 grain bread, today.  They ev3n included a sample of the macaroni salad that they plan on selling in the future.  Super delicious!  I will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a togo sandwich.  Been swing this on yelp. Walk in to a small but nicely lit and open space looking into serving area. Employees are nice and helpful. Being my first time there she explained the menu. Got the Vegas Heat. A chicken sand with a series of peppers. Let me say this tho it has a little heat, the flavor combo was amazing. Sandwich did not make it out the lot"}
{"text":"Great spot for fresh sandwiches. Was really impressed with the Italian. They also have Protein shakes great for after your workouts!!!! Love this place"}
{"text":"So happy to find a yummy place with lots of vegetarian options. There were plenty of meat options too, which kept my husband happy. We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We just found this place on yelp and decided to try it out. Loved it! I'm a vegetarian and while they have a whole menu of carnivore options they also had many vegetarian options. I got the spicy kale wrap and it was delicious. Perfect amount of food and really tasty. I would definitely recommend it to anyone! Service was awesome as well!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! If lived in Vegas, I would definitely be a regular at The Good Company Cafe."}
{"text":"I am kind of in love with this place. Sandwiches are always so fresh and amazing. You really are paying for quality of the ingredients and the time put into the sandwich.   The first time we came in I got the Italian and my husband got the Dagwood. And they both did not disappoint. The bread is fresh and the meat is definitely not lacking. I believe the owner came over and takes to us and just seems so nice and really wants you to have a great experience. They even offer if you don't like it they will remake you something free of charge, but there was no need our sandwiches were amazing.   Today we visited again and switched things up, I got the cali turkey and my husband got the cheese steak. The cali turkey was hands down one of the best sandwiches I've had. They don't skimp on the meat or the avocado. My husband must've love his sandwich because he inhaled it pretty quickly. Again the multigrain bread was Delish and I don't know what the spread was on the sandwich but I wasn't mad about it, it went well with my crunchy bacon and avocado.   Again the nice lady came over and offered the same thing that if we didn't like it or it was wrong they make something new but how could you mess up these delicious sandwiches!   The only sad part is we use to live close by and now it's a 20 minute drive instead of five because I wish we could eat there every day.   I can't wait for our baby to be a little older so we can give her the quality ingredients to chow down on and feel good about what she is eating instead of questionable meats from other places.   People might think it is expensive but I can't express it enough, you finish that sandwich and understand why it was that much. I'd rather spend the extra money and be overjoyed with the experience than go somewhere and get a soggy gross 5 dollar sandwich.   Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Excellent!! It's not easy to find a healthy lunch to go in Las Vegas. This place nails it with only high quality ingredients and careful construction which makes ALL the difference. My usual started with the Spicy Kale Quinoa wrap and then I moved over to the Grilled Wrap with extra veggies. They take the time needed to prepare the ingredients for the best taste (e.g., grilling the veggies and toasting the wrap), therefore if you are getting take out I'd call ahead, usually ready by the time I get there."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food, reasonable prices. The owners are super nice and energetic.  I had a spicy kale and quinoa wrap and my husband had a custom made steak sandwich. Both were delicious.  We will definitely be regulars here."}
