{"text":"Excellent, eclectic breakfast. Great menu for kids. Small and tough to get a table for a large group, but food and staff are excellent."}
{"text":"I love this place and have been coming here religiously since it opened for brunch but something happened this weekend that turned my stomach. I get that this is a family restaurant but the dining room table is not a place to change a diaper. When I brought it up with the staff the excuse was that they didn't have a changing table. Unacceptable excuse. This is unsanitary and, frankly, disrespectful to patrons. The parents and the staff should know better."}
{"text":"Eclectic menu.  Absolutely delicious food (best burger ever!) Wonderful waitress.  Great little patio. There's nothing not to love!"}
{"text":"We met another couple for Sunday brunch. We arrived at 12:45 and were seated immediately. We were offered a pot of coffee right away. So far so good. Our friends arrived at 1pm.  At 1:55, after several people who had come after us had been served we asked if they had put in our order. Apparently. it had been sitting downstairs in the kitchen, forgotten.  I ordered the omelette - which was a mistake. It was dry and tough and seemed to be have flour or starch as a filler. After a couple of bites, and unable to swallow it, I left it. No-one came over to check. My husband's omelette was marginally better - he left 1/2 .  When the waitress took away our plates and saw that I had left my food almost untouched, she asked, \"how was it\"? I told her it was inedible. She took it away and that was it  - no apology and no offer to take it off the bill. The others had pancakes and waffle Benedict which they said were good. They live in the area but said they won't be back. We certainly won't go back there.  Disappointing!  Tip: if you go, don't order the omelette."}
{"text":"Quiet, friendly vibe located in the Upper Beaches neighbourhood.  It's a coffee shop that also serves brunch and pastries and snacks. They also serve ice cold beer and have a fantastic outdoor patio. Very family friendly or good to bring a book or laptop and catch up on some reading/emails.  Definitely a recommended spot if youre ever in the area. Staff are super friendly and helpful as well!  Hope you enjoy your visit as much as I have!"}
{"text":"It was hard to choose what we wanted for dinner--the menu was so appealing--but we both very much enjoyed our meal. It's great to see bone marrow making a comeback. The white anchovy crostini were delicous but tiny, about six bites; the price reflects the complicated execution. The charcuterie plate (in two sizes) was spot on. The thoughtful craft beer offering includes craft cider. This is already a regular spot for young families walking from home, so come a wee bit later if you'd rather not share the cosy space with a bevy of small children."}
{"text":"so happy I found this neighborhood gem. We came for sunday brunch. it's a small place with a cute little side patio. nicely decorated. already liked it the moment I walked in - even more when the waffle bene with house smoked salmon arrived at my table. down right the best brunch I had in a while."}
{"text":"Love this new addition to the neighbourhood! Food is amazing, the bone marrow was to die for. Have been for dinner and then another time for tea with a friend. Always a great vibe. The chocolate bread pudding dessert made with croissants was a thing of beauty!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place for carnivores and folks not watching their weight.   They have solid brunch options for meat eaters with a vegetarian omelette option (no vegan options) (edit: they've added a crispy tofu option). There aren't many options that are not carbs focused. Which is delicious but not great for regulars. Coffee is strong and delicious.   They smoke their own salmon (!) but couldn't tell me if it was farmed or wild. I want to love this place, and they're so.close. to having it all. Okay, who am I fooling? I do love this place. I just wish there was a bit more attention to the details.  The atmosphere is fun and friendly. They have board games, puzzles and such for the littles. When we lived in the hood, it was one of our go to places for mommy and son time after school.   There aren't many seats so expect to wait on the weekends and on holidays like Mother's and Father's Day."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of spending time here both for daytime brunch and dinner/drinks at night and have been blown away by the excellent food and service! Loved the option of sweet or savoury french toast, and definitely want to come back and try more things. Really enjoy the design of the space, and am looking forward to spending time on their patio this summer."}
{"text":"Another east end gem! I took a friend here for a casual birthday brunch and we loved it! Service was friendly and efficient and the food was superb! I never enjoy eggs Benedict but I tasted my friend's order and was jealous that it wasn't my meal! They made it with a beer-based bernaise sauce and I'm still thinking about it days later. I liked the place so much that I booked mother's day brunch for my family this weekend. Can't believe wait!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find for brunch.  Great coffee, service and food.  Cozy spot, perfect for a rainy autumn day"}
{"text":"Very nice ambience, excellent food and friendly laid back service. What more could you want. They have a nice selection of craft beers and unique cocktails. We tried the arugula, pear and pecan salad followed by seared albacore tuna. Both were excellent. The menu is separated into three different sizes of plates making it perfect for sharing, I keep thinking about what to try next."}
{"text":"Delicious food for brunch. But small and packed full of kids. I'm sure that makes the families happy, but adults were definitely outnumbered when I was there. Luckily we had no trouble getting a table, but I imagine it could be a long wait.   Coffee can come in a carafe to share which is an amazing idea. I had the sandwich with pancakes, sausage, eggs and waffles. Amazing! Would come back again but maybe after the kids go to bed."}
{"text":"Delicious and adorable! Really enjoyed brunch here, would love to come back again. The place is gorgeous, very sweet and intimate. Came w a group of girls post 5k run, we were famished. Got seated more quickly than expected! Service was a little uneven, but you can tell that they are trying. Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon was great, as were lattes and juices. I'm pretty judgy about brunch but we all left pleased, very satisfying meal. Will come back to try the French toast!"}
{"text":"Such a great neighbourhood spot .. a true hidden gem. Cozy, comfy, classy, warm.. great beer list and excellent quality food. Have been twice at lunch time and had the pemeal bacon sandwich both times - it was that good. Great spot for little kiddos too (they've got high chairs). Awesome baked goods and coffee as well. Want to check it out for dinner sometime, too."}
{"text":"I've only been to BH for dinner and drinks. The place is fantastic. Excellent cocktails, respectable beer selection, brilliant food, super friendly service, cozy ambiance. Looking forward to going for brunch one of these days, I've heard great things."}
{"text":"Cozy, ambient, hygge, hip. Classy comfort food and a perfectly-balanced lavender gin and tonic. Will return.  Take the 506 eastbound or get off Line 2 at Woodbine and head south."}
{"text":"Bodega Henriette is a small restaurant located in the Upper Beaches neighbourhood (on Gerrard between Coxwell and Woodbine) that can seat around 30. Upon entering, the interior gives a warm welcoming vibe that has a uniqueness to it; the different wallpapers in the restaurant give the place some character and some colour. I recently came to try their brunch with a party of 4 around 12 noon on a Saturday. Although the place was busy, we waited around 15 min for a table.  Upon being seated, service was friendly and attentive and we never felt rushed to leave as we were able to converse in a relaxing environment. Our party had the waffle bennies (one with smoked salmon, one with bacon, and one with arugula and tomato jam) and the peameal sandwich. The smoked salmon and bacon waffle bennies were great but the arugula and tomato jam benny lacked some flavour (as a vegetarian option for brunch). The peameal sandwich was a huge portion with stacks of peameal bacon which was filling.   Overall, a bit further east of the city but a good place with a local community relaxing vibe for brunch."}
{"text":"The place is cozy, the staffs super nice. There are even bored games for you to play with. The brunch menu was simple with a few selections which made it easy for me to decide what to try. I ordered the Waffle Benedict with peameal. It took longer than usual for the meal to arrive but it was worth the wait. I wish the peameal was a bit more well done, but overall everything was really delicous. Would definitely come back."}
