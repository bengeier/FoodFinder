{"text":"Tried the veg thali and saag roti here. Both were delicious but pricey. Will definitely go back to try other items."}
{"text":"First time trying. I love Indian cuisine so I looked to Uber Eats for my area and decided I'm going to try all that's available to me.  Started with New Mirchi Dhaba.  Ordered several dishes and I have to say delicious. Some new some I'm familiar with.  Arrived promptly and steaming hot and very delicious.  I've given it a 3 because I want to check the consistency before giving a better score.  Chicken biryani was loaded with chicken and a very healthy portion indeed. I have enough leftovers for about 4 days of lunches and am very happy about that.  Chana Masala Mutter Paneer Garlic Naan Lamb Vindaloo Chicken Biryani Kadhi Pakora (new to me) Very well priced for everything I got.  Will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Food has the authentic rustic taste of Punjabi cooking! Doesn't matter what dish you eat.  It's not much of an eat-in restaurant but definitely value for money if you're doing a takeout!  Their potato stuffed naans are to die for!"}
{"text":"My God, I love this place. It's a hole in the wall, but the food is so good (everything I've had here tastes just like my Punjabi mom makes) and at such affordable prices.   It's always busy with the students 'cause you just cannot beat that veg thali deal.   Highly recommend trying the chaat paapri if you are ever in the area."}
