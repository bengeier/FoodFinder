{"text":"This place is amazing. The staff is incredibly friendly and treats you like family (although it does get busy during lunch and they get stressed). This is one of the best places for a sandwich in Pittsburgh.

My wife loves the wedding soup (and they sell it frozen for those cold nights at home when you dont want to cook) but you HAVE to try the Italian Club. The sundried tomato vinaigrette (or \"crack sauce\") is amazing and addictive."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review (of the deli only) by saying that I always try to eat local and I really want to like this place...I just can't.  I've eaten there probably 6 times, and 4 of the 6 there was always something wrong.  I will admit, the sandwiches are good, but not worth the hassle.

This past time was the last straw for me.  I came in on a Thursday afternoon a little after lunch.  There was about 6 people behind the counter, yet I was waiting for about a minute for service.  The person that took my order was very nice, but also very new.  I've had a new cashier each time, and it seems like training is lacking.
My order was the Colliseum (half pount of bologna or ham on your choice of bread with toppings).  I ordered ham with lettuce and mayo on regular (square) bread toasted...not too hard.  After about 15 minutes and a lot of apologies, I received my lunch and drove off.  I immediately noticed that I got a hoagie bun...no big deal...bread is bread for the most part.  When I got home I opened up the sandwhich...no lettuce and no mayo. I decided to just go with it until I bit in an realized I was given bologna.  I essentially paid $8 for a plain bologna hoagie.  Last straw

My other order were either always messed up (mostly on the toppings) or took an unreasonable amount of time to prepare, regardless of what hour of the day it was.  As much as I hate to say it, the ownership could do itself a favor by looking at how subway operates and manages to churn out a sandwich every minute.  It seems like everyone is always moving and staying busy, but not a lot gets done...and there is always at least one token person behind the counter who either knows absolutely nothing, knows where nothing is, or is panicking needlessly.

I frequent this area a lot, and will still go to IBP for there frozen and prepared pastas and such, but if you want a good sandwhich that is much more creative and quicker...go across the street to the deli beside PNC."}
{"text":"Bread and meat were very high quality, but the toppings were sub par. I would go here again, just not for the subs."}
{"text":"Not many places to get a decent breakfast sandwiches to go in the area do I decided to stop here for one. Great breakfast sandwich here, no need to look further! Haven't tried anything else but everything looked amazing. Fresh baked bread, top notch deli meat and cheese, homemade pastas and sauces. I fully recommend this place for anyone looking for a deli or fresh baked bread."}
{"text":"How can you call yourself the Italian bread store and serve stale bread.  All the ladies that work there seem to be very very nice but I do not like the food owner must be a real cheapskate they charge you $.75 extra for a small salad dressing when you have already overpaid for the salad"}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches & u gotta try the pumpkin roll when it is in season.  I've never been disappointed with anything I've gotten for lunch!"}
{"text":"So I have been here three or four times now and I keep forgetting to take a picture to add because I eat the food so fast I don't think to give it a review until I'm already done this sandwich is so good. I order the Coliseum on hoagie bun with just ham and provolone it's so good that it makes you want to slap your grandmother. Its got the right blend of bread and meat some places have too much bread I hate that and the bread doesn't cut the roof of your mouth when it's toasted that's a plus. I can't say anything bad about the service sandwich takes about 5 minutes. There are always some homemade cookies or something that you can impulse buy. I like the kind of place you pick your own drink. They have parking out front that's nice sometimes the whole mood is spoiled when I can't park my truck there's a lot of places I want to eat but because of lack of parking I don't go there. now on the deli side I have never used the deli. It looks fantastic though. I think that I would like it but I work such long hours that the food would probably spoil in my refrigerator so I try not to get pounds or half pounds of food me if I wanted to I would go there. If you're looking for a good hoagie or a sandwich this is the place I made sure I went more than once because sometimes a place to keep a good front but eventually they get exposed I give the Italian bread place 5 stars."}
{"text":"I love the food at this place, all of it, the deli meats, bread, sandwiches, pizza dough, everything. It's fantastic. 

My issues are the unfortunately common problems among Pittsburgh small businesses: The hours, and the attitude.

They close too early in the day and start closing about 30 minutes before they lock the doors so its a crap shoot if you'll be able to buy what you want, when you want it.

The service is generally good, but I sometimes get the impression that the staff could care less. They also seem to assume you're as familiar with the menu as they are and can get snippy if you're unprepared to answer questions in exactly the way they expect. 

All said, I'll keep visiting because this is the best deli/ bakery / sandwich joint in the area."}
{"text":"Great little deli with pretty darn good Italian breads, baguettes, hard rolls, fresh pizza dough, etc.
Awesome deli, all kinds of imported cheeses, meats, imported charcuterie, salads, and grated cheeses.

Tons of sweets like biscotti, almonetta, and cannoli.

Family owned and operated!"}
{"text":"Their pepperoni rolls are the best around! We always order the Italian club which is delicious. Today I had the steak hoagie and it was one of the best I've had in a long time. Staff is always pleasant to deal with also"}
{"text":"It took over 25 min to order catering over the phone for 2 days. The lady on the phone kept saying their computer system is very slow and she didn't know how to use it. It was painful. Food quality and prices were good."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and even better service. Customer service was friendly and they got my food out in a timely manner, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great stand alone deli. The service was fast and friendly. Their bread is of course fresh accompanied with quality Boars Head meats and cheeses. You can't order a bad sandwich here but nothing that stands out either.  The prices are good and the portions are adequate. I wouldn't mind a meaty sandwich but honestly I always walk away full. Overall I would recommend if you want a good sub with quality ingredients."}
{"text":"I love the pepperoni rolls and the bread is fantastic. I usually am there for the bread but the cookies they have there are also great.
The one thing that annoys me is there system of ordering. Everytime I ask for meat I am looked at like its a major inconvenience. The womem there always seems like they are over worked or stressed out which I don't care about just give me some fake politeness.
I really like the products. I just go for the breads and get out. 
Also I usually like to get some garlic breads from the freezer. They are always nice to have at home. Don't tell anyone but some times I cook the garlic bread at home and make a hoagie out of it. Lovely!
You can also call you order in ahead of time. I have never done this as I live close but it's probably the way to go.
I give 5 stars if the service was more efficient. The food gets 5 stars though."}
{"text":"Well, it was as good as it gets. Update: Closed. They had a sign on the door that they were losing their lease and moving. That obviously changed, since the new sign says they're closing for good."}
