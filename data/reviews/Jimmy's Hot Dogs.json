{"text":"Really good food. My entire office loves eating here. The perches aren't bad either. Sadly, the service is awful!!! They are lucky they have good food. The delivery girl slugged into our office awhile ago after an hour an half wait complained she's had quite the day an said she just wanted to die. Obviously she didn't really want to die, but how unprofessional. They never answer the phone an I call in almost all my orders. The same girl that delivers is always so rude when I do come in. It all just makes for an un-enjoyable experience, but I go for the food. HIRE NEW STAFF!"}
{"text":"Awesome hot dogs, fries are ...OK small portions but for a smaller price at least, service  was mediocre. Restaurant is very clean though."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just unlucky but I've been three times now and everytime I've gotten stale, hard buns. I think I'm done."}
{"text":"First review ever! Went to Jimmy's Hot Dogs for lunch today. Wow. I got the jumbo dog with the hand-cut fries. The dog was amazing, with a casing that gave it a real crunch. And what else need I  say except 'fresh, hand-cut fries' This is definitely a new lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my chili dog! Considering I am pregnant, so I do not like all foods right now, but that was very tasty. The only issue I had was my fries were very over-cooked, but I would try it again. :) I found them on GrubHub, the first time I have used this website, I like that option. I ordered delivery, it took about an hour."}
{"text":"Exactly the kind of chili cheese fries I was craving, especially if you ask for all hot dog toppings. At first I was afraid it was going to be too small, but it was perfect for me. Anymore and I'd probably have a heart attack from all the gooey, delicious cheese fat. I give it 4 stars because they don't have any vegetarian options. I so wish they had vegetarian chili!"}
{"text":"I moved here from Chicago anout 6 months ago.I miss my Chicago hot dog joints, then I came across Jimmy's Hot Dogs, Love the food,  love the employees, it takes me back to a familiar taste. My favorite menu item is the meatball w hot Chicago style giardiniera and crispy fresh-cut, right in front of you fries. Exceptional food, exceptional service. You cant go wrong at Jimmy's.

Alan from Chicago"}
{"text":"At first I was scared to get a hot dog for delivery but the delivery lady was very polite and my food. Where do I start?
My chili cheese dog was AMAZING.  And the fries not crispy but were very delicious. And serving a strawberry crush soda in a bottle. Heaven has served me well. And the cheesecake. Oh bou, delicious. Good Job Jimmys Hot Dogs. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Jimmy's is the best place to go for a good quick lunch I always get Italian beef sweet peppers hot peppers with mozzarella and wet so amazing could eat it, the staff there is very friendly always working hard has a smile on their face and I get my food quick as possible Jimmy's is my go-to thanks for the great food. Great dogs, great prices. Prepare to smell like french fries."}
{"text":"I have always looked at hot dogs mounded with toppings as a distraction from the normal hot dog experience.  Even the first few times I went to Jimmy's, I would only get the regular dog.  The regular dog is great, but when I tried the loaded dog (Chicago style I think it is called) I was amazed.  Very tasty and it really does not take away from the great dog that is inside.  The fries are slightly greasy but I do not think that is a bad thing really.

I have not tried anything else on their menu yet, but will update when I do."}
{"text":"Great customer service!! Amazing food. I ordered chili cheese fries and the Chicago style hot dog. Good was fresh and fast! I would absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"Great hot dog stand, except it's not a stand, it's an order first, then sit down and eat restaurant.  The grill is right behind the counter and busy, busy.  My food order showed up very quickly.  

Hot dogs were decent.  I'll eat there again, fo sho."}
{"text":"The hot dogs have a nice snap to them, so you know they are good.  Not totally Chicago authentic, but there are not many other better places in the area.  It is a nice, clean hole in the wall place with good food and good fries.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Welp, ate there today and they do have poppy seed buns...very good. Best Chicago style dog I've had in AZ so far.

The slice their own potatoes for the fries - that's rare.

Parking can be a little bit of an issue at lunchtime though.

And, you can't beat the price either."}
{"text":"Finishing a week vacationing in Arizona. Came to Jimmy's  for lunch and ordered a chili dog but substituted a bratwurst for the hot dog and a hot dog bun for the French roll  Added cheese and onion. Restaurant is very clean and help is friendly but food is mediocre. We really have very little hot dog wise in Tacoma, WA where I come from. What little we have is certainly better than Jimmy's Hot Dogs based on my meal. The food was well-prepared but seemed of mediocre taste. Both the bratwurst and the chili were so bland. No napkins on the table. They do have a wide variety of hot dogs which, of course,  I did not try. They had a small cooler with a variety of soft drinks as well as  a fountain machine .  Out of  probably  30 selections their only diet choice was Diet Coke . I guess they don't have sugar sensitive customers. If I were local I don't think I would be back"}
{"text":"Outside of Chicago, this was the best hot dog I've ever had.  I can't speak of the restaurant because this order was delivered, but it was delivered in a timely manner!

I ordered a hot dog (comes with french fries) with a pickle, relish, ranch dressing, parmesan cheese and tomato.  The combination of flavors might sound odd, but it was everything I hoped it would be.  The ranch and the relish juice combined to create this sort of pastel green ooze dripping out the back of the bun, which I thought was really cool but my table mates thought was a bit odd.  The sesame bun was no match to such a full hot dog, but it was much better than a typical, cheap hot dog bun.  

The fries were meh, a little soft a brown for my taste.  The chili dogs looked pretty good too, but make sure you ask for cheese if you expect to get some.

If you're getting a delivery or to-go order, I highly recommend you request the dogs in a box rather than wrapped up, especially if you get a lot of toppings.  It can get a little messy!"}
{"text":"Got a jumbo dog and fries with a Coke for lunch. Fabulous dog. You cannot go wrong here.

My associate always get a brat. Must be good, too.

I will return.

{"text":"Great place for lunch! I love the fresh cut fries! Their service is fast and the place is clean. The food matches what you'd expect. Prices are fair and their menu is impressively diverse. Been here a few times. Will be here again."}
{"text":"Always good! I've been here so many times I cant count.. obviously their doing something right! The place is super cheap, great food (fresh cut fries literally done in front of you), super fast service, and the people behind the counter are always in a good mood... like always. Love this place, if you get a chance eat here... you'll thank me later"}
{"text":"What can I say but AWESOME???? This little shop is cranking out solid dogs and fries in short order! Like a well oiled machine, my $$3.35 gets me a fully loaded Chicago dog with fries that are fresh cut right into the fryer basket!! UNREAL!! Great dog with the right amount of snap, nice steamed bun and perfectly cooked crispy fries!  I can't say enough how great this place is but get there early, there's often a line out the door."}
{"text":"This place is friggin awesome.  Only bad part is you'll get fat if you eat here everyday."}
{"text":"This place serves up a mean little Chicago Dog! These wieners really have flavor! I wish the tomatoes were a little fresher but it wasn't offensive by any means. My Chicago came with fries all for the small price of $3 bucks, I can respect a place that doesn't humiliate my Washington's. The fries were freshly cut and fried, I wish they were a little more crunchier but hey I'm used to preservative laden potatoes so I guess I can't comment much on fresh fries (think In-N-Out fries but slightly larger). I can't wait to come back to try the Chili Dogs and Brats!"}
{"text":"Went here this weekend and it's not bad, pretty decent. There was nothing that stuck out that blew my mind away just another normal hot dog joint that sells good hot dogs/chili dogs and fries."}
{"text":"Good dog, quick service, friendly staff. Not blown away, but good ewould eat here again if I was around during lunch."}
{"text":"Burning your mouth hot, fresh fries and great jumbo dog!"}
{"text":"Best Chicago dog in town.  The prices are unbeatable.  I love their fries as well.  The double dog is very interesting and fun to eat if you like getting messy.  I like the Chicago dog so much, I haven't tried many other variants, except the chili cheese dog...amazing!  They deliver also, even early in the morning, so no matter when you're craving hot dogs, you can call in your order and pick it up, or have them deliver!  They have, I think either weekly or monthly special dogs that they don't always offer.  My favorite special is the jumbo dog.  It's a Chicago dog with a super jumbo Vienna dog.  All the employees are friendly, each table has a bottle of malt vinegar, salt and ketchup (if you're weird enough to put ketchup on ANYTHING).  I would vote to abolish the ketchup altogether, but I'll let them keep it for the little kids and strange adults who still eat ketchup.  Finally, the most important thing I appreciate about this place is the consistency.  You get the same dog and fries every time, there is no fluctuation in quality.  It's great every time and I've been there at least two dozen times."}
{"text":"While visiting Arizona I called upon the local Yelper population to assist me in finding hot dog joints to visit and eventually review. One of the places suggested was \"Jimmy's Hot Dogs\" which serves Chicago style hot dogs and within a few days I had made my way there. I pulled up to a non-descript looking building and sure enough Jimmy's was there with Vienna Beef umbrella's out and visible. 

I walked in and decided to go for a hot dog and fries. I took a few pictures of the place on the inside and headed back to the table to actually sample the hot dog here. I ordered a hot dog with everything, fries and a cup of water. A few minutes later my order was up and it was time to try it.

The bun here was a classic poppy seed bun as often found on Chicago style hot dogs. The bun was mostly soft with a few of the edges being a bit dry. The relish was of the neon green variety and was applied a little too heavily. The onion was chopped and applied nicely to the dog. The mustard was well applied as well, two thin slices of tomato were at the bottom. A thin pickle slice at the top and a pair of sport peppers were on the dog as well. The sausage used here was the classic Vienna beef natural casing and was properly heated up. The overall taste of the dog was excellent. The bun on the edges was a little more dry than I would prefer and the relish was applied a bit too excessively, but overall this tasted excellent and is a great representation of a Chicago style hot dog for people in Phoenix to try.

The fries wrapped with the hot dog were \"fresh cut fries\". Over the past decade or so these have become extremely popular with hot dog vendors in Chicago. The good news is these taste like authentic Chicago style fresh cut fries, the bad news is as in Chicagoland, these are usually hit or miss and these were about average for ones found around Chicago. They weren't too greasy but they were a bit on the bland side. I didn't finish off the fries, but I will say these were a lot like what many places in Chicago serve.

Overall for a Chicago-Style restaurant 1500 miles away, Jimmy's Hot Dogs easily exceeded my expectations. I'd highly recommend this place if you want a good example of what a Chicago style hot dog should taste like in Arizona. I tried several other places (with more reviews coming) that were serving alleged Chicago style dogs while in Arizona, and none compared to Jimmy's. I am going to give this place a full five star review."}
{"text":"Simply put...nicely prepared Vienna Beef hot dog Chicago style.  Loved it plus the french fries.  The staff working there today were very nice and friendly.  Seemed like they enjoyed their job.  Flying back home today after a week in Phoenix for business.  Glad I found this great place on Yelp.  Nice place to detour to on your way to the airport car rental center."}
{"text":"My new top pick for a quick lunch.  It's great having these guys right across the street from my office.  Great dogs and amazing fries.  Check Em out!"}
{"text":"Real deal Vienna beef Chicago dogs in Arizona. Only thing missing is the poppy seed bun but totally forgivable, they nailed everything else. Dog had a great casing, was perfectly steamed & tasty. Cheap and delicious!"}
{"text":"Pretty good hot dog stand, the place is always nice and clean and the staff is friendly.  I was glad to see pizza puffs on the menu. The dogs are pretty good, the only thing I'd change is the buns usually aren't steamed enough for my taste, the fries are excellent, and there's usually a special that changes from time to time. I'd like to see them expand their hours and include Saturday or at least stay open later than 5pm. All in all this is a very solid place."}
{"text":"Had to check out Jimmy's since I was in the area picking up some parts for a work project. It is located in a small business center just off the corner of 40th St and Broadway.

They have your standard Chicago favorites with a small seating area inside and additional seating on the patio. Everyone says to get there early to avoid the crowd. This place is definitely very popular for the people working around here. I think the convenience factor plays a big part.

Got here before the lunch rush and ordered the standard Chicago Dog and a Chili Cheese Dog. Decided to go crazy and also order some Chili Cheese Fries on the side. Service was rather quick and friendly. Could not resist watching some TV while I waited for my meal. Put me into nice zombie state until my food arrived.

Not sure what happened but both dogs seemed to be well overcooked and the buns were both tough and a bit stale. The chili cheese fries seemed to lack any type of wow factor as well. I even tried putting some hot sauce on them to kick things up a notch. Oh well.

Overall they have a nice menu with prices that are reasonable. Maybe the trick is to go when they are extremely busy to get the freshest stuff. But then again who has time to stand in line. Give them a try and see what you think. Not the best and not the worst in my books.  SOLID A-OK

3 STARS"}
{"text":"Great place, great service, great food. I really like the sausage and peppers sandwich. Reminds me of back east. The bread here is good too which typically is hard to find out west. The place is very reasonable and you can get a solid lunch for less than $10.00. Jimmy has done a great job of bringing a taste of Chicago to the Phoenix market."}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating at Jimmy's hot dogs, for hearing such good things & reading the reviews I was slightly disappointed. I wanted something quick & easy for lunch. It wasn't busy & service was fairly fast, I guess that's the benefit of having a later lunch hour. Customer service was ok, I mentioned it was my first time in and that I'd heard good things about their dogs. I ordered the fire dog(not spicy) which was told it's generally served Chicago style, I was asked what toppings I wanted, to my misunderstanding thought she meant additional to the Chicago style toppings. My dog which I'd ordered to go,  to my surprise only had what I thought were my additional toppings of spicy mustard & good bundle of jalapenos on it. It was a tasty dog & came with fabulous fresh hot fries for a reasonable price, I'll definitely try it again, it's close and good cheap eats."}
{"text":"My new go-to lunch or snack place when I'm at work in the Cotton Center area. Good honest Chicago-style hotdogs (using Vienna Beef) with the traditional toppings: mustard, onion, relish, pickle, tomato, sport peppers, and celery salt -although you can tailor the toppings to your liking. Basic hotdog sandwich for $2.95, double dog for $3.95, pepper 'n egg sandwich $3.95, Italian beef $5.95; and all sandwiches include fries. A tasty meal, a great deal!"}
{"text":"I drive by all of the time and finally went to try out jimmy's. I am disappointed that it took me this long. The food was awesome. I found out that they make the meatballs daily for the subs and that they have a double dog (2 dogs in one bun). I decided on the Italian beef with sweet peppers and loved it. The place is small and it seemed like the AC wasn't working, but it was 107 outside. The food more than made up for it. I will be back!"}
{"text":"A co-worker mentioned she was craving hot dogs - because I had taken her for really good ones the week before. Unfortunately, we were limited on time, and the really good ones were too far. I pass Jimmy's every day on my way to work and it's close to the office, so we decided to check it out
.
A few Yelp friends I trust have given great reviews - so why not?
Sigh. What a difference a few years can make.

I was really hungry, so I did power through my brat. After the first bite, I mentioned that my first impression was not bad, but it's not as good as the other place. It will go in a pinch. By my last bite, I told my coworker if she ever wanted to go back, she could do it without me.

The mozzarella sticks were the cheap frozen kind, with the thick crappy breading and the chemical aftertaste. My brat was gray and tasteless. Gray. And served on French bread. Cheap commercial French bread. You know, the kind with no crunch in the crust. Rubbery. My coworker said generic grocery store hot dogs have more flavor than hers did.

I can only assume they changed their product line in the last few years. I will take for granted they were good when my friends were there, and attempts at cost cutting have destroyed the product quality. Otherwise, I would have to assume my trusted friends have terrible taste in hot dogs, and reconsider how much I can trust their dining opinions.

The safest bet will be to keep the friends, and skip Jimmy's from here on out."}
{"text":"Delicious! Fast (when there isn't a 12 person line!) and great priced. Must eat for a good dog."}
{"text":"I had to add a review after reading that Portillo's uses frozen crinkle french fries.  Jimmys uses a whole potato and slices it right in front of you - nothing frozen.  Jimmys is great."}
{"text":"I eat here about once a week as they are one of few places that will deliver to my office.  They usually accept online orders through GrubHub, but some days you have to call in to place a delivery order.

First, I love the service.  My delivery gal is always friendly and smiling when she brings my lunch.  They can be busy during the lunch rush so if you have to call in, be patient.  

As for the food, I don't really know what to say.  It's an all-around good hot dog.  The poppy seed bun is soft and fresh.  (But the last couple orders I got a regular bun...not bad, but not the yummy poppy seed bun I was expecting.)  You have your choice of toppings, and I've never had them get my order wrong.  Their chili is pretty good too - try a chili cheese dog one day!  

The french fries are worth going for by themselves.  I love the fresh-cut flavor that doesn't even need salt. (But really, who eats french fries without salt anyway?)  The onion rings are consistently good, and not too greasy.  Get a side of ranch for dipping.  The fries will be even better!

The pizza puff was a little weird the one day I tried it.  It was like a pizza version of a toaster strudel, or a giant Totino's pizza roll.  Like I said, it was weird, but it tasted like pizza.

Give this place a try, and then keep coming back.  The price can't be beat for the quality."}
{"text":"Though the food deserved 5 stars. The attitude from one of the girls working there deserves only 1. I totally get it that lunch time will be busy, but when I went to check the status of my order, the younger girl brought out my food, and then put it down and walked away with noticeable attitude, and without ever acknowledging the long wait time, let alone saying thanks."}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch.  Love that it was so near home!

The service was not the friendliest.  I didn't feel welcome.

The chili cheese dog - Loved the hot dog, Loved the bun.  Didn't care for the taste of the chili.  Looking forward to trying a plain hot dog next time.

The Italian Beef Sandwich - good.  I would get it without the provolone next time.

The fries - okay.  I think they would be better double fried.  Liked that they had malt vinegar to put on them.

The onion rings - good"}
{"text":"I have to be very pleased or very upset to write a review. This review is totally deserved. Clean place, staff with smiles, and great food!


I will continue to come here"}
{"text":"Great hot dog joint! Gotta try the brats or Italian sausage as well - love the fries!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy!! I love how EVERYTHING is fresh made. Ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich and it was delicious! Place is small so seating may be very limited for large parties. I believe maximum occupants is 29. However, don't let that stop you, it's well worth it. In fact, the only negative thing I could say is that they don't have regular unsweetened tea..."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place, so I figured I should try it out. They had hot dogs, sausages, chicken sandwiches, ect... I ordered the spicy Italian sausage with tomatoes and pickles and I must say it was delicious! I really liked the bun was different but different good. My cousin had the chili cheese dog and he said that was delicious, he devoured that within a few minutes. I highly recommend this place and I'll be a returning customer for sure."}
{"text":"Great F@#$ing Dawgs!!!  The fries are insane!!!  The ONLY way to make this meal better is Duck Fat!   Give this place a shot......like every other day...its that good.  My Boyee Kyle L. is an insane server/employee and he makes wicked dawgs!!"}
{"text":"Jimmy's food is great with awesome prices. The Hot Dog includes crisp hand cut fries and is only $3.35 plus tax. A good mix of menu items make this an ideal local business lunch spot. Come in a bit later to avoid the moon crush."}
{"text":"Great hot dog along with good prices makes this place a winner. Great home cut fries. Try the chile cheese dog and fries, comes with drink for around $5.50, yum! 
This place is really friendly and I like that the cashier always asks how your day is going. I always reply \"It's going great now that I am at Jimmy's\""}
{"text":"I found this place through yelp. Great hole in the wall with excellent fresh fries to go with a modest sized chili cheese dog. Best lunch for under $10 even with a tip."}
{"text":"This place is great! moderately priced and great dogs! fries too! I work a few minutes away, its quick clean and the food is definitely filling. Bread they use is great and so are the sausages. Also fries are freshly cut everyday, in front of you while you order."}
{"text":"Had the special Sonoran Dog, fries and drink. The dog was great, the bun was great and fries some of the best I've had. And all at a very reasonable price. I will make the drive from Ahwatukee to eat here again."}
{"text":"Great service. Best hot dog I've ever had. I'm from Chicago. Great prices. Small place but nice. Fries are out of this world good. Great menu. I'm looking forward to trying different stuff there."}
{"text":"I have ordered from Jimmy' many times (Hot Dogs) and have always been satisfied.  Today was a complete disappointment.  I asked if fries came with the Sausage sandwich, gal replied no.  Isaid okay then I will have the meatball sub (since the online menu here on Yelp shows that sandwich comes with fries).  Then she asked if I wanted cheese?  For an extra charge?  Ok yes.  Pay $8.27 (plus $2 tip!).  Delivery arrives, no fries.   I call same Gal explain I didn't get my fries, she says meatball sub doesn't come with fries.  I remind her of our earlier convo, she says that is why we always ask if you want fries.  I tell her the menu shows fries with meatball sub, she says No we changed menu about 4 weeks ago, everything is ala carte now. I again tell her there is no cheese on this sandwich, next thing I am talking to a man, did not say hold on, let me transfer you nothing.  Sandwich so not worth $8.00!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best French Fries I have had in Phoenix. Have visited Jimmie's several times, so it wasn't just a fluke. They are fresh with great outside crunch and wonderful inside. I am a purest so a little black pepper and malt vinegar - NIRVANA!

I just wish their Hot Dogs were of better quality and with more taste. A brand like Boars Head Natural Casing, Sabrett Natural Casing, Nathans Natural Casing or Hebrew National Natural Casing instead of Vienna Brand, which I find too bland, and they could increase their prices. Load the Hot Dog up with toppings and you'll survive, as the Fries make it all worthwhile!

French Fries - 5 STARS

Hot Dog - 3 STARS"}
{"text":"These are the best Chicago style dogs in town. The Italian beef is great as well."}
{"text":"It's been almost 2 years since I 1st stumbled upon Jimmy's and the 1st time I was just going along for the ride, and now Jimmy's is what I think of when I want a hot dog!  I am thrilled to see that Jimmy's is still doing great! 

They still have the freshest fries for a fast food joint, you literally watch the whole peeled potato get cut into perfectly proportion fries and placed in the fryer basket and watch them bad boys get fried! And you know what else makes these fries pretty sweet, they still are free, you are only pay for the price of the dog, and yes I bet are saying now oh but a 6 buck dog is paying for your fries, but here at Jimmy's you can get a dog for like 3.50, killer deal right there!

Ever since I tried the Chicago dog at Jimmy's almost 2 years ago, that's all I crave, a Chicago styled dog, the tomatoes, the diced green peppers & onions, the peppers & the hot dog on this great bun!  So damn good!   If you haven't been to Jimmy's you should stop by, this place is more than just hype, its great hot dogs excellent fries at an awesome price!"}
{"text":"To start off the cheese fries are awesome.
The hotdogs hit the spot but the down side is the buns aren't steamed and the dogs a bit chewy.
The fries aren't to great but yes they are great with the cheese. The owner is pretty nice guy.
Still pretty good place and even though I dont live near here it's something to drive for."}
{"text":"I was recommended to this place a few years ago and I'm glad because everything I've had here is pretty good. The staff is really on point with their customer service. Fries are good and my favorite to get is always the double dog with chili and cheese!"}

The sausage/hotdog was like chewing a rubber, so hard and not tasty, I took it out and ate the bun with the fries which are real good. But it was really sad because I was really excited (and hungry). Maybe it was the bad dog of the day.

Anyway, also the staff ladys look so rushed/tired/overwhelmed, the cashier needs to take the phone orders, counter and clean table, you might want to hire more people. 

I had a overall sad experience because I had high hopes!"}

I ordered a Chicago style hot dog and fries over the phone and was told that I can pick up in 5-6 minutes.  I get there within time advised and waited a few more minutes for my meal (no big deal). I work 3 minutes away from restaurant- so my food should have been hot or warm. Welp! My hot dog was cold and the bread was hard, but the French fries were very good, Hot and fresh cut.  I was disappointed but also hungry- next time I would like to get a \"hot\" Hot dog please !"}

My husband and I went at noon, madness! So many people! Even though the line was literally out the door, our order was taken w/ in about 7 mins. Cheap, cheap, cheap, CHEAP prices. And for the quality? Its a steal. We found a seat through the rotating crowd and had our food w/ in about 10 mins.

The fries were ok, but the dogs were GOOD. Definitely a great little lunch spot. Dont try and visit on the weekends though, theyre only open M-F."}

{"text":"I saw this place as I was driving down Broadway a few weeks ago and wanted to give it a try. last week I was able to for the first time and have been back twice more since! I love Hot dogs and sausage but there is not a place like that near by my work. This place is good because the dogs are already made. You can get in get your stuff and be done quickly. 

The food was very tasty. I always get the itiallian sausage but I also tried a chicago dog as well and I loved that. The fries are sliced fresh there and they come with every order. If you like hotdogs and needs a place like that for lunch check it out. 

This place is very clean and it smells good. If you work at University of Phoenix it is easy to get there and back wiith in 15 min. They are brand new and I want them to stay!"}

My go-to is the Italian combo with a spicy sausage, sweet peppers, and mozzarella cheese. Not for a light appetite, but you will not be disappointed. Was a weekly regular for awhile and the staff is friendly and knew the grubhub/phone order was mine as soon as I walked in the door."}

Anyways, I was really disappointed. The tamale boat I am sure was frozen. Maybe frozen, defrosted in the microwave and then maybe reheated up. I am not sure but it was almost disgusting with zero sabor to my taste buds."}
{"text":"The freshest fries straight from the potato to the frier. The dogs have that oh-so-delicious snap to them that Chicagoans like myself love. Super crispy onion rings and cheap prices. I haven't had anything here that I didn't love and come back for. It's quick, it's easy, it's cheap and everyone is very friendly."}
{"text":"Simple food for people that enjoy simple things in life like a chili dog. Everything I tried was tasty and I want to go back to try more. The service was friendly. I went for lunch and it is a small place but there seems to be enough seating for everybody."}
{"text":"How have I not been here before?  After 10 years down the road, I finally checked it out.  What a treat.  Great food!  Try the double chicago dog and get some fresh cut fries!"}
{"text":"I was a  first timer I passed this place a few times decided to go ahead and finally try them got there a little bit before the lunch-hour crowd went with the Chicago-style dog I enjoyed it would come again when I'm in the area even though it was not the best Chicago dog I've had it was still real tasty next time I will go with the jumbo dog instead can't beat the price and the staff are real cool"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to eat lunch here today for the first time. We were warmly greeted by a young woman behind the counter. I ordered the hot dog and she asked me if I wanted everything on it which included chopped onions, peppers, pickles, and mustard. My husband ordered the chili dog. The hot dogs both came with a side of homemade French fries. Our total cost was about $8. We placed our order to go so we could eat at a nearby park. It is a small restaurant but very cute and all of the tables were kept clean despite the amount of customers passing through. When our order was ready a man brought our food out to us. My husband asked if they had any to-go ketchup and he said it was already in the bag with some napkins for us. I have worked in restaurants in the past and was very impressed by how professional and friendly the entire staff appeared to be. When we arrived at the park we began to chow down and were both satisfied. We both loved the food and plan on making this a regular lunch stop for ourselves in the future. Good work Jimmy's Hot Dogs!"}
{"text":"A double Vienna beef dog with all the fixings and fresh hand cut fries for $4.35, how can you go wrong?  You can't beat their prices or the food quality and they have a great menu that makes me think I am in Chicago.  I do get my order to go since the fryer smell will linger with you throughout the day but always worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Wow, that was unexpectedly good!  I had the Chicago Dog (I don't remember, they may just call it an original hot dog) with everything and the free fries that come with it.  Ok, fine... you caught me, I'm lying... I had TWO Chicago Dogs.  

Sometimes at places trying to replicate a good Chicago-style hot dog, I have experienced less than stellar results... things like soggy buns that fall apart or relish that is too sweet.  But here at Jimmy's, the bun was PERFECT and the the toppings were just as they should be!

Oh, and the fries?  Ummm, UH-MAZ-BALLS!  Normally I'm not much of a fry guy, but here I let out my gluttonous fry side and gobbled up all dem fries!!

I will DEFINITELY be back -- hurrah hurrah to Jimmy's for getting this Chicago classic just right!!"}
{"text":"I feel the need to give this place a review.  I go here about once a week for lunch, for the past year.  Great Italian beef!  I usually get that, with the fresh-cut on-the-spot fries and a drink and it's like 9 bucks.  Get it with provolone and hot peppers.  I haven't tried their dogs, but they look good and lots of folks order them.  Eat at Jimmy's and make your mouth happy!"}
{"text":"Great dogs, it's always clean but it can get packed during the lunch hour crowd and it's a very small place so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Everything I had had chili on it.  This is good grub, not fancy, and very nice staff.  My diet is ruined."}
{"text":"I am originally from the Midwest and Love a good Chicago style dog.  Vienna beef, onions, tomato, neon relish, sport peppers, pickle and poppy seed bun.  
I have driven past this place several times over the past few years and finally decided to try.  Clean restaurant, easy menu, fresh cut fries and good prices.  The hot dog was delish!  I did not give a full 5 starts because I did not get mustard or a pickle on my dog, which is disappointing.  Other than that, the was good.  I will be revisiting and hopefully I get the missing ingredients!"}
{"text":"Don't let the lack of reviews get you down like it did me.  My coworker suggested this place and we were not disappointed.  Great servings, good prices.  Nice staff.  It was a lunch crowd so they could have been a little more efficient at the register, but it was worth the wait.  Don't let the \"Hot Dog\" detract you- this isn't ballpark or Quiktrip dogs- and it isn't Wonder Bread.  Definately in our rotation now"}
{"text":"Well, you guys did it.  

My work switched buildings on me so now I am in this area.  Had to scout out new places to go for lunch and found this place.  See, I go to lunch with my buddy from work who was born/raised in Chicago and bitches and whines if something isn't truly \"authentic\" and sure, he has his list of things that aren't but this place still rocks like the band Whitesnake in the 80's.  He has signed off on this place as being well above exceptional.

On a budget, this place takes care of you.  Hell, for good food this places takes care of you.  Usually, I go for the double dog (which comes with an order of fries which I believe they double fry.  Apparently this is a Chicago thing but I don't know what the hell that means.  All I know is they are crispy)

Typically I always get a hotdog of some sort and like a Schwarzenegger movie, it doesn't disappoint.  Had the meatball sub once to be different once and was all right.  Not bad, but all right.  Will stick to the hot dogs.

Seems like I find myself here at least once a week, with the all to familiar conversation of \"where do you want to eat?\" and this is always our fallback spot.

Other awesome pros I would like to add:
-They leave the tv remote out on the table.  Got to piss off other people by watching a  \"Saved by the Bell\" a few weeks ago.  It was the dramatic episode where Jesse Spano was hooked on the pep pills so she could slam dunk the piss out of her test scores.
-Girl who works the counter 100% of the time always asks \"So how is your day going?\"
-Prices.  Very reasonable.  Thank you - (signed all underpaid corporate workers)
-Typically clean tables, especially for the amount of customers who come in and out of here.  Seems more people have come in and out of here then they have inside of Paris Hilton.

One suggestion:
a-la-catre (am I spelling that right?) for a hot dog without the fries.  Just a suggestion."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch today, I had the polish dog and it was very good. The fries were delicious too, I will go back to try some of their other sausages and hot dogs. I went around 2:00 pm and there was no line, food was out quick, and very hot. I would recommend to anyone who likes sausages and hot dogs."}
