{"text":"Ordered two sheet pizzas for my sons first bday party both were almost totally sauceless and cheese less the meat that was extra was sparse. They were soggy and extremely greasey and totally tasteless. Ive ordered here for parties in the past and always recommend this place. I will never do either of those things again. Plus they gave me a hard time about using my yelp coupon. Super not happy!"}
