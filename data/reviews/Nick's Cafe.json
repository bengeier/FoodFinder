{"text":"I'm not sure how I miss reviewing this place! They have the best beef stroganoff! The beef is so tender and the noodles are so buttery. It just melts in your mouth!  :) It is only served on Mondays! The service is always great and the staff and owner is very welcoming and inviting. Their breakfast here is also pretty decent."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts in town. I ate a lot of lunch here too. If you like Greek Diners this is a great one to try. At the bottom of the fairview building. I like the pepper steak over rice for lunch and the corned beef hash and grits for breakfast. I know, I know, but trust me it's great. Patronizing this place since 2004."}
{"text":"Nick's Cafe is a really great place for breakfast or lunch. I love the vegetables. They have different specials each day. Service is excellent. I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"You know, Nick's is one of those sleeper restaurants that always comes in handy in a pinch. You may not be in the market for a 3, 4, or 5-star meal, but it's always there. Warm plates of comforts foods, friendly service, tons of regulars, and the same decor for the past 20 years, most likely. 

Located in one of the office buildings, this spot is your typical \"Meat and 3\" type of joint. I'm pretty standard with the marinated chicken over rice, greens, and usually another veg. Is it amazing? No, but it's just right. Kind of like something you'd had for a family gathering that has plenty of love put into it. Always filling and affordable, too. As a sidenote, I've had the vegetable soup a few times and it is truly incredible. You typically don't think much of it in other cases, but do yourself a favor and try Nick's. Truly delectable. 

It's the typical cafe where you pay at the counter. Some old candy rests within the glass case that hasn't been touched for year and a cool old cash register rest atop. This is the kind of place that brings back memories of diners I would go to as a kid with  my grandparents. Old cushy seats, patterned carpet, and odd, hotel-esque art on the walls. Ha! In a sense, it's perfect. Viva, Nick's!"}
{"text":"I always drove by this place and told myself I had to try it out and then promptly forgot all about it as it is hidden in the middle of office buildings, but I'm glad I finally had a chance to dine in! I was very pleased with the home cooked feel of the food and friendly service. 
I got the house special- grilled shrimp and chicken over rice with two sides. I chose the buttered squash, which was really delicious, and the cole slaw, which is mayo based and finely chopped. The entree was amazing~ with loads of grilled veggies (onion, bell pepper, mushroom, tomato) and also came with a complimentary cornbread muffin. Great place for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, Awesome food, Awesome prices!  My new little cafe spot in South Park that doesn't feel like stuffy SouthPark."}
{"text":"Obviously a local spot, you won't know about this one unless you know someone who does. This is a diner style setting and if it has been around long enough based on reputation there is probably a lot more on the menu to try. I went with the classic burger, cole slaw, fries and  a side of Okra. Food is up to par but nothing to brag about. I'd go again if it was convenient or friends were going. You're going to pay $8-$15 for a lunch.

Finding this will be tricky, keep on fairview until you see a business listing sign that has nicks cafe listed on it, you can view it from the street."}
{"text":"Not the fastest way to grab lunch, but the specials are good. You get cornbread or a roll with your meal. The chicken & dumplings are good as is the Grecian Chicken. They aren't open for dinner, but if you're in the area you might stop in for lunch."}
{"text":"Good breakfast. Items have gotten a little pricey need to serve a free drink with specials like others do. 
 Specials should be just that special. 
Family atmosphere waitress service excellent. 
 Very clean and well kept up. Lobby area is modern and bathrooms are a tad too far down the hallway."}
{"text":"I decided to stop by for lunch because it's close to the house and I read such great reviews. The service here is really great. They have a lot of friendly servers who seem to know the regulars by name. This place is no frills. And I don't mind that. But the food was just mediocre. It was like cafeteria food. And $20 for two people for lunch? I feel like I can get more bang for my buck somewhere like jasmine grill."}
