{"text":"Very good Pacific Mexican food! I had the shrimp ceviche, and a fish taco. Both were very good. 

The shrimp ceviche was on a torte/flat taco, but was served with a large amount of the lime/lemon juice used in the ceviche. This was a little unsettling, and added just a little too much acid flavor to the dish. ***

The fish taco was great! Well prepared, and served hot. They had great beans as well, and seemed to serve avocado with every meal. Really delicious stuff. *****"}
{"text":"Food is amazing!! Only down fall is there old men checking you out every way you look lol"}
{"text":"I will never go back here! the food was bland and not to mention the costumer service was terrible. I had to ask them to give me a refill. Go to altata,that place is the best for seafood in the valley."}
{"text":"My coworker brought me here for lunch. I had the shrimp and fish ceviche on a tostada shell. It was ok i wasnt blown away like i thought. I may have to try a diffrent dish on the menu to see this place stacks up. This place isn't cheap as you can see on the menu."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Damn!  I effing love this place!  I've been a lot and have always had great food and good service.  The oysters are a must have app, with a little squeeze of lime and a dash of salt...my mouth is watering now!  The little woman and I both usually get one of their cocktails (shrimp, octopus, squid, snail) served with chips and some avocado. The shrimp ceviche is another favorite, nice and limey. The last few times, however, my gal ordered fish.  I believe it was cooked in garlic and butter and came with rice and beans and it was phenomenal!  Sometimes they have live mariachi music, which just adds to the greatness!"}
{"text":"We came here as a last minute option, but have to say my meal which was the fish fillet with garlic sauce rice and beans was Fab! My date ordered a grilled shrimp meal that came with beans and rice. He loved it! They had some live musica in the dining room. And we drank Coke imported from Mexico. Good place, we definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Very good mexican food.  The kind I am used to.  Shrimp cocktail was really good.  I have never been to this part of town and it was a little sketchy but I'm still alive and I would go back."}
{"text":"Authentic!   The shrimp rancheras is awesome,  salsa rocks & servers are fabulous.   Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I had shrimp and fish ceviche but the veggies weren't really marinated it just tastes like they chopped the veggies right there and then not really traditional... Customer service was good the girls were really nice"}
{"text":"4 stars because even though I don't like seafood, the non seafood items I had here were delicious! I got the enchiladas, one of them with green sauce. The enchiladas were excellent, the salsa was great, and the server was friendly. I didn't like the ceviche tostada but that's my own issue--the person I was eating with loved it. If I liked seafood, I would eat here often."}
{"text":"Another outstanding Phoenix find!  This place isn't much to look at but the food is fantastic.  I had the Filete Relleno de Mariscos.  It was a fish filet (tilapia I think) stuffed with octopus, shrimp, squid, and snails smothered with a spicy tomato based sauce - fabulous!  I must have looked like a Minnesotan, because when I asked the waitress about it, she warned me that it was very spicy!  I assured her that I like spicy and it was a perfect amount of heat.  My wife had fish tacos and loved em!  

They serve a salsa unlike any I've tasted.  It wasn't real tomatoey and was brown with just the right amount of spice.  I asked the waitress how it was made but her English wasn't too good and my Spanish is non-existent, so I'll never know.

The extent of seafood at most Mexican restaurants is confined to shrimp dishes.  The menu here is saturated with different seafood options.  If you like seafood Mexican style you must try Mariscos Acapulco."}
{"text":"If you want overpriced tasteless mariscos this is your place. Its smaller than your average popular mariscos in phoenix and doesnt have those loud live bands(it did have karaoke). But the food was just bland and extremely overpriced. The servers keep trying to push to buy more beer(gets annoying) and never offer to refill sodas or water, just beer(strange). I had the shrimp and octopus coktel. and it was just plain. no good flavor. I think i have given up on Phoenix marisco restaurants. as they are all the same concept: overpriced food and the place to come to show off you can buy a bunch of beer."}
{"text":"I went here because it was the closest restaurant to Discount Tire... What an awesome place, and I will go out of my way to go back! 

Friendly staff, clean restaurant, and outstanding food. Chips and salsa were great, and the food was delicious!

Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely AMAZING!  This is truly authentic homemade Mexican food!  The service is great, but truly most importantly, you keep wanting to order more (even when you're stuffed) because it's so GREAT!  We came twice in one day!!

The MARGS are amazing!  Order Don Julio silver margarita!  

Try this place and you'll be hooked.  There's no other place I'm going when I want true, homemade, flavorful Mexican food!

On top of it all, they have mariachis and also have boxing events - Alvarez and Cesar!  Come join the fun, great food and amazing margaritas and drinks!

MULTIPLE THUMBS UP!!!!!"}
{"text":"I tried the oysters and they were great! The staff was nice and the atmosphere was upbeat. I will be eating here again,thanks"}
{"text":"I really want this place to be good.  I love seafood and it's only 2 or 3 blocks from where I live.  I've been twice now, and both times it's just been... meh.  It's not bad, but I have no intention of going back.  The plates seem expensive for a joint like this. The chips were too thick. The salsa wasn't that great. And most importantly my fillets haven't been very delicious.  Maybe their shellfish and meats are different, but the fish fillets just aren't worth it.

The staff is friendly enough, and the service is quick enough, but I don't think I'll be swinging by here again."}
{"text":"Boy, talk about HEAT!! Get ready to pant like a dog! The salsa had a different shade of color to it than the traditional red salsa. This was a bit dark orange/ brick red color. And boy was it HOTTTTTTT. Kicked my butt!!!!! It was so good I couldn't stop eating it. Even though I had tears and a runny nose. I ordered the Molcajete Marinero. It came with rice and beans. It was sizzling hot and mouth burning spicy. Just the way I like it! I'm not fond of octopus because it has a lingering after taste in my mouth. Next time I will have them omit the octopus. The red chili sauce in the bowl was very good but have something cold to drink handy because it can make you cry! I really enjoyed my entree but I think $18.25 was way too expensive.  My friend ordered Mixto Camaron y Pulpo. The portion was large, as it should be for $12.80. He said the flavor was good. The only thing that was disappointing is that it only had 4 shrimp in the entire bowl. The restaurant staff was very nice, accommodating, and informative. There are some authentic mexican restaurants that give us the feeling we are not appreciated there. Not, Marscos Acapulco. Everyone from the waitress to the cook made us feel welcome. I would like to return and enjoy another meal here. YUM!"}
{"text":"I had oysters, shrimp ceviche, crab enchiladas, and a Modelo to wash it all down.  This place does seafood right!  I tried the shrinp cocktail as well and it was delicious!  If I lived in Phoenix I would come here every week.  The prices were great, the service was wonderful, and the owner came out to say hi as well.  Next time I want to get a group together and go when they are singing karaoke."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I usually get the pulpo tostadas, but everything is sooo good it's hard to decide.  It is usually packed during the lunch-time hours, especially on the weekends, so if you're in a hurry it's  probably better to go on more off-hours.  But DO go - it's clean, fresh, and delicious."}
{"text":"Great place it was our first time and ill definitely come back. Our server andres was fantastic"}
{"text":"I LOVE their shrimp ceviche! Sometimes it tastes different though depending on the cook. I always get the one with the octopus. Their salsa is on point and their drinks are refreshing. Love the little grupos that play in here too. At least at this Mariscos you don't get frisked. That's a plus!"}
{"text":"This place serves up some of the best campechanas(mixed seafood cocktail) around. They also serve various other seafood and meat dishes. It is a little hole in the wall place that you wouldn't expect to find such good food. I eat here at least two times a week or more and can't wait to come back for more. The service is always great and sometimes the owner will come in and chat with customers to see how everything is,which shows he really cares about the customers."}
{"text":"First time here I called in an order. When arrived there was no one at the desk and no hostess. Took about 15 min to get any help. when I did finally get help she went to pick up my order which I had noticed was sitting there when I arrived. That was not cool I was not about to pay for some cold ass food that had been sitting for 15 min or possibly longer"}
{"text":"Alright...


Came here this weekend with my husband and 1 year old daughter.  We parked and I immediately noticed a jagged and shattered beer bottle in the parking lot in front of the door right by my new car tire.  (Nice touch...)

The inside of the restaurant is clean, a little crowded, but fine otherwise.

Our waitress was very sweet and helpful.  The menu was a dizzying selection of Mexican seafood that was almost overwhelming.  She brought us some chips and salsa, they were tasty, but the chips would have been even more delicious if they been served warm.  I liked the salsa, it was a brownish, low heat salsa that I've never had before.  It was pleasant.

I ordered the shrimp chevice tostada and since he's allergic to shellfish (the poor bastard) the husband had the cheese enchiladas.  We also ordered a side of rice for the baby.  

My tostadas were okay, but they were store bought tostadas (because deep frying a fresh corn tortilla for each new diner is too much work?) and the shrimp chevice was way too limey (the overwhelming flavor) and not nearly spicy enough.  I would have preferred a few thinly sliced jalapenos and maybe some more cilantro in the mixture.

The red sauce on my husband's enchiladas looked watery and artificial and just like canned tomato sauce.  It didn't look very authentic, or good, BUT he swore it tasted okay.  (His tummy was also feeling a tad funny the rest of the day, but that could have been from almost anything else too.)

The baby's rice was nice.  It was served with peas, carrots, green beans and corn and it tasted quite good.  Also, the waitress served the baby first and gave her a plastic spoon which was thoughtful.  I suspect the waitress is also a mommy and that's why she got the baby's food out first and knew to give her a plastic spoon... ;)


Our bill for 2 iced teas, 2 shrimp chevice tostadas, cheese enchiladas and a side of rice was about $23.00.  Not too bad, I just wish the food was a tad more zippy and the tostada had been freshly made."}
{"text":"I know it looks like a hole in the wall, but the food is out of this WORLD. I was introduced to this place by some co-workers who are very familiar with what good REAL Mexican food is. This is it, we have been going back religiously since... The mocajete (i think), is this bowl of seafood tomato sauce, spices and cheese that is made and served in a lava rock bowl, it is still boiling when it makes it to the table. Not only is it HOT but it is also SPIIIIIIIIICY! Delicious...."}
{"text":"Good hole-in-the-wall place. Was recommended by some new friends I met in Arizona. They knew the owner and was highly-recommended. We went for dinner on a Monday night so it wasn't packed at all. Service was good, a tad slow, but we weren't in a rush.

Food: was good. ordered a shrimp cerviche, fresh and tasty. 7 Mares, a flavorful and seafood meaty soup. To quench the thirst, I tried the Micheladas, a bloody mary type drink mixed with beer, a spicy treat. 

From the look of the local feel, this place seems like it'll be a great happy hour location to. Hope to find out one day when I visit AZ again."}
{"text":"OMG! I LOVEEE this place! Mariscos Acapulco I'm sold!

Not only were the staff ridiculously nice and friendly. The food was BOMB.COM.

I am Latina, so hence look Latina, but I don't speak Espanol. I know I know, blame my mom for not letting my dad teach me! Anywhooo, this always happens, they started speaking to me in Spanish, I try to follow as best I can, but I just wasn't getting it, so at the observation of the confused look on my face the gal asked me if I speak Spanish, I shook my head no and instead of following in the manner of many other not so nice responses I've gotten, she said OK and proceeded to describe what I was asking about in English, even a gentleman behind her sort of helped out. I thought that was very nice as often people will make a mockery of me or make me feel weird for not speaking Spanish, but they surely didn't...

Sooo once I placed my order for the Shrimp Ceviche Tostadas (to-go) I was greeted by a friendly Senor who mumbled something to me in Spanish, I once again said, no habla Espanol and only then did I realize that English was clearly NOT his first language. He was SO NICE and instead of walking away and not even bothering, he started speaking to me in English, he took his time to gather the words and slowly get out what he was trying to say. I was definitely listening. He offered me a free bottle of water while I waited, he thanked me for coming, he told me that he was happy I am there, etc. I was so baffled at this guy! He GENUINELY cares about his restaurant AND the people that go there. He also offered me a Margarita, but since I was on my lunch break (darn! haha) I settled for a Sangria Senorial (don't worry, it's non-alcoholic, sort of like grape juice or something). Normally I don't like taking hand outs, honestly, it makes me feel awkward, but I could tell that me accepting his offer genuinely made him happy.

So NOT ONLY were the people a dream the food was SOOO GOOD! Ahhhh. BOMB ceviche, probably the best I've ever had north of the border. Straight up! I like how it was packaged, the portion was generous and the price was definitely reasonable. It only ran about $8 bucks for two of them! I NEVER and I mean NEVER tip on to-go orders, but this time I was so impressed, I absolutely did!

GO CHECK THEM OUT! DO IT! NOWWW! LOL.

P.S. I guess on Fri/Sat/Sun nights they have karaoke too! LOL. He basically said something along the lines of you can bring your significant other and sing love songs or whatever you like. Hahaha. Does a blow up doll boyfriend count? lol."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Mexican seafood (mariscos) place in the Valley. The problem is, I don't know then name of the plate I ordered.  I pointed at a picture in the menu. It was a shrimp dish with tomatoes, onions and diced serrano peppers. I did take a photo of my plate so it'll be in the photo booth. I deducted one star because I ordered iced tea and it was stale tasting iced tea from a pump. Not my favorite. Other than that, my dish was BOMB!! The rice was perfectly fluffy, the beans were so flavorful and topped with crumbled queso fresco. They give you chips and salsa, which were both really good and the service was great! I've been here before but had never reviewed it. This was my favorite visit of the 3 times I've been. Boy I hope it doesn't change. I WILL be back."}
{"text":"We ordered shrimp burrito and the shrimp smell was VERY strong when it came out. The burrito was bland and it was hard to get past the smell. I added s&p, asked for salsa and lime so I can eat at least half of it. Very bland for a Mexican place."}
