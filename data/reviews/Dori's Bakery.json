{"text":"Love this place... I know we are creatures of habits and buy this sort of stuff at Fry's or Safeway, but give your local baker a shot and you are sure to be impressed... Love the canolis and lemon bars.  Can't seem to go in to this place and not leave with some extras...  French bread is off the hook, i'll never go Frys again for it...   Also the pies... I think its been a long time since I've had a non frozen pie, these were def made from scratch and mind blowing... apple carmel had a perfect amount of tartness... will be getting some more for christmas with the family!"}
{"text":"What a little gem of a place! I'm so happy I found this place. First of all, the owner is the sweetest person. Second, everything is fresh and homemade from scratch. I was able to try the red velvet cupcake before buying and I can't explain how amazing it was. So I got those and her chocolate ones in addition to her coffee rolls, lemon bar, as well as her hand peeled apple turnovers. Last but not least she stated to feel free to text her special orders! I'm sending everyone I know here!"}
{"text":"We have been in a few times, even tried the sandwiches. We would like to RAVE about the crumb cake! Everything we have had is good but the crumb cake is sublime!"}
{"text":"How much do I love having a good bakery only a few minutes from my house? A lot. I've been to Dori's several times now, and have not been disappointed in the baked goods. The Danishes and apple bread I've bought for breakfast were delicious, as were the sandwiches I've had for lunch (chicken salad and turkey/avocado). The bread on those sandwiches was amazing, with such great flavor and texture, that when my cousin needed good bread for fancy tea sandwiches she was serving at a birthday party, I went straight to Dori for white and wheat bread. I heard several people at the party commenting on how delicious the bread tasted, and they were right. Can't wait to try even more treats here."}
{"text":"I'm sold! This place is awesome! I love supporting local businesses, and this is why. No Sprinkles cupcake can compare to Dori's red velvet! And her cinnamon buns! They are absolutely to die for! Haven't tried her lunches yet, but she makes many award winning foods, so I'm excited to try something!"}
{"text":"I noticed signage for this place one day and decided to drop in.  Cute but very small interior space.  I decided to purchase a cinnamon roll that day.  It was delicious.  The guy attending the counter was very nice.  Promised myself that I wanted to try their sandwiches on my next visit.  

Fast forward a few months... Was craving a sandwich and remembered this shop so I decided to drop in.  A couple of customers were in the lobby and one suggested that I try the Chicken Salad sandwich (that was what he was eating at the time and mentioned that they had just made fresh bread).  The other suggested the French Dip.  I chose the Chicken Salad.  Decided to get the combo with the pasta salad side and drink.  That sandwich was outstanding!  I think the bread really made the sandwich!  The pasta salad, which I had saved for the following day, was good as well.  Dori was very nice.  

I am definitely keeping this place in mind for future quick meals and pastries (even though I don't need the sugar or the calories)!!"}
{"text":"Dont waste your time. Definiteley not a bakery but trying to be a little sandwich shop. Had maybe 3 baked goods and nothing fresh. Looked to be days old goods. If the lady I talked to the was the owner, she should be more friendly."}
{"text":"This is a very bad bakery.

1. Their eclairs are enormous, which seems good. When you bite in, you realize you're not really eating an eclair. The dough is very much like plain bread, maybe a French roll. It's not the distinctive pastry dough of an actual eclair. (Just eat an eclair pretty much anywhere else if you're not sure what I mean.) It doesn't come off well -- you've basically got a loaf of bread with a bunch of custard in the middle. They don't seem to know how to make pastry dough.

2. The cinnamon roll isn't sweet. I don't mean it wasn't sweet ~enough~. I mean it wasn't sweet at all. The frosting was not sweet, was apparently just a sour cream cheese. I kept trying to find any sweetness in the roll somewhere -- no luck. It was so strange and weird eating a cinnamon roll that had no sugar as an ingredient anywhere, always having this sour cream taste in your mouth. It was very similar to eating a cheap bagel with cream cheese (e.g. a Chompie's bagel -- they're not actual bagels, just rolls with holes.)

I wonder if the cinnamon roll might have been some weird accident by an employee -- I can't imagine people would keep buying unsweet cinnamon rolls with nothing but cream cheese on top. The reviews seem wildly off -- this appears to be one of the worst bakeries one could possibly visit in the Phoenix area, but maybe it was an employee error."}
{"text":"While my car was being serviced I decided to pop in to Dori's to check it out. I ordered a blueberry muffin and it was awesome! The guy at the counter was super friendly and offered to warm it up for me. Fast forward a few hours later and my car was STILL being serviced so I called my husband to pick me up. It was around lunch time and we were going to get sandwiches from Subway but decided to walk down to Dori's to try them out. BEST DECISION EVER! The bread was so tasty and the ingredients were fresh (I had a turkey avocado and hubby had the chicken bleu cheese). The French bread was most definitely the best I have ever had; a little crusty on the on the outside but freaking soft in the middle! We both ordered the potato salad which is homemade and not the stuff that comes from the tub. It was so good that we will definitely be back! Oh, I forgot the red velvet cupcake. The frosting was very creamy and the cake was moist and delicious. For 99 cents you cannot go wrong :)"}
{"text":"The staff at Dori's is always friendly and helpful. My kids LOOOOOVE the cinnamon rolls and the elephant ears are my favorite. I only wish I could go more often. I think it is so important to support local businesses and this is one I will definitely continue visiting!"}
{"text":"This my number one bakery I go to for everything!! The customer service is outstanding!! Any time I could be craving something but I don't know what DORI'S BAKERY has got it and if I need recommendations Dori is always there to help u make the best choice :) Dori and staff are the friendliest around!  The bread and food is always first class fresh because she makes them in the morning and the food is made when u order it!  The food here is what I like to call \"home/comfort foods\" cause its all delicious. Not one thing I have tried has been anything under par of spectacular:) I highly recommend this bakery for anybody looking for the next best thing!"}
{"text":"**CLOSED** ~ this place is no longer in business!

Don't know if they've relocated but they 
don't run a bakery out of this location anymore. Used to have great .99 cent bread."}
{"text":"Went in for a loaf of French Bread for my spaghetti and meatball dinner I was making. My family loved the French bread. I noticed they also has homemade pies. I will definitely be going back! Got's to get me some Pie."}
{"text":"After weeks of hearing about this place from my Mom, I decided to give it a try. WOW!! All her bread is baked fresh daily and it is the yeasty, chewy kind like a cornish split. Her sandwiches are amazing and so are the soups which are made fresh each day. I have had the french onion and the cream of mushroom which were both great! Her chicken salad is award winning! The desserts are sinful!! I can't say enough!!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this little bakery and Dori, the owner. We are alyways  pleased with the decadant pastries and especially the rolls. HOLY COW...the ROLLS ARE AWESOME!!
 She hooked us up with a plethera of cut out cookies for Christmas for our kids to decorate at home and everytime we go in she has a little extra treat for my son at no charge. Juat a fantastic little hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Bread is great pastries not-so-much.  The owner (I am assuming) was super nice and friendly.  
I came in for cupcakes, asked about cake pricing which is about 3$ more per half sheet, understandable for the small guy BUT the were hot, and tasteless.  I took a variety of cupcakes to see what would be best for the office and there was honestly nothing great about any of them. I received them hot flat and melty looking.

HOWEVER- I bought a bag of french bread fresh for a dollar! It was AMAZING.  Bread was FANTASTIC.  

IF I happen to be in the same area and need bread I might stop in but its not a convenient location for me so probably not, I would prefer to get the organic bread form the co-op down the way.

Baked pastries not-so-much."}
{"text":"Husband got me a red velvet cupcake from here. I thought it was the worst red velvet cupcake I've ever had. Tasted more like a yellow cake with the cream cheese frosting on top. The frosting wasn't all that great either."}
{"text":"Discovered this place last week. 99 cent french bread everyday and cookies - YUM! They also have sandwiches. I will try them for lunch soon."}
{"text":"I stopped there yesterday and the place was empty. No sign that they moved so apparently they closed up shop. Does anyone know why?"}
{"text":"Have visited several times. The first visit I purchased a loaf of pumpernickel bread. It had that hearty homemade texture and taste. I met Dori and she stated that she doesn't always have pumpernickel, but will make a loaf for you if you call ahead.
My second visit was an off day for Dori. I had hoped for some soup and sandwich. There was no soup ready at 11am that day and they were out of the stuff for the sandwich I wanted. There was no pumpernickel bread that day so I left without a purchase.
The third visit went better and I was able to get some terrific baked goods to take home.
Dori seems to be working very hard to make this small, local business successful and would recommend her tasty baked goods, but do not expect to find the same items on every visit."}
{"text":"ok I have a new favorite thing here- Pasta salad! I don't get excited about pasta salad but this was goooood pasta salad! Though I am disappointed the chicken salad sandwich wasn't dill-y like usual today :( Still one of my favorite lunch places!"}
{"text":"Dori's Bakery is amazing! She made our wedding cake on short notice, and it turned out beautiful and delicious. Her red velvet (top tier) was a hit at the wedding, but my personal favorite was the marble cake (bottom tier). We had about half the cake left over, but left it out for guest to pick on throughout the rest of the weekend and it was finished by Monday! She worked within our tiny budget, and delivered a million dollar cake on short notice. We also grab lunch there occasionally- try the chicken salad sandwich! Great food and owner!"}
{"text":"I went to this location today after seeing the sign for Dori's Bakery. I met the owner/baker and she is very nice. She gave me a sample of her chicken salad and I loved it. She has baked goods and also sandwiches, soups, quiche, and chicken pot pie, which you can take home frozen but if you want to eat it there you should call ahead as they take an hour to bake. She said everything is made fresh. I had just eaten over at the Peruvian place in the same center but plan to go back for a soup and salad, maybe a pastry or cookie. Oh yeah,she has  cheesecake, too, but I don't know if is the same kind as the previous place, Arizona Cheesecake had. I would have liked to taste theirs after reading the reviews."}
{"text":"Fantastic little bakery. We ordered a cherry cheesecake for a birthday. It was so rich and creamy we were floored (as in it was so rich and heavy we ended up lying on the couches in food coma). 
We went back a few day later and tried some of the cookies and bread. Not disappointed. 
Looking forward to the next birthday to use as an excuse to try a cake."}
{"text":"Excellent baked goods! The red velvet cupcake was delicious...real cream cheese frosting and I was so glad to find out that their red velvet is not colored with any  yucky red food coloring...Dori's uses natural beet juice!  My mom and I came in and bought a cupcake, a red velvet cake parfait (yum!), dinner rolls (they are huge!) and a cinnamon roll (double yum)! I would definitely recommend them...next year I definitely want to try some of their holiday pies!"}
{"text":"As a coffeehouse owner in Chandler, we have a standing order for Dori's amazing (huge!) Cinnamon Rolls, the best Cheese Danish and Red Velvet Cupcakes EVER! Our customer's come in JUST for these items.   We love supporting small business owners like Dori and appreciate her \"midwest\" kindness also!  We strongly encourage having this bakery on your cell phone speed dial.  Her turn around for orders is quick too!  Love ya Dori!  Lori / SoZo Coffee"}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are MASSIVE!  French bread is amazing.  I always stop in for the fresh bread before I make pasta at home.  I even made my awesome stuffing with their french bread.  Love this place.  Friendly staff, good prices, fresh baked goods.  Support your local businesses!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Fresh, delicious cupcakes, turnovers, pretzels, soups, salads, sandwiches. Very reasonable prices and a talented and friendly owner. It's located in a nice, cozy corner of a shopping strip and it's a quaint location to have a nice lunch on a sunny day. Great place. I ordered a delicious apricot turnover, two peanut butter cookies, and a red velvet cupcake for $6. By the way, the red velvet cupcakes are delicious (with edible pearls on top) and are only 99 cents!"}
{"text":"Although I was not happy at all with the service I got there, appreciate very much that the owner reached out to help try to correct the problem via yelp."}
{"text":"Been meaning to go in this place for weeks as I frequent Safeway.  I am so pleased that I finally did....wow...she is awesome, very friendly and knows how to make a good veggie sandwich...I do eat meat as  well and cannot wait to try the turkey and avocado or no maybe the 1st Prize chicken salad sandwich....yum..so many awesome choices..and she makes the most amazing potato and pasta salad...and I don't really like anybody's but my mom's and well let's say she's next in line next to mom..anyway ya gotta check it out she is tucked way back in the corner so it's easy to miss...oh and while I didn't try her sweets I did buy the big chocolate chip cookie for my teens and they wanted more.....keep up the good work Dori....Cat"}
{"text":"Stopped in today and tried a couple things. I would have to echo another reviewer who talked about the red velvet cupcakes. Dori's cupcakes are delicious. I'll definitely stop by and grab some more next time I'm down in that area."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this bakery!! The BEST cinnamon rolls I have ever had!! Everything is makde fresh everyday and you can defiantly tell!! French bread for only 99¢ I love it for making little sandwiches for my kids and eating by itself. They will make it into a garlic bread for you if you ask. Awesome sourdough bread as well and big breakfast burritos."}
