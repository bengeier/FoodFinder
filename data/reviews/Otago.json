{"text":"Management is far from having their shit together. Food aint worth it. Specialy at that price"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The service sucks and the pizzas are a mess. The management is a joke."}
{"text":"Judging by the other reviews, this place must have changed management/chefs. The venue itself is an intriguing mix of high backed booths along the back, sports bar tables center, and outdoor, poolside tables. We had a family reunion here and ate three meals with about 15 people on average. They have a pizza oven and everyone enjoyed their pizzas immensely. People also enjoyed the steak sandwiches. And I'm talking Philly natives! I had the best Chilean Sea Bass. It was perfect over a spicy pesto with grilled vegetables. They had good entre salads. Martinis were spot on. Service was good with lots of enthusiasm. All in all, a great experience! The rating is for the dish I had and the great martinis."}
{"text":"This is definitely the worst grilled cheese and fries I've ever had.  I didn't even know those two items could be \"the worst.\"  And the service, holy moly, you'd think they were serving something far more worth the attitude!"}
{"text":"Ate here twice as I was staying in the hotel and this was the only convenient option. It was by far worst food I've ever had. The pesto Parmesan Grilled cheese I ordered was nothing  more then soggy bread and on my second visit the hamburger was served completely raw in the middle . After having two bites I felt violently ill And had  to deal with food poisoning for the following 8 hours."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and there is a good variety. They have some of the best salads and the turkey burger is to die for. The fries are on point.  The flourless tarte is insane. The decor of the new location is super fun. The one thing that I do miss is he old location the kitchen was there and the chefs at the time were part of what I loved so much. The one down side is the servers. The waitresses are not great and often make mistakes so I wouldn't recommend it for a quick eat and run. Go when you have at least an hour."}
