{"text":"We enjoy the patio in the hot days of summer that is the reason we came to visit today. To keep this brief the beer and food is usually pretty good. I love the Erie Blue when they have it on tap.. Unfortunately the service is lackluster.  Seems like they areas are always short staffed and staffing on hand is very unfriendly. The guy that did wait on us was very nice though, but he was off the clock and we had another lady that took over. She had a very bad attitude and we were very disappointed. We were one of four patrons on the outdoor patio at the time. Seems like it was a hassle for her to come out and serve us. I did come in and ask for my check, pay her cash so as not for her to waste her  time walking out to the patio. On a positive note the guy that did wait on us apologized for the terrible attitude and service we got from this lady. I am self employed and know what it takes in survive in the customer service arena. It is never good to roll your eyes when a customer comes in to ask for the server. I did tell the server that you are understaffed and could use another server. Hope this review is helpful to the next patron."}
{"text":"Oh Cornerstone, I had such high hopes for you! So maybe I am becoming a snob for food since I have moved too Philly, but I mean we are spoiled out there. Since moving to Philadelphia this fall I have had the pleasure of dining at some great places.   My beau and I are home on holiday visiting his mother in the Cleveland area. After going to a movie yesterday with his mother and sister(who is in the states from Australia) she treated us to dinner at Cornerstone. So the atmosphere was kinda quaint and semi-charming. I liked the old pub/old world feel. I was not impressed with our server. Again it may be due to the fact that wait-staff in Philly are at an entirely higher level. They are all literally professionals and you can tell. She was a sweet older lady but was semi-flighty and did not get some of the orders right. It happens, I work in the industry too so I understand.   So on to food! Oh yeah I am not a beer girl so I did not try any of their beers. I had my staple: a captain and diet. I ordered the porobello \"burger\". It said on the menu it was grilled in stout but I did not taste any flavor of anything. I did not care for the aioli that came on it, so I ordered it on the side but it came on the burger. The ciabatta bread took over the entire meal. I ordered the fruit as a side, and I'm sorry but the sorry little fruit cup sucked. I understand it is winter and most fruit is out of season, but if it is winter in Cleveland and you know what fruit is in an out of season do not get shitty watermelon and cantaloupe and put it in the fruit bowl. Wow, sorry, I did not realize I  was that bent out of shape over fruit!  Over all, I was not impressed. I hope we do not go back there next time we are in town I know Cleveland has WAY better restaurants and am looking forward to one of them to redeem Cleveland's reputation on eateries"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Seven*IPA. Also, it seems as if french onion soup and Caesar salad are common enough, but they outdo themselves here. The soup had an amazing garlic and lager depth to it. Their Caesar salad was made up of romaine and leaf lettuces with a thinner, garlicky dressing. Portions were generous and everyone was friendly. Jay (a brewer) was very efficient and recommended some great beers. I was only in the area for the afternoon and am happy I happened upon the location. Keep up the great work and good luck for the future!"}
{"text":"FINALLY, a brew pub that makes beer that makes good tasting beer.  If you're looking for hop concentrate or something to seal the driveway with, look elsewhere (*cough*Brew Kettle), otherwise invest in a designated driver so that you can take in these tasty beers.  The food and service was very good as well."}
{"text":"Cornerstone is a great local brewery in Berea. The only complaint I have is that seating is limited so sometimes, especially on the weekend, it can take a while to be seated. Otherwise, a charming place. Nice environment, classy place. Near Baldwin Wallace University but you generally don't get the college crowd here and when you do it's definitely not the usual \"college bar scene\". It's a calm, laid back environment. I usually sit in the dining room but there is a nice bar with multiple TVs that usually play whatever sports are happening at that time.  I've had multiple appetizers and entrees and it's all very good. Huge servings and lots of flavor. The penne is very good. They have a variety of seasonal, in-house brewed beers- usually 6-9 different beers to choose from, all of which I'd recommend. Friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"The gem of this place is their food.  Seasonal offerings are really good.  Their pumpkin soup during the fall is amazing.  The beer is good, the atmosphere is great, and it's a good location for a business lunch.  I'm a homebrewer, and the brewmaster let me poke around and ask him some questions about his process and ingredients.  I was impressed by this."}
{"text":"We were headed to watch the Indian beat the Tigers and stopped by this neat Brew Pub . The owner/brewmaster was nice enough and took us on a tour of his operation . We had a sample of the wonderful beers and ales that he has created . They have a tasty IPA called 7. and a  lager called Grindstone Gold and of course a summer wheat . We tried them all and were impressed . They offer full service menu and the staff really seemed to care about the customers . You can't go wrong with a pit stop here . We will be sure to stop back for lunch ."}
{"text":"the beers on draft were pretty good. THey had just released their pumpkin beer, Linus' revenge, which was surprisingly my favorate of the night. I thought \"Seven\" their IPA was slightly below average. the hop aroma was perfect but when I took a drink the bitterness didn't balance with the rest of the body.  I would go back anytime."}
{"text":"Wanted something casual and easy on a Friday night while visiting Cleveland and boy, did this place do the trick!  Great service, yummy beer, and delicious food.  The white pizza was fab and the western pizza was great, as well.  But, the beer cheese fondue was our favorite.  Well worth a little drive outside of downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Love love love the beer. The beer selection is spot on. We spoke with one of the brewers I believe named Jay...very well spoken when we asked about the different beers. We ordered an appetizer that was southwest style chicken egg rolls...my mouth is watering thinking about them! Absolutely delicious!   The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous and is a very comfortable environment."}
{"text":"Came here while on vacation and it was great. Beer brewed in house was awesome and had runen sandwich and beer french onion soup. Awesome job and clean. Server was great and i will definitely be back next time im in cleveland."}
{"text":"Service is a joke. Food is terrible. Can't possibly get any more awful than this place. Couldn't pay me to spend another dollar here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and a pint during our recent visit to the North Coast. What a great place!! We were there at the tail-end of lunch time and the restaurant was crowded. We sat that the bar and were greeted immediately. Service is topnotch with that oh so friendly, familiar Cleveland way. Food was quite good, the beer is very good. All-in-all we heartily endorse this place!!"}
{"text":"I was afraid this place was going to be terrible food with ok beer but I was wrong on both counts.  The food was surprisingly good and the beer options were plentiful, even for those of us who do not enjoy bitter brews.  I settled for a fruit based beer that was not sweet at all and deceptively strong. It went down very smooth and I wished I had sprung for a tall as I finished my glass off way too soon.   I also had the turkey rueban and probably some of the best fries I have had in a while.  The turkey was piled high on toasted rye bread and the sandwich was dripping with just the right amount of dressing.  The fries were thick, seasoned, and fried to a perfect crisp.  Service was a bit spotty, they were not busy and it took several minutes for someone to acknowledge us and seat us, and then several more minutes for someone to make it to our table for drink orders.  However, once they realized they kept us waiting they were on the ball with the rest of our order.  Next time I am in Cleveland and looking for a quick bite to eat, I will head here."}
{"text":"The 3 little pigs pizza is really good and plenty for leftovers. Bacon, pepperoni and sausage.  How could you go wrong?  Beer selection, according to my husband is limited, but ok."}
{"text":"Great pub fare and terrific service.  Try the fish and chips!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, really like this place.  Love that they have their own unique beer drafts.  Had the pizza a few times and it was sub-par in my opinion (but I'm from New York... so all other pizza is sub-par to me haha).  I had fish and chips once and it was AMAZING.  I remember expecting something basic and just being really satisfied with my meal.  Great place to grab some drinks and dinner with friends.  Also, not a bad place to bring a date."}
{"text":"Love their brew, The Sandstone is my favorite. Cozy atmosphere. Good service. Food is terrific. Tonight I'm trying the Bavarian Pretzel Chicken. It was good, but I thought it had way too much Dijon sauce, so order it on the side. I've had the BeerBQ salad, which is good also. Best homemade ranch dressing! Definitely a place you want to try. They prepare meals right in front of you."}
{"text":"Great food! Cute historic town. Friendly service. Definitely a favorite when in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Went the 1st time on 8-6-14. The food was amazing, the staff was great. Only problem I had is the beer was warm out of the tap. Only had one beer because of it being warm. Hopefully next time I can sample more of their beer."}
{"text":"I am a bit confused by some of the reviews I have read about this place because I found this place to be great! I am ashamed to say that today was my first visit. I have had this place on my must go list for awhile, solely because it has \"brewery\" in the name.  I love the space that Cornerstone resides in. It is quaint without the smallness. It is clean and I love the open kitchen. Samples of beer are free and the beer is damn good! The Erie Blu is made with fresh fruit (no fruit additives), therefore, explained to my friend and I that is why it is not overly sweet and you can drink more than one.I personally loved the Rosanna, a red ale that to me is perfect because it was not hoppy and had the perfect balance.  The menu has a lot of different options. The pizza looked fantastic (a neighboring patron ordered that). I opted for the Chicken Salad and my friend got the spicy black bean burger. The portions are large and we both loved our choices and we have leftovers for lunch tomorrow- which I am very excited!  This is one of those places where I smack my forehead and say, \"self, I cannot believe you have been missing out on this place for years\"! I cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Cornerstone gets high marks all around.  Love the old school building and the prohibition posters around the bar/dining area.  Anything on the menu is excellent, and the beer has great taste.  I like my beer a little more carbonated than what it comes out of the tap, but I am just being picky at this point of the review.  Overall a very nice place for food & beer."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars for this establishment, I would. When we immediately walked in the bar was full and the bartender said we could just have a seat at a table. Our greeting was \"here are menus, what do you want to drink?\" No, have you been here before or hi my name is. My boyfriend and I waited until a couple left, then moved over to the bar. Minutes later, another couple comes up looking for seats at the bar and the bartender responds, \"oh you guys can sit here, the guy who was sitting here is just a friend\" & proceeded to move his belongings. Mind you, the person's belongings who he moved, was complaining out loud about how badly he needs a job and how he needs to make a certain amount and it was obnoxious. The bartender served me a flat beer, then when I sent it back he said, \"yeah I knew it was flat, it's at the end of its keg.\" Then why would you serve it to a guest? I promise you beer doesnt go flat at the end of a keg. Being in the restaurant industry and a bartender myself, that's just horrible customer service. This bartender or whatever he may call himself was touching his face and other things before delivering guests orders. My boyfriend saw him rub his nose, pull out his phone & play on it then cough in his hand while getting ready to run our food. My boyfriend walked over to him and said, \"No disrespect but I'm a restaurant manager and I'd appreciate it if you washed your hands before serving my food.\" The entire time he was on his phone and too busy talking to the customer drinking water and hanging out behind the bar, instead of actual paying guests. This was our first time here and we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"After Brew Kettle we stopped up at Cornerstone Brewing. It was in a very nice little part of town with lots of little shops in the area. -Walking in we realized it isn't your typical brewery. This brewery was polar opposite of Brew Kettle...EXTREMELY fancy. It was more of a nice restaurant that happened to brew their own beers. -As for the beer, I had the Seven IPA (it was just okay), Red Headed Step Child (not bad), Evil Entity X (I think it was a black IPA, it was just okay), Angry Gorilla (hint of banana, it was tasty).  -As for food we had the pesto pizza, it was very good! -Worth checking out if you're around, but they do not bottle any of their beers, not even sure if they do growlers I didn't ask, but nothing jaw dropping unfortunately...they didn't even really have merch for sale which was unfortunate. But the food is good and beer is decent."}
{"text":"Had a great time here! We had to wait for a table but this is a very popular spot and it was well worth it!  The Food: Great! I had the turkey Ruben and it was delish!!! Fries are GREAT too. Awesome flavor. Definitely get the deep fried pickles as an appetizer also. Good variety on their menu while keeping things simple. Burgers, wraps, salads, pizza, etc - but none of it seems to be the usual affair - in otherwords, you'll love it! Familiar but far better than what you've had elsewhere.  The Drinks: Great selection for all tastes and being a brewery they have a moderate selection of beers for everyone. We tried the sampler and got a great taste of what they do. Naturally I didn't like every single one (I'm a fan of IPAs personally and 'Seven' was amazing) but whatever your taste is they've got something you'll enjoy.  The Service: Great staff!! For how busy they were we got everything quickly and our waitress did a wonderful job making sure our experience was top notch!! Service at the bar was great too as we had a drink while waiting for our table.   The Atmosphere: The place had a healthy, welcoming buzz. Great for spending time with family and friends. It's a small place but you won't feel cramped and the kitchen is right in front of you next to the bar. Definitely a cool set up!  The Value: I didn't pay but prices on the menu were definitely reasonable.   The Bottom Line: If you're in the area or even if you have to make a trip to visit Cornerstone, do it! You will not be disappointed!! Great food, drinks, and service. This is easily one of the best in the area! First time going and I had a great experience and I will DEFINITELY return!"}
{"text":"Get the beer onion soup - you won't regret it unless you are severely lactose intolerant, and even then it's probably worth it. Their pizzas are the perfect size for two to split comfortably. Not a great selection for vegetarians, but it's possible to find something for everyone."}
{"text":"Most of their food is brewed in beer (not Gluten-Free friendly). However, they have a cool vibe here. Local B-W Conservatory students often play here.   When I went to B-W it had different owners so I can't be 100% sure what memories are from the current owners and which ones are from the former owners. Judging by Berea insider stories, the current owners would NOT want to be confused for the former owners.   Things I have stolen from the (now) Cornerstone: A plate (on the snowy night of the infamous 4 person party held at apartment 82).   An old copy of The Scarlet Letter that was part of the decor. It just seemed like it wanted me to take it home.   B-W students and well versed Berea residents like this local micropub."}
{"text":"I like meeting friends who live in different parts of the west side here because Berea is a good midpoint. Downtown Berea is quaint and has a small-town vibe to it despite being in Cuyahoga County. Lots of parking and an overall nice atmosphere here.  The star of the show at Cornerstone IMO is the food -- everything I have tried has been really good, hot and fresh. The craft beers are decent -- not as good as Fat Heads or Brew Kettle, but good enough to just meet some friends in a warm atmosphere, relax, and chew the rag.  Prices are also very reasonable, which is nice. I have had some problems with the service -- it is in general timely, but sometimes disjointed and not too cordial.   Overall, I would consider the Cornerstone a hidden gem and plan to keep coming back."}
{"text":"The food here is much better than expected and they were able to help split dishes even without asking! Jay was our waiter and provided top notch service, which made it a 5 star experience.  The steak was really underrated and was juicy and perfect medium rare. Great recommendation from Jay.  The diablo chicken was spicier than I expected for a bar, which was perfect. I'd say it is not overly spicy and is manageable for the average person. The pasta was really nice and creamy.  Salad was nothing overly special and was okay   The beers were okay, favorite was the summer wheat beer. Everything else was good but just not my cup of tea"}
{"text":"I'll give the four out of five because I really enjoyed our meal, but the beer left quite a bit to be desired. My fiance and I both got flights of beer, I liked their Sandstone Lager, an Oktoberfest style beer or Marzen which I felt was pretty good, but nothing else really impressed me. My fiance liked the Linus's Revenge, a pumpkin beer quite a bit. The beer wasn't bad, just not very outstanding, especially relative to the many choices of microbreweries we have in Cleveland. The food however was excellent. We chose to split the Mahi Mahi fish wrap and the Pesto Chicken sandwich, getting one side of fries and one side of onion rings. The Mahi Mahi was excellent, a little heat with a lot of flavor. The Pesto Chicken was excellent and was even better on the pretzel bun. The fries were very good, but the onion rings were outstanding with a nice thick breading, and still a very slight crunch to the onion. All in all I'd give the beer a 3/5 and the food a 5/5 to get the 4/5. I wouldn't come running back here, but if in the Berea area, I wouldn't hesitate to stop by."}
{"text":"This was my favorite bar during college. Since I've been a regular for 8 years, I'll stick to my last visit, followed by a brief lowdown of my favorites:  1) Apricot Walnut Salad   Mixed greens tossed with house made apricot vinaigrette; topped with crumbled bleu cheese, toasted walnuts and dried apricots.  You can add grilled chix or salmon, I usually order a Small with the Salmon so I can have an app, too.  The server, Andrew recommended a bottle I haven't gotten my Paws on (yet), and it was everything and more than I thought it would Be:  Dave Matthews Band \"Dreaming Tree\" Chard, in tandem with his recent Sonoma County collaboration (Constellation Wines)  Ethereal.  2) White Pizza   Extra virgin olive oil, roasted garlic, sliced vine ripe tomatoes, oregano, provolone, and fresh mozzarella cheeses. I cheat and add either cappicola or thin-sliced sausage  Re: beers, I default toward stouts, porters nowadays.  Their Seven IPA and SandStone (Marzen/Oktoberfest) are the most infamous though."}
{"text":"We were in town for a baseball tournament and found this place on Yelp.  The service was AWESOME.  We all really enjoyed our food and all of the beers I tasted were great.  Will definitely come back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"i don't really want to give the place a \"meh\" review but neither my girlfriend or i was all that impressed with our food.  i had a cod sandwich and fries w/ a bowl of beer onion soup. the soup, honestly, was really good. i've had better sandwiches. i forgot to ask for no cheese and when my sandwich came it was all i could taste. the tartar sauce - usually my favorite part - was dull and tasteless.  Danielle had a bourbon glazed chicken sandwich. she said it could have used more of the glaze.  Neither of us hated it but we're in no immediate hurry to go back.  i was pleased to see they still had their own Christmas Ale. it was ok. the after taste wasn't great but wasn't incredibly bad. Danielle's Grindstone Gold also had an aftertaste which she didn't like at all and didn't finish her beer.  At some point, I'm sure we'll go again. Nothing terrible just not mindblowing either."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful date night at the cornerstone. The burgers were juicy and delightful, I do recommend the fries, they were crispy and tasty. Onion soup was awesome, full of onions and melted cheese on top. Service was fast and friendly. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is my son's favorite restaurant, and everytime we go to see him he insists we eat here.  Good thing it's a good place!  First of all, they have a beer and cheese fondue that I guess they only serve on the weekends.  It is simply YUM in a crock.  Swear to god, I nearly just stuck my whole face in it and died a happy girl.  That could be one food I could eat every day for the rest of my life and not be one bit sad.  The only thing that would make it better is if they made their own pretzels - if that ever happens, don't tell me because I won't be able to tear myself away.  All of the sandwiches we have had there have been great.  We all order different foods and share so we can all taste all of the foods.  The barbeque sauce is awesome, and their Ruben sandwich is one of the best I've ever had.  My daughter had the Chicken Salad Melt and it was not only beautiful to look at, but tasted amazing.  The one drawback is that sometimes the service there is a little slow - another server would do wonders.  If you're in Berea, stop by Cornerstone, grab ya a nice beer (oh, great craft beers as well!!!), a yummy sandwich, and a vat full of that beer and cheese fondue, eat till you're about to burst, then stroll a block to listen to some good music at the Conservatory.  Well worth the trip.  Oh, and GO HUNGRY, you will be full!!"}
{"text":"Great little place to take people from out of town. Had some friends in on layover from the airport and had a great lunch! The brews and food were both excellent."}
{"text":"One of the few breweries I actually visit due to the food and not the beer. Food can be really good, especially for a brewpub. Plenty of seating, and a decent sized bar. Beer is only ok. Table service can be slow; I usually grab a seat at the counter. As with Mike's Bar, the location is good and convenient to the airport. So I would recommend to people looking for a bite/beer on their way out of town or to locals... not really worth a long trip."}
{"text":"Writing this for my husband, he attempted to have a drink and some thing to eat at the bar recently, sat at the bar for at least 15 minutes while several employees walked past him but do you think someone would wait on him.  Nope.  So he left. Shame on you Cornerstone management !"}
{"text":"This is a great place! The people are nice the food is good and the beer is FANTASTIC! What else do you want?"}
{"text":"Great place and it's been around a long time.  Not one of those trendy new beer bars.   I wish I lived closer"}
{"text":"Great food and beer, but there were a ton of fruit flies buzzing around our table the whole time. Service was very good."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my sister and a friend. Great food. I am watching what I'm eating and got a lovely salad with some grilled chicken. The chicken was nice and juicy and tender. My sister got a chicken sandwich and raved about it. The fries looked amazing and apparently were! Our friend got a burger, and was pleased too. Service was decent and we will surely go back. I'm going to have so sample the beer.  It looked very tasty!"}
{"text":"Craft beer was good.  You can tell the bartender has been a bartender for years and not the type of bartender that is used to taking care of craft beer.  Her pours would be sloppy and wasted a lot of the beer, which I know when it comes to a beer that is in-house produced you try to stay away from the old style of pouring.  Had an appetizer of pretzels.  Not a bad bar pretzel.  We had the flights of beer so we were able to try all there craft beers, all were good.  Two out of stock during our visit."}
{"text":"Average bar food, small portions for the price. Steak sandwich was seasoned well and cooked to order. Did not have to wait long at all. Service was awesome."}
{"text":"Ok, this may be a once upon a never ever again kind of deal, but Cornerstone, you've pissed me off, and quite frankly, I may not return for a VERY long time.  (ps, Cornerstone, I frequent you often and live in the hood.)  The beau and I stopped in for dinner and a beer Thursday night.  Our waitress was Jennifer.  She isn't a usual suspect, at least from all the times I have been there.  She was nice enough, but OMG her server skills blew chunks....big ones!  I waited over 10 minutes to place my beer order.  The beer came & instead of her asking to take our order, she left....  Nope, no order taking here.  Another million years later, she arrived to take our order.  It was simple, chix fingers & fries, and a cod sandwich.  The guests at the table next to us arrived a good 15-20 minutes after we had, they had there dinner completed and eaten before I even saw mine arrive!  My dinner waited under the \"hot lamps\" for well over 10 minutes.  The beau's food wasn't started until after mine was done & then they both finally sat in the window.  Note to chef....an open kitchen is just that, I CAN SEE YOU!!!!  Why did I have to ask another server to get our food after Jennifer proceeded to stand, talk to the cook, and open mail?!  Hello?!!?!  There are like 10+ servers / kitchen staff on hand tonight & max 5 tables filled.  This is NOT rocket science.   I asked the chick who brought my food to zap it since it was cold & dead.  What did they do?  RE-FRY IT!  Ok, thank you for that extra portion of GREASE!  When das mann called the next day to explain the poor service & reason behind our lack of tip, the guy, Brian, says, \"I'll talk to Jennifer about it.\"  Um, hey dude, you're screwing up big time here & it isn't just Jennifer, but your kitchen staff & your other wait staff who was standing around picking their noses!    Seriously, I'm not a happy camper, and will think triple times before I go back or recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with a group of friends on a Saturday afternoon and there was only one server for the entire restaurant.  While she was doing the best she could it was a super slow visit.  The restaurant is located in a cute area and we didn't have any issues with parking at the time that we came.  The variety and tastes of their brews were good and I loved the Reuben pizza that I split with one of my friends.  I am willing to try this place again because of the beer and pizza but the service better be there next time."}
{"text":"I hate to say I'm a regular here working close by I often bring customers in. every time I do I wish I had not. The food is an AAA+ with great meals at fair prices and very good quality. The wait staff is brain dead, inattentive, and remiss. I can't tell you how many times I waited for a server to just notice me and it's not that big for 2-3 staffers to handle, even when it's full. if your not going to pay attention to who comes in and sits down, put a friggin sign up that makes you wait for a server to seat you. Try the great food but don't be in a hurry and bring your police whistle to get some attention."}
{"text":"On our Cleveland Brew tour we stopped by Cornerstone Brewery in Berea, Ohio.  The brewery is located in an old building with loads of character.  They have s very nice selection of beers with lighter beers stealing the show!  I loved the Angry Gorilla hefeweizen & the Cream Ale was nice.  They also serve food ranging from Apps, salads, Wraps & Sandwiches.  The staff is also very nice and attentive.  I would definitely hang out at this place if it was closer to home!"}
{"text":"First time going here and did take out. This place is clean and comfortable. The staff was extremely helpful. I got the cheeseburger and OMG it was delicious. I think I just found my new place for food."}
{"text":"The anticipated return of LINUS' REVENGE. Sweet nectar of pumpkin! Not overly spiced like a lot of pumpkin ales. Also had the BOXFORD BROWN with hints of caramel, toffee and coffee. Bookended around the Cornerstone Chicken sandwich with a side of slaw. The IPA SEVEN is my go-to beer here."}
{"text":"Order the Seven. Then try some of the seasonal beers. The staff knows exactly what they serve. Hell, the food is made right in front of the customers and the beer is brewed in back. The pizzas are delishh and are the right price.  This is a place to come with friends, family, or enemies. I've sat at the high top tables with my girlfriend, at the bar by myself, and with 5 or so tables pushed together with many groups of friends. You get treated the same and food always comes out together and on time.  Right in the heart of downtown Berea and you don't have to wait forever just to get an overpriced meal."}
{"text":"Stop in at least once a week.  Seven is a very good IPA.  Soups are made in house and are exceptional.  The Rueben is very good and I love 3 little pigs pizza.  Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Buffalo chicken pizza is to die for!! Across the menu good food. Beer is par for the course. Excellent spot!!!!"}
{"text":"During our beer tour of 2009, one of the biggest surprises was this tiny, non-descript building in Berea, just off the triangle. We almost passed it by in exchange for yet another Saturday Afternoon at the Beer Engine, and I'm glad we didn't.  Our job through the tour was to drink a \"flagship\" beer and then another one of our choice. The Cornerstone Gold was a tasty lager that reminded me of what beer probably tasted like just before Prohibition. The second, Seven, is an IPA that uses seven different hops. It was a bit muddled, but still tasty.  What really won me over was the food. This didn't taste like your average sort of fare that'd fall off a truck and come from every other kitchen in town. This stuff was good. The Pulled Pork was amazingly well sauced and very well done. It's strange going to a place that's not a barbecue joint and getting good 'cue. And yet, there it is: Perfectly pulled pork piled on a ciabatta roll, topped with cheddar cheese and accompanied with some of the best fries you can buy.  The building is impressive. I can imagine being so close to BW it gets itself pretty busy for kids blowing off steam for cheap happy hour. (2.75 pints says yes) But, for a lazy Saturday mid-afternoon? Head up to Cornerstone to see what they brewin'."}
{"text":"Quaint.  Great beer selection.  Spectacular food.  Great service.   Try the brews. Savor the whiskeys. Most of all, order the damn food!  If you're lucky enough to have Jay as your 'tender, ask his opinion. He's among the highlights here.  The Erie Blu is a must have! Fatstone? Yes. Rusty Pheasant? Of course. Try 'em all if you have a driver or Über. Most of all, look for me. I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of our go to places. Beer is very good and priced right. Appetizers and food selection are solid and rarely disappoint. Staff is like a small family. Atmosphere is very nice.  My only complaint is that they really could use some sound absorption on the ceiling to cut down on noise.  Brick walls are attractive but bad for noise."}
{"text":"Just ok. I've had worse and I've had better. If I had a choice between here and Mike's Bar and Grill two blocks down, I would definitely choose Mike's.   One bathroom for all these people?  Mediocre food. Good beer but I can get that anywhere.  No wow factor here.  Just went don to 1 star. Absolutely HATE having to wait 20 minutes to cash out after my credit card is showing in the billfold"}
{"text":"Four stars for tasty brews and the best fried pickles I've ever had!   We had an early flight out of CLE so we were staying at a nearby hotel over the weekend. We got to the hotel kind of early and Yelp led me to Cornerstone Brewing. And it did not disappoint!   I love that they have small pours available for $2.25 each. I was able to try a few different beers without committing to an entire pint or having to pick a certain amount of pours for a flight. The Scottish ale was tasty as was the beer with blackberry/raspberry whose name escapes me. My husband and cousin both loved the IPA.   The pretzel filled with cheese was excellent (and didn't even need the dipping sauce) although the plain pretzel was too hard and bland. The fried pickles were the best ones I've ever had! They were spears just lightly coated and served with a chipotle ranch dipping sauce.  The interior of the brewery is beautiful with exposed brick and there's plenty of parking outside. The service was friendly and attentive and I'll absolutely come back the next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  One of my 1st places that got me into craft beer.  Jay the brewer is a cool guy that takes time to talk beer.  Food is unbelievable.  Great place to go."}
{"text":"Kinda surprised that the proprietor would tell the consumer how to rate their beer. Sorry, but that's poor service."}
{"text":"The service is horrible, other than spitting in your food it can't get worse. I went in with my wife on a weeknight and we sat at the bar, and sat and sat and sat. The bartender seemed preoccupied with some buddies. There were four or five waitresses standing around doing nothing, after almost ten minutes I asked one of them if she could get us menus and water, she did. This seemed to awaken some sort of primal response in the barman who suddenly realized he had a job to do. We asked some questions about the beers he literally threw a menu at us and said \"you can read can't you?\" OK everyone has an off day so we ordered some appetizers and a flight. Surprisingly the food came before the beer! (Remember we were seated AT THE BAR). The place was nearly empty so again I got an idle waitresses to refill our waters which again awakened the barman who wordlessly shoved our appetizers aside and very rudely put our flight down and walked away. I called him back and asked him to explain the beer. He couldn't be bothered pointed to the menu and walked away. We were done. I left a twenty on the bar and walked out food uneaten and beer untouched. Interestingly not one staff person said a word to us.  So I'm a sucker for breweries. I went back, this time with my son, mid day on a Saturday again at the bar, different barman, no crowd, same ten minute wait for someone to catch my eye, this time we didn't bother to order. We just left. Mike's down the street is way too good to put up with this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on our road trip to Green Bay, Wisconsin and it was worth it! The place was dead but hey what do you expect when you are out of the city and in Ohio at 3pm on a Thursday?  Being a brewery they brew their own beer (fancy that) and it was delish. We kept it pretty simple and had wraps with fries. The wraps were amazingggggg. I had the chicken caesar wrap and the chicken was juicy with just enough caesar dressing. The fries were so good - crunchy and crispy on the outside but creamy soft deliciousness on the inside.  YUM."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp for helping me find this place! I was coming into town with my friend and we needed somewhere to enjoy the afternoon and we were not disappointed with Cornerstone.  It was a nice Saturday afternoon and was not busy. We enjoyed the atmosphere on a high-top table next to the bar. All the staff were friendly and nice. They patio looked nice as well especially for those summer nights when it gets really warm.   We started off with a couple of the brews, the Angry Gorilla and Erie Blu and both were very good. Went great with all the food. We had the onion rings and the pretzel appetizer to start since we had a lot of time to burn and waited to order our entrees. We couldn't decide which one we liked better. The pretzels were huge and nice and hot. I do not like super spicy stuff and the jalapeno/cheese pretzel was not like burning my mouth. The onion rings were crispy and nicely brown, not soggy at all.  After letting that settle, we ordered our entrees, a chipotle steak wrap for me and the spicy black bean burger for my friend. We had enough carbs from our appetizers, so we ordered other sides. Unfortunately, my friend wanted the fresh fruit, but her burger came out with the fries by mistake. We both enjoyed the entrees. The steak in my wrap was cooked perfectly and the dressing on the wrap had a good kick to it. My friend liked the black bean burger. Had a nice chunk of fresh avocado on it.  4 beers, 2 appetizers, the Veggie BB burger, and steak wrap all came to just over $50 which was a great.  We really enjoyed our afternoon and would love to come back if in town again!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times when I was playing practice qualification rounds for the US Amateur in Avon, and also when in the area visiting friends.  This place is your typical brewery themed restaurant.  They offer up some good brews here though.  Nice little patio area out front with w few tables to see the overwhelming (note the sarcasm) scene that is Berea.    Service is always fast and very courteous.  Burgers are fresh, fish and chips are good.  Coleslaw is quite good as are the fries.  When back in the area, I will definitely be willing to come here again."}
{"text":"If you have not been here, you're missing out. We found this business on Yelp, took a chance, passed a few other places (craft breweries) on the way, and... WOW!   So glad we stopped!  The Mahi wrap is just spicy enough. The Rueben...oh my...is phenomenal. And the service...couldn't have been better.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"You could probably call Cornerstone a college bar given its proximity to Berea's Baldwin Wallace University, but I didn't get that feeling during my first visit. My wife and I walked through the doors around 6 on a Wednesday evening and took a seat at the bar. The place was pretty empty and within a couple of minutes the bartender greeted us and took our drink order. The overall look of the space is warm and inviting. It's a repurposed older building so they've got the prerequisites - exposed brick and ductwork, high ceilings long bar, marble bartop, hightops scattered about and a kitchen that's exposed to the dining area. It kind of reminded me of eateries I frequented back in Baltimore only much roomier.  As an avid beer drinker I seek out our local artisans whenever and wherever I can. I hadn't heard of Cornerstone Brewing Company before so I was anxiously anticipating their brews.  On the eve of our visit they were offering a pretty wide selection of beers including their fall seasonal Linus's Revenge (spiced pumpkin ale). Overall, I found their beers to be very well-crafted and delicious. Whenever I visit a new brewpub I always get the sampler. There's no better way to test the mettle of a new brewer than to experience all they have to offer. I ordered the sampler which include a 2oz pour of every beer on tap, 9 in all.   I thoroughly enjoyed every beer each for their own reasons. My favorites included their American IPA, Seven, which I found to be very well-balanced and packed with plenty of citrusy/piney American hop aroma and flavor, and their rendition of a traditional German roggenbier (rye beer) called Rusty Pheasant. I can't get into every beer in detail here because I just don't have the character budget, suffice it to say that the pride and love for the craft is clearly evident in this brewmaster's beesr.  The menu offers a diverse selection of bar food and restaurant fare including beer-battered o-rings and beer onion soup (of course) as well as a grouping of salads, burgers, pizzas and entrées with everything from fish and chips to pretzel crusted chicken. I was honestly surprised to see a brewpub with such a thoughtful and creative offering. On to our experience:  Side Apricot Walnut Salad (cause my wife is constantly trying to get me to eat healthier) - This was a perfect starter, light, crispy, crunchy. The fresh mixed greens were lightly dressed with a tart/sweet house-made apricot vinaigrette and tossed with crumbled bleu cheese, walnuts (the menu states toasted, these were raw) and dried apricots. The salad was tasty, texturally acute and just the right size for two people to nosh on together.   Black and Bleu Burger with Brew Fries- When I'm delving into the dark recesses of a new brew experience I find that the fattier and meatier the food the better. This burger was tasty and fit the bill to a tee. The cajun-seasoned half-pound angus burger was cooked a perfect medium (as ordered) and came topped with bacon and blue cheese crumbles. The soft Kaiser roll was warm, my wife enjoyed the accompanying tomato and the only downside I found was that it was pretty salty. Don't get me wrong, I love my salt, but this was even a bit much for me. The fries, thick-cut and cooked well soaked up the malt vinegar without complaint.  Grilled Chicken Sandwich with Beer-Battered O-Rings - My wife opted for the winged protein and she was quite pleased. The grilled chicken breast was moist, tender and juicy and perfectly sized for its Kaiser roll bed. Served with fresh lettuce and a slice of tomato it was simple and tasty. The onion rings were indeed big and the beer batter was well-seasoned and crispy. I prefer my rings on the thinner side, but batter is definitely the way to go.  We had a good experience during our visit to the Cornerstone Brewing Company. The service was friendly and prompt (sitting at the bar helps), the food was tasty and well prepared and the selection of hand-crafted brews was among the best I've had in Northeast Ohio.  If you find yourself wanting for some filling, reasonably priced grub accompanied by some great beer you owe it to yourself to make the trip.  P.S. The beer sampler was only $9. You can't beat that."}
{"text":"Cornerstone is a great little micro brew with delish dark beers. Their menu features food you would see at a bar but a notch up! They have great appetizers and mean Chicken Diablo. You can sample the beers before you buy and I really recommend doing this every time anyway! The Erie Blue is great and taste like Sam Adams Blackberry Wit beer. The atmosphere is nice and there is an outdoor patio. I am a scotch drinker and their selection is great! They have a great variety and the larger tables make meetings possible and enjoyable!"}
{"text":"This place was random pick on our way out of town after the motorcycle show out near the airport.  It looked promising, but really failed to live up in pretty much every way.  The atmosphere.   It was a little sticky and grungy overall.  Not filthy, but not clean either.  It smelled a little of stale beer.    The service.   Maybe it was the food tour group next to us, but then again maybe not.  Either way, our server was a little \"off\".  She struggled carrying the drinks to the table and had to make several trips each round.  She told us a recently broken finger was the culprit, but her technique was way off and she should have just used a tray (we could see trays sitting on the bar).   Our beer cheese/pretzel appetizer was sitting in the window (6 feet away) for at least ten minutes before anyone brought it out.     The food.  The beer cheese was grainy.  My fish tacos were way overcooked and pretty flavorless overall.   Two people ordered the beef stroganoff, which looked pretty thin to me.  It was more of a broth than a gravy.  Nothing to write home about, that's for sure.  I'd definitely try someplace else."}
{"text":"What time is it? It's update time!   And we're talking clog-my-arteries-but-I-don't-care pub fare.   After a busy day of exploring the Metroparks, plus a stop at Whitey's next door, we needed some sustenance. Beer!  Well, not *just* beer. Some apps, too! Heavenly, creamy, cheesy artichoke dip and soft pretzels to be exact. While I indulged (aka scarfed) what tasted like a jalepeno and cheese stuffed pretzel, I could feel the calories I just burned hiking coming on back. But hey, it was worth it. And what do they put in artichoke dip, anyways? Addictive drugs? I couldn't stop eating this stuff even though I *knew* it wasn't good for me.    The beer is darn tasty, but that's just my opinion. We really wanted to try the Seven IPA. Turns out everyone else did too, so they were out. We ended up with the Grindstone Gold, which also had nice hoppiness.  So, yeah--I still love me some Cornerstone. It wasn't just a college phase. And after reading Sarah V's review, it sounds like I should go back and try to eat a healthy, turkey salad instead. Errr...try to, at least."}
{"text":"Had dinner here one night with friends. I really enjoyed the quesadilla. It's nothing unique or different but just cheesy yummy goodness with some roasted veggies.  Service was good.  I'm not a fan of beer so I can't comment on that."}
{"text":"Randomly went here on a date. The guy turned out to be a douche canoe, but I have no regrets about eating the fried pickles! Really enjoyed the dill in the breading and that they were pickle spears and not chips. Beer wise, I'd definitely go with this Gorilla thing they had on tap, it was a great light and refreshing summer brew. I probably should have drank a lot more so I could have no recollection of this playa, but it's okay, I'll just eat my feelings later.  The atmosphere was laid-back, staff was friendly and on top of things even though we came in right as a big rush hit. Prices seemed reasonable and there were other tasty sounding options on the menu. Overall I'd hit this place up again if in the neighborhood. They also have a location in Madison."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Great food. Huge portions.  Had the pretzels for an appetizer- yummy. Apricot Walnut salad for my meal very filling. No room for dessert. Overall, good food and neat atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tried Cornerstone again and was very delghted. Service was great and the salmon entree was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"A full five stars!  Nice upscale brew pub with much better than average food!  So it goes like this.  Grab a couple of fresh micro brews, I tend to prefer an IPA.  Order up an app, the fried dill pickles are amazing.  Have a great conversation while you get a fresh made salad with meat on the top. Love that salmon. With all of that and good service you have a winner!"}
{"text":"Came in from out-of-town after many years of growing up in this area. Front Street is amazing these days and I wish it was this awesome back in the Pizza King days of the 80's and 90's. I thought the clientele and atmosphere when you walked in was very comfortable if your a foodie like me who loves to try new places. I had a \"boxer brown\" tall one and it went great with their pastrami sandwich which was on special. Also loved the fresh, hand-cut fries. Very filling to say the least. On a busy night, I had great server who allowed me to sample beers before I chose the brown ale. I would suggest this place to others even though I heard this placed gets really packed when BW students are in session."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here at least two times a month. We enjoy the food and beer. The quality of service is usually really good. However, last night around 8:00pm we wanted to have a drink at the bar. When we arrived, we noticed that three of the bar stools were occupied by children under the age of about 8. Usually, bartenders will notify parents that if adults are waiting for those chairs children should not occupy those seats. Parents should know this, but these particular parents obviously did not.  One of the bartenders should have said something, but they did not. We found one bar stool at the end of the bar, my wife sat & I stood.  We waited at least 15 minutes for a bartender to take our drink order.  When no one took our order, we left and walked down to Mikes.  Happily, there were no kids sitting at their bar!   Actually, one of the guys sitting at the bar gave up his seat so that I could sit by my wife!  We will go back again because we do really enjoy the place. Hopefully, we will be able to sit at the bar without children and enjoy our beers!"}
{"text":"I've consistently received excellent food and service the multiple times I've come here.  You can count on it at this delicious local brewery in the heart of Berea.  You must get the pretzels.  Even if you never get an appetizer.  Promise me you'll do it just this once.  You won't be disappointed.  As far as the beer, if you're not sure what to order, just as for a sample first.  It's no big deal.  The staff are friendly and it's a nice, relaxing atmosphere to enjoy a tall draft, so you'll want to choose the right brew.  I agree with my fellow yelpers, the fries are delicious.  The pizzas are so tasty.  They have a perfect crispy, thin crust.  I've has a few of the sandwiches and entrees.  All of them delicious.  Two thumbs up for the Cornerstone Brewing Company."}
{"text":"Not surprised by this place's rating because it is a really great spot. I had never heard of it but that's only because I'm not from around here. For travelers, it's a convenient spot close by to the airport and a great alternative to airport hotel lounges. Great food and cozy environment plus great beer."}
{"text":"The beer keeps getting better but the service is as bad as it gets (maybe worse). Stopped in for lunch with my son, sat at the bar and although there were only three occupied tables and two other people at the bar and four or five servers plus a barman we waited an inordinately long time to be given menus. Finally a menu arrived, I was ready to order but the barman walked away. After waiting a timed five minutes I asked one of the idle servers if she could get us a drink (she was leaning on the bar right next to us with nothing to do). I was met with a blank stare. We finally got up and left without ordering.  Undaunted I returned to try their beers last night with my wife, different barman same story. We ordered a flight, he turned without acknowledging our order poured it, and slammed it on the bar in front of us and walked away. I asked him to describe the beers twice, after the second time he said \"look at the menu\". These were the only words he uttered all night. When he brought our appetizers he pushed our beers out of the way to make room, again wordlessly, and unnecessarily as the bar was empty. To say he was rude is an understatement, maybe angry would be a better word. I love beer, eat out at least twice a week, live around the corner from this place and will NEVER set foot in it again. It is a shame because the beer and food have great potential."}
{"text":"Didn't really feel like a brew pub, more like a restaurant with house brewed beers somewhere between Madison Ohio and Berea( had I owned it, it would be Beerea) the beer was good, the food was very good. The prices were very fair. The service I have to say, sitting at the bar, was a bit indifferent. The bartender definitely lacked something, perhaps it was a pleasant personality, perhaps it was the need to end his shift early on a Sunday night. I visit lots of brew pubs when I travel across country and I like to collect something from my vist. They had nothing, not even stickers. Revenue stream lost!"}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say. The pizza, burgers, fish, and wraps are all delicious. Nice ambience. Plenty of parking in the back lot if there aren't any spots available in the front or side. Very clean and the employees are kind and quick to serve you."}
{"text":"Found by accident but what a great find.  The brewery is located in a cute little college town in Berea, Ohio. My husband and I are beer snobs and we found some great micro brews here.  The Eirinn Rosanna, their St Pattys brew was excellent.  We also ordered the pretzels with dipping sauce as a snack with our beers. The regular soft pretzel was okay but the pepper jack stuffed pretzel was delish!  If in the area, we would come back for sure.  P.S.  You have that nice wood burner in the front of your bar/restaurant.  It's a shame you don't use it.  The girl seating people told us you never use it.  We think it would really add to this place. Just a thought!"}
{"text":"The best brewery/restaurant in Cleveland. I have ordered several things on the menu and everything has been spot on. The Buffalo chicken wrap is my usual go to. The beer brewed here is kick ass as well. I have tried just about all of them and thoroughly enjoyed all of them. My all time favorite beer brewed here is called the Angry Gorilla! It is a Banana flavored beer brewed in house that will knock your socks off! Do not believe any of the bad reviews about this place...they were written by idiots."}
{"text":"Good location, easy parking. Friendly staff, delicious beers, egg roll appetizer tasty. Pizza delicious and fish and chips just why you expect."}
{"text":"Food is good. Cute, casual venue. But one of the rudest servers we've ever encountered! After standing at the bar for a full 15 minutes we asked the server behind it if we could please order a drink. Her reply ... \"I can't do it right now\"! In a rude tone that matched her unbelievable response. No manager on site, another interesting disappointment. Who leaves servers like that in charge?! Unpleasant customer experience negates the quality of the food. Go down the street to Mike's instead!"}
{"text":"Okay.  My wife and I are from out of town and wanted to find something good.  Everyone's story.  At the time I started looking, Cornerstone had great reviews and a nice number of reviews to go with.  We came, we ate and we really liked.  Pretzels to start.  I had Cheeseburger soup and then onto Mahi Mahi wrap and my wife had Blackened Tacos.  Good beers, good food.  Really a good choice."}
{"text":"The staff seemed clueless, waiter and waitress took plates off the table with plenty of food but left the empty appetizer plates on the table. The \"brewery\" seemed a lot more like a bar and grill than anything else. Beer selection wasn't to bad if they weren't out of half of the selection. The salmon was over cooked. The beer onion soup tasted like a packet of salty lipton onion soup mix. Bottom line, over priced poor quality."}
{"text":"I finally had a meal at Cornerstone last weekend, after 3 or 4 attempts over the past few years. A few times it was just an obscenely long wait, and another time sat down and were then told that their credit card machine was down. We are not cash-carrying folks so we just left. Within our group of four, we tried three of the beers - Erie Blu, some sort of Hefeweizen (sorry forgot name) and FatStone, an Imperial Stout created in collaboration with Fathead's. FatStone was by far the most flavorful and the most memorable. The other two reminded me of RR Brewing Co. beers - missing the mark in terms of complexity but maybe we just chose poorly! The menu is chock full of fried goodies, burgers, sandwiches and pizzas - I guess that's to be expected from a place so close to campus. I had a caesar chicken wrap (seemingly among the healthier choices) and it was perfectly fine, just a little too much dressing. I went ahead and ordered a side of onion rings (onions are a veggie, right?) and I was so glad I did, because these things were perfect. I usually don't order onion rings, because I hate biting into one and pulling out a greasy, slimy, withered piece of onion but Cornerstone's were the opposite. My faith in onion rings is restored! The others had fish and chips, and the fish special (I think it was grilled swordfish?). Nothing was terrible, but compared to other area brewpubs, the menu lacks anything really remarkable or unique. Our waiter was knowledgeable about the beer, but wasn't the most friendly of people. Not that he was rude, just seemed completely indifferent. If you are in the mood for straight up pub food, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Consistently normal brews (limited fruits and flowers) and tasty appetizers."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Northeast Ohio, but people are brewing some fantastic beers up here. Came in late on a Friday night and found the place pretty much empty, save for a few tables and a full, small patio out front, where patrons were enjoying the cool evening and the pleasant atmosphere in Downtown Berea. We requested the sampler, and the bartender offered up the list and said that she would give us a little taste of something if we found it interesting. I looked it over and then explained that everything was interesting and that she could just charge us for the sampler. $9, which is a little high. But they have some really good, interesting beers on tap. My personal favorite was one of several seasonals they had on that night: a Belgian pale (I don't recall the name and it's not available on their web site). I really like these hybrid beers in general and have noticed them making their way into the Midwest from the West Coast more recently. This was a very good one. It was more heavily Belgian than pale, with the strong yeast taste, but that just worked to mask the heavy hops, which actually came out in the flavor much more than in the bitterness. My companion, usually not one for hops, really enjoyed this one also. This came out at 8% according to the board, but didn't taste anything near that. They have a very good IPA as well, which is especially typical of Metro Cleveland brewers. Very balanced, good body. I also really liked the heffeweizen, which I guess was also a seasonal. I don't like the wheat taste in this style typically, but really like them when they're done well. This was one that is done very well. The flavor is nothing but bananas and cloves, and the color and body are absolutely perfect. Really one of the best heffe's I've had. Then there was the red (another seasonal), which was hoppier than most reds but had a nice flavor, in general. The standard lagers should really be divided between lager and marzen. The marzen (Sandstone) really did taste like a marzen, or at least most of the ones that I've had. The lager tasted somewhat like a pilsner. The one fail here was a berry beer. I was really excited about this one, based on its description, but it came out warm and uncarbonated. The result was pretty much undrinkable. We asked the bartender about it, but she had nothing to add about it, so that's a point off. Also a point off for the early closing time: midnight on a Friday. I know it's the suburbs, but it seemed like the people there wanted to stay longer, and it limited us to only the sampler and no pints. No food review at this point because we didn't have any. I liked their menu, so I hope to be back at some point to try the food."}
{"text":"Ordinarily, I never venture anywhere past Lakewood/Cleveland.  However, I found myself at Cornerstone Brewing Company on a date and I have to say I really liked the place.  It was pretty crowded on a Saturday night, but we managed to get a small table by the door.  Service was prompt and genuinely friendly throughout the entire experience.  I rarely order salads when I go out to eat, but I was really intrigued by the apricot vinaigrette that came with the Apricot Walnut Salad.  To make it feel like a complete meal I had grilled chicken added to it and it was simply delicious.  It was a cold day, but the salad brought me back to a picnic on a warm summer day.  I also ordered the Beer Onion soup.  Believe all the hype and order it.  You'll thank me later.  Not only was the food delicious but the beer was as well...I ordered the Seven-an IPA that is a cross between a west coast and east coast IPA.  There is a difference I guess. Whatever...the important thing is that I enjoyed it.  Definitely will come back if I ever find myself in the area"}
{"text":"Nice cozy restaurant a stones throw from Baldwin Wallace.  Good Ruben sandwich, good burgers and chicken sandwiches. Much better than bar food. Will Be back if I back in town some time. Enjoyed the surroundings and pleasant staff."}
{"text":"Seated and served quickly. Friendly wait staff. Great beer served in flights of you desire. Reasonable prices. Fun atmosphere. Yummy, fresh food!"}
{"text":"I visited Cornerstone Brewing Company one evening to sample a flight of their craft beers.  I sat at the bar and I had the following brews in my flight:  Seven IPA (6.9% ABV) Sandstone Lager (5.5% ABV) Patriot Red Ale (5.5% ABV) Erie Blu (6.2 % ABV) Berea Brown Ale (5.7% ABV)  Out of the 5 ales I sampled - my favorites were the Sandstone Lager and the Berea Brown Ale. Typically, lagers and brown ales are not my favorite styles - but both of these exhibited a complexity and depth of flavor I usually don't find in these styles. Thus, I enjoyed both of them.  I also had a bowl of soup - which was decent as soups go.  #TheCornerstoneBrewingCompany"}
{"text":"I really like coming here.  Cool looking building.  Plenty of parking around.  The servers are always good.  Not super outgoing and talkative, but good.  Jay is a kick ass brewer that always pushes the envelope.  Doesn't make 14 different hoppy beers for the new beer aficionado who only think its good if they can chew hopps in it.  Try the fried pickles and pretzels!"}
{"text":"Was In the area so my wife, kids, and I stopped for dinner.  The beer french onion soup was really really good, as many other yelpers have commented.  Beers,  pesto chicken sandwich, and open face steak sandwich were good, however the chips served with them looked like what you get from the bottom of the bag.  50% chip crumble...  chicken fingers were over fried a bit and were just ok.   Big serving size for a kids order.  I would come back if I lived local, but wouldn't seek out from a city away."}
{"text":"Cornerstone has stayed in a spot where many places have failed before it - and I credit the good food, great beer, and the service. I have never had a beer here that I don't like. Seven is always a go to favorite and their seasonal beers get better each year. The wait during busy hours can be a little bit, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"I went to the Cornerstone way back when it first opened, and it's still an excellent place to eat. The bar is nice with big TVs for any sporting event and there are plenty of tables for any other occasion. More importantly, the food is very good. Homemade pizzas, handcrafted beer, and excellent appetizers just to name a few favorites. Highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Not a huge beer selection but they carry 6 or 7 very solid styles. Nothing crazy with high ABV or flavors. The Vienna Style Lager was excellent.  I will be back to knock down a few more."}
{"text":"Had the veggie quesadilla appetizer as a meal along with two beers. The Patriot Red was to happy for me. Also had their Grindstone Gold which was on the light side as described on the menu. Craft beers but not many to choose from. The quesadilla was great."}
{"text":"The Cornerstone summed up in one word delicious.    I have been here numerous times and can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet.  This place is known for its beers, but I just order the corner stone :)  They also have rootbeer on tap!    My favorite thing to get on the menu is the chicken salad sandwich: Chunky house made chicken salad served open face on a jumbo English muffin with sliced tomato, and melted cheddar cheese. and the Beer onion soup: Caramelized red and white onions in a rich beef broth highlighted by our dark lager, topped with garlic croutons, provolone and Swiss cheeses.   I have honestly tried almost everything and have never been disappointed.  They always have an off the menu daily special too which is also tempting.    Service is always pretty decent and I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I think Cornerstone has upped their brewing game since I was there last. It used to be a place where I thought more of the solid bar food than the beer, but I've been enjoying both on my recent trips. The brewery made a great stop during a recent cycling trip through the Metroparks. It's a nice little place inside and out, and we were able to enjoy a patio space in our scary Lycra. The beers are tasty, the atmosphere is good, and while the menu is not the most imaginative in Cleveland, it's executed well. This is a very nice option in Berea."}
{"text":"Cornerstone is a surprisingly classy restaurant/bar for more or less being on a college campus (Baldwin-Wallace).  I'm not big on beer, but I know that those who are are very satisfied with the specialty beers brewed here.  Me, I'm just in love with their deep fried pickles (along with any other appetizers/entrees I've tried here)."}
{"text":"Cornerstone took a while to grow on me. I love the atmosphere here, right near B-W's campus it is a great place to see people and have a good night. Most of the food is ok but not too great. The main draw is their beer which tends to be very good and brewed on the premises."}
{"text":"I went here on a lark with a friend of mine. We were those people, coming in one hour before the kitchen closed.   The ambience of the place is a little more upscale, but still casual. Lots of exposed brick and faux limestone or granite surfaces, plus fairly modern lighting. Points for keeping your lights up late at night; it was nice to not have to fumble in the dark, and for some reason, it felt more like home.   The beer was decent. I had a session rye ale, which was honestly sort of mediocre. My next beer was a Harry Porter, which was lovely and delicious.   The food was good, but nothing to write home about. Granted, it may have been my fault for coming in so late, but apparently my idea of medium is vastly different than theirs, since my steak was so raw I had to coax it back onto my plate with some grain and a carrot. All kidding aside, it was a good restaurant cut. The fries were impeccable, though.  What's really keeping it out of the five-star range was the service. I'm not a smartphone-gazer, serial instagrammer, or the sort of person who becomes upset when he has a thought and the waiter isn't around, but at times I sort of felt ignored and like a nuisance. This is especially nitpicking, but the waitress we had said she didn't drink beer and couldn't provide any suggestions; I would feel like a brewpub would want servers who were fluent in beer.  All in all, it was competently executed and a good, solid entry into a burgeoning market. There's room to improve, but there is a significant foundation."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere for a small micro brewery. Food is good and beer is a wonderful value, good and not expensive like you see downtown. Great place to grab a drink with some friends and have a few tall boys. The lighting make you feel relaxed, this place would be my \" Cheers\" bar of Berea, Ohio.   In comparison to other Berea bars, it blows Bar 107 out of the water."}
{"text":"Stopped up here with a few friends to enjoy some tasty food and beer-y goodness. I didn't get to taste the beer this time but I was told by my very trustworthy dinner company that it was delicious. They ordered a few different ones so it must have been good.  For dinner I had the chipotle steak wrap. Wow! I'm usually a chicken wrap kind of woman but I think I have been swayed to the other side. It had a cheddar jalapeño tortilla and chipotle ranch with some pico de gallo. The whole thing was a steak fiesta in my mouth! Was that weird? Eh, it's fine. Nom nom. Service was good and I shall return to try the potato skin egg rolls. Obviously, I mean how good does that sound?"}
{"text":"Went in here Sunday afternoon at 2:30pm. My wife and I sat at bar. Nearly 10 minutes went by no one approached us. It looked like the barmaid was busy with the cash register. The two servers saw us as did the two cooks. No one greeted us or even acknowledged us. A simple \"someone will be right with you\" would have done the trick. The place was pretty empty, I hope the owner has a video and watches it. We left and even then no one said boo. I guess they don't need the business."}
{"text":"Wonderful date night with my teenage daughter. Lovely evening to sit outside, and the service was fantastic - attentive but not overbearing. Jonathan was delightful. Excellent beers, and food (Three Cheese Pesto Pizza & Ahi Tuna Wrap), and atmosphere. Weary from a full day's travel, otherwise we would have tried more! She'll be in town longer than I, and I will wager that she will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"We go back about once a year, and have been since they opened.  Things seem to have gotten better, food is above decent, but still far from great.  The beers are average as well, nothing special, nothing adventurous, no big flavors."}
{"text":"Great little place in Berea by the fountain! I went there on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't too packed. Got the Sicilian Pizza with a garden salad. Very good! Pizza tasted really fresh and the sauce was delicious. I had the Erie Blu and while it seemed a little funky at first, the taste got better after the third sip and I wanted to order another one! Will be back for sure! Only downfall was limited service... Seemed like we had to wait nearly 10 minutes before a waiter even came to ask is what we wanted to drink... Afterwards it was fine though."}
{"text":"I was at Baldwin Wallace listening to an astronomy lecture about the Sounds of the Cosmos. Afterwards a couple of us went to The Cornerstone Brewing Company. It was a Friday night around 9:30pm, pretty busy but we were able to get a table right away. It took 20mins for a server to finally come over and take our orders. Our beers and food came pretty quickly. I got cheese-y fries and a beer. If someone suggested it, I would go again but if it was up to me I would want to try a new restaurant. It did not grab me."}
{"text":"So, in my quest for a pumpkin beer in Berea last night, we stumbled into Cornerstone. No such luck, so I \"settled\" for the Berea Brown Ale. No disappointment here! What a cute place for good conversation with an old friend. Now, I've been here a few times and don't really remember what I've tried (ahem... the beer is delicious!), but the menu looks great! The atmosphere was that of a typical pub, and the service was quick and helpful. Not too shabby guys."}
{"text":"Cornerstone is an adorable pub tucked into Berea. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by the service, food and not so cold beer. I had the Caesar wrap. It was a-okay. Nothing memorable and a tad on the dry side. With other good options in the area, I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great little local place with great food and craft brews. Fun atmosphere but can be a little loud at times."}
{"text":"The meal tonight! Apricot walnut Salad- what a nice dressing over greens, walnuts, bleu cheese and dried apricots.  The entree pretzel covered chicken was out of this world!! A tasty sauce complimented the meal, fresh veggies served hot and perfect!!!  A nice selection of beer in a flight... Rocket Cow- Yes!!!"}
{"text":"I spent a few hours after work here today. Being the hop head that I am, I ordered the Seven which is dubbed as a West Coast style IPA with an east coast flavor. Very hoppy front end that smoothed into a very enjoyable IPA. While there, I was able to meet Jay, the head brewer. It was slow in the bar area, so he was able to spend at least an hour talking with me about craft beer and brewing in general. Couldn't ask for a better experience. Jay runs a tight ship and could be seen checking on the registers and such. I also sampled every other beer they had on tap. I left with a newfound appreciation for every style they offered. When you become a hop chaser, other styles seem to fall by the wayside and you can get into a rut. I took this opportunity and sampled at least 8 other styles of beer and thoroughly enjoyed them all. Rowan and Grindstone were favorites, but each had a uniqueness that allowed them to be very enjoyable.   Cornerstone harkens back to the time where neighborhoods had their own beer and breweries. This place is a a fine example of this. They don't distribute, they brew for their patrons and their local neighborhood.  The bar is an English style pub design. It's a dark, cozy atmosphere with friendly barkeeps. Very comfortable and friendly. They also have an outdoor seating area!   If you live in Berea or close by, this place is worth a visit. Jay has been in the craft beer industry for 7+ years and has a great passion for his beer and it shows. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is decent bar food, but nothing to write home about. Deep fried pickles are pretty tasty. I have been there five times over the past two years. I was a tad unimpressed with beer selection. Their IPA \"Seven\" is average. The most consistent accommodation I received over the 5 times was the slow service. Plan on waiting awhile to order anything. I am not sure if they need more people or what. Service is part of the equation for a successful restaurant to be prosperous. If you haven't been here though, I would still try it out. If you're not a fan , the brew kettle and fatheads are right around the corner."}
{"text":"I've been going out of my way to frequent this place for some reason the past few months.  I haven't ever had a beer here that I didn't like, however make sure you look at the ABV and order food accordingly.  One appetizer split between three people and three Arrogant Bastards split between myself are not too good of a combo.  Aside from that, I haven't had a bad meal.  I've tried a couple of their pizzas, which are light(er) and nice for sharing.  I've also had a handful of their apps, with the fried pickles being my favorite (and I don't like pickles, at all) and their frequent special of pretzels and cheese being a cardiac arresting second.  Buffalo egg rolls cut in edible slices really put me over the edge as well.  Alright, I like junk food, got it?   Their Beer Onion Soup (French Onion) is outta this MSG filled world.  Garlic croutons top this savory lager broth before it is smothered with different white cheeses.  My first time trying this soup, I knew it was a mistake.  Want more now.  I've always had good service and just a short wait; even on weekends.   Highly recommended local establishment.  In the triangle of 'Downtown Berea'."}
{"text":"This is another one of those places that I am sure I am missing out on because I don't drink.  From what I hear, the beers brewed at Cornerstone are really good and definitely worth checking out, but I can't speak to that from personal experience.   As to the rest of what Cornerstone has to offer, I can say that it's not a bad place to go.  The food tends to be of the bar food variety - burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, etc.   Whenever I've eaten there I've been happy with my meal, even if nothing stands out as spectacular.  I take that back, the fries are actually very good - they're seasoned and very crispy.  The atmosphere is a little loud - lots of reflective surfaces have that effect, but it's also spacious and clean, which is nice.   The service has been reliably good, and while the prices might be a little steep for a lunch, they are very reasonable for a dinner.  If you're in the neighborhood, it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Cornerstone brews up some good beer, and the food is reliably tasty.  I always enjoy the Three Pigs pizza."}
{"text":"Average service, good beer, mediocre food. Portions were large.   French onion Soup was very bland. Salad was large but rather boring."}
{"text":"Been coming down to Berea every two months or so since moving to Lakewood eight years ago. Mostly to walk dog. In all that time, this brewery sat there, beckoning a visit. And I never did. Why? Because I am a low rent Lake County native who drinks Genny Cream Ale(Creme Ale if you're nastee) andveats Burger King like it's school lunch.   This particular Friday night found wife, dog, and I in the area. Finally, FINALLY went in. Gorgeous space. Small, but somehow more rewarding than the warehouse space of a Willoughby Brewing or Fathead's. Ordered veggie quesadilla for wife, fish n chips for me and, oh, also a growler Sandstone for uh...the dog. food was phenomenal. Spot fucking on. Got the growler home and sipped that sweet quarry nectar for two days.   A true gem in the brewery crown of Cleveland. Doesn't get as much pub as Glbc, Beer Engine, etc, but totes deserves it."}
{"text":"Our server was very friendly and the place had a nice lively atmosphere. The craft brews were good quality the grindstone was light with a nice taste. The Sandstone had nice color and a good body to it.   Prices were reasonable and the 1/2 Lb burger was cooked exactly how I ordered it. O-Rings were just ok not the best I've ever had though and I have to say the same for the fried pickle spears good but not great.   I am sure there are better appetizers on the menu, but by no means don't take these two comments as a don't go because if I get back in the area I would stop again because I want to try one of the pizzas.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I only leave bad reviews in hopes it will help the business. I am a server myself so give way more slack.. maybe server was having a bad day, or kitchen was unprepared.. idk but all around from service to food it was bad. Husband wanted to get up and leave before asking our serving if she could finally take our order.. burger, Reuben, pizza all half eaten and left behind! Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Excellent good and portions samples flight of beers very tasty.  Staff was very friendly highly recommended"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a thoroughly pleasant evening.   The service was attentive. The atmosphere was comfortable and local.  Food was outstanding.  Had the Apricot Walnut Salad with Tuna.  It was perfect in the way the flavors came together."}
{"text":"Love Cornerstone! Everything I have had here is amazing, it's hard to even pick a favorite! You receive pretty big portions of food for the price you pay. The atmosphere is really nice and comfortable. The staff and service is exceptional."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is energetic, very loud, fun, the food is really well priced nothing going over $20 high quality meals, beers are pretty decent and fresh."}
{"text":"Cornerstone is as good as it gets for a microbrewery that serves food. All of the food is completely standard bar food for Cleveland. Nothing is going to knock your socks off, but it is all cooked very well. Service is fast and clean.  The real star of the show are the beers. They are worthy of a separate review, actually.  Cornerstone moves with the seasons, and there is always some new brew to taste. I've never had a brew that I didn't enjoy. Occasionally, I'll have a negative initial reaction to a beer. For instance, I often wish their stouts were, well, stoutier. But after a few more tastes, the bigger picture emerges, and by the end of the glass, I'm hooked.   There is no better place to pull up a stool and watch a Browns game while stimulating your taste buds. This space has a long history of failed businesses. It has been an Arabica, and plenty of other things. Cornerstone has lasted a long time, and it deserves to be there for years to come!"}
{"text":"Cornerstone ... An adorable suburban brewpub in the quaint \"olde timey\" section of Berea.  The beer is tasty, the food is good and the service is fairly friendly. You can't go wrong.  Favorite beer tasted: The Rusty Pheasant. A seasonal rye beer full of toasty, malty flavor.  Favorite food tasted: The deep fried pickles. As good as I've had. SUPER crispy with an almost jagged crust.   Will definitely be back ... someday."}
{"text":"Beer onion soup was as good as described in the other reviews, good starter. Cornerstone burger was very good, cooked perfect(medium rare) and all of one half pound. Fries and onion rings were delicious as well. Wish we would have spit the burgers, rolling out of here and didn't finish half burger and fries."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp. I came to this place tonight wanting to try a couple different beers.I wasn't coming to a brewery for a great meal but some tasty beverages and I was not disappointed. I have to compliment Jonathan the bartender as I ordered an IPA that warned that it was serious and bitter. It was very good but I only wanted one and proceeded to order a Brown Ale, but Jonathan noticed and asked me to sample a beer they called 3 1/2 another IPA and WOW was he spot on. What a great time. Not very conversational but he recommended the fresh cut Corn Beef and the Rueben and was spot on. I really enjoyed this place. The beer and casual pub food was great. Everyone said to try the pretzels but I have to say the beer onion soup was fantastic."}
{"text":"Can you believe I am a Cleveland native and today was my first visit to Cornerstone, why I am asking myself?  This place has a great vibe from the minute you walk in the front door. The decor is perfect for a college town bar/pub. And, the food was great. My husband loved his burger and my apricot salad was perfect.   Even if the food were mediocre, which let me be clear, it is ABOVE average, I think I would return because of the friendly staff. Our server Brian was probably as close to perfect of a waiter you can get.  Everyone in the place had smiles.    In addition to excellent food, they also brew their own beer and had an extensive list to choose from including some seasonals. I opted for a nice dark beer at our waiter Brian's suggestion and I wasn't disappointed, wonderful body and great robust taste!  There were 8 of us in our group and every one agreed we would return!"}
