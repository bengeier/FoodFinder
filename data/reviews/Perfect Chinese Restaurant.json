{"text":"\"Perfect\"--oh, the irony.  I will be fair; the food is decent, but the service (or sometimes lack thereof) is horrible.  The waiters and waitresses are rude.  Service is slow and being ignored is not uncommon. I'm a picky eater, so sometimes, it might take a long time for me to come across a dish I really like during yumcha.  It is possible that I might never come across anything I like to eat because what they decide to make that day is what you get to eat.  I guess this is not the type of place you want to go to if you're in a hurry and you're a picky eater.  I just wished they let us choose the dimsum from a menu.  Dinner is decent, but I really don't recommend this place for yumcha."}
{"text":"Favorite 24 hour dimsum place.  Friendly staffs.  U have to be early othewise waiting period will be about an hour to get you seated.  You can either ask for a share table or your own which ever comes first.  Shu mai, ha kau, beef tripe, bbq pork bun, etc. are so delicious.  Everything they served are 5 stars."}
{"text":"Perfect place to come for Chinese food at 3am after you've had a night out. The crowd is a little sketchy at times but it's nothing to worry about."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant has been around for at least 25+ years.   During my younger days I remember coming here to eat in the middle of the night (the only place that was 24hrs back than).  Quality of food is just as bad now,  as it was before lol.    I shouldn't be that mean... for the price you pay, it is actually not that bad.  If you order $20 of food before tax, you get a whole peking duck for $9.99 (it was $7.99 before).  But the duck is really really fat and those little pancakes that usually comes with the duck is really really thick. No choice in how you want the second course of duck.  It comes cut up into pieces for you (other places will generally allow you to have lettuce wrap with it).  We also order a plate of fried oyster and a plate of veggies.   Oyster was really bad, can't say anything good about it ($14.95 too).  The veggie was veggie.   Meal came with free soup and a bowl of dessert (red bean).  All in all,  $42.88 for two.  Will I come back... not anymore.  I have gave this place business on and off for the past 20 years (on average, about twice a year for the latter half of the 20).  It was never as bad as today's meal was.  Not sure what happen."}
{"text":"Food is great. The service is standard Chinese restaurant service...which is pretty poor. It's great to go eat after a club. It's good that it's open all the time. Be careful when you do takeout because they put the food in the containers that is too hot and too spicy and so it melts the containers and you're eating chemicals after. Especially Hot and Sour Soup, do not do takeout. I noticed the melting of the container after being half way done. Otherwise good food."}
{"text":"The rating I gave was solely based on the food - it's authentic, always fresh and delicious. The price is definitely much better during regular dim sum hours, but it's not bad during the non-regular hours. Even though I have to drive half an hour to this destination, it's definitely a treat I look forward to.  Now onto the bad.   1) horrible service. No smiles or any niceties, the mostly male waiters look like they're really miserable being there.  They're slow to get to little \"free\" extras - case in point, if you want to buy a coke, it'll be there in 1 minute; want water/  soy sauce/ hot sauce? it may be there 2-10 minutes, longer, or never, even after a few reminders. some dishes are simply thrown onto the table, with no announcement of what it is. last time there, we got our dessert right after ordering, and the food came much much later... you don't get one assigned server for each table, so multiple randoms come up to your table and serve you - in return no one alone feels responsible to give you a pleasant dining experience. I'm actually pretty used to the \"cheap food low service\" mentality of chinese cuisine, but this one place really stood out to me.  2) waiting times. there always seems to be a huge line around the weekends, and it's chaotic. No person seems to man the waiting line, and it was impossible to get a waiting number or an update on the waiting times. I guess this goes in line with the level of service they provide.  All in all, go for the food, don't go during weekend lunch hours, and go in knowing that you're not there for their stellar service."}
{"text":"Very good authentic food at an amzing price. Dim sum is not always consistent though, and you may end up waiting a long time for something you want."}
{"text":"Came for supper. Really great food. Good value, good portion's and the service was good."}
{"text":"I love this place even though you have to wait an hour to eat on weekends! The place is always packed! Love all the seafood choices and the other goodies they have.   I'll always come here when I'm in Scarborough for some fried goodies!"}
{"text":"service sucks. period. we have a group of 13 - they expected us to all sit in one table - when we requested two tables - the waitress push back saying no and we all can squeeze together...not satisfied with this of course we requested again unitl we had to ask for management approval.. even though there are several empty tables next to us. we had to ask for utensils and water several times...food was average"}
{"text":"This is my staple place to eat whenever its pass midnight and I need to have a nice fill. I have been here with my gf as many times or more like Roger Federer making it to the finals of a Grand Slam!   Their wait time for dim sum is crazy loooonnggg, but they do have quite a variety of selection for it to make up the wait. Plus its not too bad in price...$1.70 per dish, unless you go special on them. I would say their staple dish that really is consistent and really good compared to other places is their 'Siu Mai'. I dunno why, but its just really good when I splash it in their chili sauce paste!  Whenever I come to eat late-night supper here, we would order the siu mai, eggplant, beancurd oyster skin, ha-gau, and steam oyster with garlic or black bean sauce.  Sometimes we'll try their rice noodle with chicken and pepper on black bean sauce...This one can get quite filling for two ppl. We also get their sizzling scallop with egg tofu! This one is for tofu lover's who likes diff texture and taste of tofu.  We also try the 'Dau Miu' which is steam veggie with garlic, or the scrambled egg with shrimp...  Luckily for me so far, I have not experienced getting flies or bugs on my food like other fellow Yelpers...  Pro of coming here to eat: 1) 24hrs 2) Not too expensive on price for food 3) Close to my area in scarb  Con of coming here to eat: 1) Hit and Miss with service 2) Mostly do not ice on water 3) Waiters are a bit rude at times depends which one you have helping you  Its only 3 stars based on overall consistency from my visit on dim sum time and supper time. Take your chances!"}
{"text":"Siu long bao often times have no soup in them and if they did not all leak out, it tends to be quite bland. Buns are very dry and are clearly microwaved. Waiters also have no problem shouting out loud in Cantonese, \"I forgot to take it out of the microwave\" to other waiters across the dining room after being asked about food by a table of non-asians. These are just a few descriptions of the mediocre food at this establishment.   I suppose I can't really expect too much from the place at 2am in the morning and the cheap price. Just a taste of the food is enough to understand an idea of why the place is usually filled with non-asian customers during normal dinner and late night hours. It's not like there is much else to choose from if I want dim sum late at night though. Overall, I'd only give this place 2 stars for food but give them an extra for the 24 hours service."}
{"text":"This place is the antithesis of a hit and miss restaurant.  The best time to go is at lunch time, even if it is 24 hours. If you go for dinner, and you end up in the 'b' room and not in the main dining area, you end up waiting and the service staff is very disinterested.  At lunch, the selection of dim sum is significantly better, rather than what they have at night.  Best bets are the Ha Gow, Shu Mai, bbq pork buns, deep fried squid and chicken wings...the rice noodles are outstanding...when they have them !  This is worth checking out and it's full of Asian locals. We love it when we need a fix, but we've got to stop going after 3 in the afternoon.  PS: the price is right."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week with my boyfriend and we love it.   The service absolutely sucks, but when you go there often, they remember you and it's way better.  We are normally there a Friday or Saturday at 1am and we get seated right away..definitely not as \"packed\" as the other reviews I have read. We also get take out if we want to be quick and head home. Other than Markham Station (the only other 24 hour place in Scarborough), this is always my choice!!   Our regular order is har gow, sui mai (I hope I spelled that right), bbq pork, sweet and sour chicken, shrimp spring rolls, corn and crab soup or sweet and sour soup depending on our mood, and satay beef. They are all delish!!! :) oh, don't forget hot sauce for the dim sum!! The bang for your buck is definitely worth it as long as you know what to order.   We have tried their garlic wings, mixed fried rice, and many other dishes but they really just don't stand out. A ton of people order the chicken feet which I just can not get myself to try..eww!   Parking is scarce, so we normally park as soon as we turn in the drive and than walk to the door. It is good for kids, families and couples..sometimes you will get a dirty dish or dirty cutlery but you can ask them for another - no point in getting upset about it..it seriously happens at every restaurant once in a while!!"}
{"text":"Our family and relatives used to come here very often for dinner and, especially for dimsum. It has one of the best prices in Toronto and the food is one of the better ones as well for its price. Now there are so many people and is always a long wait unless we come before peak hours. They seem to be one of the most popular dimsum places in Toronto that serves a diverse number of ethnic groups compared to many other places I've been to, which is quite nice to see. Perhaps it's because they serve dimsum on pushing carts instead of a menu so guests can see what exactly is ready to eat without having to know any Chinese."}
{"text":"One of my Dad's favourite Dim Sum places.  So we're not originally from Toronto and so when my Dad use to drive us all to Toronto, we'd usually stay in Chinatown to grab dim sum. But after our favourite downtown place started going downhill, it was time that my dad found a new favourite place. In comes Perfect Chinese Restaurant. Not sure how he discovered it, but he's been a fan ever since.  The usual suspects are good - har gow, sui mei, chung fun, ho fun, deep fried squid tenticles, all very yummy as is the fried turnip pancake. We've also been for dinner, the crab dishes are good, as is the peking duck.  The parking is bad. So be prepared for it. Also, if you go during peak dim sum times on the weekend, expect to wait in the very crowded little entry way into the restaurant.   My dad, is a simple man, knows what he likes and sticks to it. So despite going to university downtown, he'd pick me up there, and take me out to Scarborough just for some Perfect. Pretty ridiculous because it meant then driving me back downtown and then haul it back to the 400 to go home!"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short and simple. I've been to this place two times now.   I love dim sum, so I ordered from their dim sum menu. I'm sad to say that their dim sum is a disappointment: flavourless, and the shrimp dim sum just falls apart before you get to your mouth.   I ordered a pork and shrimp noodle dish as well - man these people are stingy to the max. There were traces of pork and shrimp in this dish!   Needless to say I won't be coming here again. My boyfriend and I payed 40$ including tip, for 4 orders of dim sum and a main dish. Expensive and not worth it."}
{"text":"THE WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!! my friends and i went there recently and the food we had were filthy, the service was really terrible and the table and seats were dirty. I have never went to a place where we had a waiter who didn't do anything helpful. If i could give this place zero stars i would. Honestly, this place looks decent but looks can be deceiving.  1) Service - as soon as we walked in we got ignored, we sat down to order, the table was dirty and we asked the waiter about the table he just said its nothing and walked away. My friends and i didn't want to make a big commotion so we just cleaned the table ourselves. When we tried to order, the waiter was very impatient and looked like he wanted to kill himself. He wouldn't even give us time to order properly. When we finally made the order it took over half an hour for our food to arrive. They did a mistake on my friends order and kept on telling us that it was our fault. In the end, he got his order changed but the waiter was extremely mad. Through the whole thing was being very polite. As soon as i was eating i noticed a piece of hair in my food. My cousin also had a piece of hair which was atleast 4 inches long wrapped onto a piece of chicken. I also had hair in my water. When i asked them about it they refused to do anything about it. They were in denial that it was from them and told us we had to pay. This is when i stopped being mr. nice guy and told them we aint paying. Especially when we ate food that had hair and other filth. Long story short, cops were involved and in the end i was forced to pay but the cops were on our side. Well that's what they said, they just told us to make a report. These place had the worst service ever and the food was dry as hell. I would not recommend anyone to come down here to eat at all. There's many more better places out there u just got to look. I have reported this to a health inspector and i wouldn't be surprised if this place gets closed down."}
{"text":"I have retracted my previous rating down to 1 star due to a recent  experience that really put a bad taste in my mouth - pun intended. I live downtown but have stopped by once before. I was visiting my parents in Scarborough and thought the food was decent and price was right so I didn't hesitate to place an order over the phone for pick up on my way home (actually I placed my order online initially, waited for a phone call but received none, called them and was told they were having some server issues or whatever...). I ordered 2 noodle soups and 5 dim sums -  went to pick it up, it was ready when I got there, I paid and left. So far so good. Except when I got home, I realized they forgot my BBQ pork buns. Damn, I was really craving for them too. No big deal, it happens, I call them up and let them know. Lady confirms my phone number and order and tells me I have two options: 1. Come back to the restaurant so they can credit my card back, or 2. They will save the $2.60+tax credit under my name so I can just redeem it when I come back...BUT WITHIN 1 MONTH. This whole time she hasn't apologized ONCE. So I told her so, and that 1. I'm all the way downtown I'm not going back (apparently their machine is old and they can't credit me back without my physical card...), and 2. Why does the so called credit have to be redeemed WITHIN 1 MONTH or it expires? DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. I wonder if it was the other way around, and they undercharge me, would they drive all the way downtown for me to pay? They can't even get their online orders right, what ensures me I will have a credit on my name if and when I come back? I am the customer who was inconvenienced and received no empathy or apology to begin with, why must they inconvenience me further? Truth be told, it was only $3, but man what a difference poor customer service makes regardless of monetary value.   Had my issue been resolved in a better manner, I would absolutely recommend this place to everyone I know. I mean they're open 24 hours!    But I guess when it's too good to be true, it probably is.  ETA: After reading other reviews, this place sounds like a restaurant from hell! Accusing customers of graffiti on walls?! Intentional hairs placed in your food?! Cops being involved?! WTF someone please give these people a reality show. I will now avoid going here. If you can, GO TO CONGEE STAR at Don Mills/ Eglinton instead. Great service, great food and also cheap!"}
{"text":"Service sucks but the food is great. 24 hour dim sum and good dishes.  Real authentic Chinese food.  There are so many places for good chinese in Toronto, this is usually the spot I choose."}
{"text":"WORST RESTAURANT EVER! Must have changed management cause now there is a charge for tea (server did not notify us), no fortune cookies when paying the bill, and no credit under 20$. No sign letting the customer know of the cash policy and when confronted, the manager did not say anything except rudely stating that they \"don't need a sign\" after multiple attempts to an answer. Spring roll was cold and dishes took forever to come out despite it being 8am and pretty much empty. Perfect was always shady with poor service but today just took it to another level. I won't be visiting this place ever again and I don't recommend anyone else either."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good... prices are extremely reasonable! The staff isn't the friendliest but everything else about the restaurant overlooks the bad attitude given from staff. It's still five stars! I go there to order 20 bucks of food (often good portions) and then pay another 10 bucks for a Beijing roadted duck, which is often cooked pretty well. I've been to this restaurant more than 10 times and still counting! The most attractive things about this restaurant is that the soup they serve you before your meal is free and really good, and that they also offer free dessert. Anyway, I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for southern chinese food!"}
{"text":"Great place for dimsum. The place can get loud at times though, but I've always enjoyed my visits. They have a good variety of dimsums."}
{"text":"Dim Sum is a la cart. Place is spacious and the decor is very much like your average chinese resto, Dim Sum was great, but the atmosphere was very drabby. If you come for the food, it's great!"}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday during their anniversary special. My husband and I have never experienced such horrible service. We have never be so rushed. We were given the bill which we never asked for. Right after we paid for the bill, my wife went to the bathroom and they started to clear the table and changed the table before we even left. The people who did all this was even the manager. We will never return to eat here again. I would give this place 0 stars if i could."}
{"text":"Been to many dimsum place... but still Perfect is the best in food taste, service, variety and the price....   Imagine $1.80 per dimsum order just a 10cents increase from $1.70 last year.  If you go there in between 10am  to 4pm you also get offers for other dishes  at a low price.   It's a long wait during weekends but it's worth the wait.... the best place ever to have dimsum....  :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service!! If you can find another restaurant, do it. I went with a group of friends around 10:30pm and the room wasn't packed, surprisingly! We had a 30 minute wait before someone took our order and every time we wanted to get water, food, or even the  bill we had to wait a ridiculous amount of time. And we received stale rice and mediocre food. We often had to ask our waiter about our food because he kept getting the quantities we ordered wrong! We asked for water and that never came. We often tried to make eye contact and call out to the waiters as they passed by, but we were completely ignored even after making direct eye contact. Often I saw our waiter just wondering the room not doing anything. He was definitely not attentive. Finally it was time to pay the bill and we all agreed that the service was way too bad for a tip, so after paying the waiter looks at the bill and says, \"There's no tip, why?\" To which we reply, \"The service was bad.\"  Without giving us a chance to explain why, the waiter grabs the credit machine and says, \"why'd you even come here then.\" He proceed to mutter stuff as he made his way to the back room. (Well believe me if I knew that I was going to get horrendous service and mediocre food I wouldn't of wasted any money here.) The waiter then proceeds to stare us down as we leave the restaurant. This waiters tone of voice and attitude was piggish and because of this experience I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone. My friends and I will never consider eating at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"The dishes are okay. There is a moderate selection at lunch, with vegetarian dishes as well. The food is slightly better than the food they sell at the food courts in Chinese supermarkets. It's very busy during brunch time, so don't expect the waiters to be polite like in western restaurants."}
{"text":"Good dim sum and really good prices! At $1.80 a dish, I don't think I can find something like that anywhere else. We were a party of 4 and were pretty filled up afterwards. Portions are large for the price and service was decent enough. Bill came to be just under $30 (tax+tip included) which I found very reasonable. Will be back if I'm ever in the Scarborough area again."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5 If you want a no-frills meal with the family and you live in the area, Perfect is the go-to Chinese restaurant for many in the area. We frequently see non-Asians eating here too, and it's a healthy mix of young and old. They have $3 special full-size dishes if you reach a certain price point, I believe $20.  Verdict: if you want authentic Chinese style cooking, then come here, but not with important guests because it's not such a fancy restaurant with impeccable service!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is average. Nothing popped really but there was one dish that stood out from the rest. Whenever my family comes to Toronto, we would pass this place, but then one day, we decided to give them a try. It was around noon time and a Saturday, meaning LOTS of people were waiting to be seated. When we got there, we had to wait awhile. Fast forward, we were seated then the carts went around. We got the usual, har gao, shumai, pork buns, egg tarts, etc... The shumai and har gao lacked flavor and the pork buns had a lot of the fat from the meat... We ordered some things off a menu, but the only thing I remembered was this spicy, and maybe fried, pork. I think that was one of the only dishes that I enjoyed from this restaurant. Next time, I think I'll only come back for those...."}
{"text":"Most of the time i go here to have dim sum.  The food is average at best and i find the prices pretty fair.  Dim Sum on the weekends...SO BUSY..so prepare to wait at least 30 min.  I would come back cause i like their dim sum and their variety BUT the choices last time i went was poor.  The carts kept going around in circles with the same food item for quite a long time.  Late night chinese rules here."}
{"text":"Can't understand why the ratings are so low here.  I live in the US, and every year I come back, I have to go here.  The chinese fried chicken, sweet and sour pork, and peking duck are to die for.  Very inexpensive with decent decor.  Definitely get your bang for your buck.  Wish I had a restaurant like this in the US."}
{"text":"Worst at their peak times.  All rude people, customers, and employees. Food isn't even worth the hassle. It's literally Chinese junk food, oil and grease."}
{"text":"I don't understand why so many bad reviews...personally I don't like this place much but my family always goes there on weekends to have a family dinner and it does it job. My family is always satisfied leaving this restaurant. Read on to find out why.  The prices are good I suppose. I'm not sure if this offer is still on but before if you ordered $25 or something worth of food, you get a Peking duck for only $20 (not sure about the exact prices as it was my relatives paying and didn't pay attention, but got the impression it was a really good deal).  I didn't notice bad service as said in other reviews. My stepdad always asks for an extra dish of sauce for the Peking duck because he practially inhales that sauce lol and the sauce always gets to us quick. Or if it doesn't we just ask another person and it comes. Same with asking for paper napkins. Always comes quick and they give us a whole bunch of napkins.  Washrooms aren't the cleanest but hey washrooms in malls and TTCs are horrible too, so this is not a unique thing.   I've never found hair or bugs in my food.  This place is always really busy each weekend we go there. Before it was probably because of the Peking duck offer, but in general because of low prices I suppose.  I didn't comment on the quality of food because I'd be biased. Personally I just plain don't like Chinese restaurants, food contains too much oil for me to stomach, makes me feel nauseous. I'd rather eat sushi.  :)  Overall decent. Decent service, decent food, cheap food, dirty washrooms, but don't except too much in Chinese restaurants. Except for the more modern Chinese restaurants many Chinese restaurants are more about the value of/and the food than the service."}
{"text":"Decent food. Terrible service.   Waiters and waitresses regularly ignore you and serve their favourite customers. Avoid this place if you want to be treated like a human being. Come if you can stomach below average food and be treated like garbage.  This is a pretentious restaurant and charge you extra just to sit their \"VIP\" room. What a steaming load!"}
{"text":"I actually agree with one of the previous reviewers...there should be an option for negative stars. I was at Perfect Chinese Restaurant last night for dinner with my family, and I can honestly say it was THE single most WORST dining experience I have ever experienced. The food was sub-par, and the service was totally unacceptable.   We ordered a set dinner for 6, two additional dishes, chicken and salted fish fried rice, and the peking duck. Upon our arrival, I was not impressed, as their chairs were stained, and very unappetizing. Their lazy susan was also wet (I found out why later, as i observed the waiters pour water onto them to \"clean\" them after another party left). One of the dishes had an unidentifiable object stuck onto it.  First the soup arrived. It was just plopped down in the middle of the table. Suffice it to say, we were not served and had to serve ourselves. Then our dishes arrived one by one. Now, one would expect the peking duck to be served immediately after the soup, but that did not happen. Everything arrived BUT the duck. We asked for several pairs of communal chopsticks (which incidentally never arrived throughout the duration of the meal). We finally asked about the peking duck, and we found out the order was missed (how is that possible, when we didn't order much, and they had an electronic ordering system?) Oddly enough, all the other dishes we'd ordered which did not have promotional pricing, arrived.   The food itself was not very good, as most of the dishes arrived room temperature (lukewarm is generous). The peking duck that arrived at the end of the meal was the blandest and driest piece of meat any one of us had ever had the misfortune of tasting. The wrap was extremely thick and extremely small (our guess is that they are several gyoza wrappers stacked on top of each other). I almost forgot to mention that the waiter just plopped the dish of duck on the table (not even the lazy susan, since he seemed to be in a terrible hurry to torture the next table with his poor service), expecting us to figure out everyone ourselves. The duck (not for the wraps) did not come with any sauce, and the blandness and lack of moisture were overwhelming.   Now, onto the service. The failure to bring communal chopsticks and to serve us soup was the least of our concerns. NO ONE, and I repeat, NO ONE refilled our tea. We were so thirsty, my dad had to refill it himself. When he went to the station, there were two waiters there, but they did not acknowledge him at all. This is totally unacceptable, as I'm sure many many people would agree. All the dishes were just plopped onto our table (not just by the waiters, but also other servers from the kitchen). When we asked for the bill, the waiter DID surprisingly pour the dessert for us, but only because he needed an opportunity to make snide comments to us about us having to refill our tea ourselves. It seemed like a poorly disguised attempt at fishing for tips, but at that point, we just wanted to get out of that place pronto. He brought us the bill, but my  mom had already paid.   Also regarding the waiters, all of them are in their 50s, perhaps coincidentally with recent deaths in their families. I cannot fathom why else their service would be so poor, or why they did not smile at all. The feeling I got throughout the meal was that not one of the waiters could wait 'til they got out of that place.   I would encourage every reader to pay this restaurant a visit, since only will first-hand experience convince you that their service was truly that poor. As diners in the Scarborough/Markham area looking for Chinese food, there are wayyyy better options, both taste-wise and of course service-wise (as it is not possible for service to be worse). In fact, several days ago, we'd visited the Pearl Chinese Restaurant (?) on the second floor of Oriental Centre (perhaps 100 metres away from this \"fine\" establishment), where we received excellent service and good food."}
{"text":"Perfect food. Perfect service. Perfect Chinese Restaurant.  When I came in to the restaurant, the service was wonderful, they gave me a paper and a pencil. The server was like \"I don't give a shit.\" Love the attitude. I waiting 15 mins for them to get the kitchen ready so she would take my order. 10/10 service  The food was refrigerated, the taste is bland. Typical Toronto Chinese restaurant food. 10/10  The name of the restaurant was perfect 10/10"}
{"text":"My Japanese friend was invited here by a Chinese colleague.  My friend arrived early and was given the English menu.  When his colleague arrived, he was given the Chinese menu.  Being Japanese, my friend was able to read enough of  his colleague's Chinese menu to notice many differences in prices for identical items.  Total rip-off for non-Chinese patrons. As my friend commented later, Perfect for Chinese Customers Restaurant.  Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Despite the 3 stars, I actually like this place because it feels a little dangerous. The food comes out ridiculously fast but sometimes there isn't enough room on the table and the staff just shout at each other."}
{"text":"I come here all the time! But today I came and as always the service wasn't the greatest but the worst part was the food. Our spare ribs were not cooked! I wouldn't come here. My advice is to just get McDonald's"}
{"text":"Food: - average Chinese dim sum   Service: - terrible service as no one acknowledged us ever again after giving us tea"}
{"text":"I've been to this place many many times but I will never go again. I got food poisoning. I had it for dinner on Saturday night and had horrible food poisoning all Sunday. Awful. It is sad because I'm fairly certain this was the first place I ever had dim sum."}
{"text":"My review of the Perfect Chinese Restaurant could never be as refreshingly Funny and perfect as Mark.S's was! LOL!  Also, my review could never be nearly as lovely as Chrissy's obviously is!  Both of their reviews say very eloquently most of what you really need to know about Perfect... It's open 24/7. It's a great place to get good, cheap, authentic Chinese Food. The service here is almost comical! The waiters do not really communicate at all. Forget friendly service because thats not what people come here for. The come for the Dim Sum! This joint has got that real \"Middle-Of-Nowhere\" vibe to it too. It's located in a non-descript little dump of a Plaza, right near Sheppard Ave East and Brimley in Scarborough. I'm almost disappointed that I've never seen any of the \"Late Night Craziness\" that Perfect is known for! This restaurant has always been relatively \"normal\" when I've been there at 2 or 3 in the morning! Endorsed completely by my Chinese and Filipino buddies, it's the Perfect place to go to get good Chinese Food in the middle of the bloody night, when nothing else around it is open!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food. We ordered a number of dim sum dishes from their late night menu. Service is mediocre too. They open late so their convenient for a late night bite after sports, clubbing, etc. I would recommend for only this reason. Intended audience is non-Chinese, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Despite the name, this place is the antithesis of perfect. Crowded, loud, dirty, hurried, horrible service, bland food.  I won't go into too much detail but here are the highlights:  The waitress glowered at us when we asked for napkins and then didn't bring them and disappeared for the rest of the meal.  The chair seat cushions were an indescribable color due to years of grease being spilled by diners.  There was a half eaten shrimp under the table. We did not order shrimp and gawd knows how long it had been there.  The table next to us got a sizzling platter and it sizzled so much that my friend went into a coughing fit. You see, despite serving and pushing their sizzling platters, there is a definite lack of ventilation. The large vents on the ceiling in fact do not seem to function.   I left feeling robbed of my precious youth and optimistic outlook on life!"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time with my parents. This restaurant is known for its 24 hour dim sum service. Their price point is slightly lower than other dim sum restaurants. You almost always have to wait in line for a table, so come early !   The decor is very average. But their food is decent. Portion size is average. All in all its a good choice if you want some cheap dim sum !"}
{"text":"For dim sum, this is the best deal in town. Weekdays 7am-4pm priced at $2.10 (S&M) $2.30 (L), $2.50 (XL) and $3.00 (SP).  Tea is $0.60 per person.  One of few remaining places where you order dim sum exclusively from trolley carts,  For some reason, some of the patrons cannot wait for the carts to come around. Clutching their order forms, they prowl the room, hunting down the cart ladies and triumphantly return to their tables with their dim sum finds.  While taste is average, this restaurant still merits a nod because of its low prices, good portion sizes, and dishes are still hot when it reaches the table.. Tip: They will often try to sit you inside the banquet room.  Why? Because you pay an additional $0.20 per dim sum inside that room.  You are paying for real table cloth vs plastic sheet in the main room."}
{"text":"This place has been around longer than Scarborough!  I've only ever had the dim sum here and honestly you might not find a better bang for your buck in terms of quality and price.  The food is decent for sure and the prices are some of the cheapest in town.   I absolutely hate the service here.  I find it slow and the staff pretty rude.  The last time I was here I was run over twice by hostesses flying by without looking in the direction they were going to be shot dirty looks of why are you in my way as well as being hit by the cart people.  They take forever in recognizing you have flagged them down for either extra tea or the bills.  However it's a pretty cheap decent option for dim sum so you have to take the bad with the good if you are on a budget."}
{"text":"Dim sum in the traditional style, giant mob at the door, table numbers being called out and push carts. Can eat very inexpensively.   Came a few times, lunch doesn't cost more than $12-$20 for two people. It was $40 for a group of 5 people once and we seriously ordered our heart out. The lunch noodle specials for $5 bucks are pretty good too, chicken chow mien is white meat.   Recommend for great value. Depending on what time you arrive, be prepared to wait. Service is hit and miss.   Lunch is better than dinner. But at 3:00 in the morning, who complains, it's open."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner on a saturday afternoon and they were still serving cheap dim sum.  Place was filthy, napkins and food all over the floor.  Service was cold, like the waiters all didn't want to work there.  We ordered 4 dishes which were completely forgettable.  Food was completely boring, no wok hay at all.  If you want to have cheaper food at odd times then sure come here.  But if you want quality, best to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for Dim Sum.  Asked for chrysanthemum tea...    food was cheap and tastes cheap.  At the end, just before we left, i poured myself last cup of tea and noticed bunch of bugs came out...YUCK!  That means the whole pot of tea that we drank had bugs steeping in there.  (pictures attached).  Complained about the tea to the server, but when the bill came, they still billed us $2.80 for the tea....WTF!!!  I don't mind paying for the food, but I refused to pay $2.80 for the tea...DISGUSTING!  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/I6oxEn1HT41S2GPrDKPPvA?select=f_htg2D0T-oiohdOMqPCZg"}
{"text":"Amazing food, available literally at all hours of the day. This is my go to place for dim sum and fish maw soup with crab meat! Love this place and the service is very respectable and quite quick even at 3:00am haha! Totally recommend this place, plus there's free parking ;)"}
{"text":"I had a huge craving for dimsum in the afternoon and I remember this place so I thought I'd call to see if they were serving dimsum. When I called, they said yes, dimsum 24/7. So I came with my boyfriend.  After waiting for 30 mins, we got seated and didn't get a dimsum menu so I asked and they said they don't so dimsum before 9pm!!! I was so pissed.  THEN, after we decided on some other stuff, I saw the table beside us get dimsum so I asked another person, and they said they do have dimsum all day, just steamed. Can they not get their stuff straight? By this point, I already ordered some more expensive overpriced common food so I didn't want to spend anymore money. But boy am I pissed.  We got some dishes and got the Peking duck promo. The veggie dish was alright, very oily but tastes good. The roasted pork we got was meh.... Too much lean meat to skin, flavor was okay.  The duck was super disappointing.  The wrap was 3-4 times as thick as it should be. It was still coated in raw flour and all stuck together. The duck itself was nothing special. The sauce is kinda weird.... Different from the usual and they don't offer cucumber sticks. Only carrot and onion, which I thought was very very very weird. I've never had a place not give cucumber, and I even asked for it.  They give you free soup and dessert, like any other place.  I had such a bad and frustrating experience. Never coming back again and never recommending. Service is so bad and people can't get their rules straight."}
{"text":"The food was actually pretty good, did not get dim sum there since it was pretty overpriced at around $2.60 a dish. Had two plates of rice which was average but definitely above my expectations while reading the other reviews. Gave them a solid 4 stars even though their food was nothing spectacular but being opened at 4am and providing food fod 3 hungry guys definitely puts it up there. Jnlike what other people said, the service was actually pretty good. Food came fast, had our tea filled, cold water when asked and no rude atitude at all!"}
{"text":"Good comfort food at very affordable price. Dimsum are 1.80$ each after 2pm. Seafood 5 course with lobster, clams, shrimp and fish for 45$. Can\"t beat that. The place is always full so expect to wait."}
{"text":"My go-to Chinese resto in Scarborough! Open 24/7. Reliable. Clean. Always good food. I mean there's better Chinese restos but really and truly Perfect isn't about being fancy and excellent. They're dependable, cheap, and always hits the spot! I'll take that over fancy and overpriced anytime!"}
{"text":"This place used to be great and I come here often, but I came Jan 7th 2018 and the food and SERVICE is the worst. It's odd because it's all the same staff so you'd expect it to be the same.  But when you take a number, they call the bigger tables first - a group of 4 people who came in less than 5 minutes got their table before the rest of us, and there must have been 10 of us waiting for a table for 2 for as long as 30-35 minutes.  This kept happening with 8 other bigger groups!  For your information, if you're seated in the second room (the smaller room behind the front desk), dim sum cost more and the food doesn't come as frequently as they are eaten quickly from the first room.  Some of the carts will start in the second room but it's not as much.  Also, after you've paid, if you're expecting change, let them know or you'll be waiting forever for money that will never come.  I couldn't sit at my table because the previous customers didn't get their change, it was awkward because our table was already changed, new plates were already set, and the tea pot was already poured. But we just stood there awkwardly waiting for them to get up.  It took some time for the waitress to find their bill and get their appropriate change.   As for food, I felt particles of sand while I was chewing but didn't mention it, just spat it out. Then my friend mentioned the shrimp might be sandy. We later figured out it was most likely the hot sauce because there were small pieces of sand-like texture in both the sui mai, tripe and har gow dishes.  I know this place isn't the cleanest but this is a real turn off.  Too bad I won't be coming back, I did really like this place.  But there are too many negatives especially the filt and poor service.  Nobody got time for that!"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food restaurant I've ever tried. Food quality was horrible and the servers attitudes were atrocious,  no smiles and getting them to bring you something was like asking them to walk on hot coals. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Given I came at 2AM after arriving in Scarborough after driving 8 hours from NY, this place is probably better in the morning or at regular normal pedestrian hours. I came here and the service was somewhat slow. The food and dim sum didn't seem fresh. It tasted like it was heated back up after a long day of sitting around. Also, please be aware. When I went at night, it is definitely not a family friendly environment. It was very loud and at one point, it seemed like things were about to get hostile. My family and I wanted to finish our meal and leave the establishment. Definitely give this place a try but at normal hours. It may be 24 hours but your better off ordering take out next time if your looking to dine in the midnight hours."}
{"text":"Dumplings fix for my midnight cravings! Bought 4 dumplings for 2 and a change, their fried squid tentacles is not fishy and actually taste good, hot sour soup is decent and serving is pretty good"}
{"text":"It's not great but it's here so they good with me. The jasmine tea is good and like cleanses your pallet for the mediocre food and the staff don't talk to you so if you an introvert you'll love it. Gotta like flag someone down for water though lol"}
{"text":"This is a 24h Chinese restaurant. A good place to eat at if you just want to fill your stomach at odd hours (like late at night) but the quality and taste of the food is not the greatest. Servers are also not the nicest. Would probably not come here again."}
{"text":"Decent & Cheap prices. Their lunch time DIMSUM hits the spot everytime. Its priced much lower then any Richmond Hill competitor although not as good its a great cheap option. Just be prepared to wait in line during Dim Sum hours. Huge crowds on weekends.   Open 24 hours. Local Police frequent this place at night for late night cravings."}
{"text":"My parents got married here and we've been coming here for years. But I do not think we will be returning again. Why, you may ask? The dim sum is cheap here, which is great. Dinner here is also great. The fact that it's open 24/7 is great. But what ISN'T great is the service. The waiters here are so rude, it's ridiculous. You need your pot of tea refilled? Don't expect it to be. You need some napkins? Might as well get it yourself.  Not only that, but the restaurant is extremely loud - you can't even hear yourself think. What COMPLETELY drew the line was when my Mom asked the waitress (the one with the twitchy eye) in Chinese what one of the dishes that she saw being brought out was because she wanted to order it and the stupid waitress told her she didn't have time to talk to her. That made me so angry, how could you possibly say that to one of your customers? It is YOUR JOB to tend to your customers needs.  Everyone working here looks miserable and like they hate their jobs or something. Such a shame that such good food is being so horribly served. Never coming here ever again after what happened."}
{"text":"I am not sure what happened, but the food here  used to be awesome!  I love lemon chicken and sweet and sour pork and now I get meat full for gristle and hard pieces!  I enjoyed the free meal with purchase coupon however NOW the food is disappointing.  With so many Chinese restaurants in Scarborough why go back?  I am sad!"}
{"text":"Best spot for quick food after you hit the clubs on the weekend. It's always busy late nights, if you arrive at a bad time you will be waiting for a table. Dunno how they do it but the food arrives fast every time. The deep fried quail is awesome. A must try!"}
{"text":"I think...they need to change the name. When we visit family, we always go here atleast once and everytime Im hoping theyve improved since the last year we were there and it doesnt. Service...laughable. Food, alright. Price, can't beat it.   Line for dim sum even on a week day can be quite long.  Not much more I can say."}
{"text":"Open 24 hrs is the best place to get good food after a long night out,  The quail & fried crab are bomb  Traditional dim sum menu is legit as well   Always respectful service even though some waiters don't seem to understand English they are all professional and try to provide good service  Been going here for 10+ years and never had a problem, keep it up"}
{"text":"The Perfect Chinese Restaurant is, of course, far from perfect, as many others have said. However, in the final evaluation, it delivers a reasonable value for a very low price, and is one of the last places in Toronto with the push cart service, during peak dim sum hours.  From the hostess / owner with the shrill, brain-piercing voice, to the cheap \"kitchen-catcher\" plastic glad-bag tablecloths, perfect Chinese is loud and boisterous and entirely focused on value instead of high quality. That said, once your expectations are correctly moderated, at just $2 per dim-sum selection, they do a good job of delivering what we like to call \"cheap and cheerful\" face-stuffing, except there is no cheerfulness, LOL.  Basically, they do a 3-star job of delivering 1 star, down & dirty, dim sum dining. Don't travel out of your way to get here, but if you're in the neighborhood and hungry for some dim sum, know that 24 hours a day perfect Chinese will fill you up for just a few dollars."}
{"text":"The most amazing thing about this place is that they serve dim sum at 3am. The crowd at that time is nothing like what you see during the day, lets just say I was a bit scared to walk in and a fight almost broke out between the 2 tables next to us. But when you have a craving that needs to be satisfied after a long night of work or partying this place will hit the spot. Its a different experience."}
{"text":"Not the best (congee queen/Wong are prob better) but the decent food, prices, service, and opening 24 makes it my go to place for takeout and late night eats.  I often get the squid tentacles. Sometimes it's a bit too well done and makes it a bit too chewy, but still decent.  The Satay Beef Stomach had no satay flavor, and it was chewy. Wasn't very good. The curry baby octopus had good curry taste and the octopus had good texture. The Ha Gao was also very good.  Quality: 6/10. Service: 7/10. Value: 7/10. Overall: 6.5/10 (Not an Average)"}
{"text":"The actual food is not bad and the food is definitely a good price. Amazing prices in fact, especially for the peking duck special. But the customer service is horrible and I worry about the hygiene of the place and of its workers. Very disengaged and rude workers who don't care about the customer experience and aren't afraid to show it on their face and say it to you. It's obviously they don't like their jobs. I haven't seen a single server there actually smile at a customer. Hygiene is also an issue. The way the tables are cleaned, some of the dishes and plates that are served don't always look like they've been cleaned properly, which worries me about how they prepare the food. Hopefully the kitchen staff are better than the wait staff."}
{"text":"I stand by my previous review. I really do like this place. Due to the volume of people moving through this place during lunch hours, I find that the dim sum in general during that time is piping hot and fresh.  This review is for their dinner hour, where our party of five had a special set menu that was about $54 before tax. Everything was good from the fish with veg to the delicious saucy pork chops to the Chinese-style crab, etc.  It was the service that really stood out for me though from one of the head waitresses. She poured our tea whenever she walked by. She made sure we had everything we needed and when my brother left something behund, she actually chased our car down to make sure we got it back! Thanks and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for the food and was told one of the dishes ordered wasn't coming anymore as they ran out.  The portion size is a lot smaller than typical chinese restaurant..."}
{"text":"Dozens of Asian octogenarians packing the place on a random Tuesday aren't wrong: this place is so cheaply priced for decent eats that there is really no complaining. $30 for two people stuffed, with one meal's worth of takeout, was our lot.   24/7 eats! What I encountered: not the freshest dumplings, but killer deep fried chicken wings, yummy greens, hot savoury congee & flaky pastries. Fast, no nonsense service.   You will probably share a table!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night with 7 others and we quickly got a table.  It wasn't really busy.    They had a Peking duck special where if you order $20 worth of entrees/dishes, you can get a Peking duck for $11.99.  Since there were 8 of us and we all wanted Peking duck, we ordered a second duck.  Unfortunately, the special was only valid for the first duck.  Regular price duck is $31.99, but that came with lettuce wrap as a second course with the duck.  Sucks were fatty and flavourful, but the wrap was extremely thick and sticky.  No good at all!  The rest of the entrees were average.  Service was good, all servers were attentive and quick!  To end, average food, good service!"}
{"text":"RUDE! Rude! rude!!!  If I could give this dive a minus 5 stars I would. Dont expect any service. It doesnt exist. Self service all the way. Want tea? Get up and go to the waitress station and pour it yourself. They dont care. In fact it saves them work. Need an extra chopstick, spoon, takeout box, plastic bag, etc., etc. -- Get it yourself. People here, wait staff here... even the managers are rude af. This is the epitomy of low class, low service, and mediocre dim sum. If you want a place where you get treated like a homeless person you've found it. Never give them a tip. They dont deserve it. Majority of dim sum is soggy and watery. Not cooked properly. The steamed ceramic rice bowls are cooked with too much water. Comes out soggy at the bottom like you're eating congee or porridge. Yeeesh!! A couple of waitresses actually do their job. However, the tall lady with the short bowl cut and the squinty eyes shorter waitress with glasses need a smack upside the head. I speak english, cantonese, and mandarin. Even when speaking cantonese they are very low class, rude, crass, and terse. Their broken crappy english is better mannered. Bottom line if you want \"cheap\" you get \"CHEAP\". In all aspects from food to service. Again, never tip these folks. Dont deserve it one iota. Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"People aren't joking, service here is pretty awful. We got attitude when asked to be seated, had to ask for water 3 times (from 2 different waiters!) before we got it and had our entrées a full 10 minutes before we got our steamed rice (again after asking twice).   The food is mostly fine. I found my Sweet and Sour Chicken to be way, way too stringy and chewy. Kept picturing chicken feet for some reason. It's not great and nothing special. Price wise it's average and decor is average.   Probably one of few places I wouldn't bother coming back to."}
{"text":"Everything was soso. Nothing too fancy or dazzling. Customer service needs to be improved."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for  while because it offers something unique in this area - 24 hour dim sum. This is one of my value selections in that it offers excellent food for the price you pay. Yes, there is better dim sum out there, but this is pretty good and you don't have to wait an hour just to get in the front door. You order the dim sum from a menu as they do not have the rolling carts you find at true dim sum restaurants. I like the har gow, the bean curd roll, the squid tentacles, the vegetable dumpling, the sticky rice, the sui mai, and the deep fried quail. You can also order from the expansive menu, items such as the green beans with minced pork, the phoenix seafood nest, and my old stand by, the rice noodles with beef. I will be back again because every time I go here I fill up quickly on some pretty tasty food that doesn't break the bank."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 15 years but this is my first review for what I say is the best East-end GTA dim sum place.  It's always a zoo here with locals elbowing each other to get the attention of \"The Warden\" at the main entrance for \"your number on the wait list.\"  Bring cash!  I was seated 5 minutes upon arrival because I was alone and willing to share a table with other patrons; not a preference for most diners.  There are two dining areas serving the exact same food; the left side has real table cloths and is more expensive OR the right side which has tables covered with disposable plastic table cloths.  I chose Right for savings!  Carts of food whisk by quickly so be aware & prepared to pounce; some people actual take their bill and chase down a cart so they're not disappointed.  Prices range from $2.30 and up.  Enjoy bottomless tea for a fixed price while dining."}
{"text":"This place is a old-time favorite amongst Asian families. My family has been going here for decades and they are always quick on the dishes and lots of selection. Love the perks of the free soup and dessert they give you. Best to go for a dimsum and a quick bite to eat. Portions are plentiful and affordable."}
{"text":"I have not been to Perfect for years but I was there last weekend after a rare late night out with my cousin and we were hungry but did not want McDonalds. And somehow I automatically thought of Perfect as I know it's a 24/7 restaurant. I have probably only been there twice, but it's not like anything went down whenever I was there- I guess you have to be a regular to witness stuff happening! I did take note that it was very multicultural and yes there is a wide range of people from different walks of life. I loved it! It felt different than the usual dim sum places I frequented. Food was surprisingly good, service was good too, no complaints. Yep, I am definitely going to come back to try the Peking duck!"}
{"text":"Always decent food at a decent price. Very large restaurant. Good service.  Been there many times in the past."}
{"text":"Food:   Came here with my friends over the Christmas break, and ordered about 18 plates of dim sum.  This place was really cheap ($2.00 for a plate on weekdays).  When the food came, we were surprised.  The food was either cold, or raw.  We ordered a stuffed tofu, and I tasted raw flour in it!  We also ordered a chicken steamed bun and found that the meat inside was still raw.  Needless to say, we all felt sick after that experience.  Service:  Horrendous; we arrived at 3pm, and they were handing out the menu that you order your dim sum from.  They basically had 1 lady come around to 20-30 tables to give each table their dim sum ordering sheets.  It took about 10-15 minutes before we got ours.  The other waitresses were just standing around doing nothing.  My friend also got cussed off by a waitress for telling her that we don't need our teapot refilled."}
{"text":"Lots of food- very late. If you know - you know"}
{"text":"Perfect is perfect for late night eats and early morning treats! They have  everything here from dim sum, chinese food, seafood, and a variety of other yummy dishes!  The service was pretty good for 3am and they were very accomodating to our party of 10. We ordered chicken balls, fried rice, veggies, salt and pepper squid, dim sum dishes, and hot and sour soup.  All of the dishes came out quick and they were super fresh!   Their hot and sour soup was amazing! I could not stop eating it!  Their dim sum dishes were fresh and it felt like a great finish to an awesome evening! It was my first time coming to Perfect and I can definitely tell you that I WILL Be back! (Arnold Voice).  The price was cheap and parking a plenty! Come here to end on a Perfect note!"}
{"text":"Go here if u r drunk and hungry after midnight and need to fill the belly...I guess you have no other choice if you are in the east end...  other choice is going downtown.  Do not order the dumpling  with soup. ..it's dry. They have no idea on keeping it with the soup. I was foolish to expect quality food from here.  Price was too much.   If the owner of Congee Queen reads this...I suggest you try keeping the Kennedy Sheppard location open 24 hours from Friday until 5 am Monday.    I would travel 45 minutes go to there instead of this dump.  I guess when your choices are limited and your drunk enough and taste doesn't matter....this is the Perfect Place to eat."}
{"text":"The Perfect Chinese should change its name to the Defect Chinese Restaurant... Oh wait... I don't think that will do much to up its slumping reputation.  This restaurant has been around for a long time.  It was at the height of its popularity at the time right before they took over the store space next to them and expanded and redecorated...   The only thing that is preventing me from giving it a 1 star is that the food is actually not bad.  The service however... Ouf!  If I could give 0 stars I would for their service.  The last time we were there, it was 10AM, and after about 30 minutes of not seeing the beloved Shrimp Dumplings Cart our 2 tables of 16 people total decided to get the bill and venture to another Dim Sum venue.  The service was non-existent, and so we didn't leave much of a tip considering that they really were just open for the sake of being open.    When we went to pay the bill at the counter, they had the nerve to ask us for tips.  To which we said - for what service?  Hey, if you have the balls to ask for tips when you provide no service, we will have the balls to tell you why you aren't getting any!  There may be one exception that would bring me back to this place.  And it would go a little like this...  Me - I'm kind of craving some seafood baked rice.  Don't really want to drive all the way up to the PMall area to find a HK-style diner... *light bulb goes on* Wait, they serve it at the Perfect Chinese at Dim Sum Prices...  *arrives at Perfect Chinese* Sits down... orders nothing and waits until the Seafood Baked Rice comes.  Devour it.  Ask for the bill, drop $4.  Leave.    IMHO, the only reason why this place is still open is because:  1) Its cheap 2) Its open 24 hours, therefore, it caters to the Casino Rama crowd who come back in the wee hours of the morning  Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"3.5  This is the cheapest place for dim sum in the Scarborough/Markham area. Come early or be prepared to wait! Food here is good but their chicken feet taste a little off.. But whatever as long as they have my egg tarts I'm good! This restaurant is also opened 24/7, good for late night eats."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night dinner with a bunch of people after a social gathering and was pretty impressed with the quality of food and service at 12am. We ordered a bunch of dishes including dim sum and everything was fresh and tasty and even the presentation was appealing. It was perfect for the most part except that some of the utensils were dirty but usually the grundgiest asian restaurants serve better tasting food.  The restaurant was packed serving all different ethnic groups and managed to still provide efficient and attentive service.  I'll definitely come back here if im ever in the area for their dim sum lunch."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours.  The foods OK. Nothing overly exciting but still quite tasty. Their menu offers a nice variety of dishes and dim sum is also available. I wouldn't say this is the best dim sum out there but not bad for a restaurant open 24 hours.   What makes this restaurant NOT so PERFECT is their service. It's incredibly slow and inattentive. You will most likely have to wait for someone to notice you. As I looked around, the tables beside us were also looking for an employee. If you need refills on tea (don't even bother asking for water), extra napkins, sauce or anything, you may be waiting for a LONG time. What did come out quick was our bill!  Plenty of seating is available. The restaurant isn't all that organized. Though the service was bad, their food was still good.   I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. It's a nice option to have on hand when you feel like eating something and all the other restaurants are closed."}
{"text":"Below was my original review. Today I had to revise it to as few stars as possible. In fact if negative stars can be awarded, this would be one of those locations.   The turning point was the disgustingly filthy glass that came with my order of a soft drink. Not only were we treated as we were idiots to complain about the glass but they were reluctant to exchange for us. Given this, I cannot over look the poor hygiene of its employees and cannot help think how filthy the kitchen could be. Perhaps they are able to appease the health department, but I cannot overcome my fear of dining at such an establishment.   ****  Definitely not bad. For $30, the winter melon soup is just ok. It's not counted towards a discounted dish, and the lack of shrimps, crabs, etc. It's just ok. Not fancy or perfect by any stretch of the imagination.   It's a decently priced establishment for a simple evening dinner."}
{"text":"It's good. (not the best for Dim Sum, but pretty good)  It's cheap.  Not friendly, but open 24/7!"}
{"text":"The coconut milk mango pudding...the best! Shrimps rolls and dim sum is good. Nothing too special aside from the hours!"}
{"text":"There are not many choices of dim sum.  Takes a while for food cart turnover which means you have to wait longer for food of your choice. The 2 stars was because this place is cheap."}
{"text":"Just went to perfect chinese restaurant was recommended and me and my family WERE NOT DISAPPOINED the food was really great.  The 2 dishes 1)seafood shrimp and clams was great also the i personally loved the noodles so tasty 2) the grouper is  my personal favorite love that seafood.  The grouper was made really well.  I WILL BE ATTENDING AGIAN WENT I GO FOR Chinese. Only one thing is i wish their take out container where better they did leak in my car."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Dim Sum. It's not the best dim sum in town, and certainly not gourmet, but it has a huge selection of carts wandering the aisles, food is fresh and good and the prices are dirt cheap. The restaurant is open 24hrs/day, but I have only gone for dim sum lunches on a weekly basis.  Why do I give it 4-Stars? Because it excels at what it tries to be...cheap, fast, \"greasy spoon\" type, tasty Chinese food."}
{"text":"The first time I've ever been to Perfect was right after a night out clubbing downtown, about 10 years ago, I never even heard of this place before that night and I thought this must have been a popular place. But: 1. I was inebriated and 2. It was 3:30am.  I recently returned here after helping my friend move to her new place that was nearby to Perfect, and it wasn't as busy as I remembered it had been and it was around 9pm. We were seated immediately with dinner menus, but we wanted dim sum. They were a bit hesitant on giving us those, not really sure why.  The restaurant was not extremely busy, there was a few tables empty and it didn't look like they were understaffed because I saw quite a number of staff around when we were trying to get more tea (or even, the bill), but it didn't seem like any of them want to pay attention or stop at our table.   Food was acceptable and by no means great, especially if you have been to some pretty amazing dim sum restaurants elsewhere in Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area, but no other restaurant really serves dim sum after 4pm.  Perhaps it'll be the most perfect thing if you come here when you're intoxicated and need your Chinese food fix at 4am.  If practice makes perfect, this restaurant should really be called Practice because it is not perfect at all."}
{"text":"Came here while craving some dim sum. Seems to be the spot, as it was pretty busy when entering and leaving the restaurant.   They seated us in the corner of the restaurant and seemed to have forgotten us when coming around in carts. My cousin had to actually go up to them to place orders, or else it would have probably taken an extra hour to get some orders in.  The food when arrived was actually pretty decent. Not the best, but not bad either.  Wish the service was better.. workers seemed a little rude. At least the waters and tea were being refilled accordingly!"}
{"text":"Ive been coming here since I was little since my godfather is one of the top chefs in the kitchen for lunch time. I always tend to go on the weekend and when I go for \" Dimsum time\" which is mainly around 10-1 ? It's always packed! I love that I get VIP since we only have to wait 5-10 mins tops. Were always seated at a large table and table fee is always free. We always get good service since everyone knows my god father and wouldn't dare cross us since I am with his wife. I personally love the seafood rice ( of course is made by my godfather).  This is by far the only place I go for Dimsum!"}
{"text":"The title of this restaurant says it all..... well for availability..... its open 24 hours I think or at least late enough to hit after a night of partying."}
{"text":"Perfect Chinese is in a plaza near a bunch of other Chinese restaurants on Sheppard. When first going in, you're greeted with a lot of fish tanks full of fish and lobster and crab. The décor is nice and the place looked clean. I went with my SO and we were not greeted when first coming in. We had to ask to be seated after waiting awkwardly near the cash registers for a while. When seated, we received plates and cups and a pot of jasmine tea. The waiter didn't say anything and he kind of dropped the dinnerware and disappeared really quickly. We received one menu between the two of us, which isn't that big a deal, but it was awkward.  There were several people dining, since most of the dishes are family style, it makes sense to come here in large groups. Ordering is done by writing down which item you'd like on a paper provided. The wait for the food was quite lengthy though. After ordering we may have waited just over half an hour before our main dishes came out. Another thing is most of the main dishes do not come with rice. I ordered a duck dish and my SO ordered chicken with black bean sauce and onions. The food here is very mediocre for the price of it. A little too much grease for my taste and the absence of rice is disappointing. I've received a lot more generous portions from other restaurants.  It's meh. The upside is that they're open 24/7, so if you're back in the area after clubbing or drinking , you can get some late night Chinese food."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Never disappoints! They are open 24 hours and dim sum served all day and all night. The prices are so good which makes you want to order more. The service is quick even when it's really busy. I even brought my stroller and it fit in the dinning room. The portions are a good size for sharing and everything just tastes so good. So glad this is close by and knowing that's it's 24 hours we always come by."}
{"text":"Friends took us here for dim sum. (I hope they don't read this and find out how much i didn't like it). On the plus side. It was Cheap.  40.00 for four of us. But that does not forgive the lack of cleanliness. Fried food was greasy and the seafood in the tanks that they were serving had many dead one floating in them making me leary of eating any seafood.  And if they found it acceptable to show us all dying creatures, what sins were hidden in the kitchen?"}
{"text":"The service is TERRIBLE!!!! It is absolutely impossible to get the attention of the waiter, it seems as if they ignore you and don't want to help you. The food is average and definitely not worth dealing with the long waits for basic things such as a refill on water, or the bill."}
{"text":"Hot stuff! I've always wondered why I hadn't been here in forever. Apparently, Grandpa isn't so fond of this place for dim sum 1) because it's cheap, and 2) because it's old. He likes fancier settings, and I basically only go to dim sum with him. Or well, 95% of the time.  We actually came this time because of Grandpa. He saw their 34th anniversary specials in the newspaper and though he could order them all. He couldn't. Limit to 1 per table. The specials have ended now, but they were $6.99 for Vancouver crab stir-fried with ginger and green onion, $6.99 for some kind of lamb hot pot pot (but on a plate?), $3.99 for a free range chicken (I'm guessing half, but I could be wrong), and $10.99 for Peking duck. Somehow, we ended up with both the crab and the duck at discount price. We also ordered snow pea shoots with garlic ($13.99?), grouper with tofu in hot pot ($12.50), pork chops stir-fried with preserved olives (I didn't order this one so I don't know the price), and a quail ($3.99). The quail never came. They forgot to put it on our order.   Most things were decent. Nothing was particularly cheap, other than the specials. I guess they save those discounts for dim sum. The grouper looked like a good deal, but the portion was smaller than usual, so I suppose it balanced out some. I do appreciate that it was mostly grouper and tofu though, and not much filler veg. The pork chops were really fatty, but tasty. The crab was good, but like all crab, it was difficult to eat. I would have appreciated a shell cracker or to have the shell more cracked for my. I'm not the biggest fan of chewing through shell with my teeth. The Peking duck was good for price, but boy were those wrappers thick. I also got a bit of bone in one of the pieces of skin that they put out for us. I'm not sure how that happened, other than that there was so much meat attached to the skin that they nicked the bone. Still, a whole duck for $10.99 (the carcass was chopped up and given back to us as a second course as well) is a fantastic deal.  I want to come back for dim sum. Ideally on a weekday. They have a weekday fried noodle lunch special for $2.99 that changes depending on which weekday you go. They also have a spare rib and rice noodle roll hot pot for $4.99, also at lunch. Those sound like fantastic cheap eats to me. It's odd to me that a place that has live Alaskan king crabs also does super cheap lunch specials..."}
{"text":"Super poor service, waited hours not much of food selection cart come around. Plate and cups are dirty."}
{"text":"LOL perfect should be renamed to \"sketchy post-clubbing dimsum place that only sounds good after 12am\" That is how I recall this 24/7 restaurant. It's really rare to see 24/7 dim sum restaurants, so when I was asked to come here after a concert downtown, I was so down. Helllloooooo, I'm asian. Dim sum runs in my blood.. so am I down for it anytime? Yes. Yes I am.  The area is sketchy and I fear of getting robbed as I'm chowing down on asian food, especially since this place usually only accepts cash (their machines are down like, 99% of the time) ..the servers are rushed and rude. I mean, it wouldn't kill them to be nice to the people that tip them..? Can't even get any service without being ignored for an hour first. Maybe it's because I was there at 2am, maybe it's because I was expecting too much for an asian restaurant. But seriously.. what the hell?   The food is passable but doesn't meet my dim sum standards. Siu mai was soggy and too salty while the fried squid was tasteless and had too much batter. I got also this beef brisket noodle, which was meh. Honestly, for a midnight meal, I can't complain.   I can assure you I won't be here unless I'm in that post-club/bar/concert 2am dim sum and chill mood."}
{"text":"Quite the popular restaurant staple in Scarborough. If you live in Scarborough, you know about this place for sure. It's open 24 hours and has decent cheap dim sum. They also have decent cheap late night food which is a popular place coupled with cheap beers and alcohol. Food here is generally pretty cheap and good. Service is a far from perfect here. The service here always seem vary from each visit but generally it's pretty bad. If I have to go up to get tea, water and a takeout box then I shouldn't be obligated to give tip here. Many folks come here during the weekday and especially weekend mornings for cheap dim sum as it's quite popular. For dinner, they have the peking duck special which we came here for. If you spend $25 or more for dinner, the peking duck is only $10.99 which is a good deal. We ordered a variety of dishes including the Peking duck, a veggie dish, clams in blackbean sauce, sizzling plate of pork chop with and Fujian fried rice. Peking duck is spot on with the flavours and I loved the stir-fried meat they do with the meat mixed with veggies where you eat it with a lettuce wrap- simply delectable! The clams were delicious and of course the sizzling plate with pork chop with a sweet and sour sauce was really good. I didn't like the Fujian fried rice as it tasted under seasoned so this definitely fell short for me. They only accept cash and credit but not debit which is strange. There minimum requirement to use credit card is a $32 purchase which is kind of strange. Overall, a decent place for dim sum and dinner. Always love to keep coming here despite the horrendous service at times. It's the food that really keeps me coming back here."}
{"text":"This Scarborough Chinese Restaurant has been a long time local favourite and has been around since at least the 80's. It's gone through some expansion and a refresh over the years with the restaurant having 3 distinct areas. The oldest main area which is on the right side when you enter. The newer back area, on your left. They also have a completely separate private banquet room across the hall for parties, birthdays, private functions, etc...  They are open 24 hours and you will see a diverse crowd at all times of day. The late night crowd can be a little seedy at times.  The food here is good. Not the best I've had but you won't be disappointed with the vast majority of menu offerings. The flavours and dishes are authentic and taste proper. They even have dimsum available 24hrs. Pushcarts during breakfast/brunch and made to order for dinner.  I've ordered many dishes here: salted fish and chicken fried rice, Cantonese chow menu, sweet and sour pork, lobster with green onion, spicy squid, chinese broccoli with beef, rice noodles with beef, all types of dimsum, fried chicken. Everything is consistent.  This place gets 3 stars because the food is good. The decor is typical of this type of full serve Chinese restaurant and clean. Service is just OK."}
{"text":"This is the go to spot for my family for dim sum. The prices are reasonable and the food is great. I've been coming here since I was in diapers so my dad knows some of the staff really well (he's a regular customer). Since the staff have a good relationship with my dad, I don't find the service too bad as they're all super friendly. The dim sum items can get a little greasy but nonetheless they are delicious. We occasionally come here for dinner as they have a lobster or duck special.  For around $100 you get soup, duck wraps, veggies, fish, lobster, chicken, and a red bean soup dessert. The only downside about this place is that it gets very crowded during peak times (weekend mornings) that people end up waiting around the seating area which is really awkward. Tip: if you want to save a tad bit of money, eating in the main dining area with the plastic covered tables is cheaper than eating in the other dining area with the nicer looking tablecloths"}
{"text":"food is average and salty.  service is subpar.  website provides inaccurate information.  restaurant is not the cleanest but there is adequate parking."}
{"text":"While they do serve 24/7 dim sum, I'm extremely disappointed to how they treated me. It's Chinese New Year, I walk in and right away the hostess directs my mom and I into a room. There were many table in the main hall available but she decided that the room was more suitable for us. Mind you, the tables inside the room are a bit fancier, covered with linen table cloths rather than the old school plastic sheets. As soon as I find my seat, I asked her how much more does it cost to sit in this area. She promptly replied \"extra 20 cents\". Alright, since I was not made aware of this charge I swiftly walked out and chose a table by the main hall. I know my Cantonese is a bit lacking, but I could clearly hear her say in Cantonese \"these people are getting up, they no longer want to sit here\". This is not the first time I've witnessed rude personnel in this restaurant and I really hope they brush up on their act. Had I not asked about the extra charge, I wouldn't have known about it."}
{"text":"This restaurant opens 24 hours, I heard dim sum is great in the morning, however I went there after work at around 9pm, I would say their dishes at night doesn't worth the price point. I ordered a fried rice and it was just a normal fried rice with tiny pieces of pork, chicken, beef mixed together. It was $13.95. I would expect more from this place if it was $14 for a fried rice...  However I have heard good things about morning dim sum from this place and I will have to go back, maybe by that time I will update this review.    Ended up going to them for morning dim sum. It was packed and long line up... waiting for one hour.. after that, realized food was bad quality, many other dim sum places are way better. It wasn't worth for the wait and line up. I would say there was line up because it was very cheap... cheapest ever... so if you are just going for morning tea, but not the food then it's okay. I wouldn't recommend this place to people who actually wants real Yum cha."}
{"text":"3 stars for always being available, and when I'm desperate for a drink and dim sum at 2am. However, the quality of the food is mediocre and if I had a choice to go to a real dim sum place I would go there instead."}
{"text":"Service isn't that great. It's honestly hit or miss here during dim sum time which is lunch. Service does need improvement. But I go here all the time so I'm pretty used to it. Good food."}
{"text":"If I could add 0 stars, I would. This place is super disrespectful to people who have never been to a dim sum place. As we walked in, no on the acknowledged  us, so we had to wait until someone actually noticed us. The waitresses are on their phones, some of them are just snorting up the boogers while waiting for the customers to ask for service. But we got seated, at a table that was not properly set, they did not tell us the \"specials\" so we had to figure it out on our own. They literally said that we got 5 mins left to order for the special of the day, which we did not have a clue was! They did not give us a full menu, nor did they offer us drinks/tea. They did not speak to us respectfully, rather they seemed that they just wanted to end the conversation. So in short, I got fed up, left storming out of that place. Luckily, they had an Asian legend restaurant a street away.   That place is terrible with service and they honestly don't seem to care one bit. Cheap food, cheap service."}
{"text":"I am only giving this place one star, because zero stars is not an option.  I just left this place, after having waited over an hour for our food. We recieved one item (a beef dish) 40 minutes into waiting, and then had to wait another 30 for a tiny bowl of steamed rice.. That never ended up coming.   Many larger groups, with more intricate orders were seated and served after us, while we were still waiting for our food.   After over an hour of waiting we decided to just leave, and were met with terrible attitude from the manager and staff as a result.   I'd like to add, that we inquired about our food multiple times, were told they would \"check up on the status\", but never got back to us once.   Throughout our visit we were very polite, and patient, but to no avail.   I will never be coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around since antiquity.  The only saving grace of this place is that the food is good & inexpensive for dim sum.  Service is non-existent, and hence a small tip   Key points of this eatery.  1) Inexpensive 2) Open 24/7  So if you craving some dim sum on the cheap or a meal in the wee hours of the morning come to this place get your fill."}
{"text":"What a horrible restaurant.  If you've never been abuse by wait staff in a restaurant. You should try here.  Start off with the host with the Marg Simpson hair do, she only gives tables to people that are her friends,. All other paying patrons have to wait according to numbers.  The push cart ladies are so rude.  They never call out what they have because they are too busy talking & entertaining their friends.  And they let their friends play with the food on the cart til their friends are happy & satisfy with what they choose.    The food is so, so.  There are better restaurant out there without the abuse. This restaurant don't deserve a star. But I have to give one in order to get my opinion posted."}
{"text":"My first impression was \"What?! A full fledged restaurant (not diner) open 24 hours? Oh yeah! This was the first restaurant our friends took us to when we arrived late at night in Canada.  We had a great time, food was decent and they didn't bother us for staying late or taking our time eating. Food comes out hot and fresh. Typical Chinese servers, all business no smiles nor warm service. Great for big parties with lots of large round tables. Great for late night get-togethers with friends and fam without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times, so it's only right that I update my review from the last time.  Perfect restaurant dishes out your traditional Chinese dim sum.  What I mean traditional, it can be quiet loud in this controlled yet chaotic setting, and in the midst of that you've got dim sum carts going in all directions providing you some good comfort food.  The service can be quite efficient at times, and every so often you'll see the-regular patrons just helping themselves to topping up hot water into tea pots, getting take out containers, etc.  At times if a popular item comes up on a particular servers cart, all the individual has to do is just stand, as patrons will dash across the room waving their dim sum cards to ensure they get a bit of the foodie action. Overall, this place truly magnifies the original dim sum experience, however please show up early unless you like waiting in line.....for a while..."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant since I was a kid....it's always served very decent food, and they are always busy at dinner time especially on the weekends.    Quality is on and off ....some days are much much better then others.   What I mean is, sometimes the dishes I order are way smaller then other times when I order the same dish again and get 2x the food.   You never know....    The food is still tasty, just the portion sizes are ....irregular.    That's why they get 3 stars.    Otherwise, I always enjoy peking duck (though the wraps ...sometimes they are awesome, but sometimes they are dry, and other times they are a pile completely stuck together), and generally I like their lobster.  I haven't been there for dim sum though...I usually only go for dinner there."}
{"text":"Family favourite! Been coming here for more than a decade, food is decent.  Downside is people like to make themselves at home and wait inside the dining area. The restaurant has their VIPs who skip the queue.  Annoys me all the time."}
{"text":"The Dim Sum is excellent, never had a bad dish here yet.  Open 24 hours"}
{"text":"Great food at amazing prices! Went there last Saturday with 8 of my friends and ate tons of food with the bill coming to only $54 + tip. The dim sum is not high class but definitely comparable to other dim sum places in terms of quality and taste. They also had 5-6 stir fried noodles/rice dishes that most people order during dim sum for only, get ready for it, $4.50 each!!  Would have given 5 stars but their fried rice and stir fried noodles were too bland and too salty respectively. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is the most imperfect Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten at.   During my first visit here I ordered the Peking Duck. There was a straight, black hair gently resting on the top of the plate. When I called the waiter over to complain he said 'it's a duck hair'. I wish I was making that up.   He took the plate away and brought them same one back a few minutes later.   When I had the misfortune of eating here again I was overwhelmed by the poor service (had to ask four times for soy sauce after the food had arrived) and the filthy state of the washroom (not cleaned for days, piss everywhere).  Never ever going back here!"}
{"text":"Best 24 hour dim sum place around. There aren't too many around but this place beats Richmond court and rol san.  This place is my favourite for Sui Mai. There is enough parking and this place will still be busy at like 2am. That says something. The early bird dim sum prices are great too $1.50 per plate."}
{"text":"Food is below average for Toronto, the place could use a facelift and the servers could not care less about you.  Will not repeat."}
{"text":"This place has been around since the dinosaur existed. The only best part of this place is that they serve dim sum 24/7. No matter what time of day your dim sum craving starts, this is where you will get satisfied!  If you go during the day, early morning at around 8am, you will see dim sum ladies pushing around carts with dim sum on it. They do that til around afternoon time. It's actually pretty satisfying where you can see what's being served and you can actually choose which dish you want!  There are no specials whatsoever, unlike most other restaurants where before 10am, its all one price or they don't count \"tea cost\". As soon as they put the food onto the table, they will mark your card according to how much the dim sum cost.  Food isn't the best or some dishes just barely hitting the average mark. Prices isn't the cheapest either, so when your taking into consideration the worth of food with the prices, certain items don't do so well.   Tea cost is approximately $0.80 per person on weekdays. And don't even think about service, they give none. It's not a fancy place, its just a 24hr open restaurant that serves food.   I would only come back if I'm in the area and my dim sum craving is kicking in at odd times."}
{"text":"For a late night dim sum. This place is okay!  Service could be better. But the food is pretty Good. Remember you cannot pay by debit. Cash only."}
{"text":"An authentic Cantonese / Hong Kongnese dim sum experience. The food tastes fresh and delicious, and the way they push carts around to serve dim sum is how it's been done in Cantonese dim sum for decades. The unfortunate name of the restaurant is about what I expect from Chinese restaurants in general, and the quaintness adds to the authenticity.  The restaurant is always busy, so expect to line up for maybe half an hour to get a table. Once you're in though, the food is cheap! We sat for 3 hours, stuffed ourselves full, and it only cost $12 per person after tax and tips. No wonder so many people choose to dine here. And despite most Chinese restaurants being super-noisy, this one isn't! I could actually talk to people across the table from me in my normal voice.  One funny behavior I observed is that for dim sum items that people really liked, they would walk up to a cart and hand their paper over to the cart lady, instead of waiting for the cart to come around to their table. Sometimes there would be 5 different people swarming around a cart at the place where the carts emerge from the kitchen! lololol. Note that the cart-pushers yell out food names only in Cantonese. So if you only speak Mandarin or English, you've got some studying to do."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Toronto!!! Get the mixed fried rice, spicy salty shrimp and sweet and sour chicken. You'll be in heaven."}
{"text":"The best thing about this restaurant is that it opens 24 hours, and the food is good here with a very reasonable price. The only bad thing about this restaurant is that they have some waiters with bad attitudes....."}
{"text":"I was there on  Sunday afternoon and it was busy with not only Chinese customers  but all sort of nationalities come here for dim sum. They have special all day long compared  to the other high end ones which finish at 11am. They have ppl passing carts and I enjoyed to run to the carts the minute they were out to get the food that i wanted.  However,  the quality of the dim sum are just all right.  If you want good price dim sum, this is the place to be! P.S.they also have different plates of noodle and rice that you can order for $4.50 and $4.99 , pretty good deal"}
{"text":"This is a staple for my family since the turn of the century.  It's good that the price is not inflating according to economy, and we're blessed it continues to operate.  Family favorite are the noodles at 4.99 a dish for lunch.  Can't beat that anywhere else.  The dessert favorite is the mochi on a leaf.  It's delicious, as long as teeth is brushed well at the end of the day.  Dim sum is good and hot.    Word of advice is to stand up and walk to the cart pushers to grab your dim sum before they're all gone."}
{"text":"I've just starting going here, a family member recommended it to me. This is a 24 hour Chinese restaurant - Major Intersection: Brimley and Sheppard.  It's really hard to find a parking spot, but I usually park in the back because it's just a minute walk while everyone is trying to find a spot up front. The place definitely seems clean, there are always people wiping down the place and talking to you.  The two times I've went here were for take out. My first time, called in and the food took 10 minutes to be ready. I thought that was kind of ridiculous because I'd called in a half an hour before! When I got the bill though and realized how cheap it was... I didn't have any complaints.  The second time I went there was today and I went in without calling for take out. I ordered my food, paid,  and the cashier said it'd take 15 minutes... 30 minutes later or so, I'm giving the cashier a weird look and she tries not to look my way.   To be honest, keeping any business open you can't make promises you can't keep. That took double the time, and I was getting really hungry. After another 10 minutes, my food still hadn't arrived and they were all asking each other if it was packed yet... nope. It took another 5 minutes to be packed up and the girl spilled soy sauce in the bag by accident. The cashier looks our way like she's supposed to get a tip... and if the service was quick, sure why not? - But unlike my parents are, I will not tip unless I get good service. That way they'll know it doesn't just come free.  The food was decent, definitely not amazing. A lot of the food is not cut and sticks, I think they should at least cut the food. - You can tell they're either really busy or really lazy.  Far from perfect. But... it's the cheapest Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. I'll definitely be back to try the food & service without taking it home. If it wasn't this cheap, it definitely would not be worth it.  2/5"}
{"text":"Food: if you are looking for a very cheap and affordable meal for your friends and family this is definitely the place to go. All the pictures I posted were for a family of four, it could fill a family of 5-6 with tax and tip it rounds up to $67. There was a lot of variety, vegetable and meat dishes. However, with the additives you can taste the msg afterwards.   Service: food came quickly after sitting down. Waiters were nice and responded quickly to your needs. Spoke in English and Chinese.  Ambiance: traditional Chinese restaurant setting, round tables. Loud environment.   OPEN 24/7"}
{"text":"My first time ever at this restaurant.  apparently the restaurant has been around for 33 years.  I've heard about it, but just never been since no one ever told me that it tastes good... just cheap.  came today with my family because my grandma insisted.  For the price u really can't complain.  We ordered a combo for $134 for 7 dishes for 7 people including lobster, steamed fish, grilled oysters, sweet & sour pork, bok choy & mushrooms, Peking duck with the wraps.  That is around $19.14 per person, that is dirt cheap.  The food didn't exactly come out hot, lukewarm at most.  I can definitely get better quality sweet & sour pork at the food court.  The wraps for the Peking duck was pretty thick... it was like as if I was eating a tortilla.. which is very thick for a wrap for the Peking duck.  Just not my kind of my restaurant I guess.  If your not really looking for quality just a cheap eat then this is the place for you. this is a 24hour restaurant and dim sum priced at $2.  The prices here is pretty much unheard off nowadays.  Saw 1 dying or sick fish in a tank and a bellied up dead fish in another tank...kinda grosses me out.  The food isn't great at all and definitely below average, but as I said before for the price u really can't complain.  I wont be returning ever, even with the attractive pricing."}
{"text":"Not Perfect, just OK. This place good to use if you wanna eat when all restaurants closed. Good menu items but tasteless, no flavour. I think they buying Dim Sum from cheap manufacturer previously frozen, not fresh. Xiao Long Bao 100% not made fresh, frozen. Some tables stay too close to table with dirty dishes.  Probably will come back only if no any other choice"}
{"text":"As a kid, I used to come here all the time. But today, when I was craving some dim sum I decided to come give the 24/7 a try. As for my experience, this place is awful straight down from management, food and service. Aside from the long wait, the waitresses are SUPER lazy and do not do anything unless reminded multiple times. Also, they will curse behind your back cursing you in Cantonese. We waited 30ish minutes for 4/9 items with an almost empty restaurant. As for the food, it is super greasy and comes cold. This place is just terrible. Don't come here."}
{"text":"When you're craving Chinese in the wee hours of the night, this is most definitely the place that would hit the spot. Although, the deep fried chicken wings are not really to die for, the seafood chow mein surely is, as well as the deep fried spicy salt shrimp. Service is great as well, although if you are just drinking water, it's best to ask for a pitcher. This isn't the ideal place to order alcoholic beverages, not much variety and they bring the alcohol and whatever juice/pop in two separate glasses. For two entrees, the bill would come around 30$ after taxes. Make sure you have your credit card or have cash as they do not take debit."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times but for pickup only and that was many years ago... but recently I went there for dine in at 3am with a few friends. We walked in and was seated at a table that looked a little cray cray, cause the cups and dishes weren't neatly placed on the table...We decided what we wanted to order and was ready to tell the server but he said \"write it down\" and then left.. the service there was okay ... as we waited we poured tea  one of the cups had food or something strange on it . We asked them for a new one, which they asked why and we said it was dirty. So the server got one from the next table. The food came and it smelled very good, it tasted good also. I would go back one day, but for pickup only. ***sorry I don't remember the names of the food, but it was  yummy***"}
{"text":"Affordable but quality not good Not lot of selection. long line up have to go early before rush hour 11-1pm  They have the 5.99$ dish they promote but it fills you up you dont want that."}
{"text":"Two words. Terrible Service. The food was good no doubt but so are other places that sell dim sum. It took them 45 mins to get my parents and I a glass of water. We asked for a glass of water at least 10 times. After the fifth time we asked for water, the waiter decides to set up a new table not seating anyone in it. It was night time and there was atleast 4 tables with customers. Whatever you ask nothing comes out of their month. They just look, stare and once your done talking they leave, not knowing if they understood you or not. Deffinately not coming back if the customer service is like this. Worst service I have ever received in any restaurant I've been to"}
{"text":"PERFECT THEFT SKILLS!!! Terrible restaurant!!! Our waiter was dishonest and took my friends coin purse and iPhone! I will never return to this establishment ever. I suggest you watch your belongings when you dine here. They are rude and will grab any opportunity they can!!"}
{"text":"Perfect Chinese is an absolute gem. Don't let anyone deter you with their outcries for cleanliness and service. It's far from perfect and that's just perfect with me.   Perfect has always been a polarizing restaurant. But it shouldn't be. You'll find a lot of reviews critiquing it's service or food or cleanliness. They're all valid arguments, but they are missing the point. Perfect isn't your average restaurant. It's transcendent like that. Don't roll your eyes, let me explain.   Rarely do you ever see a restaurant tap into so many markets, with such a diverse range of demographics. In the morning, Perfect serves traditional dim sum, from bamboo steamers to old ladies pushing carts yelling things you don't understand. It's the whole nine yards. Here you'll find seniors, large family gatherings, and some young adults. Fast forward 6 hours, as the last cart-pushing lady dust off her red apron and leaves the floor, the place settles down from being a jam packed dim sum to a typical Chinese restaurant. No more yelling, no more seniors, just a regular restaurant. Here you'll find on the menu: $9.99 Peking duck after spending $25 or more. Like where are the margins?!!! It makes no business sense, considering $25 gets you 2 and a half dishes. See? Transcendent. Still not convinced? Let me keep going.   This place is 24/7. So as the clock strikes midnight, this Cinderella transforms to the most rachet place you know. This is a notorious place to eat after hours. Walk in anytime from 1 to 3, you'll have the place jam packed with hungry club goers looking for something to eat. You'll find only the young, or the young at heart, in this time. This is when the fun really starts at Perfect. I've witnessed a fist fight, a chase, an entire gang fight, and had a flying chair barely missed my head and smash through the window behind me. It's times like these, where you can quickly spot the regulars from the newcomers. The common reaction when people start smashing through the kitchen to get to the boarded up side of the restaurant is to run for the exit. Not for the regulars though. We tilt our heads to dodge the flying chairs, lift our plates as falling bodies drag our table cloth to the ground, and then go back to eating the shiumai.   So you tell me, knowing what you know now, would you rate Perfect like you would a typical restaurant?   Don't ever change Perfect - don't ever change."}
{"text":"Perfect Chinese Restaurant has survived, even thrived, in the everchanging Chinese food scene in Scarborough since 1984. That's how long I've been going there, even though I no longer live in the area.  They have a very extensive menu, including dim sum, available 24 hours a day. Yes, they're always open! And it seems like they're always busy, even when I've been there at 3am! They must be doing something right.  I go there mostly for dim sum, with the occasional visit for dinner and sometimes to satisfy a late night craving. The food is good, very good, but not necessarily the best I've had. Their dim sum prices are low and I would go there more often if it wasn't so crowded.  The service is inconsistent, sometimes a result of being too busy. Good food and good value available 24 hours a day, that's what makes this place Perfect!"}
{"text":"Perfect is nothing special. The fact it's open 24/7 is a bonus. The dim sum selection is massive but the dishes are ok. It's often hit or miss."}
{"text":"Veeery long line up for dim sum. I found out afterwards that it was because of how cheap it was. Came here with 4 adults and the bill came up to about 30 dollars and we were pretty full. The place was very typical of a chinese restaurant. Not the cleanest nor the most refined, but for cheap eats, its not bad. We ordered the typical dim sum dishes: chicken feet, hargow, dumpling, beef balls, etc. All items were mediocre. Nothing really stood out, but I guess the popularity is for its price."}
{"text":"The place is alright. It's open 24 hrs, which is one of the only great things about it. I feel like the servers are a lil crabby, probably because they're here all night long. Food is average at most, if not less. My advice is to come here as a last resort between 2-5AM. At least they give fortune cookies with the bill!"}
{"text":"Food is not that great here. Busy and cheap but I would recommend you go across the street at oriential mall to try to dim sum.  Short beef rib is covered all with oil and fat. Only dim sum stands out is the fries fitter with shredded pork inside"}
{"text":"Mediocre. Came here for the dim sum but not during a late night drunken state. It was a respectable 8PM on a Sunday and we just felt like a paper tablecloths kinda place. Plus, I never say no to dim sum.  It was decent, but wish they had more of a selection. The eggplant was my highlight."}
{"text":"My brother found a piece of plastic in his soup.  My dad tells the waiter (I think? He didn't have a vest on...) and he just looks at it, then takes it away without even an apology.  Quite the disappointment, but one person isn't enough to ruin the entire restaurant to me, yet.  The other staff is quite nice."}
{"text":"Rating: 4.5/5 stars.  My family and I have been coming here for years and it's guaranteed authentic Chinese food.   I would strongly recommend these menu items: Deep Fried Beef with Spicy Salt (cooked to perfection); Cantonese Fried Noodle (lots of seafood and the noodles are always crispy); Sliced Chicken with Ginger & Pineapple (such great balance and so flavourful); Fried Baby Chinese Green with Garlic (tender, yet crispy); and Sauteed Scallops (cooked just right and they add fresh Chinese vegetables).  It can be a long wait sometimes to get a table but, when you do, they don't rush you out of there like some other places.  My only complaint is the visible fish tank so I try to avoid sitting close to that."}
{"text":"The price is great, but only eat there if you have a stomach of steel. Four of us met up for brunch last Saturday and we ALL managed to get sick that afternoon. I don't think it's a coincidence for four people to all feel sick at the same time."}
{"text":"Went to Perfect Chinese for new years eve dinner.  It was my first time at this restaurant eventhough it's been around for ages.    The food was just ok, but the service was good and staff was friendly.  We ordered lobster and they kept changing our plates and providing napkins without us having to ask.  Also free soup and red bean dessert as with many chinese restaurants.  I noticed they cater to non-asians as they greeted us in English and asked if we needed a fork.  I have not yet tried their dim sum but I hear it's cheap and worth checking out.  They do not have warm running water in the bathrooms unfortunately, so my hands were ice cold after washing my hands (ate lobster with hands today).  I was told by another patron that it's always been like that at this restaurant.  I also noticed it is open 24 hours which is quite unique for a chinese restaurant in GTA.  Will keep this place in mind next time we are hungry for late night Chinese food."}
{"text":"If you're ever hungry late at night, you can always count on Perfect as it's open 24hours.  Dined here at midnight with my friends and ordered five dishes.  The food here is standard compared to other Chinese restaurants.  They usually give free soup and red bean for dessert when you order \"family style\".  However they ran out that night when we dined in."}
{"text":"RATING 3.5  Service is always a hit or miss. I find it's either the waiters either ignore you or are diligent in serving you, never in between.   Food - I've been here for both dimsum service and their regular dinner. The food is good and the dumplings are delicious. My most recent visit I had their shrimp dumplings (ha gow) and shrimp fried rice, I can honestly say I've had better but their dishes were not bad. I prefer their dimsum service because of the better assortment of foods.  Overall, I only come here if I'm with a friend who wants to get Chinese in Scarborough."}
{"text":"The food quality is great and they're always busy, however their service can be improved. Be warned, the line to get a seat can take ages."}
{"text":"I regularly come here for weekend dimsum with the folks, and we just love it!   Extensive menu, convenient 24 hour service, and a set of friendly employees - can't complain...a regular go-to!"}
{"text":"24 hour chinese restaurant right underneath my nose and didn't even know it was there. There is even dim sum 24/7. The food was good and the prices very fair. The place was clean and service was great."}
{"text":"This place is usually packed, doesn't matter what day, especially dim sum during lunchtime.  Food is good but the customer service is crappy but it all depends on the servers. We don't go to Asian restaurants for their service, we go for the food. When you tip less than 15% due to crappy service, they ask why you give them such little tips. Maybe they should step up their customer service and we'll tip them more. They have no phone etiquette or know what customer service is.  Sadly enough, my parents like traveling across the city (North York to Scarborough) to eat here. It's our default dim sum restaurant."}
{"text":"Writing this review on my friend's behalf. First, food quality is  ok, but the price is the lowest in North America, NO kidding, according to the waiter. Second, it is in a 30 yrs mall so the location/venue is not too cool. Third, most customers are Asians, not Chinese. If you are in that area, you need to check it out!  Average quality dim sum in N. Ca  will cost 3 times. Things in Canada now is 35 % discount. By the way flight from Boston to Toronto later this year is $ 165.00, to SFO cost is $ 167.00. Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Not good dim sum and worst service in GTA. The steam carrot cake was very rubbery like it was reheat/left-over food...etc.In terms of service, four of us with a baby were seated in the centre of the room. After sitting down, we were told to squeenze cause we blocked dim sum carts. They could'd hv guided us to a corner table insead of a closet table. Also, not everything on the menu was avaible. They wouldn't tell you what was not available when you ordered. Once ordered, they simply told you they couldn't cancel the order and forced you to order something else . Felt like we were ripped off. Never gonna come back again"}
{"text":"I've been coming for years cause it's a decent late night eatery (open 24 hours) and serves dim sum all day.. I come back hoping they would improve some way some how.. I guess that's asking a bit much.. :p  With the dim sum where the have the cart, runs between 9am-2pm but after that you'll be ordering dim sum off a piece of paper..  I tend to go late at night with my group of friends. I never go there with less then 5 people and its always a mix group..   I will admit the service there is very horrendous.. They're rude and unhappy.. Yes we tend to sit at a bigger table meant for double the people we have but there's reason to our madness.. We always order over 10 dishes minimum, so we need the space but yet we get frown upon.. I go there quite often with my best friend who happens to be Jamaican, gotta the love the looks I get from them lol.. The fact I'm with him and a mix group we automatically get forks?  They all can use chopsticks better then I can and I'm Asian lol.. At times we get dirty plates, cups and utensils and we'll just set that aside..  Food can be a hit or miss there.. We rarely order outside our usually items when were there.. The spicy & salty shrimp, spicy & salt tofu, beef and mushroom on crispy noodles, mushroom and tofu veg, Singapore noodles  are the things we tend to order again and again..   Overall you get what you pay for and it's cheap Chinese food what else can you say.."}
{"text":"Been coming to Perfect for many years.  I can always count on them to be open when I'm visiting my in-laws in Scarborough and provide the late night Dim Sum.  Being from Mississauga, this is a cut above the Tremendous restaurant on Wolfdale Road because of the Dim Sum.  We went on Monday night as it was my Sister-In-Law's 29th birthday.  I cannot go wrong with my usual order of BBQ Pork Bun and Pork Spring Roll.  Hey, it's not the greatest in the world but for the price and in the late hours, totally sold!  I usually get a plate of E-Fu Noodles to go with it.  As for the customer service, the waiters will get you what you want, just as long as you flag them down and let them know once or twice about your order.  For this place, go for the food, not the service!"}
{"text":"Is the food awesome? No. But this place is the only 24 hour Chinese restaurant and it serves both dim sum and full course dinner meals. It's been around for decades and the quality has not changed one bit. The prices almost seem static too. Usually come once or twice a year to eat their Peking duck dinner combo which is always good. Staff are friendly but hard to get their attention as they are always a full house."}
{"text":"Customers coming here for Father's Day lunches HEED my advice:     come earlier than 10am, otherwise, be prepared to wait +30min for a table to be open for you.     Variety of food is good but it takes a long stretch for a new food-trolley to come around. Advice - ONLY ORDER 1 dish of anything, never order 2x. This is dim sum, after all. Food here fills up your stomache quick, so ordering 2 (even if delicious or not enough portions) is going to take away the experience.     Room decor, table space, and cutlery standards are all good.     I recommend going into this restaurant with positive vibes, otherwise you set yourself up for disappointment.  Recommend: yes"}
{"text":"Open 24/7.....staple in Scarborough. ..dim sum is crazy so go early or be prepared to wait in a long crowded line.....been going here for years.  Oh ya....they sell soft shell crab.......so delicious!"}
{"text":"When visiting from out of town it always amazes me of the different places you can eat. At Perfect Chinese Restaurant I love how the servers come around with carts bearing different kind of steamed goodies, from steamed dumplings, spring rolls, steamed buns , and sweet treats etc. Decision , decision when deciding on what to try first. It is worth a visit if you are up to chasing a food cart for something to eat."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years 24 hours 7 days a week. This place has one of the best dim sums I have ever had in my life. Starting off with harrow which is a shrimp dumpling then shrimp rolls octopus legs. I will come back here for genrations amazing food"}
{"text":"Sunday Dim Sum for $10 per person? Add on top of it that the food is good?! Sign me in!   The setting is a no frills dinning room with no frills service. Staff are walking around with carts, you pick the dish you want and they add it to your bill. Food is freshly cooked and they have a good selection.   Staff is not the most outgoing but they do their job well and serve you promptly.  Arrive early or expect a 45 min wait to get a table."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious and the price is very reasonable.  The first few times I went here with friends I was in shock when the bill came!  For 3 of us, we paid a little over $20 and we were all really full.  Why the 2 stars? Their service is horrible.  We like to have hot sauce with our dim sum, so give it to us!  They have ignored multiple requests for hot sauce at this place, really, we ask for it... and it just doesn't come, then we ask for it again... and it doesn't come again.  When it finally comes, we get a little bowl filled to about 1/4 with hot sauce for 7 people.  We finish it, and then we ask for more and then the process repeats itself.  Once we asked for the entire hot sauce bottle, but they didn't give it to us.  We're not hot sauce fiends, we just want enough for the 7 of us.  On one occasion where the hot sauce did not come and the tea was not refilled, we decided to give a lousy tip (5%).  The waitress chased us down and told us to put more money.  So rude, I would have said \"no\", but my boyfriend was nice enough to leave a bit more.  I was really angry after leaving the restaurant.  If my friends would like to come back to this place, I'd go but I wouldn't suggest it or venture out here just to have some cheap dim sum anymore."}
{"text":"This is the Chinese restaurant I go to when I want good food for a good price. My favourite thing here is the peking duck. The pancake may not be the thinnest but it's still delicious. You can get the peking duck for $8.88 if you spend $20 there which should be easy if you're going in a group of 4 or more. Another great thing about this restaurant is that they give you free soup and dessert when you dine there for dinner.  I also love coming here for lunch or dim sum. If you go during the morning/lunch rush, the dim sums come in carts. If you go outside of the dim sum rush, you can fill out a piece of paper for your dim sums. Be aware of long line ups during the rush though!  Lastly, don't get fooled into sitting in the nicer part of the restaurant (the room behind the bar) because the dim sums are more expensive by approximately $0.30 per dish. You don't need to worry about seating for dinner because the prices are the same."}
{"text":"The food: Decent Chinese restaurant food. Everything is well seasoned. I like the Peking duck the most. The waiter sliced the duck paper thin in front of my table. It looks pretty neat and decorative.   The price: the price was fair and not too expensive.   The service: Generally speaking is fine. We ordered lobsters so they should've given us some wet napkins beforehand. It wasn't busy at all. We went late night, but it still takes a long time for them to respond."}
{"text":"this restaurant is far from perfect.  what kind of restaurant DOES NOT accept credit cards?!  apparently this chinese restaurant doesn't accept it when you order special prefixed dinners.  the boss was not able to provide a clear answer as to why they didn't accept it either.   no one wants to carry $300+ around if they don't have to.  it's not practical for their business to accept credit card for all other items on their menu except the prefixed dinners.  food arrived late and cold.  the dishes came out too far apart and we were sitting around thinking dinner was done.  they kept adding water to the tea leaves, never giving us fresh leaves.  if i can give this restaurant 0 stars, i would!"}
{"text":"I have frequented this restaurant with friends/family for 10 ++ years , late night drinking would result in us eating at 3-5am at perfect chinese restaurant  it is true the service is awful, at 3-5am sometimes you suck it up because there just isnt much choices at that time.    Today was the straw that broke the camels back, i was with my girlfriend early afternoon it started with dirty chop sticks with dried vegetables stuck on it  then we asked 3x times for a fork, 4x times for napkins, another 4x times for some winchester sauce that comes with spring rolls.    They gave us VERY watery plum sauce for the spring rolls; it was disgusting just like most of there dim sum.  Finally after asking the manager; who then asked one of the same waitresses for the sauce again, she drops the sauce on our table, points to the disgusting plum sauce speaking in chinese RUDELY to us that we already have plum sauce as if we were not allowed .  My girlfriend politely with sarcasim says we enjoy it with winchester sauce.  i cant believe how rude that waitress is, when the bill came 23.28$ i made it a point to leave no tip.  ***what you can expect at perfect chinese restaurant*** --awful service --waitress/waiters who will make you feel that you shouldnt eat here --dirty utensils --terrible food  you've been warned (again for the 100th time)"}
{"text":"Ive been here before with my friend and it was okay. I didnt like how they didnt accept interac. However, I like how there are open 24hrs a day."}
{"text":"Overall, a good dim sum experience. Unless you arrive super early, you'll likely have to get a number and wait for a table. Expect a 30-40 minute wait on a busy Sunday afternoon. Food is hot and fresh, and comes out in carts. You can also order individual items from the waiter. The service, as expected, isn't the best from a no-frills restaurant like this, but the prices more than makeup for this. Depending on the time you go, prices are as low as $1.80/dish, some of the cheapest I've seen for dim sum in Toronto.   Cash/Visa only."}
{"text":"This long time Scarborough establishment is best described as a tale of two worlds....    Seniors and young families during the day and a young and hunger clubbing crowd at 3am in the morning. A 24 hour restaurant that serves dim sum during the day via carts and made to order at night.  Frequented by all types of nationalities that crave things like chicken feet and beef intestines to sweet and sour pork and chicken fried rice..  A super busy restaurant in a empty and decrepit mall... You get the picture...  The restaurant serves all kind of primarily Cantonese cuisine and seafood.  Over the years they undergone many renovations to the restaurant with the newest reno being the additional room that was added outside the main dining room for private parties and karaoke.  Can't have a Chinese restaurant without karaoke now can we?    Prices though have steadily increased as they are gradually making Perfect into a higher end restaurant so it's no longer the hole in the wall restaurant it once was.    One side of the room is cheaper priced, the other side more expensive.  Food is good but not great. Service is quick but not always courteous.  Again Perfect Chinese Restaurant is a tale of two worlds:)"}
{"text":"I've been to the Perfect Restaurant twice now for dim sum and liked it both times. They have push carts for dim sum but the inconvenient thing is you have to wait for it to pass by and they don't always have what you want. The food was good and great price. The dim sum experience makes me raise my rating to 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place has been a Scarborough institution for a long time. It's open 24 hours which is a rarity on the east side. I think people are generally worried on cultural authenticity and taste for Chinese restaurants. This place is confusing because it has the grand set meals, one all Chinese menu but also has Chinese take out type food...like egg rolls and mushu stuff. We ordered typical Cantonese style dishes. One standout was the HK style Angus filets. They were very meaty and tender and the flavor was good. The cashew chicken stir-fry dish had different veggies than what I'm used to seeing and it was fine. The bird's nest dish was super oily so couldn't really enjoy the nest itself.As for everything else it was only okay. Definitely a good choice if you're looking for all night eats. I think they might be trying to do too much so everything is acceptable versus exceptional."}
{"text":"Tried this place twice. Once for dim sum and once for dinner. Dinner was meh. Food was super oily and they put a lot of MSG for sure because I was finding myself gulping down tea every few minutes, and the meal made me feel like a grease ball afterwards. Service for dinner was alright because it wasn't too busy but it is absolutely terrible for dim sum. Dim sum is not cheap and quality is pretty crap in my opinion and I've tried many different dim sum places in the GTA. Not to mention, dishes and tables/ chairs/ floor were extremely dirty. The worse thing about my entire experience was the customer service. The servers seemed like they hated their job and didn't want to attend to customers and when we were finally able to call them down, it seemed like they were doing us a favour by serving us. When we left, we weren't happy with the service so we just gave them a standard 10% tip and they had the nerve to stop us and tell us it wasn't enough. I mean what? First of all, the amount of tip is definitely not fixed or mandatory and based on customer service experience for sure. I've seen people who give less than 10% tip based on customer service experience at many Chinese restaurants because they were simply undeserving. Then we added $1 and they looked and counted the bill and said it STILL wasn't enough. That was complete BS because we had already given $2 for a $20 bill, so a total of $3 for a $20 bill...but we didn't want to make a scene because people were watching so we threw down another couple quarters and left. The waiters were definitely greedy for money but their service and attitude was absolute crap. For $1-2 they have lost a customer and many more customers because I'm definitely gonna save all my friends and family of the shitty experience from this place."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time but ever since the health and safety shut down, haven't been here in a while. But cheap food and typical Chinese restaurant. Authentic and good tasting. If they are as clean as they should be and they stopped their unsanitary ways since the inspection, I would definitely come back. But that health inspection really made me a bit more skeptic."}
{"text":"24 hour dim sum?  This must be heaven.  This place is HUGE and it was packed!  They have the typical fish tank with fat lobsters for you to stare at while you wait to be seated.  They gave us a number and yelled for us when our table was ready.    I have to give them props for their lobster.  It is DELICIOUS.  My grandmother is 89, so she's had a lot of time to try different Chinese places and she said, \"that really IS perfect Chinese food.\""}
{"text":"This has been a lot time go-to spot for my family on our 'Hey let's gather everyone and go out for Dim Sum' days.  Their prices are reasonable for the portions you get (typically in numbers of 3-4 or a small ceramic plate, etc.). It comes in about $2~3 per dish depending on what you order, and then a small charge for tea which is now standard for most places.  As for taste, it ends up tasting the same after a bit and I honestly have to say it's average tasting and nothing really fantastic. Above average, at most.   For our family, feeding a party of five adults often amounts up to about $40 or so, making it cheaper than other places we've been too (& that number is high to start with!). On weekends and holidays, it's jammed PACKED with wait times ranging anywhere near 30 minutes to an hour, so planning accordingly is highly recommended.  I'd suggest it! :)"}
{"text":"Probably the only place I know of that offers 24/7 dim sum. I'll be honest, the waiters are pretty rude there but I honestly can't blame them because I see other customers treating the staff there terribly. Otherwise food is great!"}
{"text":"Please Have The option of negative star please Yelp.  Is this the garbage food or from the prison? Please treat your your body right by not eating here. I felt really really terrible because my body doesn't deserve this kind of food. The food is full of fat and chemical smell.  The tea is no taste and to Mark it's so dirty and is was 1 dollar and 50 Cent and they wouldn't tell you about . Give me a lit bit better tea I will pay 5$ no problem.  No EYE CONTACT with the staffs. They just scare of you. Lol .  Never wrote any review here but I need to safe the world. You worked hard for your $, please dont throw them here."}
{"text":"This used to be our go to dim sum place but we gave up because of the weekend lineups and the ignorant patrons rushing around trying to grab dishes off the carts like a starving hoard of morons.    Anyway, today, a weekday the place was much calmer although some of those patrons were present but a little less obnoxious than before.  The dishes themselves were good, not necessarily great, although the beef balls were very tasty and the Ha Gow contained nice plump shrimp but the wrapper was a little doughy. Service was good overall. 8 dishes and a take out beef and noodles came to a little over $22 ($2 a dish for dim sum, probably a bit higher on weekends) With many places pricing out their dim sum as S,M,L, XXL at prices ranging from $2.80-$5 this place is probably one of the cheapest places in Scarborough. I'll definitely be back but I'll confine my visits to weekdays for a little more relaxed dining experience. If you are new to this place I would suggest avoiding the weekend crush!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is 24/7 I have been here serveral times.. not very recommended during night time around 1am -7am unless you have to come. Cuz the food is not very fresh.. some of the the fried squid I had in the plate today has gone bad and I guess they mixed the old with the new ones. The price is decent and taste is decent as well.. a typical 2.5-3 star restaurant I would say. The service is good sometimes. I remember you need to lineup from outside to dine in here since the pice used to be super cheap.. but now they changed it and I don't see line up anymore. The environment is a bit crowded. Tables are scattered around randomly and some seats are too close to each other. I only tried the dim sum here so not sure what there dinner menu is like. Overall just a typical restaurant if you wanna spend less money or when you have to find a restaurant during night time or early morning."}
{"text":"If I could give this rating a 0 or a negative rating I would. Honestly, coming there, being seated for like 20 mins and no carts come by with anything is absolutely ridiculous. They push the carts on the other side of the restaurant where it's more pricier so they earn more profit. With the lack of customer service that they have, I would never go back."}
{"text":"I used to come here after a night out. They're open 24 hours and honestly their food is good enough so that at those times you really appreciate them haha it tastes amazing especially when you can't get dimsum anywhere else late at night. That being said they only get 3 stars simply because there are some better dim sum places out there"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best for dimsum.  It's a very popular restaurant as it was jampacked at 8pm on a Sunday night. We ordered dimsum and a Noodle dish which took about 30 min to come, one at a time. That is a lot longer than usual dimsum places, but given how busy it was I can understand.   We got the shrimp rolls (kind of like spring rolls) and they were pretty good. The har gow was really mushy on the outside making it very sticky. The sui mei was bland, didn't have much taste to it. The custard bun was horrible. It was like chewing paper; in fact my boyfriend didn't even know there was paper and was eating it, after he realized the mistake he said there was absolutely no difference between eating the paper and the bao itself. The spare ribs were as expected. Dimsum averaged between $2.80-$4 each  Also ordered a shanghai Noodle beef and pork which was alright. A bit greasy but clearly better than the dimsum. $10   Service is like a typical Chinese restaurant. Very rushed and you may need to repeat yourself for water or hot sauce a couple of times before it arrives.   Overall if I'm desperate for a dimsum fix late at night (its 24hours) then I guess I'll swing by here. But for any other reason, just find another place... Like Fancy Chinese restaurant in Markham."}
{"text":"In all honesty this restaurant is always the LAST resort. There will always be a better restaurant until past 11 PM when everywhere else is closed. I'm always in the area so Perfect always pop ups when someone is hungry. It is a Scarborough landmark and is open 24 hours. People are drawn to order from their 24/7 dim sum menu. I have been eating here once and a while for over 10 years.  With some menu items, there is no space for error like congee or anything deep fried. Consistent and simple. The complex dishes, such as chow mein, will come with different recipes/ingredients depending on today's cook.  The service is a whole different story. It's clear that the waiters are overworked and find little happiness or meaningfulness in their job because they are stern and interact as minimally as possible with guests. Almost as if they have so many horror stories between difficult customers, which I'm sure is all too often considering they get the night owls with post-partying munchies, that they do not care for the impression they leave on guests. Servers I recognize have worked here for years always appear pissed off.  On one occasion, I waited over 45 minutes between 2 dishes in a single order. It was thrown onto my table with bad attitude because I checked up on its status with the servers twice. I didn't leave a tip when paying. Without thanks and after counting the money in front of us the server raised her voice saying \"NO TIP?\". Yes, no tip! I don't tip shit service.  Another day, I came in at 6AM. There were 2 other guests in the restaurant. All was fine and well until I caught sight of a staff picking up GARBAGE including dirty tissue and bones off the floor with KITCHEN TONGS! And no they were not marked \"tongs for garbage\", there must have been tons of the same kind used for food! And then we flipped the lid of our tea pot to request more tea, and there was what looked like dark crusted slimy tea leaves or mold on the underside of the lid.  There is a serious negligence for the health and safety at this restaurant and I can't imagine the state of cleanliness at the back of house/kitchen where your food is cooked. Sadly people aren't able to see this far, or at least at how poorly its owners operate this business and will continue to dine here."}
{"text":"I went to this Chinese place for my brunch this morning. When we got there, there were already a queue, and my friend got no 10. We decided not to wait, and we told the waiter that we could share with others, and so we moved in. We got some porridge, chicken feet, dim sum and some other foods, and it was very cheap, costing only 23.5 Canadian dollars, and the food were pretty good."}
{"text":"A friend of ours from Hong Kong recommended this restaurant as the best in the city to enjoy Chinese style lobster crab and fish at a reasonable price. After reading reviews, we opted to come on a weekday lunchtime so it would be less busy. Good decision, we just sat waiting 10 - 15 minutes. We enjoyed the unlimited Chinese green tea while waiting for the dim sum trays to arrive.   They tend to use celery in most dishes with vegetables including the shrimp dumplings. Other Asian restaurants we've been to tend to use green onions or chives in the dumplings instead of celery.     I didn't mind doing it, because we had come at lunchtime, the traditional dim sum time instead of dinnertime, but we needed to call a waitress over to order something other than dim sum. We then needed to give the numbers off the takeout menu so my daughter & I could try the spicy fried lobster I had read so much about, & so hubby could have his 2 faves, hot and sour soup--the small will easily fill 4 - 6 cups servings-- and chicken and cashews, so piping hot and you can taste the fresh ginger. Everything was well spiced and delicious, dim sum very reasonably priced. I'm so glad I finally got to try this place and we're coming back to try more seafood and their black pepper beef."}
{"text":"This truly is the perfect chinese restaurant for dim sum. You won't find many places with dim sum carts nowadays! I think mainly due to health concerns after SARS, many have switched to ordering by pen and paper.   Depending on when you go, dishes are either $1.70 or $1.90 each, we were told the most expensive dish is only $2.50! If you don't feel like having dim sum or simply want fried rice or noodles, it's $4.50 off the lunch menu!   This restaurant has been around for quite some time and I think it might be the only 24 hr dim sum place in TO. Having said that, they obviously don't have the dim sum carts during the wee hours of the night, and prices will also be significantly more as each are made to order. I was also told that only normal dim sum dishes will me offered, no specialty items.   So if you decide to give this a chance, you better arrive 30-40 mins earlier because there's a lineup every time I went!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for many years still love there dim sum like always have to come early to get a seat if come here at lunch be prepared to wait for a long time also pack a small lunch bag that's how long you be waiting for"}
{"text":"The wait staff is friendly, if you're Chinese that is. Sometimes the cooks brings out the food and they always seem to be grumpy. Otherwise, it's your typical Chinese food."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for years. It's cheap dim sum, and for the price, it's pretty good. They have quite a variety but only serve everything when it's busy (ie. Saturday mornings)- otherwise they serve limited types of dishes. Service varies depending on your server or cart lady. They aren't always friendly but if you don't mind that, it's a good place to come for cheap food."}
{"text":"Perfect is a (somewhat) staple of Scarborough. Anytime you need decent food, you can go here and get something. May not be the healthiest, but decent.  The location, a little tacky and really has a hole-in-the-wall vibe. Not sure if it is the best way to describe it, but considering I have been here at all times of the day and night (ie 3am), you see a lot. It is a place where at 3am, after clubbing, you will find the drunk or danced out people hunched over eating food. Pretty fun to watch at times.  The food is okay, not the greatest but can hit the spot. I love the deep fried tenticles and har gow to start. They are usually on spot. The peaking duck is really good if you feel like spending the money or have a decent group of people. Otherwise, get the sizzling satay beef or spare ribs. Dim sum during the day. And yes, they serve beer. Usually you can fill up on about $15-$20 per person.  Be warned about the late night visits though. There can be some interesting things that occur. If you are expecting posh, this place is not for you."}
{"text":"NOT Perfect. Boy these restaurants really set themselves up for disappointment with their names.  Slow ass service during dinner. Seriously some of the worst I've ever experienced at a restaurant anywhere. You've been warned.  Always busy, probably because of their relatively cheap prices. Their dim sum is pretty standard but comes out much quicker than their dinner plates. Seriously, do yourself a favour and avoid the dinner.  It is open 24 hrs, so if you have a craving for not perfect Chinese food in the middle of the night this place might be worth a shot."}
{"text":"Had 1.5lb lobster w/ ginger and green onion, scrambled egg w/ shrimp, salt and pepper pork cutlets, and some veggies. Came to $56 and change. Dessert was 'sugar water'. Milky tapioca stuff. lol. I liked it. It wasn't busy on a monday night around 8pm. Service was good, food came fast and also tasted better than I was expecting compared to my previous visits here which are usually for dimsum at like 3 or 4am with drunk people."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times. The prices are good and I use this place to judge other dim sum places. Coming on weekends is the best time to come around 10 or 11am. It'll be busy then but it's worth it because of the variety they offer. A lot of the more expensive dim sum such as quail and deep fried chicken wings are offered at this time. You can always be surprised when coming because you don't know what to expect. If you do want a quick breakfast then coming around 8am is great because they have a paper based menu where you can just order what you want. Service is good and if you're a regular customer the servers do remember you. I would recommend this place for people that want quick food, want to be surprised, cheap dim sum and okay service."}
{"text":"It's 24 hours. The place to go if you want chinese food and everything else is closed. It's a scarborough thing to go here to be honest."}
{"text":"I don't get this place. The dim sum crowd is always ridiculous and the food quality isn't great. I suppose people just come because it caters to the neighborhood and has cheap pricing for large portions. However, I enjoy my dim sum experiences only when it's a relaxed, quiet atmosphere - rather than having to sit at a table having someone's behind standing right in front of it as they wait for their own seat.   Anyways, asides from the dim sum, I came here at midnight with some friends. I ordered some potstickers, and to my surprise, there was a very obvious strand of hair lying beside it in the oil. I saw this as the waiter was putting it down the table. I told them what I saw and that I didn't want it. The waiter had the nerve to argue with me that he didn't see it, until I had to pick the hair up with a chopstick. After that, I canceled my order and left. This place is definitely to be avoided in my books."}
{"text":"This not even close to perfect,  this was my first and last time I will never eat at this resturant again.   The food is not terrible but I wouldn't say it's good either.  We had an order of deep squid, some pieces were over seasoned and some were bland, like they just threw some salt in and didn't mix it at all.    The service however is TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE even. 1 of 3 of the waiters just seemed like he had better things to do then serve.  The other 2 were fine, but the worst was the MANAGER!  Rude and unresponsive gestures,  he literally walked away from us while we were asking him to follow up on our order, which took over half an hour.    Never again and I do not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Perfect Chinese Restaurant has been around for ages, even decades!   It is far from Perfect but as a 24 hour business it does survive because where can you get some Chinese food in the middle of the night in Scarborough? But... for sure Perfect will not be the place for me... can I say I rather going to bed on my empty stomach?   Prices here for dim sum is dirt cheap $1.50 for all sizes All Day weekday and weekends are $1.80. The specials are from 7 AM, great if you have to work early..   I don't expect much services in cheap Chinese restaurant. I can live with servers throwing things on our tables. I can stand the plastic table cover where all my plates are sliding everywhere. I can understand that the quality of food will not be as good with the price they are charging! What I cannot stand is lukewarm to room temperature dim sum!   Shrimp Rice Roll - not only cold, the shrimps inside was like hard.  Pan Fried Turnip Cake - cold and oily.  Chicken Feet - lukewarm  Siu Mai - lukewarm  Har Gor- The only one that is tasty and hot   Now I am more than happy to pay more at other dim sum places at least I know my food is hot and steamy.. and I can even complain to the manager if they are not up to par...  1.5 stars with 1 star goes to the fact they are open 24/7"}
{"text":"This place might be the only Chinese restaurant in the area that's open 24 hours a day! 24 hours of delicious, cheap noodle and rice dishes, 24 hours of à la carte dim sum, and 24 hours for it to be crowded.  I say that because the place is crazy during dim sum time on the weekends, and sometimes even during the week. It's in a tiny strip mall just west of Brimley off of Sheppard, and there is next to NO parking. You may have to fight for a spot, or you could just make your own spot like a lot of people do in this lot (not cool).  They're your typical Chinese restaurant -- banquet-style dining, white tablecloths, a menu full of traditional Chinese food. They'll bring you a pot of tea, and if you need a fork, you might have to ask for it (sometimes they judge and will just bring you a fork if you're not Chinese).  But it's good food, at decent prices, and the fact that I can get dim sum whenever I want is pretty enticing. I remember I came here a week after I got my wisdom teeth taken out and ate my first solid food since the surgery -- some delicious har gow and chun fun, and I was so tempted by the rice that I ate some and got it stuck in the holes at the back of my mouth. See, the food is so good that you'll even want to eat some when you're in unbearable pain.  I believe they do take-out as well, which is a better option on those days when there's a lineup out the door!"}
{"text":"Decent dim sum, but nothing special to rave about. Good value though at $1.80 per dish on weekdays and after 2 PM on weekends. ($2.00 before 2 PM on weekends.) This place is ridiculously packed on weekends, so be prepared to wait a while or consider sharing a table with some strangers. Busy on weekdays around lunch time too. Good to come here if you're just looking for cheap, standard dim sum to fill you up without all the frills. In general I find the skin on their dumplings to be too sticky, so not a fan of those. But it's good that they offer 24 hr dim sum, so you can always get your fix."}
{"text":"For quick Chinese food at any time this is the spot.  You must try the spicy shrimp. Can never go wrong with this dish.   This place is not the fanciest restaurant but the food is delicious."}
{"text":"The food here can be good but sometimes it's just average. Definitely try the fish and the very cheap peking duck special. The garlic snow pea shoots tend to be good.  Be prepared for a long wait though as there are always long line ups here. The poor service is what really kills this place. And there's one particular waiter that really outdoes the rest of them in terms of rudeness. His name is Jacky and he's the one that has a tuft of hair at the front that's dyed blonde. He is VERY rude and he constantly tries to kick you out of the table if the restaurant is busy by standing closeby and insisting that he pack your takeaway for you. Because of that horrible man alone, I'm boycotting this place now.  Edit: Unfortunately, some friends of mine insisted on going to this place. I warned them but they didn't listen. We ordered the fish, the garlic snow pea shoots, some tofu dish and the peking duck. The peking duck was filled with fat for some reason and the fish we got was definitely not fresh. It was very mush and frankly horrible. We brought this up with the waiter at the end of the dinner and he insisted it was fresh! Of course. Service was horrible throughout the dinner as well as usual. One waitress was especially rude and of course Jacky, the master of crude, was there again to make our dinner pleasant. We decided to leave tip reflecting the service and the fish. The waitress (the rude one) actually had the gall to bring the bill back to us and ask us for more tip! Hahaha! Gosh, these people make me angry. I'm Chinese so I underestand that customer service is last priority at Chinese restaurants, but these guys are just unbelievable."}
{"text":"The go to spot if my friends and I are hungry late night. They are open 24/7 which can be a good thing.   Came here the other night, the servers are pretty rude, which made me not want to come back. The food is okay, but definitely tasted better. I feel like the food didn't have much of a taste.   2 stars only because this was one of the only restaurants open around 1:30am, we got a table pretty quick and it was close to home. Other than that, the service was horrible and food was okay. I definitely had better."}
{"text":"Best Dim sum places after hours haha  This is where me and my friends go at 2 am and decide what we should do with our lives"}
{"text":"Had to get my fix tonight so went to this place (been here many times) and decided to order take out.   Ordered the Cantonese chow mein. Around $14 total. Portion is good and the veggies and meat is good. Pricey for a dish like this BUT it's 24 hours so I guess it was okay. This dish is alright and would order it again.   Regarding the dim sum, there are other places much better. Not recommended if you want dim sum unless it's late and you are craving for some."}
{"text":"All the food here looks better than it actually is, and having been here multiple times, I can say that with certainty. The meat isn't as tender as I feel it should be; the vegetables aren't very fresh; and the service here is below average.   I would not return nor recommend this place, but seeing as how it's survived all these years in a dying plaza, their saving grace is probably the fact that they run 24/7."}
{"text":"I will often go for dim sum here.  They use a traditional trolley service which is nice. However, the food quality isn't that great, but then again you're not paying too much for them -- $2 a dish.   Tip: if you go for dim sum in the afternoon (past 2:30pm), dishes are $1.80. Also, make sure you get the beef rice noodle (not a dim sum dish but a lunch dish which you can order during dimsum). It has an authentic wok taste!"}
{"text":"Dimsum at the Perfect Restaurant has always been very good and cheap, which is probably why there's always a long line up whenever i went there during the weekends. It's a large restaurant that opens 24 hours a day.  During the day, servers would push dimsum carts around the restaurant.  For some reasons, diners would go up to the carts to get the dimsum dishes before the carts get to their tables.  I guess this is because everyone is afraid the dishes would ran out.  In some cases that's what would happen.  But even when that happens, you can order specifically from a waiter and have the dish delivered to your table.  I really do like having the carts being pushed around with the servers calling out the names of the dimsum dishes being offered.  It keeps up with the dimsum tradition that is slowly disappearing in other restaurants. Seriously, try not to be put off with the crazy line to be seated.  It is well worth it, and patience is rewarding."}
{"text":"You've changed bro...first thing I thought when I walked in after not going for about a year.   This placed is rammed, the service is iffy at best and the dim sum is just meh...it's not uncommon to see diners get up out of their chair and walk over to a cart with their dim sum sheet, grab food off the trolley and force the server to sign their bill. Friggin chaos and mayhem.   They either need better staff, or more staff. Something's got to change.   I grew up eating dim sum and as far as the food is concerned, the selection is sparse and slow coming. We were there for about an hour and a half and saw the same thing over and over again. We paid our bill only for a variety to start coming out the kitchen.   The reason for the 3/5 is the hot sauce. I know it's a weird way to rank a restaurant but it's THAT good.   I'd only go back if I was forced."}
{"text":"Decent experience! Visiting from Los Angeles and the food is authentic here but some of the items are lackluster. Great customer service and little wait time on a Wednesday evening.   Really liked the sweet and sour pork, their soup, roast duck, and the veggies were fine.   Some of the plates were dirty, and the lobster was bland."}
{"text":"While the food is average, the restaurant is definitely overpriced. There are several other restaurants that are much better in the area."}
{"text":"Cheap dimsum always attract crowds! If you're not here to get a table at 10:30 am then expect to wait a long time.  For the low price, the quality is great.  Favourite is the seafood fried rice.  I like that they still serve dimsum by pushing carts around. It's more convenient and an authentic dimsum experience.  Come early to get a table, make a reservation for large groups, or come with just one other person to ensure you don't need to wait to be seated for too long."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times weren't the best. It isn't a question of the quality of food which I would say was decent at best. It was more of the customer service.   My family and I had ordered too many orders dimsum and failed to realize that each order came in threes or fours. We had also ordered 3 more entrées in addition. So when the heaps of trays sat down on our table we had called the server and asked to see our order sheet. We had received half of our order and more was to come. She does so grudgingly and I requested to cancel the entrées because there was obviously too much food. She calls another server and tells him something quickly and sharply, then tells us that the rest of the order is already cooked and are on their way.   I expected the rest of the food to come immediately since they said it was on the way. Nope. They came a little over 15 minutes later.   There was a confusion with asking for boxes for the copious amount of dimsum as well. When our table was full, and there was absolutely no room for the entrées, we asked for boxes to put the left overs in. Our server once again started angrily saying things in her language before AND after telling us to \"wait, later.\"  Later, she did give us a stack of boxes to put our leftovers in, but she was hella rude about it. I was also pretty doubtful of whether or not there was spit in our food because of how angry she was...  All in all, it's safe to say I'm never coming back here again."}
{"text":"I rather eat Shit served on a plate than eat their food, the service was just terrible the waders were fighting (in chinese) more then serving"}
{"text":"We love coming here got dimsum and dinners, and they have lots of options for Cantonese style dishes. However, it is often very crowded there and there are lots of line ups. Food is very cheap and tasty but I find it is not as fresh recently. We ordered a fried rice and also noodle but it seemed the ingredients were from the night before and that was why they made it a special. The dimsum is still rolled out in carts which is rare these days so you do get your dimsum experience with that."}
