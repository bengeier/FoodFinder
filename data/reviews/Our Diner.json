{"text":"Though we would try a different place locally and went to Our Diner on Saturday. It was our first and last time. Ordered breakfast started with the coffee cup that had someone else's lipstick on it. Then breakfast home fries boiled potatoes Luke warm with a terrible taste to them. The toast was ok but could have been toasted a little more. Bacon was thick and soft no taste very bland no flavor at all. Husband had French toast which was soggy. When the waitress took our dishes but she put someone else's  dirty dishes on our table to take ours.   Now as I was observing the waitress cleaning off the booth behind us then goes to the kitchen area and grabs the toast for the other table order and puts it on the dishes \"no gloves\". So picture this she just picked up dirty dishes cleaned a table then goes straight to the toaster to pick up food without any gloves for her next order.  Stomach was upset the rest of the day ...food is a zero seating was wherever, cleanliness zero."}
{"text":"We absolutely love our diner!! We go there at least once a month because we love their breakfast options! We have never had a bad experience at this restaurant. I would highly recommend this diner to anyone who enjoys a casual breakfast and lunch experience!!"}
{"text":"Great food, quick service and massive portions.  Every.  Time.  Not sure what everyone else is upset about, seems like someone created multiple accounts to complain."}
{"text":"Been coming here since the beginning, every one is always pleasant and smiling. The food is flavorful  and the portions are amazing never leave hungry ,but always wanting to come back for more. (One pancake goes a long way)The service is top notch always there when you need something and the wait time there is no wait time the food always arrives before you know it. If your looking for a place for your next meal this is it."}
{"text":"Excellent place to get a good home cooked meal that you didn't have to cook!  The pancakes are so huge I can only order 1 and have a hard time finishing it!  Only open for breakfast and lunch but both meals give you a nice variety of foods to choose,  Burgers are great, reuben is good, pancakes are excellent as is the french toast.  The bread is very fresh and the food tastes great.  Highly recommend this place if you are in the Western Suburbs."}
{"text":"I've been coming here with my family for about 2 years and we enjoy it immensely.  The staff is always very friendly and will help you out with any request.  My recommendations are to try the French Toast and Bob's Breakfast sandwich.  
  It's a small little diner, but make sure to bring a big appetite because you will leave with a full stomach!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this diner. When we arrived, I thought it was the cutest little place and couldn't wait to check it out. The service was okay. The coffee was almost flavorless. I asked to change my drink order shortly after receiving it, and was still charged for it on my bill. I ordered the eggs benedict, which took an unusually long time to make, considering we were the only people in the diner. Once it arrived and I took a bite, I could tell something was not right about it. It had an unpleasantness about It that I could not quite put my finger on until several bites later, when I realized the ham was bad. I brought this to my servers attention, who then had the owner come to my table to ask about my concern. Upon hearing that the ham was bad, she immediately defended it, by claiming it to be a higher grade of ham than the usual run of the mill hams that we see in our everyday lives, which, sure.. okay.. I suppose that could be true, but this particular high end ham was clearly past its shelf life and rather than fix the problem, the owner chose, not only to argue about it with me, but she goes on to insult me by telling me I don't know what good ham tastes like. I should have realized something was up when we pulled into the parking lot, just before noon and we were the only patrons there. I have since driven past the place several times and noted that the parking lot was just as empty as every time before. I would never have bothered wasting the time to review this place if it were not for the audacity of the owner to insult a customer for mentioning that the ham was bad. I am almost certain, by the way she spoke of it, that the same ham made its way onto every other plate that day. I don't think I will be returning to this diner again, under any circumstances. Judging by the lack of cars in the parking lot on any given day, i doubt anyone else will be coming back either."}
{"text":"Currently here on a Sunday morning, not too busy so we thought that we lucked out. Turns out it's mostly because how poor the service is. Sat at our table for 10 minutes before I flagged down the waitress to get us some water. Took another 5 minutes to bring 2 waters and slam our silverware onto the table. The decor is awful, it looks like someone hit a double coupon day at Bed Bath & Beyond and purchased all the inspirational quotes about their caffeine addiction. 
It's a good thing our waitress did not give me her name, but maybe she will remember me when her manager reads the staff this review. We were the ones that you were super rude to. Or maybe that's too broad for you. The food was awful, the French Toast was still soggy and the potatoes were tasteless. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Food is pretty good for standard diner fare. Enjoy the Mancini's raisin toast.

Place is always clean"}
{"text":"I went for breakfast today with a friend.
I recommended the place because the people were friendly the last time I was there.
The food was very very good. 

I wish I could say the same about the service.  I was extremely disappointed to say the least. The two women working there had a scowls on their faces when we walked in. 
The server was very unhappy.  
I attempted to break the ice with her a few times. I asked her about herself but she was just short and almost stern with me.  It was not busy when we came in. 
My coffee tasted burnt and strong and I asked for a new cup. She acted mad  . And said,\" I just made it, Literally, we make it fresh one cup at a time.\" 
I felt she treated me poorly just for asking for things. I asked for water. 
Again. I got a remark. \" water? Really?\"
I asked for honey. And had to ask her twice. Her demeanor was pretty bad. 
I still tipped her 25%. Maybe she's just having a bad day. 
But I could feel her unhappiness with her job. I have to wonder what's going on there!! 
I hope she finds a job that she likes soon. 
The two gentlemen in the kitchen worked well together. I had met the cook on a prior visit and he was very friendly. 
And again the food was good. It's hit or miss on the service though. Sorry. I had such high hopes for this local place."}
