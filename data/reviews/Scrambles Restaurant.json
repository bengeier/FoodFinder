{"text":"This was our first time at Scrambles, and it won't be our last. Great breakfast, good coffee and attentive service! Our server, I think her name is Lynette, was very kind and we enjoyed chatting with her.  We went around 2, and I thought we would be rushed or get sort or the \"leftovers\", but the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Food - 5/5 Service - 5/5 Atmosphere - 4/5  We are regulars at this Ajax fixture, Leslie runs a great eatery here, if you're looking for a great breakfast this is the place.  Usually have the VIP platter, and upgrade my pancake to the blueberry, the cook does his job well and is very consistent. Portion sizes are generous, the staff is always attentive even when it's busy but I've never had a bad experience.  Small note, this being an older building the decor isn't the freshest, and the small bathrooms aren't up to my standard, but this is breakfast and it's all about the food here."}
{"text":"Not sure what's happened over the past year, but this place used to be a decent breakfast place. However, over the past year they took their pumpkin pancakes off the menu, which was the best pancake in Ajax. Today I ate my last breakfast there. I got the Scrambles platter, my wife got the farmers sausage. Except for the eggs, all our food was barely warm, as though it had been cooked earlier that morning and just left out. When paying, you could smell the mildewy towels being used to wipe the cook areas down.   Two prior visits, there was a long, blond hair in my wife's food (twice!).  Like I said, this place was a good breakfast place a year or so ago, but it has gone downhill. Go elsewhere, like Sunset Grill, Angelique's, Blue Rooster, or even Symposium. But steer clear of this place until it gets it's act together."}
{"text":"Favourite place for breakfast. Food is always delicious and out quickly. Service is always great. Waitresses are attentive but don't hover. My girlfriend and I come here all the time and always have great food. The cinnamon french toast is amazing and their gluten free bread is the best in town."}
{"text":"Tasty, great portions and reasonably priced. Almost there monthly the last 9 years. Try the platter if you are really hungry. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, just really good food that tastes just like you'd expect it to. Definitely good value for the money. Definitely visit this place during the week as weekend visits are going to be crowded."}
{"text":"Great food, nice portion sizes and friendly staff. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"First and last visit. We came in and got seated. Waited for menu, then waited for order. Wanted soup before lunch _ soup arrived and it was burned. Ordered the omelet and that was good, friend ordered crab Benedict and it came with 2 pieces of asparagus_ very small portion.  Service was very slow for us but if you come often you get served faster. Sorry to say we won't be back $15.00."}
{"text":"Great family spot - my kids love it here! We love to get vanilla milk shakes as a treat after the breakfast special. It is our favourite greasy spoon!"}
{"text":"Good food. Ambience needs uplifting. Competition offers same price food with better ambience."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had, on the road, in Canada.      I found this place on yelp and it did not disappoint. I'm obviously not from Canada, I'm just here visiting, but I felt like I was at home in the Deep South.      I was greeted and picked my own seat immediately, the coffee was mediocre, but hot and plentiful. My food was ordered and prepared fast. The portion was enormous, and for the price you can't beat it!      I had an \"east coast\" I think it was called. I wasn't sure about the baked beans for breakfast at first, but it fit right in. Super thick fried bologna, three eggs, yes 3, beans, home fries, and toast. 6.95$CA... You can't beat it!!!!  A+++++++++++++++++  I'm going back asap."}
{"text":"Nothing like home cooked breakfast after a night shift!!  I went into this Mom n Pop shop with no expectations and came out thoroughly satisfied.  Service was fast & friendly, didn't have to ask for anything.  Breakfast was tasty & in good portions.  Price was right.  Will definately repeat."}
{"text":"This is a serious hole in the wall, situated amongst a bunch of industrial units. Honestly, I wasn't even sure I wanted to dine here, as you really can't tell what the place is like from the outside. One peek in and I was sold as soon as I saw a large family dining here and the fun rooster decorations all over.  The 6oz. steak & egg special was very decently portioned, and the side of home fries hit the spot. I had hoped the French toast with a side of farmer's sausage came with more meat, but to be fair - it was one regular-sized (and quite lean) sausage, instead of multiple teensy, fatty breakfast bangers.   I certainly wouldn't mind fueling up here again before hitting up the waterfront. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Early one Sunday morning, my mother and I were looking for a breakfast spot when I found Scrambles. The reviews were fantastic, so we were in! It's in the corner of a plaza in an unlikely place for a restaurant; just when you think you've missed it, there it is.   It was packed. Completely packed. There was no one waiting when we got there, but there was soon after we were seated. We found a small table in the corner and snagged it. We had just gotten settled when our server told us a bigger table by the window was free. Perfect! Brownie points already and we haven't eaten anything!   It's a small place with a country feel; nothing fancy, but it doesn't need to be. The food speaks for itself. The prices are almost too reasonable. I don't think I've ever said that, but after eating there and having amazing service, you will also agree.   I went with the Signature Pancakes with blueberries and my mom went with the special which is similar to the Spinach Delight but with ham and cheese. These pancakes were made with love. They were fluffy, moist and blue! I've never had pancakes quite like them. My mom's omelette was huge and they didn't hold back on the fried potatoes. It was literally bursting with toppings. The fried potatoes were to die for. If I wasn't so full of delicious pancakes, I would've stolen all of them!   Scrambles feels like home. Food made with love and servers that make you feel comfortable instantly. This is the type of restaurant I love going to.    Going out for breakfast? Go to Scrambles!"}
{"text":"The atomsphere was a little old fashion and its too dim for my taste, as you walk in. The price and portion is decent and fair. The scramble eggs on my plate was too cooked, tasteless and dry. The sandwhich and chicken noodle soup was the meal that did him wrong. After my friend consumed his meal there within the 30 mins drive back to Markham. He felt sick, he was vomitting for the next 3 hours. Something in his sandwich was not cooked probably or not fresh. I dont know is it the chicken or the tomatoes or both, because that was his first meal. Also the service i found there was super rude, they never check up on us. She nevered said your welcome or anything to greet us. Needless to say i think i say Thank you when she brought us water, took our order, place down our food but nothing was coming out of her ... Maybe just a grin. Then when we wanted to get the bill, we left the card there to pay for the longest time. Kinda like she forgot about us, then after she finally brought the machine over. She was holding the card machine and the coffee which she was going to the tables around to refill. Which to me is fine, but can she not try to jungle all the things at once. She was trying to put the card in the machine with one hand, clearly it was going no where.  Like either use both hands, put down the coffee. Or she can just let us do it! Not jus put it in half way and go,  you need to push it down further then walk away. After we finish paying for the meal, we jus let the recepits attach to the machine. Because we jus want out at this point, as we leave are we surprise we got no greetings? Nope! And we still gave tip because we are nice people. Needless to say how can we go back, when the service was rude and unfriendly and also your food made us sick."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and reasonably priced, staff was helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend to anyone! Overall great experience. Left happy and full! :)"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant we had breakfast there this morning and really enjoyed it there. The restaurant deserves a 5 star and it's customer friendly. Workers also have a great attitude and show they want to be there."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast place in Ajax. Excellent service. Very friendly staff. I had the sausage breakfast. It is a farm sausage made specially for the store. Nice garlic and herbs flavour. Love the place we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Food here is spectacular, & the customer service is awesome. It's run by a family from Ajax. Come here if you're looking for an awesome breakfast & good old hometown friendly! Cheers!"}
{"text":"A great, unassuming neighbourhood find!  Don't expect much from the decor -  but the food is fresh, served up with great service and pretty decent coffee.  It surprises me how many restaurants decline altering their dishes to make it a bit more healthy. My lovely server this morning didn't even bat an eyelash and changed up the potatoes and toast for a side serving of veggies instead. They also added an extra egg without having been asked.  If you're in Ajax/Durham area, don't go to Cora's overpriced breakfast factory, come here instead."}
{"text":"The staff are really nice. This looks like a small local breakfast stop And it's fairly small. You come in, seat yourself, and they will come by to greet you! All day breakfast (till they close anyway) and portions are very generous.  There isn't anything really that stands out but it's a nice place to grab a hearty breakfast. I do wish they would serve something fresh with their combos cause it's a bit heavy and too savory."}
{"text":"First visit, will surely return!  Excellent service,  comfortable space, good ambience, reasonable prices. Breakfast was perfect   Not too greasy, eggs and meat cooked to order, real home fries. Top notch family restaurant. Definitely recommend! Yum!"}
{"text":"Very small, so it felt packed, but the food was tasty. I feel for the wait staff because they have to serve, cashier and bust the tables...so when it got busy, service slipped a bit. But we will go back because the food was good. It is very hard to find good breakfast in the Durham area but this is worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Pulled off the road for this based on the reviews.  The staff was very friendly and seating was quickly available.  The food came fairly quickly and was piping hot. We had the fancy vegetable omelet, eggs with peameal bacon, and french toast. The eggs were perfect and my daughter liked her french toast. Would classify this good average but nothing really good or really bad."}
{"text":"Cute little home-style family restaurant.  Food and decor is simple, unassuming, satisfying and tasty.  Service is friendly and quick.  Ambiance is slightly dingy and storefront is uninspired, but in all, a nice hidden gem for a well-priced meal."}
{"text":"Great greasy spoon off the beaten path. Food is delicious, great portion sizes and every time you walk in you feel like your in a small town. Friendly staff!!! My place to go for a great breakfast!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love it! I've been there for a couple of times only but I plan to go there often. This little spot in Ajax is very cozy for a lazy saturday or sunday breakfast. It's a family restaurant and everybody there is very friendly. The food is very good, my favourite the home made fries, just amazing!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, we wanted to give this place a try. We were immediately seated. Hubs ordered Veggie Eggs Benedict and liked it. Daughter ordered 2 eggs over easy with whole wheat toast. She thought it was ok and thought the only thing different was that it came with a side of beans. I had pancakes with bananas and was really disappointed with it. I like my pancakes fluffy but it came out really dense. There was no fluff in it. Coffee was weak. Daughter had the cranberry juice and thought it was sweet and good. Service was nonexistent and didn't feel friendly. Glad I got to try this place but will try other places when I visit the area again."}
{"text":"Large serving size, fast service, great price and good customer service Only prob I had they put sugar in my coffee without asking what if I was diabetic #donttakesugarinmycoffee"}
{"text":"west coast benedict - 2 eggs on a crab patty...AMAZING, fresh made in house hollandaise!  flavorful home fries, love this place and would consider driving here for breakfast from toronto :)"}
{"text":"This is a great little place for a quick breakfast or brunch in Ajax.  The service is great, the prices are fair and the food is very good for a greasy spoon.    They have some surprising options that appear as specials, like whole wheat, apple cinnamon pancakes topped with walnut chutney.  The specials are always well done and are welcome variance to the standard menu."}
{"text":"Best crab cakes eggs Benedict I have ever had. They call it the \"west coast Benedict\" its one of the specials on the wall above the windows."}
{"text":"Overrated. My girlfriend and I came here for the first time and expected a lot better. I had the steak and egg special with mushrooms and onions and she had the V.I.P special, the potatoes where dry and under seasoned , they also had a plasticky taste to them. The pancakes where  flavorless and had a slight burnt taste to them. The eggs , sausage, and steak was good as well as the hot chocolate and bottled lemonade. Overall, it was alright but we would not go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this little place.  Sunday breakfast evey week.  The service is fantastic and the bacon is always cooked perfectly."}
