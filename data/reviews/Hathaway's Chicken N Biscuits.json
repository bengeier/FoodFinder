{"text":"Great service, clean, sides that tasted great and some pretty good chicken. There were plenty of tasty sounding options I did not try to include liver and gizzards, and Banana pudding. 
While we were there, it was. It was obvious that they have a local following. I was just passing through. If I was local, I'd be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Being from a very small North Carolina town, this place is a true old fashioned slice of home. Great food and an even greater staff, friendly and very help. It was my first visit but felt like a regular. Hot wings are by far the best in Monroe."}
{"text":"Had some fried chicken, a few sides, hot wings and wedges to go.  My family wasn't very impressed, though I will say that the hot wings were decent.  Wedges were very disappointing (bought a tub) and all just soggy.  Chicken tasted close to KFC's but less salty and not as flavorful.  The service was just..okay.  The older lady did not seem very pleasant and never once smiled or greeted anyone ahead or after we ordered.  It felt as if being a customer was an inconvenience.  We tried this place out to support small businesses, but in this case, we will prefer to stick to KFC or Bojangles instead."}
{"text":"As far as we are concerned. When it is done right, this is the best fried chicken place on the planet. OMG! So addictive. And the biscuits with the tiny molten pieces of butter spread all through out the dough as it comes to you piping out as if it just got pulled out of the oven. And the potato wedges are very good as well. Love it!"}
{"text":"Hathaway's is a Monroe institution, seeming to have been there forever.  It's basic fried chicken with generous servings of sides.  I prefer this place to any of the chain chicken places, so if I want fried chicken, this is where I go.  The d√©cor (if you can call it that) appears to have changed very little over the years, and that's OK.  The only side item that I do NOT like is the baked beans.  They are flavorless and taste like pork n beans from a can."}
{"text":"Cute locally owned place amidst all the strip mall schlock (chain restaurants). I'm a vegetarian (my boyfriend wanted to eat here) but they do have sides. I got a biscuit, a side of Mac n Cheese and a side mashed potatoes (reminded me of being back home in the Midwest!) The biscuit was so DELICIOUS! However, I personally didn't care for the Mac n cheese (tasted egg-y and was somewhat bland). The potatoes and gravy were fine, if not a bit salty. My boyfriend had \"business men\" fried chicken, a biscuit and fried corn on the cobb and he loved it. I would support this place over the major chains."}
{"text":"I've eaten in the restaurant, and have had take-out on three separate occasions. I'm sorry, because as much as I want to love this place, it just isn't my idea of good fried chicken. Their tater wedges aren't bad, but the rest is pretty unremarkable. :'("}
{"text":"Stopped by on Mothers Day to try the fried chicken, potatoe wedges and mac and cheese. It was good and service was excellent even with the crowd waiting! I will come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in several months. I love this place and was craving it so I stopped for a late lunch. The chicken was way over cooked, and the biscuits were over cooked also. Those are their staple foods, they can't be messed up! The taters were great as always, the service was good as well, however the food just wasn't up to par today. Hopefully this was just an off day because I really like this place."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic but service was terrible.  My family has eaten at Hathaways many times.  We love the food there especially the mac 'n cheese & its very affordable for 6 people.  Tonight I called in an order & was asked how many sauces I wanted.  I didnt know there was an extra charge for more than 1 sauce per dinner.  I said \"4\".  When I  picked up my order I overheard the girl tell the cashier \"extra sauce \" I asked about this & was told just 1/dinner.  I said if I had known that I would not have said 4.  The cashier (turns out she is actually the manager) told me this keeps their cost down but if I wanted she would refund the $.50 I said \"no thats fine but I think whoever answers the phone to take carry -out orders should be more.  The manager proceeded to ring up my order & then she slammed 2 quarters on the counter & said \"next time know it will be extra\" then walked into the back & very loudly tell the employees to make sure they are clear about the extra sauce charge next time.  None of this was necessary.  I said it was fine.  There was no need to be so rude & after being treated like this I doubt our family will return."}
{"text":"Honestly if I'm being honest , this used to be my favorite restaurant in Monroe,but after my Daddy got deathly ill threw up many times after his meal not so much,I reported this to Hathways and they honestly didn't give a shit didn't even have respect to respond ,needless to say my Daddy died shortly after, It's terrible whenever you pay restaurant's your hard earned money and in the end they could honestly care less if you live or die.I was charged like $3.00 for a hard piece of cake,yet again I complained I had to throw it out,and damn near knocked my poor Kitty unconscious  with it! Again no apologies from Hathways  Chicken for the past four time's wayyy overcooked.On a positive note I love the radio station K 104.7!But at the end of the day I'd change the way they treat their paying customers, My entire family have been faithful customers twenty plus year's"}
{"text":"Best chicken around. Plus gizzards and hearts! Everything here is old fashion good! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this little spot when I had a errand that took me to this side of town.  Walking in I was immediately greeted by a energetic lady who was very warm and welcoming.  I ordered some wings just to get a taste of the place along with some sides.  The potato wedges were really good. . .( i normally dont eat wedges like that)..green beans seemed a little too fresh out the can but could have used a little more seasoning (ham hock maybe?) Mac and cheese was just okay.  Now the wings on the other hand were really tasty and crispy. If Im in the mood for fried chicken and Im in Monroe then Ill def. stop by. :)"}
{"text":"I love this little hometown favorite. It serves up quality chicken and biscuits that I love to pick up for lunch time at work. They also have southern dishes that you can't find just anywhere such as livers and gizzards. I love that you can build your own meal if you want because they sell chicken by the piece as well. They have old school arcade games such as mr. PAC man which is also a fun addition. My favorite thing to get here is the tater wedges they are to die for and I haven't met another place that can even compare.  Their staff is also friendly and even during the Sunday rush they find a way to get food out fast and efficiently."}
{"text":"Awesome fried chicken and  cole slaw and Mac and cheese! These guys should be on DDD! Service good and friendly! Better come with empty bellies!"}
{"text":"Real good. It tore me up though in my stomach, was in the bathroom for a couple hours. I needed a good colon cleanse though. 5 stars."}
{"text":"These were the best gizzards I have ever eaten.....how they get them so tender IDK but even my 1 yr old could eat them. The chicken was yummy very crispy and moist. Biscuits were a little salty but were wonderfully fluffy. The sides were just ok the green beans needed serious seasoning and the mac and cheese was bland as well."}
{"text":"Amazing best place ever love it! I wish they had one where I am but they do not which sucks! Every single time I went there the food was amazing. The people were lovely I felt warm and welcomed as soon as I stepped in the door. They will greet you with an amazing smile on all of their faces I do not believe I have ever seen one of them actually not smile they are very down to earth place seems like a small operated business I love her or not unlike kind of a fast food joint but they are like their own place. All in all of you looking for a great place to get some fried chicken I would definitely recommend this place.!"}
{"text":"As the name suggests, Hathaway's Chicken N Biscuits serves up fried chicken, biscuits, and various sides. The food tastes great and the prices are fair, but as a few others have mentioned, the service is unfriendly. As is unfortunately the case with many restaurants in the South, Hathaway's also feels the need to proselytize with Bible verses on their walls.

FOOD
The food tastes very good. Hathaway's does and excellent job seasoning their chicken, battering it with just enough batter, and then frying it to a juicy perfection. The biscuits have a crispy outside and chewy inside- just how I like them. The sides are all fairly standard, but the potato wedges, which I normally dislike, are really stand out. It looks like Hathaway's dunked the potato wedges in batter before frying them. Yum!

PRICES
The prices are overall very fair. Expect to pay $8-$10 for three pieces of chicken and two sides. Nothing more to really say here. One small nit pick is that plastic spoons and forks, as well as napkins are all behind the counter, and when the food is served, you only get two napkins per person. I felt like I was being served in an East German restaurant.

SERVICE
Rude, rude, rude, RUDE. The staff is very cold and unwelcoming. I felt like my presence was not wanted at Hathaway's. I will never understand why restaurants employ people like this. Greet your customers, smile, act like you care. It's not that hard.

Overall, Hathaway's is excellent: their food is on point and the prices are appropriate. But, the place really need to do something about the service."}
{"text":"This place is a big deal in the area. Wasn't up there like Price's (IMO) and wasn't terrible enough to not try again. I would visit again if I was in the area.  Fried chicken, chicken livers, gizzards and potato wedges could all use a bit of seasoning. The texture was there and nothing was too greasy."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been going here over 25 years and the chicken and potato wedges (taters) are the best that I have had. When I get a craving for chicken I have to have Hathaway's. It's worth the drive even now that I live in Indian Trail."}
{"text":"This is some of the best fried chicken in town.  Sides are phenomenal and biscuits are the best.  Doesn't taste like the fast food places and they obviously care about the product.  They have been in business for many years for a good reason."}
{"text":"I stopped by this afternoon to pickup their $16.00 8 piece special with 2 large sides. After waiting in line an inordinately long time, I was helped by a cheerful young lady at the register. I placed my order and paid my check in cash. I grabbed a local paper and sat down to await my take-out order. My name was called fairly quickly, and I was told that they were out of thighs, and that they would substitute wings. I said I would prefer to substitute breasts, and was told that it would be an additional $2.00. I said OK. Then I was told that it would be $2.00 per breast. I looked at their menu on the wall, which priced breasts \"by the piece\" at $2.10 each. In resignation, I handed the girl another $4.00.  After arriving home , I opened the box to find 2 normal sized fried chicken breasts, and 2 scrawny breasts smaller than normal chicken thighs. I called back to Hathaways to speak with the owner or manager, and was told that the owner did not work on Sundays, and that there was no manager on duty either.
  This explains a lot. I am a fairly regular customer, and really like their chicken, tater wedges and the mac n' cheese. I wonder if the extra $4.00 ever found it's way into the register.
  I will go back, but I will not be so agreeable when they change \"the deal\" after I have paid them."}
{"text":"The chicken here is the bomb! Not greasy, super flavorful, and incredibly juicy! Mac n cheese is like going to your mamas or grandmothers and eating on a Sunday! Everything is wonderful here!"}
{"text":"Yum!  We enjoyed the fried chicken family dinner special and the boneless wings. Generous portions and the wedges & slaw were as yummy as described. Boneless were my fav - so tender!!  Prices were very good and we will definitely be back for more!  We over ordered didn't have room for the beans we ordered."}
{"text":"Best chicken and taters in town! Don't let the outside of the building fool you. If you want great food and friendly service, this is the place to go. Get a fried oreo while you're there :)"}
{"text":"If I was grading on just one item it would be 5 stars for the fried chicken, but the mac and cheese and mashed potatoes were not home made.  Disappointed :(  The chicken fried wedges are great!  Friendly staff and food ready fast.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to do a kitchen vacay this weekend so we had to find NEW places to eat for every meal. This was dinner Saturday night. He ordered the 2pc dark meat meal and a homemade chocolate piece of cake (he claims it was his side). I got the 2pc white meat with 2 sides - coleslaw and potato wedges. Man was it good. Chicken was tender and juicy, biscuits were buttery and yummy, and the wedges were tender but super crispy. Tea was \"southern sweet\" and brewed. This is southern style fried chicken....not your Cajun or spicy. Delicious."}
{"text":"I found the chicken and fries to be pretty good, but Hathaway's appears very run-down. It was a little scary since I wasn't sure if their kitchen matched. We ate in, the chicken and fries were good.

I noticed in the Union County Weekly, Nov 23, 2012, they were listed under 'worst scores' given by the Union County Health Dept. The violations included were: hand washing needed between handling raw and ready-to-eat food, eggs need to be separated from ready-to-eat food, food not kept at a safe temperature, & general cleaning needed. 

Hathaway's received a final score of 94.5. Hopefully, they'll be changing some of their practices and better clean to increase that score to ensure safe eating."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. A little greasy, but as it should be. Friendly people and great service."}
{"text":"Loveeeeeeee me some Hathaways! I grew up on this food! Always good and the service is always good! I could never complain.... you won't be disappointed if u came here to eat, trust me!"}
{"text":"So frustrating when restaurants don't double check To-Go orders. Items missing when you get home. Bad enough I paid for the missing items but worse that some of us didn't get our full dinner. Come on!!  Most of your business is To-Gi orders, how can you not have this process fixed by now. It's 2017, there is technology for this. Get it right."}
