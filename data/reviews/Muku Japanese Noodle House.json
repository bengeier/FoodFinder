{"text":"I've been here 3 times over the past few years (never my choice) and each time I leave, I can't say I loved what I had. It tastes and feels like something I could have probably made at home. The last time I came here was only because my favourite ramen place had a wait time of more than an hour and Muku was nearby and empty except for 2 tables of two. 

After the first bite I had of my ramen I almost wanted to just stop eating. The broth was salty, oily, and lacked depth in flavour: to me it tasted something like water with soy sauce and salt. The noodles remind me of something I can pick up from an Asian grocery store and the pork wasn't very tender or flavourful. They weren't very generous with the amount of ingredients in a bowl and the appearance lacked quite a bit from other places I've been to.

After having to make myself finish what I ordered on all 3 occasions and being very disappointed each time, needless to say, I definitely won't be returning again. There are much better options out there people."}
{"text":"I agree with most of these reviews. Muku has the best ramen I've ever had (I found the places I had in Japan too greasy). The texture of the noodles is great and the broth is delicious and not too salty. Price was good too. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Muku Japanese Noodle House just opened recently in the location where Globefish Sushi used to be on 14St NW. Globefish has now moved next door to the building that used to be occupied by a chinese restaurant.  

I went to Muku for the first time yesterday for lunch. This is a great little spot for ramen noodles. Muku specializes in ramen noodles and has a very limited menu of other items. There is no sushi served at Muku, which makes sense as that's why Globefish specializes in. They have about 10 different variations on ramen.  About half of them were soy-sauced based and half were miso based. For the soy-sauce based, they had ton-katsu ramen, spicy ton-katsu ramen, chasu ramen, wonton ramen, and chasu wonton ramen. For the miso based, they offered miso ramen, miso wonton ramen, miso wonton chasu ramen,etc. 

I really enjoyed the ton-katsu ramen (soy-sauce based broth). The noodles were a little chewy as they are supposed to be. I really liked the chewiness of the noodles. The bbq pork was not too fatty. I wasn't crazy about the broth as it was quite rich. But in comparison,  it was quite decent and not greasy. This place is definitely much better than Shikiji's. I'm glad we have more choices now when it comes to ramen noodles ever since Muku opened. I heard the chef was from Hiroshima. This is definitely a nice place for lunch. I'd go back for sure. It's also nice that they have parking as well."}
{"text":"Managed to get to Muku just before a dinner rush. It's tiny, and so it fills up quickly. This was the second time I've ever eaten ramen in a restaurant. I had the tonkatsu ramen, with pork and wonton. The noodles looked and tasted like the ones from a package, and even though I was given a decent amount of pork, I didn't think the dish was a good deal at $13 for the bowl, since there wasnt much else to the meal. The broth had miso in it, and was too salty for my personal taste. The service was quick and efficient, and there is a coziness to the place. Be warned, parking is brutal. My boyfriend found it hard to get his VW Golf out when we left. Unfortunately, it's not a spot you can easily walk to, so maybe biking during better weathered months is your best option."}
{"text":"Muku is a great, low maintenance and reasonably priced way to get Ramen in Calgary. My hubby and I were excited to find an inexpensive Ramen place here. We also love Shikiji but it's a little farther away from us and a bit more expensive. For a quick drop-in dinner, Muku is the way to go. Clean place, friendly service and yummy soup. The miso-based and soy-based chicken soups are lovely. I found the pork based to be a little too rich but that's a personal taste thing. The noodles themselves are chewy and satisfying - the real-world version of the ichiban noodles from my college days. The place is tiny so there may be a wait during prime-times but we've never waited longer then 10 minutes. We've done take-out from there, too and that's a nice option. If you want something other than Ramen, try the sukiyaki beef - it is hearty, slightly sweet and the rice is perfectly sticky. Dinner for two without drinks is just over $30. Not bad for a fresh, hot meal."}
{"text":"I learned to love Raman noodles in Japan and this is one of the only places to get them in the city.  The food is great, service generally pretty quick and prices reasonable (for lunch). Atmosphere is simple and it can get crowded with only a few tables."}
{"text":"First off, this place is crazy busy, so plan accordingly if you'd like to try it.  I decided to get there before it opened, and I'm certainly glad I did, otherwise I might have been waiting in line forever!

Service is great in that the staff are wonderful and very friendly.  However the wait times were unbelievable! My favourite ramen joints back home in Vancouver take no more than ten minutes maximum, so that's the point of reference that I've always had.  I was waiting here for 27 minutes for a plain shoyu ramen, and then my friend's bowl arrived five minutes after.  The whole time we were eating, the line-up at the door had the exact same faces.  I'm sure this place is making some good business since it always seemed lined up, but I think business could get even better for them if they just reduced their turnover time by speeding up how fast they get dishes out of the kitchen.

Sadly I don't think this place is worth the wait--it looks like both people here on Yelp and people that I've spoken to quite like this place, but personally I just didn't like the ramen as I felt it lacked flavour.  My standards for ramen are (I guess) a little high, it has been my favourite dish since I visited Tokyo.  After that trip, I realized just how important the broth is, and it just didn't quite cut it for me here, but it looks like everyone else seems to like it.  3-Stars because it's not bad by any means and the people are nice, but I might have felt very disappointed to eat bland ramen had I waited in that line for over forty minutes like everyone else--phew!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Soup base was extremely fatty but not thick nor rich.  Noodles was in good texture.  Toppings are standard.  The soup base pulled everything down.  Worst ramen I've ever had..."}
{"text":"I happen to be a huge fan of Japanese ramen and let me start off by saying that I've been blown away by some mean bowls all over the world but Muku isn't even close to making my memorable list.

Broth - no complexity in flavor 
Noodle - Do they even make their ramen noodle from scratch? I expect this to be a must for a noodle house. There was absolutely no 'marriage' between the noodle and the broth.
Toppings - Dry, flavorless and boring overall

Honestly, home made ramen can taste much better than Muku's. Sorry."}
{"text":"Muku's has been around for a while and there are good reasons as to why they are still around admist all the new Ramen places opening in Calgary..  However, their quality has deteriorated over the years, that I only go if my friends suggests it - and I used to go there like 2-3 times a month.

Unless you get something crazy or load your ramen with extra toppings, Muku is one of the cheapest place to have a good bowl of ramen.  Their soup used to be much more flavorful, but now it's just standard.  The portion is a good sized, and getting the combo definitely will fill you up.  The noodles are cooked perfectly but they don't add any flavors to the bowl.  Their toppings are good, but the menma is usually too hard, and the pork is small and thin.  

Their yakisoba (more like a yaki-ramen) is actually quite good too."}
{"text":"I developed my love for Ramen when I lived in Vancouver, there´s several places with homemade, yummy soup. It´s like Ramen heaven!

The soup here is mediocre; no depth in the broth and mediocre pork. It feels like amateur made soup - OK, but not much more. And I want my soup to be done my proffesionals and not something I could have done at home.
The boiled egg was good! Fast service and friendly staff, but that goes for every Ramen Place I´ve been to."}
{"text":"I didn't think Muku Japanese Noodle House was that great. It's really nothing out of the ordinary. 

When I went, she messed up my order, but I didn't complain, I just ate what she gave me (she gave me a spicy noodle instead of the non-spicy one I ordered). I was surprised when I took a bite and a sip of soup, there were little flavor in it! 

My pork slices were really stiff too. 

I don't think I'm going to purposely go back for it, but it's a place that you should try out."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of ramen noodles... I think this is a great place to get it. A bit small, but it's cozy and the staff are very friendly...

Will definitely go back..."}
{"text":"I definitely had low expectations when I first came to Muku. A place that specifically sells ramen didn't excite me that much. But, my friend raved about it, so I thought I would give it a chance. I am definitely glad I did! My favorite is the Tonkatsu Ramen. The broth is flavorful, and the portions are very generous. Service is always good, the waitresses have always been very friendly. My only complaint is that I once had the Miso Ramen, and found it to be a bit salty and the corn was slightly mushy. So when I go there, I just stick to the Tonkatsu Ramen!"}
{"text":"Mukku is ramen heaven!  This is fantastic noodle shop serving very authentic ramen from different regions of Japan, including Sapporo style (miso based broth), Tokyo style (soy sauce based broth) and Hakata style (pork bone based broth), and all the traditional toppings such as nori, egg, barbecued pork, bamboo shoots, and corn. I went for the miso ramen (my favorite) and my partner went for the pork broth ramen, and both were delicious.  The barbecue pork that comes with the soup isn't the most traditional, but it was tasty nonetheless.

My partner opted for the deal which for a few extra dollars also added some gyoza, salad, and a bowl of sukiyaki and rice to the meal.  The sukiyaki was especially delicious. Hardcore ramenites might find quibbles with this place, but in my opinion it's a real gem for Calgary. It definitely hits the spot if you're craving some ramen and you won't find anything else this close to the real thing anywhere in the city. Love it, and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Incredible food! I have loved the Miso Ramen from Muku forever, and was thrilled when they started to introduce combination menu items. Their combo offerings are just as delish as the noodle bowls!"}
{"text":"Craving soup after running errands on a rainy weekend, my gf suggested we go for ramen. We arrived before noon so Muku wasn't opened yet so we waited in parking lot (which is quite pot hole ridden - what goes on here?!)

It seemed like everyone else had the same idea for hot soup on a cold day - the lot started to fill up! We didn't want to take our chances so we went to line up by the door. They promptly opened at noon and we were quickly seated.  We each got a lunch box (1/2 order of spicy miso ramen with pork & rice) and sipped on tea as we watched people hustle about outside.

The ramen was great - the spiciness wasn't too overpowering (but had a nice kick to it) and the pork's saltiness complemented well with the rice. 

For around $10/each, you get to enjoy some delicious food and a wonderful lunch. Oh, and the milk candies you get with your bill are super yummy! :)"}
{"text":"Muku gets pretty busy during rush hours. Recommend coming early to line up or get a spot. That being said their ramen are pretty delicious!  I usually get Tonkatsu (pork base soup) or Spicy Tonkatsu (their soicy is not that spicy). The ramens here are reasonably priced, starting at $9.60! If you like fatty pork let the server know, so they can switch your lean pork to fatty or vice versa. Soup is always hot and noodle is cooked perfectly! If you are up for simple ramen recommend Muku!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good ramen place and saw the review and thought I will give it a try. For the quantity and quality, not good. Ordered 2 different types of ramen the miso and the spicy ramen. The tastes like they just used the miso paste from what u would get in the store. Can't even taste any thing but saltiness. The noodle is smooth, but the soup base is disappointing."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best places to eat in the city. Great food, friendly staff, and prices that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Really good food, a bit cramped, and not that long of a wait. I got there around 1:30PM on a Saturday, and was seated in about 20 minutes. Which isn't bad at all, considering it was lunch time and on a Saturday. Where as at Shiki Menya, you would normally wait about an hour or so. 

I had the tonkatsu chashu + sukiyaki rice set, and takoyaki for appetizer. The takoyaki were a bit small, but other than that, excellent food all around. There was quite a lot of ramen, so it was difficult to finish after the appetizer- but I managed.

Beware, if you know you have a small appetite, do not order appetizer, or a set meal. You will most likely not be able to finish it.

10/10 would come here again on any day, given that I have starved myself all day to prepare myself for the meal."}
{"text":"This is great authentic ramen comparable to what I have had in Tokyo.  I wish there were more ramen restaurants in Calgary.  You can customize your order as well which is great.  Add vegetables, eggs, whatever.  

The service is also way above average.  Very polite and friendly service.  I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband & I are regulars at Muku, because it's one of the best ramen places in Calgary that is not only open when you need it to be (why do so many close before 5pm??) and we can almost always get a seat. Service is friendly and fast, and bowls of ramen come out steaming hot and delicious. I always get the Miso ramen because that's my jam, but I have sampled a few of the others when my husband has ordered it and never been disappointed. I feel like I should sample more of the menu to write a more thorough review, but I won't. Sorry. I've been on a quest to find ramen in Calgary that tastes as good as that in Vancouver, and Muku is the only one that comes close so far."}
{"text":"Okay, ever since Cafe de Tokyo closed down years ago off Edmonton Trail (Ken Yoshida). I've been looking for a place to satisfy my Ramen noodle craving. Then my family and I found Shikiji's off center/ and 16th ave. (A little pricier). Then we stumbled upon Muku, it's a small restaurant seating is L shaped around an open kitchen with a few seats around the \"Bar\". They specialize in noodles, so if you're looking for sushi don't come to Muku's. You can go next door to Globefish if you want sushi, they actually unofficially share a parking lot between them. Muku also has a few appy's like takoyaki (they sorta resemble a timbit witha small piece of octopus inside). Takoyaki is actually deepfried with I think a buckwheat flour and then sprinkled with fishflakes and tonkatsu sauce. You can also order the noodles in a combination with a salad. The portions are decent, not huge but you won't walk out feeling that you got ripped off or you didn;t get your moneys worth. I hate it when you leave a restaurant and you fell overstuffed too. At the end of the meal my kids always look forward to getting a sucker. One of the few place that gives kids a sucker, instead of a mint most people leave behind in the bill tray."}
{"text":"First time to try this place coz of the reviews, we went at about 5pm and place is packed with 2 empty tables, us being 5 in total were seated near the door, place is comfy but kinda cold (since we're by the window) anyway, we all ordered Tonkatsu, and it came with 2 slices of chicken breasts, narutomaki, baby corn and green onions atop a bed of noodles, broth is well balanced and homey , worth it for a quick wintry dinner. But I should have ordered extra sides for more meat on my broth ! Ordered the chicken karaage and some fried baby octopus too and yum! Just fried to perfection! We will be back for the other ramen!"}
{"text":"Was a great ramen noodle house. The broth used for the ramen has lots of rich flavour. We also had the Szechuan  beef and rice. The beef was nice and tender. Nice large servings. One recommendation would be to add extra beef or an egg to the soup. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Ate here again with a close friend. I love their options as they're cheap but c'mon... Their meat is a joke...literally! They only give two slices of pork (they're thin too). I do love the broth though I must say. Nevertheless, I was happy to leave satisfied and full."}
{"text":"I went today for mothers day, at around 530 pm. There were not many people so we received our soups in a record time of 4 minutes 55 seconds since the moment we ordered. I ordered the spicy miso, and the basic tonkotsu for my wife. The noodles taste like they are cheaply made, i could even say they are close to instant noodles quality. The tonkotsu, even though i know it is a pork base broth, had a very overpowering pork smell and taste. This is the first time that I could smell the pork even after I finished the ramen and get into my car, and i felt that lingering pork small/flavor many hours after i got home. If you are looking for something cheap, but not the real deal as in Japan, then go to this place. I tried other ramen ( shiki menya, Gagana Ramen, and one other ramen shop in Banff) and this was the worst so far. Only 2 stars for the speedy service."}
{"text":"Go to Muku if you want to get an authentic Japanese ramen.  
I love the cozy homey feeling it gives.  Love their service as well, the waitresses are all very friendly and attentive.  

The ramen and the soup, they are just love in my tummy.  I actually think their menu is lack of selection but I am not going to complain because their ramen are so yummy."}
{"text":"I really loved this place, they offer three main options for Ramen yumminess, and the place is almost always busy I cant wait to go back and get more, oh and the sukiyaki beef is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times & always leave happy. The ramen is delicious & the Japanese staff is always great too!! I usually get the tonkatsu ramen & have also tried the kuroton ramen. The tonkatsu ramen broth is so delicious; full of flavor, garlic, fresh green onion & spices. The noodles are delicious & chewy. The kuroton ramen broth is also very good with a strong garlic & smoky taste.  I also love the ikageso-fried squid legs.

The hiyashi (cold) ramen special is delicious in the summer!"}
{"text":"Authentic Ramen... freshly prepared.  Friendly service.  Cheap to eat here.

The shrimp dumplings are really good!

I go here often for lunch when I'm out, nearby and hungry.

Some people have rated it low/bland but Japanese food isn't really known for strong flavours... it's a subtle cuisine.  Expectations are well...

Parking is a problem at this place.  Not much space and Globe Fish overflows into their lot."}
{"text":"Along 14st sits Muku, a small staircase will lead you up to a tiny narrow restaurant with limited seatings and limited bowls. Squished to the brim with as much tables as they could have possibly fit, with some bar stools along the counter to look into the kitchen where the magic happens. Shiki is hands down my favorite spot in Calgary for Ramen, but for authenticity- Muku seems to be riding on that line. 

Tonkotsu - ($9.60) - 
Tonkotsu Chasu Wonton - ($13.60) - 

As the bowls arrived you can see that it had a top layer of fat that was already starting to become a film, good sign that it's full of pork fat which means A TON of flavor. Which you can honestly taste, it's full bodied and not overly salty. The noodles had a bouncy snap to each bite which is ideally what you'd want in your ramen bowl. Chasu pieces were generous and they were ridiculously tender as well. Bae had the bowl with wontons in it, he quite enjoyed how big and filling the pieces of wontons were! Only complaint would be that the bowls don't come with soft boiled eggs. Aside from that, the prices are so worth the amount of food that comes with it, bowls were delicious and service was fast and friendly. I'd recommend coming here, but get here either before prime rush or take your luck for after, the front entrance is quite tiny and awkward to be waiting around for a seat!"}
{"text":"If you never been to Japan, well this noodle house definitely gives you a taste of what a freshly made ramen noodle soup will taste like.

It is Japanese owned, and the staff is very friendly. This was my second time coming here, I had the soy-sauce based ramen this time. On my first time I had the miso based ramen. Only thing I wasn't to crazy about was the pork, it felt a bit dry.

I am a New Yorker, and I felt it tasted better than the high end ramen houses in New York City. Everyone should eat here, no matter where your from!"}
{"text":"Super high expectations given the reviews. Japanese owned place so I was impatiently anticipating the food. The soup was ok, but no egg!! And the pork, while more generous in portion than the place down the street, was super dry and sliced thick. Disappointed..."}
{"text":"great little ramen place. the kuroton is rich, smokey heaven. it's a small place, but has a cozy atmosphere. they don't split bills though, so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"Muku is well worth driving across the city for. Heck even if a massive earthquake rips through Calgary and the tectonic plates shifted, sending Muku half a world away, I would still make the drive there. But then that theoretically put Japan next door, so....(EDIT Mar 21/11: Yikes! Inappropriate?:S how could have I known?)

Anyways Muku's Ramen menu is divided into several groups. You can select your broth base as either the Tonkatsu, Shoyu, or Miso. From there you get several Ramen fixings such as bamboo shoots, nori, and BBQ pork slices. There are also several fixings you can request for a small additive charge. I often request the boiled egg which I think was marinated in soy sauce. Every bowl of ramen contains, well, the ramen noodle of course. Once in a while they do have random specials, I remember having a refreshing soba noodle dish during the summer and my recent visit had an interesting concoction that they called \"Ninja Ramen\". I feel that every visit Muku is a different but comforting experience. I never stay with one specific ramen style and always change things up. Every time I am never disappointed and always satisfied. The broth is always robust and drives the character of the dish. And the fixings always make every slurp, chew, and gulp indefinably wonderful. I feel like a kid in a large playground full of swings, ladders, and planks. However, when I sometimes eat here with my mom, she finds the broth a little salty, so with a kind request, Muku will make the adjustments necessary for her to enjoy her bowl or Ramen.

I wish there were more noodle house places in Calgary like Muku. There used to be Sobaten on 11 Ave but that came to pass a long time ago. While there are restaurants in Calgary that have Ramen in their menu, I prefer to go to a place that is more focused on a specific style of dish, i.e. noodle house, you can tell by Muku's open kitchen that they are dedicated to serving you a great bowl of Ramen"}
{"text":"Muku has awesome ramen and is definitely worth the wait when it's a chilly day in Calgary (so everyday from Oct-June)

They have miso, shoyu and tonkatsu ramen, all come in spicy and other additions if you wish. I usually get miso which I'm always happy with. Noodles are cooked well. The broth is never too greasy, and the pork is tasty with the perfect fat to meat ratio. If I remember correctly, their ramen doesn't come with an egg, we added it extra but I need egg with my ramen!!

We usually get our ramen in a combo with the side salad and small rice bowl with this tasty beef. It's quite a bit of food for me, but the boys usually finish it up being super full. 

It's pretty tiny in there so expect to wait a while for a table."}
{"text":"To skip my nostalgia, proceed to the ***

Until Muku, they only experience I'd had with ramen was the college experience. You know, the one where you and the roommates roll into the Superstore parking lot in 1988 Mazda and a cloud of smoke (from the car, of course). You pool your pennies together (remember pennies?) and if you're lucky, you have enough for the giant bold yellow box of No Name ramen noodles. Hooray, nourishment for a month! There were two ways I knew how to cook these noodles - you could put them in a pot of water, get distracted with Mario Kart and come back to a mushy mess, or you could open the package and gnaw on the brick of them. To me, that was ramen. While I look back fondly on this experience, I'm also very happy to say that Muku Japanese Noodle House shattered it!

***Before you even get into the restaurant you will pass two signs exclaiming NO SUSHI! Judging by the signs, It seems like maybe a person or two has come in asking if they carry sushi.  I don't know if they do or not. I didn't ask.

Get ready to be cozy with your neighbours and possibly wait in a line. I was there at 6:30 on a very cold Thursday and there was no line, but it was right full. They've got a waiting list at the front as I'm sure on any other less arctic day, you'll have a wait.

The servers were so friendly and very quick. I went for the Kanban - the Miso Ramen their menu says they're famous for, but with fatty pork (their words) and cabbage on top.

The servers were quick. The food? not so much. After ordering it took about half an hour for the soup to arrive. It didn't seem like I was forgotten about as other people were waiting about this long. I guess that's just how long noodles take here. Be prepared to not be quickly in and out.

As you may have gathered from the opening ramble, I'm no ramen expert. But I did get a tasty, hot and filling meal that had me diving in full face-plant., slurping, and  being an embarrassing mess. They had classic rock radio turned up and as it turns out, Eric Clapton makes for some top notch ramen munchin' music. I loved every second of it.

Once your done with your eye opening ramen experience you can hone your driving skills trying to leave their tight parking lot. How did I get in there??

Muku is quirky, adorable and cool. I can't wait to bring people here!"}
{"text":"From the first visit, Muku became one of my favorite places in Calgary. I've sampled a number of noodle dishes on their menu, and am decidedly hooked on their Kanban Ramen--the spicy pork is delightfuly flavourful and just spicy enough to give the dish some zing without being overwhelming. The broth is rich and the noodles are always cooked to perfection. I work neaby, so it's a constant struggle to not give in to my noodle cravings.
The atmosphere is pleasant and the staff are always welcoming. This is the perfect spot to visit before, or after, a hot yoga session at nearby Bodhi Tree. And when faced with a cool/drizzly spring/autumn/winter day, nothing says comfort like a steaming bowl of ramen. Conveniently located on 14th street near trendy Kensington, Muku offers free customer parking and a quiant, closed-off patio that I'm excited to frequent during the summer months. Their menu is delicous and very reasonably priced. Muku is my go-to dining spot for a quick, tasty meal, or for the occassional date night. Love, love, love."}
{"text":"Japanese run Ramen place, very busy, small dinning area, pretty good environment, ramen pork bone broth is very rich, sorry, just a bit too rich for me, LOL, quite authentic."}
{"text":"On several occasions I have gone to Muku with friends only to find that they are sold out of an item. Usually rice or the soup,  but have also encountered a shortage of beef. I personally find it unacceptable that an establishment could run out of items on such a regular basis. They will also close up to 2 hours early when they run out of something,  so make sure you call ahead,  or you may end up being incredibly disappointed. 

Ramen itself is OK,  service can be slow at times. If they were able to remedy their stock issues,  it would be a more enjoyable place to eat."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my boyfriend today. It's usually really busy here but we got a table right away. It's a small place and the tables are very close to each other. The ramen was good. The meso broth was yummy and the side rice with BBQ pork was delicious. Service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd taste of Japanese Ramen. I've been to 2 other places and it's decent. It's a crowded place and tables are packed fairly close together. The advantage of going solo is that it is usually easy to get a seat at the counter. Service is good and at the end of the meal you can one of those fabulous gummy candies! There is parking and depending on the weather and how people park there is usually sufficient parking."}
{"text":"A great Introduction to the world of Ramen. Played it safe and order the Kanban. 
What a bowl of flavourful goodness. It's was not over salted which was a pleasant surprise. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and their ramen have always been excellent!  The broth is very flavorful and the ramen is the right(slightly chewy, not soggy) consistency.  The servers are very friendly, efficient, and helpful(especially if you are having trouble deciding what to order).  This time we tried one of their appies, deep-fried baby octopus($6.95).   Hmmmm... I felt that they could've given us a more generous portion(see photo) and some pieces of the octopus weren't cooked through.  Next time, I'll order the calamari legs...
      My hubby's favorite is the miso ramen and mine is the Hakata style chasu and pork wonton ramen."}
{"text":"I think Muku is the best place for ramen in Calgary. It is consistently good and I have been there at least 10 times. I think the prices are fair for what you are getting, approximately $12. My favourite is the Tonkatsu ramen! I am usually much too full to finish the entire bowl, but my boyfriend can always finish his and my leftovers too. 

I've also tried some of the appetizers there like the gyoza and chicken karage but I have to say that the takoyaki is the best. One of my favourite places to get takoyaki!

The staff is always friendly, and I love the candy they give you with the bill! So yummy. They also sell the candy in zip lock bags there, but the staff did not hesitate to tell us where they bought it from (Arirang, the Korean grocery store downtown) when we asked. So kind. 

It's nice that they have a parking lot, but it feels a little bit cramped. Also, you have to be careful when you turn into the parking lot and/or when you are leaving because I think you could easily hit your bumper if you are going too fast. 

Overall, I think Muku is a great place to eat if you are craving some good ramen. It is very affordable - our bill for two for two ramens, two teas and sometimes an appetizer - is usually between $25-30."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for ramen! It's simple, it's flavorful and it's filling! They have a nice decor, the staff are friendly, polite and speak in Japanese to each other! I like sitting on a stool at the bar so that I can watch the chefs make the ramen. Having never been to Japan I'd have to say this is as good as it gets in Calgary! I highly recommend the ramen with pork broth (there are different broths). They've changed the menu slightly over the past three years multiple times, which says to me that they care about their business and are willing to improve long after they had first opened their doors! I love Muku!"}
{"text":"after travelling around japan a couple of years back, im a ramen snob. i tried the tonkotsu ramen, the shrimp dumplings and the unagi bowl w salad here. my ramen was blend compared to all the previous ramens ive tried (in japan & in toronto) and the dumplings were heated in the microwave :( unagi bowl was below average. perhaps this was heated in the microwave as well? i dunno, i didnt see for this one.

however, my bf - japanese ramen virgin and a picky eater, loved his ramen. he drank every last bit of his broth. he wasnt too keen on the dumplings either tho. he didnt try the unagi but said the salad was the bomb! lol.

we sat at the bar table by the kitchen. i love the open kitchen concept where you can see the cooks make your meal :)"}
{"text":"I have been hearing so much about ramen over the last little while that I decided to jump on the bandwagon this week with a visit to Muku.

We went at 11:30 because I had read that it fills up at peak times. We were only the second table in there but within about 15 minutes the place was packed so that was a good choice.

We decided to share takoyaki to start because I have been seeing pictures of them and thought that they looked delicious. However, I totally forgot an important thing.... I don't like octopus. I am not particularly picky and usually like most things but on a high school exchange trip to Kyoto I tried it.... And really didn't like it. My bad for ordering it and I am sure that if one does enjoy octopus they would be delicious. 

I ordered the wonton tonkatsu ramen with extra pork belly and egg and my friend had the kanban also with pork belly and egg. Since I have never had ramen before I don't have anything to compare it to but I can honestly say that it was delicious. The broth was good, especially after I added some togorashi. The noodles were great! I love how they were kind of firm when I bit into them. My friend said hers was also good but she would have preferred it to be spicier. I would likely agree because I love spice! 

It was a really good lunch, close to downtown a and I was back to work on time. A win in my books."}
{"text":"As a new resident of Calgary, It's my goal to find all the best bowls of noodle soups.

Popped in here for a quick Tonkatsu Chashu Ramen.  
Broth was rich and tasty, ramen noodles with proper consistency and pork (chashu) fatty and delicious.

Very happy to find decent ramen in Calgary as Edmonton is severely lacking. 
Service was very friendly and quick. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Just off 14th St next to Globefish (worth noting as there are plenty of no sushi signs in Muku). Parking located on the side of the building, Muku is on the east side of 14th and the street is busy so plan your approach accordingly. Relatively small inside with lots of two and four top table options, I came in looking for ramen so I didn't spend to much time on the rest of the menu. I ordered the Spicy Tonkatsu, it wasn't very spicy just enough to add some extra flavour not burn your mouth or anything. Very reasonably priced at $9.60, the pork was tender and flavourful with the right amount of fat (I prefer less fatty pieces). Overall it's a good warm meal on a cold day."}
{"text":"We've been to this little noodle house a couple of times. For ramen, it's a great choice. They have the option of three types of ramen, plus additional options for each type, as well as other choices on the menu depending on what you're craving. The food is always good, the service is decent. Parking can be a bit of a pain as the lot is tiny but all in all we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Lucked out and immediately found parking and a table! Ordered the Tonkosatu charsu wonton bowl, and a Tonkosatu wonton with extras (pork belly, egg).  Wontons definitely not worth it but the broth, noodles, egg and pork belly were good.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"If you like noodle soups, this is definitely a place to try, especially when it's cold and miserable outside. Turning left into the parking lot from southbound on 14th St NW can feel like dodgeball if you're caught in rush hour, but it's worth it. No sushi, K? A big sign on the door makes sure you understand that Globefish is literally next door. But guess what? You can order deep fried baby octopus here. Yum."}
{"text":"I ordered the Tonkatsu with Char Siu and extra noodles (as usual). While the noodles were great (al dente) just like any other ramen places, I felt that the broth lacked flavour and was too salty. The char siu was thinly cut and had much more meat than fat, which I like. They also give you lots of it too. But I didn't notice any flavour or seasoning in it, which is unfortunate.

I'd come back here to try other ramen and broth. I would've given a 2.5 stars if I could but out of the ramen places I've been to in Calgary thus far, I prefer Menyatai's broth and Shiki Menya's charbroiled char siu more."}
{"text":"I've been slowly working my way through all of the ramen spots in Calgary and Muku Japanese Ramen was next on the hit list. It's owned by the same people that run Globefish, which is conveniently located beside each other. The parking lot is tight but woah, Muku is buuuuuuuusy. We got there around 5:30pm on a Friday evening and there already was a crowd of people lined up.

There's two lists to put your name down on - one for tables and one to sit at the ramen bar. Choose wisely, then breath in the aromatics (don't worry, the wait is bearable). Their system would be infinitely better if they were grouping people based on table size. Seriously, I know first come first serve is usually the way to go but when you put two people on a four spot, that's a waste of real estate, especially considering their capacity. Oh well.

The menu is purely ramen (the way it should be) and you can choose from three broths - tonkatsu, miso and shoyu. Each broth has a choice of regular, spicy and then add ons (extra meat, wontons, etc.).

- 2x Tonkatsu chashu wonton ($12.95) + set ($3.00) - my buddy and I ordered the same tonkatsu chashu wonton ramen - for an extra $2.00, you get five extra slices of chashu pork and two wontons. Muku's tonkatsu broth had depth and was very flavourful. Both friends and I agreed that we could easily slurp up a bowl on it's own, after all, this is their speciality broth. Made from pork bones and a soy-based sauce, you'll want to dive right in. Bathe in it even. The ramen came topped with fresh green onions, young corn and a slice of naruto (Japanese fish cake). The noodles had a nice chewy bite to it and stayed that way till the bitter end. I have to say, I enjoyed Muku's tonkatsu much more than Menyatai's but Menyatai wins hands down with their chashu. Both have their strengths but are winners in my book.

We also added the $3.00 set menu which gives you your choice of a small rice bowl (beef, chashu and unagi) and salad. I went with the unagi, which came with two pieces of tender, fatty eel pieces. One more would have been perfect. The salad was light and refreshing with a sweet salad dressing on top. It's definitely worth adding onto your meal.

- Miso ramen ($9.95) - my friend went with the miso, which is made of chicken and fish broth and Muku's original miso paste. I sampled a bit of the miso broth and I definitely was a bigger fan of the tonkatsu. It really depends on what you want though. The miso ramen came with chashu, fresh green onions, corn kernels, bean sporuts, bamboo shoots, carrots and nori.

I'm still baffled by how many good spots there are in Calgary to get your ramen fix in. Seriously, soooooo good. Ramen done right. Sit at the ramen bar and watch the one ramen maestro/chef work his magic. It's unreal, it's literally one man doing everything in the kitchen."}
{"text":"If I could give Muku 2.5 stars I would. The service was great but the food was only okay. The menu is very limited for non-pork eaters (be warned). It didn't seem worth the price, despite the friendly service. Also a note that they won't split the bill which was annoying at the end of a not-great meal."}
{"text":"I went with a few of my classmates from Japanese class, based on recommendations from friends.

It's a small and quaint noodle house. Very clean. 

Our group ordered the Miso Ramen, Spicy Miso Ramen, Miso Butter Ramen and Shoyu Ramen. We didn't have to wait very long for our orders. The serving size was a generous size for the price. The broth wasn't too salty (nice!). Absolutely delicious.

There was even room for green tea ice cream afterwards. Again, generous helpings.

Perhaps if we weren't busy chatting, we would have noticed the Japanese books and magazines on the shelf that we could have (tried to) read for Japanese study.

My only beef is that Muku doesn't split the bill. At least, there is some signage on the bill tray. However, it would be good to include that in the menu or on a sign so that patrons know ahead of time (hence the 4/5 star rating).

The milk chocolate candies that came with our bill are also sold separately. They are yummy enough to buy a bag."}
{"text":"I have gone to muku several times now and absolutely love their spicy tonkatsu chashu ramen. I order mine half size with bean sprouts. You definitely have to try their sukiyaki beef -sweet and flavorful. Another fave of mine is the unagi rice, generous amount of unagi although I feel like the quantity has decreased from the very first time I tried it. I have not tried any other ramen houses but haven't felt the need to. Hole in the wall with good service. Only downside is that it is sometimes super cold inside, especially beside the window."}
{"text":"Always like to go MUKU for ramen. Especially when the weather is getting colder. Reasonable price. Order ramen with bowl of rice only ask for no more than 20 bucks. Food is super tasty. Not too salty flavor for ramen with properly garlic inside super yummy( usually I don't take any food garlic related.)"}
{"text":"Yelp keeps telling me they love the tip and just the tip isn't enough. So here is more. There's a big sign at the door that clearly indicates no sushi. Ok Muku we got it. 
Parking sucks since it's a sharp turn into a small lot with limited spaces, but if you go on off hours it's decent. Ramen portions are really big, and you can get a meal with a small tiny salad and a small rice as well. The tonkatsu ramen broth is hearty and milky. Add butter and it's orgasmic. The noodles are consistently chewier than I would like but that's a personal preference. In the winters, the windows don't keep the cold out so bring a sweater. Overall a local and personal favorite. Hits the spot and a quick in and out to get your ramen fix."}
{"text":"I got the original ramen and it was delicious! Only $9.50 for a bowl that comes with 2 piece of pork."}
{"text":"Easily the best Ramen in the city! 

Great portions.
Simple, perfect, ramen!

Broth in the home-made traditional soups is great, but the home-made unique \"specialty\" soups are AWESOME!
With Ramen - it's all about the broth. The noodles and the toppings are one thing, but the broth is really what distinguishes one restaurant from another.

They have a great \"set menu\" option where you can add a mini salad and a small rice bowl for a few extra dollars. ONLY DO THIS IF YOU ARE HUNGRY! Seriously, the bowls of ramen are huge. It's awesome that they have extra nori, ajitsuke tamago, veggies etc on the side that you can order as add ons in your bowl.

My wife and I always go here for ramen. We've tried other places, but this is the best we've had since coming back from Osaka over 5 years ago!"}
{"text":"I came here with my sister, since she really want us to try this ramen place. I have been to many ramen place in NY and I have to say this place is not that bad at all. I remember my hubby and my sister both order the ramen, which they both enjoy very much. They also have a salad which I've tried and it taste pretty good. A friendly reminder, this place can get really busy so if you want food and a place to seat, come early."}
{"text":"Now, I may not know what authentic ramen taste like, as I have yet to travel to japan. My last trip to Vancouver had opened my world to ramen and I'm hooked.  

Since my trip back to Calgary, I've been looking for something compatible. Now Muku may pale in comparison to the many epic offerings in Vancouver, it is still my favourite go to ramen shop.

Their service can be slow, and depending who the cook is on staff for the night, you may run into some inconsistencies. 

Yet, despite all that, I still find myself craving this place. I have mixed feelings every time I come here, and yet I leave satisfied every time. 

I've been eating here since they opened, and I think I'll dine here as long as I could."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped by to eat here Saturday afternoon and we were anticipating a wait, but when we got there, only a few groups were ahead of us on the list. When you sign up, you have the option to ask for the table or the bar - and we were ok with both. Fortunately a big group left and they were able to make three tables so we got in right away. We both decided quickly to order the Tonkatsu ramen, but decided to add extra pork wontons and an egg to each bowl. 
The food came out quickly and was very hot. The noodles were al-dente, the broth was delicious and the pork was amazing. If I came back I think I would skip the wontons and add extra Char Siu. The portions were big but we both wanted desert, so we decided to get the green tea ice cream for after. I didn't care too much for the ice cream but my friend enjoyed it. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to come to Muku, hoping for authentic ramen. They offer three types of broths (miso-based chicken, soy-based chicken, and soy-based pork. I went for the chashu ramen, which came with six slices of barbecued pork and one slice of pork belly. I had 3 others with me and none of them ordered ramen (amusing in the very least). I had a bit of everything at the table and it was all decent but nothing in particular stood out.

The noodles were decent but unspectacular and the broth was really quite thin and not very complex. When I have ramen, the broth is the key. The broth and noodles should complement each other but the broth needs to have more complexity than what I received . I still enjoyed my meal at Muku, but as a ramen house, I expected more."}
{"text":"Tried it last week for the first time, and can't wait to try more of the menu.  Ample parking and easy to find.  No wait time for 1, sat up at the bar and had a Miso Ramen.  Delicious silky broth, plenty of lean AND fatty pork slices and the noodles had perfect texture.  I love watching the kitchen; lots of good looking dishes made right before my eyes.  It's a small restaurant that was nearly full and decor is nothing to write home about....but I came for the Ramen, and Muku delivered the goods!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! A memorable experience in a unique little place, topped off by great food. It was the dead of winter when we came here; we had to  trudge through a block of residential snow, and cross the precarious 14th Ave to find a place that looked like a converted elementary school portable, complete with the business-room chairs and plastic-top tables, and a deli counter. We took a table and perused the menu to find the perfect bowl of ramen. When it arrived, it was exactly what was needed to warm our hearts and souls: the broth was a delight, and the veggies were perfectly done. As we sat in the warm little portable, looking at the howling wind outside and contrasting it with the gently rising steam from our soups, it formed a picture of paradise."}
{"text":"Fabulous every time! I've tried all different dishes on the menu and all are great!"}
{"text":"Weather turned chilly after sunny hike this morning and knew exactly where to go for some delicious and healthy bowl of Tonkatsu Chasu ramen. I requested the extra Tamago (egg), nori and fried onions on top. Hot green tea was served immediately while waiting for awesomeness soup to be prepped and perfected. Place was predictably packed, but everyone was polite and the ramen was top notch. Worth the wait -- and bring your cash and manners, please"}
{"text":"I mean, the ramen is good here and the service is okay. But, it's nothing more than that. It's simply mediocre. Not bad but certainly not the best."}
{"text":"I went with the tonkatsu ramen and shrimp dumpling appetizer.  I've decided I'm not a fan of ramen.  I'm sure this is very good as far as ramen is concerned, but I did not like it at all.

The dumplings were okay."}
{"text":"I had a spicy miso ramen. It wasn't spicy at all. But in general it was a good ramen. However, one complain about the size of side unagi bowl. They gave me only tiny two piece of unagi on top of the rice."}
{"text":"having lived in LA for many years and stayed in Japan a few times, i missed having accessibility to authentic japanese ramen.  The noodles didn't appear to have been made from scratch and I found the soup broth lacking, which is the most important part to any soup noodle.   Not that it was \"terrible\" mind you, it was ok but not to the point where it justified the higher price which Muku charges.  

To anyone who has watched the amazing classic Japanese film  (Tampopo), you know you have a good bowl of ramen noodles if you finish the bowl entirely: ramen noodles along with evert drop of the soup.  Needless to say, I didn't finish my bowl entirely."}
{"text":"Loooooooooved the food selection, the service, the price and the ambiance. I wanted to hug all the staff."}
{"text":"I found out that I can order half orders of the ramen noodle soup!  Sometimes, I just feel like a lighter meal and the idea that I can order half order of my favourite ramen noodle soup makes me happy!  :o)

Thanks, Muku!!"}
{"text":"Ramen noodles have good texture, chewy and tender all at the same time.  Good flavor broth, simplistic flavors but still tasty.  Ordered the ninja ramen with miso based broth."}
{"text":"Been there just once, with a friend who highly recommended the place, and the visit was very satisfactory.

Despite being incredibly crowded during the lunch time (well, that's actually a good sign), order for three was served very quickly, and our soups were delicious. Huge portion, very well made.

Place itself is tiny and beaten, but not filthy - and it should be way more quiet and comfy outside of the rush hour.

Would definitely like to be back!"}
{"text":"Cute little ramen place right next to Globo Sushi.  Their prices are great and I loved their ramen broth.  Service was fine.  We also tried their octopus balls as an appetizer, they were pretty interesting, soft texture with a sweetness.  Overall, we enjoyed having a warm up lunch here.  Great for a ramen fix"}
