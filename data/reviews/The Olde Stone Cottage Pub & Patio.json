{"text":"Great place to come for a pint! And the food is good too! Nice little fire place in the dining area and pool tables in the back. Sadly this place gets packed! If your going on a Friday or Saturday night, make sure to get there early. They may want to consider putting more staff on during busy nights, cause with only standing room often times, waiting for a simple bottle of beer at the bar is too much. Great place, but needs more staff to handle the volume."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, good beer selection and the kitchen is good pub food (if a bit salty). Good staff and a big patio; if you're in the 'hood, I recommend it but don't drive, parking is limited."}
{"text":"This is the perfect weekend evening spot, both on hot summers and on freezing winter days . The Leafer burger is a must try. Great quality food and good drinks make this a definite go-to spot in Scarborough. It's also a historical building!"}
{"text":"Went in around 4:30 to grab an early dinner. wanted to sit on the patio, had to go in and get our menus.  waited 10 minutes for the waitress.  She never came around to take our order so we left.  Customer service was non-existent."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Definitely one of the best burgers I've had in Toronto, and I've eaten a lot of burgers in this city. Fries were also very good too, the mark of a great pub I think. My friend (who's a regular here) loves the wings. The service was very good; friendly and attentive. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and good food.  Had the steak sandwich with the side salad which was good.  My friend had Mac and cheese which looked delicious."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are amazing. Beef sourced from a local butcher. Definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Good local. Some good food options, nice atmosphere and servers. Like the fireplaces and the servers are pleasant."}
{"text":"The good first: Their outdoor patio, although noisy from the street traffic on Kingston, is nice. We went on a nice evening in August and there were no bugs, and it wasn't too busy. And now the bad: their food was atrocious. I'm pretty forgiving on most food, but our wings were simply unedible. I tried the red pepper dry rub and my dinner companion commented they were \"like the turkey on Christmas Vacation\". So dry, they almost went *poof*. Fries were mediocre.   Definitely will never return."}
{"text":"I'm not sure when my irrational fear of Scarborough pubs started, but it definitely hindered my exploration of the Olde Stone for several years. Once inside I quickly realized it was definitely not the nightmare my overactive imagination was thinking of...

The staff were incredibly welcoming and the variety of food (jerk chicken dish, bacon mac and cheese, curry dish...what?!) was inclusive of different tastes. Service was excellent. The price was just right, you could easily get several drinks in and some food without breaking bank. The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming.

The crowd is a bit interesting. The night my friends and I walked in (around 7:30) Olde Stone was mostly an older crowd, after an hour or so several crews of young baggy attire wearing guys came along (this is not to say they were rude by any means, it was just an interesting visual). The neighborhood drunk singing and applauding the tunes of a (pretty catchy) band definitely added to the conversation.

All in all, I actually enjoyed this place. I didn't leave Olde Stone poor, angry, sick, or wanting to take an immediate shower. Most importantly, I wouldn't mind coming again."}
{"text":"Been here several times and loved it. Amazing food, great service, with a price that can't be beat.  It has become a regular spot for myself and my family to visit on a weekly basis.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Service is so slow. I ordered a fish and chips and it's taken over 25 minutes to prepare and it's 6:30pm on a Wednesday. Music is too loud which makes conversation hard, and the waitstaff weren't attentive.

With that said the food was really good, crispy and well battered."}
{"text":"New to town, this is a place that stood out when driving to and from work. In the midst of plazas and car lots, stands a beautiful, stone cottage. I couldn't resist! 

They have a large parking lot and patio. On the outside and inside, there are plaques giving you the history of the place. Both floors boast a large fireplace. The loft is also available to be rented for private parties. This place is bigger than you think! 

Being a huge fan of Fish Tacos, that was my pick. My dad was feeling spicy and went with the Curry Chicken. Our server said those were 2 of the most popular dishes on the menu. Perfect!

I've had good and bad fish tacos in my day and I was excited to see how these would stack up. Barely held together with toothpicks, the lightly battered haddock was drizzled with salsa. I've had my face melted by fish tacos before and was a little worried. The salsa had a sweet spice to them that really let the flavours of the haddock come through. 

My dad made quick work of the Curry Chicken. The coconut milk mellowed out the curry just enough that you knew it was there. It was an ample about of veggies and chicken and lots of sauce for the accompanying basmati. Both of these had the perfect portions, enough to fill you up and clean your plate! 

Service was great. My dad is chatty and none of the wait staff ran away. They were all knowledgeable about the food and the cottage, which was nice.  

Glad I live close, so I can go back again!"}
{"text":"Dragon boat lettuce wraps - I've wanted to try these for some time, they were okay, wouldn't order them again. 

Shepherd's pie - another new dish for me. The meat component was good but the cheese had no. Flavor. Improved by mixing with ketchup. 

Wings - ordered Guinness and Roasted Red Pepper. Dining partner said that the RRP ones didn't have much flavor but what little they had was good (I couldn't taste anything but salt). Love the Guinness ones! (They're super saucy. 

Atmosphere is nice. Large, well spaced patio. Food came out quick - all servers take your orders on a tablet which probably sends it back to the kitchen in real time which also ensures order accuracy. 

Service left much to be desired. None of the patio severs has any personality, didn't smile, didn't make small talk (I've served for years, that's all part of the job...) 
We were on the road with our two dogs and asked before coming in if we could bring them onto the patio and got permission which is great but could have done without all the servers looking at the dogs like they were mangy street dogs (I'm a dog trainer by trade, they're extremely well behaved...) 
Didn't bring wet naps with the wings, didn't refill water, really small annoying things that are basic service. 

Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"I love any place that has Stiegl on tap, and it's only $6.50 which is a nice change from $9 pints at most other chain bars.  It's an independent bar, with a nice patio and true to its name cottage like feel inside.  The burger here is really excellent, great beefy taste and the wings are tops a swell.  The vibe is usually pretty good, but on occasion you will run into boisterous douchey \"tough guys\" from the Guild!  It's not uncommon to see a fight here on the weekend, for this reason I can't give it 5 stars, I can't stand people who can't handle their alcohol and this place tends to have too many of them.  That being said, its a great date place, and if you don't engage in too much conversation with the local drunks you shouldn't have any issues."}
{"text":"Ordered Fish 'n' Chips. Good service, clean dining area.
Very classic feel inside.

Little pricey for the location but no complains.

Can't really comment about their food as I didn't try any REAL dishes!

Updated review to follow soon...."}
{"text":"Their nachos are so awesome! The staff are so friendly and the environment is busy and lively. Went on a Friday night and there was a live band that started playing around 9pm! Great time!"}
{"text":"Few friends and I strolled in on a Saturday night and enjoyed the laid back ambiance on the patio. There was a live singer and guitarist outside. The drinks and food were great with fast service. Inside there were pool tables and lots of people just relaxing. Definitely a great neighbourhood bar."}
{"text":"Impeccable, friendly, service. Great food from a solid chef in the kitchen. Friendly, approachable owner. I highly recommend the Olde Stone Cottage when you next need a place to kick-back with a beer and some food.... Lots of screens too so's not to miss your sport of choice."}
{"text":"Came here for my work holiday party on a Thursday night.

On Kingston Road, it's a little out of the way unless you live in the Scarborough Bluffs. There's a large parking lot on site; by the time I arrived, the lot was full so I risked getting a dent and parked my car in the middle of the lot. That being said, many of my colleagues mentioned that there's a lot of street parking within walking distance. The venue is nice and clean; the place looks like an actual cottage. There are two levels; our group occupied the second floor. Food was okay - we had a number of platters. The nachos were a little disappointing as it didn't have much cheese on it. Drink menu is not too large. Service was excellent - I have to give kudos to the staff. 

To me, this place is an average bar in the middle of nowhere so I don't think I'll be back, but if you're in the area and wanting a drink, why not?"}
{"text":"We came here for a Friday night and it was popping! It got full fast around 7PM. We stayed from 6PM to 10:30PM.

We had two appetizers of the veggy spring rolls and the veggy samosas. I really loved the mini samosas as they were extremely tasty! The spring rolls were alright, nothing crazy but it was not bad at all. I had the fish and chips and they were great! Only con is that the chips were a bit soggy and I would have prefered crispier chips.

They have a good selection of beers since this is a pub, and fairly priced, so drink your night away!

Recommended!

Con: Low volume of parking. Plan your parking beforehand or try to find some residential parking around."}
{"text":"Nice building with ok food. The nachos were ok.  Good size portion however the salsa was disappointing. Tasted more like a tomato sauce with an overpowering coriander taste.  Waiting staff seemed a little rude at times."}
{"text":"Well it's been Years since I've been here !!
I was in the area visiting a friend so why not stop in and check this place out again right !?!?! 
So here I am , I ordered a burger with cheese ,fries on the side and a beer ! 
As did my buddy , another burger and beer .
Server was prompt as the place was dead .
Food pricing is very reasonable and tastes pretty decent . 
My only complaint was after we finished our burger and beer we were rushed out ! 
Our waitress came up and said just the bill boys ? And put the bill down before I can open my mouth and say ,No I'll have another ! 
I don't think that's ever happened to me before .
Maybe she can smell the West end lifestyle in me now and they don't like that in Scarborough lol 
Ether way rushing out patrons is not the best thing to do ...oh well ,it is what it is ! 
If I'm in the area again visiting my buddy we will definitely go somewhere we can enjoy our drinks in peace !"}
{"text":"Service was great even when the place was packed.  

Great special menu for St. Patricks Day. Very festive. 

Great band and entertainment. 

Thankfully we got there early and found parking !"}
{"text":"Came here this afternoon with my dad and a couple of close family friends. Surprisingly, despite coming to the church across the road weekly for choir rehearsals for 10+ years, I never noticed this quaint cottage housing a pub.

Fairly good crowd present considering it was a weekday afternoon; however, the layout prevented the noise from one room disrupting the quiet environment in the adjacent one. Tables are spread around the dining area.

Menu consists of mainly pub fare but covers all your pub favourites. I had the Bacon Mac n Cheese, as it has one city-level awards. The flavour was that which you seek when craving for comfort food. Lots of cheese between the cheesy cream sauce and the extra sprinkled on top before they bake it. The bread was small but tasty. Everything that the other diners had looked equally delectable.

For dessert, they only have two offerings: a white-chocolate Brownie pie and one which I didn't pay attention to because I was already in love with the brownie pie. That pie was not too sweet but chalked full of fudge, brownie pieces, sitting within a smooth white chocolate pie. Would highly recommend it!

If you're looking for a cute little pub outside of the city centre this would be a good option."}
{"text":"Came here a bunch more recently for lunch & dinner (separate days), as well as a while back with family when I was back in town for a few days. I haven't been here before that, so let me preface my review with the fact that I may not fully know what I'm talking about, but I'd like to comment at least on my current experiences with this establishment, as they've all been super positive.

The beer selection was quite reasonable; I selected Steam Whistle once, Rickard's White another, and Keith's on my least recent visit (you can tell I'm an ale kind of person!). The sweet potato fries & spicy mayo here are great - not too soggy, but also not so greasy that it feels unhealthy!

I've had a few things; most recently, the steaks, but in the past I've had ribs, burgers, and sandwiches (chicken club!!), and all of them have been in the \"great to extraordinary\" range in terms of portion size, price-to-fullness ratio as well as speed of service (the food always comes out fairly quickly, even when the place is extremely busy - within 10-15 minutes!). 

I have a (anaphylactic) peanut allergy, so sometimes desserts are a troublesome thing for me, especially at restaurants that serve them, BUT NOT HERE. Twice I've had the cake, and it's been amazing - not only in terms of the taste, but also in terms of just the quality of presentation and how great the price was (mind you, it's more than reasonable!).

It has the feel of a local pub / restaurant while maintaining a great variety of food choices and quality. Don't try their \"Asian\" dishes (curry chicken, from what I've heard, has been pretty terrible, but let's be honest, this isn't an Asian restaurant).

Pros:
- well priced dishes
- good variety of food
- meats are always well cooked and exactly to order
- presentation of food makes me feel like a filthy casual diner
- beer selection is on par or better than other pubs
- doesn't feel like a pub
- hey look they have TVs
- oh look they have a dessert selection too!

Cons:
- anything other than (what I consider to be) \"white food\" is apparently of lesser quality (pad thai, curry chicken, etc)
- menu selection, while having a variety, only has limited options for soup/salad (not a salad/soup bar, though!).
- side selections are limited, but still there
- sweet potato fries substitution is $2?!?!?!? :'(
- pints are a little overpriced, but that may be because of the variety in initial selection

Overall, would recommend. Seems like a hole in the wall, but gets quite busy around meal hours, and for good reason!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to express our sincere thanks to everyone at the Olde Stone Cottage Pub. We had a bridal shower on April 26th for 40 guests in the VIP room upstairs and everything was perfect. The food was great and the space upstairs excellent. Thank you to the wonderful Olivia! She was the best! She was attentive, very helpful and super friendly!!! Loved it and will definitely recommend this restaurant to all our friends and family."}
{"text":"I recently visited this place late one Sat night and the experience was alright but nothing to write home about. 

I will start by saying the building itself is charming, it is very warm and welcoming in general and the patio is spacious with a very down to earth, cottage porch feel. Inside had two major rooms from what I can tell, one had live music and a large bar while the other smaller room had more seating, pool tables and background music. The place seemed to be large enough to accomodate large parties and also seemed like a good place to hold events but for a bar it wasn't my favorite option. I found the service a little lacking, it took a while to even see a menu little own recieve our order. My guest and I did not dine but we decided to grab a pitcher and some appetizers, so we wound up getting calamari and chicken quesadilla's both of which were nothing special to be honest but not horrible either.

The crowd at that time seemed to be an interesting mix of adults and what seemed like just legal teenagers so I was a little perplexed. The baffling argument with what has to be the nicest security/bouncer I have ever seen was entertaining as it began rather livid but seemed to fizzle out and end in smiles and handshakes. I will admit happy endings are always a better time for everyone so I was glad the argument didn't escalate to something dangerous as it sometimes can down in Toronto especially.

They had minimal parking directly out front so my guest and I had to park across the street in another lot, however I am not entirely sure that was the smartest move but my guest, who lives nearby assured  me it was ok.

Although it wasn't a horrible experience I will say it wasn't anything memorable and I will likely venture elsewhere next time I'm looking to grab a few pints."}
{"text":"Great place and nice staff...I am having my wifes birthday party in their party room and they have been so helpful and nice. 

I would recommend this place to anyone!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I love the exterior/interior, it's an actual cottage! Food was great, there was a show on the night that I went, wasn't so loud as to interfere with conversation. Our waitress was a little \"not on the ball\" but seeing as it was a Friday night, can't really blame her. Went with a few people, we tried the wings and poutine. Everything was de-lish. I like that it has different sections, with the bar section adn the more \"restaurant style\" seating as well. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Hard to find something on the menu that interest me!  Went with the chicken wings that had lots of taste and an amazing amount of sauce!  Not my favorite but passed. I also had a Ceaser salad which could have been tossed a couple more times to distribute the dressing evenly.  Drinks were cold and service was passable!  The music was a solo act playing mostly from the '80. Would go back for drinks and entertainment!"}
{"text":"I found the Olde Stone Cottage on a blog about the Top 10 pubs in Scarborough, so I decided to check it out.  Parking is limited - luckily I managed to find a spot at the far end of the parking lot. 

We had no issues being seated and were seated promptly.  The atmosphere was cozy. They had a live musician as well, but i had to yell to be heard by my companions. However, I don't think that this is atypical as other pubs have the same. 

I ordered the bacon mac and cheese as this is supposed to be one of their popular dishes. I didn't have to wait long before it was brought over to our table. It was quite tasty - hot, gooey with cheese sauce and yummy bacon. 

Overall, it was a good experience. But I don't believe it was far above the other pubs in Scarborough that I've been to. If I'm in the area, sure, I'd check it out again. But I wouldn't purposely make the trek out here as there are other decent pubs closer to home."}
{"text":"Finally got to try the crab cake with a non-veg friend! They were delicious. However the beef and mushroom pie was once again salty, which I'm starting to see is their status quo. I'm going to go back for the beer, mixed drinks and appetizers and maybe even the generous salads. But definitely not the entrees or desserts."}
{"text":"Went here last Friday to celebrate my friend's birthday and thought that it was really good! 

People who worked there were really polite and sweet, and were very accommodating. The interior of the restaurant was also very cozy-looking, and they also had a live band playing which was neat.

The food was also really good - We all had different things, some were hits and some were misses, but I personally enjoyed the Jerk Chicken and Rice platter.

The only downside was how dimly lit the exterior is. But otherwise may come back."}
{"text":"Classic style pub, one of the oldest buildings in Toronto as well, a classic. The service is on time and tables are cleaner than most pubs. The food is good, especially their chicken wraps, vegetable soup and mad and cheese.

Their fries are terrible, brown and soggy. I recommend getting the soup or salad instead of the fries but other than that I got no complaints."}
{"text":"Huge Patio+Live Music+Friendly Wait Staffs+ Decent Food!! All winning elements for a wonderful summer evening! 

And surprising this place is in Scarborough!! 

The Olde Stone Cottage Pub shares their parking lot with a used car junkyard with broken sign....looks a little sketchy from the outside. I usually don't want to walk into a pub in Scarborough all by myself as I just don't feel comfortable hang out alone there. A look at the patio and their patrons at The Olde Stone, I decided to tough it out! 

Patio..with padded cushions... I just wanted a drink and some snacks. Ended up my Sweet Potato Fries ($5.99) really filled me up... I ended up just have that and skipped dinner. Somersby Apple Cider ($6) a little on the sweet side but really refreshing for a summer evening. 

A quick pre dinner drink ended up last the whole evening as my Hot Yoga Date decided to join me.... 

Sipping Apple Cider, hanging with friend and listening to guitar player singing oldies............................ Chill!"}
{"text":"Had my 21st birthday here on a Friday night, and not only did I love it, but so did my cousins and friends! I rented the top floor of the pub and it was so much fun!! We had a personal bar w/ a bartender + the space was more than enough. 

Staff were extremely kind and patient. Bartender was nice and quick with the orders. Whenever someone ordered food, it came up as soon as it was done. I personally tried their crispy chicken tenders which were good! The portion was pretty big. At one time, a glass slipped and fell.. yes it broke. However, someone who worked there but downstairs came up and cleaned it. They told us not to worry. Def. will consider having more get togethers here!

Only con (which didn't affect us that much, except when people I invited kept calling), would be the parking space is so limited! Esp. on a Friday night, it got so busy!! Parking was so hard to find."}
{"text":"This is a great local place and a nice hangout spot. I'm pretty sure they must be watering down the drinks as I had plenty to drink including shots with no affect. Live music is usually excellent, and I typically am very particular about music and not easily impressed. Fish tacos are a favourite but can be quite messy."}
{"text":"The Pub itself is such a cute building! Literally its an old cottage made of stone walls, walk up the grey plywood deck into a warm and bustling Pub on a Friday night. Dim lighting, with the sounds of Rob Creamer belting out some live tunes and tearing it up on the piano keeps the atmosphere lively.

A server greets us on the way in and tells us to grab a seat wherever we like and someone will be over shortly with menus. The restaurant is sort of split into 3 small sections, the bar side, the lounge side with pool table, and dining room area with fireplace. Plus there's a lovely garden patio outback for the warmer nights.

We pick a table in the dining room side at the very back of the restaurant complete with candle light and dark wood tables.
The menu is simple consisting of typical Pub fare plus a menu of weekly specials. There is no drinks menu but our waitress advises us that on that there are 16 varieties of draught, domestic, imports, craft brew and even cider on tap.

For starters we go with
Vegetarian Flat Bread- Topped with mixed peppers, spinach,sautéed onions, mushrooms, black olives, feta and shredded cheese.
We order the half portion size and are happy we did as we are astonished to see 4 large pieces arrive on a platter. The crust is very thin but not crispy enough to hold up against the ample fresh toppings. Knife and fork are required but it's still delicious.

Mains
Pulled Pork on a Bun + Sweet Potato Fries- Select pork shoulder rubbed, seasoned and slow-cooked to tender perfection topped with sautéed onions on a fresh Panini roll.
I adored every bite of this sandwich! The meat was tender and very flavourful, not overly sauced so the meat was able to stand on its own and its great flavour definitely stood out! Loved the addition of the sweet caramelized onions and fluffy toasted fresh roll which was able to hold up the ample amount of meat.
Sweet potato fries came as a huge side, cooked perfectly crisp with a delicious garlic aioli. 

Dessert
A great selection of desserts but as a peanut butter lover one particular item definitely won me over.
Peanut Butter Cup - A chocolate cookie crunch cup filled with peanut butter nougat, moist chocolate cake, and a scrumptious mousse full of chunks of Reese's pieces.
I was so lucky that I was able to snag the last slice of the pie that night! If you are a peanut butter fanatic like myself this is a Must Try! So creamy, peanut buttery, chocolately everything I require in a dessert plus it's topped with reese pieces and drizzled with more chocolate.

I was in a definite  food coma at the end of this meal! Overall great ambiance, great food, great service, and great prices as well. This is a definite must if your in the east end!
FYI Coffee here is surprisingly really good, came out piping hot with great flavour. Downside is that parking is really limited as it is shared with a used car lot, so either come early or try your luck at the nearby neighborhood streets."}
