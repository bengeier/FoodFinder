{"text":"One of my favorite take out Asian food places! Food is delicious, small little mom and pop shop, and they're always kind as can be."}
{"text":"This is a great destination so definitely make a trip to Yamas. Owners are great and the sushi is very reasonably priced. Some rolls are 20% less than what I see at other Sushi Bars."}
{"text":"Thank you for a wonderful Christmas Eve dinner.  Kung Pao chicken was good - although it's the first time I've had it with Peas.  But the best part our dinner was the Orange beef they made for me.  It's not on the menu but it was sooooooo good.  They definitely will be my go to spot for Chinese food."}
{"text":"When we do order for Delivery - - it's always Pei Wok.  Mostly fresh, and very quick delivery.  The last few times we've ordered it *very* spicy and they either add the hot chili sauce as a side or they spice it up fairly well.  Very reliable and yummy for delivery!"}
{"text":"When owners/staff changed we kept hoping for the best.  (The friendly owners/cooks of the previous restaurant were top notch, hence the good reviews).  But now, alas. . . Lemon chicken that turned out to be pork (and bad at that), wontons in soup that fall apart, greasy greasy lo mein and eggrolls, it's just not worth it.  Prefer to give locals the business, but this is truly awful, even after many hopeful tries.  Panda Express it is until someone else does a better job."}
{"text":"This is very much a cary-out/delivery business - don't plan on eating here.  It's right next to a nail salon, and smells mildly of finger nail chemicals.  It's small, and slightly shady, but the people were friendly enough.

I went with my 'safe' standby for Chinese food: General Tso's Chicken, which was pretty decent, but nothing to rave about.  My girlfriend had their Orange Tofu, which was also tasty, but not special.

This place is convenient, so we'll order from here again, but don't expect to be 'wow'ed."}
{"text":"These are old reviews! I don't review much because when I do it's a place worth my time reviewing lol awesome food here! Great prices too! Orange chicken is some of the best I've had! And I know orange chicken! Like that their food doesn't mess my stomach up and sit heavy like others. The soup is a nice big portion as are all their entrees, tried other places in the area and they don't add up to the food quality and prices here! This is a pick up or delivery place for sure which in my opinion is how most of this food is :) perfect for me"}
{"text":"Food was great! I had the orange chicken lunch combo and it was super affordable and tasty."}
{"text":"This is still one of our favorite Chinese food places. We will drive out 20 minutes to pick up an order! Even the hubby will say, when in the Ahwatukee area, so, we are near Pei Wok... lol. Their dumplings are great, house fried rice, lemon chicken, etc. We have tried several dishes with them. Always delicious! Talking about it... now I want some!"}
{"text":"Wow,this place is outstandingly good! I am so glad to have found it. It is really good food.Great price,I will be returning to eat again very soon in the near future."}
{"text":"Tried this local place last night, super happy I found them. Thanks to Yelp I trusted and you came thru. Moved here a year ago and I am excited to know that close to home I can pick up take out. I wouldn't suggest indoor dining but that's really ok with me. All meals tasted fantastic and no belly ache after. Great service and we will be back. Excited to tell my neighbors all about this place. Yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good and seems fresh.  Lunch prices are great.  Dinner is a little on the pricey side for what you get, but it's still worth it.  Nothing is really spicy.  We've had most of what is listed as being spicy on the menu and it's really pretty mild.  If you're in need of something with a lot of spice, it may be worth asking to have the food made to be extra spicy or just try somewhere else.  The orange chicken is probably my favorite.  It's way better than what you get from somewhere like Panda Express.  There isn't really much seating inside, so you pretty much want to just plan on it being take-out."}
{"text":"Great place, BBQ pork appetizers and crab puffs to die for, lo mein is great, love the Moo goo gai pan, house noodle soup and salty shrimp, can never get enough!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!  Everything is always good.  Tried beef with broccoli and it was very tasty. Hubby got veggie Lo Mein. Very good too. Egg rolls are awesome as well.  Fast service too."}
{"text":"We LOVE Pei Wok.  

The Spicy Fried Rice (extra spicy please) is an awesome side dish.  

The Guys love the Lo-Mein but I favor Egg Foo Yong (big fluffy and nice gravy) or the Curry which is some of the best I have had at a chinese joint.

The Hot & Sour Soup is A++ full of yummy stuff - very well put together - I would put it up against any sit-down restaurant in town and they would win!

These are nice people - they deliver on time, order is always right and the Fortunes are always positive!"}
{"text":"We have ordered here a few times its pretty good its a small \"mom and pop shop\" but that is what you want with chinese food!  The spicy fried rice is pretty good I was expecting a bit more spice, but hey it was still different and yummy"}
{"text":"There is not many take out places in tukee, but this one is the best priced and best food around here. And the do deliveries! My favorite items are house chow main and sweet and sour chicken, I most definitely would recommend this to friends !"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new spot for Chinese food and I had seen all the reviews on yelp were good so I had to give it a try... We arrived to a really small area off seating about 20 people could fit in the whole place... I think the best bet is ordering take out seeing how everything is served in to go boxes... The staff was really friendly... My lunch crew ordered the Mongolian Beef, Orange Chicken and Lemon Chicken. I rate the food as followed.

Mongolian Beef - C+
Orange Chicken - D
Lemon Chicken - D
Fried Rice -D
Egg Roll - C+

I had high hopes for this spot after seeing the great reviews... The Lemon Chicken was like fried chicken bits in a clear lemon sauce that tasted like sprite. The Orange Chicken was chewy chicken with no flavor. The Mongolian Beef was just ok it... After such a lackluster meal I will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We just moved to 'Tukee, and I drove home realizing I had a hankering for some Chinese food. (Hankering? Apparently having experienced Cracker Barrel one time now I am a Southerner who says things like hankering and \"fixin' to\"). I don't know the ins and outs of the neighborhood entirely yet, so I came home and got on Yelp and figured I'd give this place a try. I called and was told it would be about 45 minutes to an hour wait for delivery - totally fine, I'm not dying or anything. By the end of my order the guy said, \"More like half an hour probably.\" Even better! So it ended up being an hour and ten minutes. Maybe I'm to blame for this since I didn't know our apartment building number (you'd think they probably are pretty good at navigating apartments though, our building is right near by and I am sure they deliver here frequently). I also feel bad because the driver called me because our complex has a gate, I forgot it closes at six, and we have yet to set up the phone number/directory thing to let people in. Whoops. So far I am sounding like a pretty horrible person...I promise, I'm not out to torture the delivery drivers of the world!

I ordered Mongolian chicken (okay, and an order of crab puffs, AND wontons...I had to meet the delivery minimum, which wasn't posted on their website, but I figured my boyfriend can eat the leftovers when he gets home. ...Or whatever, I'll be a fat kid tonight and go to town alone), and substituted the white rice for fried rice ($1 extra, why not?). The chicken was good - good flavor, and definitely a big portion. Not what I've usually had as Mongolian, but good nonetheless. The fried rice...I don't really see what was \"fried\" about it in the typical sense - it was pretty much white rice in oil, as another person already said in their review. The crab puffs...I'll be honest, I'm easy to please in the crab puff category. They were sweet, and very yummy, and had a good texture (you know bad crab puff texture when you have 'em!). Egg roll was standard, greasy but good, and the wontons were HUGE and really good. (Don't be afraid...I sampled everything but left a good share behind for the good ol' BF.)

Overall, I wasn't incredibly impressed. Wasn't bad, wasn't fantastic...cured my Chinese craving, but just barely. Will continue to try and find a really good place nearby..."}
{"text":"This place is just around the corner from where we live and we're on the hunt for a favorite neighborhood Chinese food place so this was first on the list. My boyfriend went to pick up the food and let me just say...it was ridiculously fast. I don't think he could have gotten McDonald's drive-thru that quickly! Not that promptness it a bad thing, but it did make me questions the whole \"made fresh to order\" scenario. We ordered Sesame Chicken that came with white rice and then General Tso's that we substituted fried rice. For $2, it was just rice that was swirled in a pan with some oil I think, there was no vegetables, no real flavor and negligible amounts of egg, so not really worth the substitution. The chicken was good, a little dry, but good flavor. They do serve nice recognizable pieces of chicken, as opposed to the super heavily battered, fatty, greasy, could be stray cat for all you know pieces of chicken. The chicken was lean and the sauces were not oily at all, as Chinese food goes.  The General Tso's was not very spicy at all unless you got a piece of one of the peppers, but still had that General Tso's flavor. The sesame chicken had that nice nutty rich flavor to it. Overall it was pretty good. I had originally selected 3 stars based on pure food quality, but based on speed, price and their lunch specials are super reasonably priced, can't wait to try those, I bumped it up to 4 stars. Mr. Chao's Asia Bistro and Great Wok are the next contenders on the list, so we'll see who comes out a winner!"}
{"text":"Family run. Great variety, all freshly cooked on premises, real homemade style with fantastic flavor. Their crab puffs are to die for, the best I've had anywhere. They cook fast, the food tastes great, and if you need it, they deliver too, it can't get better than that, eat there all the time."}
{"text":"New owners and staff....... too bad...... 
The food is close, but not as good as with the previous staff. 
The egg rolls are mediocre and when you ask to substitute a crab puff, they tell you only at dinner not at lunch...... Which does not make sense as they charge 99 cents for an egg roll, but crab puffs are 6 for $3.75 or about 65 cents each. I hate wasting food and since the main course is just OK, this makes it tough not to drive down the road to Fast Food Chinese!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was so bad. The meat quality was horrible and hardly edible. There are much better Chinese food places to try."}
{"text":"I had to give this an update because it has been so long and I am still a loyal customer! 

I believe this place changed ownership in the last couple years, but the quality remains. 

While I have tried the other Chinese food in Ahwatukee, I have not found any that I like as much as Pei Wok.  All the other places leave me feeling like a grease bomb exploded in my stomach after eating. 
I even feel gross after eating others' vegetarian dishes!  

At Pei Wok, I typically stick to broccoli beef, chicken fried rice and orange chicken for my family.  However, I have tried nearly everything on the menu that is beef, chicken or veggie. 

The Mongolian beef has a bit too many onions for us. 

The other dishes are excellent for Chinese takeout. 

Also, they offer fast delivery service in Ahwatukee and... Bonus... they are a shorter drive away than any of the other places from my house.

I plan to skip cooking tonight because it's Takeout Thursday.  Pei Wok to the rescue!"}
