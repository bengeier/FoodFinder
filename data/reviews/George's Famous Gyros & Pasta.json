{"text":"Very good! Staff is friendly and the food is wonderful! We have gotten the gyro sandwich and the chicken alfredo and my kids are hooked."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick meal, really was empty except for one person when we arrived for lunch.  It was clean, well lit, and had friendly staff.  Portions were large and prices average.  One of our gyros had some relatively dry meat in it.  Fries were good, not as seasoned as I like them, but good."}
{"text":"Three words: Bang for Buck. You can't get better food for less money, I dare you to try. But after you try George's at least once for good measure, of course."}
{"text":"First visit - nicely impressed.

Original gyro was great, stuffed with meat and pita was very soft. I do wish there as a few more onions and a bit more sauce, but overall very good. Fries with crispy and cooked well.

Meatball sub outstanding with a good flavor to the meat. Again, a bit more sauce would have been preferred.

We'll be back and try more of the extensive options. Super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"we really enjoy the food here. not many good Greek places to eat with such a good variety of food"}
{"text":"A great lunch spot. A simple, unpretentious, clean and well presented place, a little off the beaten path but not hard to find. Had the gyro salad and the original gyro with fries. Large and tasty portions, friendly and helpful staff. For what more can one ask, for a quick and inexpensive lunch?"}
{"text":"We moved from Virginia to AZ and haven't had any Mediterranean food in about a year and a half. Saw this restaurant on Yelp and figured why not. Wouldn't change it for anything! We ordered falafel which was delicious, and the hummus tastes really fresh. The gyro meat was absolutely spectacular. Will definitely order from this place again in the future!!"}
{"text":"I went today for lunch first time here. I took gyro supreme with chicken and veggie and asked to make it spicy with side of fries. It was so delicious and I am definitely going there again."}
{"text":"closest thing to an actual gyro in Greece I can find in the valley! even better than some I had visiting greece. portions are ample, spices are authentic, and the Greek dressing is fantastic. I always get the original gyro with salad and side of dolmades......and I always have leftovers. go here!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Thank you Yelp! I've lived in the neighborhood for almost 4 years and had never tried George's until yesterday. The location makes it a bit tough to recognize from the road. The original gyro was fantastic! Has to be the most meat I've ever had in a gyro, and great flavor too! So I took the to-go menu with me and saw something intersting, George's Chicken Faliro. Had it for lunch today :), sliced chicken breast, artichoke hearts and capers, sauteed in olive oil, butter and a little lemon, topped with a bit of feta, all over pasta, outstanding!!! Great value, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We flew from Texas to eat here. It's that good! The real deal with personal, friendly service! Best Mediterranean food I've had to date and I'm always on the lookout. Y'ALL should all put this place on your stopping list."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of gyros and this place has great gyros. Clean establishment and very personable service.  Every time i visit, the owner is personally checking up and thanking each guest.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is not much to write home about, but the food was pretty good.  Three of us had the chicken breast gyro sandwich with salad, and one had the meatball sub.  Everything was delicious.  All in all, a very satisfying lunch that was freshly prepared.  Beats the chain restaurants that were our other option as we drove through north Phoenix.  Keep in mind that this is only one step above a fast food place.  Go elsewhere if you want nice plates or fancy service.  If you're feeling adventurous, then by all means stop in!"}
{"text":"Love their greek salads here. I've tried a lot of their menu items and have never been disappointed. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Best gyro and baklava I have tasted. The owner and staff are very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, restaurant was clean, and busy. We had a special order which they got right. Food came in no time. Gyro was huge, enough for 2 people to share. Price was fair but you didn't get a drink with your combo. Would definitely go back and I recommend to all my friends. Very satisfied!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Value for money. Pretty effective loyalty program. Better than most of self proclaimed best Gyros in North Ph"}
{"text":"George's is a gem and has quickly become my go-to place for pasta and Greek salads. The people are friendly, the atmosphere copy and the food is delicious. I love the alfredo with grilled chicken. So good!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is small and serves on paper plates with plastic silverware.  Limited selection of Greek food.  Great gyros.  Friendly staff.  I would recommend take out or if you are fine with a no frills place."}
{"text":"BEST Chicken Caesar Pitas ever!! Chicken grilled to perfection. Pitas grilled perfectly. Crisp romaine lettuce. Topped with melty Parmesan Cheese and the best dang Caesar dressing I've ever tasted. Delicious. So glad we found this place. Great customer service. Owner and staff are very friendly. And like usual... I can't tell you how anything else taste, because the Chicken Caesar Pita is just sooooooo good - I've never tried anything else  ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Very generous portions at an affordable price. Staff makes you feel like family. Couldn't be happier with the food and service!"}
{"text":"Yelp reviews did not let me down. This place was amazing. The hummus was great and the original gyro was incredibly delicious. Portions are huge! Service excellent."}
{"text":"Came here by myself for lunch and ordered the platter and when they found out it was just for me they let me know it was a large meal for 2. I appreciate this kind of honesty and will definitely be back.  Oh and the food was great"}
{"text":"I've been going to George's Famous Gyros for over a year now.  I have never been disappointed with anything I've ordered.  Normally I order the Original Gyro with a Greek salad and George has the best Greek salad dressing I've ever tasted.  The vinegar makes the dressing tangy but with a splash of sweet.  The salad is packed with fresh veggies including cucumbers, red and green peppers, onions, tomatoes and topped with plenty of feta and Greek olives.  
The gyro meat is sliced thin and well seasoned.  It's complimented by a refreshing tzatziki sauce. 

George and his father are always courteous and friendly.  Oh and don't forget to sign up to Belly.  The Belly card tracks your purchases so every once in awhile your meal is free.  Great incentive to keep going back."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and it was very good. My friend had a gyro and fries and I had the Greek spaghetti.  Both came with either a salad or fries and were very tasty and reasonably priced. My daughter had the chicken nuggets and though they were the dinosaur shaped chicken from Costco they were exactly what a three-year-old would want.  My only complaint would be the volume of the TV going in the corner, but I can overlook it for the tasty food."}
{"text":"Ok this wasn't the first time I have been to George's but every time is as good as the first time. I had the half pound burger which I swear is the best I have had at a restaurant. It comes with a salad or fries. I had the fries which are good also. The burger stands out because of the bun and spices they use. I have also had the gyro there before and that is equally as good. The service is always super friendly and it seems very clean whenever I eat there. I highly recommended George's to everyone."}
{"text":"When you walk into this strip mall you may not expect much. However, this is the best spot in town for gyro, hands down. Regardless if you want a salad or a sandwich, the gyro meat is great! If you aren't a big fan of gyro, no problem. The chicken here is amazing as well! 

My favorite meal is the greek salad with gyro meat, but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 

The portions are huge, the quality is great, and the price is worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This place is legit!! My family is vegetarian, and both the falafel and veggie pita were amazing. The pickle fries were fried perfectly, and the hummus was phenomenal. George himself was so friendly and accommodating; he changed the tv from a western to a nature show and even put on Disney music for my small kids.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in the valley! Fresh, friendly staff and reasonable prices. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place when we went to the FedEx in the same shopping center. While my hubby went to mail a package, I noticed the sign to George's Famous Gyros and looked it up on Yelp. Upon seeing the great reviews, we decided to visit the restaurant later that same day for lunch. 

The restaurant is tucked into a small corner, so it's easy to miss if you don't know it's there. Our favorite item to order is the Gyro Picado, which has grilled onions, peppers and jalapenos in addition to a generous amount of meat. The meat is sliced thin and is extremely flavorful and not too greasy, and the peppers add a nice bit of heat without being too spicy. The gyros are served with fries or a salad. I've never ordered the fries so I can't speak to them, but the salad is large and the dressing is light and tasty. We're often tempted to try something else on the menu, such as the pastas or the pizzas, but we just can't seem to stray from the delicious gyros. Located less than five minutes from work, George's has become a lunchtime staple for us."}
{"text":"Best spaghetti and meatballs!!! Bomb ass gyros and chicken pitas too. Amazing service from owners and nice clean place. Very affordable and very good sized portions."}
{"text":"My friend was really bummed that the weight of all the food cracked his styrofoam container, and I couldn't stop eating. Really good value, really good food. Twice as much meat on the gyro, more than I've ever seen anywhere else! So good!  I can't wait to go back! Yum!"}
{"text":"Great place, Great food.. Portions are massive. Great prices as well.
My daughter gets a cookie every time we visit this place by George's father. Great authentic little place by freeway 101. I can't say enough of this place.
and family oriented. The menu is written well to define its purpose."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst. Go for lunch and get a chicken ceaser salad and waited 30min. Never again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It is spot on every time we come here. 
The food is amazing."}
{"text":"We love eating at George's. We always always the platter and switch up the meats. You get plenty of food and also a salad. It is a good value for the portions. Our only complaint is everything is the meat is extremely salty. Drinking extra water throughout the day is worth the food to us though. It is nice to be able to order online and have the food ready by the time you get there. It isn't a long wait ordering in restaurant. Out of town family want to eat here with every visit. Give it a try, it is worth it."}
{"text":"This is a hidden little gem! My son told me to try it out, as said great place and guy in there always there and friendly. So decided to give up normal place to try something new. This place was A+ from food, portions, and friendly staff! Found my family a new place. Got to go try it out!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out from our team lunch and it was delicious!!! I ordered the chicken pita with the lemon sauce and no onions with a side fries. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the pita was delicious! The fries were also pretty tasty! Overall we all enjoyed our meals and I definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"This establishment is my second favorite gyro place in the United States. The only place that I would recommend higher is Steve's Gyros in Cleveland,  Ohio. If you don't feel like driving a little over 2,060 miles for a better gyro then the only place to go is George's Gyros. On my first visit I ordered a regular gyro but after reading the tips I decided to try the gyro platter. While I hate to mention this I will let you know that I order an extra two pitas with the platter. I am able to make four gyros for two meals and substitute the fries for a larger salad. Also to help the ease of your visit to this establishment, exit at the Wendy's restaurant."}
{"text":"Great little gem of a place. Priced right for portion size. Seems like owner operated so thats always good to ensure quality and service.  Very personable people and as soon as they found out it was my first time they gave me a free drink. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Greek restaurants. I get the chicken pita with feta and either a salad or fries. Met the owner last time I was in and he was awesome!"}
{"text":"Great place for Greek food! Came here for lunch with some coworkers and pleasantly enjoyed!

Our group was rather large, so finding a table to seat us all was a little difficult, but the food was well worth the trouble! They give great portions and food was wonderful. Would definitely recommend coming here for your Greek food cravings."}
{"text":"George's Gyros has absolutely impressed me since day 1. The original gyro is so full of meat and i love the fresh salads. Anytime i am up in the area i make sure o stop and order a gyro. Must have. Full of spices and just typing this review is making my mouth water. Your not living life unless you have had George's famous Gyros."}
{"text":"They let me come in 15 min before opening and also order definitely pleased with their Serivce !"}
{"text":"Best gyros in Phoenix! They taste straight out of Chicago. The staff is wonderful and the place is always clean. When ordering for pick up it's always ready and I never have to wait."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Low carb stir fry and salad for me. Son loved his pita pizza and ate the whole thing despite saying \"I'm not hungry\" as we walked in. Husband loved his gyro and salad. Would go back for dinner if they were open tonight."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic, and the owners/employees are friendly and the service superb.  It is not easy to see from the street, and it is not fancy in its decor, but who cares?  The first time we went there, the fryer was not working, so fried apps were out, so we got platters and had leftovers for three meals.  Last time, we had fried zucchini and it was outstanding.  The Greek salad is the best.  The meats, the pita, everything we have ever had there has been top notch.  They do not scrimp on anything."}
{"text":"Awesome!

Gryos Patter was great and the the portion of gryos meat was huge! Overall I was very happy with the food and the service.

I will be back."}
{"text":"Always awesome. I live nearby and pop in for lunch somewhat regularly. I almost always get some sort of pita with salad (all pitas come with a big salad). It makes for a large lunch, so bring an appetite."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate at George's and we're both pleasantly surprised. She had the Caprese Chicken Pita and I had the Chicken Supreme Pita. My dish came with choice of fries or salad and I picked the salad. The dressing on the salad was yummy, as was the tzatziki on my Pita. The portion sizes were big and the chicken was fresh and warm. We even got a side of the red roasted tomato hummus and couldn't stop feeding our faces. Enjoy it...we did!"}
{"text":"My spouse got me hooked to this place its close so its very convenient and my spouse is officially addicted and by addicted I'm not joking he has to atleast go there once a week for a gyro. I never had a gyro but they were really good. Tonight I decided to try some other things I got the chicken Alfredo and it was delicious and the chicken was perfectly grilled and was fresh and and the Alfredo sauce was very good. Also tried the gouda Mac n cheese bites and me and my 2 year old tore them up! That will be a must have every time we go. It's family owned and the owner is so sweet to our son every time he takes our son in. Definitely worth the price who can beat delicious fast and friendly service?"}
{"text":"My gyro was fantastic. It was huge and warm. Yummy. I can't wait to come back again and try something else. Staff was very friendly. Their pricing is very reasonable."}
{"text":"They have daily specials and reasonable prices throughout the menu.  The little peeps love the spaghetti (comes with a huge side salad) and I can't get enough of the greek salad with chicken.  Get the dressing on the side and you have 2 meals."}
{"text":"The dining room is not clean. The fixtures and sills are layered in years of dust and grime. The portions are large and the flavor is mediocre. Price is high for the quality. It is true gyro meat, but luke-warm at best."}
{"text":"Chicken Faliro was great and had plenty of food. Excellent hummus with pita and cucumber.  Friendly staff. 

Could be a little cleaner and I wish they choose between the TV audio or the tunes, was a little loud for small space. 

I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The best Greek food in the valley of the Sun.  You must try if you haven't eaten here before."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this small place while recently working in the area. The thing that separated this place was they cooked the chicken fresh on the grill (not reheated). Also, you know how they never give you enough tzatki sauce on your Gyro - well not this bad boy because it is loaded with almost too much sauce. Another thing is that there are no lunch specials, but most sandwiches come with either fries or a greek salad. I chose the salad and it had fresh kalamata olves, a small amount of feta and lettuce and onions. It was a very good and filling lunch for about $9 and they have a TV set that was showing March Madness....score!"}
{"text":"One of the greatest finds.  You will be glad to have found this place.

Come to George's to be treated like family, George will make you feel at home.  I have been about 6-7 times and every visit is a great experience thanks to the food and George himself.

Great food, huge ever growing selection and feature menus, large portions and all at a great price.  

Hidden by the Starbucks on N 27th and 101 is a little Greek corner place that doesn't disappoint.

Great falafel, gyros, salads & Dolomades.  All the favourites and special exclusive creations that George brings to the menu. 

Grecian Fusion like Teriyaki Gyros!  Yup you heard it here first! George invented them. 

Come for the food, stay for the friendly family like atmosphere and even maybe a movie on the TV

{"text":"I would like give George's four stars, because the food was great and a great value for your money. 

Unfortunately I overheard a conversation between the owner and employee that was inappropriate. The owner was talking with an employee about an error she made using inappropriate language. The employee was visibly upset and asked the owner to not talk with her that way. He told her that he talks that way, even to his father, and told her to leave if she didn't like it. She left and came back for her money. 

Very disappointed and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"One of the best lunch spots in the area. You really get a good bang for your buck. Generous size portions. My favorite is the gyro picado with extra feta and tzatziki. Probably the best gyro I've had in Phoenix.

The greek salad is also very good. Great Greek dressing."}
{"text":"Tryed the Steak sandwich and the Gyro 
Supreme sandwich... both are a must try!! No joke the meat was so tender on the Gyro supreme. Steak was soft but oh man the Gyro meat was by far awesome! Had a great lunch! No picture bc the food smelled so good and was so irresistibly good!!!"}
{"text":"DON'T GO HERE! I got FOOD POISONING from this place...and I nearly died 2 days later. Not to mention, the gyro was bland and yucky. Stay away! :("}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! 

I wasn't even going to eat...I met up with my mom and sister (they had already ordered food); sitting there and smelling their delicious food made me give in. I ordered the very first think on the menu: Original Gyro Pita- with a side salad- and let me tell you.... it was amazing! The ingredients were super fresh. The meat was made to perfection. All the flavors went great together; the salad complimented the gyro perfectly. KUDOS TO MR. GEORGE AND HIS CREW!! Mr. George was tending to his customers and the restaurant as a whole. Very friendly owner and extremely clean place.
This place is definitely worth a try (and many additional visits)! I will be back!! #myNewFavoriteGreekPlace #georgeRules"}
{"text":"Great food, nice service, and outdoor seeting. Ask for Ted, very nice man who seems to always be working.
Love the gyro platter."}
{"text":"Awesome place, the food is delicious... will be coming back for sure. Gyro salad is my favorite and very tasty."}
{"text":"Very nice local Greek restaurant! Hard to find a good gyro now days! Server was friendly, plus she liked my j's! +2 for that!

Food is very good and reasonably priced! Even the to go box is presented nice!

Gyro is filled, and they are NOT cheap on the meat!! Another +2 for that! The tzatziki is on point too, but not as good as yaiyai's   The owner is very nice, and hospitable! That alone is worth it!

HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb dot com! The owner is super nice and he makes you feel welcome. The price is great for the food, and the quality is to die for. If you are stopping by north Phoenix for a bite to eat, this place is a go-to!"}
{"text":"Awesome Greek salad a side.  Small of the wall place in N PHX"}
{"text":"The original gyro was quite good. The lamb is seasoned and cooked very well. The spices accentuate the flavor of the meat rather than overpowering it, which is very important for meat like this. The pita bread is nice and soft--not stale or overheated. The tzatziki was great, but there was just NOT enough of it. Though it does cost $0.25 extra, I strongly suggest getting it. They don't skimp on meat portions, so the tzatziki just can't keep up. The amount of tomatoes was a little lacking too, but not really to a fault.

My sister-in-law got the chicken pita and was pleased with it as well.

I chose fries as my side, but I wish I hadn't. I believe they were frozen store-bought fries that were under-baked and heavily seasoned with season-all. Don't be me--be healthy and get the salad (sister-in-law liked that too).

Ordering online with GrubHub was easy and the food was ready on time. The man who handed me our food was very friendly and made picking up our online order quick and pleasant.

I'll be going back, but next time... MORE TZATZIKI."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly service, great food.
Was not impressed the first time I tried them a while back but not disappointed. Recent orders have been perfect."}
{"text":"Great place to eat never fails. Amazing staff that's always super friendly and great value for your money. Definitely my go to gyros place."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the owner is really nice!! We will definetly be coming back here! Best Greek food ever."}

_________________________________________________

The Story: 

There are some restaurants that are an absolute pleasure to be a patron of. They act as the cornerstone that all others within their field are compared to. They are the master of their domain and the archetype for what a successful establishment should resemble. That can vary from the the atmosphere they provide to category of food they make. With that in mind, enter George's Famous Gyros and Pasta (George's).

 I discovered George's immediately after graduating from college and moving to Phoenix to work and live. They were the last stop in my journey to find the best American-Greek restaurant near my neighborhood in northern Phoenix. I feel comfortable saying that, lucky for me, I found the best one in all of Arizona.

George's isn't worried to much about frills. Their food, while presented in an alluring manner, is served on your basic Styrofoam (another one of those surprisingly trademarked words) plate. The unassuming menu looks like it was designed and printed at the Kinko's located next-door. Heck, even their dining room looks like it belongs in a low budget '70s film.

This is easily overlooked and forgotten after the first bite. Everything at George's has been artfully constructed by someone who loves what they do. There is a difference between simply being talented at something and enjoying it as well. I never thought you could taste the difference until I ate at George's. 

To avoid boring you, I will focus largely the restaurant's specialties, gyros and pasta. 

The perfectly seasoned gyro meat is thinly cut from its rotisserie and always served fresh. I can't stress the importance of this. Several Greek restaurants in Phoenix subscribe to the belief that thickly cut Gyro meat provides the best flavor possible. I'm telling you folks, this isn't true! The thinner cuts come out crisper and allow the spices to take center stage on your tastebuds. This is essential to making a quality gyro. The subtle-sweet pita bread acts as the ideal delivery vehicle for the meat and veggies. It not only literally wraps it all together, but does so flavor wise as well. Fabulous. 

George's serves the basic styles of spaghetti and a few unique ones. While I did enjoy their take on 'Greek pasta,' I am going to focus on the standard spaghetti and meat sauce. Right know, I know you're thinking, \"how do you mess up something as simple as spaghetti?\" I agree, it's a pretty easy dish to make, but it becomes much more complicated when you include meat sauce into the equation. Here, George's has decided to make it as thick and meaty as possible. I agree with this approach. The finely ground hamburger is almost impossible to siphon from the sauce's already hearty consistency. If you prefer your meat sauce to be more of a 'hamburger soup,' then this isn't for you, but I still recommend you give it a try.

Lastly, George's customer service is superb. This isn't to suggest the staff is perfect in this area, but they succeed at creating a humble and warm atmosphere that is usually only found in small towns. You feel like your are at a friend's house after a month of dining there once a week or so. 

Ultimately, George's has mastered the essence of what American-Greek food should taste like at a local eatery. There are aspects of it that could improve. This place likely isn't for you if a restaurant's decor has a large affect on your experience. Pass it over and spend your hard earned dollar somewhere that will make you happy! If not, this is a stop you can't miss. Don't forget to call out my name! I'll likely be there myself."}
{"text":"Nice place, clean dining room.  When I am craving a Gyro, I want a sandwich loaded with Gyro meat!  This place delivered.  I had to eat some strips of meat just so I could pick up the sandwich and take a bite.  The tzaziki sauce was great, but could have used a little more considering the amount of stuff in the sandwich.  The sandwiches come with fries unlike a lot of places.

Good value, I will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"Love it, fresh food, good portions, inexpensive, friendly staff, quick and convenient. 
Nothing fancy about this place, but their food is great value."}
{"text":"Awesome Greek food enough said. Owner is a great always willing to make accommodations when called for."}
{"text":"Love the Gyro Greek Salad. Its worth every
Dollar.. Not writing much because I am hungry and want to continue to eat it. I heard the Sandwich is amazing and can't wait to have it next time :)

Enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of Gyro restaurants around the Valley. Few are worth coming back to, especially in north Phoenix. However this place is a gem. Amazing gyros!!! And for those picky eaters that want the norm, they had pasta, sandwiches, burgers, pizza, and even a hot dog. How can you beat it. Not sure why yelp list it as none delivery, because they do. Which is helpful for those 30 minute lunch breaks."}
{"text":"Love this place! So many choices. And so yummy! You get your money's worth. And they are super nice."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff.  Salad was huge and dressing was delicious.  Friend order the pasta and said it was also good."}
{"text":"I frequent George's at least twice a month for lunch as it is nearby my office. They always have a good crowd at lunch by the many office workers like me. The restaurant itself is fairly small, maybe 6-7 tables or so inside and a couple more outside.  The decor leaves something to be desired, especially in the bathrooms.  Not unclean, but not something that looks quite up to par either. The service is walk up \"fast casual\" style and usually George himself cooks, runs the register and delivers the eats too. (With the help of 2 more helpers in the kitchen). The big sellers are the usual suspects of a Greek joint; Gyros, Salads, Chicken, etc. The food is the usual fantastic assault of highly seasoned Greek fare. I love the house Greek salad dressing and the Gyro with Fries. Always a winner!  Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"I work Next door to George's I eat there 2-3 times per week.  It's always amazing. Ted the owner is great, and Elizabeth the kitchen manager rocks! Try the steak stir fry or the Greek Salad with chicken or gyro. Liz makes the dressing from scratch! Great place!"}
{"text":"Popped by here after an unanticipated stop at a nearby ER. We tried the steak, chicken and souvlaki pitas with a side of dolmas and hummus. Food all very good. Meats had nice grilled flavor and spicing and the quantity of meat in each pita sandwich was substantial. Each sandwich also came with a very good greek salad. Staff was friendly and service was prompt. Great find."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times to grab lunch and wow, it's pretty good.

I've had the Greek salad with gyro on top, in addition to the gyro platter. The platter is a very, very generous portion that comes with bread and a side salad. I had to take half the food back to the office, it was so much. Absolutely delicious though, and the pita was fresh and warm.

I've gotten the salad when dining here alone and it's the perfect portion. Even then it's super generous, but not so much I can't handle eating it alone. I love gyro, so having it on a salad is great.

Out of the places I've found in Phoenix so far, this is my favorite."}
{"text":"First off, I was a hungry dinosaur when I got to this place; thus, I was ready to devour anything. (Lol)  My parents said these are the best gyros they've found in Phoenix, and knowing I mostly eat \"paleo\" (key word, \"mostly\". More so a flexible dieter now #iifym) they figured I could get a kick booty Greek salad here. (One of my faves.)  Dude, I was impressed! I ordered the Greek salad with gyro meat. Thank sweet baby Jesus--they give you a whopping portion of gyro meat on a bed of fresh greens (traditional Greek salad ingredients)! It was actually a filling meal. Not a skimpy salad but a big ass salad. I usually ask for dressing on the side, but the dressing- to-salad ratio was on point. I don't like my salads bathed in dressing (aka fat--I actually like veggies! Shocker. I'm weird.). I have never been a huge bread addict. However, they serve the salad with a side of garlic bread that is like OMG--angels singing and the heavens parting at first bite. Slightly gooey, yet crunchy edges.... And it wasn't soaked in a stick of butter a la Paula Dean. To top it off, I saw they also have a Scottsdale location. Damn, I love Scottsdale! Seriously cannot wait for my next Phoenix trip to get my George's fix."}
{"text":"As a native Chicagoan I can definitely say with no hesitation that this is the best gyros outside of Chicago. Seriously. And the people that work here are on top of everything."}
{"text":"Solid Gyro with a friendly owner.  Service was fast.  The atmosphere was pretty plain and not very inviting, but the food more than made up for it."}
{"text":"We ate here again today, 2nd time. Better than the first, the ONLY real Chicago Greek Gyro in the Valley. Worth the 25 minute drive. George holds the bar HIGH, no other place we have tried in the past year even comes close. I'm sure his other food is great, but we come for the Gyro's, why try anything else when you have a winner?"}
{"text":"Beautiful people and amazing food. For years my family and I come here and can always count on both Son and father to deliver an amazing smile and service. The gyros are delicious, the salad and rice are light and fresh. I know my boys love the French fries, light and crisp. Thank you George's for having a great place in town to enjoy a great meal with great customer service!"}
{"text":"First visit today and ordered the special (always do and don't ask what it is on the first visit), the gyro and the cheese burger.

So I believe the special was spinach ravioli with sundried tomato, mushroom, garlic, basil and a butter sauce. First off, it was really quite good. The sauce was spectacular, bravo, chef. The ravioli was al dente, which is good, I think I would pull it just a bit soon though because a little texture would help but that's just me. Seriously, I would order it again, it was good.

The gyro was as it should be and frigging stacked with meat. Tiziki was on point. Red onion added color and a bit of depth that made it just right. Very good job.

The cheese burger was unique, served on baguette and formed to fit perfectly. Somebody put some thought into this dish. One of the better burgers I've had and there are no shortage of burger shops so that's saying something. One of the top 10 in my opinion.

The fries are good. Cooked correctly and seasoned well. For me I would have used celery salt on them as opposed to table salt because when next to the gyro and the burger they came across a little plain, but again that's just me, I'm sure other would disagree.

The decor is fine, lighting is bright, the shop is clean as it can be, the folks are fun and clever with their approach to customer service, I enjoyed them a lot.

So one thing, and I almost hate to say it but kitchen staff should be dressed like kitchen staff. That's important to me, so I was a bit disappointed that they weren't, once again though, that's just one guys opinion and I am equally certain that an informal approach appeals to a lot of people so I am not judging. These guys have been doing this for awhile now and doing it very well so they know what they are about.

I'll be back and I hope the ravioli will be on the menu when I get there."}
{"text":"This is a small fast-casual Greek Restaurant that isn't fancy but is clean with indoor and outdoor seating. 

Based on just one visit I can tell you the portions are enormous and the pricing is very low. Everything is under $10.00 and most plates run around $7.50. They offer a very large menu with many choices.

I made my order at the counter and paid and then picked a table to sit at. The cashier/cook (maybe owner?) seemed very polite and was very efficient.

I tried the Athenian Stir Fry with chicken. I knew my platter came with salad and was just expecting the salad to be a little garnish on for my $9.00 platter but they ran me out a full size fresh Greek Salad with charred garlic bread. 

In only a few minutes latter I received  a styrofoam plate heaping with a mountain of food. It was enough food to feed a small family. Lots of rice and LOTS of seasoned moist chicken. I thought the food was good but was missing the delicious fresh herbs that Greek Food is usually known for. I figure the prices are so low that fresh herbs can't be used. 

My husband had the Porky Athens. It also was an enormous plate with lots of rice and moist pork. It was also good but also lacking those delicious fresh herbs.

Because of the location and the big varied menu I will try again.

Great value dining. I felt like I got more than what I paid for. For me this was A-OK and this is a positive review."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the first time we were ever at Grorge's famous Gyros & Pasta. My husband went to pick up our food the first thing he noticed was the  restaurant was extremely clean . The man at the counter said to my husband so this is your first time here you'll be back. Well , he is absolutely right we will be back. The food was amazing."}
{"text":"I wish the location wasn't so hidden! But the food is great! The Gyro is delicious, the slice it directly as its spinning and slow cooking.  The fries were good too!  I grabbed it to go, and it was ready within 5 min.  Great service!  Great food!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first experience here and it was quite amazing. I walked in and indicated that it was my first visit so I could peruse the menu. The man that took my order (who I presume to be George himself) was very friendly and treated me and my boyfriend to a free drink for our first time. The prices were very decent, considering the amount of food that you get. George checked up on us to see how our food was and even offered to close the front door because I was cold. I don't usually rate on Yelp, but I feel that people easily forget to rate the good places. So overall they had great food, large portions, reasonable prices, and amazing service."}
{"text":"This place is great! I got the Original Gyro with a side salad. The gyro was delicious with lots of meat, and the salad was big and flavorful with peppers, feta and dressing. A simple meal, but definitely filling and delicious, all for less than $10.

A friend recommended getting the Gyro Plate: it's only a little more and you get a ton of meat, two pitas, a huge salad and rice.

Will be back!"}
{"text":"We are so incredibly picky about our Greek food, but George's is outstanding! The gyro meat is tender and flavorful and the portions are generous. This will moat definitely be our go-to Geek restaurant!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting and was completely impressed. The service was great and the food was even better. I had the picado gyro and the fries were both cooked to perfection. Would definitely recommend to a friend and will visit again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were both pleasently surprised by this place. The food is good and I like the family vibes going on. I would go back and reccomend this place."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem For Great Greek Food

Today, I had a 'hankerin' for some  Greek/Mediterranean food but had no clue where I should go.  So I turned to my fellow \"yelpers\" for help and after reading reviews I decided to head to George's Famous Gyros and Pasta. 

Who would have guessed that this little hidden gem had great tasting Greek food.  George's is unassuming from the outside and even more so inside.  George's is small, the tables are plastic and there isn't much in the way of ambiance.  However, George is wonderful and so is  his food, which is always prepared fresh and is absolutely delicious.  

George understands Greek food. I assume  growing up in Chicago, laid out a great foundation for this eatery. The Greek salad with gyro meat, burgers, and fries are excellent.  However, make sure to bring an appetite because the portions are large, easily enough for two.

After finishing a large lunch, and thinking to myself, I cant eat another bite.  Out of the coner of my eye I caught a glimpse of the baklava and it was impossible to pass up.   I had dessert on the brain.  I am so glad I decided to endulge.  The baklava was oozing with honey and had just the right amount of sweetness. A perfect ending to a great lunch.

Oh, did I mention the low prices and great service? George's is an incredible value for the high quality of food.  If you enjoy Greek/Mediterranean food and you're in the area, you should definitely stop by George's, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just had lunch with my boo. I had the supreme gyro & he had the original. Wow can you say amazing flavors, very large portions, soft pita, outstanding taziki. Very friendly & fast service. My eyes were bigger than my stomach that's for sure. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The portions are enormous so the pricing is very fair. It's tucked away in a random plaza near some businesses so you wouldn't expect much seeing it from the street. It has a large dining inside and some seating outside. If you sit outside they bring your order to you if you're eating there. The gyro I got was okay, not the best I've had but the white sauce they give with it tops off the flavor. The employees are very friendly so that's a big plus. The restaurant itself is pretty clean, so that's always a good sign ;)
To get the best deal, order a plate!"}
{"text":"Yay, finally remembered to come back! this place is so close to work it is a shame I had forgotten about it.
Very friendly service, and... I went for a Gyro Pita, with salad. It was very tasty, lots of meat. I even had some left overs for a late snack at work.

Hubby got the Gyro Pita too, with fries. Really good too. Looking forward to go back, hopefully soon : )"}
{"text":"love this place I went here for the first time and got the grilled chicken pita supreme with a salad! It was awesome!!"}
{"text":"I became addicted to Greek food when living in Las Vegas! This place has delicious gyro's and I'm glad it's close to my work! The server is upbeat and the food came out hot and fresh! The fries that came with the gyro were a large portion and I could not finish them. $10 for the gyro fries and drink is a little pricey! They could have tamed down the amount of fries and made it more reasonable for around $8! Overall it was worth it and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I tried this place during lunch today with my boyfriend on a whim (hence no pictures) because the other Greek pita place I frequent has horrible service.

This place...was amazing. My boyfriend is new to Greek food, and he loved his Gyros Pita. I ordered the Slouvaki Pita, and it was one of the best pork pitas I've had in a long time!

While I agree with some of the other diners that the decor is basic, it simply is a great hole-in-the wall that I will definitely want to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"Great family owned place. All of the food was amazing. Super friendly. Will definitely return next time we are in town."}
{"text":"We have tried several Gyro places in Phoenix and this one has quickly become our favorite. The staff is always very friendly and helpful and the food is amazing. Very well priced and you get a lot of food for the money. We try and get by at least once a month. It is a little difficult to see from the street, but it is in the same plaza as FedEx."}
{"text":"Seriously, how can you give this less than 5 stars with the flavors of their food? 
I had the gyro picado with the side salad. It rivals any place in town. Go check these guys out and enjoy some really delicious food!!!"}
{"text":"Came her for lunch, had the Chicken platter.  Chicken was fresh and great seasoning.  Get a nice little salad with it.  It was a little too much food for a light lunch, but good none the less.

Price was not too bad either.  They are a little heavy handed with onions and diced tomatoes, so be aware of that.  Nice little place, very clean.  Staff was very friendly.

I will likely come back for lunch.  Prompt service."}
{"text":"I was surprised and happy to see Georges resurfaced in N Phoenix. This is the same Georges that occupied the small place between the former Kyoto Bowl and the pet store near Bell Rd and 27/28th Ave.

I was going to get the standard Gyro but was told of the Chicken Enchilada special. So I had to try it. 

They were 3 chicken filled corn tortillas with a homemade tomitillo green sauce and cojita cheese on top. The flavor was perfect, nice mix of flavor and spice. The chicken appeared to be all white meat and was really good. Served with a side of rice (great) and a small patch of lettuce and tomato. 

It was great and very unexpected to enjoy it so much."}
{"text":"Top notch service with great tasting food. I come here with my wife often for lunch and have yet to have a bad or even average experience. The chicken pita is delicious."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices and generous servings. I had the original gyro. The meat was thinly sliced and piled on with just the right amount of sauce."}
{"text":"The service at George's is exceptional. The (assumed) owner was doing it all and giving each customer he encountered his utmost attention - and all with youthful enthusiasm and a smile. The gyros pita was absolutely delicious but my wife said the steak pita was the best \"steak sandwich\" she's ever had! We also tried the Reuben sandwich which was also very good. The seasoned fries are a great choice for a side but the greek salad is plentiful and a healthier choice. Great food, amazing value, and outstanding service. George will be seeing us a lot!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and owner. Love their tzatziki sauce and the best gyros meat around!"}
{"text":"They seriously have the best food ever. Service is amazing and quick. Ive never had anything bad from this place. The Texas gyro, chicken pita, side salad, pesto pasta. All are a must. Keep up the amazing quality!"}
{"text":"Update 11/25- Have tried a few more greek restaurants, and this is by far the best.  Moved to 5 stars

Ordered food 3 days ago for work and it was ready for pick up on time.  For the price, I assumed it would be average at best.  The gyro was fantastic and the salad with it was absolutely fresh.  The only reason I remembered to do this review is because I am ordering again right now,

Great job!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Falafel was cooked to perfection. Opt for the salad instead of the fries. It is not because the fries are bad but because the salad is too delicious to pass up. Also, if you like lamb, you will never eat another Gyro! Thinly sliced, packed with meat, not so much dressing or extras. It's not messy and they have nice portion sizes."}
{"text":"Its a good place to order food. I really like their salad and dressing. Food is good, pleasant atmosphere inside and quick service."}
{"text":"I work across the street from George's and have always wondered how the food was there.  I love gyros and I have a place near where I live that isn't that bad but George's blows it away!  Yes, it's further of a travel for me but well worth the price of gas.  My roommate and I couldn't decide what we wanted for dinner and I said there's a Greek joint across the street from where I work.  I see it gets GREAT reviews on Yelp!  Wanna give it a try?  He agreed and off we went.  We decided to eat in.  The dining room is nothing special but it's clean and the workers were really friendly.  My roommate and I both ordered the same thing and we decided to split a Hummus and chips appy.  The Hummus is home made!!!!  YUM!!   Then they bought out a nice sized Greek Salad for each of us.  As we got about halfway thru the salad the main course came out.  We got the Original Gyro platter.  OMG!!!!  The portions were HUGE!!  I took one bite of the meat and I was in love.  It was perhaps the best tasting gyro I'd ever had.  The platter came with tzatziki (and plenty of it), sliced red onion, diced tomatoes, french fries (which were basically an afterthought) and pita bread (which was soft and warm).  It was absolutely delicious.  I hate to admit this but I ate the WHOLE thing........sans the fries.  My roommate bought about half of it home with him because he was full.  The employees came over to check up on us halfway thru the meal which I thought was very nice of them and like I mentioned before, they were very friendly and helpful.  OH!!!!! And the kicker......VERY REASONABLY PRICED!!!!!   Especially for the amount of food we received.  I will DEFINITELY be making many return visits to this fine establishment."}
{"text":"I had seen the signs up as I went by for a while not knowing it was an already established owner.  Then I saw Daren's review and decided to try the place.  It is sort of tucked in behind the pizza place which occupies most of the building.  The business name does not fully describe the wide variety of stuff available on the menu.

I arrived a few minutes early and the doors were wide open and everything was ready for business.  The counter person/server was very friendly.  I got the chicken Caesar pita sandwich with a salad and soda fountain.  Service is fast casual where you order at the counter and they bring it to you.  The restaurant is bright and airy and clean.  It was a lovely fall day outside so I chose to sit on the shaded patio.  I am going to nitpik a little because I cannot find much to fault; the Caesar dressing was a bit too vinegary for my taste and I would prefer more Feta on my salad.  

I'll definitely be back to try some more stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Overload of gyro meat..
Texas style gyro is yummy!
Owner and son is awesome.
If you want good food come on over and yes they are busy but during lunch time because of the other office's over in the area."}
{"text":"Best gyro I have ever eaten. Not kidding. They always have friendly service and are pretty quick. My wife and I used to live close and went here a lot, it's a little bit of a trek now, but well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I are a little bummed that we didn't discover this place a little sooner.  I absolutely love their Gyro and salad combo and they are always generous with the Yelp check-in offer.  The gyro has so much meat in it that I half to take out about 1/3rd of it to even make it small enough to fit in my mouth.  The people that work there are great and willing to give suggestions.  Zeus would be proud!"}
{"text":"I have been visiting all the best Greek restaurants over the last few weeks. Being from NY, we had the BEST Greek restaurant I have ever been to. The reviews for George's are great, and it is true. It's very good. They open at 11 and they get very busy very quickly. The salad with chicken was great. I was so hungry and I still couldn't finish it. They can definitely use some extra help. They were very busy and only one girl taking orders and bringing out the food, and answering the phones!!! Overall, we'll worth your time!!! Go HUNGRY!"}
{"text":"Best Gyro place around ...I hate having to go other places it's never close in comparison!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I have been coming here for a few months. The gyros are huge and packed full of meat. The fries are always fresh and just exactly the perfect level of crispy. No mushy fries here! The side salad is huge and delicious, too. We never manage to finish a whole plate of food here!

It's a local diner-type atmosphere; low-key, just a few tables and chairs and a big tv. Dining outside in the summer is nice - the tables are tucked away between the buildings, so it's kind of private.

Bottom line:  if you're craving a gyro, this is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING food and service!!!! My first time here and the owner, I assume, was taking orders, serving customers, and cleaning tables. Will definitely be making this my regular place for lunch."}
{"text":"I used love ordering from here, but feel like i'm bothering the guy who answers the phone. I think he is the owner or the owners son. It's like I'm sorry I want order something. Not going there any more. Once I called and said I want to place a order for pick up and the got the unfriendly response of \"Im not surprised\" is what I got. Is that really how you talk to customers? Too bad rubbed me the wrong way."}
{"text":"Live this place. Excellent food, good prices. Really appreciate them..hope they stay and never change!"}
{"text":"All I can say is YUMMY, I eat there all the time !!  Nice people work there also."}
{"text":"This place is pretty damn good! I went here for lunch based on a recommendation of a friend and they did not disappoint! I got the chicken caesar gyro with fries. Huge portion for $7.50. I'll be back to try more for sure!"}
{"text":"I had never been to a Gryos restaurant before this one, so trying something new and having the experience I did was amazing. The staff gave me many suggestions on what they loved best. I settled on the shrimp salad. I did dine in, it was very clean, nice, and welcoming. I enjoyed the experience and I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Best gyro I've had west of the Mississippi. Love the staff, they're super helpful with finding what you want. The place is super clean too. Overall: service is quick, food is delicious, and atmosphere is clean and comfortable. What more could you ask? Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"First time here! Got a chicken Greek salad and Greek fries! The Greek salad had a great portion of chicken! Fries were really good too! I would highly recommend this place this won't be my last time here for sure!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my lunch here!
So 3 stars? This ranking may seem a little harsh because I already stated that I enjoyed my lunch, but let me give you a quick run-down on my opinion. I ordered the gyro platter to go.
Plusses: Clean, friendly employees. TONS of meat. Salad was amazingly good and fresh. They offer the option of rice or fries offered as a side, and the rice was great. Tzatziki sauce was one of the better ones I've had; quite a bit of dill whereas most in the valley are almost pure yogurt.
Negatives: The gyro meat was a tad dry. The seasoning was average - which means it was not bad. Also, despite having enough meat to make 3 or 4 gyros, I didn't have enough onions or tomatoes to even make two. The proportions were off. I'll eat my leftovers after I go home and make some more side items.
But this is nitpicking... the platter was $8.50 and a single gyro (with fries or salad) is $7.25. The deal is outstanding.

Since this restaurant is fairly new, I'll give a quick run-down on other items on the menu.
Appetizers include falafel, hummus, dolmades, spanakopita, zucchini, mushrooms and even chicken nuggets and jalapeno poppers. All are $4.50 or under, plus they have Greek Wings for $6.50.
They obviously have gyros and pasta... and they offer pita pizzas; Greek, Italian and Veggie.
 If their side salad is this impressive, I need to try one of their full salads. They even offer salmon or shrimp salads for $8.25! Greek, Chicken Caesar, Garden and pasta salad are all available. Very reasonably priced.
They have shrimp a few different ways on pasta platters, and specials like Italian sausage. They have a sandwich selection including Italian beef, chicken parmesan, cheesesteak, meatball, fish and pork among others. They also have quarter pound and half pound burgers.
All of their meals are pretty much between 6 and 9 bucks.
Since it's convenient for me, I will definitely go back. I recommend it, although it isn't my favorite gyro place in the city. It earns above average marks, so 3 stars from me for now. I'll re-evaluate once I try more items; especially the dolmade!"}
{"text":"I went here cause I had a groupon. The prices were very high, so I needed the groupon for sure. The food was very good, but the cashier was not friendly at all. Made it seem like I was bothering her with any question I asked. I'm a big fan of Georges at Mckellips. They always had specials and kool people. While the food was good, the un-friendly atmosphere at the 27th ave location left a bad taste for sure."}
{"text":"This place is seriously great! It's really hard to find a good lunch spot in this area that's not a chain and totally commercialized. The staff here is wonderful and makes everyone feel like a regular. Every time I eat here I remind myself to go back more often. I order the Greek Salad with Gyro Meat and a side of Tzatziki sauce. It comes with a heaping portion of Gyro meat and the best greek dressing I've had to date. Delicious every time!"}
{"text":"Top quality gyros sandwich came with a good Greek salad. Well worth the price (under $8). Top gyros of the Valley."}
{"text":"Gyros are always perfect. I've eaten plenty of them here, and I find it hard to explore the rest of the menu because the gyro is always pulling me back for more, everytime."}
{"text":"Went to this place today because it had such good reviews. I loved it! The atmosphere was great and the food was amazing and well priced. The portions were huge and I definitely plan on coming back. We ordered the gyro with salad, chicken Parmesan and spaghetti. I loved everything! It came out fast and hot"}
{"text":"I was feeling like greek for lunch so I come to George's and order a Chicago dog with a salad a very hetero lunch the dog what can I say other then worth it the huge bun warm and fluffy well balance of toppings and the hot dog itself all beef and I believe grilled but either way it's no chintzy dog now the salad was no slouch either came with feta peppercini tomato onion and olives pretty much a mini greek salad all and all it's very good food and until I get a gyro I'm pretty confident this 4 star will turn into 5 no prob."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and fun service. Establishment is very clean and not noisy. An array of gyros on the menu and the pickle fries are awesome!!"}
{"text":"The Greek salad with Gyro is amazing!  Owner cares and works hard each day I have come.  Will repeat often!"}
{"text":"Had a Gyro combo with a side salad. Salad was fresh, colorful with a bountiful mix of different vegetables. Dressing was a bit too much vinegar in it. Gyro was full of meat and just the right amount of tzatziki. Not enough onions or tomato on the Gyro though. Restaurant was clean, bright and Diana was very friendly. You will not be disappointed. I only wish the local Greek restaurants would stop hanging up the same Kronos posters. They look cheesy and dated."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving some Greek food but did not want to go too far out of the way from our home. George's food is definitely worth the drive. I had the chicken platter, which was filling and worth the price. My boyfriend had the steak gyro and loved it as well. We will definitely be going back for more in the near future and expect to make this part of our weekly routine!"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I go crazy for this place! The Gyro Picado is my favorite, and the fries with extra seasoning make my mouth water. The Greek salad is also delicious. The downside is they close early in the afternoon on Saturdays and are closed Sunday's, this makes no sense because this place is delicious and would have much bigger business if they were open for us during normal hours."}
{"text":"I tried George's for the first time tonight and absolutely loved it! Both the chicken Caesar pita and the chicken caprese pita were delicious and more than enough food for dinner. The side salad with the Greek dressing was also very good. This place is definitely going into the rotation and I'm looking forward to trying the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The full 5 stars!  And they well deserve it.  My first visit to George's, my daughter and I  were having a hard time reading the menu from where we were sitting, we couldn't leave the table because it was busy and we lose our space..  This amazing man saw what was happening and came all the way from behind the counter with printed menus  so we could   order.. Talk about customer service,  that was beyond any expectations!
The menu is loaded with the usual things you would find at a Greek restaurant but to my surprise it was loaded with much, much more.  And most anything you order comes with either perfectly done french fries or a Greek salad which was the best I've ever had.  The food is obviously made from scratch.  The amazing thing is that each thing was good,  not just a really good Gyro and some mediocre fries.  We ordered an Italian Gyro and a Falafel Pita.  Both quite wonderfully made.  Next time I'm going with a larger group so we can order everything and split it amongst all of us. 
Well now you know the food is good,  the restaurant itself was spotless and anytime someone left the table it was cleaned up before they hit the front door.    
Great food at a good price in an immaculately clean restaurant , what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"The hummus plate was delicious. Very friendly staff and order was hot and ready when I walked in 10 minutes after ordering."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb...the food is awesome. Service is great and everything is always on point. Gyro platter enough for 2 people and pita pizza are pretty good."}
{"text":"Good food at a great price. I usually get the gyro platter. The small Greek salad that it comes with is large enough for my wife to take to work for lunch. Much more than one person should eat for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food, people and price.  Authentic Greek food, no wanna be.  Will go back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Great place and excellent service. George, the owner, and his staff go above and beyond to make your visit enjoyable. The food is awesome and the dining area, beautifully clean. 

Highly recommended, prices are also spot on. You won't break the bank here. Try it, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"I am OBSESSED with this place. The food is amazing - I get the Greek salad with chicken and it's always a huge portion. The chicken is cut into really thin strips and always juicy. I've gotten salmon and gyro meat on my salad too and have loved it. 
Their pasta bolognese is my favorite of their pastas - it comes with meat sauce, prosciutto, and all kinds of deliciousness mixed into one. Tons of flavor.
The employees are always friendly and the food comes out fast even when it's busy. Such a great lunch spot if you work in the area.
I could die eating the tiramisu from here. It's my favorite of all time. I also like the plain cheesecake.
They are open until 8pm during the week, closes  early on Saturdays at 3pm, closed Sundays. 
Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I thought it was delicious! I got the classic gyro, and a salad. Salad was good, and the gyro was awesome. I also got a side of tzatziki sauce for free. The gyro had tons of meat, and it filled me right up! George seems like a cool dude, and if I'm ever in that part of the valley, I will try to come again!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times because I used to work in the same complex. In my opinion you get a really good gyro and very great amount for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Grosse, and rude owner. This is not Greek food. Horribly dirty restaurant, disgusting. It fits the area."}
{"text":"I can not say enough good things about this place. I come from Denver and anyone who has ever been in the vicinity of the Denver Zoo is familiar with Pete's Kitchen. Hands down the best greek food I have ever put in my mouth. That is to say until George came into my life. 
Walking into this place the vibe is laid back and relaxed. The staff is super friendly and it is very clean. I always order the same thing when trying a new Greek place for the first time. I do this because there are certain elements that need to come correct in order to maintain my loyalty. As I have stated in previous reviews I am a one dish wonder. I don't crave restaurants, I crave specific flavors, specific dishes. If I'm eating Greek I want Dolmas and a gyro platter. Occasionally I branch out and have chicken with my gyro, but gyro is going into this mouth!!!  I don't know how he does it, but somehow George manages to infuse the luscious flavor of butter into his Gyro meat. A+ off the bat. Another reason I get the platter is because it comes with a Greek salad, now I'm no health nut, but the combination of pepperoncinis, feta cheese and tangy over the top herbal dressing is necessary to cut through The richness of the gyro meat. George offers a choice of rice or French Fries (I'm a sucker for fries, so I have no opinion about the rice other then it looks to be fragrant with saffron and fluffy). The Tzatziki sauce is on point. It's rich, creamy and has texture. This sauce could never be confused with ranch like it is in so many other disappointing places I have come across since Rotana's closed it's doors. And, now onto the Dolmas. I understand that stuffed grape leaves may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I crave them in my sleep. These are tender of leaf, but the rice has nice texture, not mushy or crumbly. The notes of lemon and dill are perfectly complimented by the tang of the grape leaves and the salt balance is perfect. What I love about Dolmas is the versatility. They are equally delicious dipped in creamy tzatziki as in tangy Greek dressing. Even naked they are addictive. The only complaint I could possibly have is not so much a complaint as a compliment. The chicken is tender and juicy, though cut a bit thin. The only real problem with the chicken is it's not gyro. George has hammered the gyro home so hard with thin sliced red onion and caramelized perfection no chicken would stand a chance!!! Needless to say, I'm hooked, and the table by the fountain drinks is going to be my Gyro sanctuary."}
{"text":"I did not personally order from here, but I was with my friend who did! 
First off, inside was super clean with upbeat music. The employees were friendly and with smiles even for being lunch-hour busy. Their decorations were fun and organized! 
Prices are reasonable and the food looked and smelled delicious! 
He got the original Gyro with fries, which was Devine. The menu has a wide variety of options, not just your typical gyro menu. 
10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food- totally agree with the previous review: bomb ass gyros!!!!  Greek salad was perfect side for the traditional gyro.  Kids hot fries, they were good, too.  Refills on fountain sodas.  They also have bottled beverages.  The only thing I would have to disagree with is the price.  4 people + gyros and side salads (1 French fry) = $45.  I would give it a $$ for price.  GREAT food!!"}
{"text":"My first visit was earlier this week and I have to say it was pretty good, very reasonably priced too. I got the platter with gyro meat and it was honestly more food than I could eat, but I had leftovers for the next day, which was nice. The platter comes with choice of meat, pitas (which I opted to forego being GF) tomatoes and red onions, along with a salad and fries. The salad was kind of a typical Greek type salad, greens with a couple of cucumber slices, kalamata olives, tomatoes, couple peppers, red onion, a dabble of cheese with a vinegar based dressing. The meat was really delish as was the Tzatziki sauce. The fries were fresh and tasty. Overall, it was a good value for the money. It's also a short drive from work so I think I will include it in my regular lunch-time rotation."}
{"text":"First time going there and was awesome! My husband and I both had a gyro salad. Probably the best one I have ever had. Great food and great service, they were very friendly. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Damn good! Yelp referred me to this place when I was just looking for something nearby to take home for dinner. It's in a Corporate Park so I think they are geared more towards the corporate lunch crowd. But one of the best gyros I've ever had! And I have had my fair share of Street cart gryos. Just great flavors, great pita bread, good selection of meat, and good sauce. Overall friendly service and pretty good price! $8 for the gyro and Fries. I will definitely try again!"}
{"text":"The staff here was very friendly, and the food was good! You get a lot of food, but it is a bit pricey for lunch."}
{"text":"Great gyro.  Really good tzatziki sauce.  Friendly service.  I will be back soon to try some other stuff on their expansive menu."}
{"text":"3.5
Didnt even know about this place, but had to pick up a pizza at Pizza Hut next door on a holiday since my work address doesnt have a manned lobby for the deilvery guy to deliver,, 

Anyways, Tried the PICADO Gyro,
the Breading was really good, didnt break apart like other places,
The meat (a whole lotta meat too) was consitantly seasoned, and the fixins, were not overpowering. 
Close to work, and decently priced I will definitly be back.

Even the fries were good...."}
{"text":"Love georges, hidden gem located next to Pizza Hut and fedex. You won't be disappointed,  the pasta dishes are excellent along with his assorted gyros and pitas. My pita plate was enough for two, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Discovered this place in 2010; continue to go back frequently! The mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce is ahmazing. I'm pretty sure I would drink the dressing that goes on the salads. I typically just get an original gyro with fries, but ventured out recently and got the chicken alfredo. Both are super flavorful. Please go try this place, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Big portions for not too bad of costs. One of the regular lunch rotation spots for us. The gyro and all of the fixings it comes with, are very fresh and flavorful. The gyro comes with minimal tzatziki (although very very good) so ask for a side of it. Also recommend the fries for your side. They are crispy on the outside, but not burnt at all, and nice, soft and warm in the inside. One of the best Greek places in Phoenix that I have tried."}
{"text":"Extra star given due to surprising hospitality~

Good food, good prices, good value for both.
Had a Greek Spaghetti and a bottle o' Sprite.
It was interesting to see how busied the staff were in the back, yet how personable and attentive the same people were once they served you your food. A nice balance of speed & seriousness with caring 'slowness' (no rushing in serving you that they'd forget something). To think that they kept this up despite the rush hour of bustling customers.

Honestly, all this would automatically give them 5 stars under my book since it's such a rare combination of positive traits for a fairly-known (at least for the locals) place... but I had planned to reduce it by one star... Because I keep seeing this place being advertised as \"Mediterranean\" - even though I hardly see anything on the menu that's specifically Mediterranean. If there was, it was completely obscured by the specifically-Greek choices. A bit of a bad advertising.

What kept it from losing its 5th star is the fact that I had forgotten my bag in there when I left... it had many expensive items inside, including my tablet. But thanks to the kindness of a customer and the accomodation of the owner, my bag was placed on an easy-to-spot chair behind their counter.
I've known some restaurants where such kind considerations would be rare... and even if those are just *some*, I still appreciate it in a restaurant.

5 Stars!"}
{"text":"This was a decent gyro.  Not as good as King Gyros, but it's a decent backup since this place is closer to my house.  People who work here were friendly too and that helps.  I got the chicken pita and the meat was good.  It was grilled, and not on that cool circle thing they have (I don't know the name, but it makes the meat really good).  Still, it was pretty good.  I only wish I had got extra Tzaski (sp?) sauce to go with it.  I will probably be back here.  FYI- this place is a bit hard to find.  It's basically behind the Pizza Hut.  If you see the signs for the Pizza Hut, you're there.  Park and go on foot from there."}
{"text":"The food here is really good! If you enjoy Gyros and Gyros done right,  George's is super for that ! Usually the owner is there and he is working and cooking on his own and he makes it spectacular. 

Location : Small sit down area, nothing fancy, good for lunch, do not bring a date! You can usually call ahead for take out. 

Prices are about the same as similar places nearby. 

It would be even better if they had special deals like many other gyros places do. For example a meal deal for a special price during lunch, etc."}
{"text":"I love George's. That chicken caesar pita is super yummy. Everyone is always so friendly."}
{"text":"First off.....  One thing: if you ask for more tzaziki sauce, they are happy to give it to you. Just gotta ask!! And, it has lots more flavor than some other  tzaziki I have had.

Now for the review:  Great place!!! The food is very good. Large portions in the gyros as others have said.  There are many pasta dishes on the menu that sound really good. I will update when I try them.

Ted, the owner, is a super friendly, happy guy. The place is right next door to the Fedex. Kind of hidden away, but search and you will be happy you did!

UPDATE.......................................................

I have had a few of the pasta dishes (Greek Pasta and Meat pasta). Tthey are great! They come with garlic bread AND a Medium sized salad! A great meal for approx 7-8 bucks!!"}
{"text":"Great place! The guys working there give great service. The food was delicious. 

Whenever I visit a place for the first time, I ask what's the best item on the menu. The Original Gyro Sandwich was the recommendation  and that's what I had. It was a HUGE gyro! I was so full I had to skip dessert (oh, the humanity).

There are several other items on their menu I want to try, so I'll be back."}
{"text":"Gyros are the best I've ever had and their Greek Spaghettis are to die for. Great lunch spot and ideal for take out. Prices are reasonable and quality is on par with pricing."}
{"text":"have been trying the pasta dishes and rice meat combo---now I am up to 4 stars...prices are cheap and the food good...."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a place with really good gyros, and George's is the best in town.  They get the best quality meat, and cook it to perfection, with generous portions.  My mouth is watering now just thinking about the next time I'll head there!"}
{"text":"Came here on my lunch, hag the original with fries.. Fresh and tasty. Great portion. I took it to go but it's clean and friendly staff. I'd go back."}
{"text":"George serves up amazing Greek food. I order the gyro pita every time. 

Wish they had more seating, but this place is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Located in an industrial park off the 101 and I-17, this place is a perfect spot to grab some lunch. My family stopped in shortly before dinner. We were greeted immediately by a happy man who was just as cute as a button and very helpful.

I was impressed with the expansive menu, but nonetheless, went with my standard gyro and Greek salad. Husband had the Italian gyro and son had the standard gyro as well. I was happy with my selection. The meat is sliced very thin and piled high and the bread to tzatziki to meat proportions were perfect in my opinion. My salad was great, and I found myself stealing crispy fries from my son's plate as well. 

My 10 year old son did not finish his gyro, but wrapped it up to take home for later. This is rare for him, so he obviously enjoyed it as much as we did.  I will make it back in soon to try the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious!!! & the staff was so nice!!!! The older gentleman was so sweet and made sure we were comfortable and enjoying our food/environment! Great prices for their food & their decor made you feel like you were eating Gyros in Greece! Definitely recommend!!!"}
