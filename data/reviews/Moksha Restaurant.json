{"text":"Tried this new place out, right beside my home.

First impression, quiet. It was a Saturday night and there was no one else in the restaurant when we arrived around 8pm. 

We got seated and set with our menus right away. We ordered 3 dishes for my boyfriend and I ; butter chicken, bhindi masala (okra) and chicken marsala with 2 orders of naan and some white rice. Price was $50 inc. tax.

Service was fine, attentive at best. 

Will return."}

{"text":"The only thing worse than the food in this restaurant is the service.  And the service is trumped by rude management.  Will definitely not return to this restaurant.  There are too many good restaurants in Toronto to settle for sub par food and service in this restaurant.  Hope this is helpful for all looking for a good Indian meal in Toronto."}
