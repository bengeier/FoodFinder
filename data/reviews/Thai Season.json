{"text":"I had the spicy fried rice with chicken and crab puffs. Sister had the spicy noodles with  tofu. Both dishes were AWESOME, crab puffs didn't really have any flavor but were okay! I loved the atmosphere in there and everyone was very friendly! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Love this place, I was uncertain at first with the new menu and new owners but the food is still exceptional."}
{"text":"I had pad prik khing today soooooo good. Recomment you come to try this restaurant. They just open..."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday to order take out from Thai Basil. I went in and discovered that the name/ownership changed. I ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai for my husband and me and decided to try the Crab Puffs (I think that's what they were called on their appetizers menu). Definitely was not disappointed. Best Pad Thai I've had! Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Happened to find this gem on Yelp and was skeptical as there were only a few reviews. However, we learned that they had recently opened so thought we would give it a try.  I am so glad we did!    We are vegan and they were very accommodating to make our food vegan.  Everything we tried was outstanding!    The owner came over to ask if we liked everything and I said to him, \"This is the 2nd best Thai food I've had in the Phoenix area.  The first is a little house that seats about 10 on Broadway in Phoenix\" and before I could finish he said \"Chan Pen?\" and I said \"That's it!\" and he replies, \"My aunty owns that.  She taught me to cook\".  Well no wonder I liked Thai Season - that explains everything."}
{"text":"Went to Thai season with my bf for lunch, had the garlic pepper chicken and pad Thai, both were very very good.  We decided to visit again for dinner tonight, we had the Thai BBQ chicken and drunken noodles. The chicken was delicious, crispy on the outside moist on the inside. And the drunken noodles were some of the best we've had.  As we ate dinner the owner was nice enough to stop and talk with us. He's very kind and humble. We will definitely be coming back with great regularity."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.   We thought we would try Thai Basil, but it changed ownership. Cannot compare to old as we had not been previously.   My red curry was great. I ordered medium hotness, and it did not lack spice. My wife had drunken noodle...which was even better.   Small place, located in a nondescript strip mall. Quiet atmosphere, clean. Family owned and operated. I'd recommend a stop if you are craving good Thai food."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and spot on flavorwise.  Definitely will be back. Fast service.  Price is correct for the quality"}
{"text":"Saturday at 5:00 pm. Doesn't answer the phone and then I drive over and they are closed even though their hours say they are supposed to be open. No sign or notice to explain why."}
{"text":"Delivery with no plasticware, chopsticks, napkins, plates, nothing. Called to ask why and they say they forgot we were in a hotel with nothing to eat with???? No offer to come back (they are a mile away), no offer to credit anything back, give our $5 tip back, etc. Lame.  Also, the soup is ok but the Pad Thai tastes old (stale noodles) and nothing like Pad Thai and the meat in it is smells gamey and is chewy....obviously old and thawed. Ripoff.  Edit: This just in: 20 minutes later and I am officially sick from the Pad Thai. Please be careful with this place. Something is just not right at all."}
{"text":"Just sat down to eat and my date went to the restroom and and saw cockroaches half alive on the floor in the hall by the kitchen. Didn't eat. We couldn't stomach it. Very disappointed !"}
