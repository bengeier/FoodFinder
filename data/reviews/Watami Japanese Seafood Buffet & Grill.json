{"text":"This place is wonderful, ate there two days in a row and will definitely go back.  Over forty different kinds of sushi and sashimi.  14.99 for the dinner buffet and 8.99 for lunch.  They also have regular Japanese food for those that don't like sushi.  Awesome place."}
{"text":"This place has ruined sushi for me.  I'll see even good sushi at the grocery store for $10 but I'll think \"I could go to Watami and eat myself sick on sushi for just a few bucks more\".  Although inexpensive, I think that their sushi is top flight and can certainly hold it's own against higher end establishments.  I'll deduct one star though for what is a half hearted attempt to provide luke warm, non-sushi alternatives; but if you don't care about that then feel free to ignore that caveat."}
{"text":"This place should be shut down by the health department. The food was cold, tasted rotten and they still made us pay for it even though we didn't get past the first bite. Not sure what employees are posting nice reviews but this isn't a 3.5 star place unless the scale is from 1 to 100. Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"Well first off, the address was wrong or GPS coordinates because the directions were way off. Secondly there was a good selection of sushi available, however I was afraid to touch it cuz it didn't look healthy. I feel that the Yelpers misled me this time. I walked in, looked at Buffett then left."}
{"text":"Love this place frash cheap and plentiful. The help is very nice and helpful"}
{"text":"A lot of restaurants in this style have sub-quality Sushi.  This is definitely not the case at Watami.  All the sushi is prepared right in front of your eyes and it seriously tastes just as good as Sushi Rock.  I don't know how they offer high quality sushi on a buffet with tons of other food on the buffet that you would find at a high end Chinese restaurant for such a good price.  I had to talk quite a few people into coming to this place because most people think just because it's in a Parma shopping plaza that it's just going to be like any other buffet.  All the people I've taken here leave with a \"Wow\" expression on how awesome this place is!  Definitely a hidden gem in Parma.  The lunch buffet is only $9!  To choose from over 15 types of sushi on a top of 20-30 other menu items on the buffet including green tea icecream this is one of the best things about Parma (and I know that doesn't say much, but this place is seriously good, hands down!\""}
{"text":"Its not the best quality or best selection of sushi you going to get. However, if you just want quantity this is the place. Prices reflect the quality. Hot foods are a mixed of chinese and japanese cuisines. I didn't find the hot food too appearing. I usually stick with the salad and sushi."}
{"text":"I was scared of sushi after having a bad experience with it when I was younger, and I gave anyone dirty looks and wanted to hurl when they would tell me they liked it. So when my boyfriend suggested we try this place I was weary, to say the least. But I instantly fell in love with this place. They have a large variety of japanese salads, sushi, hot dishes, and desserts.   We probably frequent this place at least once a week. The sushi  makers know us by now and always make us fresh tuna avacado rolls and mexican rolls.   I'm not a big fan of the hot side, I occassionally have a little of the chicken and mushrooms. Some of the food looks like it's been sitting out for awhile, unless you're there for lunch. Then everything is always really fresh.   I've never tried any of the salads that they have, I feel like you have to be a hardcore Japanese lover to enjoy it. But I don't mind, I come for the sushi anyway.   If some of the sushi looks older, the guys behind the bar will gladly make you a fresh made-to-order roll, and they are super fast! I always come here for sushi when I'm running tight on money and have a craving. Dinner runs about $15 for the buffet. And the lunch buffet (which includes everything except watami rolls) is about $8. Not bad at all.   It's not the fanciest place on the planet, and they don't try to be. But this place converted me to becoming a sushi fanatic and I am a customer for life!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites.  I had my first ever piece of sushi here- and now I'm hooked!  I love the buffet style because, let's be honest, when it comes to sushi a can eat A LOT.  So I always get my money's worth.  The sushi is always served at a good temperature, and while the seafood in it may be scarce- I like it that way.  The honey chicken is also good!  Avoid the potstickers.  I tried to like them the first few times- and I just can't.  There is also 1 sushi roll i don't like: the \"rock 'n roll\".  It tastes like bad fish to me.    I come to Watami weekly for late lunch since it's cheaper and it is no different than dinner."}
{"text":"I'm a weekly regular for lunch at this place.  It is without a doubt the best sushi value in Cleveland.Their dinners are good too but the lunch has the best bang for your buck.  Hard to go wrong with mackerel sushi on a lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I'm sad to write this negative review as I've happily gone to Watami for years, however this last visit cemented my observations that this place has been going downhill recently.  Went today with a friend for dinner and found a large piece of plastic wrapped into one of the maki roll pieces!  Additionally, the fish looked and tasted like it had been sitting out all day and was just...off.  I was really disappointed since I used to be a diehard Watami fan (I was only 3 meals away from a free one with their punch card), but I'll probably just go to Kumo's from now on.    The price is unbeatable when it's a busy day and everything is fresh, but they really need to pay more attention to serving their customers safe and fresh food on off days, too."}
{"text":"You can't beat a sushi buffet. I don't even pay attention to the more traditional side.  I've been there five times in the last two years after my mom took me there for my birthday. I'd be there more often but living 40 minutes away, I'll eat there any time I'm in the Parma area."}
{"text":"Wow, much better than you would expect. There is great variety and everything is tasty.  Yes, it is not as great of cuts as a real nice sitdown Japanese restaurant but that is not what it is.  Cheap and good. And this is coming from someone who used to live in Japan."}
{"text":"Okay, so most people cringe when they hear the words: sushi, buffet, and parma in one sentence; but the purpose of THIS review is to dispel ideas one may have about Watami's quality.  The sushi at the bar is of good quality (better than sushi you'd get a grocery store, and better than many other buffets that serve sushi) -- you will not get sick from their fish.  I go there at least a couple times a month (for many yeara), and never once have I experienced food-related illness -- but pizza, or Double dragon buffet makes me barf really easily, to put that into perspective.  Sometimes, the hot food bar is mediocre (I usually skip it), and sometimes the fried items get dry -- such is the nature of a buffet, but the sushi is a-okay and never dry or weird.  Take your friends here and sample the many interesting foods available, such as seaweed salad, flying fish roe, green tea ice cream,  kimchi, and more!  It's pretty delicious!  Take out is also ridiculously CHEAP-- Me and my boyfriend can chow down til we're full for about $16 total at the takeout prices.  The staff is mostly friendly."}
{"text":"Normally, I would say \"RUN!\" when you hear the words \"sushi, buffet, and Parma\" in the same sentence. Actually, I would normally say \"RUN!\" with either one of those words put together. However, my dad had read a decent review of this place in the Plain Dealer so he convinced me to give it a shot on my lunch break. I was very, very happy with our lunch. We have actually gone back a couple of times. It is worth the trip to Parma, and it is clean and the staff is friendly. Also, I normally find buffets depressing because I feel like I am just watching people gorge themselves to death, but I didn't get that vibe here at all."}
{"text":"I have eaten there several times with family. I like Yellow Tail better than Watami."}
{"text":"As a self-proclaimed buffet connoisseur and Cleveland native, I can unhesitantly declare Watami the best buffet in the city. The venue itself is spotless, bright, and modernly decorated with some hints of traditional Japanese added throughout. Their sushi variety is vast and will satisfy many different palates. You have your pick from sashimi, nigiri, maki, temaki, and futomaki, to your more familiar Western options like California. Please note that the aforementioned is not a complete list, as they have plenty more. And like any other sushi buffet, some rolls will sit out if the place isn't busy, but honestly, I had no complaints about any of the rolls that I ate. The sushi chefs are very skilled and received some extra bonus points from me for putting out multiple rolls that were fried or had fried fillings--those are my absolute favorite!   The superb quality of the hot food station is often overlooked, in my opinion. This is probably due to people filling up their tummies with so much delicious sushi to the point of not having much room or appetite for anything else. I'm a big eater so it would be very laborious for me to review every single thing that I ate. Instead, I'll list for you (in no particular order) what I consider most memorable: 1.) a scoop of fried rice, cabbage, and chicken teriyaki (each served separately) 2.) grilled shrimp skewers 3.) crab rangoon 4.) honey chicken 5.) shrimp tempura 6.) general tso's chicken 7) fried donuts and 8.) sweet bean paste-filled dough balls rolled in sesame seeds. Take my word for it: the food, especially for costing only $12.99 (dinner), is unbelievable and you will surely be disappointed that you didn't have a second stomach to funnel more in to.  Now, after giving Watami my stamp of approval, you're probably wondering why I rated it 4/5 and not 5/5. It's sad to say that the manager/hostess/owner(?) made me and my friend feel just a tad uncomfortable. Every 10 minutes or so, she would walk up and down the aisle between the tables and conspicuously peak her head over us to examine our plates. I'm not sure if she was trying to keep tabs on how much we were eating (it's a buffet for God's sake) or which foods we didn't like or touch, but it was kind of unwelcoming and rude. I noticed that she was doing it to others, too, although it doesn't justify it, so we simply ignored it, had a great chat, and enjoyed our heavenly chow. Give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I guess I had beginners luck with this place.  I took a group of 13 friends there and I left horribly ashamed that I'd done so.  My sushi wasn't as good this time around but what was worse was the desserts.  Two different desserts had mold growing on them!  The cheesecake and some other cream cheese dessert had mold on each of them.  We stuck to the ice cream.  Given my experience, I don't know that I'll be back again..."}
{"text":"Yelp lead us to this awesome sushi buffet!  When you think of strip mall sushi... you are bound to also think of an assortment of horrible complications from eating it.  But alas - Watami to the rescue!  The wide variety of sushi and assortment of Chinese dishes is truly remarkable for the price.  I have been here countless times, but only for lunch... and one thing we learned - the food is better if you go close to opening.    I'd skip the dessert bar... it's all mediocre.  And you probably don't want to use the restroom (it's a little gross).    However... we did notice the family who owns and runs the restaurant actually serving themselves from the buffet and sitting down to eat.  This made us feel much more comfortable about Watami!  If you keep your expectations reasonable - you will be happy.  This will never be \"the best thing\" you've ever eaten... but it can definitely be a pleasant and satisfying experience!"}
{"text":"While Kumo down the road may have a broader selection of asian food, Watami provides a smaller, more focused buffet with select higher-quality offerings, particularly sushi.  A decent selection of nigiri and rolls, as well as hot entrees, are available (take-out also available on a per-pound basis).  Have been for lunch several times and the buffet is consistently rotated during the lunch rush.  Lunch pricing of $8.49 is very reasonable for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Tucked away in Parmatown Plaza, Watami is a combination sushi/hibachi/buffet restaurant.  It is one of our favorite restaurants, and we have enjoyed consistently fresh, delicious sushi, sashimi, salads and cooked items.  The sushi offerings consist of simple, standard rolls (California, Spicy Tuna, etc.) along with several larger Futomaki rolls.  Sashimi is also available, with choices including salmon, tuna and yellowtail.  Cold seafood selections consist of peel-n-eat shrimp, mussels and langostinos.  An assortment of cold salads is also offered,  featuring kimchi, seaweed salad, and marinated mushrooms, along with edamame and tofu.    Watami also offers numerous hot entrees, typical of other Asian buffets, including honey chicken, sweet/sour pork, beef with broccoli, egg rolls, and assorted tempura-battered vegetables and seafood.  Hibachi preparation is also available upon request.  This restaurant offers a clean, relatively quiet atmosphere, along with attentive and friendly service.  A resonably-priced dining option for sushi lovers."}
{"text":"this is not your typical all-you-can-eat style food restaurant. their food is a few levels higher than you're find at those other places, and the best thing about this place is they refresh the food often, unlike other places who leave the popular food items empty for long periods of time. You're going to find quality food here and lots of it for a very reasonable price. Right now you can get all the food you can eat for lunch for $7.99, now I ask you, how do you beat that price for quality food? You don't is the correct answer, so make sure you get over and visit this place when you've got a taste for some really good Japanese food, and even if you don't take advantage of the all-you-can-eat aspect, you're going to pay less than you would in a regular Japanese restaurant and still get the same quality of food."}
{"text":"OK, maybe I'm one of \"those people\" the other reviewer referred to. I did live in LA for 11 years, but for the record,  I moved back because I love Cleveland and the food scene here is great.  But this place is not great sushi. At best it's fast food sushi. But like some others mentioned, some of the fish seems dry, like it's been sitting out for awhile. The Chinese food side is really solid Chinese takeout type stuff. It just seemed kind of carelessly put together. Like the egg drop soup had plastic wrap melted into it.  A big highlight was the green beans. Weird, I know, but they were great. And like any buffet it was fun to have a big variety to choose from. Also the server was very attentive. They have beer, and you can bring your own wine in."}
{"text":"So sad to see this place taken over by a Jimmy Johns! This was a good place to eat. Now off to Kumo!"}
{"text":"A matter of great interest to me is why some reviewers, whether local or visitors, believe they are worldly by insulting most things Cleveland. A bad restaurant is labeled as what more can be expected in this town. Any good restaurant the reviewer finds too good to be here. Now let me inform this group that insulting a place is far from sophisticated. We live here because we do not want to live where you come from and we prefer our own style of food.   A few writers in particular irk me so much that I go to places they insult as it is near a sure thing I will enjoy them. My friend called today to say she was meeting her sister at Watami for dinner and invited me to join.  I checked yelp and sure enough I found a bad review from one of those who slight things Cleveland. I drove thru heavy rains in peak traffic to get to Parma.  I found a brightly lit, very clean dining room. Fresh trays of everything were continually replacing those quickly depleted by young families with infants, middle aged couples, Asians, whites, blacks, and seniors. I am not a sushi fan but I filled my plate twice with sushi, beautiful salads, fresh shrimp and tempura. The servers were friendly and attentive. In a short time my small group was chatting with those at nearby tables. You know what? We had a typical Cleveland evening where no one was whining that we were not in LA or Houston or NYC."}
{"text":"Great place for the price. Don't expect to get real fancy sushi, most of it is imitation crabmeat, but thats what you get for $10 a head. The chicken teriyaki is mazing, so are their pot stickers. One thing that disappointed me was that I went to use the bathroom and noticed a broom closet door was open and there was a bed in there. Someone was living in there, I just hope it wash the nice lady/server. They have a gig screen tv and you can sit and watch the news during dinner if you choose."}
{"text":"I liked it!!!!!  We got there maybe a little later than normal and the food wasn't SUPER fresh but still pretty freaken tasty! I can eat so they probably didn't see much in the way of profit when I came through the buffet line like a tornado!!!! I don't do buffets a lot because I'd probably weigh like 300 lbs so I keep them to a minimum and that may be something to think about as my buffet experience is like maybe 3 a year so... Go and let me know what 'cha think! Cheers!!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place. It's fast, friendly, clean and the food is really good! Not only that it's a very reasonable price for everything they offer."}
{"text":"1st timer here, walked in and said I wanted sushi to go... I was given a box and pointed towards the sushi buffet! I'm not a buffet fan (Jimmy yes, but I don't want my sushi to be sitting out for hours)  I was totally impressed with the cleanliness and the looks of the inside so I proceeded. The great thing is, you can try a couple pieces of this and that without committing to an entire roll, and they charge by the pound so you aren't paying 13 bucks for a roll you might not even like. I hate to admit, but I was expecting mediocre at best, but the sushi actually was some of the better sushi I've had recently! My stuffed box only cost 11 bucks and they gave me a free pop. Most importantly my husband liked everything I brought home and found it to be fresh and tasty. They even had rolls we haven't seen before like peanut rolls! No more over priced sushi for us. I hope they keep the quality up because we will return often.   The only sad part, was the 2 sushi chefs couldn't make the rolls fast enough! They could use another 2 sushi artists, as it goes fast. I think this would be a great place to take someone who likes hibachi and might want to try sushi. They have a hot buffet too and that food looked very good too, I was tempted."}
{"text":"This place keeps getting better. Parma and sushi sounds like a recipe for a date with the porcelain god. But the sushi is quite good. They also have kimchi and seaweed salad. The salad dressing is the bomb. I don't really eat the cooked buffet foods except for the snow crab. I'm afraid to try the raw oysters but I have seen people eat them. The thing with sushi is that you're full but you dont get that engorged depressed buffet hangover. This place should be located on the east side. I'm pretty sure the students from Case would demolish this place. The drive to parma is stiff but worth it if you have time. The best buffet in Cleveland hands down."}
{"text":"Of the three sushi buffets in the Cleveland area that I'm aware of (Kumo, Watami, Yellowtail), this one has the best quality sushi. Granted, you're better off coming here on weekends or whenever it's busy so that the sushi stays fresh.  Also, they don't have as big of a sushi selection as the others, but the rolls they do offer are well made and taste good.  They even offer the spider roll (soft shell crab).  They have the best sashimi as well.  The hot food side is lacking in variety and is generally nothing to write home about, but the shrimp tempura and the veggie tempura here beats out the competition. The fried rice is better here too.  Used to frequent this place almost on a weekly basis, and the service is very friendly and helpful.  They treat returning customers very well too, sometimes with specially prepared dishes.  My mom can't eat seafood, so they prepare a special fish dish for her. One of the sushi chefs saw me grabbing a spider roll, he stops me and gives me a giant chunk of softshell crab.  Score.  I would normally rate this 3 stars, but they get more points for their excellent customer service.  Since Kumo opened, I haven't been back, but that's not to take anything away from Watami, which still holds its own."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! It has what you would expect from a buffett, plus their sushi selections.  It's gorgeous, well-lit, and not tacky-looking.  The service has been good every visit (10+) and the people working there are super nice!"}
{"text":"I hope this place reopens at in a  different location because it was my favorite!!!!! It was a sad day when it closed :("}
{"text":"Great sushi, fresh and delicious. Hot buffet is very good as well. Desserts suck, but I don't go to Japanese restaurants for their cheesecake. Lunch buffet is a deal!"}
{"text":"I've gone back a few times over the past year since I first reviewed Watami. It's not so good anymore. I feel like the veggie sushi is rolled around where the fish was laying (or made with the same gloves that handled fish). It just tastes fishy. Probably not going back."}
{"text":"I went to pick up a friend and got caught in traffic due to president Obama being nearby for a speech. Found a strip mall with chipotle, a Chinese place, and this Japanese buffet. Yeah, it was just about empty at 8:30 on a Thursday night. The sushi looked kind of.. tired.. and the hot section's offering looked kind of mummified. Despite all that, I was able to find things that looked and tasted pretty good, and didn't feel like I got ripped off. Would I come back? Perhaps if it was busy, or I wanted to take a bunch of 13 year olds out for a birthday dinner. The place is nice and clean, and has all you can eat ice cream."}
{"text":"I love sushi, but my husband doesn't... this was a great place to go because there were so many options. I pigged out on the sushi, while my husband ate the orange, general tso, egg rolls etc.   They have great green tea ice cream for a sweet ending to the meal :)"}
{"text":"Wow, I don't even know where to start. Yesterday I had a craving for a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Since I was around my Mommy's house in parma I went picked her up and we went to Watami.    Lunch is like around $8 or $9 and may I remind you that this is a buffet in a strip mall of parma (.like \"Angry B.\" said in previous review). I was pretty excited since I been there only once before and they were very busy so everything was fresh and very good. However! After yesterday I don't think I'll be planning to come back there for sushi ever again.      The buffet of teriyaki chicken and beef and other things very pretty good, but sushi was disappointing to me. They didn't have any sashimi and the rice was really really dry and kind of tasteless. I had to take a sip of my lemon water couple times to make it go down. The fish on the rice was paper thin and probably could of read reviews from yelp on my phone through it."}
{"text":"This is a real Japanese buffet with sushi, but this restaurant does not get enough business.  I came here on a Saturday night, at 7:00 pm.  Not sure if people just have better things to do on a Saturday night, but I almost wanted to turn around and walk out the door.  In the whole restaurant, there was one other table of people.  More customers did not walk in the door until about 8.    Because of this, the food sits at the buffet, becoming cold and unappealing.  I actually spit out some of the food for that very reason.  We were there until 8:30 pm, and not once did they change out the frog legs.  I know, I was watching it.  Sushi did not taste fresh either.  In fact, some of it tasted frozen.    What a pity."}
{"text":"My friend treated me here for my early birthday celebration! ~~ They have a new item fried scallops, so chic! They did not have eel sushi this afternoon. We had a good time, I still prefer this place for budget and selection and taste! I will treat my friend soon!"}
{"text":"It's not the best quality sushi, but you gotta face it, when you pay $15 for all you can eat sushi and sashimi, what do you expect?  They have a wide selection of rolls, and some standard type nigiri sushi (tuna, snapper, salmon, etc).  They had crawfish too on the night we went, crab legs, and raw oyster.  They also have a hot food bar, and hibachi, which I didn't really try except for some veggie tempura.  For dessert, a selection of cakes, ice cream, and fruit.  They don't have much sashimi, and when they run out, you have to ask for them to bring some more back out, otherwise they might not restock it for a long time."}
{"text":"Average quality buffet sushi.  Note that this is in comparison to buffet sushi, not sushi in general.  There's a large variety here.  You can get sashimi, rolls, or nigiri.  The quality of the ingredients is so-so.    The restaurant is large and the tables are set up so that it is easy to accommodate large groups.  Of all the things here, I would say that the teriyaki dishes are the best.  There are huge trays of both chicken teriyaki and beef teriyaki.  Served with vegetables, it's pretty much what you would get at a Japanese fast food restaurant in a mall food court - but all you can eat.  The other hot foods (typical fried food in a Asian buffet) are decent.  For the price (~$12 for dinner), the value is so-so."}
{"text":"Is there EVER a semi-trashy Chinese food place worthy of 5 stars? I mean, what are we comparing to here? If we are comparing apples to apples vs other little Chinese buffets, watami definitely takes the cake. One time-They had cheese puffs on the buffet. Why, yes, I think I might eat some sushi, tofu, crab Rangoon, and cheese puffs! (Seriously). The food is basically like any other place that's similar but they have a great sushi selection for a buffet! Especially for a vegetarian!! They have a few different kinda of vege sushi which is usually unheard of at a buffet! Watami, I salute you."}
{"text":"Cheap sushi, and good too! For 30 pieces of sushi for 12 dollars, you seriously can't go wrong. I love their selection, plus it's way better than store bought sushi being homemade and all. Granted, i've never been to any expensive sushi place...but why bother when it's this good?  They also have a lunch special buffet, all you can eat for around 8-13 dollars. Great deal considering they have a ton of other stuff to eat besides sushi."}
{"text":"SO SAD! The place is closing. Maybe the developer has other plans for the space. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I had the take out buffet the last two evenings.  A nice selection for $4.99/lb with free soda.  Its nice to be able to get the vast selection of a buffet and pay the price of a single take out item (about $7).  I haven't tried the sushi but it looks pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I really like Watami! Definitely the cleanest Japanese buffet I've been to. They offer the usual fare, I'm a sucker for some general Tso's. And then theres this huge sushi selection, which is money. Usually I wouldn't touch sushi at a buffet, but this stuff is good quality, and pretty inventive. The desserts aren't anything exciting, but i'll always end a meal with some green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"Another yelper called this \"fast food sushi\" and that is the perfect way to describe it. It's not the best quality but is tasty and will fix a sushi craving. This would be my choice if I'm dying for sushi on days it isn't half off at tomo, shinto, or Sakura. But mostly my brother just bribes me to go here (free food) because he loves it and it's quick, so I never say no.   They have a lot of sushi rolls to pick from but I usually stick with the basic rolls, just my taste. One side is sushi and the other side is hot food, basic Chinese buffet dishes. It's not the greatest selection so I usually just get some teriyaki chicken then go right back to the sushi side.   Oh and I forgot to mention lunch is only $7.50.... Which is probably why the broski offers to treat."}
{"text":"Watami isn't the fanciest sushi place around, and they don't have the largest selection, but for a buffet I think it's a great place, and I go regularly.  The sushi is flavorful with a nice variety of traditional rolls, some more modern interpretations, and a small selection of sashimi.  The pepper tuna nigiri is one of my favorites, and the quality has been consistently good.  I don't go for the hot food buffet (I have other Chinese restaurants I prefer when I'm in the mood for that) but it's nice to have access to some miso soup or a bit of dim sum, for a little bit of variety.  The salads are always tasty and flavorful.  The seaweed salad is excellent, and there's a lovely marinated mushroom salad and one made with octopus that is quite nice.    Overall, this isn't a fancy night-out-on-the-town sort of place, but it's excellent for a casual sushi dinner or lunch with friends, and I've always experienced good service and tasty, good-quality sushi."}
{"text":"Went for carry-out sushi, yet again, at Watami.  It's above average sushi and I like it.  You can't beat the price.  You can get as much as you want and they simply weigh it.  It costs $7.00 for 15 pieces of sushi.  That's enough to fill me up and then some.  Forget the desserts and the 'other' buffet, I just want sushi.  The sushi is good and the variety is good.    By eating here, I'm not breaking the bank or my belt.  Love it!"}
{"text":"A sushi buffet in Ohio? Whaa? And in Parma? (and where in the world is Parma?!)  After being disappointed that Seoul Garden was closed on Mondays (sheesh!), we headed over to Watami...as it was 1.4 miles away.  We all drove over to Watami, hidden away in a strip mall.  As we were a group of 7, I thought it would be hard to seat us. To our surprise, we were seated right away. The restaurant is quite spacious, with tvs lining one side (where Monday night football was playing).  We all went for the buffet. On one side, there's a sushi bar- multiple types of sushi, sashimi, etcera being made.. with lots of choices.   The other side of the buffet had the hot foods- a tad more unique- fried frog legs, oyster, mussels, various types of fishes, dim sum, your typical fried rice and random noodles, etc.  The grade of the sushi...wasn't the best. I mean, it was definitely cool to have all the choices- kudos to that- but grade.... the rice in the sushi wasn't being held together all that well, and the fish..just wasn't that fresh.  The hot stuff...was your typical asian buffet fried food- it was okay.. but.. not my fave.  I, however, enjoyed the assortment of ice cream. Green tea, vanilla, etc..with random pieces of cake were really good! The rice pudding..not so much.  Not so great. I mean, it was okay? And the company I ate dinner with were good? The food..not so much. However, props to the wait staff- they were fast and efficient. My fellow buffet-arian next to me commented on how he \"liked to see the stacks of plates pile up.. to show how much you eat at a buffet..\" but our plates never stacked up. Props.  So, for a buffet... I mean, it's what you expect for an asian buffet in Ohio. For authentic-ness, not so great..but meh, it was okay."}
{"text":"Ive been going to Watami pretty regularly for years, and it is consistently good. There is a big variety of food, and the atmosphere, while simple and casual, is warm and friendly.    There are always many varieties of fresh maki rolls and sashimi, as well as lots of cold dishes and salads (kimchi, edamame, tofu, seaweed salad) and hot food (tempura vegetables, fried rice, miso soup, hibachi, etc.).  It is very vegetarian-friendly, with at least five different fishless sushi rolls and meatless hot food.    They recently dropped their dinner price to $11.99, and got rid of the crab legs, which I thought was a smart move, to compete with the nearby Kumo Buffet, which is \"fancier\" but is not as vegetarian-friendly, and more seafood-centric (good or bad, depending on who you ask)."}
{"text":"I'm generally opposed to Asian buffets as a category, but after I was brought to Watami, I've returned on my own free will a few more times.  There are a lot of your standard Asian buffet offerings which you'll recognize and may find to be hit-or-miss, but the sushi is pretty good for a buffet.  When I've been there, the rolls are continually being freshly prepared, with a wide variety."}
{"text":"I came here with one of my \"closest roaddogz\" last Friday. Damn Parmatown. In high school you was the man Parmatown! The *bleep* happened to you?!   I didn't know if I was in an episode of Scooby Doo in an abandoned amusement park or a strip mall. Poor old Watami was pretty empty. There was a ton of food sitting out buffet style. Since I hate the idea of waste, I decided to pile as much sushi as I possibly could on my plate. When I eat sushi, I try not to think about what I am doing. I was \"under the influence\" once eating at Pacific East and got a vivid image of a dead fish in my mind's eye. It bugged me out. When I was at Watami, I didn't get any imagery bouncing through my skull, I just felt like, yeah, this tastes like a dead, raw fish."}
{"text":"Let's all be honest here.  It's a buffet, it's cheap, and it's definately more than good enough.  I've taken my last 3 giriflriends here, all sushi snobs, and though they may not rave about it, they all wanted to go back.  The price is right, and the quality better than the price unquestionably. It's FAR better than grocery sushi, and the hot asian dishes aren't half bad.    Considering the market they're targeting, the rediculous amounts of food you can score, and that their carry-out is something like $9 a pound, this is one hell of a bargain."}
{"text":"Much of what has been written about Watami, could be about Watami... on any given day.  You can ALWAYS expect super service, whether it's crowded or not, and you generally will get what you pay for.  This is NOT high-scale sushi, but  you would be better off doing a weigh-out/take out from here versus Giant Eagle!  It's never crowded, but in Watami's defense, the restaurant is pretty large!  I believe I saw it \"highly populated\" once on a Friday night.  We frequent for take-out probably once a month.  Walked in at 11:30 on a weekday, everything was fresh. There is an obvious little \"fish to rice ratio,\" but it's ok for a quick sushi craving fix.   Another plus; They offer a nice variety  of unique/non-fish sushi...  Try the peanut roll or sweet potato!"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical when I heard \"sushi buffet\" but I was ever so pleasantly surprised!!! We went on a thursday evening, and I started with soup and salad. Very fresh and flavorful!! Next, I checked out the sushi rolls. Very inventive and delicious combinations!! The sushi chefs were whipping up fresh batches throughout our visit there, so I felt at ease knowing it was indeed fresh. I also had some of the hot buffet, and it wasn't bad!! Pretty typical spread- sweet and sour chicken, tempura shrimp, veggies, steamed bok choy, fried rice, lo mein, etc. I'm so happy my boyfriend turned me on to this place!! I wish I lived closer, I would definitely be a regular here!"}
