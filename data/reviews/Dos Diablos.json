{"text":"Went to a new restaurant that's right across the street from where we live. Dos Diablos is the name and it's in the location of the former Mancuso's restaurant. The fare is Mexican and they also position themselves as an entertainment/nightlife venue.  My wife and I tried several appetizers including the Jalape√±o poppers and the guacamole. The poppers were large and very good. They were served with a sweet honey chili dipping sauc,e and I would recommend these. The Guac was also good.. The chips could have been hotter, and the red salsa I think could have better. I prefer a chunkier style but the green salsa verde was very flavorful.  I had the Burrito with tenderloin steak and caramelized onions and diablo sauce (rice and beans' incl as standard fare). The Diablo sauce was actually pretty dam good. The burrito was flavorful and pretty standard fare that you can't go wrong with. The refried beans didn't have a lot of flavor but surprisingly the Spanish rice was very good.  My wife had the Chili relleno which was very large and smothered in a pork tip sauce. The sauce could have been a little more flavorful, but it was a very good dish overall.  We had the sopapillas for dessert and they were coated in cinnamon and served with Ducle de leche ice-cream. I would recommend this as it was very good.  We had two margs (patron) and they were not bad. The food was served seconds after the appetizers, but as the place has been opened for only a few days a few kinks kike that are to be expected. The decor has multiple flat screens and two bars.   They seem to be a  little confused in what they want to be: a bar or a restaurant and the bar seems to be winning out. A DJ starts spinning music at 9:00pm. In North Scottsdale there is a mix between young and old and I wonder if this duality will work for them.  All in all if you're in North Scottsdale (way North) Dos Diablos shows great promise as a place where you can catch a game, a good drink, and some decent Mexican food."}
{"text":"Honestly, I know this place is new but they advertised on their coupons and mailers they sent out that they had a happy hour and when I went in to ask about what was on special they said they didn't have a happy hour and would probably start one up later next week.   To me that is false advertising and I will not give the place another chance. You only get one chance to make a first impression.   I also scanned their menu and found it to be one of those menus that doesn't give prices with cents. I think I saw 17 for a burrito on there which is silly. No tacos either. The must be trying to target a higher end crowd that enjoys blowing money but I was hoping for a nice mexican restaraunt with reasonable prices and a menu that had some mexican favorites.  The inside of the place was very well done and it had the makings of a fun establishment but I am not sure it should be in the corner of strip mall up in north north scottsdale. They would have a better chance down in old towne or near the airpark I think. Good luck to them though.   I will be heading to El Encanto if I am in the mood for some mexican food, or mabye even 1 building over from Dos Diablos to Rubios."}
{"text":"Went for dinner an wasn't greeted at the door. No big deal, let's head over to the bar to look at the winelist... and wait, and wait. Ok let's pretend I don't exist, and I'm freaking starving, I just can't believe the bartender tells me that I can order dinner at the bar. No butthead, I'd like a table and be served, sorry no tip for you. Doubt I'll be back. 9:00pm and heading for a old standby for some comfort food."}
{"text":"Very recently, we made a trip to the newly opened Dos Diablos, in North Scottsdale.    When we first entered the door, we were greeted by very friendly staff, who whisked us to our table posthaste.   As I was being shepherded to my table, my first impression was sports bar, musical entertainment, and nightlife.  There is significantly more space allotted for these types of things, then designated for dinning.  As we were seated, the table staff kicked into gear, made us comfortable, brought us yummy chips/salsa (note: they need to work on their green sauce), and began to explain the menu.  We could see that the portions were huge (spying on other tables) so we decided to split a Caesar salad (typical fare), and a Chimichanga.  We could have done without the salad, as splitting the Chimichanga left us both stuffed.  By the way, the \"Chimi\" was delicious, and worthy of a return trip.  While dining, we happened upon three members of our gated-community, who were also there for the first time, and all gave thumbs up.  In conclusion, I will go back.  There was enough promise of great food to bring me back for another sample.  Just like any new enterprise, they are working on finding their \"voice\", and the servers were very quick to ask, \"tell me what you think\".  In my mind, there probably doesn't exist a 5 star Mexican restaurant, as the food seems more comfort food to me, but this place has the potential, in my mind, to creep up to a 4 star.  The only thing holding me back from that is learning how they will evolve the nightlife.  If this is going to be a noisy place, then they will probably only find me during the day, and not as an evening patron.  I recommend that you give them a try.  They deserve the opportunity to earn your trust."}
{"text":"Sadly, I have to change my original raving review to a big ole YUCK now. The food which was once inventive and interesting is now dull, terribly cooked, and disappointing. The service which was shaky the first time around due to the grand opening hasn't improved. We shared our complaints (4 of us all had awful food) with the chef and the manager. Stella, the manager, was gracious and nice (though didn't do the standard that I would share with my restaurant clients and reduce the bill,) but the chef was less than truly interested in our feedback and in fact you could tell was downright offended. Sadly, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant at all anymore. it's another example of a new chef coming on board and abandoning a fabulous menu out of ego - big fail."}
{"text":"Use to love this place. What happened? Not only was my food cold with a empty reasturant on a Friday at 7 PM but out poor server;;;; went and got the manage and Chef to come to our table, to defend our $ 9.95 less than Taco Bell quality taco. Oh and skip the salsa, go to safeway and buy the no name brand to go at half the price for twice the taste. I said I didnt want any discount... but I will not return. Next stop Blanco. I would rather drive. than to eat Alpho cold  mexican again. North Scottsdale... we deserve better.. B.T.W chef its people like me who make or break a reasturant. dont tell them you know better. next time you make a cold taco it should have lettuce and such. Not look like a taco pizza.."}
{"text":"2.5 star review.  More of a cave-like bar than a restaurant, Dos Diablos was unsurprisingly uncrowded at 5:30 on a Tuesday night.  Decent margarita, fresh tortilla and guacamole, and downhill from there.  Beans were overly oily, tamales bland, and hot salsa had no depth of flavor to it, just heat for the sake of heat.  The outdoor area might be nice for a happy hour drink or two with an appetizer, but I'd skip the entrees."}
{"text":"Im just going to list the bad things.   1) When you are across the shopping center from a Safeway, don't tell me you've run out of oranges.   2) Don't put lardy refried pinto beans in a fish taco. It dulls the flavor and makes the plate heavy and terrible.   3) When chicken is listed as \"de-boned\", do not give us a drumstick. That's just stupid and offensive. Also, \"heavily salted\" does not equal \"spices\".  4) How can you run out of flan, then charge us for it and forget to take it off the bill?  5) Food poisoning is not awesome.   This place is terrible. Their prices are ridiculous, but I assume that since they are up the road from places like Flemmings, they think they can get away with it. Their design motif is also terrible.   I'll give you advice.  Shut this place down, re-open as a bar with your dance floor you tried to pass off as a dining room."}
{"text":"Since moving from California, we have had a hard time finding any places that don't have dulled down food.  It seems everywhere we go the items on menus listed as \"spicy\" are anything but.  We've seen this place a couple of times and really liked the layout and the open air bar/patio area.  We finally tried it last night and wish we'd gone there much sooner.  We tried the filet mignon burrito with the Diablo sauce and it was fantastic.  Fish taco's were really good as well.  The hot salsa was pretty good as well and the service was excellent.  We will definitely be going back and I'll most likely get the filet burrito next time.  They have quite a few beers on tap and a full bar.  One thing that surprised me was the lack of patrons at about 5:45pm on a Saturday.  This place also seems like a great place to watch a game as they have multiple TVs in the restaurant and two bar areas.  May have to go back for one of the Suns playoff games."}
{"text":"The filet mignon burrito is outrageously good. so is the salsa."}
{"text":"Walked in on Saturday night and they had an Elvis impersonator! Tacky, tacky, tacky - very loud and tasteless. If you want to talk and enjoy your company, don't go here. We left."}
{"text":"If it were possible to give a restaurant a negative number of stars, I would.  Ugh.  Bad service.  Bad food.  Very expensive.  The menu is very limited.  The least expensive entree is $14 for a couple of soft tacos.   A side salad is $7.  While most mid priced Mexican restaurants give you free chips, this high priced one charges $2.  I had the $17 Chimichanga.  It was filled with mostly dark meat chicken and not much else.  Certainly not much flavor.  The pork smoked refried beans had a terrible too-much-fake-smoke-seasoning aftertaste.  The rice was the least offensive item on the plate.  My dinner companion had the $15 Chile Verde, which was very bland pork served over soggy rice and a clump of small tortillas that were stuck together.    The service was terrible.  It took quite a while to get our food, and refills for our drinks were non-existent.  The wait staff was disorganized and inattentive.  A couple at the table next to us left before ordering because they had waited so long.  Do yourself a favor.  Skip Dos Diablos.  It was truly one of the worst dining experiences I've had."}
