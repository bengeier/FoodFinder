{"text":"I order from rush street a lot probably 70 times a year. Great pizza and meatball subs. I haven't ordered much else because I haven't had the need. Oh yea I like anchovies that's a plus. It's a real mom and pop place I would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I tried placing an order online but was having trouble logging into my account. I called Rush and the girl that answered the phone couldn't tell me how to retrieve my password, and even though I couldn't log in online and order through the app like I usually do they would let me order what I wanted because it's only available online!  That is basic customer service especially for a long time customer. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"Seriously!!!!! This place is the best EVER!!! You need to get down here and try this pizza and garlic knots!!! Best Service and BEST Food EVER!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A bit expensive but extremely delicious. It's on the greasy side so keep that in mind if you are conscious about that sort of thing."}
{"text":"Ok, we are from Chicago, so we have tried tons of pizza places and we are so glad we found this place!!  Since moving here, I have been amazed at all the decent pizza places to choose from, but Rush Street is by far our favorite!!  Best sausage pizza I have ever had (its crumbled in little pieces which I LOVE) and the crust tastes like New York style crust...YUMMY!  Their pizza sauce is delicious and I absolutely LOVE their garlic knots..slightly crispy on the outside and soft and gooey (good kind of gooey) on the inside and the olive oil/pesto they drizzle on them is sooooo good!  Even their plain cheese pizza (which I get for the kids) is delicious!"}
{"text":"Sometime they run special is your their Facebook friend. Great staff with a friendly smile. The pizza taste great too!"}
{"text":"Had this place twice as delivery. Great garlic knots. Pizza was okay, but came to my door like warm. Still good though!"}
{"text":"For all the REGULARS! Must READ! Wow! Just wow! I should have reviewed this place when it was our go to local mom and pop pizza place near our house because we have always loved it for the almost 6 years we've been living in AZ and ordering from there would have given them 5 stars sorry for the late review... I know other families just like ours in our neighborhood who loved this place just as much... Something different from the chains... FYI! They have new owners! We ordered pizza online just like we would any other time, same exact way and no notice of new owners prior to ordering... We get our pizza delivered and it's COMPLETELY WRONG! Nothing like we normally order or I wouldn't have ordered that way... I would have expected a notice on their website stating they had new owners or something... But no... I call and let them know and the only thing I hear is they have new owners and the way I ordered, which works out any other time, is what confused the people in the kitchen... I'm offered a $5 off discount on my next pizza which I get every so often any ways for being loyal customer... So what was the remedy again? Pizza from rush st is a treat for my boys in this house and to get it and be disappointed is a little sad to me... If I wanted just any old pizza I would have ordered papa nasty johns for half the price... End of rant"}
{"text":"Very good pizza and calzones!  Delivery is normally quick and easy."}
{"text":"Everything that we have ate from this place has been pretty good. The deliveries are fast. The food is hot and tasty! We've had the salads the pizzas the wings and the subs and we recommend this place to anybody. Everything we've had here has been good!"}
{"text":"We order the sub-sandwiches with fries or a salad and they are delicious."}
{"text":"First time there today would not go back pizza was cold and just ordered it bad customer service I guess it depends who you are when you walk in the door .."}
{"text":"Great pizza, fast friendly delivery.  Glad to have this place nearby."}
{"text":"First time there and love it! Owner was most gracious. Ordered a 8\" cheese for my daughter and a Greek pizza for us. Owner brought out a few garlic knots free and they were gone in seconds! Pizza's were hot and delish!"}
{"text":"When I moved out here from the east coast, I had a hard time finding a good pizza that I liked... until I stumbled on this place.  The pizza is fresh, sauce is loaded with good tomato flavor and not over powered by all kinds of spices, cheese is amazing quality, and the regular crust is amazing.  Genuinely good pizza!  Bonus they have gluten free pizza too!!"}
{"text":"I have ordered in a family size pepperoni Pizza  The delivery was great. The crust and cheese was alright. A little too greasy for my taste.   The pepperoni was way light for a family size pizza. Many pieces (pizza cut in squares) did not have any pepperoni on them whatsoever. for 19.99 they could do better.   Thanks,  Joe"}
{"text":"Ordered a few times, pizza has been great each time. Very affordable too. My only complaint is the chicken wings; great flavor, but they don't cook them long enough. Good wings are crispy, they need to keep them in the fryer longer."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. As a Chicago native I decided to give this place a try after moving out here. 1st off- being new to the neighborhood I walked into the place in the late afternoon to ask if they delivered and possibly grab a menu, the gal up front just ignored me and continued her conversation with her friend making her evening party plans. 2nd- I decided to ignore that part, went to my new home and looked the place up in the phone book for the number. Later in the evening I tried calling to place an order and yep, their  phone was busy for at least 20-30 minutes. Finally after getting through I placed my order ( Baked Ziti & Spaghetti and Meatballs) it arrived quickly and nice and hot. My husband and (exhausted from moving all day) opened up the bag and were stunned to see that their sauce looked like watered down tomato paste and an overload of parmigiana cheese. Well since we were so hungry we decided to take a bite and OMG This food is an absolute insult to Chicago's Rush Street Pizza Parlors (it's more like Cabrini-Green Slop)? My advice.... Don't bother, I highly doubt that the owner of the joint has ever tasted a real Chicago meal. Honestly, freaking Pizza Hut is better and the gal up front should offer up a little more customer service. This place is not worth a damn?"}
{"text":"Delivery for a Friday night was pretty fast and the pizza was good. Got wings as well and would not recommend for delivery. They were very soggy and not very good. Should have saved the $$ and the calories."}
{"text":"I love the antipasto salad every time!  Tried the meat lovers pizza first time last night and it was great!  Also ordered a pepperoni pizza but it was pretty sparse on the pepperoni side but tasted ok and kids didn't mind.  Overall everyone is friendly and online ordering easy and good tasting food."}
{"text":"They have fantastic food and the owners are very sweet! I've been getting food from there for 2 years, and the food just gets better and better! Tammie and Gary are extremely friendly! Some of the best pizza I've ever gotten in Arizona! I highly recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"We have been going to Rush Street for several years now and the food is consistently great. the service is always friendly and I do not think we have ever gotten home to find that our order was not right on.   Highly recommend this local pizza joint... we always take it home so the lack of seating has never been a problem.  They also have great coupons and deals so look for them in the mail and in the menus."}
{"text":"We had friends over and ordered delivery. Got a selection of pizza, wings and the appetizer sampler plate. My kids devoured the wings and the apps. The mozzarella sticks were a big hit. The pizza was quite good too."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Rush Street Pizzeria last week.  The place is small up front, a couple big booths, but I hear they have great delivery.  We ate in the restaurant and were helped by the owners, Gary and Tammie.  They were very nice to all the customers that came in.  We had a big antipasto salad, which was loaded with lettuce, meats, peppers, olives, and cheese.  A meal in itself.  We split a large pizza and a dozen wings.  They have maybe 6 different sizes of pizza you can order, including a huge party size. We got the Tammie's Favorite, which had sausage, spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes, if I remember correctly.    It had a fantastic thin crust, much like a New York pizza, but was cut Chicago style.  One of the owners said they'll cut it pie style for those who like to eat it New York style.  Great pie.  Excellent crust, sauce, and they were generous with the ingredients.  The wings are broasted, which is a special way to cook them that makes then very crispy and juicy.  We were impressed at the quality of the food, even though the location is somewhat hidden toward the end of a strip mall with an Albertsons on Riggs Rd.  It's definitely worth visiting, and either eating there, or getting takeout or delivery.  It's a real hidden gem in Chandler."}
{"text":"over the last 6 years, we used to get their pizza, wings, and salad quite often, but their quality has gone down. we now do barros at mcqueen and riggs which is better and more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on 5/9.   Phone service was polite, delivery was on time.  Ordered dozen wings and a pepperoni pizza.  Wings were great....pizza, not so much.  It was luke warm, crust was overcooked, almost no sauce or cheese.  Truly like eating card board.  I called back half way through the meal and voiced my dissatisfaction to the employee.  She offered me $5 off my next order.  I made it clear that wasn't acceptable as the pizza was awful (something I used to think was impossible) and I wished to speak to a manager or the owner.  None was available.  Provided my cell number and made it clear I expected a phone call.   No one bothered.   Hence, I'm on Yelp."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food!!! The only bad thing is having to choose between a delicious pizza or a fantastic sandwich. Great work Tammie & Gary!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. If you're sick of those $5 pizza joints, this place has great flavor, a reasonable price and awesome service. Two thumbs way UP!   Hungry? Get the Jumbo and watch your mouth drop.   Robert Pfeifer"}
{"text":"Pizza is great and really fresh. The salads are equally as good. They also have wonderful customer service. Thanks."}
{"text":"The owner is rude.  The pizza is just OK.  Very inconsistent quality.  I would go to Rosati's instead."}
{"text":"This place is good had the calzone it was nice and cheesy... I did not care for the garlic knots not much garlic at all on them and kinda hard I have had a lot better. The sandwich I ordered was ok needed cheese or something on it will go here again for the calzone!"}
{"text":"My family moved to this area a year ago and began our search for a new pizza place. We tried Rush Street and loved it. We now have a new Friday night tradition  - pizza night from Rush Street. We also love ordering from Rush Street when we watch the UFC fights. We have introduced our families and friends to the delicious, huge pizzas on fight nights. Our favorite is pepperoni and ham wirh extra sauce. The pizza is humongous, delicious, and delivered very quickly. The delivery people are always so friendly. If you're looking for a new pizza place, try Rush Street!"}
{"text":"Tried this place after many neighbors recommended it.  It definitely lives up to their praise.  Really good slice!  Prices are excellent as well.  Pizza for 3 with garlic knots and drinks, fifteen bucks.  It's hard to compare pizza joints by ingredients in a review but I'll say; on par with venezias, definitely better than the chains (Pizza Hut, dominos, etc...) edges out barros.  Worth a try for sure."}
{"text":"We are extremely pleased with their service and food products. We had a family gathering of 14 and our full order arrived at the requested time. The pizzas and wings were oven hot and the best flavor ever. The salad was fresh a crunchy! It was definitely the right decision to chose Rush to provide the food for our gathering!! Everyone was pleased!!"}
{"text":"The veggie with thin crust is my favorite. Soooo good!!! And good business values to boot. Doesn't get better than that."}
{"text":"Just had my first Pizza at Rush st. A Large pepperoni n mushroom! Crust was cooked just perfect! Toppings fresh and plentiful! Young girl taking our order was polite and greeted us with a big smile. Just the kind of quality and service you hope for!"}
{"text":"We have been loyal customers for several years but the bait and switch promos, food quality, and broken promises are the last straws for us. Always try to support local businesses but this one is officially off the list. Good luck with your business strategy"}
{"text":"bad service.   told me 15 minutes on the phone.  i get there in 15 and the tell me it's going to be another 7 minutes....  ok.  i can tolerate that.  well that turned into a 25 minute wait.  i'm a first time customer and now a last time customer."}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza in town!  Super friendly owners!  I really loved the wings."}
{"text":"The first time we ate at Rush Street was about a year ago when visiting family in the area.  We were just back during Thanksgiving and made it a MUST to stop in again for a pre-Thanksgiving pizza dinner!    Pizza is not something I eat very often (although I would like to!) so when I do indulge, I want it to be worth the experience - and again it was.  LOVE the crust (that perfect not too thin - not to thick crust) and it's a treat to find a place that has excellent green chili as a topping.  I even saw that they now have a 'cracker crust' for those that are looking for a super carb friendly pie!  Great food, fun/family environment and worth the trip.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND RUSH STREET PIZZA!"}
{"text":"The owners reached out and convinced me to give them another try. We now get it on a regular basis. With their specials, it's not over priced. I would give them 5 stars, but they can't seem to ever get my order of BONELESS wings right. I always order boneless, and they always give me regular. Last time they tried to tell me I ordered wrong, but I had ordered online and had the email showing it was supposed to be boneless. So they sent out some more."}
{"text":"Looks like they have pre-made cooked pizza.  ie cheese, pepperoni and then place your other ingredients on and place it in the oven when you order the crust was bad, pizza was bad. Garlic knots were good. Won't be ordering again"}
{"text":"Pizza was decent. Wasn't bad wasn't great. Pretty greasy. Price is a little high. Paid $2 for additional topping and barely had a second topping. Not bad but probably won't order again"}
{"text":"I live down the street from this place and I've been here maybe 5 times. Up until the last time I was here (7:30 PM Tues, Jan 15, 2013) I have always had a great experience. Fair prices, good specialty pizzas, nice staff. However, on Tues night I went there for my usual favorite \"lasagna\" pizza and found different staff, a different floor/seating layout, and a different vibe in general. Weird. Anyway, I asked if they could make me a lasagna pizza and the girl taking my order didn't know what I was talking about. Also, the prices had increased a couple dollars per pizza since last time. Alright, so it had been a few months since I'd last been there, whatever. So, I order the other pizza flavor I've tried, the \"Rush Streeter.\"   I take the pizza home and find it to be very soppy and greasy in the center. Not good and not what I normally see from this place. I'm hungry though, so I still dig in. Well, about an hour later, I start to feel my stomach get tight. 3 hours later I am puking and purging my guts out from both ends because that pizza gave me food poisoning!!! It has taken me, what, 3 days to get well enough to write out my disgust about that experience on Yelp. It is not acceptable at any time for a restaurant to give you food poisoning, no matter what the previous experiences were like. This indicates poor food handling, storage, freshness, and/or cleanliness. No matter what the cause is, I will not return. If new management have taken over, guess what, YOU HAVE FAILED. If the old management is still in charge, well then, YOU HAVE WORK TO DO REGARDING YOUR TUESDAY NIGHT STAFF.  Edit: Tammie, you said your company has never had a case of food poisoning. Well guess what, it has one now, recorded forever here on Yelp. Your counter argument based on me not understanding the difference between the flu and food poisoning is weak and insulting. Can't you admit that your temporary crew dropped the ball and provided a subpar pizza that gave someone food poisoning?"}
{"text":"Over the last few weeks quality has really gone down hill. Mostly customer service is suffering, but it's also reflected in the food. First problem was when I had to beg for a side of meatballs without any pasta. The order taker finally capitulated, but a customer shouldn't have to beg to spend money at an establishment. The final straw was when we placed an order online, and after waiting for an hour and 45 minutes, still no food.  I can only attribute the recent deficiencies to the change in ownership. It's truly unfortunate. We used to order from Rush Street several times a week, but not any longer. We'll find another establishment going forward."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place. We were out last evening and thought it would be a good opportunity to order and pick up a pizza when we got home. I have the menu, which said they are open until 10 pm and it was only 8:45, so no problem. I called to order and was told, \"sorry, we've shut the ovens off for the night.\"  What???  I wonder if the boss knows they are shutting down that early. So, we drove to Panda Express. They were actually in the process of closing, but invited us in and filled our order. Hey, Rush Street Pizza, we likely won't try again."}
{"text":"The pastas and meatball sandwiches here are delicious!!! The pizza is sub-par, but I'll focus my review on their non-pizza menu options. Extremely good and they deliver locally!  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Only giving 4 stars because my parents love the place. Personally, I'd give it a 3. Not too impressed, could be better"}
{"text":"I order from here more often than I care to admit :/  They are the ONLY place in my neighborhood (besides Dominos) that delivers Pizza. They have ALWAYS been on-time (30-45min delivery wait) and their drivers/deliverers are always friendly and nice.  The pizza is pretty decent and occasionally yummy - the crust I get (not the thin one) is tasty but I find always missing a bit of salt (though I'm a salt fanatic).  I find the toppings are not always piled on, just kind of tossed on so there are bald spots. The picture I posted is of the 2nd to the last order I made, which had more toppings than the last one I ordered.  Basically, they are a family run place so I'll mostly always give them business before a chain.. plus, they're nice, prompt, and consistent.  When I'm craving pizza and stuck at home, they are the only place I think to order from."}
{"text":"This place is small, like two-and-a-half booths small.  On a Sonoran, winter afternoon, this could be troublesome as a cool draft of air will slither in every time somebody opens the door.  No fountain drinks.  Beyond that the menu is pretty huge considering it's such a teeny space.  Pizzas ranging from small personal pizzas and running the gamut up through a big 24\" monster.  The prices are respectably decent, no price gouging.  The day I went I had a meatball sub with fries which was one of the many lunch specials they offer.  It was $5.50 but an even $6 bucks with tax.  Not bad at all.  The male cashier, who I assume is also one of the owners, wasn't all that personable but he wasn't rude.  He just seemed like he would rather be in the back doing anything other than manning the register.    When the female cashier returned, which I am assuming is the other owner, she was very nice and hospitable.  She checked on me a couple times to make sure I had everything I needed.  I'm not the biggest meatball sub freak but every once in a while I'll get the urge to take one on.  I'm glad I did today.  It was great.  Everything was served piping hot.  If anything I would say the sauce could be a little more flavorful but it's not anything that would keep me from ordering this same sandwich again.  This place is in the strip mall/shopping center that also houses Albertson's, Chen's Chinese and AZ Hair Company.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I have to say this is by far my favorite pizza place. Very well worth it. Even better when you pick up because it's so hot, fresh and the employees are so pleasant and it's affordable. Big menu, I even had a Chicago dog and my sister had an Italian beef. It was good!  Please, give them business, they deserve it!"}
{"text":"Really good family owned pizza shop. Stopped in after coming from the Splash Pad down the street with my kids. We ate there, the employees were extremely friendly and VERY hospitable. They kept checking on us to see if we needed anything and even engaged in some chit chat with my boys which they always have a million questions as most kids do and the one employee she stood there and carried on a conversion with them lol. That in my book is worth 5 stars alone so THANK YOU. The food was good as well.   Next time I'm in this area, we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Food is just OK. Called the other day and I think the person on the other end must have been stupid because they answered my question with a question. Cooks in the back look really weird and the place is a mess. Don't think I will ever go back there again and save you money. Its not worth it."}
{"text":"I have ordered pizza here about 8 times or so and it has been AWESOME except for twice. So after the second time I called and spoke with the owner,Brian. Both problems had to do with the happy Greek pizza being so salty I couldn't eat it. After speaking with the owner we came up with the thought together that there was probley extra olive juice that got put on. I can't say enough about Brian as he took time to try and figure out the problem as this is my favorite pizza, most of the time. On top of that he gave me a free pizza for a later date, and it was delicious! I will continue to get my pizza from here. Thanks Brian you are doing business right and I love your pizza, customer for life!"}
{"text":"It's ridiculous how much this place went into the dumps when the new owners took over.. completely different environment, staff, customer service & recipes. Very disappointment to see my fav pizza joint end up like this. Don't waste your time just try somewhere else instead."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I live right behind the location and I order from here all the time. I'm obsessed with the mozzerella sticks and the pizza! I've joined the online program which sends you complimentary coupons through email which is awesome. The only complaints I'd have would be that sometimes I've ordered from here at night, about an hour before they close, and I received the food cold. I live 2 minutes away so I was surprised! I called back and talked to them about it hoping they would replace my meal, but they didn't. They assured me they would check and make sure the order was hot the next time. My food has only arrived to me cold once though! Other than that, this place has good food and I'd definitely suggest it, just make sure if you order at night that the food is hot. Lol."}
{"text":"Good pizza at a fair price. The salads are good and quite large!  Fast delivery, better than Pizza Hut or dominos, it's super close, so it's convenient for us."}
{"text":"Ok,I am so very impressed with this pizza parlor! I tried it today and I have to say they are a keeper! The price was very fair and the quality was way more than I expected! Absolutely delicious,I will be returning weekly from now on,thanks!"}
{"text":"I'm about a mile out of delivery range, but it's worth the drive for pizza from this place.  Owners are onsite and amazing to work with.    Buffalo Chicken Pizza is one of my favorites, and this place makes it the best in the East Valley!  Some of the best pizza around, at some of the best prices around!"}
{"text":"IMHO, a perfect pizza should be defined as the perfect blend of sauce, cheese and crust.   Unfortunately, a forth criteria would seemingly derail the aforementioned for many pizza lovers: consistency. Rush Street produces a decent (read--not terrific) pizza at best. Order on a Friday and Saturday night when that \"consistency\" is challenged by business volume and demand, and the pizza becomes a tasteless piece of cardboard that doesn't deserve our business or money, so, our search goes on for a worthy pizza in AZ..."}
{"text":"Did new owners take over this place? Their pizza is completely different now, and I ordered a meatball sub which was a mistake. There was so much gristle and odd crunchy \"things\" in the meatballs I couldn't even eat the sandwich. So GROSS. Please do not ever order the meatball sub. Very sad, we used to order from rush street regularly."}
{"text":"I left an favorable review about a year ago.  Since then this place has been sold.  I now wish I could retract that prior review.  According to State public records someone named Brian Burton now owns it.  It is now terrible.  It's obvious it is understaffed and the quality has gone way down.  They told me it would be 25 minutes, which I thought was a long time to wait for pizza and salad.  But I waited 45 minutes instead.  They said the recipes were the same as before, but the food did not come out the same.  The pizza was crust was mushy and the shape of the pizza was sloppy.  It did not even look appetizing.  The salad was just lettuce with a tomato and few other things added.  It was not good.  This place was great when the original owners, Gary and Tammy, ran it.   I was a regular back then.  I will never go to Rush Street again.  And I suggest you not go either."}
{"text":"Great wings, delicious pizza, very kind delivery staff. We order food for delivery on occasion, and I have yet to have any problems with this place. It is in a convenient area for where we live and a great place to order from."}
{"text":"Dank pizza, Great flavor, delicious cheese, awesome customer service and very prompt! All the way from Oregon! Will be back!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from rush street and it was amazing!!  The order came out correct and the food was so good. We got the rattlesnake pizza with fried zucchini! This is definitely our new place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, they have some of the best pizza sauce and their dough is phonominal.  My personal favorite feature of their menu is the naked, boneless wings.  Lastly the pricing is great for what you get...  if I ever crave pizza and wings I get them here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza delivery places in the Gilbert area.  Lots of choices and the everything we have ordered is awesome!"}
{"text":"Soooo... We have eaten here a lot! They have good pizza and they deliver!   Sometimes you just need something besides papa johns or Pizza Hut or even barro's.    Although, I put them in line with regular pizza places they are so much better. They offer a variety of options from deserts, salads, pizza and subs. All are good!   I love their homemade pizza puff desert with cinnamon and sugar and I have to fight my son for the last one!   I also love their thin crust it's really good and the meatball pizza is Amazing! We have ordered there maybe 10 times and maybe once we got a 3.5 star pizza. All other 9 times its been 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place NEVER lets me down! Great pizza and the delivery people are always SO COURTEOUS!"}
{"text":"Awesome family pizza spot! Have a huge 24' pizza pie available so it's perfect for family dinners or parties! Also the cannolis were a massive bite of home (New Jersey)! Would visit again   PS- the staff is super welcoming, helpful and nice! Always a plus and really makes or breaks the visit!"}
{"text":"1st time ordering delivery from Rush Street. Family owned and operated which I absolutely love and want to patronize, however the pizza was just ok. We ordered delivery and felt that Barros Pizza is much better.  The flavor was kind of bland, the sauce had a hint of sweetness, and the dough was tough and rubbery tasting.  I know they have been around quite a few years and hope they continue many more for all that enjoy their food.  Probable wont be back."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, average service. The first time I ate here the female owner was on the phone berating her husband for something- at the cash register, in front of customers. I've had better pizza at most local joints, but they get the exta star for always having a coupon for Yelpers, like a free 2 liter of soda or half order of their garlic knots with purchase.  Overall it's a quick and easy place to grab a slice of pizza or split a pie. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to the area (dec) and have ordered here at least 5 times now getting something different each time. Have not been disappointed yet! Pizza-great, Pasta-great, calzone-huge and great, but you must get the cinnamon puffs delicious"}
{"text":"Still the best around! I moved 16 miles away. I still come back here when I can. Order pizza here!!"}
{"text":"Brian, I spoke to your manager today. She has my contact information and all my account information. This is not slander because it was an accurate portrayal of what happened. This is also not a false report. Please be mindful of your accusations as they are false and based on your assumption and not the true facts. I look forward to speaking to you tomorrow so we can put your presumption of a false report at bed.   Thank you  Update: The owner did not call me. I reached out again and he was not in.   Another Update: Still Nothing from the owner.   Never heard back from the owner and based on the reviews I can see this is not something new. I can see the reviews have not improved and long time loyal customers have decided to seek other establishments. With Uber Eats, Postmates, and other delivery services, why would you settle to mediocre food at best"}
{"text":"Had heard great things all around about Rush Street so we decided to give it a try. Is says on their website that you can dine in, but the seats are very limited. Although it was tight, the staff made us feel very welcome and ensured we had a table to eat in there.   The food was flavorful, hot and tasted very fresh.  They have 8\" pizzas that are only 3.99 and great for the kids.   They even deliver within a large range of miles.   We will return for sure!! I recommend it!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to update that after the manager reached out to us we tried them again. We've also had them several times since and I feel like all of the kinks have been worked out. The service and quality I feel are back to what it was previously. Thank you for reaching out Brian. I hadn't noticed that until quite a bit of time had passed."}
{"text":"We love this pizza place and have been ordering every weekend for a few years, always getting it delivered. It's always been delicious.  What upset me was a few months ago our delivery driver dropped off our pizza and said rather rudely, by the way, we can't deliver to you anymore, you are right out of the zone now. First, why not tell me this when I'm on the phone ordering the pizza? It bothered me that my movie/date night (only night for hubs and I where kids are down and we treat ourselves) is interrupted with rudeness and disappointing information. And second, how, after years of delivery every weekend, are we right out of your zone? I can still opt for delivery on your online ordering option and my address is accepted. We haven't moved, you haven't moved, what changed after years? And the driver said it's by like .03 miles. Come on! Why have your delivery driver tell me this and miss out on loyal customers? I called the next day and was told a manager would call me back but they never did.  We have tried picking up the pizza instead, but it just isn't the same. It interrupts our movie night, we want to have a glass of wine not drive, and usually wakes a kid, and then, if you are picking up food the options are endless so why pizza?  I don't know. The pizza and zucchini is so good and I want to be your customer, it is upsetting that you guys were so rude and unthankful for our business and loyalty!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of their pizza and wings, but they are the best choice out here and have decent prices. I will say I have had their steak sandwich before and it was AMAZING! I am exciting to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This is probably the best pizza I've ever had service is great the people are kind and their extra extra large pizza is unbelievably huge the prices are great the sauce is fantastic I think everything that I have tried hear from sandwiches the salad pizza to their pasta everything is absolutely fantastic I highly recommend Brust Street pizza it's a great neighborhood pizzeria I wish there were more locations"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Arizona..Hands down! They also have great appetizers and their pasta really yummy too! If your sick of the 'chain' pizza joints..This is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Food is actually good and more like a 4 out of 5 stars but they seem to have a revolving door of rude employees working for them which unfortunately HAS to lower the overall review/score, especially since my husband and I argue every time over who's gonna actually call in our order (it's like dealing with the soup nazi from Seinfeld). We try to support local businesses but the girl who was annoyed while taking our order tonight and then hung up on me when I called back after an hour and 10 mins to see if it was en route for delivery is the exact reason we will be ordering from Domino's or Papa John's instead going forward."}
{"text":"Pizzas okay, hand Taylored to your needs, sadly Dallas is out of their delivery range, so 1 star service but 5 stars in my heart. PS, any ham on your pizza is a plus here"}
{"text":"Pizza here is really good. The price is excellent. I'm glad someone finally took ownership of this pizzeria. In 2005 it was summer the worse Service and pizza I've ever had.  My mom lives here so we started eating frequently on the side of town. Rush Street street is now our go to pizza."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best place in Chandler for Chicken Wings!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. They always lie about their delivery time. They say it will be an hour but it's never more than 20 minutes. :-)  Their ingredients taste great. Delivery is stupid fast. We love it. They have replaced Rosati's in our house."}
{"text":"The garlic knots were so small!!! The size of a grape tomato.  The pizza was terrible.  No taste.  A few slices of Pepperoni and a sprinkle of beef and sausage flavoring.  Couldn't find the meat. And it was called a meatlovers pizza!  Wheres the BEEF!    Not worth the trip.  We never order again.  Pizza Hut would have been better even though thats not real pizza. NYPD Pizza could you move to RIGGS Please!!"}
{"text":"Tammie and Gary, the owners, were very oncerned about improving on my prior experience and they did so! We really enjoyed our sandwiches and recommend both the food and the service. It is a ood thing to support local family owned businesses these days, and I hope you all will support Rush Street Pizza!"}
{"text":"New owners are not the same. Menu has less items & food does not taste as good. Bummer!!"}
{"text":"Ordered their pizza 3 times so far, each time it's been great.  Once, I even had then deliver it straight to my backyard and they humored me.   I also have enjoyed their desserts very much. Hopefully this will continue so we can have a long relationship :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their pizza. Great taste and perfect amount of toppings. Friendly staff and quick delivery is awesome."}
{"text":"Pizza is always good and the service is outstanding. We have been here many times and are always ready to go back. We have found that the sandwiches are spectacular. They always accommodate my strange requests for additions to the pizza.   We always do take-out so the size is never a problem for us.   Best part... always greated with a smile."}
{"text":"Rush Street never disappoints! We've loved everything we've tried. Their pizza is one of the best in the valley. The owners, Tammie & Gary, are great."}
{"text":"Good NY style pizza cooked just as you like it & they deliver.  When we carry out the staff is always friendly & always willing to give us packets of cheese & peppers."}
{"text":"Not sure maybe I was wrong but thought it was supposed to be Chicago Pizza it's not.  Hubby and I are both from Chicago and it's just not.  Too spendy for quality rather grab a papa Murphy's.   Just a didn't like anything about it enough to comment. Did I spit it out ? No but won't get it again.  I had high hopes since it's called Rush Street"}
{"text":"The wife and I wanted to try something \"new\" for a change so we jumped on Yelp.  Rush St. Pizza had some good recent reviews, garlic knots, and best of all; a Yelp coupon.   With all of that working in their favor we had to give them a try.    We ordered a thick crust pizza and some garlic knots.  The pizza was good (lots of cheese, so I was happy) and the garlic knots were amazing.  We will definitely go back and try something else on the menu (and of course get the large order of garlic knots this time)."}
{"text":"We ordered two pizzas for pick up. One pepperoni onion and garlic, the other meatball green chili and onions. Fresh ingredients made for tasty pizza. Very reasonably priced and very quick (25 for the two, 15 mins for pickup). All in all, I will eat there again. Just wish they'd add a little more sauce."}
{"text":"This was our first time ordering from here. We usually order from rosatis but have been disappointed with the consistency and service. We found rush st. on yelp and decided to give it a shot. We don't order pizza often so when we do order we are really looking forward to it!(it's our cheat meal) I have to say as soon as I called Rush st. I was impressed, the girl on the phone took her time with me explaining the pizza crusts and was extremely friendly(this was at 7pm on a Friday, so I am sure she was busy). We placed the order which was really well priced, and quoted an hour. The delivery took about an hour and 20 minutes, no big deal. When the driver got to our door he was extremely friendly, and then introduced himself as the owner saying that he delivered ours and a few others tonight because they/we were first time customers and wanted to thank us and introduce himself! Wow, customer service like that is so rare, we immediately forgot about the extra 15 -20 minute wait. The pizza itself was fantastic we ordered a pepperoni and sausage pizza thin crust and a dozen medium wings. Everything tastes great! He even gave us some special seasonings they carry. Overall I have to say we have never been this impressed with a pizza delivery and when we order pizza next it will be from Rush st."}
{"text":"Good Family owned restaurant.  Love supporting local business. Food was good service was even better."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are the only thing we tried but boy are they good! The bread is amazing, the meats and cheeses and topping are fresh too.  We had someone pick up food for us as we were on our way in to town for thanksgiving. They said the cashier forgot the garlic knots and when they realized it, they said they were closing and pretty much \"oh well\" and gave a random $1.50 discount. Because Wednesday's have a special of 2 sandwiches for $14.99, that's what we got because they forgot our garlic knots and the cashier didn't seem very aware or really cared about anything.   That being said. I have to still give them the 4 stars, the sandwiches were great and the side salads were fresh and crisp and the Italian dressing and caesar dressing we're very flavorful and a good consistency.   If I lived in Arizona, I'd be back and my mother in law orders from there often for a reason!"}
{"text":"Ordered Rush Street Pizza for the first and last time. I ordered online and although my online order reflected what I wanted what we received was not correct. I called the restaurant and had a manager \"explain\" to me what I ordered. I was staring at the online order on my Ipad so it was somewhat comical that she was telling me I wrong. She never offered to make it right which is disappointing but I suppose customer service isn't a priority to every business."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try since it has good reviews and they deliver...   This place gets a 1-star for fast delivery. As for the pizzas we ordered(Rush Steeter and Cheese) this place gets a 0 star! Let's start with the cheese which tasted like a cardboard with a little bit of cheese. For $5 I could have just gone to Little Cesar's and be more satisfied. The Rush Streeter was basically chopped onions and chopped bell peppers. Assuming it's named after the company, it should taste and presented much better.   Definitely not worth the calories and not worth the stomach space! Lesson learned, will be ordering somewhere else next time!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Pizza is always top notch. Rarely can I find anchovies and they have those too!  Prices very good. Even the personal size is plenty big for a great price!!"}
{"text":"So we have tried this place three times!!  First time it took 20 minutes more than quoted and the pizza was cold!  Second time we ordered plain cheese pizza and salad- we got pepperoni pizza and no salad . Called the store and got told to just eat what they delivered- no apology, no refund and no re delivery..  Why did I go for a third time?? Well I'm home sick and they are the only place that delivers here.  Food was cold and didn't get what I ordered.  Called up and was told I was lying and that their screen Said that I ordered.something else. I offered to send a photo of the receipt that I have in my email or forward it to them to show they were wrong. Got told will give you a credit towards your next purchase which doesn't help because the food that was delivered was not what I ordered and we still need to eat. This is the worst Italian food and restaurant I have ever eaten!!!their customer service is awful rude obnoxious they charge you for food you don't get go somewhere else don't order from this place!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this find of a unique not a chain pizza place. We live in the neighborhood and enjoy letting Rush Street make dinner! Super great delivery young man named Michael. Love the wings too!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! The first time we got it, 3 and a half years ago. After that I think they changed the recipe or something because the pizza looked completely different. Maybe I will give them another try the next time I am in Chandler, but for now they get 2 stars. The third star is for how friendly they are, that is the one thing about Rush St. that I admire. The people are so nice and give out free water bottles, and I often see them feeding the cats that live outside of Albertson's."}
{"text":"The worst pizza I have LITERALLY ever eaten. Worse than then the grossest frozen pizza I've ever had!! Plus... I ordered pineapple on our crap pizza, was charged for it, but zero pineapple. Trust me. Go buy totinos from frys instead:"}
{"text":"Its Thursday night! We want to order pizza, but my last experience was bad. We thought we would give it a second chance. I ordered exactly the same thing, but made sure it had sauce. IMO they are organized and keep a really good record of what happens in the system. So if you had issues the one time they will try and correct it the first time. I am giving a 5 star review only based off the fact that, when the pizza had sauce on it, it turned out to be amazing. Maybe its not exactly east coast pizza, but more than likely the rumor is true, PH level in the water makes a difference. The pizza tasted well seasoned, moist, but crispy where it needed to be. Closest place so far to the east coast. Pizza is well priced. Only thing I would have to say that i wish was different, but it is now the present is that, \" The first ordered should have been replaced without cost, not have to pay half price for another order.\" Like i said though when the pizza came this time it was very well made.   To another note. I was happy that when the order did arrive to the house, the owner did show up and apologized for what had happened last time. Does it make up for last time? Yes and no, but to the most extent i would say yes, because that was very respectful and rational to do so. He also brought us a delicious desert. I would definitely recommend this place after my experience tonight. I will have updates as time goes on and am looking forward to eating from RUSH ST PIZZA once more. I imagine that the great Thursday experience I just had will continue to be just as delightful.  *********In response to Tami:  Thank you for the offer. Anyhow, yes, that was my first time personally ordering. There are other people in my house that use my finances to order pizza, Chinese and or anything that includes takeout in case I am not home."}
{"text":"So on a positive note, our pizza arrived about 20 minutes early and the delivery guy was super nice.  Now for the product. Well, I've had better pizza at Chuck E Cheese. Our super greasy cardboard pizza was ordered half \"specialty\" and half pepperoni and came as 3/4 and 1/4. I'll let you guess which was which. We also got the Garlic Knots with marinara. Also super greasy and chewy (not a good chewy either) and the marinara came in one of those 1 oz cups to go salad dressing cups and there were like 10 knots. Really? Unfortunately it was a total waste of $30. Save yourself some \"dough\" and get a Freschetta."}
{"text":"Kids enjoyed it! It was SUPER greasy though. Wings were Awesome! Great customer service. I had a weird request and they did it no questions asked. Nice job!!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery. Customer service was very friendly on the phone and with delivery. Price was great for the quality of pizza. They had many options other than pizza like salad and sandwiches. Will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"The food is always good. It's very clean, and I enjoy going to a small family owned place."}
{"text":"Can't really comment too much on the pizza, as they don't have gluten-free, but my kids seem to love it.  The wings on the other hand, I've eaten plenty of.  The spicy BBQ are some of the best wings I've ever eaten.  Good sized and incredible flavor.."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly an helpful. The food is to die for! All of it even the desserts! Love the cheese pizza. The pieces are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"We have ordered pizza, garlic knots, and wings from here multiple times and have unfortunately been unpleased with it all but once! Not only is the food not fantastic but we had a coupon to use and were told, by the cashier, that we would have to come back and use the coupon when a manager was there because she didn't know how to do coupons!!! Wtf?! Needless to say we won't be back!!"}
{"text":"What made this place so great was how kind the people who owned the place were. It had a great family feel to it. The food was great quality and priced well. Would definitely encourage folks to try this place out"}
{"text":"Ordered the jumbo meat lovers pizza and it was excellent!! Great flavors and sauce!! If you like New York style pie, I highly recommend Rush St."}
{"text":"My husband loves their thin crust pizza! I like it but don't love it. Their salads are amazing and the garlic knots. Good pricing and there's always coupons offered for next time."}
{"text":"We just ordered 2 extra large pizzas last week when we had friends visiting. The best that we've had since ordering here. Nice to support family owned businesses! Great food!  UPDATE: we have ordered from them twice since the new owners took over and sadly the food has gone downhill. Our latest order on Friday was for a 1/2 pepperoni and half marguerita pizza and I specifically asked the girl if it would be a problem since the pepperoni would have the red sauce. She said it wouldn't be a problem to do the marguerita pizza side with the oil and garlic sauce. I told her I would order two smaller pizzas if it was a problem. We get the pizza and the rest of our order which was wings and knots and sure enough the entire pizza had red sauce. The pizza used to be by far our favorite and now the flavor isn't as good either. So sad. The knots didn't taste the same either. Bummer as we like to frequent small businesses."}
{"text":"I attempted to order pizza online the other night and their website was not working correctly. I called the resturant and told them the issue i was having and asked if they would honor the web specials over the phone since the website was not working. The girl on the phone said \"no\" they would not, and informed me several other people were having the same issues recently. It sounded like she could really care less. Not the way to get new customers. Very disappointed..."}
{"text":"I order from rush street on a regular basis and I always get great service and excellent pizza. They also have a great steak sub. The only complaint I have is that when I the pizza became popular the owner raised the prices substantially."}
{"text":"I just noticed the owner said he still had not heard from me, it's ok because I tried again last week to order from Rush, we called and spoke to a girl when my husband tried to order the chicken dinner (which is listed under pasta) he told her which pasta he wanted on the side with the chicken dinner. Menu said it comes with it. She promptly told him pasta doesn't come with the pasta dinner...hmmm weird. So I get on the phone and tried to explain but she was not hearing it, cancelled the order and decided we really really need to find a new place.  My bad for trying again."}
{"text":"My company recently relocated offices a mile away from this restaurant. I visited there for the first time today and let me say. Not only was the woman inside very pleasant accommodating, she makes a damn great calzone. I will be returning and telling everyone I know about this place. Do yourself a favor and get your butts here add soon as you can. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"My favorite takeout pizza joint. Delicious pizza, and appetizers. The cinnamon puffs are Amazing! Speedy delivery. Great customer service as well."}
{"text":"For darn good NY Pizza, this is the place to go!   Love the meatball pizza, simply DELICIOUS!  Great specials online and if you mention the special during pickup they'll give you that special price.  My go-to Pizza place from now on!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking forward to trying out some of the local places in this area of town. Unfortunately, our experience with the food here was poor.   We placed an order for delivery and our wings showed up uncooked and raw. All of the chicken was pink with areas of red and blood in them. I placed a call to the restaurant as we all know mistakes can happen. I was put on the phone immediately with one of the owners which I thought was great customer service. However, this idea was then suddenly shattered. The owner then told me she had just eaten some of the wings and they were great and she can assure me this has never happened. I felt as if she thought I was lying to her just to get a refund. Far from the truth! We just don't want to get food poisoning!  The owner is refunding our money and has taken care of the situation. However, being accusatory instead of apologetic will make us never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We are here as snow birds and like to try local food spots. We try to stay away from chains while we are here. Read about Rush Street on Foursquare. It's the best.  We usually get a meat lovers pizza About once a month. The crust is the best. Just the right amount of sauce and toppings. We order online which is so easy. We recommend Rush Street for the best pizza in Chandler."}
{"text":"Awful pizza that was cold and tasteless. Not a good start to our search for the best local pizza joints."}
{"text":"Well I decided to go back and try Rush Street again last night and I'm sure glad I did. I ordered a large pepperoni pizza and a couple of chocolate dipped cannolis and enjoyed them both tremendously. On top of that, I unknowingly showed up at closing time and the people inside acted very happy to cook my order instead of trying to send me away like many other restaurants will.  I also had a great time chatting with (what I assume was) the owners and their employees while I waited for my pizza to cook.    Their plentiful coupons and specials allow for very reasonable pricing on a very enjoyable meal. Add in their excellent customer service, something tough to find nowadays when looking for an inexpensive meal, I can't see myself ordering a pizza from anywhere else when I'm looking for delivery or take out in South Chandler."}
{"text":"Pizza was good.  Just an observation, but not a place you're really going to sit down and eat.  They have a few tables in the lobby but the area is so small and with foot traffic for take out it wouldn't be a great place to sit down and have a meal.  Not a 4 and not a 3...probably a 3.5"}
{"text":"I may be a little biased in my review, as I do not like thin crust pizza. So we decided to go with the deep dish crust and it was thin crust pizza, with a huge edge. I was not impressed with the crust for that reason, it was no where near deep and the edge was too much. It folded over, and made an even worse left over. The topings have a great flavor and they use alot of cheese, no need to order extra. My husband heard great reviews from this place and so we went out of our way to get here. However I would not go back unless I was in the area. Too much good stuff close to home. Has seating inside although it is a small place so I would recommend take out if you have the option."}
{"text":"I work nearby at a school, and we order from them for the students all of the time. They give us awesome deals, so we always go back. They're good to us.  Last night my daughter and I went there for an early dinner, and we ordered a pepperoni, black olive and jalapeno pie. It was ready in 10 minutes, and it was really tasty. They said it's chicago style, but it wasn't. It is thin, so it's like a NY-style that I like.   The drink list was limited (carbonated was about it), and I wanted an ice tea. The bathroom is back behind the kitchen and the place is small, but most people who work there are friendly.  You can't beat the price, and they do deliver."}
