{"text":"Boy for a Saturday they sure are slow! 13 people in line and the guy taking the order got the name wrong. ..weirdest spelling of Lena I've ever seen. The 43rd and bell location doesn't seem to have the same problem. Two employees didn't wear hats or hair nets what's with that what about health code?"}
{"text":"Horrible service. First, I wanted it to go and it was presented to me for dine in. Second, the sandwich was wrong, even after I asked if it was a BLT with Avocado. Good thing I checked before I left. And there was no acknowledgement of the inconvenience and wait time. That goes a long way. Will likely find another Einstein to go to."}
{"text":"This is the place my wife and I come every weekend. Good food and great service. Walnut strudel is my favorite."}
{"text":"I went to order on Tuesday 1 bagel and waited about 10 minutes about 4 people getting there orders and i only order 1 for the first time at this store.  then went the next day and a lady was waiting for her bagel she said for about 10 minutes people passing her up i told her same thing happen to me at this store. Today i went to get another bagel for my husband and i decided to order one for me and they give me the wrong bagel and i work 10 minutes from the place and have to be at work on time and its frustrating to open your bagel and get the wrong bagel. They have at least 5-6 people on staff and seems like they don't know what is going on.  I have to go to market buy my bagels and toast at work now. the bagel shop was on Summerlin Cheyenne by Albertsons store. I got to work to call them they gave me the wrong bagel and phone rang at 8:50am 10 times on one answer and  i called the catering ext and they are going to send a request to the store for me."}
{"text":"best bagels ever. and you can't beat their Monday deal! the breakfast foods are pretty good but it can get busy really fast so the staff can get overwhelmed. great for take-out though!"}
{"text":"Chelsea, the store manager, has exceptional customer service skills. She made me feel very comfortable and welcome in the store. She greets and says goodbye to all the customers in the friendliest manner. I have never experienced such great service Thank you Chelsea!"}
{"text":"The Caribou affiliation has ruined this place. coffee and bagel used to be $3.20 with the reusable mug, since the change to Caribou the price has gone up twice and is now $5.76! I won't even talk about how poorly the place is now laid out. I now go down the road to Chompies and pay 25% less than Caribou."}
{"text":"This location continues to disappoint me. Not only is the service always slow and confused, seemingly focusing on all the things that don't need to be focused on, like refilling the sugar packs when there are 20 people waiting for their bagels. But this morning they had hardly any bagels and had only been open for about 30 minutes...and gave me no explanation when I asked about it."}
{"text":"Friendly faces and good sandwiches. Best place to grab a superquick bite and eat on patio."}
{"text":"Wow, this location sucks! Not the first time I've gotten my order wrong here. But the first time I've had to wait 8min for them to start making it! The manager was more interested in socializing with another employee. And amidst all that, my orders wrong. I'm no longer coming to this location and I'd highly recommend you to do the same."}
{"text":"I love einstiens coffee and bagels!
Why dont you have WIFI ????? Deal breaker - i go to the starbucks across the street for this sole reason."}
{"text":"This is an update. Lately the wifi has been taken out of this place for the last couple of months. 
I guess they don't like the laptop wielding kind..."}
{"text":"Ordered several six cheese type bagels, fellow asked if I wanted them sliced, of course.Big mistake, the bagels were cut so uneven I had to throw several out. Next time I'll sliced them my self"}
{"text":"Love this place! I like that they are always able to tell me which bagels accommodate my dietary needs (vegan). In love with the pumpkin bagels. I look forward to them every fall. :)"}
{"text":"My few experiences at this company's bagel place has been bad, the only reason I like it is because their breakfast choices. I highly recommend Brueggers Bagels, love the Rio Grande Turkey sausage wrap. I had salmon bagel and it was a little soggy."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this einsteins, it is my favorite place to stop at in between dropping my kids off at soccer practice, piano lessons and everything in between! I have never had a bad experience here, which says a ton about this place! they have recently hired some new staff, whom which I adore. especially the little blonde gal she is quite the pleasure, always very friendly! quite frankly she reminds me of my niece... definitely give this place a shot if you are looking for a good quality bagel."}
{"text":"Meh, I just had a cream cheese blueberry bagel which came out as any Einsteins should be serving it. 

What I didn't like is that I went up and ordered with no line (sounds great if your flight is going to board soon right?) thinking it would be quick... Only to find out their were 6 orders waiting before mine! That's a little extensive for what should be quick turnaround considering you're serving people who are getting on flights. Okay, maybe I was being impatient? I don't think so, their were 3 employees and it seemed like only one was actually peeping the food which is why it was taking so long. One lady that had been waiting had to ask about her order and the gentleman apologized and said he would make it right away, as if they had forgotten or lost her order. 

Not to mention, a lot of their stuff is over priced like crazy... Almost $6 before tax for a medium or large chai latte?!?! No way I'm spending that much when even Starbucks doesn't charge that much for the same thing! 

Basically, if you've for the time and money, than it's worth a shot but nothing I recommend messing with."}
{"text":"Saddest bagel toppers ever
1/2 bagel burnt; other 1/2 had completely wilted arugula and green cored tomatoes. Yes, these Bagel Toppers are new items, but quality should never be this poor."}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service ever.  The employees would rather be doing anything, but helping customers.  They always have their back to the door and the counter, so they don't see when customers walk in, or when they are standing at the counter to order.
 I was there last week, and to walk into the restaurant, I had to walk by 2 employees taking their break outside of the store.  They were sitting at the tables (for customers) along with 4 other people, smoking  right next to the front door.  They were inches from the NO SMOKING sign issued to all chandler businesses, and were wearing their Einstein bagel uniforms.  This is so unprofessional.  
 You can definitely tell they do not enjoy their jobs.  The customer is not a priority to them, we as customers are more of a bother."}
{"text":"We've been here quite a few times but are finally giving up because they keep getting our order wrong.  Once or twice I could understand, but they have a really chronic problem."}
{"text":"I have gone to this location a couple of times a month because it is convenient but almost every time I do I grumble on my way out either because the manager has irritated me (again) with her lack of skills or they are out if whipped cream for the drink I order (again) but today was the final straw. The manager was there but a guy was waiting on people and every couple of minutes he would use his hand to wipe his nose and then wipe his hand on his pants. After doing this 3-4 times AND the fact that once again they didn't have any whipped cream, I am never going back to that store."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place!  Ever time I stop in, everyone is soooo nice.  They know my name and do everything with a smile! It's the best bagels I've ever had! I'll see you soon Einstein Bros!"}
{"text":"I have been in several Einstein Bagles across the valley, this one wins the award for lack of customer service, I was greeted with a blank stare from the gal at register, since it was early morning I stated \"good morning \" only a blank stare, and then a blurted out \"what can I get for you?\"
   Odd at best."}
{"text":"I've been going to this shop for the last 6-7 weeks. I get the same bagels every week. How do you screw up an order that's called in ahead of time but joy only that you remind the person taking the order to repeat the order back to you? How do you mess up a two bagel Oder? Either they're forgetful or incompetent, I'll go with the latter. Get it together EB off Flamingo/215"}
{"text":"You know, I don't mind going to a nice little place for lunch that turns out to be really busy. I usually just think to myself that the place must be really good to be so popular. However, when it gets that busy I usually look for clues that they have it under control. In a well managed location, you can usually spot the manager helping out and hustling around with the number one goal of getting that line moving. Well, not so at Einsteins near Desert Ridge. I stood there waiting and waiting and watching chaos unfold and seeing the confused expressions on the help staff's faces. After finally paying for my lunch I sat down and ate. The bagels are really good so my mood began to pick up. At that point I decided to go to the \"express coffee checkout\" to get some coffee. As soon as I got there I quickly realized that I was not going to get coffee. The cashier at this \"express\" checkout was helping everyone else who was buying bagels and lunch. They all just walked passed me like I was some idiot. At that point I heard someone behind me struggling with the soda fountain and then the cashier says to them with a giggle that they were all out of ice. Get some ice! I decided to just get out of there and instead I went to Albertsons to get my coffee, which was really good by the way."}
{"text":"This place is run by a bunch of incompetent retards. I NEVER get what I order, I always have to have them remake it. They are extremely disorganized. It takes forever to place your order because they are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  I only come here because of the location."}
{"text":"It's as if the staff have no training. Sooooo slow. Lineups are standard fair here. If your looking for a quick bite & coffee or you're in a hurry ... Stay away. Cashier would rather chat than move along the line. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Located inside the Hyatt across from convention center.  If you are waiting in that long line across the street at the convention center Starbucks....get out of line and come across the street.  Great coffee, bagels, fresh fruit cups, sandwiches, and drinks.  I really liked that it was always so well staffed as we headed down every morning when everyone else did!!"}
{"text":"Decent food. I try hard to like bagels more, but maybe i should just give up. Service here is hit or miss."}
{"text":"I love this einstieins, im a regular, I come at least 5 times a week and I get the same thing everytime so naturally the staff knows my order and I get in and out so fast I love it!! Not to mention how clean it is. I would recommend this location to anyone and I actually do, my friends and family tell me how much they enjoy it to!!"}
{"text":"Super slow service compared to other EBs. IlI go to the one on Sahara even though its 10 minutes out of the way next time."}
{"text":"Customer Service Abides! I lightly commented that this was the 3rd time I came in and they were out of Asiago bagels. We laughed at bad timing, then the counterman said, here is your schmear free of charge and your 3 signature bagels, because we have been out of your faves. Thanks to the E Bros!"}
{"text":"Good bagels, terrible service.  Sat and waited for my order for more than 10 minutes, this was an un-toasted bagel w/shmear.  Had to ask twice for my order as the three employees chatted & ignored the customers.  These three girls were useless.  
Morning of 6/22, before noon."}
{"text":"Having a good experience here is like playing the lotto. There's a chance it could happen to you but its rare but you hear about it happening to other people. Its passable enough when you don't want fast food. Its feast or famine when it comes to cream cheese- they'll put so much you can't taste the bagel... If you try to rectify and ask for lite or ask them to go easy on it- you get a see through layer of it on your order."}
{"text":"Zero selection. Our favorite Apple bagel is no longer available but instead it's a plain bagel with cinnamon sprinkled on top and no bagels are fluffy or the same anymore. They're no longer carrying plastic knives. And they're always out of bagels... MAKE MORE BAGELS!
Ps. You're a bagel shop so you should have some bagels... That aren't flat that is!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a Bagel with Lox and Cream Cheese on a Saturday or Sunday morning.  The only thing is they tend to run out of bagels as the morning moves on so get there early so you can have your pick..."}
{"text":"Service usually much better here but has dropped off recently. Seems they will throw anything at you just to see if you will take it. Always fix it when brought to their attention but quality control should be better on the front end."}
{"text":"They are awesome! Every time I enter their establishment I'm greeted by friendly employees and the food is excellent! Peter has been there eveytime I go to this location and he is such a gem! He is always so sweet and considerate after this last visit I just has to let everyone know! Good customer service is hard to find nowadays and they have got it going on!"}
{"text":"This place only survives because there's no better option close by, which in a great foodie neighborhood is embarrassing. Staff is too busy interacting with themselves to do their job and food is average at best. Someone please open a real bagel shop in Arcadia!"}
{"text":"The bagels are great, when they have them.
This was my 4th trip to this location in about two months.
This is the 3rd time they were out of bagels!
I went at 7:30am on a Monday, the place was busy.
I was hoping to get a dozen bagels (mostly plain), but theye were out. AGAIN!
I was told to come back in 30 minutes. Sure, no problem. It's not like I have a job to go to.

I hope somebody at Einstein Corporate reads these reviews & tells these people
to get their act together."}
{"text":"No bagels again!!!! Waste of time.  It doesn't matter what time u go.  Horrible customer service.  Back to Panera!"}
{"text":"I visited this location on 10/1/15 around 7:20am. I approached the counter to order and the employee clearly saw I was waiting to order yet she walked away to just stand around. She only returned to take my order when the manager told her to. She never said anything to me. She just simply stared at me until I initiated the order on my own! 

I ordered a bakers dozen of bagels which I have ordered many times at another location. I asked for a variety which, again, I have ordered many times at another location. She just looked at me and rolled her eyes, asked if i wanted them sliced, and started grabbing the bagels. She never said another word to me and just sat the bagels on top of the counter and turned her back. I grabbed the bagels and went to the cashier, who was thankfully polite to me, ordered my coffee, and left. 

When I got to work I opened the box to discover that I had only 3 different kinds of bagels. Plain, poppy seed, and blueberry. If you ask me, that's not really a variety especially when I have ordered this same thing in the past and received, wheat, plain, poppy seed, blueberry, Asiago and even everything bagels. Maybe they were doing me a favor all the other times I ordered, but maybe she should have specified instead of completely ignoring me. Worst customer service, ever. I will not visit this location again.

I didn't get the name of the girl who took my order but hopefully she can be identified by the time frame in which I was there."}
{"text":"This is the second time in the past couple months I've been to this Einsteins and it's more than great again. The fellas working this morning were awesome. I'm sure not too many guys are known for their hair this morning, but the man working today is the reason I'm going to keep coming back to this location. The guy is great...he definitely starts the day right. Thank you sir."}
{"text":"Very slow service every time I visit. The workers seem lost and untrained.  Why it takes more than 10 minutes to toast a bagel is beyond me...I am never happy with my experience and I work in the complex so it's frustrating that I can't get through that line in a quick manner at any visit, no matter the time of day..."}
{"text":"this is the best run Einstein bros bagel I have every been. I meet the owner the other day, store has friend staff, in super clean, and food is great, let all eat there thomas"}
{"text":"Remembering WHY I never come here. Never enough staff, and a line that goes all the way to the door and doesn't seem to move. Should you see this location and think to yourself \"I'm just gonna pop in and grab a quick bagel and schmear\" do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. Because you will be waiting in line for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I was in Einstein's on Saturday and tried to make my way around all the dogs both on the patio and inside the restaurant.  These were not tiny lap dogs or service dogs. They were virtually everywhere. When I got up to the counter I asked about all the dogs in the restaurant.  The clerk said \" yeah, there is nothing we can do about it\".  I love my dog too but I'm ok going out to a restaurant without him.  I love their bagels but I prefer them without dog hair. Additionally, this must be a health code violation."}
{"text":"This single location has completely turned me away from Einstein Brothers.  On the several occasions I have been there, I have encountered mediocre food and an incompetent staff.  If you are a fan of this chain, avoid this location."}
{"text":"Einstein Bagels has really gone down the drain.  My order seems to always get messed up.  The quality and service are terrible.  And they close at 4.  Really?"}
{"text":"I went to get a couple bagels w cream cheese on a Sunday at 2pm and there was very few selctions left. Only 1 sweet (apple cinnamon) and 3 others. I ordered 2 of the apple cinnamon w cream cheese to go and paid 7 dollars for the 2. When I got home I opened the bag and saw a pretty sad amount of cream cheese on both bagels. Who wants to eat a bagel w barely any cream cheese spread and parts of it had no cream cheese. Used to be a goood spot but def gone down hill..."}
{"text":"They've got to work on efficiency. There's no reason for it taking 15min for one (1) sandwich with 2-3ppl on an assembly line...only for me to get the wrong sandwich. The farmhouse comes with cheesy hash brown bagel, where'd the plain come from? ?"}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times in hopes they get better but they don't. 3 out of 3 times messed my order up. Unfortunately they are closest Einstein's to me so in stuck. I have been to others and they are much faster and don't tend to mess up orders quite like this location."}
{"text":"This Einstein was a terrible experience. I waited 20 minutes in line to find out every bagel that I wanted was out. They had less then half of the bagel flavors available.  The girl behind the counter was completely rude and wasn't helpful in finding a solution to the problem. I ended up just leaving without breakfast.  I will never go there again. Where are all of the Brueggers?!"}
{"text":"I frequent this location once a week and every time I visit it is filthy.  They definitely need to step up their cleaning.  Plus they never have hot water for tea.  I just don't understand it.  The staff seem to be indifferent to their jobs and are friendly.  Food is decent enough.  Just clean the place!"}
{"text":"Went to this location this morning.   Worst experience ever.  We live 2 minutes away, but would drive to central Phx for breakfast.   It took 47 minutes to get our food I had plain bagel with plain egg whites & my husband had a panini which they messed up.  If all of us wouldn't have ordered we all would have walked out. They were very low staffed & were messing up so many orders.  The only bagel place in Cave Creek and it won't be visited anymore!!"}
{"text":"This location needs help.  The customer service and lack of cleanliness needs to be their focus.  They seem to take too long, so sometimes I end up just walking next door to Coffee Bean because they are way quicker.  Unfortunately, Coffee Bean doesn't have Vanilla Hazelnut Coffee :/  Every time I go it's something new...they are out of the coffee flavor I like, the person at the register doesn't say hi - just expects me to start rattling off my order like I'm a mind reader, every table is open but NONE of them are wiped off, the floor is full of trash and all the trash cans are full.  These are easy fixes and I hate to see a good bagel and coffee shop go to waste."}
{"text":"The only reason i patron this place is because it's literally across the street & the bagels & coffee are good. otherwise the staff is not spectacular, especially one of the female managers. The manager, i don't know her name but she looks to be hispanic. She's VERY rude when she screws up & you call her on it. Yet, she screws up my order literally EVERY single time. Maybe she should become more competent. Heaven forbid i want my order to be correct. If you don't like your job, leave lady."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff are super friendly and helpful, not to mention, their bagels and other breakfast food are freshly baked. Oh, did I mention that they have much better tasting cafe mocha? Well, their mocha is the best I've tasted compared to their next door competitor and won't mention names."}
{"text":"It's always hit and miss. Every time I get lox they either give me a white unripe tomato or barely any lox. Today it was both. I am done with this place."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm not being fair by writing this because I grew up in NYC, across from a real Jewish bagel shop where they retarded, boiled, then baked the bagels in the true NYC style, but I have to be honest.  Yes that's how they are really made, and the clerk told me they are not retarded and boiled at Einstein's, at least not at this particular location.  So began my first visit to Einstein's a few months ago.

My first order was an 'everything' bagel, untoasted, and served with vegetable cream cheese.  The bagel was okay.  It did not have the shiny crust and chewy taste of a really good bagel.  And the cream cheese spread---hmm---amounted to almost nothing. Right,  there was almost no cream cheese in the bagel sandwich.  It didn't have even a quarter inch of cream cheese. It was spread on like a thin peanut butter.  That is NOT how it's done.  The cream cheese should be visible from the side of the bagel, and I think it should be served open-face as it does not say \"sandwich\" on the menu.  Put two sides of a bagel together and it becomes a sandwich. Abysmal.  The coffee was good, though--hot, fresh,aromatic, and of good quality.

After a  number of months I returned here.  It's right down the  street from my house. and I decided to try it again. The second time I ordered a pumpernickel bagel, untoasted, with lox spread.  Again the bagel was mediocre and looked like a deflated tire on my plate, smashed together with a tiny bit of cheese, like a glutinous cream-starved Oreo.  And, again, the decaf was very good.

Ambiance? So-so, but that wasn't too important to me. What I wanted was a sincere effort at a  replication of a NYC bagel.  I knew it wouldn't be an exact replication, but it could have been a lot better,  I wish Einstein's would at least try to make a decent bagel,and be more generous with the filling. This place might satisfy non-native New Yorkers who've never had the real deal, but I was thoroughly disappointed. Maybe the other menu items are better, but that would be like going into a steakhouse and ordering a fish platter instead of meat."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Einstein Bros Bagels, and I'd probably visit every morning if one was a bit closer to my house. But when did it become so pricey? Einstein was an old college hangout, and I had very little money back then. So why is it that, now, when I'm a filthy rich public school teacher, breakfast here is emptying my wallet?"}
{"text":"All I can say is yuck. I expect a lot from chain/franchises. Maybe the food won't be the highest quality, but the service and cleanliness should be right on. And it should be fast.
I went here a couple of times and was dissapointed every single time. The last time I went, I got a bagel with cream cheese for take out. I got home and started eating it and, would you believe it, it tasted like cigarettes!! Clearly, whoever made it had just been smoking, came back inside, and made my food without washing their hands!!!! Respulsive, I didn't even bother to go back to complain.
I will never give Einsteins my business again.
Looking through Yelp, I see a ton of bad reviews about all of the Einsteins. You would think corporate would take these reviews from the general population into some serious consideration. We may not be official food critics, but we do know what is going on."}
{"text":"I came here on the morning of the 26th and the store was pretty full, like 50% probably. There were three people in line in front of us. I ordered three drinks and four bagels for my family. We were headed out to LA since we came to visit extended family and relatives.

We had left early around 9 AM in order to try and avoid too much traffic and thought a quick bagel stop was going to be okay. WE WERE WRONG.

It took them 25 minutes to fulfill this order. 25 MINUTES FOR A TO GO ORDER, of bagels and coffee. They were so SLOW and focused on the people eating in instead of the TO go orders. When we got out food, the bagels were soggy and the lattes were cold. It was really freaking depressing because I used to love Einsteins. 

Bad customer service and products."}
{"text":"Decided to come in again and give it another chance today, since this location is on my way to work. While there was a greater variety of bagels then there used to be, the lack of customer service is hard to ignore. A smile, a simple \"thank you\" and \"you're welcome\" or a \"have a great day!\" goes a long way... Something many employees here seem to forget. Only employee who seems to be remotely friendly to me when I go in is the girl with long blonde hair. Will be going to the Ray and Rural location from now on."}
{"text":"First time here, since we stayed at the hotel next door. Didn't read the reviews, but my experience was the same as many other wrote: It is *really* slow and disorganized! Get some manegement!

25 minutes for 2 bagels, and they first forgot the coffee and then the order. Clearly, other people were waiting as well. Long lines, being handled inefficiently."}
{"text":"Easy to find location, timely & friendly service,  tasty bagel sandwiches, strong coffee & a generous military discount. I'll definitely be coming back! Free wifi and ample seating, perfect for a study session or conversations."}
{"text":"I love Einstein Bros! Only been to a few locations in the Valley but this one is my favorite. They always seem to have every type of bagel in stock when I go. Compared to other locations I've been to, the service here is friendly and fast. From past experiences I've noticed that customer service at EBB is pretty hit-or-miss, but every time I come in to this location I'm greeted with a smile. Good way to start my day!"}
{"text":"This location is awful! HORRIBLE customer service. Not one employee smiled at us or greeted us. After we already ordered they told us that they were out of the pumpkin shmear, (which is the only reason we went) and we told them that we would like a refund and we will go to a different location. They rudely gave us a refund and while we were walking out told us that the pumpkin season was over and would not find it anywhere else. Why would they not inform us of this before we ordered and before our refund. Not to mention that advertisement of the pumpkin items are located all over their store. Because of their extremely poor customer service, we will never be returning to this location, and I suggest you save yourself from a bad mood and find a different location as well."}
{"text":"There were at least 6 people working and five customers in the store including me, however the place looked as if no one had bothered cleaning it since the day before.  The coffee counter was filthy with spilled milk, sugar, straws, crumbs and other debris.  All of the tables were dirty and when I asked one of them to please clean off the table for me, it took a long time because no one could find a rag to clean the tables with.  In the meantime, they came to deliver the food and I said I was waiting for the table to be cleaned and the worker put the food on the dirty table.  I was revolted and will never go into an Einstein Bros store again"}
{"text":"The slowest grossest I've ever been to avoid this place.  Aside from how long it took they got the order wrong while the manager stood around playing on his phone.  There were only 20 people waiting to get their orders.  Horrible"}
{"text":"Here with my dog and girlfriend for a nice Saturday morning breakfast. Very good bagel and coffee. Staff is very professional and nice. Sort of feels like a local coffee shop even though it's a chain. My dog especially likes licking the bagel bag and drinking the fine water."}
{"text":"Very good food here but it gets way too crowded. But the staff keeps up as best they can.  The coffees are top notch and I love all the bagels they have.  I recommend getting there early cause hey get busy shortly after they open."}
{"text":"Staff is not the most attentive nice bunch. How is it possible to what over 10 min for a coffee cake and a coffee? When other customers recieved the wrong order the staff was belittling and ingored customer requests. Also it can't be sanitary to microwave ham with a muffin. Gross."}
{"text":"I have not been in for a while - what a shock!  The place is dirty, the folks working there can't say hello, turn away when you are at the counter.  Only coffee is decaf and some vanilla flavor, milk & half and half are empty, no sugar, counter is filthy.  Are you serious about selling those black bananas?"}
{"text":"This is the third time going to Einsteins on the weekend and was met with an egregious wait.  This was due to poorly trained cashiers and inadequate staff.  It took over 15 minutes from entering the door for a simple bagel.  On top of that my order came out wrong and had to be corrected. 

Suffice to say I will no longer be going back to this establishment.  Advice to management: invest on training your staff and hire more people for the weekend morning rush."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday morning around 8:45 AM.
Experience was a lot different from the weekend mornings.
One person ahead of me.
Garlic bagel with Onion and Chive spread.
Maybe I was REALLY hungry but it was Delicious!
Try the strawberry spread on a plain bagel too, its so pink and tastes yummy too."}
{"text":"This has got to be the dirtiest place I've been. The staff is run horribly. The trash is over flowing behind the counter and the PM special for $5 is horrible. The staff was all wearing dirty shirts. My wife and I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I was a customer that went to this Einstein's 1-2 xs a week, and bought a dozen bagels every week. For the last 2 years, I have boycotted this place. I haven't stepped a foot in this Einsteins for 2 years. I will NEVER go back again.  
I had seen it all with the HORRIBLE workers there. Bad attitudes... ignoring customers... taking a break out back for 10 min while I was standing there, and they knew I was there... getting the orders wrong... smashing my bagels, because they CONSISTENTLY REFUSE to use the bagel cutter, because the excuse is, \"it's already been cleaned\"... nasty attitudes... being told they were out of bagels, and they wouldn't bake anymore (when I wanted to buy a dozen)... bagels are consistently different sizes, and very small compared to all the other Einstein's I have been to... 
I had called and spoken to the manager to complain of the issues with the workers, and it was basically blown off. The thing that finally did it for me was when I went in (the last time I ever stepped foot in there). The Hispanic looking guy who always looked like he hated everyone, and looked like he was going to snap and go on a shooting spree, started threatening me. 
He started with his nasty attitude, and said the bagel cutter was already cleaned, and closed down. I told him how I had spoken to the manager, and he said they shouldn't be closing down the bagel cutter at noon. He started threatening me. I ran out of the store shaking. No one expects to go buy bagels, and have it turn into that. It was a horrendous experience. I called the Complaint line, and holding back tears, I told the lady the whole story. She couldn't believe it. She said she was going to have the regional manager call me.
I will tell you this---there is something wrong with the management. When I talked to the regional manager lady, she did not seem to really care. No concern that their employee threatened a customer?? She \"appeased\" me by sending me a couple of coupons for a free bagel sandwich. 
Bottom line: I am convinced by what I saw, that the workers (all young) definitely have to be on drugs, or something....And, for some unknown reason, upper management does not care AT ALL. There is something wrong with this place. I have never seen anything like it. AVOID this nightmare place. If you have to get bagels, go to Paradise Bakery/Panera on Ray and the 101, or go to the Einstein's on Ray and Rural-their bagels are fresh, huge, and the people are normal. Don't reward this place with your business."}
{"text":"Love the bagels and smear! Don't order a sandwich to go though bc it'll take forever. Customer service is still on par though!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I used to love Einstein's. I've been to this location before without problems, but this trip has confirmed my belief that all of the locations seem to be suffering in quality...for a while now. 

Unfortunately, my usual location is currently undergoing renovations so I went to this one instead. I purchased two nova lox bagels and two doggy bagels. I think the recipe or bake time was off for the plain bagels because they were sunken and doughy. The smoked salmon tasted incredibly fishy and was actually warm to the touch. For fear of food poisoning, I didn't eat it. Total waste of money, but I didn't go back to return the items since I really wasn't interested in being inconvenienced any further. I'll be avoiding this location without a doubt and I'll look into different local bagel shops."}
{"text":"The service was friendly, helpful, and the food and drinks were perfect. Cathy was extremely helpful with menu navigation. I will definitely visit again soon:]"}
{"text":"Crap service. Wrong bagel. Couldn't even remember what I asked for.  What else can I say????"}
{"text":"Very slow service and I don't know how they can run out of PLAIN bagels! Luckily, I like their food so I keep going back ...."}
{"text":"Although I like this place, a few things happened today that were unacceptable. First, as a line developed and one girl was serving, preparing and working register, their other employee was sweeping the floor (wasn't that dirty) oblivious to the line etc..
Then while I prepared my coffee she was sweeping practically between my legs with a large industrial broome. Just before I prepared coffee I set my newspaper on a table and when I was done I returned to table and it was gone. To her credit the sweeper apologized. So she then told me they are closing at 3pm (it was 1pm when this all happened.) I am hoping this was just a bad day as I really do like it here."}
{"text":"I love bagels so I continue to go here, but the service isn't very good. The ONLY time receive exceptional service is when the smaller kid (I think he is a manager) is the one helping me. He's the only reason my review isn't getting 1 star. If all the employees were like him, it would likely be a 5 star review"}
{"text":"they never have green Chile bagels, if they go so fast it only makes sine to make more !"}
{"text":"Today I went to Einstein Bagels at Chandler to leave twice completely unsatisfied with both the service at the front, service in the store and level or quality of food provided. 
I went in and ordered a bakers dozen of assorted variety, asked for them cut. Nothing else. Only to seem as if I was inconveniencing the lives of whomever was pushing the register for my order. I didn't want anything hot, toasted or prepared because I simply wanted to do so myself. Well I get home, only to find 6 out of my 12 bagels destroyed in what was some failed attempt to place them in the box gently. Along with the oils completely soaking through to the others. The bagels were mangled and 100% unable to toast them of any sort. My specialty bagel sandwich was the same, \"toasted\" but cold and soggy. 
I called the manager to express my situation and frustration of paying $30 on my breakfast between the bagels, schemers & sandwiches to be offered a fix when I come back in. 
When I went back in with everything but the drinks, I couldn't get the bagels I wanted. Not even plain. They weren't available. Nor could I simply get a refund. So I'm out, you win Einstein Bagel of Chandler. A multi-million dollar producing company got me, as I threw away my bagels in the store an walked out. I'm sure no one cared. They never do, there should be a level of customer service and pride in a persons position. Or at minimum, don't get a job you're gonna be complete unhappy with."}
{"text":"On Tuesday August 30th, I ordered a bagel sandwich and a hazelnut coffee. While ordering the coffee, the cashier screwed up my order and charged me for a hazelnut mocha. The cashier called me a liar. To be fair, a crazy lady was next to me screaming about her order and she could have miss heard me. I corrected her and another cashier said they would fix my order and only charge me the $9.52 not the $12.52 that they charged. Now I checked my bill and it is $12.52 on my card. And these people want $15.00 an hour."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service. I got a bagel with plain cream cheese, only to receive orange colored something all over my bagel. My husband went to the counter to show them & they said, ok we will make a new one. The 2nd bagel was toasted & shouldn't of been & the orange stuff was all over that one too. Very messy, cream cheese all over."}
{"text":"Past experiences have been okay, nothing spectacular. There's some nice employees, but mostly rude, unhappy employees. The past 2 visits were probably enough for me to finally make a commitment to a new store (Robert at the Ray and Rural store is amazing). But at the McClintock and Guadalupe store there's a short dark haired woman always there to greet you with a scowl, and a man Gina that has terrible customer service. I decided to try the garlic & herb smear which was so disgusting, and had the worst texture, so I asked to exchange it for the one I shoulvde gotten in the first place. But Gina was making unnecessary remarks and laughing because we bought the tub on Monday, unfortunately opened and tried it on Wednesday, and came in Saturday because it was Thanksgiving and Black Friday. We even wasted two bagels because my sister and I didn't think we had to try it first, and he says we used almost half the tub. AND four weeks prior to this, we asked for 5 cranberry bagels and they gave us 5 cinnamon raisin instead. How does that even happen?!? #LookOutForTheManGina"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times for lunch/breakfast and every time they mess my order up. I get the same bagel so Idk how many times they can get it wrong. I got a bagel toasted and it wasn't, gotten the wrong cream cheese (I always get the salmon shmear), and once I got a Nova Lox with two small pieces of salmon. I mentioned that to them the next time I ordered another Nova Lox (different day) about how I got that last time and it looked nothing like the picture they display on the order board. I told them I wanted it to match the amount of salmon on there and not with minimal pieces of salmon. They said yes to that so I waited. Within the time from my order to I got my bagel, they asked me if I wanted it toasted (they have a computer in which they place the order for crying out loud), what kind of cream cheese again, and when I finally went through all that trouble I still got what seemed nothing for salmon on my bagel also the wrong cream cheese. I will NOT be going back to this location and one more thing too; the people in here were/are rude to me every single time. Until they get new crew members (or a better personality for each person that was rude to me) I will be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have always liked Einstein Bros Bagels; their \"Veg Out\" bagel sandwich is one of my favorite vegetarian sandwiches and their bagels are always delicious.  

I have gone to this Einstein location twice early in the morning to get a baker's dozen and two \"Joe to Go\" coffee containers to provide breakfast at a presentation.  Both times I did not call ahead of time but each time the staff was quick, helpful, and kind.  I was worried they would have trouble accommodating my order since I basically walked in the door without notice but they had no issues.  They provide creamer, sweeteners, stirrers, coffee cups, and knives for the cream cheese.  They have a great system so that everything is organized and you have everything you need.  I also appreciated that they helped me bring the bagels and coffee out to my car.  

The only downside is that the bakers dozen, two containers of cream cheese, and two big things of coffee (one regular and one decaf) came to $50 which is not cheap.  However, they have great quality food and coffee and when you think about all the extras they throw in, it is actually a pretty reasonable price.  I would recommend going to Einstein for anyone who needs a last minute spread for a conference or presentation!"}
{"text":"Hello fellow yelpers!!! Today I was asked to never return to the Einstein's on 16th st and camelback for protecting my girlfriend (which is a now a former employee at that location).  She has been a victim of bullying by the her co-workers, including managers ,and shift leaders for the past 6 months. Yes! They treat their own workers with disrespect. I feel like I'm on a middle school campus when I'm there. I honestly believe my girlfriend  brought good customer service skills which brought repeat business to a place that already had a bad reputation ( look at the other reviews) .  Most of the customers that came in ,confused this place for the Starbucks next door.  Because the employees are so rude and unprofessional, Once they realized that were in the wrong place, they left immediately. I suggest you avoid this place wheather if your a hungry customer, or unemployed looking for a job.."}
{"text":"You should go anywhere else to get a bagel - don't waste your time stopping at this location. I've been here 3 times in the last 2 months after moving to the neighborhood, and this location of Einstein Bagels keeps getting worse. Odds are they won't have the bagels you want when you walk in, or if they do they'll \"run out\" before your order is completed.

Einstein, how do you run out of bagels? YOU HAVE ONE JOB! If you're out of a specific type of bagel by mid-morning today (and last weekend, and the one before, etc.), why not go ahead and close for the day when you start running out instead of disappointing all of us? We'll know you are out because the door is locked and won't waste our time waiting in line for you to fail again. Also, I'm pretty sure your bagels aren't handcrafted by some old-world artisan in the back of the store - you're effectively a fast-food restaurant even if this location doesn't have a drive-thru, so why do you not order/make more bagels for next time if you run out on a consistent basis? People go out for breakfast on the weekends and might sleep late before they go out, so why are you out of anything before noon on a Saturday or Sunday?

A few weeks ago I stopped in for a sick friend who had requested either an asiago cheese bagel or an everything bagel...the customer in front of me ordered the last asiago cheese bagel in the bin, and they were out of everything bagels. I walked out and bought our breakfast elsewhere. It was a Saturday morning at 10:15 am, so I'm sure we weren't the last people not to get what we came to Einstein for that day.

The visit today looked more promising because I saw 2 asiago cheese bagels in the bin when I got in line. They were out of pretzel bagels and down to 1 apple cinnamon bagel, 1 potato bagel, and 2 Spinach Florentine bagels, so other people would soon be disappointed and have to get something else...but not me, not today! Both asiago cheese bagels were still there 5 minutes later when I made it through the long line and ordered, and the woman taking orders seemed to remember me from my last failed visit and thanked me for coming back. I went to the other end, paid, and waited for about 5 more minutes before someone behind the counter flagged me down to tell me they were now out of asiago cheese bagels and what would my second choice be? I asked for the manager's name and number, and the girl at the checkout counter cheerfully pointed and said \"she's right there.\" I asked for the owner's name and number instead, thinking that the manager either must be in on the supply problem or just too incompetent to notice it, and the counter girl kinda shrugged and gave me a blank look. The counter girl refunded my money and hollered to the woman taking orders at the other end to \"start watching her bagels,\" so I was only out the 10 minutes wasted and the same disappointment from my last visit. It was 9:45 am - so much for coming in earlier. It was strange though...no one from Einstein seemed to think that it was unusual to ask a customer for their second choice, so maybe everyone else who comes here just has lowered expectations and goes along with it?  :(

I had previously considered going to the next closest Einstein location for asiago cheese bagels, even though it would be several miles away. After today, I realized that we all deserve a more sustainable bagel solution with better customer service. When I find it, I'll let you know...in the meantime, you're better off going to Safeway next door for your bagels."}
{"text":"We are from out of town, but always stop here when visiting. The bagels and mochas are delicious, and the employees are always friendly and welcoming. The food is good, but the customer service is what makes this place our go-to breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Super excellent bagel. Cinnamon sugar or pretzel YUM. Try the strawberry / banana smoothie! Run out early so get there early!"}
{"text":"Been going here over 9 years.  It's gone down over the years.  Not clean (look at floor where bagels are prepared).  The young female manager is great and proactive but the employees seem demotivated as the coffee is watery (frequently empty) and the bagels are sloppily prepared.  I switched over to the new Einsteins on Pinnacle & Scottsdale Road and it is excellent.  New, clean, great coffee and meticulous bagels making."}
{"text":"I just stop at Einstein's for the coffee, so I can't comment on the bagels.  I don't mind waiting in line to pay, as long as a motivated cashier is working through it.  What grinds my gears about this Einsteins is that when there's not a line the cashier disappears into the back room, leaving four or five other people standing around and watching me wait several minutes to pay for an effing cup of coffee.  No one says a damn thing.  No one says, \"hey the cashier will be back in a minute\", or \"hey cashier!  There's a jerk here who just wants coffee, can you come take his money?\"  Perhaps adding insult to injury, they have a sign that says \"coffee express line\", what the hell does that mean if no one's there to take your money.

But the good news for me is that there's an Einstein's in North Scottsdale by my office, so I go there now.  They get it, the cashier never leaves the area, so it's always a quick turnaround."}
{"text":"I literally have had THE worst customer service EVER.. ANYWHERE! the staff is just flat out rude. I came in with my two children.. nobody greeted me.. when I said hi, this girl said \"what are you getting?\" The man on the food prep line was awful too..i smiled and asked how his day was going.. nothing. He turned away from me and looked so pissed to be there. As I'm juggling my two babies I hear the man in food prep yell my name.  Luckily i even heard him.. We were sitting on the patio and happened to come in for napkins! I have never been to a location where the food isn't brought to your table and there was NOBODY in line either! I had to ask if somebody could help me carry all 6 baskets to my table.. in response, the girl at the register huffed under her breath and snatched two baskets off the counter, nearly spilling my food, and without saying anything sprinted for the front door and kicked it open nearly knocking another woman over that was on her way in. She threw my food on the table and as she walked away I yelled, \"thank you!\" And nothing.. I'm appalled this location is still open and I'm furious that I even spent a dime here!"}
{"text":"Our breakfast sandwiches were AMAZING! Had the \"Peppered Bacon Melt\" and the \"Bacon Spinach Egg\" sandwiches. Both were delicious. Bagels were toasted just right. Only gave 4 stars instead of 5 due to the extremely unfriendly host/manager. I realize everyone has bad days and deals with bad things in their lives but when you work in a customer service position you need to put on a smile anyway. This girl bugged her eyes out at me while I ordered as tho I was wasting her time. There was only one other customer in line. I smiled and continued to be friendly with nothing in return. Hopefully she finds something to be happy about!"}
{"text":"By far the worst bagel shop in town. 3 weeks in a row now we have shown up before 10 am and they are out of everything. What good is a breakfast shop that is out of food before breakfast."}
{"text":"No salads... No regular cream cheese.. That counts out lunch for me I won't be stoping back. Girl was less then pleasant."}
{"text":"I buy these bagels for my employees a lot and this location is convenient for me to go to. If I had another option I would, the customer service is TERRIBLE. I have not had one good experience here."}
{"text":"Bad service. Very unorganized.  As soon as we walked in the door 4 people front the front disappeared to the back and we waited for 10min until someone come out and I know they saw us we made eye contact."}
{"text":"Been to several of these on other trips and they are always good.  Bagels were the same good quality but none of our three bagels were warm.  I got the egg sandwich and the cheese didn't even melt.  We will try it again on this trip and I'll update if there is any difference the next time."}
{"text":"I get the same exact sandwich every time, but about half of the time they get my order wrong!!!  It's annoying...they either give me the wrong bagel or don't give me double egg white (which they charge me for) or put cheese when I ask for no cheese....it's not rocket science people!  lol  So I stopped going here even though it's the closest to me"}
{"text":"Seems like a few of these locations do not have the spinach bagel as they're sold out pretty quickly. I wonder why they don't make extra in those types of bagels? Maybe they're too understaffed to notice. It's tough to go to these stores to see just 2 workers trying to run the operations of the entire store. It's really hard on them and the customers have to get bad service because of it. I don't blame the workers but management need to pay attention to this. I really love the bagels here but the bad service is a lot to deal with."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for cream cheese, but the downside to this place is the service. A smile can go far... much further than a cup of joe and a cheese bagel."}
{"text":"Great assortment available! Great place for lunch. Highly recommended. 5 stars. The egg bagel with vegetable with cream cheese is delicious."}
{"text":"Had a layover in Las Vegas and immediately saw the Einstein Bagels outside the gate I arrived in. Was kind of in a rush to get to my connecting flight on the other side of the airport, but had time. 

I ordered an everything bagel with plain cream cheese and tomato. I moved over to wait and watched as everyone that ordered before me and just after me received their orders. I went to the barista to get my order filled. She was very kind and walked to the bagel line to tell them what she needed. But she whispered something. Didn't sit well. First flag. When she gave it to me, she rolled up the bag though she hadn't done that for any of the other orders. Again, flag.

As I walked away I had the feeling that I should look in the bag, but didn't know where I was going and thought I should focus. Well, when I made it to my connecting gate, I was sorely disappointed to see that I had nearly NO cream cheese. Thinking that maybe they limit their cheese, I just started to eat is, but it was STALE! Not toasted... Like it was old... 

Ruined my travel day. Already stressed and tired... Definitely didn't need that today. I don't recommend this stop. Go to Starbucks..."}
{"text":"Terrible experience!!!  We wait in the Q under the sing \" order here\" for a min or so, the employees looking at us but don't tell us to go put our order where the\" pay here\" sing, we buy coffee and bagels with strawberry  , 3 of the coffee machine flavor was cold coffee, and when we receive the bagels it was with pinnate better inside!!! We go to Einstein on Durango Rd ,we never had such bad experience before!!!! I understand way the place is empty at after noon time..."}
{"text":"Wait was OK. Cashier was friendly, happy & full of energy!  All other employees flat to costumers but energetic to each other. My order was wrong wanted for here but put in a bag, no lettuce but got it. All around OK."}
{"text":"I would have to agree with some of the others that the staff is the only issue I see at this place. I came to this place seven times and the only issue I ever see is the staff. One time I came in and literally 1 person was working taking orders, preparing the food and cashing people out, poor guy. The bagels are sometimes burnt but not too bad. All in all its not too bad of a place, just plan to wait a little while for you food. Train the staff better and get more staff and this is a 5 star place."}
{"text":"We needed something like Einstein in this area.  The staff is friendly, the food is delish and the patio lends itself to some great people watching!  Great place for lunch.  I didn't know Einstein Brothers did more than bagels."}
{"text":"Well, I figured what happened to me today was a fluke accident, but after reading the other reviews, I have concluded that the staff here needs some serious food handling training.

I ordered a Tasty Turkey sandwich, no mods, with a fruit cup and a brownie. First mistake (good, IMO, although useless): they accidentally gave me two brownies. NBD, I'll just pass the freebie on to my co-worker. 

Second mistake (bad) gets a bit more disturbing. I'm about halfway through my sandwich when I bite into something I can't chew through. Look at the sandwich and end up pulling out a big, long chunk of PLASTIC WRAP from in between the (browning, wilted) lettuce and the schmear. I double-checked the ingredients list for the sandwich, just to be sure, and nope, no listing of plastic wrap. I'm also pretty positive that stuff would be no Bueno to try to digest. 

The final insult: the fruit cup is mostly honeydew. Just a PSA: nobody actually wants to eat honeydew. Don't call it a \"fruit cup\" if it's all melon. 

Overall, I've always loved Einstein's but this was my first time having it in a few years, first time for lunch, and first time at this location. I highly doubt I'll return to this one, unless somehow they hire and train their staff to be competent and AWARE."}
{"text":"The sandwich I order is really good but 75% of the time they make it wrong, which is frustrating. Sometimes I go in and order a sandwhich and they act like Im speaking another language and say \"we dont have that sandwhich\" and I turn to the menu and have to point it out. Which is ironic since its called einsteins. The food is good but they really need to train thee people better, and have a better system for food pickup since you have to wait awkwardly at the drink area. Its a bummer because I always want to go there but then I have to worry about getting the right order..."}
{"text":"This Einstein's gets a 5 for take out service. I always order 4-5 dozen sliced bagels with very specific flavors to pick up around 7:30. Every time they have been ready; Terri is especially helpful, always asking if I need plates for the group and having the napkins and knives already in the bag. They are always friendly."}
{"text":"Not really what I had expected... priced high for some breakfast sandwiches and they were mediocre.. would rather eat their bagels, which is what they are known for, definitely not their sandwiches."}
{"text":"I agree with many of the other one and two star reviews here. I frequent quite a few different Einstein's locations in the Valley, as I am all over the Valley for work. This one is the worst.

I went in today midday and found that I was the only customer ordering (with a few people already served and eating). I ordered from the first line (where they take your order) my \"usual\"- cinnamon sugar bagel toasted with honey butter and cinnamon sugar on top. There were 4 employees on the \"line\", one taking my order, one putting paper in baskets by where you pay, and another one restocking the self-serve chiller in the middle. I proceeded to move over to the \"paying\" line and sat there as the employee putting paper in the basket just looked at me, not acknowledging that I was waiting to pay. The lady restocking the chiller (who was the only decent employee I had during this visit) came over and said that someone would be right with me. Nobody came to ring me up, so she went to the back and got someone to ring me up. I filled up my drink and turned around to see my bagel JUST going into the toaster, as 4 employees on the line talked and kidded with each other. My bagel popped out of the toaster and Zach (I found out his name later when I called to complain) took the bagel out of the toaster and set it on the counter. He then turned to a fellow employee and started chatting with him. When there was a break in the conversation, he spread butter on my bagel. It was apparently one of the employees' last day and she was leaving work. So Zach stopped making my bagel to say goodbye to her and chat with her before she left. All my bagel needed was cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top...as I sat there and waited. 

I finally stepped up and said, \"Hey guys, can I get my bagel? I have been waiting for a bit.\" Zach turned to me and replied \"You have only been waiting for 3 minutes and 51 seconds.\" Obviously, this didn't sit well with me, so I responded, \"Well there are a bunch of you standing around doing nothing and I am the only customer in here\". He finally gave me my bagel and I left.

I called later and spoke with the shift manager who clearly remembered me. He explained to me that he would \"talk to\" Zach about his inappropriate/disrespectful response to me and that they are the 4th busiest Einstein's in the Valley. Funny, because I have been to busier locations who served me quicker and treated me with respect. Calling and speaking with the manager didn't accomplish much, so I will be calling corporate (1-800-BAGEL ME for anyone else who needs it).

IN SUMMARY: long wait times, employees standing around not helping customers (like the other reviews), bad traffic flow, disrespectful employees

THE ONLY GOOD THING GOING for this place was the bagel was decent...hence the one star.

I wonder how many people/reviews saying the same thing it is going to take before the store manager and corporate step in?"}
{"text":"Don't know why I continue to go to Einstein. Must be because my kids like the potato bagels so much.   I will have to agree that they are pretty good - doughy and yummy toasted w/ cream cheese.  As for the other bagels, they don't compare to \"real\" NY bagels.  I keep searching for something healthy on the menu but cannot find it.  I ordered a turkey sandwich on a thin bagel.  It was alright, but the service at this Einstein was undesirable. It took the help 15 minutes to get out one toasted bagel and the turkey sandwich.  Not too many customers and 4 employees trying to assemble a sandwich. I wanted to jump behind that counter and show them how it's done!"}
{"text":"The wait to order is always long and no problem for me. But waiting to pay because no one comes to ring me up is frustrating. There were six people working on making bagels and no one on the register. My bagels were ready before anyone bothered to ring me up. Furthermore, I ordered to eat there and they still made it to go. 

There is only one high chair and very rarely anywhere to sit."}
{"text":"Always Great Bagels!  So many different flavors and smear combinations, you could literally eat bagels for months and not have the same bagel. And that's just the bagels, they have sandwiches and pastries too!

Try the salmon smear on the jalapeno bagel, it' wonderful!

Great coupons in the paper too!"}
{"text":"Service is slow and taste is inconsistent... They're always crowded and have a hard time finding my order..."}
{"text":"This location used to be nice, service has gone down hill big time. Employee looked at me like I interrupted his day when he came to take my order, the two at the cashier were not about to stop their conversation and when my order was up, I was given my food in a cream cheese covered bag. I thought it was maybe an anomaly but the next two guests had the same experience and one of them complained. Without a word the employee got another bag for the guest. Not impressed."}
{"text":"There are open again. Tried to check in but Yelp wouldn't let me. Sad to say they don't have their famous black berry lemonade anymore."}
{"text":"My visit in regards to food and drink was good, as expected. What was unexpected was the unpleasant cashier who worked this morning. She had a very rude tone to the previous customer who was simply asking about why the screen was showing a price listing items he didn't purchase. That negative experience continued on to me with the first words being \"what did you get?!\" which might have well been \"what do you want?!!\" I ate inside and she did not smile once at the long line of customers that followed. Unfortunate experience that translated to dozens of customers not getting good customer service - or maybe that's her normal attitude."}
{"text":"Without a doubt this is the worst Einsteins I've been to.  The food is pretty consistent - when they get it right, which isn't often, but the customer service is the problem.  Went there this morning, not a lot of people there, 1 gal in front of me...she was waiting, waiting...looked at me and said \"This has happened 3 times at this place - 3 strikes and they're out\" and she left.  They got to me a few minutes later, took my order.  Took @ 10 minutes to get 2 bagels, nothing fancy, 2 toasted bagels.  I got a fountain drink, which they were out of, so I told they guy the coke was out.  He said ok and promptly went outside to smoke.  Didn't know it was so stressful to ask to assistance that he needed a break!  Told the other guy after my order was up and he said ok.  Then he started helping other people (1 of whom was a girl whose order was wrong)...finally looked at me and I asked to be reimbursed and he said he'd already reset the machine...information which would have been helpful several minutes ago!  Why do I go back there!!!"}
{"text":"This place is alright. The employees are nice and they work fast. I got a bacon and cheddar bagel, and it was okay. I wasn't super impressed, but I wasn't really disappointed either. If okay bagels at okay prices are what you're looking for, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE. completely dead in restaurant. I usually go to an einsteins on Durango where service is friendly and fast. Here employees were rude and lazy. Almost every kind of bagel was gone and they were not making more. asked for coffee and someone started making it then continued to leave my cup unattended for 10 minutes. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"FOOD= Great
STAFF= Not too friendly
PRICE=$

Love running by here and grabbing a coffee & bagel with my daughter. Started going to the location on Sahara because the staff here isn't friendly. They are rude and don't really seem to have any people skills. 

Try their location on Sahara its nice with better seating and staff."}
{"text":"Advised the staff that there are no clean tables. They just ignored my request. I don't see any supervision. Someone just stormed out because of lack of caring. 
Hope they have a lot of working capital to keep this place open!"}
{"text":"Come here for breakfast sometimes before work since it's close to work. Im always greeted with a smile and they are quite fast in getting my order out. By far the best Einstein I've gone to around the area."}
{"text":"Standard chain bagel shop. They make several variations of good coffee. They have breakfast bagel options (some with eggs, steak, smoked salmon or veggies) which are not the greatest. If you order a dozen bucket of bagels to go (with two cream cheeses), you can get them pre-sliced, which is nice."}
{"text":"I have been to Einstein locations all over Vegas and I gotta say this one is the best. I am greeted happily every time I come inside, even at five o'clock in the morning. The food is made perfect every time. But above all the customer experience is what keeps me coming back. A couple of employees stand out above the rest, Rhonda and Jordan. Those two really go above and beyond all my expectations! Great job! Keep up the good work, you guys rock!"}
{"text":"I have always been a regular \"bagel eater\" at Einstein's but after my last experience, I don't think I will ever go back to this particular one again. From the moment I walked in employees were yelling over counters at each other and one was waving bagels in the air!
 When I went to order it went pretty smoothly, but when I got my bagel it was completely messed up. And the two other people there orders were wrong too. They remade mine and I was in a hurry to get where I was going so I left, just to find out that they made mine incorrectly AGAIN!! I was tired of dealing with these people but even if they didn't get my order wrong two times the service alone was enough for me to not go back."}
{"text":"What a disaster.  I have contually given them a chance because they are so close to home but I would rather spend more money somewhere else than continue waste my time here.  Staff are children, cannot seem to get an order correct, cheese when said NO cheese, scrambled eggs when I specifically said \"I hate scrambled eggs, soggy bagels, wrong orders, wrong orders...did I mention they can't get an order correct!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times for work lunch.  Usually the staff is fast and very nice.  The turkey/bacon/avocado on whole wheat is absolutely delicious as a lunch combo with potato salad and a pickle.  The Club Mex is pretty good.  The blueberry smoothie is edible, but it's no Jamba Juice. The chicken salad is also delicious, although one time they didn't cover my whole sandwich with it -- they left a quarter of my sandwich blank.  So I took a star off for that, and on rare occasions my sandwich took forever to make for no apparent reason.  As another plus, however, Einstein's \"club\" coupons are unusually good (i.e. 2 for one).  I just received one via email."}
{"text":"Just ordered sesame bagel and coffee and took more than 20 minutes and when gave it to me, cold and it means been sitting there for a while! Crews did a lot of bitching than taking care of fast orders... Sad"}
{"text":"Einsteins is super close to our home and we usually go here on Saturday or Sunday morning about 1x a week.  The staff has always been friendly and my wife and I can usually find a table on the weekends to sit down. I generally get the everything bagel with chive cream cheese with adding a tomato and cucumbers..p.s. You can add a couple of veggies at no cost on your bagel.

My wife generally gets the lox bagel..quite expensive for a piece of lox but it makes her happy!

Overall I do like the bagels here and have tried many bagel places throughout my years. Sometimes you will get alot of cream cheese on a bagel and others you will get a small taste..if I am paying a few bucks for a bagel/cream cheese I would like a lot on. Overall we like coming here on the weekends!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times. In the last several years the service at this Einsteins continues to decline. I cannot begin to tell you how rude some employees are. Rudeness today was not the issue. I ordered a toasted onion bagel, lox, extra onion and extra capers. They take my order. They then call my name and inform we they do not have any onion bagels. I switch the order to a toasted plain bagel. Then they call my name again and inform me they have no onion. WTF!!!!! I left and I won't be back.  The place is a complete disaster. At one time, before I retired in 2008, they were the place to be. The food and service was good. I do not know what went wrong but it clearly has continued to be an all day train wreck. The town of Gilbert would be greatly improved if this business closed.  Going there is like being in an all day train wreck. I went to the store at Gilbert Road and Baseline and got the order right the first time."}
{"text":"Saturday morning rush. I'm sure it happens every Saturday as hordes of conventioneers grab breakfast before heading to the airport. I understand a rush. I am also a generally patient person. (I am fine with waiting an hour or more for a table at good restaurants.) But...

When there is a continuous line of people between the order station and the register, half of whom already have their food and just want to hand over some money, you call for a second cashier. When you *are* the second cashier, instead of walking out of the back, looking around like Punxsutawney Phil on February 2, and then crawling back into a hole, you actually spend 10 minutes clearing the line. Maybe dedicate someone to making all the coffee concoctions people order so you don't have the one staffed register empty for 4 minutes at a time.

It took me about 15 minutes to get to the register, by which time my bagel was getting cold. I stood waiting for about 4 minutes as employees dawdled at the prep station, ignored the call for a second cashier, plodded through coffee orders, etc. The last straw was when a woman from the back of the line came up and asked for two coffee cups and an approximation of the cost so she could just leave cash... and the woman behind the counter (who was working on a fancy coffee order at the time) actually switched to the other register to ring her up! I was done. I picked up the register pen, wrote \"Nevermind\" on the order slip, set my overpriced bagel and expensive orange juice on the counter, and walked out. (Yeah, Einstein Bros, that was me.) If you don't want my money, you aren't getting it.

Instead, I am at Starbucks a couple blocks away. My order? A bagel, orange juice, and a banana. And all cost considerably less than what it would have at Einstein Bros."}
{"text":"I drive by on my way to work and most of the time I can get in and out rather quickly. As of late, it takes 10, almost 15 minutes after I order to get one bagel and shmear. Today, with only 3 people ahead of me, it took 10 minutes. The person ahead of me hand picked her box of bagels and it took 3 teenage employees to slice them with knives, all the while my one bagel sat waiting. I'm all about efficiency, so iI was annoyed that they hand sliced them, so what is the industrial slicer sitting there for? I've seen them use it, so why not use it for a bakers dozen? Another time there were hardly any bagels on a Friday morning. I asked why they were low on bagels and the girl said the morning cook didn't come in. Come on! Where are the adult employees at this place? I will stop at einsteins on greenway/64th street instead."}
{"text":"I walked in on a Saturday, mid morning so of course the place was packed and the line was long. I was rightfully appreciative to find a well integrated staff. The girl at the counter knew the details of the menu and was able To multi task well. She truly was a huge reason the line moved quickly, orders got put in and moved along. The staff making the sandwiches and running the registered were also handling multiple things at a time but were fabulously efficient. The only staff member who wasn't in synch was the young girl making the drinks. High school girl looked like it was way too early to be up, phone in her back pocket and was still learning the menu. I saw her have to remake a few things. However, she was pleasant to customers. I have one slight dissapointment- I bought a dozen box and it was suppose to come with 13 bagels but when I got home the girl at the counter miscounted because there were only 12. Not the end of the world, but I should get what I paid for."}
{"text":"Lovely store and atmosphere, however 
1.  We could overhear the manager semi-yelling at people in the back to hurry up
2.  The eggs on the breakfast bagels looked cheap and microwaved
3. They forgot to put tomato on one of our breakfast sandwiches, and when we mentioned it, they took the bagel with unclean hands and sloppily opened it up, put on tomato, and and handed it back to us... It was really gross.  

On the positive side, the coffee was good!  But overall, it was a rough experience.  We regretted not going to Panera..."}
{"text":"I love this place! Very clean, Great staff, Good food! This place has a great variety of bagels, made fresh daily. It hard to choose between the 6-cheese or jalapeño cheddar but I suffer through the decision process 3-4 times a week.  I'm a plain shmear person but the honey-almond is pretty good if you want something sweet."}
{"text":"Bagel was passable but nothing to rave about. 

Service was quick. 

The place was filthy.  Drink station was a mess. The corners were full of grime.  Where it was critical to be clean it was but still it bugged me."}
{"text":"ALWAYS GETS MY ORDER WRONG!!

I'm fed up and done with this one the seriously need to change it because I can't possibly be the only one!"}
{"text":"1:30 in the afternoon and they're out of every single  bagel except two nasty \"gingerbread\" bagels. Then the one slow rude woman working there takes forever to wait on everyone as if she holds all in contempt. Never going there again."}
{"text":"This place is horribly run. Tried it twice, won't be going back. Last time it took 40 minutes to get two sandwiches."}
{"text":"Einstein's and I have a usual love affair. This being said, I was extremely dissapointed in this location. 

The entrance is awkward and they are usually understaffed. I love their bagels and their fresh squeezed OJ......\"Fresh Squeezed OJ\"---- is usually from concentrate at this store. Being an Einstein fanatic, I can tell. At first sip. That this was a frozen juice concentrate. Other Einstein's have a tangy, sweet OJ. 

And the shmear:

 Eisntein's is usually known for globbing ooey gooey, delicious and ridiculous amounts of shmear on their bagels. This Einstein's seems to scrape the bottom of the barrrel to get enough to cover your bagel. 

So sad as this is really close to my work but it looks like I'll have to continue to go to Shea or Desert Ridge for my Blueberry Bagel, toasted, with Strawberry Cream Cheese."}
{"text":"Excellent business. Employees are always friendly. Food is very good. Almost five stars. Just a little crazy with the way you order at one register, pay at another. Always seems to work ok, though. Specialty bagels are great but I won't say which because sometimes they run out before I get there!:)

The Scottsdale Rd. & Thomas location gets my recommendation, too. The other day I ordered easy on the cream cheese. The young lady who made the order got it wrong but apologized as she handed me the bagel. No problem. I was very impressed that she would admit and ask if she could remake it. Managers - you are doing something right! Keep up the honesty and positive  attitudes!"}
{"text":"I walk in and no one says anything to me. I wait 5min until someone takes my order and other customers come in. They I am noticed since the line has grew. I place my order she says I'll take your payment down there. No good morning how is your day? When I receive my food, which I order the same at every location which is a ham and Swiss bagel I get it as a sandwich and not in the box that it usually comes it. And this is what I get. Two slices of ham and one slice of cheese. So depressing. I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"1 star is the best I can muster for this disaster of a location. I've tried to give this place a chance since it's close to my home but both times I left extremely disappointed. Most importantly, it's the service. It is dreadful! All very young staff with clearly no accountability or proper training. So I don't entirely blame them as much as I do management/owner. Most of the time the staff are having inappropriate conversations very loudly and demonstrating zero desire to be working. At one of my visits I witnessed what appeared to be a manager throwing a verbal fit to one of the employees...which by the way he was the best and hardest working individual there that day. With all that said the food isn't any better. They are usually out of a certain product. One time I ordered a wrap and he thought they were out of them only to tell me they did have some but it was out of code if I wanted it! Smh. And I also don't recommend looking behind the counter at the food prep stations - Yikes!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious. May be hard to spot. Its in front of burger king. Very good quality and can alter to your needs ."}
{"text":"This location seems quite accustomed to lots of people going through their location at once. I came during comiccon and their service was great! My order came out exactly like I ordered, the wait time was very short, the staff were friendly and knew what they were doing.

Great location, good food. Almost five stars but I'm picky and there was too much shear on my bagel :D"}
{"text":"Just got my fresh bagels. Mmmm they smell bagelicious! Bought the Monday special,  staff always have big  smile and friendly conversation. Will keep some in the freezer,  individually wrap and have it for breakfast any morning I desire."}
{"text":"I came to Einstein Bros once and have never gone anywhere else since. Great bagels and assortment of drinks. Have not had a better bagel anywhere other than NYC. Customer service is always good and plenty of seating both indoor and outside."}
{"text":"Really Einstein's? My husband went to pick up food today from this location. All three bagels were burnt. Black. With cream cheese strategically placed on top to try and cover it up. On top of that, my bagel sandwich was supposed to have no cheese because I'm on a dairy free restriction diet. Cheese, all over it."}
{"text":"This location gets 1 extra star because the staff were pleasant enough. It gets low marks for two reasons. First, it doesn't accept einstein gift cards. Look, I understand you're a franchise location but you're still an Einstein's. As a customer I shouldn't have to figure out which Einstein's to go to if I have gift cards. If you hold yourself out as an Einstein's to get the benefits of that brand, you should take the burdens too, including taking gift cards. This is something headquarters and franchises need to work out rather than putting the onus on customers.  Corporate rant over.

Second, they forgot to toast my bagel. Still a decent bagel but I was really craving the toastiness. All I ordered was a bagel and a coffee. I'd be more forgiving if it was busy but I was the only person there. The employees outnumbered me 3 to 1. I had a small, simple order. Not as much leeway for mistakes in my book."}
{"text":"Service is horrible ordered 1 Asiago bagel toasted with cream cheese on the side took 15 min to get when the people in front of me have already received there orders and their sandwhiches which takes longer to make , I ask the girl who took my order (blonde girl who looks like she hates her job ) how long it takes she looks at me and tells me it's just finishing , then one of the other employees gladly hands her her bagel and coffee I'm sorry I'm not understanding how this works ,she gets her order done first before a customer? And to top it off my bagel was barely toasted!!!! While you have 4-5 employees standing around chit chatting. Stay away if you can there is no sense of urgency to take care of the customers"}
{"text":"A paucity of cream cheese.  
I haven't been here in years. This morning I was craving cream cheese on something. I remembered that Einstein's used to give loads of cream cheese on their bagels. Nope. Not now.  More expensive (of course) and a teeny tiny bit of cream cheese.  Such a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Seriously, only Einsteins could manage to F'up a bagel and cream cheese. EVERY, SINGLE, TIME, I go here they get my order wrong. Forget to toast the bagel. Give me the wrong kind of bagel. Refuse to cut my bagel in half. They never have any of the bagels that people want (Everything, garlic). But you can bet that they have a bajillion Green Chile bagels laying around. Fruit cups look dangerously old. Ridiculous ordering system. Honestly I wish I could like this place better because I live so close but Jeez. Never in my life have I seen such a simple concept so poorely executed. The absolute worst bagel store I have ever stepped foot in."}
{"text":"Came in and we ordered two jalapeño cheddar bagels and while waiting we were told that the girl taking the orders \"accidentally\" sold one of our bagels to the person after us. How do you sell what you already sold? Didn't make a big deal out of it. Chose a different one. While waiting again we get called over and told that the jalapeño bagel was burnt. I can't even understand what happened. Or why."}
{"text":"Got bagels here to take to the team at work.  The staff was patient with me as I picked out the exact mix I wanted to take in, and they had a few recommendations.  The bagels were your basic bagels that I've come to expect from Einstein or Panera-type places.  Good but nothing to write home (or give a great Yelp review!) about."}
{"text":"I was just here this morning. I got a dozen with 2 smears. The place was packed and there was a line of about 5 people but it moved fast and I was waited on quickly and efficiently."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, my order gets messed up. They mix up orders, forget to provide you with a drink, etc. Always get a receipt so you can prove that you ordered what you did when they forget to give it to you."}
{"text":"I come here all the time! Excellent service, always a smile and they remember my name and my order"}
{"text":"Bagels are fine. A bit more doughy than they should be but ok overall. If I'm craving a legit NY bagel, would I come here? No. If I needed a bread product, would I come here? Possibly."}
{"text":"It's a one star rating by default, deserving of no stars.

7am Getting to work and kids to school, stopped off to grab a coffee and a bite. We were the only ones there and three employees behind the counter. Ordered our food and drinks to go. I decided to purchase a stainless steel refillable mug, advertised on the display rack for $7.99. The cashier, bless her heart, in addition to running the cash register was tasked with making a smoothie that we ordered. Off the bat, this was not a task she could handle. She pulled out the smoothie mix and then she glazed over. She decided to check us out and just ignore the smoothie. Back at the  cash register, the mug rings up $11.99. I bring up that it's advertised as $7.99. After all three employees walk over and confirm the price and the display, the head staff mucks with the register and I can see that she does NOT know how to make an adjustment to the tab. The best she comes up with is to take off the price of a bagel and smear,$2.40. She tells me that this is all she can take off. I point out that it is clearly advertised for $7.99. She then gives me some BS, that it was a promotional price that was not removed. I said no thanks to the mug , she was shocked that I did not want to pay more than advertised. 

Back to the smoothie... That was put on pause for 17 minutes. The head staff had to step in for the cashier and poured the smoothie concentrate and ice into the blender. 

The last straw that will forever make me avoid this franchise . I get the bag that held my bagel ... The bagel was smashed completely flat and cream cheese smeared about the bag. 

7:20 finally out the door! We were the only customers in at the time of ordering! Why is it such a struggle to get a friggin' bagel and coffee?????"}
{"text":"Of all the Einstein locations (and I have been to all between N Phoenix and N Scottsdale), this is the best, customer oriented Einstein. Place is always clean and the staff is always friendly and efficient.  I would highly recommend this Einstein, it outshines all others!"}
{"text":"I understand that it's a holiday making it busier then a normal Monday, but my experience was worse then I could have imagined it to be. I live right down the street and am here often and never had a problem but today made me never want to return again. I could see other customers in as much shock as I was. If I would have worked in that environment I would have walked out. The way dorthy was talking to her fellow employees was disgusting. The way she yelled orders out and how impatient she was with her staff and customers was unacceptable."}
{"text":"5 am and I was looking for a Einstein spot foooound it 
And it was quick and just as good as any location 
Do any of the locations have drive thru's ? 
But yeah back on topic was bomb per usual"}
{"text":"Most apathetic, borderline rude staff. 

My Tasty Turkey sandwich was protein slim, but otherwise good. 

I would not come back just because the service is atrocious. Management needs to get involved to weed out staff that is rude or not providing friendly service."}
{"text":"Came - it was closed with an unfriendly note on the door \"reasons beyond our control\" - yet no one was there fixing anything.  Yikes.  Go to Big City Bagels 2 minutes away for hot & fresh breakfast in a clean & friendly atmosphere"}
{"text":"I come here everyday. Besides the fact that einsteins is definetely overpriced. It has slowly gotten worse and worse. From over burnt bad bagels. To this. 

I got an egg n cheddar
They added bacon and it was probably the sloppiest sandwhich ever made

I cant eat bacon so i gave it back and they remade me this bagel The top bagel was litterally 1cm thick. 

Maybe they should redo this whole einsteins."}
{"text":"The owner of this franchise should be ashamed. A bunch of bumbling space cadets working there. No leadership. Never going back in there. Ever."}
{"text":"Most of the staff is great but I've had one not so pleasant experience with the Manager and have seen him be less than pleasant with other customers on occasion.  

Unfortunately my recent experience with the manager has led me to other Einstein locations but day to day this location will work for most people.

They are usually fast and have what they should."}
{"text":"Nice place with decent prices (unlike Vegas..)
We took the omelet mushroom bagel and was really good one 
Enjoy"}
{"text":"Delicious bagels, delicious coffee, excellent customer service. What more can you ask for? A nice break from the common \"fast-food breakfast\"."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat.
I've been coming there for about 10 yrs and can only say it gets better and better.
The staff in this particular 
Einsteins is the best. Very Friendly 
Bagels and coffee always good."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about writing this review because I tried to find the good in where I go, understand that dealing with the public is hard. With that said, still no excuse for the rudeness from the staff. I ordered. She didn't ask my name. No big deal. The lady behind me ordered, the girl was persistent on getting her name. She was a older lady, security guard. The girl was so rude to her. I was at the coke machine, the lady paying. And the girl was telling another Co-worker about how the lady didn't want to use her name, just put it down as security. What's so hard about that and move on. That's what I'm thinking. Anyways the girl called her a F... hag. I couldn't believe it. I was at the coke machine and heard this. Than she yelled at the lady from over the counter and called her rude. I still couldn't believe the other 2 workers didn't apologize or tell the girl to go chill out. Just sad. I'll never eat there again. I can get bagels somewhere else. And this happen a month ago. Still talk about it because it bothers me to think that the girl thinks she probably did nothing wrong. I just can't believe she doesn't get complaints. You don't just out of know where call people F.... hags, and yell across the counter. (Over a name). Come on."}
{"text":"I love Einstein Bagels but this location is completely unorganized.  Empty bagel bins and cream cheese fridge, coffees empty, milk/creamer empty. I called in catering order for next morning pick up. They did not pay any attention to the types of bagels I requested... unfortunately, I didn't find out until after I left... While waiting for my order to be completed, I ordered bagel and coffee for myself.  Had to ask for coffee cup three times, they forgot my bagel order so I had to remind them.  The cashier was friendly but person who seemed like the manager was a joke. He didn't have time to fill bins, coffee, etc but he had time to go outside and chat with buddies.They made sure to take care of friends who skipped the line and went around the counter to get freebies.  Definitely my last time at this location.  BTW... they were not very busy. maybe 0-3 people in line the whole time I was there."}
{"text":"Good bagels a little expensive for a toasted bagel and cream cheese. We also ordered the turkey sandwiches for lunch later on and they were decent but not worth $7 a piece."}
{"text":"The food quality has fallen a great deal over the last year or 2. The amount of meat on the sandwiches has decreased and it's been a very long time since I've gotten ripe avocado no matter the season. It's always unripe and hard, not worth the dollar extra. They also removed the sprouts from the menu but that's not the locations fault. Just a bummer since I love me some sprouts! They've got great bagels and coffee but their \"cooked\" items are not that great. Guess that's why it's not called Breakfast Brothers."}
{"text":"I have been coming here a lot with my girlfriend and I have decided to give this place a review. This particular location I am very pleased with. Although more often than none, there are never any open tables but they do have some tables outside. If its not too cold outside, my girlfriend and I have say outside. I do have to point out that they do keep their location clean and neat. I always am greeted immediately upon entering, they are always friendly, and everyone here is always smiling. Not a bad place to go to for a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"Had the WORST experience as a customer at this location. I was on my way to take my son to daycare when I decided to get him a quick bagel with cream cheese for breakfast. I walked in and did as you usually do at Einsteins, you order at one area and then you'll pay at another. I'm waiting there for not even 10 seconds, patiently and pleasantly, as I do see the blonde female cashier ringing up someone. I'm looking over the menu and all of a sudden, that same cashier YELLS from her register across the damn room in the rudest tone \"YOU ORDER OVER HERE, YOU PAY OVER HERE.\" Like holy hell, who pissed in your coffee this morning?! If my son wasn't with me, I would have walked out right then and there, but he was hungry so I stayed. I walk over completely thrown off and embarrassed that I just got yelled at by an employee to come to her in front of my son and the other customers that were eating. She takes my order with a huge attitude and acts/talks to me as if I am completely inconveniencing her for ordering food. By now, I am fuming that I spent my money here and am getting treated like crap for absolutely no reason. Yet, the next mother with kids that walked in to order were treated nicely and properly taken care of at the order station and the separate pay area by the little brunette employee that had stood next to the horrible blonde cashier that was awful to me. I took my bagel and left and will not return to this location. DO NOT COME HERE. 
PS. Hey honey, YOU picked this bullsh*t job, not me. So maybe don't come to your job with an attitude and looking like a bird made a nest in your hair and you had drugs for breakfast."}
{"text":"The service was sub par. The restaurant was  empty and it took them 10 minutes to ring me up for my bagels. 
 
  When picking my bagels they only had three options of bagels. What Bagel shop is out of 75% of their bagels. Poorly operated"}
{"text":"I always been a fan of Einstein Bagels and this location is the best, period!! I go to this location 3 to 5 times a week before work and they always know my order.

Great breakfast, great friendly staff service. Always a pleasure  to meet locals there!"}
{"text":"This place is a total train wreck. The kids are working hard and fast but not smart and efficiently. They screwed up my order and the guy in front of me. They did fix it but at the efficiency of a slow moving car crash. Sorry I'll up my review on another visit"}
{"text":"I love this place! Every time I go there is a line but they staff appropriately so the line moves really quickly.  The employees are always so nice and I have never been disappointed in anything I have ordered. I am so happy to be just a stones though away- and I absolutely love the pumpkin bagels, smear, and lattes!"}
{"text":"Very unhappy with the service at this location!
Employees too a long time too acknowledge that I was there!
Bagel ok
Service not good!
Never had a bad experience at other locations !"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place! I really, really do! However, the service is soooo slow, the staff unconcerned, and the manager hostile. Seriously, how hard is it to put the correct bagel & shmear in a bag?!? This place has had enough chances to earn my business - I'm done!"}
{"text":"Bathroom cleaning log for Einstein Bagles on Eastern and Warm Springs showed the last day it was cleaned was the 11th...Today is the 18th ... so am I to assume the bathrooms haven't been cleaned for a week?! Hope the kitchen gets cleaned more often. Also would be nice if your employees smile every once in a while."}
{"text":"Love the Bagels, hate the service. Probably the slowest and worst service on the planet.   25 minuets to get 1 toasted bagel with nothing on it. Happens everyone.  It's just not worth it."}
{"text":"The times I have visited, the service is not really firendly, it feels rushed... you better know what you want if you stand in front the cashier.  The baggels aren't great, just OK.  I wish there was a pop and mom place near by like the one I used to go to in Gilbert."}
{"text":"I love the Arrowhead and Glendale locations so I stopped in since I was in the area. This location is not nearly as nice as the other two. It's cramped, not as clean and the coffee was cold. The food was still good but they were also doing construction on the roof so instead of relaxing and enjoying my coffee and meal, I was listening to constant banging on the roof the whole time I was there. If you're used to the warm inviting environment of other locations you won't find that here."}
{"text":"I love Einstein bagels but never will go to this location again! I have been there 3 times and every time they are out of PLAIN bagels, which is the only kind my daughter likes. I went yesterday, Saturday at 9 am and out again! I asked the red haired young boy working the counter, why they are always out of plain bagels, he said\"I dont know, I'm not the baker!\" Meanwhile 5 people are standing around doing nothing, not sure which one was the BAKER but go make some more!!"}
{"text":"Rudest cashier ever, her name is Mary. I enquired which bagels were last made, her response was a very surly \"don't know\" followed by rolling eyes. No manners at all, with so many choices for coffee and sandwiches there is zero reason to return here."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely filthy.  The staff were making sandwiches wearing gloves BUT they kept touching their clothes, their hair and the garbage in the same gloves then touching the food.  I asked the clerk to have them change their gloves.  When I looked at the counter they were working on, it was covered in old food debris.  The workers were throwing food and garbage on the floor rather than in the garbage bins.  I asked for the manager.   The clerk told me that the manager was at a meeting.  I asked the clerk if her would let his children eat here.  Her hesitated for about 20 seconds and then said yes, but I don't believe him.  One more thing, the egg cooker in the counter was caked with food debris.  The public health department should close this place down."}
{"text":"The food was great, so was the coffee. But the service.. Eh. Every time I walk in there I kind of feel unwanted. As if the workers would appreciate if there were no customers. That's not good for business! We pay you, ladies."}
{"text":"This place is great and really close to my workplace. Friendly people work here, makes it worth the walk."}
{"text":"I come here often. The service is pretty quick even if there are a few people in line. The staff is really friendly and will get me half & half for my coffee, if it's not already out. The one issue I have is they still have not replaced the vanilla shaker that went missing a few years ago."}

What the fuck? 

Why is it every time I go in to get a bagel from any of your chain, but in particular this place, I a) cannot get what I want because you're out of plain bagels, b) when I can get a bagel its always smashed to hell and torn up from the floor up, and c) you take goddamn near forever to hand me a third rate product while having the unmitigatedly huge ball sack to act as if you're doing me a favor?

Not joking around Einstein's, every time I go into this place, you guys somehow find new and inventive ways to fuck up in the same exact ways. This is really getting old. 

You need to regulate your product output. Running out of every bagel by 0900 on a Sunday is just not going to cut it there stranger danger! 

You need to teach your staff not to act as if serving bagels is tantamount to preforming brain surgery. You're not curing cancer, bagels are not the solution to the budget cliff, you're not going to ensure peace in the middle east because you put out a fourth rate baked good.

In short, get your shit together. I won't be going back, which sucks as you've run every small mom and pop bagel shop and deli out of business in my morning drive area. You're like the cracked out Walmart of Bagels. I half expect every time I come in to see Honey Boo Boo behind the register with a Manager badge on, because only someone like her could be as amazingly incompetent as your store seems to be."}
{"text":"Was there on Saturday, December 10th with my special lady friend. Needed some breakfast, and bagels sounded pretty darn good.

Went into Einstein Bros, and this is where it all went wonky. 

They were out of everything by noon. They were baking more in the back, no big deal, I can wait four minutes.

Get them out of the bag once they're ready to go, and they were torn to Hell. Not even intact enough that I really wanted to eat them. Went in to complain to the manager, who just blew me off. \"Well, they can't all be perfect.\"

I'm done with this place. Bagels are easy. Shouldn't have gone like this."}
{"text":"This location is awesome!, Customer service was perfect from the moment I walked into the door! Cameron at the register was very helpful,very professional and smiled the entire time. My salmon Nova Lox was delicous! The music selection creates a peaceful,inviting atmotsphere. A great place to spend your sunday morning!

Maltiox:"}
{"text":"I love this place, everyone is friendly and really helpful. I come in about once or twice a week and they remember my name and go out of their way to ask how I am. Coffee is great, bagels are awesome. When they have a coupon available it makes the price even better. Weekends are busy but the line moves very fast and efficient, I've never not found a place to sit. Had some great coffee meetings at this location and I'm glad they are around and can offer an alternative to being at Starbucks."}
{"text":"Delicious, pretty cheap and fast.  Love the potato salad.  Love the turkey, bacon, avocado sandwich."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. Huge line and customers keep leaving the shop before even they get to register to order their meals. Unexperience employee that is so slow, and not even understand customers orders to put in the computer. Manager on duty simply staying at the register and do nothing. When I brought the problem to his attention,  he said: \"He will get better.\" This is my last visit to this location. Dirty floor.  Wish I could talk to the main office. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"Bagels are fantastic!  Service varies, usually just okay.  Bathrooms are so bad they are creepy - just avoid even looking in there, it is like a horror flick.
Nice place to go on a Saturday if you don't mind a limited selection or an afternoon when there are less patrons.  Just leave before you have to \"go\"."}
{"text":"Service is very slow had to wait for the 5 girls working up front to stop flirting with other customers and take my order! It's definitely a college spot for little kids!!"}
{"text":"We live nearby, so I tried to make it work. 
Not So Much.
The bagel type we wanted (chocolate chip) - they were out.
The sandwich (chicken) that we wanted - they didn't have.
They forgot to give me the freezer bags I requested.
They did not honor my coupon for free doggy bagel.
They could not honor my gift card because \"the server is down\".
No thanks, never again....."}
{"text":"The Einstein in Henderson was a standard morning routine when we lived here. When we visit, now on the northwest side of town, Einstein remains a treat. Place puts Starbucks, etc. to SHAME.

Schmeers are all very good. Salmon is briny and salty, and delicious. Coffee just right, lemonade and other drinks not too sweet, bagels perfect. Staff is efficient and friendly. 

Can't go wrong with Einstein. Thankfully expanding up to Reno this Fall."}
{"text":"well, a little over a year ago i started going to EBB for lox and bagels, and some rich dark coffee.

it's been a good run for the most part, the staff know my name, know my order, and get me out the door in 5 minutes or less.  Yet over the past 60 days or so... the amount of lox on my lox and bagel, everything bagel, double toasted has been less and less... it's somewhat startling when you think how much money EBB will save by taking an ounce of lox here and there off of your sandwich multiplied by the number purchased worldwide in 24 hours.  i'm all for conservation but in this case, NIMBY.

soooo, i brought it to the attention of the manager today... the ginger one.  and his first response was \"Really?\"

and i thought to myself... no, i'm making this up so you and i can have a conversation, by the way, how's the wife and kids?  Yes, REALLY, otherwise i wouldn't speak up... NITWIT!!!

while i'm thinking to myself, the manager says \"let me show you something\" and quickly exits to the kitchen.

at almost the same time the server hands me my bagel. i choose to exit quickly having expressed my concern over the ever diminishing quantity of lox and quality of the lox and bagels being sold.

by this time, i've already decided that this is my last visit for awhile, so as i walk out the door, instead of my customary \"see you later\" i said \"GOODBYE\"

soooo, i get to work, open my lox and bagels... and sonofab*tch... they didn't toast my bagel!!!

i'm done with EBB at this location.

you can kiss this multiple purchases per week customer goodbye."}
{"text":"Einsteins is my favorite place to get a simple cup of coffee. Esp if it's a refill cup, very affordable. I enjoy the bagels as well, but their customer service at this location, isn't the greatest. But if you don't care about the service, it's pretty mellow there. Hardly ever lines to wait in."}
{"text":"Being a good husband, I volunteered to take my wife to another day at Sister's Closet. It takes her hours to go through everything - and I'm usually left to find something to do to kill time.  Fortunately, they now have an Einstein's in the same shopping area.  A lifesaver!! I was able to have several cups of coffee, some wonderful onion bagels with cream cheese, and to casually read the newspaper without being hurried and feeling I was taking up space.

It is large, clean, and the workers a cheerful and helpful.  The only glitch was that on one of my bagel orders, they lost the order!! Not a big deal - I wasn't going anywhere  - so once they figured out the order got lost in cyberspace - they immediately re-entered it and brought it to my table.

So now I'm covered - if my wife has to be at Sisters early in the morning, I can relax at Einsteins!!"}
{"text":"Love the breakfast sandwiches, they are large, filling and delicious.  The chicken salad sandwich is also great and my dogs love the doggie bagel treats.

The staff is friendly and the new set up gets you in and out much more quickly.

The only reason that I can't give them that 5th star is that they took away the call ahead ordering which used to be my Sunday routine.  When you are in a hurry the ability to call ahead and run in and get your breakfast was a lifesaver! But since they won't take phone orders anymore I have found myself going to other places that will."}
{"text":"Another terrible experience at Einstein's. The place was packed and they were backed up. They had our choice of bagels when we ordered but of course they didn't when it came time to prepare them. 

Why did this happen? Keenly observing I noticed that anyone who ordered a cold bagel or dozen was served immediately. You'd think they'd be able to manage quantities better than that.

Very disappointed again, time to move on. I wish there was another bagel shop in the area."}
{"text":"Worst bagel place. Ever. For the past 4 weeks they've been out of plain bagels. Shame on me for coming back but I do it for my kids who keep getting disappointed. The staff is slow and incompetent. The place is dirty. And the selection is pitiful. Spend an extra 5 minutes and go down the street to another bagel place."}
{"text":"Staff don't care... 
Cashier rung me up with attitude and urgency (no one was behind me).  I ordered a sandwich (she didn't inform me that the bread the sandwich comes on was out of stock) when she took my card to pay for my order, she accidentally threw my card and said sorry like she didn't care she did it (didn't bother to pick it up). 
Not coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Everything you would hope for or want in a bagel shop.  Bagels in flavors various, a bunch of shmear options, bagel sandwiches, coffee drinks, and so on.  I was hungry after driving to South Mountain and walking around all morning, so I ordered a sesame bagel with vegetable shmear, a pretzel bagel with garlic herb shmear, and an iced coffee.  Both bagels were fresh and sufficiently schmeared.  The pretzel bagel was pretty salty, which I liked, but beware if you're sensitive to salt.  They had a buttery caramel coffee option (which I understand is limited time only) so I went for that.  It was delightful."}
{"text":"This shop had exemplary customer service; friendly, polite and efficient. The value-for-money was unbeatable. The coffee served is a \"bottomless cup\". My bagel and beverages were tasty. Overall excellent!"}
{"text":"This is the closest Einstein's to my apartment, and I love bagels, so I've come here pretty regularly for the past couple of years.  The staff is generally pretty nice and friendly, though I've had a couple of bad experiences.  They run out of the popular types of bagels by early afternoon, even earlier on the weekends, so I often have to go with a second or third choice.  However, the reason that I'm giving them 2 stars is that I have come to expect them to get my order wrong more often than not.  I always take out, so in the early days of coming here before I learned to check my bag, I ended up at home with bagels with the wrong cream cheese, wrong types of bagel, a toasted bagel with no topping when I had paid for butter, etc.  Just this morning, I was given a bagel with plain cream cheese when I had ordered honey almond.  At this point, though, I always check my bagels before I leave to get anything straightened out.  I gave them back the bagel and asked politely for one with honey almond cream cheese like I had ordered, and they made a new one - but did not apologize or give any indication that they cared that they had messed up, which is pretty typical.  I still come because I love Einstein's in general and this is by far the most convenient, but it is never a great experience."}
{"text":"So I stop into Einstein's like I do every other Monday to pick up a box of bagels and creamcheese for our sprint meetings, and I also got a Bacon and Cheddar on a sesame bagel with mayo, same as always.

My sandwich came with a fried egg on it instead of the usual scrambled patty they've been serving me for years. No warning, no explanation, just a nice surprise of filthy fried egg nastiness on my formerly dependable sandwich. BE WARNED - they do fried eggs on the sandwiches now.

Way to fuck up a good thing, Einstein's. I'll still get the meeting bagels from you, but I'll be getting my breakfast elsewhere from now on. Yuck."}
{"text":"First time in maybe the last time and they were too busy having a conversation to pay attention their customers and not be so rude"}
{"text":"Everyone but the manager was great. I found a hair in my food and took it back and the manager was standing there and didn't even turn around to say sorry or anything he was just ordering the other employees to take care of it. I think that is very rude, he didn't even acknowledge that I was there. I didn't appreciate that horrible customer service. I'm not eating there again!"}
{"text":"I just arrived at Einstein Bagels and did not even get to ordering as I had been waiting in line and an associate approached the person behind me to take their order, and I kindly said \"excuse me we were waiting next.\" The employee who I've now learned is named Fiona,  said \"okay what do you want' I said we would like an egg sandwich with just egg no cheese,  she very curtly and with zero expression says\" what kind of bagel \" seemingly agitated.  I said you know what,  never mind.  And my kids and I walked out.  As I was getting into my car a fellow customer stopped me and said 'I just wanted to say I was watching and I'm so sorry you experienced such bad customer service that girl seemed so irritated to help you\"  I said how very sweet of her to come out and mention it and she said I should complain (she is the manager of a nearby restaurant it turns out.) I went back in to mention it and make sure I got the associates name who had acted so irritated to take my order, and the woman at the register who was very friendly went to see if a manager was there.  She also walked over to Fiona and mentioned I had asked to speak to a manager about her,  Fiona rolled her eyes and turned around saying something.  I told the woman at the register that in the future Fiona might want to take customer's opinions of her more seriously as not only had I decided to leave without further ordering but another customer was also affected negatively.   Not a a good move,  we will not come back and doubt the other customer will either.  Only giving 1 star due to the kindness of the girl at the register."}
{"text":"The restaurant closes at 4:00pm so I went in at 3:35 to get a hummus veg out. Apparently they close up before they close because all they had were bagels and cream cheese. No veggies, meat or cheese available because they already put it away. This was upsetting because if you're not closed then you're open for business unless advertised otherwise."}
{"text":"Have been coming to this location since it opened many years ago.  Service and quality of food have always great.  BUT, things have recently gone downhill.  On the past 6 or 7 visits nearly every order has had errors, either duplicate items added to the order or incorrect items delivered.  Twice, we've ended up with a duplicate sandwich.  Neither time did either the order taker or cashier mention that we had two of the same sandwiches.  And the multiple sandwiches with incorrect items are simply a sign of the \"whatever\" philosophy this Einsteins has seemingly recently adopted.  This used to be the primo Einsteins in the Valley.  So good, in fact it was the one many new managers were trained at.  WHAT HAPPENED???"}
{"text":"My husband WAS going here for carry out breakfast 2-3 times each week, but they have now screwed up our order 4 times in a row and we are done!  I just threw away my breakfast.  He had ordered the Southwest Turkey Sausage sandwich for me and I instead received some disgusting thing with no sausage, piled with mushrooms and so much of some orange sauce that the entire wrapper was covered.  They just cannot our simple order for 2 right!  We are done and not going back."}
{"text":"We have been going here almost daily for years.  Love the coffee and bagels.
Nice community of regulars that we have gotten to know.
The Dutch Apple Bagel is the best!"}
{"text":"They were polite but I made a simple request for  fairly simple bagel sandwich I asked him not to cut the bagel and four pieces like they always do you know the top half the bottom half and then two other halved those two things and I asked for garlic cream cheese on it and I  received my sandwich cut up in pieces so I wasn't happy  perhaps they should do random drug test for marijuana use they did seem a little stoned"}
{"text":"6am Saturday.   Drive 15 min while salivating thinking about lox an cream cheese bagel
Pay
Wait 5 min before they start prep.  Toast bagel.  Apply. Cream cheese disappear into back.  Partially completed order sitting there after 5 more min of me glaring at the unfinished order..... Ask manager to ck status. Comes back and says..... Straight faced mind you...... We are waiting on the lox..... My response .... Someone one their way from Nova. Scotia ?  She said no \"it's frozen\" I say so actually you don't have any..... She replied correct....... This is how places lose customers forever.   If it were mom an pop shop no one would have taken your order. Your money. Your time only to say we are out........ Corporate America sux a s s ........ Hope ya go broke"}
{"text":"Staff disorganized. Thus bad service. Order was wrong and then egg was cold. Weird 'cause usually the egg is nuked to oblivion."}
{"text":"I loved Einstein Bros. when I lived in Boston.  While visiting my folks last December, I inquired as to where I may partake in a delicous, almost NY-like bagel, and my mom gave me the car keys and directions.  I believe this is a sister company to Noah's bagels, but somehow, these tasted better.  I got my mom a cheesy bagel with salmon, I think, and myself-the nutty-wheaty type (good grains?) with that honey cream cheese.  Also picked up two frozen mochas, and off I went.  Mom was pleased, as was I.  Place was packed, on a Saturday morning, but customer service was good, and the line moved fast."}
{"text":"Always hot fresh bagels, iced chai tea was the bomb! Friendly, fast , always feel welcome by the smiley staff."}
{"text":"The floors are so disguistingly dirty! The beverage cooler filter is so clogged with dust and grime like it's never been cleaned! I could see under the racks by the register and it was gross like never swept. I really had to question if it was that bad out front, what is it like in the back where they make the food?!  I cannot go back!"}
{"text":"After sitting around the office contemplating something different for lunch, we decided to make a run for bagel dogs. Sounded good, you know not the average sandwich. So it was off to Einstein's for a confirmed 6 dogs, with a couple of maybes, so a total of 8. Since they advertise these products on the internet you would think they would stock them. You know kind of like going to a car dealership for a car. 

Upon arrival I was greeted by a grumpy server who loved to talk to you with their back turned to you. And then she just snapped that they didn't have any, like in none.Then wanted to wait on the next person in line not allowing me to get in any other request i may have or if they could possibly look in back. They need to fire everyone there and start all over again. I know that I will certainly be taking my money and business elsewhere."}
{"text":"As a student on campus who is an avid fan of breakfast and coffee, this place is my go to. I love getting the turkey sausage and cheddar breakfast sandwich as its nice and hearty while being reasonably low in calories and fat. I enjoy this place even though the line can get busy at times it is still pretty quick do to the very speedy service of the team members. I would recommend this place for breakfast only as their lunch options are less than desirable and are very poor quality. The price is reasonable at best (especially if you invest in a coffee cup like me, or even a punch card), but $7 gets me a nice breakfast sandwich and a cup of medium coffee, not the worst price but defiantly could spend my money somewhere else. 

All in all; I would go here for breakfast, not anything else.

oh, they are also closed on weekends which suck"}
{"text":"Snuck away from work because I was craving a latte and the deliciousness of an Einstein speciality bagel this morning. I typically can get in and out of these places in about ten minutes tops, but they were slammed this morning. And that's okay! I worked as a breakfast waitress for 3 years, so I more than understand the busy morning struggle in the food service industry. BELIEVE ME people, no one working in a breakfast establishment cares about your petty problems. Ever. I gave them my order and waited about ten minutes before a handsome black guy came out and told me they were out of the bagel i wanted. totally fine. reached a compromise together. waited ten more minutes. I heard the barista call out my name and gave a bag to another lady in line with my same name, even though the lady was -at least- 6 people in line behind me. I continue to wait ten more minutes. As this point I have been waiting in Einstein's bagels for upwards of thirty minutes. When I addressed the issue to the counter, the girl in the hat admitted she must have made a mistake and then walked away. AGAIN, totally fine. it happens. My problem is that the ONLY worker who cared to remedy the situation was the handsome black guy. No one was helping him take the weight off of all his orders he was making.The manager himself didn't even seem to care. My problem was not with the mishap, but with the lack of team work I saw at this location. If the manager or corporate is reading this, please find said handsome black guy and give him a raise or something, because he made my morning so much better. I still love Einstein's and obvi I'll come back duh."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had a yummy breakfast. Fast service. Coffee is delicious. Bagel skinny sandwiches were good."}
{"text":"Food-good, service-friendly, cleanliness-awful. If your looking for a clean place to enjoy you coffee and bagel try someplace else! Tables dirty, floor dirty and drink station dirty. Asked staff to wipe down a table because none where clean, she came out and wiped down 1 table and left the rest dirty. REALLY?"}
{"text":"Love Einstein Bros and so do the kids!! The bagels and smoothies are always delicious when we go and the staff are friendly and patient while waiting for you to decide your order. We usually go in the afternoon and have been lucky to have the bagels we want still available. I read a few other reviews about bagels running out by  the afternoon so that makes me a bit nervous for future visits but knock on wood! I would definitely be disappointed though if that happens."}
{"text":"Okay Einstein's store on Camelback and 16th Street, I have to ding you for this. DON'T sweeten the ice tea. Your brewed Spontineatea (or however you spell it) is great WITHOUT the simple syrup. Let customers choose to sweeten their drink if they want. 

I spent $1.99 on a large tea that I couldn't drink without it triggering my gag reflex. Poured most of it down the drain instead. Nasty stuff.

Until you offer plain old unsweetened ice tea I'm not giving you your star back."}
{"text":"the WIFI here has been down 2 of the last three times I've been here over the last month.  I'm using the my hotspot on my phone in a coffee shop, imagine that.   If I can't get WIFI I can't work.  If I can't work, I can't go here.   Reply to this review when the connectivity issues have been resolved and I'll start going there again.   Thanks"}
{"text":"I like Einstein's Bagels but this location is horrible, slow, always out of coffee and seasonal bagels, mean manager and dirty. Will not come back to this location."}
{"text":"I arrived at about 9:35 am with only one person was ahead of me in line.  I ordered a bagel with cream cheese, then waited five minutes (!!!) for the bagel.

Why does it take five minutes to slice a bagel, toast it, then smear cream cheese upon it?  The woman ahead of me only had a bagel with coffee, but she received it within a minute or two.
The bagel was good, but certainly not so good that I should wait five minutes for it.

During the delay, one person was making a bunch of sandwiches, another person was mopping the floor, and only one person was making food for waiting customers.  I hope the management reconsiders its priorities when customers are standing at the counter waiting for their food."}
{"text":"My kids love this place. We come here often.  Bagels are good  so why only 2 stars?  Their operation sucks.  Show up at prime time early morning to buy bagels on a weekend and less than half of the variety of bagel flavors are ready. Not sometimes... every time. so annoying. Here's a tip to the restaurant chain managers, show up d earlier so your product is ready when you open."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for my coworker who I attended the establishment with I would have not been satisfied. The time of service was slow and inaccurate."}
{"text":"Great bagels, great customer service except when we go to the register to pay. Lady named Ginger was extremely rude to me and my wife, told us to hold on in the middle of our order, after that I heard an employee tell her an order and Gingers reply was \" well good luck to him!\" Overall experience was ok except with having to deal with miss Gingers attitude and poor customer service."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have EVER received. After the elderly couple ahead of me ordered (admittedly slowly), I got up to the counter where Josh greeted me, then told me to \"hold on\". That's fine... except he then grabbed his drink and wandered over to the door, where he just sat down for a nice break. What? He couldn't wait 40 seconds for his break?! There wasn't even anybody behind me! I was baffled. The guy making the food had to yell at him to come help me after about 2 minutes of Josh and I exchanging glances. I've never even considered walking out of a place before today. I've received plenty of terrible customer service, but never have I experienced level of don't-give-a-f**k Josh had today. 

To top it off, I got back to work with my lunch only to find that I got the wrong food. Thanks, guys."}
{"text":"My bagel and coffee are great.  Customer service has alot to be desired.  Cashier was very rude and got my order wrong. I ended up paying more and getting less because of way I was rung up. ."}
{"text":"This is a handy location with Starbucks next door. I normally buy a pastry here and my coffee at Starbucks. The bagel breakfast sandwiches are also very good. A relaxing place to hang out in the morning."}
{"text":"I recommend the Bacon / Cheddar Egg Sandwich on a Chile Bagel. Also at the top of my list is the Asiago Bagel Dog. The pastries are always a high quality. I suggest the Strudel or the Cinnamon Sticks."}
{"text":"Not coming back here! Walked in to where it is very clearly posted \"ORDER HERE\" and got in line behind the man already waiting. Two more people came in and stood in line behind me. After a few minutes with no help, an employee says, \"did you all order already?\" We say no, and she proceeds to inform us that the line to order is where you pick up and pay. Oh. Ok. So we move over there. And I notice that as more people enter the store they all go to the very clearly posted \"ORDER HERE\" sign. Suckers. As we wait in the PAY HERE line to order, the two men in front of me left because they were taking so long. When it's my turn to order I walk up and say, \" you guys should cover up the \"ORDER HERE\" sign if we don't actually order there. Her response, \"What?\" So I repeat my self and add, \"people keep coming in and standing over there.\" Her response, nothing. Blank stare. Nobody home. Then she finally says, \"what can I get for you?\" So I order, and then stand over by the \"ORDER HERE\" sign which now is the pick up spot. So confusing! Terrible way to start my lovely Friday morning."}
{"text":"Ordered their new Turkey Cranberry panini without bacon, and I got one spinach leaf, a dab of cranberry sauce and a mediocre turkey lunch meat slice for $8... Not worth it. Very disappointed. Good orange juice though."}
{"text":"Im from California today was my first time hearing of einstein bagels I walked in the girls at the register look at me and start laughing, they looked over at this tall guy with black hair like help. 
He came from where he was behind the counter and start standing like a security guard. I am 57 years old I am a nurse would never hurt anyone. I guess because I'm black with braids and 6 feet tall I'm a theif. But I guess they looked stupid because I handed them my platinum American express no limit baby card and left them there making sandwich they need to go in training. Because that is no way to treat anyone who is giving u business I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Worst bagels I have ever had. Egg was not fully cooked and the customer service was worse."}
{"text":"Bagels are extremely small and overpriced

Good decor

Horrible customer service

Egg mixture tasted spoiled"}
{"text":"Wow ~ what a busy place, especially on a Sunday morning ~ yet even with the rush of people the staff stayed pretty friendly and the food came out quickly.  Einstein Bagels has really stepped up their game ~ they have coffee bar drinks that rivel Starbucks  . . . their latte may actually be better : )  PLUS you can refill your cup with their drip coffee that tasted fantastic.

They are now featuring new lite and healthy selections featuring bagels that on 1/2 the thickness to save on calories.  I tried their veggie with mushrooms and asparages.  It was terrific!

Competition is good sometimes ~ in this case having several other breakfast locations in the area has really invited Einsteins to step up and re-invent itself.  It's exciting to see their rebirth and growth.

Blessings : )KC"}
{"text":"All I wanted was a freaking bagel.I don't mind waiting but I don't want to be ignored. If you don't want my money no problem I'll take it elsewhere. This store clearly has a customer service 
Issue that needs to be addressed."}
{"text":"Seems to me that this particular branch needs more help. Busy street people like to have a quick bite. But this place does not deliver that. I am a fan of Einstein bagel. I have been to another busier branch, service was quick and fast. My I feel sorry for the girls that work here. My suggestion, if management is even reading yelp reviews. This branch needs more help. You can see tension on those girl. Orders get mixed up with."}
{"text":"Adriana, the store manager, is great. She remembered my name after only two visits. Fast service with a smile. Always have my favorite bagels available. I never wait in line as they are very efficient. Go in and get a bagel. Great coffee too."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the bagels are FRESH!  My favorite is the turkey, bacon, avocado sandwich.  When you go there enough, they start to remember your name!"}
{"text":"friendly staff, clean store, excellent ham & cheese bagel melt.  staff was very enthusiastic and welcoming. great job!  visited for the first time yesterday.  i will be back."}
{"text":"Einstein's back home in Chicago was great but i have been very disappointed by the Einstein's in this area. Not only in terms of quality of food, but quality of service both of them are horrid here in Las Vegas. I hate to say it but I can no longer rely on Einstein's for a good bagel breakfast."}
{"text":"We love how fresh & flavorful their bagels are, great variety too! Get there early or they'll be sold out."}
{"text":"\"happiness is a warm bagel\" says the girl's shirt working behind the counter. Amen I say!  As you drive up to this very busy parking lot you will notice a line out the door.  Hey this is the neighborhood digs!  don't let it fool you...these peeps are on top of their game-why else would people wait outside waiting to get in the door? 

Today, just a regular day where I find myself dreaming about what I'm gonna get while I peer in the window to a packed house.  I get through the line and there she is...Wendy...the manager I think.  This girl may not know me from Adam but she is consistently happy to serve with her smiles....no matter how crazy busy the place is she is never frazzled.  Consistent customer service had by all.  

So I order my sesame bagel toasted with vege cream cheese.  Simple and delish!!!  Out the door in 20 minutes.  Not too bad considering I started my wait outside.

Their bagels are always fresh.  I have ordered a variety of things here and everything is great.  The store is clean, the customers are friendly as well as the staff. I would have to say Einstiens is a staple breaksfast spot in our book and thank goodness it's close to the house!"}
{"text":"Their computer system was down today and they were ALL  amazing - multi-tasking, hustling, friendly, helpful, and patient. I can't say the same for the rude customers. The GM and Manager were exceptional! Way to go everyone!"}
{"text":"If you think these are good bagels, you've never had a good bagel.  I wouldn't even call what they serve bagels.  Unfortunately, where I work they bring these in for various occasions so I'm guessing they're cheap.

If you're from NY/NJ area don't waste your time or money - you'll be chucking this in the trash after one bite.

Disgusting."}
{"text":"Eh. Idk why people come here so often, there are other places to get real bagels people! Im pretty sure everything here is frozen, if not it sure tastes like it is. This place doesn't need our money. Try going to a local business with authentic bagels instead of this rich low-quality chain that makes the same bagel here as it does in its NYC locations. I doubt any New Yorkers would waste their money on these wannabe bagels. Kind of lowers the standards for the American bagel, but if you like cheap quality food like McDonald's then this place is for you"}
{"text":"Yesterday morning a co-worker was going to make a bagle run to this location.  I asked her to bring me a blueberry bagel with strawberry cream cheese.  I got the bagel and started eating the bottem half, got almost halfway through it and noticed something that resembled brownish yellow wings.   I scooped it off the bagel  and looked more closely and saw that it had legs too!  

I immediately went back to the shop and asked for the manager.  When he appeard I showed it to him.  His called for another employeed to come and refund me my monehy, further adding, \"We are aware of the problem, it is in the packaging from our distributor and we are working on resolving it.\"  So THEY ARE AWARE THEY HAVE BUGS/ROACHES IN THEIR CREAM CHEESE BUT CONTINUE TO SERVE TO CUSTOMERS ANYWAY!

 I have also filed a complaint with the Maricopa Department of Environmental Services which will be sending someone in to investigate the location and it's problem.  For your safety and those you care about, DON'T EAT HERE.... And WARN OTHERS TOO!"}
{"text":"When there is one around me I would eat my lunch there. I love their Italian Chicken Panini. I never really liked bagels that much until I came here. Now I'm addicted! Since then I've eaten almost everything on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is my spot. Drip coffee that is the best in town, go with the bold European blend or the Vanilla blend. Love those egg bagel sandwiches, the turkey sausage or the spinach mushroom swiss are the best in my opinion. The service is quick, and the staff is extremely friendly. They even know me by name in there. I do love this place."}
{"text":"It is my new go-to bagel place.  Cheaper than Bruegger's and bigger with better parking, and people are consistently friendly.  Their lox is quite good.  No issues and no complaints.  Good for a quick morning bite when heading to work."}
{"text":"I had a very disappointing experience at this location. I came in for the dozen bagels for $7 and when I walked in they had no more then 2 or 3 flavors available . They had not one drink option displayed or cream cheese like they are supposed to . We gave our options of flavors we would like and the guy told us it will be about 20 min bc the baker needs to make them . I'm not sure why they didn't already have that going since they didn't have any bagels displayed ! So we waited for our turn in line to pay and there was a couple in front of us and a huge line behind us . As workers were walking by doing other things it took them 10 min to finally ring up the couple In front  of us . When it was our turn they didn't even have the right order. While we waited the 20 min we went to the Albertsons real fast to get some things and came back in time. Our bagels were still not ready and the baskets were still empty. We waited another 25 min and when I see other customers receiving their dozen at the time of order I was very displeased . I finally went up to the front , and asked when ours were ready . The boy apologized and got them ready for us . He was the only one up there, not sure where the other workers disappeared to . All I know is I will NEVER come back to this location ever again . The counters were dirty and un wiped. It needs new management or these kids need better training ."}
{"text":"Service at this Einstein's location was terrible. 7 a.m. Friday morning - only three employees, working in desultory fashion, with no sense of interest or urgency. Line was six, seven  people deep when I arrived. 15 minutes later I had moved one spot forward. Bagels were absent in half of the bins. Three customers left (Including me) without any contact or service. While I was on site Management was completely absent. I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Since my first review I have come to LOVE this place. They always have everything, great coffee and tea and friendly staff. 
Why I am changing my tune is because they helped me out when they did not have to.
Trying to place an order early one morning for myself and my work team. 4 drinks and select bagels. Get the order in and low and behold when I move to the other register to pay, my wallet is gone. It had already been a rough morning as my car would not start and my hair would not cooperate. 
What changed my day around was my experience at this store. At first they were going to give me one coffee for free as I was frantically looking in my purse for loose cash. Then before they could say anything more, I ran out of the store to look for the spare cash I keep in my car. After flying in and out of there like a mad woman, so relived I had found cash, my entire order was ready. Before I could explain that I had money in the car, the manager and team walked around and handed me my bagels and all my drinks. The lovely manager explains that he had already started the order before I realized my wallet was not in my purse. Although I insisted I pay he says, \"Miss, we all have days like this and I couldn't let you leave without your coffee. Its on the house.\"
THAT does not happen. In a world of me, me, me this man just helped another human being out. It was that simple. He had nothing to gain, other than my respect, his team's respect and the 10 other customers in the store's respect. Why I choose this one for my morning breakfast and coffee and tea is because I want to give my business where by business is appreciated, but also where the mentality is that customers come first and helping people with kind heart is a priority."}
{"text":"Worst place I have been too. They get our order wrong every Single time we go there. They always are out of the most popular bagels. I have complained to the management thru phone, and email with no response. This is 3 minutes from my house but refuse to go there"}
{"text":"The staff were friendly but the dining area was a bit of a mess. We had just come in after lunch time but for the 25-30 minutes we were there, no one came out to clean or empty the overflowing garbages... As usual, the sandwiches were delicious although I had to go back to the counter to get some things they forgot. All in all, good food but needs some more attention given to the dining area"}
{"text":"Worst experience here ever!  I ordered a toasted cinnamon bagel with cream cheese.  Before taking a single bite I noticed a small hair in the middle . When I got it replaced the second bagel was very cold in the middle and on top of that had a piece of egg in it on the back! I requested a refund and was given the wrong amount back (less ) than I paid. The manager processed my refund and didn't even offer a single apology. The tables were dirty as was the bathroom and counters. Along with the makeshift lemon holder by the water ( dirty rusty and not the proper lid ) this place had red flags everywhere. And I'm still hungry . Oh and there's not a zero star rating huh ?"}
{"text":"Love Ann and her crew ... I'm never disappointed with my service :) ... my favorite is the hazelnut coffee and sausage egg and cheese"}
{"text":"As an on-the-way hangover breakfast spot, it does the job. But if you are searching for a quality breakfast place, I would suggest exploring other options. The service was friendly. When I got my bagel the cheese wasn't melted, and on a toasted bagel sandwich that is a must, is it not? I asked them to melt the cheese and they were happy to complete my request. The egg was questionable, but otherwise I was satisfied."}
{"text":"Einsteins has these GREAT Lo-Cal thin bagel breakfast  under 300 cal.  The one I tried had mushrooms asparagas with swiss cheese and egg white and a yummy sauce. Large  Iced non fat sugar free latte perfect way to start my day after a work out!! Very friendly employees!!  Very FAST service!! They also handed me a bunch of coupons to come back.  VERY Impressed. Total bill a little over $9.00 but now I have some 2 for 1 coupons!!"}
{"text":"Won't come back.. poor service, waited 20 mins just for them to tell me there sold out of the bagel I asked for even tho the person who ordered after me was eating a bagel. Got my bagel, coffee ws cold by this time person behind the register was yelling at employee to get to work in front of customers... plenty of other bagel places to choose from in vegas."}
{"text":"I love bagels and I love their fresh dliscious bagels. I have never had a six cheese bagel like the one from here. Always my stop for breakfast in the morning on my way to work. Love it!"}
{"text":"Slows service, 25 minutes for 1 bagel... And while I waited got a nice view of behind the counter, which was disgusting.  Next tome I'll go the extra four blocks to the Nosh. Better bagel anyway!"}
{"text":"Now that the GM is present this location is making a come back! People smiling and polite. Nice job"}
{"text":"Went to this location to use our BOGO bagel sandwich coupon. At 8am this location was out of everything bagels and they were out of blueberry muffins. Our last 4 visits between 7 and 8 am they have not had blueberry muffins. In addition to our visit on 11/18/16 I observed cooked eggs and deli meat sitting on the white cutting board while the staff was waiting for the bagels. We keep going because of the location but after this last visit we will try the location on  Thunderbird."}
{"text":"Closed. Sad.

Replaced with ANOTHER Starbucks.... sigh."}
{"text":"The staff here are nice and I waited to write this until I gave other chances. They always seem flustered. This location is the closest to my work and every time I have come here I have ended up being late to work. Today I worked at 7:30 so I arrived at 7:08am. I work 7 min away so as long as I had my food by 7:23 I'd be on time. After waiting and waiting (I was the first person in line this whole time) my order was finally taken at 7:19 and I paid at 7:24. It would be another 2 min before my food was ready. I have a nova lox and my bagel was supposed to be toasted and it was not, and the was barely any cream cheese. I think toaster strudels come with more icing. The staff was apologetic and nice but I'm going to have to go somewhere else in order to make it to work on time, because unfortunately this is my 3rd experience where I was made late."}
{"text":"OK, I am not a fan of fast food anyway, but I do remember eating bagels on occasion from Einstein in the past and enjoying them.  This visit however, had me thinking that the product has been cheapened over the years. 
Service was quick and friendly but the first bad sign was that they didn't have real butter for my bagel, only a butter substitute, which is just not my thing.  I ordered a cinnamon apple bagel and the way it was put together made it very difficult to eat, because the apple pieces were rather large chunks that kept dropping onto the ground as I bit into the bagel.  Luckily I was eating it outside :)
The part of the bagel that had been under the apple was very doughy as though it hadn't baked properly.  On top of that it had perhaps been stored to close to the savory bagels because I would occasionally get a bite that tasted strongly of garlic.  Ick!"}
{"text":"I think this Einstein bagel shop is really dirty and will not go back"}
{"text":"We enjoy having breakfast on a bagel with a great cup of coffee there.  It has a quick & very pleasant service.  A great variety of bagels that look like they just came out of the oven.   They also offer other choices, ie, juice, yogurt, fruit, etc.
It's a small eatery with bench seats and tables.   Also some tables are available outside.
They have takeout, as well."}
{"text":"Jenny loves smiles!  And it shows!  First of all, the coffee was hot, and I mean hot!  But, let's be honest, it is supposed to be!  The bagel was very good, perfectly toasted, and when I asked if I could order an extra side of veggie schmear, she said \"absolutely\"! (free of charge!)
The customer service was excellent, the restaurant was clean, and Jenny-you are very good at your job,  it shows through all of your employees.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Wow!! I am absolutely surprised about the terrible expirience i had here i took my 4 kids to have a good lunch since i have been going to the location in tempe on mcklintok and guadalupe and have had nothing but good food and service but i wa sinnthis area not only did we get uncooked olain bagels but i also got a turkey sandwich when i had asked for ham after telling the cashier it was wrong she got mas and said what did u order then and changed it made the wrong thing again and the. When i showed her bagels were still raw she said oaky what do you want thenn and i felt terrible and said just give me my money back and told my kids sorry we will have to ho elsewhere my special needs son was already eating chips and salad so he got upset i never got a im sorry from her and asked for the gm she did apologize and offer to make others but with the awkward feeling we were not upto staying there and feel bad about what had happened here we r now at kneaders habinga. Great lunch never will i go there again so unfortunate to habe people woth this attitude working at a food place"}
{"text":"Service has improved. Last two times no complaints and food is good. I stick to lox and bagel though-not sure about anything else."}
{"text":"For the love of God, run the blender in the back or get a soundproof case. The whole place stops and plugs their ears when you fire that thing up. My ears are still ringing..."}
{"text":"There aren't many bagel places to choose from in the area, and I've definitely have had better while living in California and abroad. However, their bagels aren't bad, and I've been there several times to bring some to work. Every once in a while I'll get the lox and bagel, which is one of my favorite sandwiches. I like how they serve it open face because it can be pretty thick when put together as a sandwich. The bagels do taste fresh so they definitely get a big plus for that!"}
{"text":"Service really sucks at this place. The two high school (it seemed like it) girls didn't seem to care. When I asked about the discount, she said, I don't know nothing about no discounts.\" I think that says it all. Unfortunately, there aren't many bagel places here and I will go back to other stores because their bagels are decent."}
{"text":"Dear Einstein, 

I like your bagels! Your locations are very convenient. However, when I pay $7 for a bagel and lox - I expect there to be more than two fish scales. In the future, please inform your employees to not make excuses based on the weight of the bagel for less lox. Then an offer for an additional $5 for two more measly pieces that were expected in the first place. Einstein, you may be a theoretical bagel-living genius, but you really dropped the ball this time! In the words of Arnold, I'll be back. 

Thanks for the pickle, 

David"}
{"text":"Used to be a regular customer here when Jen was the manager but it seems like everything's falling apart since Jen left they no longer make their iced coffee fresh its pre-packaged and they don't have a lot of the flavored creamers That I Used to Love. I still stop in to pick up Bagels occasionally but I visit much less frequently since things have changed. I love the salmon and cream cheese on the bagels though I can't stop eating those."}
{"text":"We order bagels  wich they were super fresh and really good taste .  W3 order pkain ones, cheese ones and jalapeño with cheese , this one  was my favorite one .  Eat it alone,  pair it with coffee or hot chocolate    . Yummm!"}
{"text":"Walked into this place and 3 people standing behind counter with one at register. One behind register didn't acknowledge me and walked away .  One person finally asked if I had been helped and proceeded to take my order. My order was prepared but he walked away without taking payment and said another individual would take payment. Was given my sandwich and I had to tell them I still haven't paid. He kept yelling to a female. She finally came up front to take payment. When I commented on there disorganization there was no apology.
After I ate the sandwich I was still hungry so I went back in for the same order -apple smoked bacon, pepper jack, 1 egg and cream cheese on an onion bagel.
I went to the same register I went to the first time. I kept looking at the employees and nobody acknowledged. Other customers walked in the door. The light bulb finally went on as I had not seen the sign before where I was originally standing under said pay here. It should have been a \"duh\" moment but in all my experience this setup is backwards from most other stores which they have the ordering counter up front after you walk in the door. Well being this is my first time in this store imagine my surprise. Regardless of my ignorance about the backwards setup, an employee should have acknowledged and pointed that out to me. So I stood in  the proper line to order and the man behind the counter was pleasant and took my order and then of course I went to the pay here register.
Overall the experience was poor. It cost me $5.40 for the first sandwich and $6.90 for the second. Why the price difference for the same sandwich?  Well the first time I asked for cream cheese after they took my order so I was given a side. Little did I realize they charge$1.50 for cream cheese. What a ripoff. 
So in total I paid  $12.30 for breakfast. The next person who says fast food is cheap should think again."}
{"text":"Ever had salmon on a bagel? I'm sure you've had. 

I just can't get enough of the Nova Lox at Einstein's. It comes with cream cheese, tomato & raw onion slices, and just the right amount of capers. Just one bite and you will be hooked. You get to pick what kind of bagels you like and I know it sounds weird because it is sweet on a savory bagel (the cashiers always go like, are you sure? Yes! I am sure!) but I always pick the cinnamon raison bagel. In the words of Rachel Ray, \"Yum-O\". 

I've tried the caramel macchiato today; since I was already too late to stop at Starbucks. I don't know if they were missing the caramel or the macchiato or both to it because it just tastes like warm milk. I'd asked for soy, too. Had a tummy ache. :(

But it is okay, I end up not finishing my \"tall drink\". Btw, tall is (as far as I know) the only term for Starbucks for) small size. But I consumed all my bagel just in time until the boss walked into the office today."}
{"text":"The only complaint I have and I am sure those that don't understand will be making comments, is, I asked if they have military discounts and I was told no but the lady next to me received a senior citizens  discount .
   Does this put me off , YES, I understand the reason behind senior discounts but REALLY, people that have fought and some like myself that have received injuries so companies like this can operate in the UNITED STATES get dismissed . 
  No sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Staff is so young and not ready. Not sure if employment is a challenge in this area but all kids running the place. No smile and no common sense. Hope the owner turn things around quickly."}
{"text":"I like their coffee.  I believe it is some of the best for a corporate joint, but...

The quality of workers has declined since school started back up.  I hate to say it, but the black guy and the creepy-looking old guy just don't cut it, especially when there is no one there at 2 in the afternoon and they can't get my order of a single bagel with schmear right.  I'll wait until they get more help or school gets out again.

Edit: They have cleaned up service a bit.  Haven't had a single problem in several months."}
{"text":"Einstein's is an okay chain.  It's not my favorite but in a pinch, it can hit the spot.  This location, however, leaves a lot to be desired.  I've stopped in multiple times due to the convenient location but I always leave disappointed.  

The food here is the standard Einstein's fare.  I'm not a real bagel fan but I have sampled a few of the breakfast sandwiches.  They were okay, nothing memorable.  I usually stop in for a coffee or a latte.

This last visit really made me mad.  I ordered a hot chai latte and ended up leaving with something else (never figured out what the drink was).  Unfortunately, I was a good ways down the road before the drink had cooled enough for me to take a sip.  Aaargh!

What really annoys me about this location is the lack of customer service.  I've found that the folks working behind the counter are rather gruff and unfriendly. On this last visit, the young lady didn't greet me and refused to look me in the eye.  It's been a similar story with my previous visits.  The store seems to stay fairly busy in the morning hours.  I don't know if this contributes to the service problem or not.  Either way, I've made my final visit.  I can get a hot drink elsewhere."}
{"text":"Avoid this Einstein!! I work near this location and I periodically stop by to grab breakfast before heading into work. I keep on giving this location a chance but decided to only go to the location on Rainbow & Flamingo from now on
(AWESOME customer service!!!). 

I'm always greeted with what seems to be a torturous smile and good morning from their manger (red head woman who always seems to be disheveled). I place my order, pay and wait for my name to be called. Why is it that I need to wait 13 minutes to get a toaster nova lox and bagel sandwich (there was only 4 people in front of me in line)? Why is it that I specifically asked for my bagel to be toasted and its not? Why is it that the people in line after me get their order before me??  Why is it that when I order coffee their creamer is ALWAYS out??

Come on?? Get it together!!!
I feel the only reason they have business is because of its location. 
Nothings wrong with taking a little pride in your job?! Just saying!!!"}
{"text":"Einstein Bros has a wide variety of bagels & sandwiches. I am not familiar with the chain, but I really like this location. Their customer service is stellar. The environment is very nice--big windows with lots of light and open seating. The only problem is they have no outlets if you need to plug in a computer."}
{"text":"Since we moved to Cave Creek three years ago we have tried making Einstein's our neighborhood coffee shop. At first we tried overlooking the young, untrained staff. After a few management changes we keep going back hoping the service will improve.
Now, however, despite lots of very young staff who are friendly and somewhat helpful, the food it getting carelessly bad and the restrooms are filthy.
Time to look for a new hangout.
Forget the Einstein's at Desert Ridge. One time we went there they were so busy, we queued up in line behind everyone else while the young staff completely ignored the line.
Finally, a customer told us they were not taking orders at the usual register, but rather at the check out register. There were no signs informing customers and no help from the clueless staff.
These stores never have grown ups on site to supervise."}
{"text":"This Einstein's is the best neighborhood Einstein's ever. They are always quick with a smile and yes to donations. Recently they were able to support our walk in for #redfored at Cocopah Middle Schools with bagels. I can't thank them enough."}
{"text":"This is a super mediocre Einstein Bros Bagels.  For reasons I can't understand, there is always a very long line, the food takes forever (even a simple bagel w/ cream cheese), and it never seems clean (probably because staff are always trying to attack the absurdly long line).

My last visit ended up with my getting the wrong order. Of course, we didn't get home until I realized, so we called and the phone rang and rang and rang until it automatically disconnected me.  On the third try, someone answered and they instantly acknowledged that they gave us the wrong order.  I said I'd be back, reluctantly as they didn't offer to comp us next time or refund our money for the completely wrong order, in 10 minutes to get the right order.  The employee said sure, no problem, we won't make you wait in line again.

Well, after being ignored for a few minutes, I joined the line, finally got an employee to look at me so I could say who I was, and I got my order, sans an apology/thank you for coming back.  My supposed-to-be-hot order was cold.  It was clear they never remade the order, and that they gave me what they had made, at this point, over an hour ago.

Thanks for making me drive twice to pick up soggy food that I threw in the trash."}
{"text":"Worst einsteins ever. I've been here several times and probably won't be back. They are so slow it's ridiculous. They move with no sense of urgency no matter how many people are waiting. There was one guy making stuff with multiple orders in line while several people in back doing nothing."}
{"text":"Okay so day two I come here to get the santa fe egg wrap at my wife's request, (she is in the hospital) On day ONE of being completely ignored by AJ. He walked past me twice, never said a word, then went behind the counter where i was waiting to order and still walked right by. Finally a very pleasant girl came out form the back and took my order. Day two AJ is again there again ignoring me while I stood at the order counter and attended the drink machine still ignoring me. Finally the real pleasant guy Keith? came out and took my order. WOW very disappointing!"}
{"text":"$4.80 for a breakfast sandwich seems a bit much to me given what you get.  Outside of that the place was acceptably clean and seemed decently busy."}
{"text":"I stood at the checkout for over three minutes waiting to be acknowledged. There was one couple being served, so It wasn't busy. I ordered a large iced tea and when I finally paid, I went to fill my cup, and no iced tea. I told the cashier and she said she would brew some but she did nothing. 5 employees stood around shooting the breeze while I waited for my order. When I finally received my order, still no iced tea. I've been standing here with my to go order for over 10 minutes, waiting for my iced tea while my food goes uneaten. Nothing was offered to compensate me for my time, not even an apology. It's a good thing I'm not on my way to work, because I would be freaking livid. Last time I will come here- I'd rather drive the extra distance to the Thunderbird location."}
{"text":"How does a bagel place run out of plain bagles? In fact they were out of 10 different types, no selection, it's Saturday were going to be busy how about making more bagels? Whomever is in charge of baking needs to find another job. I used to go there alot. Kind of bummed it went down hill. Tables were filthy, had to wipe my table off and watched another customer ask for a wet towel to wipe his table off, gross. Need to find a new place to take the family."}
{"text":"I ordered bagel with strawberry, they put almond .... If you ordered bagel thing they give you regular bagel ???? What happened ?"}
{"text":"Had never been to this location, nor will I return. Appears they don't have either enough employees or ones that work well together. Took FOREVER to get my order, and incredibly got home with the wrong order.... Just wasn't convenient. I love Einsteins... Just not this one...."}
{"text":"About what one would expect from a conglomerate fast food chain as far as the food quality goes, but what was especially remarkable today was the very poor customer service. I sat outside, and when the employee brought my lunch out and did not bring a fork, she acted almost joyous that she got to tell me that I have to go inside to get my own fork. She will have no future in customer service I'm sure of that.

This was at 2:30 on 11/2/13."}
{"text":"If I could rate the service and cleanliness of this store as a negative rating I would but I give it a 1 just to give it something.  
My family and I had visited this location 2 weeks ago on a trip to Vegas, and even though the bathrooms were totally filthy we were at least happy with the food.  This last weekend, we were in Vegas again and I insisted that we eat there. We were there Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  Each day, we had to clean our own table before eating as the eating area wasn't clean. 
On Sunday, we all sat to eat (6 of us) and when I left, I accidentally left my purse on the chair at the table. I noticed I had left my purse there literally 1 block and 1/2 away from the store, drove back like a crazy person.  When I came back, I ran inside to see if the purse was still at the table and started asking employees if they had seen it.  One employee said that she had not seen anything, that she didn't clean the table that it was another girl who was on break. She suggested I speak with the manager, who said she didn't know anything.  When the girl who was on break came back in the store I asked her if she had seen anything when she clean the table, she said she hadn't clean the table that it was the other girl. I asked the manager if I could see the security tape to see if a customer picked up the purse, etc.  The \"manager\" said she had to call someone (another manager maybe) to see if we could see the tapes. I waited 45 minutes for the other manager to call back, never did.  During the 45 min that I was there not one of the employees came up to us to see if we were ok, offer any help or even a glass of water.  Only person who came up to us, trying to help was one of the customers, a really nice gentleman who said he had seen us there earlier but did not see if someone took the purse.  
I'm glad I didn't wait for the \"So called manager\" to call back and see if we could see the security tapes... I'd probably still be waiting.
On the positive side, my purse did show up, a wonderful, honest, kind, loving lady picked it up for me, called my bank (I had already reported my cards as lost) and the bank got me in touch with her.  Nothing was missing from my purse.  You don't come across honest people like my new friend!"}
{"text":"I have to say I agree with the review of this Einstein's about the line problem, and also I agree that the signage is bad.

Lines are confusing, they do handle crowds fairly well but I've noticed that on weekend mornings can take a long time to get your food.  The coffee isn't great either (very weak).  I usually get my coffee somewhere before going here for the food.  I go here because it's convenient and it has a nice sunny patio with lots of tables and chairs.  The manager and employees seem nice.  The Lox and Cream Cheese bagel sandwich is to die for.  It took several visits before I was offered a customer card that would have given me a jump on discounts.  Apparently you're supposed to notice it among all the hubbub while ordering and paying for your food and trying not to hold up the line.  They should ask when ringing you up if you have a card."}
{"text":"Won't go to this location again. The guy who took my order was chomping on gum and was by the food. The main thing that ticked me off was that when I order something and my order matches the receipt, my order should be right. I leave thinking my order was correct and once I got home it wasn't. I ordered a egg cheese and turkey sausage on poppy seed bagel with cream cheese. Why does my bagel only have egg and cheese on it???!!! I don't get it. There is a screen right in front of your faces that tell you so you don't have to memorize."}
{"text":"Einstein, what is it you make?  bagels right? Is it reasonable to expect there might be bagels to purchase say as a sandwich at 1:00  on Saturday? I stopped in for a sandwich on Saturday and you had about 5 bagels to choose from, yah two of those ickey asaigo cheese things, two pumpernickel and a challah bun. That was all. I asked when I might be able to get say sesame or everything or plain and was told it would be about twenty minutes. Really 20 minutes? It only takes about 12 minutes to bake a bagel so in other words you don't plan to make any more. wtf Einstein's I didn't go there to buy cream cheese. I won't bother to stop again. smucks."}
{"text":"Early on  Sunday morning we had many Bagel places to chose from, but this Location was new and closest to our home so we thought we'd give it a try.   Walked in @7:30am and wasn't busy, after we ordered, my husband, who is usually quiet, couldn't help but notice how filthy the glass case was. Then pointed out the counter and trash, as if it had not been cleaned from the day before.  When We politely mentioned it to the gal that took our order she just stared at us.  So I took my cup and went to get my coffee and it was empty!  At 7:30 on a Sunday morning!!  NO Thank you and we will not be returning!"}
{"text":"We come to this location several times a week and they're always out of their premium bagels. At some point, don't you make more in anticipation? No matter what time of day, unless it's very early, they're out. Won't return even though this is right in our neighborhood, because of this. Get it together, guys!"}
{"text":"This is purely a service review. Food is good up to the Einstein Bros franchise expectations. Coffee is great, which is why I come back occasionally.

Service is consistently poor. I ordered. Garlic bagel w/ garlic shmear, TOASTED and a medium coffee to go. I emphasized toasted to the cashier girl taking my order. My bagel as NOT TOASTED. The person putting on the shmear couldn't align the lopsided bagel properly.  I had to rotate the bagel top to match the bottom in order to avoid getting shmear all over my hands. I had to wait to pay because the girl at the register was cleaning trays instead of getting people through the line. I had my bagel and I still had to wait for her. 

On a separate occasion, I made the same over the phone to go for immediate pick up. My order was not ready. The staff of 2 seemed a bit lost and totally apathetic. 

Honestly, how hard is it to toast a bagel and put on cream cheese?!"}
{"text":"Every time I come in they make my order to perfection and they have the nicest staff!! They always make sure to make you feel welcomed!!"}
{"text":"This location is very disappointing.  The last time I went, they were out of the coffee I always come for, every table was dirty, and the guy at the counter definitely doesn't belong in customer service.  I don't even think he said hi when I approached the counter, just waited for me to order - awkward.  I will say, I could drink the Vanilla Hazelnut coffee and eat the Lox & Bagel everyday for the rest of my life.  Since this one is closest to where I live, I really hope they fix a couple things so it could be as great as the other locations."}
{"text":"I go into Einstein bagels for their Monday special of 13 bagels and 2 cream cheese for 13$. The service is always friendly and quick. Plus its tough to beat that deal."}
{"text":"We stopped going there sometime ago the bagels just were not East Coast bagels like they say. I don't know if its the water they use  We started to go to Chompies but just recently we decided to go back and get a bakers dozen on Monday morning 6$ bucks and garfunkeled like 7 of them on the patio with our favorite cream cheese, my wife was ecstatic. Holy makrel the bagels were outstanding. We almost could not stop eating them. The customer service was also back to par. The girl with the dirty blond hair was so courteous and actually smiled, wish I got her name . We need smiles at our age so it was nice seeing the staff smiling. We also had a 6 cheese and spinach gourmet bagel that actually tasted gourmet. I am glad that we came back and hope to keep coming back.. Our snow bird friends are gonna love it when they come and visit. Thank you Einstein bagels for getting your groove back and for the awesome east coast bagels,and service. Bye Chompies we wont be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I agree with Joanie H. 

Good food, but long lines and grumpy employees. I watched one customer behind me (there were 6 people in line behind me, only three people behind the counter) leave, get in her car and drive to Starbucks a block away. The young lady behind the cash register obviously was not happy to have to work this morning, customers are not greeted when they enter the store, nor do any of the workers smile."}
{"text":"Tasty bagels, large selection, coffee is really good! Bagel size is small to medium - had bigger. Comfortable setting, like the grab-n-go bucket concept."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, things have changed at the 215/Flamingo location.  Our family has been going to this location for at least 6 years.  We stopped going when they stopped making the iced coffee homemade.  Now it's shipped from corporate in a pre mix packet.  That was around May of '17.  I got a groupon so thought we'd try again.  Walked in at 10 am, the place was pretty quiet...went to order and found there were no bagels available...15 min. Wait...the line started to  go out the door...a new manager, who was doing  everything looked overwhelmed....
Nobody knew how to make hot chocolate, or any other hot drinks. Got to check out and the groupon coupons would not come up on my phone.  The place is now a disorganized mess.  No cinnamin, vanilla,  creamers, what a shame.  Jen, the former manager left and the place is in terrible shape.  Too bad."}
{"text":"I've never been one to go out of my way to complain and yet this is the first place that I've been to making me feel inclined and responsible to do so. As my boyfriend, our friend, and I were sat eating our food, a man came up to us and made fun of my skin color, called us fat, said we were ugly, and then proceeded to try and throw coffee at our service dog. I went to the management and told them the situation, requesting they ask the man to leave. He was walking around harassing many more people than just us and people were having to yell at him because of how bad it was getting. The management told me they would \"keep an eye on him\" and entirely ignored the situation. They should have taken the initiative to provide an environment where people felt at minimum safe to visit. This is an extremely concerning lack of action towards a situation where an animal was threatened and people were being verbally harassed inches from their face."}
{"text":"Foods always pretty decent if you're willing to wait 20 minutes to get it, you think they'd have more than 4 people working than place with the line out the door"}
{"text":"This place is so poorly run and soooo dirty. Everyone runs around like a chicken with their head cut off in the morning and it is so unorganized. Waiting 20 minutes for a bagel is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"My room mate and I go in frequently to grab coffee and a bite.  They have some great flavored coffees at their coffee bar....(my roomie even thinks they're better than Starbucks!)...and cheaper!  The food is pretty good too...not the best..but pretty good.  They have tables outside that make for good places to sit and read when it is nice out....."}
{"text":"I went into Einstein Bros. bagels today because I needed coffee and I didn't feel like driving to Coffee Bean so I decided to be spontaneous and try something new. 

The menu is a little overwhelming to someone in a time crunch who had never been there before so I stood trying to decide for far too long. I let the lady behind me go ahead while I tried to make a choice. When she was done I ordered my iced vanilla latte with whole milk and was told they don't have whole milk. (Seriously what's with Arizona not having whole milk anywhere?!) i ordered it anyway. I was still indecisive and sort of hoped the guy taking my order would show some initiative and make a suggestion. He didn't. I finally decided on a bacon and egg bagel and tried to make some jokes to get him to smile. I got nothing. He must be a robot. He finished up my order and I waited. 

I was happy that I didn't wait long but my coffee was terrible. Seriously awful. Vanilla milk water. I can't even taste espresso. The bagel was okay. It was edible at best. Nothing to be anywhere near impressed with. For a place that prides itself in bagels I expected so much more. 

I should have made the trip to coffee bean."}
{"text":"Great place for some morning coffee n food! Nice view when sitting outside and convenient place to meet n talk w friends! Get there before the 9am morning rush and your bagels will be ready in a snap and no lines to wait in! What else can I say it's Einstein Bagels! They have awesome bagels n spreads!"}
{"text":"Cleaner than most locations. Very very busy during lunch times. Good bagels as always. Lots of over priced food but if you get just a bagel and cream cheese, it's a decent buy."}
{"text":"A great location for this generic chain restaurant. I go almost every morning for a bagel and cream cheese (everything else is over priced). I love that they add veggies for free to your bagel. They are usually really quick to make your order, but sometimes there are insanely long lines...i'm talking lines that are coming out of the door. This happens in the morning (8-9) and at lunch time (11-1)."}
{"text":"This location is a joke.   10:30am on a Saturday and out of all decent savory bagels to make a sandwich, line nearly to the door and barely moving, fountain machine not working, and less than friendly service.   I will make sure to choose a different location next time!"}
{"text":"Seriously? How do you not have bagels? No cinnamon raisin not even plain? They offered a potato bagel. No. Quality gets worse every week - now they don't even make enough. Not going back anymore.  Annoying."}
{"text":"Wonderful sandwiches here! I was pleasantly surprised with the generous seating space also. The tables are not crammed together. I love the variety of healthy options they now offer. But most importantly, the staff and management at this location are really something. They were so helpful when I was having trouble with a groupon I had purchased and were patient with me and very nice. It is very rare to see that kind of customer service and care these days. I also want to add that the place was very clean and there were quite a fee customers too. Well done. I will for sure be back for a delicious egg white turkey bagel."}
{"text":"A disappointment.

This location was oddly pretty dead at 8-am Thursday morning compared to any other Einstein's locations we've been to. I shortly knew why.

The customer was service was awful. We waited in line as no one was taking orders and one person was taking payments. So we formed a line with people behind us- and the cashier walked away and another register opened. An employee came and started to take orders without acknowledging the fact we had been waiting first.  

So we patiently waiting back \"in line.\" She took our order, she wasn't helpful pointing out items that we couldn't locate or answering questions.

We got our food Togo. After spending 12 minutes inside for two breakfast sandwiches we were continued to be disappointed. We had a bagel which wasn't even toasted and then the other sandwich has cold cheese on a hot sandwich! How do you have a hot sandwich with no melted cheese!"}
{"text":"I stopped at this location for lunch and they have a bunch of kids working there that don't know what they are doing.  I even tried to get one of the kids attention cause they were out of cream for coffee and I literally stood there for 5 minutes cause the kid was on his phone texting and never looked up. And no one else paid attention.  I finally had to say something and he said \"oh sorry\".  They need to have more mature workers that know what they are doing at this location."}
{"text":"They have good options here. 
There are plenty of healthy items on the menu and the coffee is bottomless (if you stay there). The turkey sausage sandwich is good and they have the thin bagels that I like. 
The lunch choices arn't to shabby either. I like the turkey sandwich with sprouts (don't remember the name). 
They normally have coupons in the paper or showing up in the mail, using them makes this place a very affordable choice when you are on the run. 
The service is slower than fast food, but the quality is better."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would.  I've been doing the same thing for years.  No issues.  Everything bagel add breakfast ham and cheddar.  No issue at all.  Today the \"manager\" said I have to be charged for the breakfast sandwich even though I never get the egg. It's much more expensive this way.  I go Here at least twice per week and no issue.  Hmmm.  If you change rules do tell but in such a way to not lose the customer.  I won't be back.  Sad because I am one of \" the usuals\" with my bagel and blended Carmel mocha drink.   Guess I'll find another breakfast stop.  Shame on you for your tactfulness manager lady.  And, yes, i too am a manager and would never treat one of my guests like you just did.  
The team in there are awesome.  They know what I order and handle me with professionalism.  Must have learned from a previous manager.  

Einsteins on sunset has lost this customer."}
{"text":"We love coming here for breakfast. The sandwiches are always good and made right then, no lamp warming food here. The coffee is always good and I like the flavored coffee they'll put out, which changes periodically.

The bagel bins are normally filled but if you happen to come just after a rush you might not find the bagel you want. We've tried several flavors of bagels and all are good. The schmear can be a bit heavy handed but that's an easy fix by either requesting it light or having it on the side. 

I love that you can get many of the bagels \"thintastic\" meaning a thinner bagel with fewer carbs but still get the bagel taste and feel.

Again if the restaurant has been busy it might need a floor sweep but it always gets done. 

The staff has always been friendly and that's great for our very early morning visits! If you ever experience a problem be sure to chat with Matthew who is the manager. He'll make it right.

I've also had lunch sandwiches and those too are tasty with a variety to choose from. The bagel dog however might be my all time favorite!  You hand to ask them for it, it's not on the menu and they run out quickly,!

Give Einstein's a try if you're looking for something a little different for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"My fiancé, sister and I came in here for. Real fast as we dropped her off to school. We had the herbivore on five cheese bagel (it was like a pizza but for breakfast with shmear instead of eggs, really good!), apple cinnamon bagel with honey almond cream cheese, French toast bagel wth honey almond cream cheese, and the California nova lox bagel (swapped the ginger wasabi cream cheese for veggie - almost like a sushi in bagel form...never had wasabi pickles but it gave it a good kick and overall the bagel was really good!). All were really good and had a good ratio of cream cheese to bagel. The bottomless coffee is great too! Friendly staff, clean environment, and if you sign up for their emails, you can almost always guarantee not having to pay full price for whatever you buy!"}
{"text":"This location can hardly keep the cinnamon on top of the cinnamon and sugar bagel. Also, they always seem to be extremely understaffed and have messed up my simple order a few times. 

I prefer the location off of Frank Lloyd Wright or Thomas."}
{"text":"I love Einsteins and have never had a bad experience. This location is conveniently attached to Starbucks for those of you who have no discernment for good coffee. It's kind of a less clean location and it gets really busy between 11-1. Parking lot is so tight and small, I've seen 3 accidents in the past couple of years. 

Anything other than bagel+cream cheese is rather overpriced, IMO. Including all their beverages."}
{"text":"There's always a line at this place so I was a bit skeptical.  I don't want to wait in line for bagel and cream cheese :-)  However, I had to give a try the second time I was around this place.  I had the Turkey Sausage, Egg, Spinach, Mushroom, and Cheese on a Honey Wheat Bagel.  It was very filling and the bagel is very fresh.  Their coffee is great, which I am able to mix and match by doing a dark roast and autumn roast combination."}
{"text":"One of few places open at 5am. The crew is always friendly and cheery. Greet you with a smile which I need when I am up that early. They always serve me quickly which is necessary when I am rushing to work. Of course, the bagels and shmears are yummy. Love their to go boxes which makes it easy to take my goods and run. Love this place."}
{"text":"Totally just got a long strand of hair in my frozen mocha and it took quite a bit before they made me another one and they weren't busy... On the bright side, it was delicious."}
{"text":"OK gave them the benefit of the doubt a second chance change for chance of winning today again same time look like the same people behind the counter no bagels plain bagels all they did have a some OJ asked employee if they have any more plain bagels or other bagels turn ask another person in the back came back all know we don't Not even an apology I call corporate let's see if they could change that store it's the only one on my way to work"}
{"text":"The green chili bagel was not cooked all the way through.  Some may like it on the raw side but not me."}
{"text":"This is a very nice clean place, but they take the wrong bagel for let's say a sandwich a lot otherwise I love taking my kids here for breakfast when I can."}
{"text":"Came here to order a cinnamon bagel toasted with butter, got a cinnamon bagel coated with diabetes instead"}
{"text":"Great food but I'm tired of the unfriendly staff and less then good service. I wi t be coming here anymore. I guess I'll just find somewhere else to spend my money."}
{"text":"Need a manager to clean house, employees lack training and the bagels are average at best, usually avoid this place after 5 past visits that weren't pleasant, tried Einstein's again with the buy six bagels and cream cheese coupon but get home to find 5 bagels in the bag, guess it's hard to count to 6 now! They have now lost a customer for good, will never be back ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely top notch service when they give you your egg sandwich on a bagel while you are still filling your coffee cup"}
{"text":"One would think that a place that sells so many bagels and drinks could get a working scanner at their cash register..."}
{"text":"This location is very busy. Some of the staff is nice enough but what is frustrating is they don't have an express coffee line like other Einstein's. So you wait in long lines even if not ordering food. Also as busy as this location is they should be monitoring the coffee and making sure it's always filled. In the mornings allow lots of extra time if you plan on stopping here."}
{"text":"Very friendly service, but my order is wrong 50% of the time.
The store is always clean and I never have to wait in line. The staff is very accommodating as well.
My only complaint is that when I order any but just a bagel and shmear, they get it wrong.
I've tried to order the Bagel Thin Eggwhites Southwest Turkey-Sausage a couple of times and it was no good.
The first time it was so soggy with too much salsa and cream cheese and missing the pepper jack. The second time I ordered I asked for easy on the salsa a cheese and only got the sausage and egg white with nothing else. It's kinda frustrating.
So I say come here for a quick bagel & shmear, but skip anything more complicated than that."}
{"text":"Once again, the worst service!!!  I wonder if any managers or owners actually read the reviews on these sites or on the reviews we do for the receipts.  Once again, I go in, my order was not only wrong, but I didn't get a receipt.  I always have to ask for one because they have charged me extra in the past.  Whenever I ask for a receipt I get a huge irritated sign from the staff.

Does this place care about customer service at all???  I don't think the managers care because when I call they also seem so irritated."}
{"text":"The SLOWEST Einstein staff ever! Full of excuses... Every time we come they apparently are down a toaster or multiple staff members. I just want my ONE bagel... I don't even get it toasted, and yet... 16 mins after we order... I'm still standing here waiting for the food I just paid for. uggggh"}
{"text":"They are always out of bagels that I want. Just have poppy seed or plain. I thought they specialize in bagels. Who ever is ordering supplies, is not doing a good job. Going to try another Einstein's, hopefully I'll get what I want, or at least better choices!"}
{"text":"Every other time we go here, the orders are wrong. What is so hard in making a pizza bagel? If we wanted anything else on it, we'd request it.

Then we get home, one bagel has hardly any sauce or cheese. You couldn't make the two bagel orders the same?! If this job is too hard, then go somewhere else, or learn your job and give 100%.

Also, a note to all Einstein Bagel shops, order more cheese bagels. If you run out of a type of bagel so fast, then order more of that type. Supply & demand. Business 101!"}
{"text":"People working here are under staff but real nice and polite didn't have to much at around 3pm to pick from. Place was a little dirty with tables not clean. My food was good all pre-package"}
{"text":"They have really improved the service here. Can get in and out quickly and with the correct order!  
Coffee not the best and the soda machine needs some calibrating. 
Friendly employees.  Get great coupons via email!"}
{"text":"I have been visiting this Einstein location for six months.  The service has been consistently poor.  The servers are extremely disinterested in providing even adequate service.  In addition they are more often than not out of both sesame and poppy seed bagels (this before 12 noon)  The two most popular bagels and you can't figure out how to bake enough for the demand?  Was there today and finally walked out after not even being acknowledged. (also out of sesame and poppy).  I read the other reviews and they are pretty consistent with my experiences at this location.  I guess the management does not care enough to fix these issues.  BTW the bagels at Fry's are decent enough to avoid going to Einstein."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Einstein bagels and was happy to discover this one since moving North. This morning, I ordered (2) plain bagels to go and since it was a simple order, I didn't bother looking in the bag. When I got to my friends house, I discovered (2)small  blobs of bagel dough that looked nothing like a bagel! I have a photo to show if management would be interested in seeing. I won't stop here again."}
{"text":"A single star? You bet and that's only because these folks have something at at least resembles bagels, and they're overpriced at that. Go to the Bagel Cafe, which has real ones."}
{"text":"A friend just reminded me how much I enjoy coming here for their avocado toast. The overall establishment is clean but it gets busy and dirty quickly. 

Parking his a hassle but can't really blame them for that."}
{"text":"We frequent this location! They know us by name! We love coming in and seeing all the regulars - customers and employees! 

The coffee & Food? DARN GOOD!"}
{"text":"What's not to like about bagels and coffee?

I come here at least twice a month.  I either get the everything bagel with the veggie cream cheese, or I opt for one of their breakfast sandwiches (bacon and cheddar is my favorite).  I love that you can put your sandwiches on any bagel.

Service is usually great!"}
{"text":"Extremely dirty. This is disgusting. Food all over floors, tables, and counters. Unacceptable. How hard is it to sweep and wipe tables? I'm shocked. One of the cooks is also burning some food right now and the whole place is filling with smoke.

I forgot to add: I brought up to an employee here that the dining room needed swept and tables needed cleaned. He did nothing. In fact, shortly after, he went on his break outside. Never told anyone about the mess, never cleaned it up himself. Simply put, no one that works here cares about a clean facility."}
{"text":"Einstein Bros is one of the few franchises I respect, so this review is not about the food (although my lox was a bit sparing on the cream cheese); it's about the service.

I came here quite cheery on a Saturday morning, and the one taking the orders was in such a vile mood.  I had to repeat my order to her several times because she was mumbling under her breath to repeat my order back to me, all while glaring at me as if to project whatever problems she was having. Fine.  Whatever.  However, even after finishing my meal she continued to be huffy, publicly.  I've never seen such a display before in front of so many customers.

Warning to businesses about employee morale."}
{"text":"I walked in with 2 orders in front of me. I ordered 2 blueberry with butter cut into quarters not toasted to go. The person taking my order said, \"that was easy\" 
I get my order a few minutes later, which appreciated since I was running late; however, when I finally opened the bag they got the blueberry bagel, the cut into quarters correct but it had CREAM CHEESE on it. I hate cream cheese. Needless to say I didn't get to eat my breakfast this morning."}
{"text":"It is frezzing inside and the service is terrible,gave away our order to someone else and then said it would be another 15 min and when we said no they only gave us a partial refund and made us pay for the coffee even thoug we were leaving .they need a lesson in the customer is right"}
{"text":"I've never had an issue with this Einstein Bagels location. I usually get the Chorizo Sunrise which is an awesome breakfast sandwich every time."}
{"text":"This location is always pretty busy. Fast and friendly service. I love the lox bagel! They also have a deal on Mondays for $6 bagels so you can be the hit of the office."}
{"text":"Best Einstein Bagels out there. Friendly staff, great management. I prefer this location over ANY other! Asiago bagels arw my favorite."}
{"text":"Walked in, stood at order here counter for several minutes.  The one guy that appeared to be working never acknowledged me. So I left."}
{"text":"Just bought the worse cappuccino. The coffee was burnt.. So disappointing. I had to throw away the entire large cappuccino because it was inedible."}
{"text":"Sorry guys, this place is so incredibly dirty. Kitchen prep area, a mop standing behind the cashier, the cashier itself, the restrooms and especially the coffee self serve area. They are clearly understaffed.  No sense of urgency from the manager. Cashier doesn't have enough change, yet the manager doesn't bother to support her staff. Coffee self service area is stained and the coffee signs have sticky glue all over them since they are clearly cracked.
Very sad to see to fail such a simple operation. Give your customers their bagel and coffee in a timely manner and give the place a deep clean. 
Sorry guys..."}
{"text":"I love AZ but being from NYC, there is one thing that AZ doesn't do well and that is bagels. Einstein bagels are NOT real bagels, they are basically round bread. If you are looking for an authentic bagel, this is not the place to go. 
Chompies is about three stars on my list of bagel places but NY Bagels and Bialys is probably the closest thing I have had to real bagel since I have been out West."}
{"text":"Dear Manager,

Yes, I was the person who came in with a coupon with no expiration date on it that said I could have a deli sandwich for $5.99.  You told me it was no longer valid.  I pointed out to you that you had a very large sign in your front window that said the same thing.  you doubted me, until you saw it.  Do you still doubt me, as you took it down, of course not.  I then asked again for the $5.99 special.  You refused.  Are you aware of what LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE that is?  Are you aware that by my pointing the sign out to you that I saved you from another customer doing the same thing?  Are you aware of false advertising?  Are you aware that you lost a customer instead of created a customer?  What do you suppose would happen if you comped me that sandwich and thanked me for pointing out the problem?  And exactly how much would that cost you?  Or even let me have the sandwich at $5.99 (ps. I went to Chick Filet instead)

Oh by the way, you are suppose to be the role model for your employees.  Well, you are.  They act as clueless as you.

I will be calling your corporate office.  Have a nice day and give a thought or two to what customer service means."}
{"text":"Giving one star only but that is because you can't do negative stars. Stopped by this morning for a bagel and coffee. Ordered an Asiago bagel toasted with Salmon cream cheese. The staff was overworked and rushing through the orders. When I got to my office and was ready to eat my bagel, I open it up to find that there was literally just a shmear of cream cheese on my bagel that was spread so thin, there was at least half the surface area with no cream cheese and another quarter of the area barely had a slight smudge of cream cheese. I know this isn't the end of the world but if I have to pay $5.19 for a bagel and small coffee, then I would at least like to get enough cream cheese to cover both sides of a sliced bagel. Not cool!"}
{"text":"This is an overall review of the many times (not sure why) I come here. My wife and I life about 1mi from here and like to walk there on Sunday's. She ordered a breakfast sandwich and it was OK, not worth the money. 

We keep trying to give it a chance but why? There never seems to be any management there to show employees what to do etc.

Today at 8AM, trashcan overflowing. Did you not empty the day before. Two of the four coffee's were empty. Really? Napkin dispenser empty. My wife told be the bathroom was horrible, nothing for parents to wipe their kids if needed, not enough TP and so on. 

Come on Einstein's, get it together. Ever since this placed opened here, it's been a train wreck."}
{"text":"I'm just going to have to say it. This location sucks at life. I've been going to the desert ridge and 7th and bell locAtions 2-3 x a week for literally two years. Always both packed and efficient. This location literally is so bad it's painful to watch. Painful. There is NO sense of urgency and literally my order is wrong more than right. Today I got something not even on the menu. It was half chorizo breakfast sandwich and half my southwest egg white sandwich. I won't dare order a latte, I'm diabetic and for sure they would try to murder me with using sugar and not sugar free. 

Sometimes other patrons laugh with me with how they literally can't multi task to save their life but how dead they can be and still make you wait 10 minutes for the wrong order. Sometimes I feel like there are hidden cameras somewhere and it's all a joke. 

On the other hand,
It's a very special skill set to be this bad. If it was based on that scenario it would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"I asked for my bagel to be toasted and it wasn't , didn't realize until I left . You have 1 job.........."}
{"text":"I got the bagel with lox and a schmear which I thought was pretty good. It wasn't too spectacular given that it's a restaurant chain so I had no real qualms with it. Pretty light on the capers, and there wasn't the tomato as I've seen in NY deli's. 

Granted, it's a NY deli and not a Einstein Bagel franchise so there are going to be some drastic differences. Overall, it did the job."}
{"text":"The staff at this location deserves 10 stars!  This location is in the Hyatt Regency Hotel, and has a very demanding clientele.  Totally understandable since it's a hotel.  However, the staff handled the traffic and impatient travelers like champs!  Coffee was flowing, bagels were toasting, and the line was smooth!  Great food, hot delicious coffee, and smiling faces!  Thank you for making me fast hot coffee every morning during my stay here!"}
{"text":"I love Einstein's! This location isn't my favorite but I'm biased toward loving the location I used to go to as a child. The staff at this Scottsdale location is very nice and helpful, at times I notice they get flustered (usually during the peak hours) and sometimes forgetful. But all in all they are super friendly so I guess in some cases it makes up for their rare mistakes they make. Just be sure to check your order if you come here during a rush. 

The location itself is easy to find but this parking lot is a disaster and always is, so be warned about the parking situation (park to the left of the building for a non crowded lot)  

My usual is an everything bagel toasted with plain cream cheese. Possibly double toasted if I'm in a picky mood. 

They also have awesome breakfast and lunch sandwiches and an awesome coffee selection. \"Darn good coffee!\" 

I'll be back for the delicious fresh bagels that are made daily the friendly staff and dirty chi latte! Yum!"}
{"text":"This location is gross and the staff is incompetent. The bagel egg sandwiches are tiny and every time I try and give it another shot, I'm met with more disappointment. Upper management needs to spend more time here and work out the kinks. Place seems dirty too."}
{"text":"Locations everywhere.  This location happens to have a very efficient and friendly staff.  They have made improvements in having enough staff to handles big lines in the morning.  Bagels are fresh.  Nice combination of service and food."}
{"text":"Save your time and just go to the Einsteins up the road at Gilbert and Baseline.  The staff at this one recently changed again and this location is suffering for it.  They are constantly running out of a lot of the bagel types (walk in to find a bunch of empty baskets at 8am) and the location is not as clean as the others.  The staff is unprofessional and they don't take pride in their restaurant.  I see them spend time throwing food items around and joking when the coffee needs refills or the tables need to be cleaned up.  LOVE Einsteins but sadly this location is subpar to every other one I have been to.  I stopped going here after my last visit. Only positive is that this location stays pretty slow and quiet compared to the others."}
{"text":"Always Good, Thania and her staff do a great job!"}
{"text":"Don't go there in the afternoon. Apparently they stop brewing coffee hours before I got there because half of them were out and the other half cold. The sandwich may have been cooked that morning as well. So disappointed at this location."}
{"text":"I love Einstein bagels! This location SUCKS! The employees are rude and every single visit has been terrible! They ALWAYS get my order wrong! Today I ordered -- girl at the counter was nice enough! I pay for my order at the next counter and the women is nice as always. I wait for my order and see that it's all wrong--- I bring it back to the counter to report the issue and ask nicely fix it -- I get rolled eyes from the women at the counter then I get a huffy melt down by the girl on the food prep line. WOW, unprofessional and extremely poor customer service! People around me were blown away by the \"mean girl\" performance! Customer lost --- I will never be back to this location and plan on contacting the district manager! It's the principle!!!!! I paid $10 for a bagel and bottle of water -- I expect a nice place to dine and friendly customer centered people. They could tell how upset and saddened I was by their reaction to me and NO efforts were made to make the situation right.  This is not the Einstein's way -- I'm very disappointed but it's obvious if you hire rude careless people whom service your customers this morning then you're aware of the horrific attitudes and service they provide! I will never be back and hope those reading this will chose another bagels shop! Don't reward businesses that treat their customers so poorly!"}
{"text":"This location sucks! The staff are incredibly slow and just can't be bothered. Can I just say that I LOVE Einstein's bagels -- it is my all time favorite bagel and smoothie shop !!!!! This location is a huge disappointment. I will never go back to this location. Order a bagel and schmere and what felt like a life time pass before my bagel was done -- I was the only one there and it took almost 10 mins -- the two employees were too busy chatting with one another. I finally got my bagel and it was delish but I was too annoyed with the service to enjoy it. I then decided to get a drink before leaving. I stood at the register for almost 5 mins while the two young male employees where restocking the cold bar (a matter of a few feet from me) and would look up at me but NEVER offered to help or came over to take my order. I was dumbfounded. This place really needs an intervention. Wow! I finally just said OUT LOUD \"I guess I will just not buy a drink\" and went to leave. They looked right at me and did nothing so I left. It was so weird. VERY poor service. I am sad because I LOVE Einstein's bagels. I hope this location closes so no one else has to deal with this type of experience."}
{"text":"In today's world Einstein Bros are in most of the major airports in the US. Those of you that travel on Southwest through Denver have likely seen the massive lines at that one. Meanwhile, when flying through SWA in Las Vegas I haven't seen those lines amass here, which is a good thing. In fact, in the dozen times I've either walked by this spot (or grabbed a bagel here) the lines have moved quickly and service has been adequate for an airport location. Unlike Dunkin Donuts (where locations are littered across Vegas) and many of the other airport restaurants that serve them the bagels at Einstein taste fresh like they were baked on site. If you're in search for a bagel and coffee - this is likely your best chance at something good."}
{"text":"When everyone at a restaurant knows your name that means they value your business and that is why my family and I eat at this einstein's weekly. Wendy does an amazing job with this store. Her staff is friendly and always happy to see you. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I actually live just around the corner from the Sahara/Fort Apache location but I drive all the way over here because they keep this location clean, their employees always have smiles on their faces (except the GM?) and sure the service can be slow but they are worth the wait compared to the other location closer to me. I'm not a fan of their Vanilla latte and the two times that I've ordered one they look at me stupid (obviously you're not Starbucks but why have it on the menu if you don't want to sell it?) but their regular coffee isn't terrible. Is this the best breakfast place in town? No. But is it the worst? No. I also enjoy the coupons! Every penny counts."}
{"text":"Bagels are overpriced.  I would much rather go down the street to Chompie's where the bagels are bigger, tastier, and less expensive.  Coffee refill was warm but not hot."}
{"text":"The bagels are pretty tasty, and the staff is nice. They have some really good deals if you are looking to get a dozen or so bagels and some cream cheese."}
{"text":"First off I love Einsteins bagels. Been to many locations. This one is by my new job and already been 10 times in a month. I could eat a bagel daily. Too bad this place has worst service! Literally yesterday I walked in. There was one other customer just waiting for her order. The 2 employees behind the counter were too busy making fun of her to complete her order or take mine. It's like how dare I come in while they are busy talking. Every time no smile, thank you, even nod."}
{"text":"Nice changes happy to come back for good. Great customer service today and a delicious bagel!"}
{"text":"Einstein Bagels prices are pretty reasonable. & I love the customer service at this Einstein bagels. Everyone who works there seems to enjoy their job and their interaction with the customers exemplifies this. You can walk into this Einstein in an okay mood & walk out in a great mood. Their energy is contagious. Because of the customer service at Rural & Ray Einstein some of my days have been more enjoyable! PS I love the Tasty Turkey."}
{"text":"I go here quite a bit. It's good enough, but it will not bowl you over. Honestly, the interior is weathered, I don't find the place super clean. It's smaller and they look crammed in back. The only reason I go is 2 bagels. The pretzel bagel and the asiago cheese bagel. Sometimes when I'm having a super carb craving, I have to have a bagel. 
The coffee is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Friendly Staff, Always Quick. Im in and out in under 5 minutes in the morning."}
{"text":"At least my 10th time to this location, and quite the unusually interesting experience. First, I stand in line, patiently awaiting my turn to order. Fortunately I have the free entertainment of watching the eggs being placed onto the cook plate. The gentleman doing so was very methodical, first cleaning the cook top, then buttering, then measuring the egg whites, and then cracking eggs open one-handed. Yes, one-handed. Talented, I've yet to personally master that. Then joy! It's my turn! I step up to the \"plate\" aka ordering computer. Who do I see? The same gentleman who was just showcasing his egg talents. I tell him that I have a 6 bagel and tub of shmear deal. He nicely asks me which bagels I'd like, and grabs each of them with his hands. You think, what's so strange or wrong with that? Well, he still had his egg gloves on- and I watched his thumbs break into the eggs... health code violation?   Then I get down to the selection of my last two bagels. \"I'll take the power protein please\". The gentleman tells me that will be \"a few cents extra\". I politely ask, \"how much is a few cents?\" He responds, \"about 50 cents\". I then reply, \"well I don't consider that a FEW cents, with two power proteins that's at least a dollar difference, that changes everything.\" Here comes another strange thing, I suddenly here an echo, \"that changes everything\". But the echo is not in my voice. Doubly strange I would say. Oh! That's right! Now my memory serves me- it was another gentleman working behind the counter who mocked me. 
Thank you Einstein Bros, a pleasant Sunday morning to you too."}
{"text":"This is the worst Einstein ever. I go to my normal local Einstein and in comparison this place is like going to a 7 eleven. Never have coffee brewed and the employees ignore you when you come in."}
{"text":"Worst customer service in history! After watching the employee try and prepare a salad that was taking over 15 minutes and seeing him handle money then keep trying to prepare my salad I was disgusted. When I proceeded to tell them I wanted a refund and they refused and they said they didn't like me as a customer. Who says that??? Because I didn't want to eat the salad that took over 15 minutes to prepare and who was handling my food with dirty hands. Absolutely worst place ever! Do not recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow. Inconsistent. Only going to come when there is no line. Otherwise 20 minute wait is not with the mediocre breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"Short-staffed, sat in the drive through for 15 minutes and they didn't even get the order right.  Nasty lady was not nice to us. When we pulled up, she said, \"hold on,\" and started having a conversation with her friend in the building that took 5 minutes! Terrible customer service.  Food wasn't bad though.  I don't recommend it and I know I will never go back there!"}
{"text":"There's bagels and coffee.  What's not to like? Well, no complaints here.  I love bagels and coffee.  I can put up with the way too loud loop of coffee house douche bag music they insist on subjecting their customers to.  I can deal with all the street zombies shuffling in for their free water and bathroom.  I will put up with a lot for a good bagel, and they have good bagels!"}
{"text":"It's an Einstein's so i think you know what to expect.  For this location they make good coffee drinks, but they seem a little disorganized depending on who you get at the first cash register."}
{"text":"One word for this location - slow!  If it's a morning weekend rush, there needs to be a little urgency when you're making bagels.  If the line is 10+ people deep, let's get some of the additional help from the back.  It's a clean and big location, but the service is extremely slow.  You know what to expect from einsteins and the bagels are fresh as always.  Make sure you have a little more time when you stop here."}
{"text":"The food was OK, it was the customer service that was bad.  Cashier was wearing a hoodie... with the hood on!!!??? In July. In Phoenix. At work.
I said Good Morning and she just stared at me blankly.  Then when I paid,  I said Thank you to the other worker and she just looked at me and then turned around and walked away.  Wth??? I'll stick to somewhere else where they at least say Hi to you before you hand over your money."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and always treat Hospital staff and First Responders amazing. Its a one stop shop for me. I get my Bagels here and they share the building with Starbucks and thats where i get my coffee."}
{"text":"Good food but grossly understaffed. I ordered some coffee and OJ for a group and was told it would take 20 minutes for them to \"get to it\". I asked if they needed to make a fresh batch and the woman replied no but it would take 20 minutes before they could pour it in the back. I have a hard time believing there is anything more profitable for the store that a $16 to-go batch of coffee!"}
{"text":"Came here twice now, both times with different staff working. On both occasions my order was wrong. 1st time, chocolate chip bagel with strawberry (came out with plain). 2nd time with blueberry (came out with honey). For such simple orders I'm not sure how one can mess them up. 2 stars for the bagel tasting pretty good once it was made correctly"}
{"text":"Store #4051 has much to learn. I moved nearby and have been taking my business there for over a year. Believe it or not, in 1 year my order has not once (NEVER) been correct.  I truly believe the owner and manager could care less. The manager attempts to make an effort when the GM visits. After today, my order incorrect yet again, I will NEVER spend my money there ever again.  The worst customer service."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in this company no matter the location the customer service is lacking. So i order my bagel and cream cheese i go to pay the guy says pay at the other register i go to the register wait a few mins no one comes down to take my payment then one of the guys making my food gives me my bag i say i still need to pay he looks at me blank faced and goes back to making orders. I stand there another min no one comes up to take my payment then i get another guys attention and state i need to still pay he yells to someone in the back room and finally someone takes my payment. I usually do drive thru so i figured that may have been why the customer service was bad because it was more transactional but it dosent matter ita bad either eay."}
{"text":"Very good bagels.  Tasty too. Everyone provides great customer service.  I have eaten or picked up for a supply of bagels at home. Always good"}
{"text":"The lox and bagel on an everything bagel was perfect. It hit the spot! Service was superb too - Julia behind the counter had impeccable customer service skills. Fresh coffee and the patio was great at 0730 in the morning.  Coming back soon!"}
{"text":"So we asked for butter to go on our very dry breakfast sandwiches- and they wanted to charge us!! I know .60 is a drop in the hat but really? And this is after I had to go up because they ignored my son. Next time I'll go to Panera Bread."}
{"text":"BOOOOOMB. love bagels. For sure best bagels ever. I love all the different types of cream cheese and the service is always really fast! Also super cheap!"}
{"text":"This place is such a joke!!!!! The girl with the blue hair and last nights makeup is super rude and put out by the fact that I asked to also purchase a coffee with my order after I paid. She gave me a dirty look and rolled her eyes. Then when my food was ready ( an everything bagel with egg and cheese and a cinnamon sugar bagel with honey almond cream cheese)  was ready she slammed it on the counter and walked off. My mom and I got all the way home to open the cinnamon sugar bagel and find a burnt roll with cream cheese on it. We drove all the way back and the guy making the bagels argued with me and told me it was a bagel. I told him bagels have holes in the middle and he said it doesn't matter it's a bagel that's how I made them. After arguing with me again that he toasted it and it was burnt he finally decided to make me a new \"roll\". After he was finished he threw it across the counter and walked off. I'm not sure who the manager is here but between him and the blue haired girl that's so rude I can't even believe this place stays in business. If any manager or district manager is reading this can you please respond to this review."}
{"text":"This location is terrible. I was in this morning and the floor behind the counter was disgusting. It was littered with trash and bagels. So much trash that you could barely see the floor. It made me reconsider eating there but I still ordered a few bagels. I got home with my order and we were missing a bagel even though we were charged for it. The woman taking our order didn't seem to listen to anything I was saying. I had to repeat my request for an extra cream cheese 3 times. I don't expect much from Einstein's but it would be nice to actually get what I paid for and to keep their restaurant clean."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Einsteins. As a life long bagel lover living in Vegas, we haven't many choices to pick from when wanting an authentic bagel. Einstein's never disappoints! Recently I've been getting the farmhouse bagel sandwich. It's a bagel topped with hashbrowns and stuffed with your basic egg, bacon, and cream cheese. The combo is awesome and the bagel is like nothing ive had before. Such a great combination!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this bagel and coffee shop. They serve wonderful food and have great coffee. They also are pet friendly as they have dog bowls with water outside."}
{"text":"I just came in for an OJ and one of their fruit cups, I was in a deep craving of fruits and this was the closest spot to me that Thursday that offered such small craving to-go. The service was okay/good. Could have been better."}
{"text":"I always order my food before I pick it up. The times I don't I watch them make the food fresh. Taste great, have healthy options, and the employees are good people. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I see a common trend with the reviews for this location. It is all too unfortunate that this is the case. The staff here is always soft spoken and the fumble around with orders. There is hardly ever a genuine greeting or acknowledgement when you enter the place. Everyone seems annoyed or not really wanting to be there. The food is hit or miss. A lot of the time they don't have certain items and when you order hey don't tell you until you're about to pay. They take way to long to actually make your food when you do have a successful time ordering that your break is already done by the time you get your food. I don't really see a manager here that often or one that I could tell is a manager. Everyone just seems miserable and that makes the guests feel the same. I don't think I'll be going back here ever again. I have given it too many chances to be even remotely engaging or positive and all the times it's been disappointing."}
{"text":"Excellent place! The best coffee I could ever get , bagel with lax is delicious! Clean, tasty, cozy.  I mean this place is really underrated for the reason I do not understand. Much better than Starbucks, in many ways.  So, 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is the best Einsteins I've been to!! It's clean, the staff are friendly, and it has a GREAT outdoor seating area. Paul, the owner, is friendly and goes out of his way to make sure we're happy. He remembers us when we come in - it's a big company run with a small, family business feel. I've made this my breakfast spot because I know that I'll be treated well!!"}
{"text":"Fun fun as a bagel place.  Affordable
Best bagels ever with all types of toppings.
You can find fresh juice, all types of cream cheese - whipped and classic.  Decent coffee.
If your craving for a bagel go there!"}
{"text":"2 stars are being awfully generous. We just went in at 12:30 and they were sold out of basically everything already. We order 4 bagels not even toasted, they miss one bagel altogether and when we went back to order it it was gone since it was the last one. There were about 5 or 6 employees but only one person on the register. We waited for almost 10 minutes for untoasted bagels, there was one person in front of us who ordered one thing. The lady tried giving us a lame excuse of they have new workers who don't know how to bag the bagels.......excuse me? They are working at a bagel shop. Face slap. This world is doomed if us humans can't even handle placing bagels in a bag. We also get home to find they didn't slice the bagels. So we waited over 10 minutes for only 3 plain unsliced bagels."}
{"text":"Not sure why they only have 2.5 stars but my experience here was really good. It didn't start that way but it finished strong. I came here about 3 weeks ago and ordered my usual sandwich but to my surprise the out pork sausage instead of the turkey sausage I ordered. For most people this wouldn't be a issue but I haven't eaten pork since 1999and it completely ruined my sandwich / breakfast that day. Fast forward 3 week and I happen to be in the area and figured I would talk to management about it and they quickly apologized and did everything in their power to make sure I was happy including offer a refund which I appreciated but didn't take. So end the end I Got great service and they made me an amazing sandwich that was just as I ordered today. It's not how you start it's how you finish that I remember and I will gladly do business with this location in the future."}
{"text":"This is the worst customer service I have ever had to deal with. The staff has zero communication therefor multiple orders were wrong, and took over 20 minutes to get out. I personally witnessed employees despite wearing gloves touching their hair, and dropped milk caps on the floor and continued to put it on the milk jug. If I was a health inspector they definitely would not have passed. It just seems to have gotten sloppy and disappointing.

Not to mention I've been sitting typing this review, I open my bagel and the cream cheese and butter I paid for aren't on here.... Who eats bagels just toasted?"}
{"text":"This place totally deserves 5 stars for their food and service. 1 star down for being a chain and cleanliness.

Situated at a corner in a strip mall next to the university, this place has a great manager and best service. They are very fast with the food and drink orders. Will definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast/brunch spot. Fresh bagels and different types of cream cheese.

They even have Bagel Thins for those who are cutting their carbs. 

You don't pay the person who took you order, but move down the line to pay for your food.

Their iced coffee are a great deal!! It's a 20oz cup for less than $3!"}
{"text":"I love FRESH bagels and Einstein has a great selection! This is my go-to place if I'm in a rush and just need a bagel and coffee to-GO. They also have bagel sandwiches and even pre-packed salads. 

My favorite is their Honey Wheat Thin bagel and the Cranberry Bagel. 

Service is fast. You place your order at the first counter and pay at the second counter."}
{"text":"We are frequent customers of your store. Usually there are no problems. Until a higher priced order is made. My husband visited to pick up a toasted onion bagel with cream cheese. I only order this bagel every three months or so due to the exuberant overcharging as a salmon and caper sandwich and not just a bagel with cream cheese and lox. That said, this is yet another time (of a bout three times now - I know shame on me for expecting them to fulfill this correctly for once) this store has botched it up. I have to bring this to someone's attention.

For the third time in a row, they took my husbands order of 1 - toasted onion bagel with plain cream cheese and add lox. He also ordered a drink. So $12 for a bagel with cream cheese and lox and a drink. However when he got home and we opened the bag and opened the box there sat a plain, un-toasted bagel with very little cream cheese and lox. Huzzah for the lox at least. Since that is what drives the price to a ludicrous amount. But the bagel was totally wrong. The cream cheese looked like it was the very last bit on earth, smeared so thin, it barely covered the plain white bread cold rubbery bagel. Not toasted. Not an onion bagel. So disappointed.   

I am not sure if this is intentional to save money and totally gyp frequent paying customers when they order a high priced item once in a while. Or if the staff is inadequately trained to listen to a customers order and fulfill it correctly. Both are resulting of the loss of a very long standing customer. I hope they fix this so others will not have to deal with the same disappointment."}
{"text":"Salmon and crean cheese capers tomato and onion bagel. I feel compkete. Love Einstein's."}
{"text":"I will admit that I'm a little biased when it comes to my bagels because I'm from Northern NJ and New York City, but I have to admit that these are pretty darn good. Not exactly the quality of New York, but it's there and better than anything you can find in the area. 

 Service is excellent even when packed."}
{"text":"I love Einstein bagels but sadly this location went downhill. Since adding the coffee they no longer accept Einstein coupons or offers and tell you to go to the baseline location which isn't exactly close. 

They are always out of onion! And run out of other kinds on a regular. Last time I went 4 of the 6 I wanted were out. If you know you go through onion fast, make more! 

I tried their iced Carmel coffee and it was almost undrinkable because of how sweet it was! I took it back and asked if they could remake it with 1/2 the syrup and it was better."}
{"text":"This place is continually understaffed. If you plan on picking up bagels on the way to work, is at least a 20 minute wait. On the weekend the wait is about the same.  The location on Camelback and 20th st is much faster."}
{"text":"Hooray for this place finally getting it's S*** together!

My husband and I have come here for some two years. We always stop buy before we hike the nearby Camelback Mountain. And each time, they screw something up. Usually, there's a huge line and, even though we ask for our bagels DOUBLE toasted, they fail to toast them AT ALL. Seriously. Every. Freaking.Time.

Last weekend, we can here. There was no line. And, lo and behold, they toasted our bagels perfectly. They put the right cream cheese on. And the bathrooms didn't smell. Awesome.
Keep it up, Einstein's."}
{"text":"Ghetto place. 
Staff sucks and new person on the register has no idea what she is doing or what a Lox is. 
How do you put a person in the register that should know the sandwiches 
The rest of the staff had a visitor and decided to only leave the new person upfront. 
Very dirty place, all tables where nasty."}
{"text":"the worst experience ever !! ; I went here before work with my son. first of all the lines are extremely long and the employees are extremely slow ! I ordered my coffee and a bagel, waited 20 minutes for them to give me my bagel; which was sitting next to the cashier the whole entire time !! and they didn't say anything. I was overly heated and almost late for work and dropping my kid off for school . not acceptable !! never going back to this one - NEVER !!"}
{"text":"I love this place and my favorite is the spinish artichoke chicken bagel.. its to die for along with the strawberry lemonade.."}
{"text":"Einstein's bagels are good but nothing special either if you had a true NYC bagel.   They are one step above something you get at the grocery.   They need more of a crust on the bagel.   Otherwise the jalapeño with veggie cream cheese is my favorite."}
{"text":"This Einsteins is always kicking. They do a good job of getting through the lines that happen prior to 10. The manager is very present and interacts with the customers frequently. They offer free wifi and don't mind if you hang out for awhile. The only opportunity would be cleaning. It is not always kept up after the morning rush."}
{"text":"New Einsteins. Friendly staff. Super efficient. Free wi fi.
Great location with plenty of parking."}
{"text":"It's a hit or miss when it comes to service . But they have awesome bagels you need to come in early for the best selection"}
{"text":"Great service.  Good bagels and sandwiches.  Downside, they took out their soup offerings."}
{"text":"Went in there twice now and both times this shirt dude with black hair was completely rude to me. Was hoping to get a different guy this time to take my order but nope. Same guy. Fuck that place I rather travel a longer distance than feel like shit about myself because the employees are complete dicks. Never making that mistake again."}
{"text":"I love Einstein's bagels...I usually  buy their bagels at Target. This was my first time going in their store and ordered their breakfast bagels. I was not at all impressed  with their customer  service. It was really busy. 1) There were a bunch of teens that don't smile or greet 2) They definitely need a better system of handing out their orders...was a cluster F$&#. Keep in mind its busy with alot of noise and they just say your name...its not written on the bag or anything and they just set it on the counter  and continue  on. I heard them call KIM and there was a KEN and a TIM waiting  also. A man picked up my order, left out the door to his car, and then came back and just set it back on the counter and looked through (opened the sandwiches)  another bag that was on the counter  to see if it was his. I explained  to the teen that someone  else had left with my order and came back and he opened everything up and said, \"this is your's\". I felt like they should  have made me another order but had to be somewhere  and couldn't  wait considering there were about 5 to 6 people  waiting  for their orders also. I will try another location  next time."}
{"text":"Pretty good bagels. Only issue is the layout of the store. You line up on the left to order but you then have to wait to pay on the right. But by then my food was ready back on the left and I still hadn't paid yet so the guy kept calling my name. It's not a large store so people are walking back through the line up where you place the order to pick up the food and then through them again to pay for the food. Lots of confusion. Why can't they figure out a better flow?

The food was quite good once you figure all of this out. Lots of fresh options for drinks as well. I can see why they are springing up all over the west. Come on up to Toronto Canada!"}
{"text":"Is this place now under new ownership/management?!?!...WTF?! I have been going to this place for 15+ years, and now the service is HORRIBLE! 1. Half the number of staff. 2. No one taking orders for 10 minutes. 3. Flies everywhere inside. 4. At least 20 minutes longer than normal to get a simple bagel with schmear.  5. One-third the normal amount of schmear.  Time to find a new bagel & coffee shop."}
{"text":"I love this place, but I will go out and say I'm giving such a bad review is literally every single time we visit we order something with no cheese and it comes with cheese on it. 
Not once nor twice about 19 times. It's only a inconvenience when you have to leave....so hopefully someone will see this and just make sure they double check. Staff is awesome! Place is clean great atmosphere they just love their cheese!!! :D"}
{"text":"After being dissapointed twice I have to sadly write this review. The winter blend coffe was watered down and lacked any flavor this past winter when I went it. It was previously my favorite all time coffee and I look forward to the day it comes out. This past weekend, the cinnamon sugar bagel was so dark it was nearly impossible to chew and had almost no cinnamon or sugar. The quality control just doesn't seem to be happening at this location."}
{"text":"The bagels are good but service is not. I went in at noon to get a dozen bagels to eat at home. I wanted onion, garlic, and Asiago. They were out of all of these. I asked if they would make more and they refused. We headed out and one employee told me I should come in the morning. This is a bagel shop and they are open until 5 so shouldn't you have a good variety of bagels available for at least most of your business hours? I went to the desert ridge location and they were also out but happily made more for me."}
{"text":"The staff was pretty friendly, the place was well kept. I spent 15.51 on 2 breakfast bagels, two bagels and the cream cheese which I think Is not and at all. Definitely love bagels and this is the right place for a quick bagel nothing special but it gets the job done!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and fast service.  The bagels are always delicious and fresh!  The restaurant is clean.  Love the breakfast bagels!"}
{"text":"I feel like Einstein Bros. Bagels is a GREAT choice if there aren't a lot of good breakfast places around, but if you're in an area like Phoenix/Scottsdale where there is so much great stuff to choose from, it really feels a step below.  

I've had their bagels and a few of their bagel sandwiches, and I'm never incredibly disappointed, but I'm never incredibly impressed either.  All the food is just fine.

That being said, the staff is very nice, the patio is nice ... to sum it up, it's all ... nice ... there are just a lot of places nearby that are a lot nicer."}
{"text":"The employees here are extremely rude. They act like they don't want to help or want to be at work. They all speak to customers with an attitude. I will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Quick service & friendly staff!
Right between work and home, so I go here if I have time in the mornings to grab a quick breakfast!

I always get their Bagel Thins but I've discovered a new found love for their Power Protein Bar & Spinach Florentine! Sooo good!

3 stars for average, lol. Not bad but not mind blowing either!"}

I actually like their specialty \"gourmet\" items better than bagels, like Apple Cinnamon, Power Protein, etc. with honey almond smear."}
{"text":"I like Einsteins bagels but have found their service to be inconsistent. This location is no different. I walked in and the cashier was looking down. Texting or asleep I couldn't tell. Never did acknowledge me until I said excuse me. To which she said 'yes?' I ordered and had  to repeat things several times. Order was made to go when I had asked to eat in. There was a guy sweepung up who was friendly but I think he's the only with it person in the place. On the whole an irritating experience."}
{"text":"Timing is everything ...Excellent service by a nice employee and super quick! Had my order ready by the time I paidSoft fresh bagels mmmmm"}
{"text":"ok, im on my b day week vaca from cali, n what 2 restaurants do i find on my yelp? by golly, dickie's, n einstein's. i travel often, and the other bagel locations have done justice. well, except for this one. i'm ordering over the phone, for 1, and the person i sent was a first x'er. i put emphasis on capers, not toasted, and please, lemon slices on the side. well, i guess at the time, lil miss whomever was making my (nova lox), felt the need to be sarcastic as if she had it together. my turn
   first off whoever works the shift in which it will take me 5 min to complete this paragraph, needs to learn to listen, and you may be more affective at your duty. ya forgot the lemon slices, ya could a just sent a whole one, line would a even worked. on top of that, you hid the 3 capers under the tomato. my, n u were being quite funny and rushy. even had the person i sent chuckling... until back in my presence only to enjoy their bagel, while i have a 45 min wait for a friggn lime slice that will cost $1.50. 
  next x, quit trying to be a no it all n make my damned bagel right ! too simple, now caper that! Thanks for the 'Neva-lox'. Least they got the BAGEL RIGHT."}
{"text":"I came in here on Thursday morning at 930am on 12/7.   What a delightful crew especially the guy with the beard at the register. He had a smile the whole time. They all got my order quickly and were just happy.  It's good to see that!!!"}
{"text":"Two stars because the coffee is great but the place is super dirty. We also walked in 45 min to close looking for something to eat but they refused to make anything because they were almost closing. Really?"}
{"text":"I can totally see why everyone is complaining about this place. My bagel and cream cheese came out fast and tasty. 

BUT they were out of EVERY SINGLE COFFEE (besides decaf- and that doesn't count). I let one of the girls behind the counter know and she was like, \"Yeah- they're making it.\" Five minutes later another woman inquired about the coffee, and ONLY then did the guy behind the counter go check to see for himself. So we had to sit there and stare while the guy brewed more coffee. We waited about 15 minutes after I got my bagel (to-go) in order to get coffee. 

Seriously, get your act together."}
{"text":"Horrid experience this morning, and the \"Manager\" Brittany who told me to get out of her store and not come back was completely uncalled for! We where waiting in line to order and the woman in front of us was having an issue with the price she was being charged. $7 and change for a menu item advertised at $5.19, Brittany was called away from taking our order to deal with and started to argue with this customer, first the price difference was Tax, then when the woman asked how is there $2 tax on. $5 item, she said oh well we have new boards but it's not my job to put them up so I have to charge what the register says. At this point my partner and I spoke up saying she was incorrect she had to charge what the advertised price was. Brittany at that point got all indignant and argued with us that we where wrong. She obviously does not know the Law and could het her store owner in a truck load of trouble. I will be calling on Tuesday to speak with the store manager Kelly about this issue!"}
{"text":"Went in this morning expecting just a regular visit to einstien's but I was surprised at how amazing this one was, everyone working was very friendly. They quickly got my order in and to my surprise they had way more of a coffee selection than any other Einstein's I've ever been to. On top of that they had all their milks full along with the sugar and other things to compliment the coffee. Around the time I finished making my coffee the sandwich I ordered was ready. They knocked It out of the park. Friendly service, great food, and even better coffee. Defiantly the best Einstien's in AZ. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I just left this location and was very disappointed with the quality of service and lack of communication among the staff. Also, I don't appreciate the feeling of being treated differently as the customer next to me used the same coupon I had and received her discount while I was denied. The expiration date is May 31st 2017 and it even had a barcode to scan for their convenience. There was no reason at all for such disrespect form the \"manager\" up front whatever her name is. My family Won't be going back here again and I advise you don't either."}
{"text":"I'm not a coffee drinker so I can't vouch for that. Einstein has decent bagels. Not like genuine New York bagels, but still good. They have a good, cheap menu, and service is fast. At this particular Einstein, the cashier is very friendly, which makes the day start right!"}
{"text":"gross they have roaches  gross and the manger wanted nothing to do with it some guy walton.  gross"}
{"text":"Great staff and even better food! This is the breakfast spot! Karlee is awesome and makes you feel welcomed! Best coffee in town"}
{"text":"Finally....my last few visits I have received exactly what I wanted and service has been good. I go to a few of the Einstein's in Phoenix, one in particular I refuse to step foot in again, but this location has been fairly consistent since I have been coming here.  If I don't end up getting what I order, they gladly fix. Mind you, I'm not high maintenance, I just don't like my bagel toasted.  I think that most people do get it toasted so the employees on the line are just in the habit of doing it and not paying attention to the order screen.

Bagel selection is always pretty good in the morning, a few items sold out here and there but they are baking all the time.  Iced coffee is good too. I'll be back, for sure."}
{"text":"I was running errands today and decided I was in the mood for a lox bagel with all the trimmings.  I stopped by this location and  snagged one to go, along with an iced coffee.

The service was prompt and courteous,   I was impressed tby the ability to pour a cold coffee that didn't instantly melt my ice cubes!  The lady behind the counter even gave me a choice of to-go cups, which was a nice take on service.

My bagel was nicely constructed.  Care was taken to layer the cream cheese, capers, and tomatoes.  The lox was really plentiful, and of high quality.  

Previous reviewers have given this location low marks for service and cleanliness but I had no issues with either.

The location itself is challenged by the ongoing lightrail construction.  The store is dark-ish but ambience is not a key factor in a place that is designed for takeout or quick to-go orders.



Ultimately, this places delivers good food at reasonable prices.  Give them some love, especially during this construction period!"}
{"text":"Super delicious, super fresh! I got a blueberry bagel with strawberry cream cheese, and my son got a four cheese bagel with regular cream cheese. We were both very pleased with our choices and look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"What ever happened to the Great Bagel place?  I love Bagels!!!  I had to go again to this place, and was hoping that something changed.

Sad to say it has not.  Dirty, not organized, bad & slow service.  Manager running around not paying attention to the store.

COME ON PEOPLE - this is not rocket science.

Please, please find a manager that can lead and train staff! oh and clean.

I will not return!

Please yelpians, suggest a good bagel place for me."}
{"text":"I do not know why I go to this one other than its on my way to work.  Always slow service,  not helpfull and the place is dirty! Today the register was broken so they made you stand in line for the front register then fight back up the line to select my bagels. . Come on people! If you need a manager I'll do it but who ever is doing it now has no skills. 7 people walked out while I was in line.... yikes.. I would have a heart attack if I was the manager... but no acknowledging anyone... bad!"}
{"text":"The food Is good here ! However I am not a big fan of their drinks here, Dutch bros or Starbucks is better. Another negative about this place is that they close at 3, which in my opinion is stupid! I have seen at least 3 people come to this place after three and it's been closed."}
{"text":"I love Einsteins.. but this location is a serious foul ball!  I agree with many of these comments.  Three is a really low rating for me.  The food is still pretty good, but they're skimpy with the shemere, VERY VERY slow.. and the older guy in charge.. not so much.  I've seen him be rude to staff and customers a few times.  I'm a big customer service person.  Treat people well.. and you'll do well!!!  My ONLY reason for continuing here.. is I live close enought to walk my dogs and son to hang out.. and the neighbors all hang to say hi."}
{"text":"I love this joint and am not sure why nobody else has reviewed it yet.  When I lived in town, I would walk here every morning to get a bagel and some coffee.  That is before I quit drinking coffee and eating bagels every morning.  The hazelnut is the bomb with just a touch of cream.

The bagels are great and there is a good selection of them.  Most mornings they are still hot from being cooked- no need to toast if you are getting butter or cream cheese- it will melt right in and it is delicious.  My favorite is the asiago bagel with some butter.  Yumm.  My wife is partial to the sesame with cream cheese which is also a winner.  They have breakfast sandwiches as well which are great.

At least once a quarter I would call ahead and order bagels and coffee for the office.  I would get there and everything would be ready.  They would help me load my car and off I went.  Always a big hit with my employees.  

Lunch is great here too.  They have ham sandwich that is really tasty.  The turkey is good too.  I think that you get  bag of chips or something with lunch but I can't remember- it's been a little while since I had lunch there.

The best thing about this place is the owner.  After we moved I didn't go back to Einstein's for about a year.  As soon as I walked in, she picked up exactly where we left off.  When I bring my son in, she always has something to give him.  Service with a smile is an understatement with her.  

Stop in and check it out- you'll be happy that you did."}
{"text":"I go to Einstein Bros Bagels for lunch almost every other week when I have a craving for something that's not greasy and fills me up really well.  What impresses me is the large menu of yummy bagel sandwiches, not only of the breakfast kind but also of the lunch kind.

My favorites:
1.  Tuna salad sandwich - tangy and 
2.  Pastrami Melt - the melty cheese and salty pastrami hits the spot on those extra hungry days
3.  Spinach and mushroom pizza bagel - the melty cheese, 'shrooms and spinach combination is suprisingly filling and yummy

Conclusion:  A great lunch time place to eat and hang out.  Bonus of being able to do half sandwich and soup/chip combo makes a well rounded lunch!"}
{"text":"We visited this location during a staycation at Palms Place. We knew we were coming here for breakfast when I spotted it from the parking lot- Jason loves the egg white/turkey sausage bagel-wiches at Einsteins. 

A normal Einsteins would normally get a 3-star rating if their bagels were fresh (which they always are), but this one gets an extra star for the spectacular service. The cashier, who to most people would appear to be a little rough around the edges, was really nice and knowledgable. He was able to recommend a specific item to me while I was deciding on coffee (hazelnut vanilla iced coffee). He was very knowledgable about menu items, and I was really happy with his suggestion. 

If I'm ever in the area, I'd definitely be back to this location. 

Jason gets the egg white, turkey sausage and cheese sandwich on the 4 cheese bagel.
I get original cream cheese on the asiago cheese bagel."}
{"text":"We walked in at 11 and there were no bagels left. The staff was disorganized. We had ordered and paid for our food but was then informed they were out of something. The tables were dirty and there were paper and food crumbs throughout the floor. I love Einstein Bros bagels and had great experiences at other shops except this one. I hope management is able to improve the location and really show off what Einstein bagel is all about!"}
{"text":"I stop in about three times a week to this location and I am always satisfied with the speed, price, cleanliness, and friendliness of the staff. I know with a certainty that I can get in and out with my order in under 5 minutes, which other restaurants do not share the consistency. 

I am mildly obsessed with the bagel sandwiches...(insert Homer Simpson thinking about donuts) I prefer the ham, egg, and sharp cheddar on a cheddar jalapeno bagel. I know, I know, I really need to stop being so health conscious. HA!"}
{"text":"I don't have bagels very often but decided to meet my brother today for coffee and a nosh.

We arrived at 11:30, both of us were starved.  He ordered a toasted plain with a schmear. (He's a food purist!) I grabbed a lox on pumpernickel with capers and an onion schmear, along with their house coffee.

Our meal was delicious.  Einstein's is good for a quickly prepared snack.  It's not fancy but is well located and there are lots of great selections.  I like their coffee a lot more than many other retailers as well, so try to have some whenever I go.  I just wish they carried more sugar-free syrups.

I have had their bagel dogs in the past and enjoyed them.  And, of course, the fall season brings pumpkin bagels and the transcendental pumpkin cream cheese.  I try to have at least one or two of those during that time!

I recommend Einstein's for it's service and variety!"}
{"text":"You are a bagel place - how do you not have plain shmear? Whoever is ordering inventory needs to get retrained."}
{"text":"I really like the bagels there but only if your there for breakfast. This is the one thing I cannot stand about this place. You are open for lunch but only have 2 maybe 3 bagels available because everything else is out. Why bother? I would like to see a mom and pop shop open up that we can support since the corporate places don't seem to care if they get three business in the afternoon it not."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and there was 1 person I front of me. Quick service. Easy in and out. Tastes just like the rest of the Einstein's. Delicious! Can never go wrong with a tasty turkey on a toasted sesame bagel with a pickle and side of  potato salad."}
{"text":"Einstein's is ok.  The food is kinda bland... Not much you can do with an unseasoned, microwaved egg thrown on a bagel served scalding hot. Their coffee and bagels are excellent.  Don't get hooked on a specific bagel for too long or it tends to disappear (Onion and Pretzel).  

I always go to this location on the weekends--It's always busy.  When it gets busy, the staff responses tend to be terse and they seem grouchy."}
{"text":"Great place to run in and get a light breakfast or lunch ... the staff is friendly, the store is super clean.  Go off peak hours so you have a place to sit.  I love their green tea.

Bagel thins - fabulous!  cuts out half the calories but you still get the yummy bagel taste."}
{"text":"Wow. This used to be a family favorite. Came here at 9:30 and hardly any bagels to pick from.  No plain, no honey whole wheat, no asiago cheese .... Do you want chocolate chip or garlic???  Pretty much anything else you might want to go to your local grocery store. So disappointing. Won't make a special trip here anytime
Soon"}
{"text":"Love grabbing a quick bagel before the gym... or two. I'm very plain, I love the plain bagel with plain cream cheese. It's kind of a sad addiction. The toasted bagel melts the cream cheese & they put so much in it, it's sooo freaking good. They also have very good medium roast coffee."}
{"text":"I don't look for much when getting a bagel but the staff was *constantly* shouting out things and bursting into loud songs, interrupting any conversation I was trying to have with my father.  Any other Einstein's is better than this one.  As employees you're there to serve the customers not make it impossible to hold a conversation and entertain the other staff. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Meh. Decent service, decent food. Every time we go in they seem to mess something up regarding our order. Only this location for some reason.

Keep going back for the bagel and lox. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Damn I love breakfast sandwiches and the new maple ham egg and cheese that I linked up with last time I went in there was fairly impressive. The house brand orange juice isn't fresh squeezed like it says on the cup. The cashier informed me. Tasty none the less."}
{"text":"I had a hankerin for a bagel and this location is on my way home from my early morning drive to mesa and back, so I stopped one morning and kept returning. After an unfortunate incident last month though, I won't be coming back to this location.

My first couple experiences were fine. Not amazing but I got my order quick enough (sometimes correct, sometimes not) and the location was easy to get in and out. My last visit was just bizarre.

I placed my order with the cashier since there were only a couple customers in line and no one was working the order station on the opposite end. One of the employees was fiddling with the screen that shows the orders because it wasn't working correctly. I paid for my sandwich and waited...and waited...and waited...Another patron and I made small talk while watching the one sandwich maker fiddle with the screen some more. The assistant manager was cleaning the coffee equipment. Another employee came out to work the order station and gather bagels for customers who ordered boxes. One guy came from the back to fill the ice machine. Another employee proceeded to eat his food while clocking out for break. The cashier continued to stand around. The other patron and I continued to make small talk.

Silly me to think that the girl messing with the equipment will realize that people are waiting for food...I should have spoke up sooner. 13 minutes go by until I say something. \"Sorry, we're having issues with the order screen\". No shit - how about you start hand writing orders or communicating with the person taking them? Thank you for exhibiting zero problem solving skills.

Oh, and the assistant manager? Still cleaning the coffee equipment. No leadership whatsoever.

I can put up with incorrect orders, or waiting when it's busy, but I can't put up with lackluster customer service. I'll go out of my way to the 16th st and Camelback location when I have another bagel craving."}
{"text":"What an awesome location!! The staff is super friendly, listens to exactly what you want, and takes care of your order fast. By the time I was finished paying, my order was complete, accurate (big plus!), and I was walking out the door. This isn't the Einstein's that I normally go to, but I would go out of my way on my day off from work if I had a bagel craving."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.. They were out of the majority of bagels.. We had 2 options. The first gal did not say a word to us, she stared at me until I started to order. The cashier told us to \"hold on\" because she couldn't figure her till out and the second cashier walked away when we turned to him to help us. They handed us our drinks and food with \"here you go\" not even eye contact!! The manager stood there watching this entire interaction. What a terribly disappointing place. Every other einstens is so decent. Driving all the way up to eastern for the other location is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Seriously, why is there always a long wait! It's just babes which are already made!!! - you either need to train your staff better or have more people.  This shouldn't take so long. Every time I come here is the same.  Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Just a bunch of young kids with no type of personality. My brother ordered a coffee and had to approach the cashier who had already prepared the coffee but figured it was best if he left it sitting in the blender for a bit longer or in this case, until the customer asked to have it. Boyfriend got his potato salad thrown at him, and may I add we each ordered combos and only one of us received a pickle that we paid for. First and only time I come to this location."}
{"text":"Oh man... Greeted with a \"Hello\" at the door the second I opened it. I looked up just in time to see the dead eyed young lady look back down at her register. 

If I could sum up my experience with a simple phrase it this \"going through the motions\" 

I shouldn't be the one to say Hi at the reg first, and thank you first.

People were there, in the building, but they weren't present. No smiles, just feigned indifference.

I always order Nova Lox on a pumpernickel with no tomato. I totally got tomato, I always get tomato. There's 5 ingredients... I don't want 1 of them. That's it, that's all."}
{"text":"A chocolate chip dry bagel took 4 tries to get right with a wait time of over 20 minutes on a Wednesday morning. Do not waste your time."}
{"text":"Came in with a group of 13 people this morning and ordered as one order. The food was out in a timely manner - especially for a group of 13 people, plus the food was delicious. Very good bagels and very nice people working"}
{"text":"I grab a cup from these guys every morning at this location. Great, friendly service

They have the best coffee, fresh, strong never burned. Jeanie is the one you want to help you when your there. She makes you feel at home."}
{"text":"I can't believe people actually choose to come here.  I came out of necessity.  And I don't plan on going back.

The system that they have is ridiculous....one guy takes down your name and order and passes it on.  The next person prepares your order.  And another person rings you up.  Then you sit and wait as all the people behind you get their bagels first.  I think \"plain bagel toasted with cream cheese\" threw them for a loop.  I mean why not get Dutch apple with walnut honey cream cheese?  If you want a pastry go to a bakery, not a bagel shop.

Anyways, seeing as everyone was clamoring for them I thought that maybe I would be getting a good bagel.  It was truly awful.  It was so mushy and chewy...there was no nice crisp outside.  There was no yummy fluffy inside.  It was just round chewy bread."}
{"text":"Love this location and the employees are friendly and fast. Only suggestion is to never order a soda fountain drink from here. Their soda machine is always flat and not carbonated. I try it every time and always end up throwing my cup away before I leave the store. I tell them every time too."}
{"text":"I have come here many times. Not once have I been greeted with a smile, been told thank you or anything of the sort. The kids at the registers have serious attitude. All they do when they are done is point at where you should go to next."}
{"text":"Stopped by for coffee and a bagel sandwich.

All but two of the coffee urns were out of coffee.

I ordered the bagel breakfast sandwich with what was reputed to be eggs with bacon and cheese.   The eggs resembled an egg substitute rather than real eggs.  The flavor supported that assumption.    The cheese at least tasted like real cheddar cheese.

Between ordering and after eating no one had refilled the coffee.

The staff were friendly enough despite being disengaged.

All in all I won't return to this Einstein's and won't order anything other than a bagel should I visit another.

I would have been better off at the Starbucks which is less than twenty yards away."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times in the span of 2 weeks. Not enough staff, none friendly and always out coffee it seems like."}
{"text":"I don't know why I bother anymore, honestly. Their bagels are good and all but they need some quality control on their specialty coffees. I asked 3 TIMES for a hot pumpkin spice latte and not only did I still end up with it on ice (I took it as is because they were busy and I was in a hurry), but it was also disgusting. Way too sugary for adult taste, in my opinion. They need actual trained baristas. They can't even make a proper macciato."}
{"text":"I went to the Einstein Bagel shop in the Hyatt on January 12, 2009. I had a gift card that was given to me December 2008. After ordering my food I handed the gift card to the clerk to pay and she told me that they don't accept the gift cards at their shop. Now, this is not an Einstein Bros at XXXX location gift card, it is a national gift card promotion. 
Pretty slick to sell people gift cards that they can't use - what a great business plan!
I doubt that I will be returning to this shop or to any Einstein's"}
{"text":"We enjoy Einsteins bagels and coffee. Unfortunately this one is not well maintained or staffed. Men's restroom is always a mess, broken towel dispenser for weeks. Employees come in late an nobody seems to care. Frequently understaffed. Too bad. Bagels and coffee continue to be good."}
{"text":"Service is variable as is selection of bagels. The criticism is that the bathrooms and patio are shared with Starbucks and no one seems to maintain them. Bathrooms are rather disgusting and need full remodel."}
{"text":"Decent bagels (lots of flavor choices), multiple choices of reduced fat cream cheese, BOTTOMLESS COFFEE!!

Large, comfortable shop, would be good for studying or just having a nice, simple meal. Staff was friendly, they even bring your food out to you! Bathrooms were nice and clean."}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches you can get from Einstein's.  I like getting my food and eating outside.  I visited with my friend for a few hours and it was so nice.  

The food itself was good.  There were only two people working and they were very slow.  My friend and I amused ourselves with chit chat while waiting for our order.  And waiting.  And waiting.  The man who took our order didn't think to give us our cups so at least we could prepare our drinks.  I finally asked for the cups.  We had plenty of time to observe how the food was prepared for us and the folks before us.  The preparation was very slow and appeared to be unorganized.  

I would make a suggestion to management to think about a little more efficiency training for the employees.  Seems to me the shop might make more money if customers knew they would get taken care of quickly?

Again the food itself is fine, it is the management of employees that needs some work.  I hope to try this shop again later and see if the situation turns around."}
{"text":"Nothing better than a bagel on the way to Mt. Charleston for a day of hiking!  The Dutch Apple bagel is outstanding. Wish I could have one every day."}
{"text":"It's alright, the prices and taste I would say is fair. Nothing super special about the price or flavor to make it unique to me."}
{"text":"Poorly run Einsteins and the manager was rude. How do you runs out of your most popular bagels on a weekend??? Should be baking bagels all morning long on the weekend. Won't be coming back for a long time"}
{"text":"The workers were extremely friendly and the bagels were amazing. All you can drink coffee?YES! I wish we had one of these in California and next time I go to Arizona I will make it a top priority to come back."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a post-lunch snack for my connecting flight from LAS.  Since its Year of the Monkey, I got the Plain Bagel with Nutty Monkey spread - can't go wrong with nutella, bananas, and sliced almonds!  Bagel was good (soft and chewy) and they did load up the toppings.  

I last came here some three years ago - so I'll keep the 4-star rating.  Much better food option than 360 Burrito I think."}
{"text":"I really like this einsteins. The people don't act like they're pained to work here. I live at Gilbert and baseline but I'm done going to that location. They're messed up my sandwich the last two times, and all seem miserable. At this location, Moses is wonderful. He's made my sandwich both times I've been here, it's been right, and he has some personality and a smile-even at 5:45 am. Nice guy."}
{"text":"This location must be under bad management because although the food is always good about 50% of the time they screw up my order and forget something. Like today I ordered a tuna bagel with potato salad. They forgot the potato salad and the TUNA on the damn bagel!"}
{"text":"2nd time we've come here and 2nd time they haven't put enough cream cheese to even cover 1/2 the bagel. Make sure to ask for extra. I've never had that happen at this chain, usually it's the opposite with too much. I'm not surprised this location gets such bad reviews. Cheap much?"}
{"text":"The staff here is extremely polite and courteous. I haven't been to a Einstein bagels in years I completely forgot how delightful the food is here. I ordered two bagels which only took about 3 minutes to make. If your looking for some fast service I definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Everyone was rude talk about no customer service! The bagels were burnt had to send it back and the lady was really upset brought me another bagel and again it was burnt... I will not be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Not happy with the customer service. We went in for the $6.00 Monday special for the 12 bagels in the box deal and the lady who took our order immediately said: \"would you like to pick a box?\" I guess they pre-pack the bagels for these deals. We said \"No\" as we want to pick our bagels ourselves. She gave us this irritated smirk as if we were making her life super hard and we're wasting her time. I then said: \" Thank you for letting us choose. \" to which she responded with a look that made me feel stupid.  No words came out of her mouth to acknowledge my thanks, just a dumb look of irritation was given to us.  As far as I am concerned, PAYING CUSTOMERS HAVE A RIGHT TO CHOOSE ITEMS THAT THAY ARE PAYING FOR REGARDLESS IF THE ITEMS ARE ON SALE OR NOT. I've been at this location before and I have been happy in the past, but today, today was a whole other experience all together. In my opinion they need to fire all of the employees who are currently working there and hire and train new ones who could give good customer service to patrons."}
{"text":"This location is always out of plain bagels. I was there a week ago and they were out I went this morning and again they were out of plain bagels also customer service is not the best at this location. You want good service go to the location on Sahara and Decatur."}
{"text":"Don't ever ask them to remake something for you when they get your order wrong because it'll look like they pulled it from the trash."}
{"text":"The service here is alla fast and friendly. Every time I come here, they are bisy but never miss a beat. The food comes out fast and without interruption. The breakfast sandwiches and the potato salad really shine!"}
{"text":"Just got a bagel with expired strawberry cream cheese. It smells awful. I don't know how they wouldn't have known. Super disappointed. I've called several times and no one will answer either."}
{"text":"I arrived on a Sunday at approximately 09:45. It wasn't busy and their selection of bagels was at bare minimum and they were out of the most popular bagels. The six cheese is my favorite and I usually order a 1/2 dozen but they were out. When I got to the register, the cashier/greeter didn't even say hello or welcome. I stood there waiting for him to ask me what I wanted but he never said anything. Wrong person to have as your greeter. I finally asked when the next 6 cheese would come out and he said, we don't have any right now. Very confused. I then asked when will they be ready and he went to ask the bagel maker which replied 6 to 12 minutes. I decided I couldn't wait and ordered a 1/2 dozen assorted. I ordered 2. Sesame, 2 everything and 2 plain. The greeter then gave me 3 everything and 3 sesame. I explained to him that I only wanted 2 of each and he gave me an attitude. What happened to customer service? Being in the restaurant business for over 40 years, I was kinda disappointed how bad I was treated just for some bagels. This is not the only restaurant they have that has been disappointing. 
It should be easy going out for bagels. Get in line, Get greeted, put your order in, they repeat it back, they up sell and offer anything else, you pay, they say thank you and you give a tip if you're satisfied. Tip, means To Insure Promptness. Sorry Einstein's, bagels, ambiance and a place to hangout might just be your local grocery store. By the way, when I got home, 4 of 6 bagels were rock hard. No consistency. Last week, bagels were undercooked and doughy. 
I go out to eat more than an average person, and I only write something when the company needs to know its bad otherwise nobody will say anything. When its great, I will also speak my mind. This was a bad experience."}
{"text":"Fastest Einstein bagel I have ever been to. Super nice employees that work hard together."}
{"text":"RUDE, LAZY AND ...Enter today...1 person working with a line...finally takes my order then has to be reminded on more than one occasion the details of a bagel and coffee order...then another employee,  a lead or manager (stocky Latin woman) comes out of the back after the one employee went back and ask her to come out as long was line what she was doing in there no one knows she came out did not listen to anything he said screwed up the order even more and when the UPS driver arrived to deliver some type of package he asked her for a signature she ignored him and then ask another employee for her last name as he didn't really need a signature she again ignored him as she ignored me when she was doubling up on my order because she wouldn't listen to the guy AZ who already toasted my now cold Bagels. Then suddenly another employee comes in from the Jamba Juice next door where he was Jabberjaw going with his Pals next door while the line built incredibly long and slow because of this lead or manager who is rude unprofessional and completely out of line.."}
{"text":"Never seem to have what I want. How do you run out of bagels at a bagel place? Always feel ignored when I go. Seems a little dirty behind the counter."}
{"text":"Prices just went up and quantity down. For $2.79 for plain bagel w cream cheese I expect some cream cheese... Staff today was nice though."}
{"text":"Love this location so much! The staff are always very friendly even when I walk in looking like a zombie and ask for something off menu. They have great customer service here!"}
{"text":"Love the bagels.  But . . . Need to have the boxes ready for grab and go. Never seem to have them ready when I get here, thus waiting in line contrary to the program. Bummer."}
{"text":"So I've been craving a bagel sandwich from this place for a while now and finally decided to feed that craving. BAD IDEA! I walk up to the cashier who is just standing there looking uninterested and dull, so I say \"Hi\" and she just responds with \"Do you know what you want to order?\" *Gasps* Wow I can't get a hello?I would've walked out had I known the sandwich was a waste of $6. The next cashier where I paid wasn't any better with any type of friendly greeting. I ordered the Santa Fe egg sandwich and was highly disappointed. The bagel was tasty but the egg was horrible. Won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Management team has really gone downhill these last 2 yrs or so!  I used to stop evey morning on my way to work but lately food is wrong, sloppy, missing or late etc.. I called to place an order this morning had a lil bit of static due to my cell and the lady says i cant hear you. BEEP. she hanged up on me as i was apologizing and adjusting my phone not even within 10 seconds. 1 I called back livid asking to speak to the manger and guess what she said it was her! No wonder customer service sucks there they don't even have a good leader! I'll be driving the extra 3 miles just to avoid this location!"}
{"text":"The cinnamon sugar bagels are amazing  the staff is super friendly and I'm always in & out!"}
{"text":"Okay, not sure where these other reviewers eat bagels, but Einsteins at 40th and Thunderbird MUST not be it.  I eat here every single week, and the place is clean and always packed.  The bagels and coffee are fresh, and the staff is very friendly.  I have never had a bad experience at this Einsteins.  BTW - Einsteins has the best bagels on the planet (and yes, I have eaten at Chompies.)"}
{"text":"Sometimes the line can get long so be prepared. Always good service and great food/well stocked."}
{"text":"Twice now I've waited 15 minutes in line without even having placed my order (Plain untoasted bagel with shmear) before giving up and walking out.

Nobody was behind the register taking payment. 


They need to hire more staff for the morning rush. The wait is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I hate to eat on the go but Friday afternoon I had about 15 minutes for lunch and decided to quickly go to this location. 

I have to say that for a chain I was pleasantly surprised at how good my turkey sandwich was. It came with a side of fruit and all on all pretty delicious. 

Line wasn't bad and service super sweet. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Worst service. Called ahead to place my order, waited in line to pick it up only to find nobody ever made it so I wasted the time calling ahead and waiting in an unnecessary line. Then when they finally figure out that they don't have my order they ask if I called this Einstein!! Ha!! Like it's my fault. Yes lady, I know how to use google. No apology, no concern, and an extra 10 minutes instead of saving time. At least it wasn't a bunch of sick people like last time. They honestly almost never do a good job at this location, I've lived nearby for 5 years and I almost always regret giving them my business."}
{"text":"This place is awful. The food was so bad. McDonald's has better food for you. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this no stars. Just moved to this side of town and during a hasty lunch break, decided to drop in for a quick bite.
My family and I went in shortly after 12:45 p.m. I got a breakfast bagel with cheese and egg, nobody else wanted anything so I was the only one ordering.
The sandwich came hap hazard with the top of the bagel toppled over and left on its side inside the basket exposing the cheese (which wasn't even melted!) Being in such a hurry, I took it as is and sat outside while the family went next door to Starbucks.

The sandwich filling was stale. I immediately regretted the cold cheese and the, what I could only describe as a cold egg sponge didn't help.. Gross. However, the bagel was warm and soft (??) I should have known something was wrong with the first bite. As hungry as I was, I couldn't bring myself to finish the other half.

Later that night, without going into too much detail..I experienced the worst symptoms associated with food poisoning. I hadn't eaten anything else that contained cornmeal that day or the day before, so when you know...you 'know.'

This place is terrible. You'd think with its location it would be a little more attentive to service and sanitation.

I wanted to love this place being so close, but maybe their food is better in the a.m.?
I won't be back. Ever."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick breakfast to go or in house. Clean restaurant and bathrooms. There's always a long line but the staff keeps it moving and are always friendly. The bagels are always fresh and delicious, with great seasonal selections (yummy pumpkin walnut crunch bagels!).

My \"GENIUS\" wish: add some type of gluten free breakfast option as well as a non soy, non dairy milk option to throw a bone to us with food sensitivities"}
{"text":"Einstein's really defines mediocrity. At best, it's just ok, on average, you will probably regret your trip.

For starters, this location is not set up very efficiently. For some reason, you walk in, then have to hang a hard right- navigate around people sitting down- then arrive at the counter. 

Jumping forward, the bagels are really, really boring. They're not terrible, they won't make you sick, but they're just so uninspired. Scottsdale has a handful of good, locally owned bagel stores where you can get a better bagel, at a much better price. After eating a bagel from there, I always kinda shake my head and ask myself why I don't just drive north a bit to a better bagel? Damn my laziness. 

I have a feeling that the same people that love Einstein's are the same people who think Applebees is amazing, and Walmart is a great place to shop. It's not their fault really, but sad nonetheless."}
{"text":"For long story short, skip to the bottom- 
I love Einstein's. The variety of bagels and shmear are great. The customer service is always fast and they have you moving along. At this location, all the employees are friendly and are prompt to get things done for you except when you ask for coffee to be brewed.. 

I ordered a bagel and coffee to go around 8:05 am and got through the line and checked out at 8:08 am. Fast, right? There was no autumn brewed coffee out so I asked when it would be ready and they said shortly. So I decide to eat my bagel there and check back in around 8:20 and ask of they're even going to make any and he said he would go in the back and check. He didn't give me an update so... I wait.  I finished the other half of my bagel  and check back in around 8:30 and they said in a couple minutes. I know I shouldn't have wasted my time, but I was curious to if they actually meant a few minutes so, I waited. I did not see anything out by 8:40 so I said \"fuck it\", sucked it up and got Vanilla Hazelnut coffee and walked out..

Long story short, their Autumn brewed coffee is my favorite (you have no idea) and after asking 3 times for it and waiting 40 minutes and it still was not ready, it would be faster for you to buy the damn coffee grounds and brew it yourself at home or at the office. I know, it's just coffee, but lets be real.. It's disappointing to specifically go in for your favorite coffee and not even get it."}
{"text":"UNfriendly service. BUT worse of all,they starting cleaning the grill before closing. They smoked us out of there!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location 5 times always  before 11 am.   Every time  they  are out of Onion bagels and try and shove the  others that over fill there wire baskets.    One would think  they would make more of the bagels they sell out of and not so many of the staffs favorites that end up  tossed.  I wont be back its not worth the time or energy."}
{"text":"I love this location and I love the staff! Fav bagel place in vegas"}
{"text":"I had a gift card for this place and decided to go one Sunday afternoon in November 2010. I wouldn't go again. They were only slightly busy but my sandwich took FOREVER to be ready. It's like it was the first day for the entire staff. The prices are pretty outrageous, too--a sandwich and salad was over $9.00, without a drink. Save yourself the annoyance and go to Bruegger's."}
{"text":"Keystone Kops run this one. out of ice at 3 pm who does that? bagel came with cream cheese spread so thin it was fugghedabodit. Took it back and new one wasn't toasted like the order. five people working at cross purposes. And airport bagels are not cheap!  company should be ashamed. Not up to their standards at all."}
{"text":"Not at all ilike the real boiled bagels.  These bagels are soft & get hard & dry when toasted"}
{"text":"This location should be avoided. It is dirty, unhealthy and disgusting. Most of the employees are rude and abusive. Orders are rarely completed correctly. It always appears to be the customers fault. Too bad the owner seems unconcerned. Needs a health department visit. Love Einstein Bagels, just don't enjoy being treated in this manner when spending money in any establishment."}
{"text":"Seriously the WORST Einstein's I have ever been to. They do not care about customer service at all. From what I've heard, they lack in management, so they probably don't know how to act or react properly. I go here often because it's near my work. Orders never right and when called out for it, they just act as if I'm being a pain. No, I want my order right and to taste good. My sandwich today not toasted, onions a huge mess, and wilted lettuce."}
{"text":"Always a great place to come for a delicious cup of Hazelnut Vanilla Coffee and a fat chewy bagel."}
{"text":"On the way to my hair appointment I was running late. At the last minute they called and pushed the spot back 45 mins. It must have been the universe's way of drawing me into my favorite coffee and bagel restaurant.  I happened to be driving by at that exact time through the intersection. Today I got the everything bagel toasted with half Honey Almond and half Onion and Chive cream cheese. I should have gotten both sweet because the Everything bagel was a bit salty and would have been better paired with a different sweet topping instead of savory. For coffee I had my usual Hazelnut blend, however, today I was feeling festively spicy and topped off my refill cup with cinnamon winter blend. Ahhhh...now I'm ready for my day to begin :)"}
{"text":"Went in on Saturday morning if was very busy but they were quick on the orders.  Bagels are pretty good.  We sat outside since inside was packed.  We ordered one cheese and French toast bagel they were delicious.  It might add they were not very large bagels like they have at a few bagel places I have been to.  My bagel was very light on the cream cheese but they tasted great."}
{"text":"I would give this Einsteins location a \"5\" rating for the bagels alone but the service and cleanliness of the food preparation area leaves allot to be desired, therefore a \"1\" star.
The service is atrocious. For example, one day this week, Wednesday, I stopped in fro a coffee and bagel. There were 7 employees working, one taking orders, one cashing and the rest preparing orders. Five customers in line including myself and nine (9) customers waiting for their orders. All you heard was \"sorry for the wait\" and this was not prime morning get your coffee before going to work time. 
The food preparation area is filthy. If you look at the counters and floors there is always food scraps laying about. 
I used to frequent this location two to four times a week but since the change of managers a few months ago, the quality of service and cleanliness has been lost. 
As much as it pains me to say so, I will probably go to Starbucks for my morning cup."}
{"text":"Great friendly service. Bagel sandwiches are good and never burned. Love the bagel clusters!!"}
{"text":"So happy this location is here!! I love coming in on Sundays and getting their lox and bagel. Great tasting coffee, too!"}
{"text":"Always fresh food and great staff. Two tips-You can ask for a freezer bag if you need one.  Also, the parking lot can get treacherous.. Look for the back way out onto Ft APACHE."}
{"text":"Love their cinnamon coffee!  Hands down better than Starbucks!  Bagels and sandwiches are also very good."}
{"text":"This is the WORST location I've ever been to and I really like EInstein. My co worker got breakfast for us and the messed the ENTIRE order up. Not to mention they were RUDE ! So we went the next day to get it fixed only to get back to work and find out they messed up AGAIN ! then told us they can't fix it anymore. What kinda bullshit . Never go to this location."}
{"text":"Every time I have gone here I have had a horrible experience. My trip in yesterday is what led me to write this review to hopefully save some people from going in there. First I ordered hot chocolate and the cashier told me the hot chocolate machine was broken so I had to get lemonade. Then, waiting for my bagel I saw other workers calling customers over to get their hot chocolates. Before paying, I tried telling the cashier about a coupon I had but she snatched my credit card and swiped it before I could get two words out. Her response: \"Oh well I already swiped it.\" Rude. Not to mention she had a blue dead tooth that made me lose my appetite."}
{"text":"Jammed in for a late lunch on a recent weekday. Found it strange that young female manager decided to vacuum the floor at 3pm despite not closing until 5pm. She did ask and I said go ahead, but other customers entered after and it probably wasn't a great choice. Granted, the place was a bit dirty, but use a broom and sweep up during the day. The turkey sandwich was pretty standard at about 7 bucks served with chips. The highlight of this sandwich was the soft potato roll. Get there early before they start the vacuum."}
{"text":"Fresh hot coffee clean facility. 3 present employees visible, no acknowledgment by any of them for almost 10 mins. 1 other customer being helped by what looked like the manager, lady in red shirt. Other two employees not sure what their duties were but got no help or acknowledgment from them. Manager was apologetic for the wait gave a 23 cent discount for the wait, whatever thanks I guess. I don't want anything free, I just don't like to wait for an empty cup to put my coffee in 10 mins."}
{"text":"Five stars for the friendly morning staff woman who makes the best mocha in town. Seriously. 

One star for the other employees who seem to hate their job and serve your bagel with a side of resentment. I asked for a schmear, not a sneer, people."}
{"text":"By far the worst Einsteins I've ever been to. Terrible customer service and so very slow. No matter what time or day, I'm waiting for at least 15 minutes. For a bagel!!
The employees are dirty and dingy and even the store manager wears her hair down and hanging over the food as she makes it, disgusting.
It's a shame this is the only Einsteins near me, I love the other locations, this one is hands down the worst."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, I'd skip dinner and lunch for ten years if I could be guaranteed awesome breakfast. 
I am especially partial to breakfast sandwiches, and lemme tell you, this place has the best. I've never had a bad-tasting sandwich from them
and their coffee..*drool* 
the service is really great too! There's this short, blonde lady with glasses who works the register and she's the sweetest person ever
when people visit me from out of town I always take them to Einstein"}
{"text":"We are regulars at this location.  I love the staff (Michelle is incredible) as is just about everyone else. Yes, they microwave eggs, but they microwave real eggs (not the nasty egg food stuff) and everything there is always so fresh. As a bonus, they are very sweet to children and dogs."}
{"text":"oh my savior!  you're the best thing to happen to me today! and i had an extra horrible day traveling.  i was so lucky and so happy to fall upon this place.  so i look up at the menu- breakfast all day! hooray!  i had an ear to ear smile when i saw my options.  i got a spinach, tomato, and provolone omelet on a toasted sesame bagel.  oh god did that hit the spot.  tomorrow i'll have the veg-out sandwich!

waiting for my order, i saw the coffee station.  a row of coffee makers that had TIMERS on them!  fresh coffee!!  another slice of heaven today.  what can top this?  SOY milk can, and it did!! i had to try the neighborhood blend since i'm not from around here.  i've done my cultural duty. it was yummy.  

i totally scored!!  yay for me for finding this place.  (it's part of the hyatt, but i'm staying at the wyndham)"}
{"text":"The coffee at this location is awful- please go get lessons from the lady at the Thunderbird and 40th street location.

However, the primary morning guy, Shawn, is awesome. He is friendly and chipper, but not so much so that he's annoying as your first human contact of the day. He is generous with the toppings and speedy."}
{"text":"This location is awful. My husbands breakfast sandwich was cold. I was given the wrong bagel and it was stale. I specifically asked for no shmear and it was loaded with it. Do not recommend this location. It's really not that hard to get a bagel order right but apparently this place can't follow basic instructions."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location weekly for over 10 years.  My kids and husband absolutely love Einstein's and this is the closest to our house.  But it's horrible and has been for a long time!!   A few years ago they had a manager than did an OK job...but the last 3+ years it's just gone down hill. So many times they have run out of bagels early in the day.  My whole family eats plain bagels or cinnamon sugar bagels (which are made from the plain bagels) and they are out more times than I can count.  How do you constantly run out of plain bagels....and I'm talking by 10am.  This morning they didn't have any left and it was 8:30am.  They just look at you like it's your fault.  And I can't tell you how many times I've gotten home and my order was incorrect. Employees and managers there just come and go....there's no longevity. When at all possible I go to the Lake Mead location or the Centennial Hills location.  Both are so much better run.  Einstein's Bagels are amazing....but I suggest going to any other location besides this one!"}
{"text":"What is the most you would pay for a bagel? There has to be a glass ceiling for this item. I thought this piece of dough that costs about 20 cents per bagel to produce could not possibly soar over the dollar mark. Well, at Einsteins it is now $1.15 for a regular bagel and then they have prices for specialty bagels ($1.25 ...and how the hell did a sesame bagel become specialty?). Then, there is a third category of bagels for cinnamon and green chile and wackier stuff that are about $1.50 a shot. They also each have their own price with cream cheese or butter. This is freakin absurd... what is going on with corporations and bagels in general these days?. Oh and the bagels are just pretty average to boot. These greedy bastards should be ashamed of how they treat the poor bagel, which used to be a poor man's food back in the first great depression."}
{"text":"Ok, it appears the annoying greeting policy has changed back to \"Good Morning\" The gourmet bagels are a stretch at 50 cents more than a normal bagel. My gourmet bagel was a six-cheese version and no I did not ask the cashier to rattle off all six cheeses that were included in the bagel. None of the cheeses on my 2.40 bagel with butter really stood out and honestly I really seem to be going here mostly out of convenience when I'm close, but not actually saying to myself, \"OK, let's go to Einstein's. I still think that places who get you back with a coupon on the register receipt are smart or maybe I'm just the type they seek. You fill out the code and then get a free $2 coffee with a purchase. Not a bad deal, but we all know these aren't the world's best bagels, especially for ex-Ny'ers."}
{"text":"Updating my review.  This has become my go to Einstein's since it is walking distance from my home.  The staff is friendly and orders are good.  At times seems a little understaffed."}
{"text":"Stopped there on my way to work.  The bagel I got tasted like dirty mildewed water.  I don't know if this was due to what was cooked in the toaster before or bad butter or what but it was truly inedible.  The only reason they don't get one star for this experience is that it is the absolute first time I have had an issue at Einstein's."}
{"text":"I love Einstein in general.  This location is by my doctors office  Staff was friendly.  Bagel was excellent.   No complaints."}
{"text":"yummm fresh bagels and different cream cheeses. I liked honey almond yumm! I also liked their bagel sandwiches i got this fancy one with asparagus plus their coffee is unlimited refills and do it yourself. Only downfall it has limited hours :( free wifi!"}
{"text":"Fast service good bagel Sammy! Apple wood and bacon cheddar is where it's at! I had the coffee with vanilla and hazelnut. I like that it's never that busy here."}
{"text":"We went there are 8:30 and there were very few bagels.  We went again at 1:00 hoping they'd restock, but no...every time we've gone there in the past few months there has been a nearly empty bagel case.  Note to Einstein:  YOU SELL BAGELS.  YOU SHOULD HAVE THEM.  This is the absolutely WORST Einstein bagels I've ever been to and we will not be going there again.  Save your money and go across the street to Panera Bread (by the mall).  They ALWAYS have bagels, the staff is the best, and they get your order right.

This Einstein has horrible management if they don't realize that they should have EVERY bagel in stock during breakfast at least.  Change managers now."}
{"text":"I  have been  stop by this place to get my breakfast recently . food  was good and the 2 ladies  in the front (cashier) always been nice."}
{"text":"I used to hate that Einstein's was the only bagel place on campus, cause i loved Bruegger's so much better.
I've since grown to enjoy these bagels more. The service here was usually pretty quick (sometimes you only have like 10 minutes between classes) which was nice. 

it's nice that it's located on the outer corner of the MU building, as it can get packed in that building, and it it's got it's own entrance and exit."}
{"text":"I have to start out by saying i love these bagels. Asiago. Yes. Apple cinnamon fritter bagel thing yes. I just want to shmear all the shmear all over my body. BUT. Every time I'm here. I just get frustrated. It's busy here which is great. But they are so understaffed. The person taking your order takes 3 orders then runs to be cashier. So you're waiting twice. Three times if you include waiting for the bagel. In my opinion.... either do all of the ordering and payment at once.... Or hire someone to take the orders and hire someone else to be cashier and hand out. So annoying. Especially when your hangry."}
{"text":"Eaten here twice and had great food both times.  Decent prices considering!!!

I got a Nova Lox bagel at 2pm on Sunday and through an array of unforseen happenings, I didnt eat it until 5pm.. Still tasted and looked great!!"}
{"text":"I was surprised by the low reviews.  I had a very good meal here recently.  Extremely friendly manager when we visited on 9/1/12 at about noon."}
{"text":"The place is pretty good when the manager is on duty. But when it's just a bunch of kids running around in circles the wheels fall off. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Einsteins, but this location has turned to crap! I've been coming to this location since they opened,  at least 18 years ago, I can't even remember it's been so long. Recently something has changed. The customer service is horrible, the food is mediocre and the place is dirty! 

I went in last Sunday and after this experience I will go to another location from now on. There is a young man that works there with red hair, his name starts with a J. The name tag was smeared so I couldn't make it out. He was making the food and wearing gloves but he kept touching his hair and face with the gloves on and then touching the food!!!! That's disgusting! He has longer hair for a guy and kept sweeping out of his eyes and touching his sweaty face. That's definitely a health code violation. The food trays are nasty! They look like they haven't been washed in months. Half of my bagel didn't even have cream cheese on it.

The employees are lazy. There was a huge line and one female employee decided it was time for her break. When there is a line out the door you don't just go on break. 

The manager is completely rude. She has a Russian accent. The ice lever on the soda machine was laying on the side of the machine. I went to tell her the ice machine was broken and she said \"no it's not, push harder!\" I told her there is no lever and she gave out an angry sigh and went over to the machine. She saw the lever and said \"oh my god! Who did this!!! Who did this to my machine?!?!\" So rude and inappropriate!! Such an angry woman shouldn't be a manager if she can't be pleasant to the customers.
 
Avoid this location and go down the street to the one on Buffalo and Lake Mead."}
{"text":"Maybe I caught them at a bad time, but despite the fact that they were slow, it took seven minutes to make my iced coffee. Everything else seemed much more important.. Like casually wiping the counters, walking around and chatting with coworkers. I am typically patient, but was in a hurry and found it to be rude. Not a single smile, nothing. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"So this place is pretty new. I'm the first to review! Located on Flamingo and Arville, Einstein Bros Bagels is located next to the Palms and specifically the Palms Place, where I was staying. While I'm bummed that I'm checking this place out on my last day in Las Vegas, I'm glad I came. It was my first time ever to an Einstein Bros and hopefully not my last. 

The staff is friendly and genuinely greeted everyone who walked in. It's bright and airy in there, perfect way to start your morning, even if you've had a few the night before. 

I ordered the breakfast thintastic bundle. For $4.99 I got a bacon and egg white panini and a medium coffee.  It was tasty but like your typical fast food marketing tactic, the picture looked way better.  

Overall this place did a good job. Check them out!"}
{"text":"This place is a disaster in the morning.  Never opens on time.  Everyone is sleepy;  Rubbing their eyes and face with their hands.   
The place is dirty.  Looks like it's been in business for 10 years."}
{"text":"Please update your online menu Einstein Brothers.   I was told by 3 different locations near me (Glendale, AZ) that the menu I was looking at online was 2-3 years out of date.  So two of the items that I wanted were not even available anymore."}
{"text":"Great bagel shop. It's just down the street from the Gold Coast Casino and Hotel in a small strip mall.  I got a bagel with asparagus, mushrooms and egg white with a small bit of orange sauce drizzled on for 270 calories.  My son got a toasted bagel with Salmon Smear.  I also got a hot chocolate and a large premade yogurt parfait with fruit and granola and we paid just over $12 for everything.  Great deal and everything tasted great.  Nice light alternative to the hotels or for the ride back home."}
{"text":"Been to Einstein's for a breakfast and two lunches. The food was fine for what it is - it's a chain and the food is all commissaried.  Nevertheless, I did enjoy the different sandwich choices on the thin bagel and the fruit is fresh, not frozen."}
{"text":"Ordered two bagels at 7:19 pm and didn't get them until 7:42 pm. 6 people and you are in the weeds, bad form"}
{"text":"Bagels and food are good. Nothing wrong with store or people who work there. 

BUT The process to place a catering order is painful. I already had an account set up. I called in for a dozen bagels with cream cheese. That's it. That's all. It took 12 minutes to place it. Little long for a simple dozen bagels."}
{"text":"Don't order the applewood bacon cheddar this is what it looks like they give you a bagel with no melted cheese and hardly any bacon in that picture looks a lot different there is lots of bacon and meted cheese. Not !!!!"}
{"text":"Just finished an egg, spinach, bacon sandwich.  It was filling and priced appropriately.  It needed a sauce of something herbaceous and then would've deserved additional stars.  No napkin in the bag.  Glad I had one in the car!"}
{"text":"They would not grant my free bagel coupon after I spend $32 because she had already ran my card. Really? What a joke never going back again."}
{"text":"The Einstein Bagel on 7th & Bell has the most awesome employees working there. If I am in a blah mood,  I stop there cuz I know I'll leave happy. Peter, Cody & Terri work their butts off to consistently deliver the best service possible with the best attitude. Unfortunately the genius of upper management seems to have decided to save some of the low hourly wages for profits at the top because they've had less people staffed lately. How sad! The staff literally RUNS to continue delivering their amazing service but, unfortunately, when they burn out, management won't understand that great employees like they have now cannot be replaced. Hopefully someone above starts to realize this staff is amazing & needs to be appreciated."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for a quick breakfast.  Prices are normal for the location and industry.  Saturday and Sunday mornings they are really busy.  If you are in a hurry, it can be a bit frustrating.  Parking is limited, but people tend to get in and get out fast, so parking spots tend to open up quickly.      

Standard leaded coffee is good.  Recommend the breakfast bagel sausage sandwich on a six cheese bagel and their fresh squeezed orange juice.  Service is good.  Everyone is hustling and trying to get people thru as quickly as possible."}
{"text":"We waited over 20 minutes to get 2 bagels toasted with cream cheese this morning. Better help is needed at this store. Usually a great place to grab bagels."}
{"text":"Einstein is a chain that is well known for their bagels, but there is actually more than meets the eye here. I do come for bagels, a baker's dozen with 2 tubs of shmear is reasonably priced at around $13. Shmear is what they call their cream cheese, and comes plain or in other yummy flavors like strawberry, chive and smoked salmon (my fav). They have lots of delicious bagels to choose from, including specialty flavors such as 6 cheese, pumpkin crunch (seasonal), jalapeno, and more. These specialty flavors are a bit extra $$ though.

They also have delicious pastries. The chocolate chip coffee cake is amazing, as well as the pumpkin muffin (seasonal).  

I enjoy coming here for lunch and getting the chicken salad sandwich which is very tasty. It has chunks of white meat chicken, celery, dried cranberries, and toasted almonds. Then they add lettuce, tomato and onion. It's definitely one of my favorite things to get there. Many sandwiches come on your choice of bagel, unless otherwise stated, and include a pickle and a side. If you sign up for their rewards club, you get a free bagel and shmear with any purchase."}
{"text":"First time going, I was happy with the service. Their menu looked delicious,  I got a ham and swiss egg sandwich. I am giving it four stars because I felt the portions aren't as big as they should be, I left still a bit hungry. I would definitely go back because their breakfast options were really good."}
{"text":"It should not take 15 minutes to get a bagel and coffee. And if it does there should be warning. Late today. Thank you"}
{"text":"This location is way too small for the number of customers they have.   Also, the staff is way too slow for the number of customers they have.  They close at 3 PM, but at 2 PM, they stop brewing tea and coffee, begin their closing clean up duties, and make it very uncomfortable to be in the dining room in the hour leading up to closure.    I know they place papers over the baskets they serve on, but it still would be nice to know they clean the baskets regularly.   Based on my photo, they don't. 
Save yourself 30 minutes wait time, and head to the much more efficient location at Ray & Rural.  I know it's a few miles out of the way, but seriously, you'll save a lot of time.
*****Additional Review******
8/27/17 - Stopped in this morning for a to go bagel, as I waited way too long for them to slap cream cheese on a bagel, I was able to people watch and observe the employees.   I saw one of them grab a bagel sleeve, place it up against another employees hair/neck, then put it back in the stack for the next to go bagel to be packaged in. One of the employees then started to crack eggs for cooking.   She started and cracked 1 egg without gloves, caught me watching her, then put a glove on and continued cracking eggs.   I was just people watching, but clearly she felt she was caught doing something wrong.
This place is always so slow and these actions guarantee that I won't be coming back to this location, no matter how convenient it may feel.    Ray and Rural continues to run circles around this location.  Perhaps they should consider cross training?
I can't remove any stars to give them a \"0\", so they remain at the lowest rating I can give."}
{"text":"Consistently good coffee and freshly made bagels - yum! This place is very calm and collected as far as being a haven for the locals. Always get our bagel fix whenever we are near Einstein Bros!"}
{"text":"Great staff, amazing food, and clean store. And the best Vanilla Hazelnut coffee on the planet!! I'm almost here daily! It's a great way to start the day!!"}
{"text":"I usually love Einstein's but I found a hair in my sandwich at this one. And it wasn't a little hair but a 3 inch hair or so."}
{"text":"I didn't go in to get my food, my boyfriend did.  And the food was great, he had deli sandwich and I had grilled cheese, I will go there again, regardless the size of the place."}
{"text":"This bagel place is in such a good location and the staff is destroying it. I have been to this location so many times just because its the nearest place from my house and they mess up my order every single time . Today they reached the limit , I ordered a veggie hummus sandwich bagel to-go. And guess what,  I see there is absolutely no hummus in my sandwich !! how anyone can forgot putting hummus on a veggie hummus sandwich is plain beyond me!  And since I was at work, I can't go back again just to get it fixed.  All i had was bagel and onions in them and literally nothing other than that :(

Also, they don't give you  any sides unless you explicitly ask  for it ! The other day my colleague brought over three sandwiches and didn't even know that they come with a side !

If I can deter even a single person from coming to this location, my last one hour of typing this review would be successful !"}
{"text":"I'm at this Einstein location practically every weekend.  I love the people behind the counter who are really helpful and friendly.  They always get my order right.  However, their system is extremely inefficient.  The line can be out the door and there is nobody there to take an order; they're either at the cash register or putting together someone's order.  The workers swap places with each other with no rhyme or reason.  One minute you're just about to give your order to an employee and the employee will walk away to do something else, leaving the other customers standing around waiting for somebody to come and take orders."}
{"text":"Such a great alternative to the casino food. I had a lox sandwich. Salmon was fresh and delicious! It is also very cheap, under $8"}
{"text":"First and foremost my wife overheard the mom of the cashier at the coffee bar say to her daughter cashier \"oh I'm surprised cops eat here don't they all like donuts\"...very disrespectful! 

Now about the horrible service, 25 minutes for a freakin bagel with spread? Ridiculous how you under staff your location on a Saturday in Vegas! Just ridiculous to have to wait this long for a FREAKING BAGEL with Spread, thank god I didn't order a egg one, may have been a freakin hour wait! Stay away, the buffets are cheaper and faster from start to finish, just horrible!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is always pretty good however the customer service is not up to par.  Me and my husband waited in line as the front counter lady looked at us skipped us and rang up the gentlemen behind us.  Not only that but we waited 20 minutes to get our food until we asked they forgot to make it . So seeing we were about to yelp them  they tried to bribe us with expired coupons. No thanks I'll drive the extra mile to a better location."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service.  I would elaborate but trust me when I say, they are happier to see you go than come in.  2nd time I've stopped, it will be the last."}
{"text":"Be VERY, VERY careful asking for a sandwich as a wrap. I ordered a ham and cheese make your own sandwich, ordered it as a wrap to go. I got home, there's lettuce and mayo and... what this? what's this I see in this sandwich? there's the cut-off fingertip of someone's glove lodged between the lettuce? (At least I hope it's the finger tip of a glove - I'm not even going to think of the other thing it could have been.) Ewwww.... gross.... I didn't finish the sandwich. Memo to self: Don't ever get wraps from Einstein's, particularly not the one on Shea. Disgusting. If it ever happens again, I'm calling a local news station to report it, then I'll call the state health department. Gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross... if you can't deliver sanitary wraps, THEN DON'T PUT THEM ON THE MENU. Not a place to go if you like wraps."}
{"text":"Friendliest staff ever! I'm only in the area for a brief amount of time, but have to say how quick, efficient, and nice everyone was! Really appreciate the warm welcomes and friendly smiles!"}
{"text":"Any place with unlimited free refills on coffee can have my undying love. I almost don't want the coffee lovers to find out about this place so I can have it all to myself. The staff here is always super friendly, attentive and accommodating. They even make me smile when I'm feeling the pre-coffee grouchiness! 

The food here is always great. My favorite is probably the asiago cheese bagel but I just tried the Tuscan and it had this great herby, pesto-like flavor. The free wi-fi is a huge plus too. I wish the hours were better though - it closes at 3 PM on Sunday. They could also use some couches... but then I'd probably get way too comfortable here."}
{"text":"This location is typically not busy at all. I don't think I've ever spent more than 5 minutes after walking in the door. We went in at 1:45 pm on a Friday; right after a soccer team and a softball team ordered. There were 3 amazing employees working their tails off. While we did wait 10 minutes for our food after ordering, it wasn't for want of trying by the team. They ended up out of turkey by the time they were making my sandwich and came out to me in the dining room and offered any substitution I wanted - major kudos for that. The place was clean, and I can't stress enough how polite and assisting everyone was. They could not have planned for two teams to come in at the same time and adapted very well to the rush. The coffee beverages are amazing, by the way. A few bucks cheaper than a Starbucks and almost identical flavor."}
{"text":"If you want a nice regular cup of dark coffee they have it! Half and half is always full!! My hubby loves their breakfast turkey sausage sandwiches!!"}
{"text":"Hey, it's not NYC, but if you are in the mood for lox and bagels, this is the easiest spot to go to in town.

Lines can be long early in the morning.

Enjoy."}
{"text":"The place is hopping early on sunday. We  stopped by to purchase bagels they have a large variety  they are very fresh . They lines moves quickly and also a large variety of smrars.staff is friendly . Only issue is their parking lot"}
{"text":"They made me a bagel that they were out of :)
It was super cold ac there during the summer which was good, but couldn't stay inside the store too long without being too cold."}
{"text":"i come here sometimes. their bagels are a little too greasy for me but they taste good so i come when i want a cheat day breakfast. the bagels are warmed to a perfect crisp minus the grease in the bag. i was served my bagel at a reasonable time considering a breakfast crowd. i like that they have a few chairs to sit outside if your heart desires. its a nice little quick place for food if you are in the mood."}
{"text":"Got a turkey bagel. It was good. Later on another day when I was running behind, I stopped in to get a bagel and a cup of cappuccino. The cappuccino was so hot it scalded my tongue, but the foam on top was like cold ... strange combination. I would not make a special trip here, but if I were starving I would come back ... I would just avoid the cappuccino ... it is vending machine quality anyway and certainly nothing special. The bagels are just ok, not really a NYC quality."}
{"text":"What can you say about Einstein Bros Bagels.   I have been eating their bagels for years and they are the best.  Saw that Vegas had Einsteins and the bagels here are just as good as the bagels at Einsteins in Utah.  I also recently tried Einsteins in Encinitas, California and they were good there.  If you find yourself wanting a bagel and decide to try Einsteins you will not be disappointed.   My favorite schmear is the honey almond.  Delicious...."}
{"text":"Worst customer service EVER! Sad too really because it's close, convenient and we love their bagels but the store is run so poorly. In all fairness their system is a little screwed up taking orders on one side of the counter and paying on the other end with no receipt or number so if there are several people in line you have to repeat your order while they search through recipes. The don't start specialty coffees right away causing them to never get made (I gave up on that one and got a refund). So I figure ok everyone has a bad day we went back BIG MISTAKE! while the bagel tasted great and I ordered a regular coffee this time they walk away without giving you a coffee cup for the self service station so you must ask. Then they can't make change for $100 which I can understand but NO ONE is in line and they are next door to chase bank with 5 people behind the counter and they won't get change in fact are appalled when I suggest so. I go next door explain to teller why I need change who shares the bank employees will not even go there anymore because of poor customer service. I return to shop and pay the girl gets an attitude with me saying she is working and can't possibly walk next door for change. Over all a horrible experience I'm interested to see how the store manager will approach this when I call and needless to say will NOT be back to this location ever again!"}
{"text":"The service is sooooooo bad, but I just can't resist the bagels....so I suffer through. I used to come in twice a week with my mom, but the service, attention, and product seem to get worse and worse.
Management is only concerned with getting the order taken(not always correctly) and I suppose getting through the shift. 
I have to say out off all the employees I have seen go through the place in my 3 years going to the restaurant-one is exceptional...\"D\". He is always smiling and providing prompt service with a smile. 
Hopefully this location gets a decent leader soon to pave the way for, at least, adequate service. Until then, I'll try steer clear :("}
{"text":"Had the hummus wrap while awaiting my flight. Nice quick snack, nothing to fancy but tasty"}
{"text":"Great place for a smaller breakfast, and pretty great coffee as well."}
{"text":"Store is busy today. Food's always good, but the bagel choices were down due to large catering order today. And oh my the orders are a bit jumbled. Einstein's is having an off day. I am wondering why napkins are not delivered with your order? I had to ask where they were. PS the napkins are buried in the drink area. I had to wait for drink people to get some. My bagel is yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is very small and gets crowded very quickly. It is a frustrating experience every time I go in there. People are standing around since there is little seating and the line goes right into the dining area. Too small! They are also pretty slow at getting the food out to the customers which is surprising since it's just a bagel shop. Their coffee is terrible, too.

The actual food is good. I get the Lox and haven't been disappointed, I just hate going in there to get it."}
{"text":"So I ordered coffee for myself and the cashier handed me a cup with a dirty rim.  I showed him it and he said, \"Yep, I don't know how that happened.  Let me get you another.\" He grabbed the stack of cups behind him and they fell on the ground and rolled on the filthy floor. I said, \"I think that's how it happened.\"  He went to the back and got a whole new roll of cups and threw the other stacked roll out.  I wonder how many times they drop things on the ground and don't toss it out unless someone notices.  Could that seasoning on the bagel be something else?

Based on my experience and the other reviews, there seem to be a bunch of lazy slobs working at this location and an overhaul may be prudent lest this one close up due to mismanagement and health code violations."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for 5 years since moving from LA.   The  bagels are Always fresh, the lox smear is my favorite along with plain cheese.   Great friendly service!"}
{"text":"Currently still here waiting for my two bagels, when I placed my order with girl (who wasn't wearing a name tag) blonde girl, nose ring who looked like she just rolled out of bed. She came over EATING, CHEWING HER FOOD with her mouth open trying to take my order & then I place my order and look up to the drink menu getting ready to order my coffee and she just kind of shooed me away and asked what she could start for the man behind me, then when I move over to the next counter to pay the lady didn't come over until she was done making my bagels which is unfortunate because I was hoping I could order a coffee from her but since I was on a time crunch and my food was there and ready I decided to skip on the coffee and she seemed very irritated when I started to order it anyways so I told her nevermind I will hit the Starbucks drive thru

Not to mention it was fairly busy for a Monday at noon and one male employee was sitting down at a table eating... WORST customer service i have ever received"}
{"text":"I enjoy going to Einstien's for their fresh bagels and sandwiches, and I'm even happier since this location was built out here in Centennial Hills. The service is outstanding in speed and friendliness, and the food is always good, you can count on it. The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because of the price of everything here which usually leaves me with a slight sour in my mouth at the end. I would suggest to anyone to go here at least once though!"}
{"text":"My low rating is mainly because of the terrible service at this location the food is the same as any other location. I live and work nearby so this is closest location to me, I do go here often and am repeatedly disappointed by the service. It's obvious the employees don't care about the customers or the service. My advice is to always check your order before you leave if you're taking it to-go, they will get it incorrect pretty much every time. They will also forget to add your sides, but still charge you for them!"}
{"text":"Typical Einstein's food. So it's the same everywhere you go. I love the bagels. This location is super slow. Not busy at all for a mid week lunch hour and it still took way too long for them to ring me up and make my sandwich. Some people have work to get back to!!!"}
{"text":"Giving them a second chance. Ordered bagels last week for my team of forty. Service horrible. Bill &150. Told the lady three times what I wanted. She kept arguing with me saying bagels that I wAnted were 60 cents more, I repeatedly asked for the better bagels and no cheap ones. She kept giving me cheap ones. I forced her to take some out and give me the good ones. She took some out, purposefully \"threw\" the good ones in and said she can't give me more other customers want them. Got 40 drinks and no help from anyone to collect them. Asked her if there was anything I should but for my team..... She said no..... Folks I can't make up this stuff...... She was awful, food was good , nothing organic on menu."}
{"text":"Who trains these folks??? Unbelievable how bad the service can be in a breakfast bagel establishment. It's pretty obvious the staff doesn't want to be here and it's shocking that one of the staff members with long hair decided to take his smoke break right outside where the outside eating tables are located. Nothing says a great experience like tasting a stale bagel not properly heated with the taste of a guy smoking 5 feet away from you after the cashier was rude to us. Not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I'm 32 years old and have never written a review, either positive or negative, but the service was so deplorable that I had to say something. I stood in front of the register for at least 5 minutes while the woman behind the counter was doing side work. She looked my direction several times and ignored me. Another employee emerged from the back, talking on the phone, and walked right by me to the side station where she also proceeded to perform side work. The other employee saw this and huffed \"oh my god, how can I help you?!\" She took my order but then refused to ring me up and said \"She can do the rest!\", looking at the other employee still on the phone, and walked away. I stood there for another several minutes until I interrupted her phone call to take my order. She took my order while still on the phone. Then it took a very long time for them to make my order as it appears they were still silently protesting to each other about who should do work, at my expense. Mind you this was at 2pm, 3 hours before closing and I was nothing it polite with undeserved \"pleases\" and \"thank yous\". Very bad hiring choices."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Einstein Bros since I was a little girl so it is pretty close to my heart. Still to this day, an Einstein's bagel is one of my guilty pleasures. It was tradition before every swim meet and sometimes I could convince my parents to take me before school on Fridays. In High School, we'd walk here for an after school snack! 

They're always friendly and as quick as they can be considering they do tend to get long lines in the busy hours of the morning. I love that they change their menu for the seasons but their turkey sandwich with onion and chive cream cheese will always be one of my favorites! I also love their ham and cheddar egg sandwich. 

I noticed today that they have Mac & Cheese bagels?! So crazy! They also have an avocado toast bagel. Way to stay on trend! Anyways, i'll be back soon for sure! :) Thanks for always curing my craving, Einstein's!"}
{"text":"The bagels are corporate tasting bagels and there is no getting around that.  The manager is outstanding and always has a kind word and smile.  I visit on weekends and always have a pleasant experience.  The staff would do well to hustle a bit more and speed up the weekend line.  A decent bagel in a great location.  Check the paper for good coupons."}
{"text":"Bagels are great. We love this location. My child goes crazy as soon as we pull up. Super helpful and cheerful employees. Overall great store."}
{"text":"Not friendly service and out of iced coffee on the day I went.  Consistently a not so good experience."}
{"text":"I work at a warehouse in the area of this Einsteins, I usually pick up bagels for the warehouse team at the Eastern Ave location near the 215.
Today I stopped in here.
I stood where the sigh says \"Order Here.\"
A tall young guy said \"We'll take your order down this way. Indicating toward the register.
About 5 minutes later (The guy in front of me couldn't make up his mind) a woman walked in. She was greeted by name by the tall kid who took her order right away at the bagel counter!

I find this to be very RUDE and inconsiderate!

I may have started buying bagels here but this first time experience at this location decided for me NOT to go back!"}
{"text":"I hope the manager of this location visits once in a while. He or she should see the chaos and lack of organization the staff presents to customers. Errors in orders. Long waits. No acknowledgement of any of it.  Last time at this one for us."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab breakfast! The line was a bit long but mid morning on a Saturday that is to be expected. I got the spinach mushroom and Swiss breakfast sandwich on an Asiago bagel add avocado and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Very helpful staff at the location up near north Prospect! They are friendly and remember your name. Really great service!"}
{"text":"The staff are the reasons we keep coming back!  My boyfriend always wears his Red Sox hat to Einsteins because it always starts some friendly bantering with the staff who seem to be Yankee fans.  They make us feel welcome in their restaurant, not like just another customer. It's always an enjoyable experience and the food is great! I have to give a shout out to Chris, the cashier, who always makes us laugh when we come in."}
{"text":"Great customer service! I was distracted when paying and forgot my change. The very friendly cashier came running it over to me. Love their everything bagels and lattes! It's always a treat to have breakfast at Einstein's."}
{"text":"I watched 5 orders get messed up within 15 mins.  Another person got the wrong order. Took it home then it was brought back and sat on the counter for 20 mins waiting for the other couple to come back and now get their cold order.   To many people and not enough paying attentuon.  And no it was not even busy.  And we sat so we could see everything."}
{"text":"My review is on EB bagels in general, they are just ok. A good bagel should be *firm* on the outside, and chewy on the inside. EB bagels are only slightly firm on the outside, and mushy in the inside. Go to Chicago (Kaufman's) or NYC to see what I mean. So I can't fault this location, but I guess they just play to the whims of the masses.

Second beef, (can't post the real price) is *ridiculous* for a bagel. There can't be twenty cents worth of labor, electricity, ingredients and overhead in that thing. Prices are just too high for what you get.

So bagels are meh, coffee is just ok, service is good, location is fine. Just nothing special or noteworthily here. Same as the one down the street.

Yawn."}
{"text":"Short Version: Always loved their bagels and their egg sandwiches. Always hated the long wait.

Long Version: I usually weight my ratings more heavily on food, but in this case, the wait and whole inefficient process of ordering just makes this such a terrible experience. What is the purpose of one person taking orders but not taking payment? How about just taking orders and payment and using the extra person to prepare the food so that we can get through the line faster?

As for the bagels, the Everything Bagel is my favorite with salmon schmear on one side and light plain schmear on the other side. My office order Einstein bagels for us every Friday so I usually need to get to the kitchen early otherwise the Everything Bagel has been claimed.

On the weekends, when the line is even worse, I like to order an Egg, Turkey and Cheddar sandwich on an Everything Bagel, but instead of the Turkey Sausage that is on the menu, I ask for Breakfast Turkey, which is just regular Turkey Lunchmeat. However, if you ask for Turkey Lunchmeat, they charge you an extra $1.50, but if you ask for Breakfast Turkey, it's free of charge. It must be a difference in portions. I also add plain schmear to one side, which is important because if it's added to both sides, your fillings will just slide out and your sandwich gets messy as funk.

Anyways, I was there this weekend and it took me, no exaggeration, 40 minutes from the time I ordered to when my name was called. Booooo!

Let's channel Einstein a bit more and get smarter with the ordering and preparing of food process!"}
{"text":"Very rude and poor customer service.  A great example of poor management and ownership here where everyone (6 people working) and they ignore you the customer.  I literally stood by myself for more than 5 minutes waiting to be acknowledged and wanting to place a single item order.  Behind the counter the \"team\" walked by numerous times without even a hello.  Also one of the dirtier Einsteins!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Einsteins in Vegas. I come here on each of my days off and I keep coming because of the great service and atmosphere. The staff at this location take their time when preparing your food, so it comes out neat and not sloppy. It's never too loud so it's a great place to grab a bagel and coffee and get some work done."}
{"text":"The bagels are good (particularly for Arizona).
The coffee is good.
The service is fast and friendly.
But, I came here to get some work done away from the office.
The Wi-Fi is terrible. I ended up having to tether to my phone."}
{"text":"If I can give location a zero, I definitely will. The people who work here are rude, no manners and they think they are better than the people who order food from them. Will I go back? It's a maybe. If I can order from postmates or Uber eats and have someone else deal with these rude employees, then sure. Otherwise, no."}
{"text":"I visited this Einstein's location today for a bagel and a coffee with my boyfriend today. When I walked in I didn't get a greeting or anything, just a cashier staring at me. After staring at each other for about 20 seconds, I guessed that was my queue to order. I was just surprised that I didn't get a hello or a greeting or anything. It was a little weird. Otherwise, my order was correct and tasted good. The cashier was just a little odd and the staff didn't seem to move very fast. I would visit again, but probably not at this location."}
{"text":"I usually come here for a dozen of bagels but haven't been here  in 2 months ... service was very slow today, seems like the last couple times i have tried this place has not changed. The bagels were fresh though ... just really slow service. Lot of selection and people behind the counter are friendly. Hope they stream line the process better"}
{"text":"Update: decided to give em another shot, and they really turned it around. I'm in here once a week and the staff is always super nice and helpful, haven't had a wrong order yet. Great Job!

Never going to this location again. They always screw up my order. Really frustrating to get home and find out your egg sandwich is missing egg, especially when you paid extra for two eggs. Also they must not know how the toaster works because all the bagels were untoasted even after requesting they be toasted. The only reason they got two stars is because they seem to be the only einsteins in town that makes enough everything bagels."}
{"text":"Yummy food and great staff. Never been here before today and they gave me the best suggestions!"}
{"text":"ALWAYS CHECK YOUR RECEIPTS!

Cashier charged me $10+ over and then asked me if I want my receipt. Of course I said yes, while I was looking at my receipt, she said, \"Actually, I need to reimburse you...\"! I don't even have to ask, she knew it and she was about to let me go without reimbursing if I hadn't asked for receipt!! 

Also same transaction yesterday morning: I have a $2 off any purchase and she asked someone else if she can apply the $2 off with the Monday $12 for 13 bagels plus 2 schmears promo. Her coworker's reply: \"I don't think so\". I told her it says on my account, \"any purchase\". They're so lazy verifying and they're okay with \"I think...\".
They're so stingy when the promo isn't going to be taken from their paychecks..

Oh, and of course she did not include napkins and knives. What am I supposed to use schmear as a dip? 

The one at warm springs and eastern is way better."}
{"text":"It's 1:00 and they are under staffed only one person place is filthy, not a clean table in the place and no ice in soda machine. The girl behind the counter never had a chance."}
{"text":"Plain bagels. All I wanted was plain bagels. At noon today they are out of plain bagel. Tomorrow is Hanukkah; do any of you young people that work here care? I stopped in for plain bagels for breakfast tomorrow since you will be closed on Christmas Day | Hanukkah. Lox and Plain Bagels. But you are out of plain bagels. Why? It is noon and you close at 4 but you are not making any more bagels. You have maybe 15 bagels total in the display case. How can you possibly be open 4 more hours? It just really peeves me that you are always low or out of Plain bagel. I'm going to Chompies the next time. We are over Einstein"}
{"text":"The staff are the friendliest and most hardworking people I've ever met!  Keep up the good work! This became my favorite go to einsteins ever!"}
{"text":"My son and I have birthdays a week apart. We are both members of the Einstein Bagels email club and so we each received a coupon for a free breakfast sandwich with a drink purchase. We decided to go there this morning and have a nice mother, son breakfast. The line to order was extremely long but I expected that being a Sunday morning. After about 15 minutes in line my son tried to place his order but the person taking orders didn't know how his coupon worked and told him to place his order at the register. I went ahead and placed my order for a breakfast sandwich, drink and a half dozen bagels (I didn't mention the coupon since she clearly didn't know what she was doing). I knew when I got the cash register they would know what to do. After placing my order we had to wait in another long line to pay (and for my son to order his food). The person running the cash register was also making the specialty drinks so that was what the hold up was. Finally after another 10 minutes my son placed his order, breakfast sandwich, mocha drink and a danish (the cashier shook his head when my son mentioned the person taking the order didn't know how the coupon worked). My son paid for his and then I went to pay for my food (we had waited in line for so long that my breakfast sandwich was already ready). I told the cashier I wanted a medium fountain drink also. He said that they were out of ice. Really!! He asked if the person taking the orders had mentioned that to me. No, she did not. I asked if they had bottled water, nope. I said fine just give me a cup for water from the soda machine (I don't need ice for that). He said that in order to get the free breakfast sandwich I had to make a purchase. I said I was, I was also getting half a dozen bagels. I guess the person taking the orders left that off. He tried using the coupon but it would not let him because I had to purchase a drink. Well I had planned on it but they were out of ice and didn't have any bottled water. He said I could buy a coffee drink. I told him I can't drink coffee. Meanwhile my breakfast sandwich was getting cold (since I had waited for so long). Instead of just apologizing and over riding the system and honoring the free sandwich he did nothing. I told him to forget the entire order and gave him back the sandwich and bagels. At this point I was so frustrated that my nice breakfast with my son was ruined my son decided he didn't want his order either and asked for a refund too (his food was already made also). At this point I figured they would have had the manager come and explain the situation and instead of losing customers and money they would honor the coupon. Nope, the manager came and just gave us our money back. I even explained the situation to her and she did nothing. Really! I guess customer service is lost. I will definitley not be coming back to this Einstein's again."}
{"text":"You think I would learn after several months to stop coming here but I didn't want to just give up on them. I'd been going to this location since we moved into our new house over a year ago. Everything started out fine last year. I usually go once or twice per week. Then sometime this year things started going down hill. At first every couple of times I came in they were out of cranberry. Then it started happening every time. I finally contacted corporate and complained to them that they were always out of cranberry. They contacted me back and apologized and said they were working with their stores on changing things and offered to send me some coupons. Months have passed and nothing has changed and I never received anything from corporate. We went in again today and this time they were out of cranberry (no surprise) but also everything, blueberry, wheat plus much more. The baskets were mostly empty. Then my husband wanted to order a smoothie and they were out of the mix too. Got home and found out they got my order wrong on top of everything else. I guess it's time to find a new bagel place."}
{"text":"I used my Yelp app to find a place that was open early for breakfast to grab and run. I found Einstein's at the top of the list and decided that it would be perfect for a light breakfast. Who doesn't love a bagel with cream cheese? Yum!

Got here around 7am and purchased a Baker's Dozen Box. They let you customize a box of thirteen bagels and two tubs of smear for $14.99! Not such a bad deal and the variety keeps everyone happy. I decided on a combination between savory and sweet-- garlic, cinnamon sugar, cinnamon raisin, everything, wheat, asiago, chocolate chip and blueberry. I decided on sun-dried tomato and cinnamon sugar smear-- SO BOMB. Back in LA, I do not have an Einstein Bagels so this was my first time. Usually I go to another chain called Noah's Bagels, but I was way more impressed with Einstein's flavors and customer service. The guy who helped me with my order was very pleasant and helpful. I also bought a reusable, plastic coffee mug! For $3 it comes with a drink at the time of purchase and then when you bring the cup back in, you can get a refill for a buck and some change. Sweet!

I definitely want to come back to pick up a sandwich, they looked really good. The coffee was also fantastic, I would be back again just to grab a cup of joe in the morning."}
{"text":"Personally there very rude it's holloween day and there are very rude. There is no line so they don't have to be so nasty. Butchy women and Hispanic women really should go back to school for customer service. Both talking under neath there breath! I would def not recommend to go here. Find another Einsteins!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location in awhile and I was appalled at the state it is in! The bathroom looked like a truck stop. The floors and tables were filthy. Even the prep area was an unorganized disaster! I mentioned to the manager about the state of the restroom and he didn't even apologize, he only half-heartedly offered to take a look himself, as if I was pulling his leg or something!"}
{"text":"It amazes me that every time I go to this location they never have anything left.   Hey Einstein maybe you should keep making more bagels so you can serve your customers!!   4 people had to get refunded because of wait time and horrible service!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Einstein's for over a year, but still ordered my old standby, Veg Out (hummus and veggies on a whole grain bagel). I started to order a newer sandwich, a thin crust chicken but the order taker's expressionless response changed my mind. \"Is it fresh, hot chicken on the sandwich?\"  \"No, but we do microwave it.\" Okay. No thanks.  Unfortunately, even my old standby had too thick of purple onions and far too much lettuce.  The three stars are for nostalgic's sake and quick, albeit not that engaging, service."}
{"text":"So i've been here the past three Saturdays in a row and here's what I noticed:

-The coffee is pipin' hot and I LOVE that-try the Vanilla Hazelnut. It gives Starbucks a run for it's money.

-The service at this location is indeed slow. Would never go here if I was in a rush.

-Friendly service. 

-There's been a line after 9am on Saturdays that keeps the place hoppin'

-This location is right next to a Coffee Bean, who would go there when they can go to Einstein's?"}
{"text":"I have no quarrels with this Einstein's location. My husband and I usually stop here on Friday mornings on our way to work and the service has been smooth every time. We've never had a messed up order and even though the line can get a little long I don't find myself waiting that long anyway. Coming to an Einstein's is a nice alternative from Starbucks when you're not diggin' that extra-chirpy barista. :)"}
{"text":"I love Einstein. I've never been to this location before but was super excited to try it. This location is getting three stars because the cashier was super rude to the lady in front of me and then had an attitude like he really just didn't want to be at work. I simply asked one of the workers if they had hot sauce at this location. She gave me a disgusting look and said no. This place doesn't have very friendly workers. Food was great tho!"}
{"text":"Nah.

\"Toasted\" to this place means \"a little warm and still soft.  Not crispy whatsoever.\"

Butter wasn't even melted.  Nor was it spread.  Just a clump in one corner of the bagel.  

Bagel is sub-par to \"real\" New York style bagels.  As far as bagel chains go, Brueggers is far superior."}
{"text":"I was in this place this morning and had to write a review despite not going very often because I was so pleased with my experience. I only go about every 6 months because its next to my dentists office so therefor its reasonable they have new management or staff every few times. 

This time i'm pretty sure the entire staff was new, it was very busy for breakfast but quickly died down because they had a really nice system going where they were able to take orders and prepare them in a timely fashion.

However I was especially pleased with the graciousness of all the employees, every one I encountered from the man who took my order to the lady who prepared my food and the man who rang me out was very friendly. All of them asked how I was doing and wished me a Happy Thanksgiving. Its that small amount of human interaction with genuine people that make for a great establishment. 

Lastly as always my food was great, the bagels never disappoint."}
{"text":"Schmear-licious.

I come here just to buy their schmears. Love the whipped ones and all the different flavors. My favorite has to be the herb, the second being the sun dried tomato. 

Their sandwiches are pretty tasty as well. Good amount of meat. Lots of schmear. Perfect size.

Beware if you come in the morning give yourself some time to get your bagels because it can be really packed."}
{"text":"The Brothers Einstein put together a mean breakfast bagel!  I'm talking abut the one and only Santa Fe.  Turkey sausage, two eggs (upgrade) jalapeño-cheddar bagel, and a delicious red pepper dressing.  This bagel, along with a cup of their joe is guaranteed to power you through lunch.  Please read the fine print on all of my guarantees :)

I've had lunch here too and they do excellent bagel sandwiches. I love how you can mix and match bagels to tweak the flavor of your sandwich.  They offer a nice selection of sides in addition to the ubiquitous chips.  I'd rather have a side of fruit over a bag of chips any day- ok, blanket statements aren't good. . .

The ordering process is very efficient and usually pretty accurate (they recently forgot the extra egg I asked for-the horror of it all!) The team is usually running at full steam and generally get the food out quickly and accurately-that's good enough for me for a fast-casual establishment.  

Free wi-fi if you're have their app and they are generous with the offers via the app also.  

Not perfect but who is?  Really enjoy Einstein's-hoping some of their genetic namesake rubs off on me."}
{"text":"Best place to go for coffee and a healthy breakfast option. So happy my friend introduced me to this place last year. This location is almost always busy. You can see whole volleyball and kids soccer teams come through. Always a great crowd. Last month I ran into friends I had missed for a while ~ I had no idea they randomly gather there ~ like an unofficial Bible Study. The coffee is great!! I always order an Applewood Bacon and Egg w/ Cheddar. An amazing value and so much better than any drive through! They have a patio where you can sit outside. There are little birds that come and hang out by you. It's fun like a Disney Princess cartoon. It is kinda close to the foothills, though, so it's smart to keep your headphones handy to muffle the screeching that occurs when some of the laidies land to patronize this fine place. I figure if the little birds can take it ~ so can I. I've even found an Einstein's up valley. Never a disappointment.  I recommend to all."}
{"text":"* * * TERRIBLE customer service * * *  I rushed home after stopping by to grab a turkey sandwich just to find out they left the key ingredient out - turkey.  So it ended up with a veggie sandwich.  I called them to let them know and they kindly offered me another sandwich next time I came in. They took my name down.   Today - I returned and they rejected their original offer.  I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Staff is always very friendly & helpful . One of the better locations I've been too . Pretty quick , even when I've seen them at their busiest && my order is always correct ."}
{"text":"So I dropped by today to get a bagel sandwich, walking by two seemingly unconscious customers that were staring agape at the menu without any signs of movement. I approached the counter and ordered my sandwich, with the subsequent reply that I could choose any kind of bagel for my sandwich. I asked if they had onion bagels, and the lady kind of just paused for a second as if I was an idiot and stated, \"I don't know. Why don't you look for yourself?\"

Fine, maybe I haven't been to that many Einstein's and don't fully understand the bagel selection. Not a big deal. However, after paying the only other employee in the restaurant for my food, the two of them backed into a corner behind the counter and began discussing \"this really cute guy\" and at least five minutes passed before any food was even seen behind the counter. It took a full 10 minutes before I even recognized the fact that they were making a sandwich.

Never knew bagel sandwiches could taste so incredibly mediocre.

Honestly, the most offense part of this journey had to be when the barely legal cashier called me \"hun.\""}
{"text":"I was craving a bagel sandwhich with egg bacon and cheese and I called the place to see if they also had croissant sandwiches and she said no only bagels and I said okay mam thank you. So I ended up going there because I was near and I tried to open the door and it was locked. The girl worker inside laughed at me because I couldn't get in so whoever that girl worker was, You're disrespectful for that. And the girl shouldn't have answered the phone if they closed at 4 because I called like 10 mins passed that. don't know if I'll be coming back"}
{"text":"This Einstein's bagels location continues to struggle with having, well....bagels. They are open until 3pm and at 11am, they had almost no bagels. I couldn't get the half dozen if my choice and left empty handed....again. Complete waste of my time going to a bagel shop that doesn't have bagels."}
{"text":"Stop by every once in a while for their coffee, not their bagels! They usually have a long line in the mornings, especially on weekdays since everyone seems to be buying dozens of bagels for their entire office. If you're just looking to grab a coffee or soft drink, just head straight to the cashier and skip the long ordering line.

I love that they have a self serve coffee bar, where you can get unlimited refills on the same visit. They usually have about 3 roasts available, including decaf. Their coffee has good flavor, especially the medium roast. 

They have a ton of seating, making this a great place to work or chill in the mornings whether you're grabbing a coffee or some bagels/pastries. Just wish they had a rewards program! If you come here a lot, be sure to sign up for their email list. They send out coupons about once a month."}
{"text":"Great service with smiles. Delicious bagels. Quick and easy. In and out. Best of all is that they don't look down on you for using coupons. :)"}
{"text":"Open early, close early.

Great place to get together with the ladies and have a bagel or cup of coffee [thats what i do every couple of weeks]

 Personally, i think they're a little over priced but so is starbucks.

This place gets crazy busy in the morning. Cross your fingers that you find a place to sit. Lines can be long but go by fast.

Not just a breakfast place but a lunch place too! They have bagel sandwiches, woohoo."}
{"text":"Frankly disappointed with this location. I immediately noticed upon walking in the dirty floors, and the fountain drink station ice dispenser was disgusting and covered in grime."}
{"text":"This location used to be a lot better in terms of friendly staff and cleanliness, but it goes downhill every time I visit. Today, the store was dirty, and the staff extremely rude - especially the employee who helped us at the register. While I did end up splitting my order into to separate transactions, it was a complete bill of over $30 and he couldn't even offer me a thank you when the transaction was done.
I asked an employee to open my lox so that I could put it on my bagel, and he almost refused; as someone who works at In-N-Out, where we are to say \"yes\" to any request within reason, I found this rude. Even worse was when he  complained about having 45 minutes left when he returned with my lox - something that I consider rude at any work establishment. I suppose nobody wears name tags so that you can't complain about them specifically!

Overall, don't waste your time at this location when the valley has far better Einstein Bros. to go to"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood place where I like to pop in a grab a quick meal on the weekends.  I love that they send out coupons too ; )  I get a bagel and lox every time!"}
{"text":"I'll keep my review short and sweet. The service was great and the food was good, I enjoyed riding a bike from the Western Kierland to get there. Overall, just like the others in the chain, the food was good and perfect for a short breakfast before a bike ride"}
{"text":"I have tried Einstein, I have tried.  I thought your Henderson location was a long wait, but you guys take the crown. I came in after a long softball morning wanting an egg, cheese, bacon bagel to go. The line was super short, but there were a lot of people seated at the tables and a few standing on the side of the register. Took 5 minutes in line for my order to be taken. Paid seconds later, and the wait begins. I'm not kidding, I watch order after order after order called out and taken to those at the tables. How do we not start making the order as they are processed is beyond me?  I waited 20 min for my order. I hear my name, YAY finally because I'm starving!!!  The guy behind the register, bless his heart, says \"So we just realized we're out of onion bagels. I'm so sorry.\" After 20 min of waiting, you guys just realized this and didn't make more based on the orders coming in?  I'm not sure I understand how THAT works either, but whatever, I said just give me the asiago one.  Again, 5-8 minutes waiting for that to be finished. I could have went to denny's sat at the counter, and finished my full serve meal in the same amount of time it took a bagel sandwich to be made. So disappointed and never again. I'll make my own at home."}
{"text":"I went in recently because there were 2 coupons for free coffee drinks in the ads that come in the mail on Wednesdays. Free - gratis - no purchase required, I noticed they had a complete remodel of the store which is now brighter and more colorful since last I was there 2 years ago. Then at the cashier I noticed a loyatty card that offers 2 more free coffees up front, then if you buy 3 coffees after that until Dec 2011 and get it punched you turn the whole card in for 1 more free coffee."}
{"text":"New, clean, free refills on coffee."}
{"text":"Bagels were good & it was conveniently close to work to get the dozen bucket for the shop. The manager here was a little on the rude side though must not be a morning person! :D"}
{"text":"On feb 2,2017 I bought 2 coffees, cream cheese and bagels to go from your store. 1 bagel was burned on both halves. After spending + $10.00 not going back there."}
{"text":"I love Einstein Bros bagels and schmear but OMG you have to wait forever for everything!! If you're in a rush don't bother, or just grab a bucket of un-toasted assorted bagels and some schmears. They need to change something about how they operate because I've been to EBBs all over the country and they all have the same slow issues. GREAT bagels though if u don't mind the wait."}
{"text":"Everyone was so polite and they were fast too!! After receiving bad service several times at this airport I was impressed with the service and friendliness of the employees.  They have tons of options for food and snacks and they taste great!"}
{"text":"Staff (besides assistant manager) is completely incompetent. The last few times I've been there, I have waited an absurd amount of time either to pay for my food, or receive my food. Not because there was a long line, just because the person who was supposed to do it was distracted doing something else. One time the cashier took a 5 min long phone order instead of helping me (which would've taken 30 seconds), dropped the phone, then started doing drink orders! Never even came back to the register or apologized for the wait. I could've ran out with my bagel without paying!  There are some serious communication issues at that store, and the staff needs some serious re-training. Plus it's safe to say I'm never coming back here again. Which is a shame, because it is so much closer to my house, and I love their bagels. Get it together!"}
{"text":"Seriously get it together people. I was so disappointed with the service here. The guy behind the counter was a complete jerk. Then one of the customers before me order a bagel with salmon on it and the kid behind the counter cam out to tell him that nothing was prepped and it was going to take 10 mins for his bagel.  That's fine but can't u just slap some cream cheese on my bagel so we can keep the food comming out? If I wanted to wait 20 mins for food I would have gone to a restaurant. This location need some serious training and team work to pull this place together"}
{"text":"Had 2 Sesame Seed Bagels Toasted with light Cream Cheese.
They were good. The service is fast and the place was clean.
But I think the price was too much. Over $6.50 for 2 Bagels with Cream Cheese.
This location has a lot of customer that sit around and hang out.
Maybe that is the problem.... others don't stop because there are others living there."}
{"text":"OMG no bagels in display case then I go to get coffee and no coffee. Coffee area was very dirty and to finish off my experience they gave my three item order to another Jim who only ordered one bagel. He took my large. Af of food and left. Next time will look at Yelp before coming to a business."}
{"text":"What a difference a fresh egg makes! Our family stopped for breakfast on our road trip - you are such delightful surprise. My 12 year old son said, \" So much better than Starbucks!\" We all enjoyed our healthy and delicious breakfast bagel sandwiches."}
{"text":"Bagels still alright here, but service has taken a turn for the worse.

Slow, inattentive, and unfriendly. All I wanted was to pay for my food! Instead, fifteen others and I were joined in a line that spent forever being served by nonexistent cashiers.

C'mon now."}
{"text":"This place is always busy and if you come to late in the day you may find that the bagel selection is... well, it might suck my after the lunch rush.  The food is good and the manager is friendly.... but I'm always a little disappointed in how often I see the employees talking among themselves instead of getting the orders out.  I also don't like to see how messy the floor is behind the counter- they could use some extra umph in the cleaning department to keep things looking sanitary.  The bagel crumbs and crumpled napkins that often litter the floor behind the counter is a definite turn off."}
{"text":"This morning my boyfriend and I came here to get some good beagle breakfast sandwich which they where good but my reason for giving you a two star is because I didn't like how one of your staff members was rude to a customer(yes I know why does it matter to me) well it matters because if she was rude to that customers what makes you think she won't be rude to others or me on my next visit(that's still up in the air) but your employee rudely gave the customer her order and when the customer asked her if she can have her drink the employee rudely gave her a cup and walked away rolling her eyes. The customer brought it to the managers attention and that same employee apologized (Fake Apology)to the customer but when the employee walked away to continue with her work she rolled her eyes again and made a face. Like really lol wow if you as an employee going to be rude or roll your eyes after you did your fake apology then I suggest you work in the back of the store."}
{"text":"Every time I come into this location for lunch, they have barely any selection of bagels. Everything is my absolute favorite and it's rare they have it. As someone whose family owned a bagel restaurant growing up, if flavors are that popular, keep baking them, don't let them sell out (especially for the lunch crowd). 

PS - to the female employee working today's lunch shift, I don't care if you think everything flavor is \"nasty\". If I'm coming in specifically asking for it, it's because I like it."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch had an Italian chicken paninni and my friend had the spinach artichoke bagel ,its very expensive the food was microwave  and the employees were like robots"}
{"text":"Worst EINSTEINS ever. I I could give zero stars I would. They never have bagels and the staff is always so rude. It's amazing to me.... I always love EINSTEINS, but this one is a different breed. Something needs to be done about his store ASAP."}
{"text":"I have been into this location multiple times. I usually come in on my way to work to buy bagels for my team. My usual is: a dozen bagels (sliced), 3 cream cheeses and a mocha. Today was no different, except I ordered a Chocolate Chip Coffee Cake as well. I stood in the order line. As I was being served, about 3 other families came in behind me. I told the blonde associate (using hair color for point of reference) that I needed a dozen bagels, random and sliced along with a Chocolate Chip Coffee Cake. She said ok, and I moved forward in the line to pick out my cream cheese. I picked out 3 and moved to the register. I looked in my bagel box and noticed the Coffee Cake was not in the box, so I told the young brunette girl at the register that I think the other young blonde girl forgot my coffee cake and also, I would like to order an Iced Mocha as well. She looked at me and then looked at the huge line, and stated, \"Well, youre going to have to go over there and ask her for it, because i work over here and she works over there.\" Ummmm....not the proper way to handle that but ok. I walked over and stood at the beginning of the line, waiting for the young blonde girl to acknowledge that I was standing there to ask a question, no acknowledgement. So, I walked back to the register and the same young brunette girl (still standing there not doing a thing but waiting for me) says, \"What was it you wanted again?\" I tell her, thinking she was going to walk the 10 steps to go grab it for me. Nope, she just put it in the register and stood there. So, then the blonde girl came over to drop off bagels for the customer behind me, I simply state, \"I think im missing my Coffee Cake.\" She states, \"Oh, im so sorry, I knew i was forgetting something.\" I state, \"No big deal. Thank you.\" *She brings it over and apologizes again* The brunette girl then turns to me and says with a snarky tone, \"You have 3 cream cheeses.\" I state, \"Yes, 3\". She then states, \"The dozen only comes with 2!\" I then stated, \"Yes, I know. I would like to purchase 3.\" She then, rudely, tells me the total and I pay and leave without my receipt because she would not give it to me. 

Working in customer service for a MAJOR big box retailer, I understand that people have their days. However, she was rude to begin with and it would have been much easier (with the size of the line) for her to walk over real quick and grab it for me and walk back. She had no personality and there was no engagement other than attitude. I would expect more from such a well-known food establishment."}
{"text":"I realize I'm in the minority these days, but I still like pumpernickel, and I can almost always count on Einstein Bros having at least one pumpernickel bagel (out of the probably 6 they bake each day) - that with some honey almond schmear and your morning is off to a good start."}
{"text":"I ordered a pumpernickel bagel, a turkey bat, and a large drink. I think the crewmember mistaken the order by turning the pumpernickel bagel into a sandwich. I left the store (without looking into the bag)  and went home. I took out the items from the bag and noticed the pumpernickel was missing. 

I left my house and drove back to the store. The crew was hesitant to talk to me about my problem. I had to flag someone down to talk to me. I explained my issue to the crewmember and he told me they had just sold out of pumpernickel. I called my wife to ask what other bagel she would like. She told me poppy seed. I looked up to tell the crewmember I wanted poppyseed but he vanished. I think he ran off to the back of the store and didn't want to deal with me anymore. 

I talked to a different crew member and explained what happen again! But this time he was going to charge me for another bagel that I didn't get! Then, the girl in the red shirt overheard what happened and gave me the bagel without charge. Then I left the store..."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots to stop and get a quick bite for breakfast. 

Great menu options of all kinds. Whether you have a sweet tooth or like a more savory breakfast option, it's all there. My favorite is the wakin bakin sandwich with one egg. Just enough to fill me up. You also can't go wrong with any of their bagels. Coffee is great too with lots of options for different flavors.

Service is always quick!"}
{"text":"Poor service and there was a fly buzzing around in the display case that housed the bagels."}
{"text":"Wow!!! The first person that greeted us was very unfriendly and did not even crack a smile. Poor customer service...put her in the back where customers cannot see her, not as the first person to greet them!!! The wait was long and my bagel sandwich was burned. Seemed ill prepared. This is in a hotel with large conference groups...better be more prepared and HAPPY you have that many customers. Very disappointed as we really love EB."}
{"text":"Stepped into this place and i get the immediate feeling that they did not want to serve us. Took our order, never asked if we wanted to go or not, the person taking the orders did not even bother to ask for my name. The guy shorting out the order and then said you are welcome before i said Thank you or anything. That is rude! Of the 3 service people there only one person greeted customers."}
{"text":"Terrible customer services I was here with a friend we look completely different I'm 21 and he 27 the lady literally took his order and walked away to the other side of the counter to take someone else's order who wasn't even in line I don't know if this was an act of racism or what but I don't recommend this place if ur black"}
{"text":"This store is chilled/cold. The staff love they jobs. Food is muah!"}
{"text":"Their blueberry smoothie is soooo good! And so is their everything bagel and cream cheese plus they have tasty spreads and great lunch bagels like tuna and such. 

Their chai was good too and I'm picky! 

The staff was crazy friendly and bought my first meal there which was really nice! I just got a bagel and a smoothie but it kept me comin back everyday!"}
{"text":"Craving for best bagel of all time, einstein bagel is the bomb!!!! Fresh bagels, mouth-watering cinnamon sugar is my favorite & a smear of honey almond spread. Service is excellent especially Wendy on a Saturday morning of 4th of July."}
{"text":"We had a craving for bagels and stopped by pretty late in the day (just after 1) for a dozen and some cream cheese. The sesame seed ones are my favorite. The selection was a little low but they  were yummy. The place was dead so the young man behind the customer only had to worry about us and delivered excellent service. We were in and out of there with our dozen sliced bagels in under 5 minutes.

This is out local Einsteins so we have been here many times before without problems. I see that many people complain about the service but I have never had any problems here. I may have to wait a bit when I come in at my usual time around 8 on a weekend but it's usually packed as well so that is to be expected."}
{"text":"Bagels are pretty good a little pricey but it's not like there's another bagels shop in the area A+ on creativity of food"}
{"text":"Amazing bagels. The asigo bagel bites we're amazing!!! Fast service and very fresh bagels."}
{"text":"Love Einstein Bros bagels, but this Summerlin cafe is the pit.  Service was definitely sub-par, treated like an insignificant cog in a machine.  Place is too small for the volume of business.  Coffee not fresh, the house blend not stocked and ready, bagel sandwiches not toasted as requested, no salsa for the southwest Turkey sandwich, and list goes on.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"First time at Einstein. Got breakfast at 10 AM on a Thursday and there were four other customers. 

I got a One-egg Cheesy Mac Breakfast for $6.18. Kinda high for a bagel but we will see. 

It arrived six mins later. The bagel was covered in elbow pasta and cheese.  The filling consisted of an egg, three half-strips of bacon and cheddar. Overall it was a weird breakfast sandwich and I doubt I would order it again. I don't think the value was there for such a thin bagel."}
{"text":"I went here this morning to pick up some coffee and bagels for my family and I. They were very helpful and courteous. There was a confusion on my order but it was my fault. It was easily fixed and I really appreciated the excellent customer service. Everything was neatly packaged and cups, utensils were in the bag without me asking. 

I went around 8am and the place was packed so that should say something! I'm a Starbucks snob but I'll definitely reconsider my coffee choices!"}
{"text":"Some weirdo at the registry... or perhaps I'm too picky... but who throws change in a hand? And drops it..  lol.. he spoke sporadically and arrhythmically wished to have a good day... once realized he failed  :))))


 They placed toasted bagels on the side and didn't even let me know I've been waiting for over 20 minutes.. still the weird guy at the register has a negative energy.."}
{"text":"Love this place and its right around the corner from me.

fresh bagels, attentive staff and fair prices."}
{"text":"The reason they get 2 instead of 1 stars is because the cashier and workers were moderately efficient and extremely friendly, BUT HOLY HELL THESE ARE THE WORST BAGELS I'VE EVER TRIED.  Granted, I'm from the East coast and I've had NYC bagels, so my palate is a little spoiled when it comes to bagels, but still...  I ordered a blueberry bagel with cream cheese and I got circular blueberry toast with cream cheese.  It was good toast, but I didn't pay for TOAST.  Never going back, not even if there's a fire."}
{"text":"Finally! Einstein's has always been my go to for bagels, their tried and true!

I am so happy to have one so close to me, in California their very spread out and I'd only be able to enjoy it when I was in Westminster! Now it's less than 10 minutes from me! My mom has had bagels from 3 places around the area since we've moved here: Winchell's, Dunkin Donuts and Brooklyn Bagels and she's been nothing but disappointed! I knew I was going to be satisfied at Einsteins!

Even though we came late (around closing time) they still had what we wanted and that's ALL that mattered! Their cream cheese is just pure crack! For as long as I've been eating Noah's/Einsteins its always been consistent and delicious! I'm always a fan of you Einsteins!

Good bagels, good service, I'm content!

{"text":"The bagels are very average. Not horrid but now thing crave worthy either. Buying them at a grocery store is as good or better. Not worth the price to us."}
{"text":"Came to pick up some bagels and coffee. While in line I heard a female employee say \"I don't give a shit\" after she saw people in line and KNEW they could hear her and the cashier laughed. Went to pay and ordered my coffee and the stoner looking cashier made my drink wrong after I even double checked with him. I hope the owner knows about his staff making bad impressions on people. Won't be back to shea location"}
{"text":"Oh man! I love this place! Everything they have is great their coffee is amazing and the service is great too! My favorite is the breakfast sandwiches but they also have great salads and I love their orange juice!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever and the food frankly isn't worth the wait. Barely any cream cheese and the bagels are hard as a rock. Same your time and money and skip this place."}
{"text":"I love Einstein's coffees and while their bagels taste delicious, I have noticed they're getting smaller and smaller. I took a photo for documentation. I have small hands and they're about 3/5 the size a regular bagel should be."}
{"text":"Nicest cashier on the planet!! He was so kind and friendly with EVERY, SINGLE person. What an awesome dude."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for breakfast on my commute.  Ordered a bagel sandwich and tea.  Both were just ok. Customer service was good and staff was friendly.  Line moved very quickly as well."}
{"text":"First time coming here and I was in love with there garlic bagel with cream cheese, I also tried there onion bagel with smoke salmon, onion with capers and it was delicious! Can't wait to try there lunch items Hope they bring a lot of these to California"}
{"text":"The morning we had to face the \"horrors\" of the LVDMV, we decided to face our ordeal with a good breakfast in our stomachs, (which meant NOT eating where we were staying, the Suncoast), and figured it would be best to try and find something in that same neighborhood. Thank GAWD we spotted an Einstein's, after our terrible encounter with \"Bagel Corner.\"

Do I REALLY have to say it to you? If you've been in any of their locations, you KNOW. I had a bacon, egg and cheddar cheese on Spinach Florentine...did you even KNOW they made those??? - so damn good, it needs no salt, no pepper, no salsa...NUTTIN', HONEY.  And a cinnamon raisin with extra honey walnut schmear.  It was all I could do to restrain myself, and NOT cart a box of 13 and two or three schmear tubs back with us to the hotel.

Oh, and a fresh cup of vanilla hazelnut blend to go with.  Good enough to make you WEEP. 

Bagel Corner? I have two words for you:

'Bye, Felicia."}
{"text":"Worst lunch I've ever had & for 10 fricken bucks. They should just stick to making bagels at least in this location only."}
{"text":"This is the slowest einstens bagel ever. I've been here roughly about 6 times and every time it takes 10 minutes plus just for a toasted bagel. I feel the employees there talk to each other more than making customers food. Really don't recommend this location."}
{"text":"We purposely came to this location because the one closer to us had worse reviews and we were not disappointed!! We even came back twice....we're from out of town.  Nice, clean restaurant.  The employees are all super friendly and it was so nice to see such happy faces early in the morning.  The service is quick and the food is perfect.  Nice selection of coffees to choose from, too.  I got the fruit cup both visits and the fruit was fresh and so flavorful.  Thanks Einstein Bros!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible. I have attempted to order  special bagels and they have failed a number of times. I consciously  call at times they  should not be extremely busy. This  is the 2nd time they have not fulfilled my order/request. No more. Taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I always love to come to this location everyday for ambience and of course my fave six cheese bagel today they don't have it they don't have the coffee vanilla and the one who serve is not in a smiling mood  ... So don't know I should have go to the 59th and t bird ... Sigh......"}
{"text":"Come after the morning rush. We were there around 10:15.  Just after we arrived there a line started to form. The staff we friendly (they knew all the names of the regulars) and the food was pretty good.  One tip, don't get the Odwalla juice.  It's pretty expensive for a little thing.  What else is there to say?  They have great bagels and delicious smears.  Highly recommend if it's your turn to bring in the office breakfast."}
{"text":"Manager was great, we were 1st timer at that store, he took care of us and even get us the free coffee that he just put on Yelp.  only thing...they forgot to put in one of our order...my asiago bagel dog...

It's ok, that was the 3rd item we ordered this morning.  we were full anyways.  :-)"}
{"text":"I love Einstein Bagels, but this location gets 1 star for their inefficient service.  This is a breakfast place where people need to head to work.  The staff are very slow moving and there doesn't seem to be a good system to just grab a bagel and go.  I'm sure they lose business...  I often wonder where the owner or manager is each day-no seems in charge.  If you're in a rush, don't stop it...  You'll only leave aggravated!!!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest. Einstein Bros Bagels in Tempe is my typical go-to breakfast spot. I can walk there, it's always full of friendly faces, and it usually produces pretty great, affordable bagels and coffee. What's not to like!? Last week I stopped by for a last minute bagel on my way to work and was extremely disappointed by the service I experienced. I ordered my usual egg white and cheddar sandwich on an \"everything\" bagel to go. I paid, took a seat, and waited while my order was completed on a busy Friday morning. I watched the bagel-guru slice my bagel, stick it through the toaster, and promptly drop it on the ground. After some swearing under her breath I sat back and patiently continued to wait...I wasn't in a huge hurry. She put a new bagel in the toaster and I watched as after 10 seconds or so...it ignited in flames! I saw her whack it a few times to put the fire out, and saw her put in a new bagel. 

Unfortunately when I got to work and unwrapped my long-awaited breakfast, I discovered that the bagel-burner had assembled my sandwich on the victim of the toaster fire. The sandwich was charred, crispy, and tasted like I had taken a spoon to what was left of a campfire after a night of s'mores. 

Overall, Einstein's produces good food fairly quickly and for a good price...but lately I've had some not-so-positive experiences. I am a sucker for service, and you can bet I'll be letting another neighborhood bagel joint make my breakfast from here on out."}
{"text":"Not bad at all, I grabbed a coffee and bagel. My bagel was toasted just right, not too crunchy or soft.  The price was okay for airport food and the customer service same."}
{"text":"Great place to get a bagel, their pastries look great. There coffee is good as well. Their service is quick as well."}
{"text":"Most of the staff was friendly, but I got tired of the one worker bitching about why she didn't like working there anymore. She was using a ton of profanities and generally seemed like she didn't like her job, maybe if she took better care of the store and her costumers she wouldn't hate it so much.  Many, Many F words and tell the other worker how much it sucked working here. She is the one in the red shirt I attached, Along with her constant bitching was the other employee sleeping in the corner, real class act Einstein....If she hates working here so much maybe she should just shut her mouth and quit....... she didn't shut up the entire time I was there."}
{"text":"The African American lady behind the counter is very unfriendly, we said thank you she just dropped our food and walked away, same with another gentleman at the counter she didn't acknowledge his thank you either. I only gave two stars because the cashier, a young gentleman was very friendly and nice to all the customers"}
{"text":"I would give negative stars but I can't. I used to work here when I was in high school so I know how it works! First of all the Manger- I asked him for a drink he walked away took someone's order then asked me to move so he could cash that person out. Ok fine no big deal BUT he did it twice!!!! Second of all he was never to be seen after he rudely gave me my drink cup! Third! The two girls working there were awful. Now I understand they could have had a bad day that's fine BUT! First off- they were on their phones the entire time. Second- they had their phones INSIDE THE bagel case. That's disgusting and not sanitary. Third- when I went back to order another bagel they were so rude one of them threw my change at me!!! And then the other tossed my food on the table and very rude said enjoy! Listen I'm in the food industry even if your having a terrible day you brush it off and put a damn smile on your face!! Don't make your guests feel like they are bothering you! We are the reason YOU GET A PAYCHECK!!!! I have never in my life been so disappointed and disrespected! Plus the place is a mess!! I nor my family will be going back there. When I told the manager about the girls he brushed it off as if he didn't care!! Ugh never again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for morning bagels. The service was fairly quick. It just got a bit annoying when the cashier kept calling me \"sweetie\". I asked for my bagels to be precut. Although when got home, they were terribly cut. I cant complain though. In and out very quickly!"}
{"text":"Einstein's is one of the only decent-ish places to get a bagel here...although they really aren't quite bagels (having enjoyed many a NY bagel in my day).

This particular location is so hit or miss. Sometimes, like this morning, they are on top of it, friendly, and provide great service. Other times, I've been served the wrong item, had untoasted bagels, half servings of cream cheese, and ridiculous lines.

I think 2.49 is a little high for a bagel and schmear, but luckily, they have plenty of coupons to make it worth while.  Will I come back? Yes, but only because there aren't really a lot of other options in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"The Southwest Chile Egg White Bagel is the BOMB! Was recommended that by their manager Kim today, and I must say, it made my morning. I literally went back for a second one it was so good. Good call Kim!"}
{"text":"I like Einstein's a lot and the outdoor seating is nice.  I have eaten here quite a few times.  Every once in a while the order gets messed up, but it is always corrected.  No major complaints!"}
{"text":"Came in today to talk about being given the wrong order previously.  This lady behind the counter, Maria helped me out and was very understanding and fixed my order.  Good customer service."}
{"text":"I love to eat here! I get lunch here a lot. I like their chicken salad sandwiches and asiago cheese bagels with garden veggie cream cheese. They should keep it opened an hour longer, though. I know bakeries are all into fresh foods, but it closes before most get to eat dinner."}
{"text":"Worst bagels ever period. Safeway makes this place looks silly. Ordered Lox and toasted bagel. Eating part of a wooden chair has more taste than both lox and bagel!"}
{"text":"Was going to give them no stars but the two gentlemen working today's morning shift were extremely nice. They were both hurrying to get the orders out and apologizing to people for the wait. Now the girl.... she's the reason they would've gotten 1 star, she was rude and it was obvious she didn't want to be there. That's not how customers want to start their mornings. Also, don't ever deny a customers request just because you're on break,  get out from behind on the counter if you're on break then."}
{"text":"Worst Einstein's ever. 
Ordered simple sandwiches off their menu, nothing customized. Both my fiancé and mine sandwiches are wrong. 
How does a company mess up on their own sandwiches. 

The manager was more preoccupied talking to her employee about their night before than making our food and now it came out wrong. 

Don't recommend this location at all."}
{"text":"Bagels are good. Waited about 5 minutes before they started my cappuccino. 10 minutes after that when it was still an empty cup I told them nevermind and left. This location seems to do an ok job with 3 or fewer people in line. The one at Desert Ridge does better with rushes ."}
{"text":"Nice people; terrible food. As bad as Dunkin, Donuts, which is pretty terrible if you have \"Bagel\" in your name. Everything comes off a truck and those nice kids zap it to your table in a minute. Bagels have no texture to speak of; cookies taste like vending machines. Ask for an iced chai latte and receive a cup of ice with a diabetes-causing level of sugary tan liquid sprayed on top of it. Dining room designed by irate toys \"r\" us employees. For fervent Trump supporters only."}
{"text":"20 minutes to get two bagels with plain cream cheese and then they get the order wrong and put on chive cream cheese. 

Then upon returning the bagel that I had touched they gave it to somebody else"}
{"text":"Awesome staff! Always so friendly! Love coming here just to see them and of course the bagels!"}
{"text":"So glad I took the time to order this bagel as \"lightly toasted\" -this happens all the time, and not *just* at this location. Please address this.  :( left the parking lot already when I noticed it didn't taste right..."}
{"text":"This location is pretty terrible. I had time to kill yesterday so after my Starbucks run (right next door) I stopped here and decided to get some breakfast. It wasn't terribly busy, but there was a pretty decent number of people there for 8:30am on a Wednesday. I went to the first person, put in my order, then walked down to the next person who read off my order and it was completely incorrect. When I told her it was incorrect, she rolled her eyes and started huffing & puffing (this was after the same thing happened with the couple in front of me as well). She said she had to get a manager in order to fix the order, but I told her to just leave the order as is because I didn't wanna back up the line. After paying, I stood there for about 15 min waiting for my breakfast bagel. If you ask me, that's a bit long. Needless to say, the communication between the employees at this location is absolutely terrible. They're all running around like chickens with their heads cut off, but none of them actually seem to be doing anything. The owner & managers really need to get it together and make this place run more efficiently."}
{"text":"We like the idea of this place, and have never been to a different EinsteinBros location, but this particular spot doesn't do very well. We find the employees are unmotivated young folks (we are only in our 30's) that don't enjoy their job and take no pride in anything done. The location isn't very clean and is often out of very standard items. We keep coming back every few months since its in a convenient spot, but it always disappoints. This spot needs new management to breathe some life into it. Unless you have to have a bagel, eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Honestly I'm not the type of person to write a review about bad customer service, because it is actually really hard to go somewhere and have amazing service! But today when I came I was the first in line and a gentlemen held the door open for me and 2 others. So by then there was 4 customers waiting. The person who was suppose to take my order never welcomed me but continued talking with his coworker for a minute very loudly about how horrible there manager is.. this went on and on then he looked at me and said one second and finished packing an order a previous customer was waiting on. He finally took my order and I went to pay at the next register and the girl there seemed like she was lost in space. It was just a really awkward interaction! 

I finally paid and was waiting for my food which took longer then normal. Once I got my food that was taken to go I double checked it and the employee said to me \"don't worry I know I did it right\" 

My food was good, but the service there I will not be going back. I normally go to the one on eastern and serene."}
{"text":"This has become my corner bagel shop, have always been a fan of Einsteins and this location is on point every time. Extra special shoutout to Richard for making us feel special every time. Customer service is innate for him an we appreciate him going above and beyond!!"}
{"text":"Today was the second time I visited this location and both times, the same lady was vacuuming during open hours. The first time she vacuumed super close to our table. And if you vacuum, you know that the sound can get awfully loud. Today, she asked me to wait so she could finish her vacuuming. I didn't know that business values choose to place vacuuming as a top priority over customer service, but I guess it does here! If you looking for a place where you can hear a loud, obnoxious sound of a vacuum as you eat your bagel, this is the place to be! I guess vacuum white noise is really a thing?

And the vacuum is not the worst part, the manager accused me of stealing an orange juice from the shelf! I had purchased a Starbucks drink and placed it on the table before walking myself to the counter to purchase my bagel. When I ordered, I handed the manager a coupon that I had and he asked me if that was all I wanted to order. I said yes. He proceeded to accuse me of not paying for the orange juice I had on the table. I told him it wasn't an orange juice and that it was a Starbucks drink. Some could argue that I shouldn't have brought my drink into the store, but no where did I see a sign for \"no outside drinks or food\" on the door or walls. He did NOT apologize for the choice of words that he used to accuse me with and went on to accept my money. I eventually got a refund because they were out of the bagel that I wanted, but this business is definitely not going to thrive with the level of abysmal customer service values and attitude towards their patrons. I definitely will not be returning and you should not too."}
{"text":"Advertised a free $5 gift card with the purchase of a $20 card.  When I arrived today of course they are out of $5 cards.  Bait and switch!"}
{"text":"I candidly do not like writing a bad review. I believe most of my posts on Yelp over the years have been positive in nature. That said, my experience this morning at this location was less than satisfactory. I'm not happy. From the moment I walked in I was treated disrespectfully and the staff was less than friendly. Simple questions as \"what's included in the package\" were answered with what I thought were rude comments. It wasn't a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"I sometimes pick up bagels for the folks at work, usually on Fridays. This Einstein's location is always fast, efficient and clean. The staff are very friendly and take the time to go the extra mile."}
{"text":"I love Einstein Bros. They are located right outside of TSA checkpoint A gates at Sky Harbor..once you get in thru security.. good luck finding anything half way healthy.. SO its this or its Paradise Bakery.. which I get bored with..Einstein has tasty bagels and schmear..but also a lighter version of sammys. I like the turkey lightened sammy. I get it often and I love it. The bagel is more like half the size. AND I think it's delish! The people here are friendly. Its airport pricing.. the only thing I dislike."}
{"text":"I went to this Einstein's two days in a row since it's right near my apartment. Unfortunately I would have to sum up my experience as crappy both times. For a bacon egg and cream cheese sandwich to be priced at $9 is utter insanity, especially when the eggs and bacon are sitting in a hotel pan kept on a warmer. There are sit down restaurants you can go to, pay less, and have a fresh egg cooked to order! I might have kept going there and paid the prices for shit food since it's so close to my apartment, but when I politely asked about the prices thinking maybe I was charged incorrectly the first day I got a really bitchy register girl telling me no they just honestly charge $9 for a sandwich that costs maybe $3 at every other bagel establishment. Safe to say I'm not going back there or any other Einstein's for that matter!"}
{"text":"The food is great, the service is terrible!!! In the last two orders we have had they have been messed up. In fact, when we were there today the table next to us had a mess up in their order as well. They also had two people walk out because of how many bagels were out of stock. Then we saw a worker answer her cell phone and go in to the back. If they paid attention to the orders as much as they did their phones they would be an amazing establishment. I will go out of my way now to go to a different location. Such a bummer!"}
{"text":"I have lunch here nearly every Tuesday. The staff are always friendly and Einsteins always has good food. It's a great place to meet people and talk. The patio is great, except in really hot or humid weather, which doesn't happen often (gotta love AZ weather!)."}
{"text":"\"Hello! Welcome!\" \"Good Morning\" \" Thank you\"... No... None of that... Ok then I'll go somewhere else.. Seriously if you don't feel like working you should probably stay home with your 40 cats. Especially if you're going to be the one taking the orders."}
{"text":"They don't close for 3 hours. Yet they are super slow and hardly have any bagels. There is nobody in line yet it has been close to 10 mins and I still don't have my food!"}
{"text":"Horrible service'!!! I love Einstein as a company but the customer service was not good at all! We went to go grab a bakers dozen for the first time ... Cashier acted like she had no clue.... Upon reading and grabbing two shears we noticed that one of the smears we loved wasn't available so hubby asked if there was any more.. Guy turns around and said yes in the freezer and didn't offer to get us any or get someone ... Upon checking out and paying the girl got our shmear but where was our box of bagels? She went to her co worker who finally got a box then he asks us what we want after waiting a while.... We tell him and in the middle he paused to answer a customers question ..... Delaying our bagels for about 4 mins didn't even apologize for the wait and interruption .. We felt disrespected and did not feel like we were valued as customers ... We then decided we would just grab a variety and just go ... Horrible service and I'm not one to write reviews ... The management needs to change ... They are giving Einstein a bad name"}
{"text":"Went here after I arrived to my hotel with a group of girls and it was actually kinda hard to find. We walked from our hotel (Hilton Resort & Villas) and it was an adventure lol. This place is located in a deep corner from coming on the Trader Joe's side so it's easy to overlook.

Well I ordered the Honey Glazed Smoked Salmon on a Honey Whole Wheat Bagel. It was good. I didn't taste the smoked part or honey, but it was still good. I kinda wish there was more salmon  and cream cheese. It filled me up, but it didn't FILL me up. Which I don't think it was supposed to. I think it was just maybe for a light lunch? I'm not sure. I don't think paying around $8 was worth it, but I could be wrong.

The workers were nice. There was only two of them and about 13 of us so it took some time to get our food. When we left they thanked us for coming."}
{"text":"Best bagels I have ever eaten.  Staff willing to help and very friendly."}
{"text":"Went there this morning in four out of the six coffee urns were empty, all their employees were just standing around and talking. Plus the restaurant needs a lot of cleaning. I definitely will not be back.Plus when I told the girl that the coffee was empty she acted like it really wasn't a big deal."}
{"text":"I was having a total freak-out-fest bitch-fit because I had skipped breakfast and taken medication on an empty stomach on my way to go rock climbing.  I needed to eat something, anything, now!

I saw Einstein Bagels and pulled in.  I had never eaten at any Einstein Bros. before but I was super happy with my decision.  I got a egg and cheese everything bagel.  It hit the spot, the staff was friendly and quick.  Everyone working on Friday morning took care of business and were hustling out food to customers and just getting it done."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and I love the bagels and coffee! The guy taking our order was very nice and funny. Their poppyseed bagels are my favorite. The food didn't take long to make and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Do not go here! The staff is not very friendly, the wait time for food is RIDICULOUS, and the whole establishment looks dated. I've been here multiple times now and have experienced impolite staff and horrible wait times. Will not come again."}
{"text":"I really wasn't a fan of Einstein's, but it's location inside the Hyatt was great. Very convenient for a quick breakfast if you're staying at the hotel. The coffee I had was good, but a few times during our conference, they ran out of coffee in the mornings, probably due to high demand."}
{"text":"Great bagels!
Amazing variety of bagels!!
Try jalapeño bagel with jalapeño salsa for a kick!"}
{"text":"So in a place (at least in this part of the airport) where your starting price for food is $9-10 for something awful, I figured $3 for a bagel with cream cheese wasn't a terrible idea.  Of course their bagel sandwiches start at 8... 

If you can, go to Wendy's, I'm convinced it's the best option in McCarren."}
{"text":"About 9-12 months ago there's been a staffing change at this location, at the management level, and it's taken a dump. The McDowell and Camelback locations staff and management are great, efficient and greet you at the door. This Arcadia location is to busy acting foolish behind the counter, making customers wait for no reason and so unprofessional. I find myself going to Sip and Stevens sandwiches more or driving out of my way to the camelback location."}
{"text":"OUT OF BAGELS AT 7:30 am? And you are a bagel store. 
How does this happen?
Do not be surprised when you go out of business. 

Then we drove to the Eastern avenue location and the same thing, out of bagels at 8 am?Einstein Bagel is not genius at all... Named after a genius
Get you shit together not so smart bagel establishment that ran out of EFFING bagels, WHO BAGEL SHOP RUNS OUT OF BAGELS AT 7:30 am
Errrrrr.


Dec. 29th out of bagels at 12 noon?!!!!
What on earth is your problem?"}
{"text":"We went there about 12:30 today and the sign said they were open until 3. Unfortunately,  between the selections of bagels and how the staff were cleaning the store is thought we were holding them up from closing. A very few choices of bagels,  and when I asked if there were more bagels in the back to choose from the cashier turned her head around to look and the shrugged her shoulders at me. I think the owner needs to reevaluate his Sunday staff."}
{"text":"Convenient location in downtown Phoenix at the Hyatt Regency.  This place is consistently busy with convention traffic and the bagels are always fresh."}
{"text":"We go to Einstein's often but this one had terrible service. We walk in and no one greeted us. Ok. We waited a while for someone to finally help us and when they did, they were very rude. I have been in the customer service industry for a while so I know bad days happen but the whole staff was unfriendly. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Worst Einstein location I've ever been to, and I've been to many.  Guess they feel they have a captive audience and they can operate in whatever fashion they choose.  9:20a on a Saturday and they're sold out of everything but Asiago and Everything bagels.  No plain, no sesame, no cinnamon  raisin.   Nice planning.  Cramped and beat up looking too. Make the drive to Corky and Lenny's."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would. This place is a mess. On top of the fact that the young staff here has no motivation, they also have no direction. No manager on site or at least in plain view, and seemingly no training on how to deal with customers needs. Simple orders confused, restaurant a mess, I had to ask the young man behind the counter to speak up three times and to stand up straight before I can understand what he was saying. We watched how they dealt with a customer that had called in an order and clearly there was some confusion, but they could not decide how to resolve the issue. (No management present) The whole thing was just a shit show.
I think I'll avoid this one next time I go to the one on Scottsdale Road."}
{"text":"Ugh ugh ugh. Watched my bagel sandwich being made, the guy had gloves on, walked away from my bagel, went out to the eating area, cleaned up the areas near the trash cans and picked up baskets that previous patrons had used. Took the stack of baskets back to my bagel and proceeded to handle my bagel and put it in a used basket all with the same gloves. We actually walked out.  The manager followed us and asked if we wanted our bagels, and I explained. To give her credit, she said she has been in the store for two weeks and is aware of multiple problems of this kind and is trying to fix them but that it takes time.  I wished her good luck and we went on our way and found breakfast elsewhere. I feel bad for her - she has her work cut out for her if basic sanitary procedures are not followed."}
{"text":"Einstein bagel never fail on good tasting food. Today I got the spinach bacon bagel and it was delicious. Service is not always there but the food is on point. Good job."}
{"text":"Love this place!  It's definitely a regular on my list of eatery's.  Bagels are delish.  Things I eat here... bacon, egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich on sesame bagel, tasty turkey sandwich, and turkey melt... served open face with turkey, tomato and melted cheese... I usually sub out for swiss cheese.  Tasty tukey is one of my faves!  Turkey with sprouts, cucumber, lettuce, tomato and chive cream cheese spread - sandwiches come with potato chips or potato salad.  Pot salad is very good. All their locations usually have some outdoor seating too!"}
{"text":"Pretty expensive for lunch.

Got 2 bagel sandwiches, a bagel with cream cheese, a bagel with butter, 4 drinks.

They were out of fresh fruit as a side for the sandwiches, the butter for the bagel was old, hard and separated.  It was actually pretty gross tasting as was the fresh brewed iced tea.  It tasted like coffee instead of iced tea.

I can't imagine ever going to this location again."}
{"text":"Been here 6+ times (as its closest to home) and it's always the same.

The service is TERRIBLE. Never a greeting, let alone a friendly one. There is NO customer service here. None. 

Today I watched one of the employees (female, dark hair) interact with about 8 customers without smiling once. Not once. 

They need some serious staff training, this place isn't worth it. Find bagels elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm not usually one to rate an airport fast food place, but damn. Super slow line, and when we got to the front of the line, the only available bagels were sweet flavors. Why are you cooking eggs in that situation? What monster is going to put egg on a blueberry bagel? Make some bagels, fools! The bagels themselves were super stale. Never knew it was possible for a bagel place to be out of plain bagels and plain cream cheese (among a million other things) at 6am."}
{"text":"What in gods Jewish name is the problem with you people and the service of breakfast coming out sooner than later.
\"Mama it's so sad they don't have thintastic bagels any more.\" What is with you people.... 
PLEASE PLEASE GET IT TOGETHER? 
Where is our food?!!!! 
I ORDERED MY FOOD 25 minutes ago!!!


You people are so nice. AND there is always an issue here.



Because you \"no longer have thin bagels\" you have to cut the big ones down! WHAT?
AND then, the deal is, you run out of Everything bagels in the morning, a \"fresh\" batch comes out and the \"bagels are to soft to cut,\" this was the issue with our breakfast this am.

And then you there at Einstein Eastern, you seem to sell out of bagels when we go at least once a week- YOU SELL OUT OF BAGELS BY 9 AM...? WHY? Isn't this poor planning? WHO BREAKFAST BAGEL PLACE SELLS OUT OF BAGELS FOR BREAKFAST? 

This is getting old Einstein Bagels. 
Why do we keep going? 
My 16 year old loves the thintastic egg white, mushroom and asparagus creation you serve... Plus, the service is lovely, minus the lack of food you run out of. 

You are always apologetic and so kind... It's quite amazing. 
Is this pour management when a breakfast establishment runs out of Bagels? WHAT IS IT? 
Is it possible to correct it once and for all?"}
{"text":"I love the food, if only they were better at getting the order right. They consistently prepare orders incorrectly & it becomes frustrating when they get annoyed. They are also frequently out of popular items. At 12, they should have a good stock of bagels for the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Dirty dirty dirty. 1 hour before closing.  2 employees standing around chitchatting.   Every table dirty.  Didn't bother to wipe the one we chose so we brushed the crumbs on the floor.  We were the only customers in the place.  The worst part was the bathroom.  Funky!  Old dirt in every corner.  Old soap filthy piled on the floor and down the wall.  Gas station bathrooms are cleaner.  Disappointing, I visit many of these shops and I have never seen anything like this."}
{"text":"Love Einstein's! Great selection of bagels and also a great selection of cream cheese shmears. You can come in and experiment with all the combinations; different bagels, cream cheeses, get it toasted, not toasted, plain or all spiced up. Folks behind the counter are friendly. Get my order right ..yep.. every. single. time. Want to save money on your coffee while enjoying yummy bagel? Just bring your travel mug for discount price. Not an Einstein's mug? No problem! Heck, you could even bring in your Starbucks mug (from nextdoor) and refill it here for cheap. Deal! Great sitting area outside. Want to walk, jog, or bring the dog here on Saturday? Perfect spot for it. Sitting inside and forgot your newspaper? Everyone shares the 'community' paper around here. I have to give it 5 stars :-) Yup..Every time I venture to a new bagel spot I always come back to Einstein's."}
{"text":"Eh, bagels might be good. Everyone else seems to like their bagels, but the breakfast sandwich was not very good. Lol, stick to the main stuff on the menu. White chocolate mocha iced coffee was trash. I could get a larger and better cup of coffee from Starbucks for same price.."}
{"text":"Love a good bagel every now and then and this place has some of the best IMO.  I am particularly fond of the Tasty Turkey sandwich and all of their spreads are awesome.  Only 4 stars because it has been very busy the few times that I have been there.  The silver lining of that though is that they have to turn over bagels quick so they are usually very fresh"}
{"text":"The WORST Einsteins location Ive been to. Terrible service and had to wait 20-30mins for my coffee (not joking) all (3) times Ive been here. It really wasn't even thatbusy.  This place is horrible! I will absolutely not be returning to this location!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at this location for about eight or nine years now and the service has gone way downhill since there has been this new manager! Every time I place an order it is wrong and when I say there is an issue I get attitude as if I was in the wrong! I was asking a simple question to the young black girl as to how many eggs were on the sandwich and she told me yes! And I simply said how many eggs come on that sandwich and again the answer I received was yes! Then I proceeded to tell her no I'm asking you a question! Then she said OK what's your question? And then after a Nother customer proceeded to the counter to complain about her order being wrong the manager mid 40s black guy shook his head and walked away and said  oh it's going to be one of those mother effing mornings, with a? And I also found a cut a piece of plastic in my fruit and when I went to get a drink from the fountain machine it seems like it has not been cleaned for weeks! There is nasty brown stains dripping from the ice machine! I would definitely say there's a problem with management at this location! It seems that he is hiring all of his get a little family members and just letting them do whatever they want to do! I will definitely not be eating at this establishment until changes have been made in management! The place was filthy and I ordered three different types of food and that seemed that they were out of all of the bagels I was interested in!"}
{"text":"I don't go in very often because the service has always been lousy. TODAY WAS THE WORST! Mother's Day would be the day you would have a ton of staff onhand; not the case.  They had RUN OUT OF ALMOST ALL BAGELS!  We ordered bagels we didn't really want and waited forever to receive them. Apparently the manager was nowhere to be found, and the baker had just walked off the job. (Baker? As in one? How hard is it to make bagels?!) Do yourself a favor: take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I realize that they just opened recently, but they need to really work on organization.  Once they couldn't find the order I phoned in and another time they were so confused that No one was going to ring up my order. I had to flag someone down that was prepareing another order so I could pay. With that said, the Tasty Turkey sandwich is very good but I feel they need to delegate better what each employee is supposed to be doing."}
{"text":"Mannn this place is . Straight fireeee. I always get a farmhouse bagel it's the best! Also their fresh lemonade is to die for"}
{"text":"Customer service is HORRIBLE, they all seem to have an attitude while they are working , like come on its just a bagel no need to be in your feelings. The wait time is ridiculous compared to dunkin donuts or starbucks. The food is good but the employees look like zombies. Worst place to go ever when trying to grab something quick on break from work. They forget who was in line first and seem confused on the \"Order Here\" \" Pay here\" Signs. One girl with blue and purple in her hair with a ponytail today 9/27/16 used the same gloves that she was making sandwiches with to go and answer the phone, absolutely disgusting. This place needs to be closed or revamped. Pay attention to your reviews Einstein's cause they are nothing nice."}
{"text":"Great bagels and pretty well brewed coffee!  The service can be hot or miss sometimes but all in all a good experience."}
{"text":"Got the turkey sausage, cheese and egg on a wheat bagel. Very tasty!!!! Would go back for the bagel sandwich!!! Yummm. Also go the orange juice- yum. Blueberry muffin- it tasted a lot like cake. Too sweet, I didn't think I was eating a muffin which usually isn't as sweet- it was sugar sweet not natural sugar from the blueberry. Wouldn't get that again."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to an Einstein bros in Vegas and I'm not happy.I ordered a tasty turkey bagel.While I was waiting on my food I was watching the guy with long curly hair making all the food and I noticed he has no hair net.so I stood as he grabbed the menu with the gloves on and then the food.If i am not mistaken I think that's not okay.I really wanted to say something but I didn't want to make it a big deal.My food was finally done.And as I was Finally eating I Noticed there was a HAIR IN MY FOOD! I Definitely won't be coming back to this place and I wouldn't recommend it.And Now It's. A Big Deal!"}
{"text":"Bagels are yummy! Food is fast. I even loved the fruit and yogurt so fresh! Yummy coffee"}
{"text":"They had bagels and I needed something to eat early at the airport. Not much to it beyond that. I suppose I like their non-airport retail locations better, but what can you expect from the airport?"}
{"text":"We were checking out College's this summer and had breakfast @ Einstein's. It was really good, Breakfast Bagel w/ Turkey Sausage & the kids got bagels w/ CC plus some of the Cinnamon Twist. The best part is my son joined their Text Club and got his Bagel w/ CC FREE. If my daughter chooses Pitt or Carnegie then we will be back!"}
{"text":"Work nearby and been here a lot over the years. Bagels are great, sandwiches are just so so (could have better meat ingredients, especially for the price) but WOW does the service stink. Last straw - only 1 person behind counter removing bagels from the baking racks. Looked right at me a few times but never said a word to me. Really, guess I'll have to walk a little further cuz that really is the last time I'm going there."}
{"text":"Einstein's is Noah's Bagels in SF

They're the same!
Who knew!?

Anyways,
I like the manager of this location.  He's always so friendly and seems genuinely happy to be there and talkin' with his customers.

I am obsessed with the jalapeno salsa cream cheese.  I literally buy 3 tubs of it everytime I go there.

My favorite items include
Santa Fe bagel sandwich (jalapeno salsa cream cheese, turkey sausage, eggs, pepperjack cheese and salsa! YUM)
Pepperoni pizza bagel

AND.  They have Mr Pibb on tap.  I love Mr. Pibb.  Don't know why, I just do."}
{"text":"When the people who work at a restaurant start to remember your name, that's a good thing, right? We love coming to this Einstein Bros Bagels because the service is pretty quick, the workers are nice, there's plenty of parking, it's clean, and somewhat close to home."}
{"text":"Super busy on Saturday morning, but worth the wait...the bagels were fresh and delicious!  Sit on the patio at Camelback instead of at the main entrance on the back side...more space to spread out!  Very friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Hard to review a bagel place......As good as it gets. The staff is uber quick here and friendly. Power bagel and strawberry cream cheese.......LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food, 5 stars! Bagels = happiness. But every time I come it's extremely busy, which is excellent! And it's not the busyness that upsets me, it's the service! The line is out the door almost always and I wait 10-15 minutes before I even order, again not a problem, but I get up to the order station and the lady goes \"it's going to be a 15 minute wait for your food\". Me: Ok....thanks!? How about a \"good morning thanks for your patience, it's about 15 minutes for Your food just so you know, I hope that's ok?\" Or something along those lines. Like I already waited, I'm more than happy to wait for my food, I came here for a reason, I know there's a wait! Ugh! It's just frustrating. You're a yummy breakfast place, you're going to be busy at breakfast time, put a damn smile on your face and be ready for the rush! If you don't like fast paced, go work in a shitty hole in the wall!"}
{"text":"I've only been cursed enough to stop in at this location 3 times and each time their bagels have been burnt/over done. Their customer service is sub par and their manger acts like he's in the hood. Also, AC is on full blast. Everyone on there was freezing"}
{"text":"Today you guys were out of 70% of your types of bagels at 9:15am. When I said to the cashier \"gosh I wish you guys were not out of so much!\" She said back to me \" if your going to be picky about what kind of bagel you want you should call ahead\" don't think I need to say more...."}
{"text":"Great fresh made bagel joint. Make sure to get there either 7, or 9:30 for freahest batches. Asiago is the BOMB!"}
{"text":"The surliest place on earth. Never have I felt so reviled, hated, ignored and loathed as I was by the counter help both in the morning and afternoon of 4/25/17. We were in this hotel for a conference. They were passive aggressive, rude, spent as much time with backs to us as they could, pointedly ignoring us.

In the morning, they left us standing at one register where we had seen another couple ordering and stepped away as we stepped up, helping customer after customer at the other register as a long line formed there and ignoring us when we tried to get their attention. When we finally were able to get into that line, when it was our turn to order--a latte and a yogurt parfait--she didn't make eye contact, just angrily rang up our our order. 

In the afternoon, after having lunch at another busy eatery where the help were pleasant to us, we returned. This time, the store was nearly empty. Different counter person. Same surly angry attitude, ignoring us until we finally walked away. Fatigue was more welcoming."}
{"text":"Always good. Egg & ham, egg & bacon. All the bagel flavors are fresh and taste delicious. Coffee good too. On the down side. New employees every time I go in and sometimes service is not great. I go because I like the bagels."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. They \"got too busy\" at the store to work on a catering delivery order I placed the day before. And decided to just not show up to the 25 person meeting I had arranged to have food delivery to. Unacceptable.

Update: The Director of Catering reached out and apologized for the inconvenience - crediting back 50% of the order that was over 70 mins late. I appreciate the gesture and hope the staff uses this as a learning opportunity with respect to customer service."}
{"text":"Salmon on a bagel? Whose idea was that!? Whoever it was, was/is a genius because I'm a sucker for lox bagels and einsteins has a pretty good one! Plus their diverse selection of bagels and cream cheese make me want to sample them all. I'm looking at you pumpkin bagel with honey almond cream cheese. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was quick - but all I had ordered was a sesame bagel with cream cheese. So I should be quick.  All I will say is that they barely put any cream cheese on the bagel!! I had to pull the bagel apart just to see they remembered to put it on!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about. The staff at this location are friendly to me. The service is fairly quick as I've gone in at varying times throughout the day. I love the everything bagel with veggie cream cheese. The steak, egg, and cheese bagel was a huge disappointment. It was pretty bland and tasteless. Stick with the bagels and cream cheese. As for the customer who waited 20 minutes for a bagel, I don't have the patience to wait that long for a snack."}
{"text":"I went in today and ordered a simple ham and Swiss sandwich .... the menu states it has ham cheese lettuce tomatoe and is a cold sandwich. I also ordered a toasted bagel with butter. Instead I got a hot ham and egg sandwich and a cold bagel with so much butter my friend had to scape it off...  ?!!! I even asked to spread the butter lightly since they typically smear way too much Creme cheese.. and they still got it wrong. The place needed sweeping and very unkept... not happy as now I have no lunch... what happened to people listening...  this is the 2nd time I've been here that they have totally messed up my food... I blew the first visit off as well they were busy.. this time not busy!!!! This location needs improvement."}
{"text":"If only I could give them a negative star...they were out of plain bagels. Really? How are you out? You cant manage bagels? When you're out there should be some being taken out of the oven fresh. Common sense. But they guy told me 8 minutes. So I waited. 5 minutes later he tells me sorry it's going to be another 8 minutes! Every time I come here they're out of bagels. Called the Einstein on Gilbert, she said were out of plain too lol F this place. But ya'll want $15/hr right...idiots should be getting $8"}
{"text":"Can't stop going here!! Every Sunday- Bagel with Lox.. LOVE LOVE LOVE.. I'm addicted"}
{"text":"Seems like a newer location, having a drive through is a plus but with less than 5 mins wait time on a busy morning is a bonus. Food quality is always consistent and staff is well trained! Have been to too many locations nationwide, but this location is simply the best!!"}
{"text":"Service was okay. Food was decent. We ordered the bagel with cheese and hash brown along with egg + cheese. It was good but I wish I had ketchup!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the delightfully perky, kind and quick service! Foods was served as expected and the place was tidy."}
{"text":"This store is the Worst! The lack of efficient help and managing their time. I can't believe I waited for a toasted bagel and a smear on the side for more than 20 mins. I can understand when they're busy, you have to wait. But when you see the employees calling up customers and Not handing out their orders cuz of some problems. That's way too much! I allowed myself plenty of time to stop by and pick up a quick order. Never again!  And! Management if you say your open til a certain time! DON'T close earlier than the time in the window says!!"}
{"text":"For my money, probably the best hazelnut coffee of all the chain coffee shops. And the bagels and \"schmear\" will always make your stomach smile. Interior is huge and relatively quiet. A bit of walk for those without cars, but still a worthy stop during your study/work routine."}
{"text":"I frequent this place about once a week when I just need a quick snack. They have lots of options to choose from and the bagels are always fresh. The staff is also super friendly :)"}
{"text":"Got out of my car to go to Fed Ex but the smell of bacon made me whip my head around to see where it was coming from. Since it was only 8:30 in the morning on a tuesday I thought breakfast was calling out to me. People do say its the most important meal of the day. I guess my package can wait. Priorities right? Bacon usually takes it over almost anything.

So I go in and am shocked to discover the place was packed. I guess people do eat breakfast eh? Anyways, as I took a quick glance on their menu, I noticed the only thing that had bacon in it was the Spinach, Egg, and Bacon Panini. So, that's my order. It cost me about 6 bucks and some change. I was thinking wow, that is a bit pricey for a panini.

Waited about 10 minutes. When I got it, the sandwich was about the size of an Earl's sandwich, about 6 inches. Basically it was two small sandwiches put together. You had scramble eggs mixed with spinach and some bacon. It was ok but for the price and portion size, not worth it. Maybe I should of stuck to bagels. LOL.

In closing, I think next time I will just get a bagel or two and put some shmear on it. Weird name for their spreads but oh well, its pretty good.

{"text":"Unfortunately for my waistline, this location is conveniently located on my way to work. The workers are friendly and efficient, prices are what you'd expect. The bagels.... SO GOOD! I haven't tried a schmear I didn't like...but I can tell you the jalapeno salsa is amazeballs. Especially on the green chile bagel. Holy hotness! Love it! They also have iced coffee priced less than their competitors and I love the vanilla hazelnut!"}
{"text":"This location is convenient for lunch and I've always had a pleasant experience. The workers are friendly and efficient, prices are what you'd expect. The bagels.... SO GOOD!

If you come for lunch, you can add a side of cream cheese and change the bread/bagel your sandwich comes on at no charge which is a huge perk."}
{"text":"I come here every so often to pick up lunch. I always get the same thing everytime... Turkey Bagel Thin and a Large Iced Tea. I like the yummy spread they put in the sandwich and the fruity tea they have available at the beverage station. I haven't had a problem with service being slow; my sandwich is usually ready by the time I'm done filling up my tea. But then again, I always go in around 11am."}
{"text":"Cinnamon twists and chocolate hazelnut pastries are my fave! Always fresh and fluffy."}
{"text":"This location used to be good! Now it's worthless! As a chef, I watch everything! Including sanitation practices. I watched an employee yesterday, make several bagels after tucking his shirt into his pants. He never once changed his gloves or washed his hands. He just kept making bagels and filling orders. The sad part is that he must be the assistant manager and was in a maroon colored button up shirt. I also witnessed several other employees playing behind the line and yelling at each other because orders weren't being done. 

My wife and I love the products but, let's face it it's a bagel shop. I could easily run the place properly without the long wait times. The staff is unorganized and very sloppy! The floors were disgusting as I watched the stay step over fallen bagels, trash, and paper. I really hope this place gets the health department called on them. Also, when the have a large line the quality of the product really suffers and it's a shame. Again, this is a bagel shop... Not fine dining, or any other place where the work is tough! 

I give them one star! I do so for their consistent disappointment! Clean the place up and get back to the basics!!"}
{"text":"I just can't seem to get over the horrible wifi. I work fairly close to this joint, so I like to hit it up for lunch when I need to access the internet. You'd have better luck with some dial up internet. WOW! I even told the shift leader about the issue and his reply was, \"Yeah I'm not surprised.\" LIsten Einsteins, your food is delicious and a bit overpriced. But you specialize in bagels and coffee. Wifi is a MUST."}
{"text":"Just a bad place 
\"Good morning \" none of the ppl that work there Heard about this 
\"Thank you \" a smile 
Hello 
SOMETHING 
god who run this place 
Why they don't teach them to care about there customers 
And the food ??? Really ??? They take the bags the put cream cheese tomato ( to make it look high and full ) and on top \"salmon \" lol no there is no salmon there just a wired place 
Stay away for real"}
{"text":"They get a two for being open crazy early (5:00am) when I need breakfast on the way to work. 

But at that hour the staff always has music to their taste playing loud enough in the house to be heard on the back. The woman at the counter screamed three greetings to me as I approached the counter, none of which I could hear over the pop song on loudspeaker.  Had to yell my order to be understood. Then had to wait getting a headache from the loud music while the counter help screeched three times for a cashier as she threw my order together so sloppily it was totally unappealing. Not a pleasant experience at all."}
{"text":"This should be a four- or five-star place. But the service brings it down. The bagels are excellent, and there's nothing wrong with the food. But the staff leaves the coffee too long - it always tastes burnt / bitter / terrible (just go next door and get a Starbucks). They also take no interest in the cleanliness of the place - I have never seen someone come out and wipe down tables or sweep up debris. Staff turnover is high and competence is low; they tend to have an attitude."}
{"text":"This placed failed today. It took forever to get my food. As I waited, the patron in front of me complsined about the fact that her 2 fozen bagels for carrout took forever. In the end, that order was screwed up. When my sandwich was done, it was on the wrong type of bagel. By the time I got my food corrected...the line was out the door. And prople after me were having all sorts of issues with their orders. 

I hope this place pulls their heads out of their rear-ends before they get themselves put on the nasty list!

And to the young lady at the register...don't roll your eyes at customers! You know who you are...green t-shirt"}
{"text":"BEWARE THE EXPENSIVE, UNWARRANTED UPCHARGE--NOT WORTH IT!

Back in my college days, I would frequent Einstein Bros often. Inexpensive food when you're on the go. On my way to work this morning, I decided to revisit my once-frequented bagel go-to. At first I was glad to see their \"Healthy Options\" menu, featuring the asparagus mushroom and swiss bagel thin, which is what I ordered. I requested the swiss be replaced by cream cheese. The clerk asked if I wouldn't mind a \"70 cent\" upcharge. Immediately I think this strange that I get charged additionally for one cheese over another, but I'm in a rush and not overly worried about 70 cents. When another clerk rings me up, the bill was $1.50 more than I expected. Yes, they charged me $1.50 extra for cream cheese. I inquired as to why the incredibly high upcharge, to which the clerk curtly replies, \"sorry.\" When my sandwich finally arrived (the other issue was the incredibly long time it took to place the order, another long wait to pay, and yet another long wait to receive the bagel--interestingly enough there were only a few other people in the store), the asparagus was ice cold and the bagel hardly toasted. All in all, this was a bad enough experience to never revisit this or any other Einstein Bros location."}
{"text":"Sourdough lox bagels with onions, tomatoes and capers with European roast coffee.  We miss their fresh squeezed OJ, but \"from concentrate\" is not too bad.  EB is even better than Wolfgang Puck's in LAX."}
{"text":"Awful guest experience! My husband and I went in to eat lunch, the store was not busy at all with customers and they only had one person taking orders and making the sandwiches. The other two were standing their and talking. 15 minutes later our order is ready, he hands me a dirty bad full of camera that gets on my clothes and a green in eatable banana. Get in my car to leave and our order is wrong. Waste of time and money. I won't be going back to this Einstein's."}
{"text":"This review ultimately means nothing since Einstein's has a million locations and probably makes like a buyillion dollars, but I have to say it, because I don't understand why...I find both their bagels & their cream cheese way too \"fluffy\"! Both feel like they have been overly injected with air, I could eat like 20 of them and still be starving, a bowl of rice crispies gives me more satisfaction."}
{"text":"One star, only because I have too..
I waited a few weeks to write this review, as I believed all Einstein Bagel locations were created equal!!!! 
No, no and no.. not at this location. 
My arrival time was about 9:30 am with two people in line. And before I received service it was literally 20 minutes later, seems a little long to me.. to add insult, I purchased my everything bagel and they asked me if I want it toasted and I said yes please with a regular smear. Five minutes go by and they call my name for my bagel order, one bagel mind you, no greeting not even a word, not a good morning nothing! Geeez! I get in the car take my bagel out the bag and the smear drips everywhere!!  My hands, my pants suit, everywhere, it was just a hot! Melted mess!! Who does that, at least let the bagel cool down a little!! Not this location! Worst experience today, I won't be coming back to this location ever! Took too long for service and my bagel was the pits!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. I went at 1pm, and they were out of many flavors of bagels and were not willing to make more. Of course, they had plenty of the \"gourmet\" flavors that cost almost twice as much. They had also clearly labeled their pastries, but unfortunately had done so with the wrong labels and prices and didn't seem to care that they weren't accurate. The staff was rude and couldn't have cared less about customer service."}

{"text":"I come here for the coffee, bagels and the amazing service by Taylor aka sparkles! He is so professional and gives the best customer service!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. I asked for a  pumpernickel bagel with egg white, spinach, and mushroom, no cheese. They gave me a whole egg so I went back in and they fixed another with just the egg white. I was parked nearby but by the time I got to my car it was a soggy mess because they had not toasted the bagel?! Who prepares a sandwich bagel with cooked mushroom and spinach, both wet ingredients,  and doesn't toast the bagel?  Understandable low star rating."}
{"text":"I came in at 10am and there was no one in line. I ordered my food with a side of chips. It came out relatively quickly, I came home and my sandwich was not what I ordered nor were the chips in the bag. So I payed $10 for a sandwich I didn't ord"}
{"text":"I rarely give bad reviews however this place needs help. It's not that the food is bad, it's the service and time waiting. The food IS good, once you get it, but it takes FOREVER! I waited 17 minutes for 2 toasted buttered bagels. I wasn't the only one. The problem here seems to be organization and timing.  Perhaps they need more toasters or people, I don't know. But I can say that I wasn't the only one waiting, I personally witnessed  2 other customers that were unhappily waiting for the orders placed for 10+ minutes. That was within the crowd of 10+ people that were also waiting. C'mon EB. Step your game up! You have a good product... Do something about customer service. You need to be quicker with a product that everyone wants."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down.  Customer service and quality used to be top notch. No longer. Every unoccupied table in here has crumbs on it and needs to be wiped down. The floor could use a sweeping as well. And when I remarked that there was this huge fly soaring around, the guy who took my order had no reaction or comment whatsoever. Just nasty! All the while, the \"Manager\" is standing around talking. I've been coming here for years, but today will be my last time. I'll find a cleaner, friendlier place to enjoy my bagels and coffee."}
{"text":"After waiting a long period of time for some bagel sandwiches and spending nearly $20 for just 2 orders they manage to forget my sides even though we asked numerous times. And we even asked can we just purchase the sandwiches only and they said no it comes with sides.. well so much for that!! Waste of money and I didn't even go back because they would of probably taken another 20 mins just to get my sides!!"}
{"text":"This is a local place that I have gone to for breakfast and lunch. The bagels are very fresh and food is reasonably priced. Tends to be very busy on weekends so I like to go during the week. Parking is always crowded here as there are a few small businesses in this center. Lunch time is a little busy and you will probably have to wait for a cleaned table and spot to sit."}
{"text":"This goes out to the assistant manager that walked out on his staff today because he was overwhelmed.  Also appreciate that you announced that you where on break during the rush on Sunday morning and sorry for interrupting your break to assist the line during peak hours.  I believe you should have helped out instead of just standing their shaking your head and complaining how bad your staff is while they try to push the food out.   Just shows that you don't care enough to train your staff correctly.  Also watched 2 employees enter the restroom wearing aprons.  Why would you allow this? Upon leaving we saw the assistant manager sitting in his SUV smoking his vape pen while the staff was trying to play catch up.   If you don't know how to be a team player, then the restaurant industry is not for you."}
{"text":"Always a smile at 5:30am!! Love the bagels. Staff is great, sometimes challenged when busy though. Price is a little high but the quality is a justification. (Coupons are suggested)"}
{"text":"Normaly I would give this a better review, not this time though. Ok, rant time! Jalepeno shmear, put some on the damn bagel... oh and when I see you dont, I decided to order an extra side and considering it is very freaking small you charge $1.64. Pfffffft! NY Bagels on Deer Valley WAY BETTER!"}
{"text":"Walked in here and had a choice of maybe 4 different bagels they were out of everything at 11 am I was told they are 45 min out on other bagels.  I walked out and went to us egg. Never again will I go to this location."}
{"text":"If you are going to be greeting customers or interacting with customers make sure it is without attitude. She has attitude In her voice and all over her face. You guys no longer have the No Yolk sandwich that I always get. Instead of helping out they stand around looking stupid. Service is terrible and as a store GM myself this store does not seem to be run very good."}
{"text":"This morning my husband asked on the way in to work what I wanted for breakfast and I said \"lets get a bagel, we haven't had one in a while\"  We have bagels quite often and this is the store we come to. Not because we WANT to come here, but because it is the only bagel shop on the way to work.  Every single time and I mean ever single time I get a bagel I ask for extra schmeer because the regular order looks like the waved the cream cheese over the top and whatever jumps on is what you get.  Even when I order extra (which I am happy to pay for)  I have to check, and as you can imagine every time even after I check, there is NEVER extra cream cheese.  I used to write to the corporate office myself and let them know and they'll send me a coupon for a free one, but I really don't need a free bagel.  I'm HAPPY to pay for them.  Well after today, I am no longer going to write to the head office and complain as it is a waste of my time and it does absolutely NOTHING for their quality control.  Today I decided I would try something different and save myself the hassle of checking to see if my bagel was right and just ordered one of their breakfast sandwiches.  With tax they cost nearly $6.00.  Again the cost isn't the issue here.  What I got for it was this disgusting thrown together pathetic sandwich.  I'm not going to bother with writing to the head office to get yet again another *free* bagel that I'd still have to check blah blah blah.  I'm taking it right here so that others can know to stay away from this company.  I'm going to get up an extra 15 minutes early and go to Chompies when I want a bagel.  I've had it with you guys.  Oh, the good thing that did happen this morning is that the Starbucks next door actually knows how to treat people and they do it with a smile on their face. You suck.  Yes I am that mad.  Next stop... Facebook and Google."}
{"text":"My biggest complaint is having to order at one computer then having to stand there and listen to it reread two feet away by a totally different person. Why does it even need to be loaded in the first computer? It really slows down the line and half the customers change their order I.e. Drink size, add a cream cheese or oj from the cold section, etc. Definitely seems inefficient!On the weekend the parking can be a little bit of an issue, but you don't wait too long for a spot to open up. However, the service is always friendly and my order is always right so I can't complain too much!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this simply as a reminder to myself; do not go here again. You ought to be disappointed.

Bagels are fine, schmears are fine, coffee; okay. But their customer service sucks so bad.

The only person who showed friendliness I expect from employees was Taylor. He was courteous and nice. 
Everyone else working there obviously hates their job with gut and that shows, very clearly and loudly. No one can even pretend like they care about what they do there.  7 employees, still cannot handle the Monday(assume it's one of their busier days)crowd, and they are more frustrated than customer having to wait 10 min for a bagel with cream cheese on it.

And their schmearfuls...not worth it. Nope. Don't understand how just a smaller version of bagel, which is their speciality, with stuffing inside can lose so much integrity as \"bagel\". It was more like mandu with cream cheese filling. No bite, just mushy dough with filling...
Bantam Bagel is way better!"}
{"text":"Their bagels are good and so is there coffee, but the team here is unfriendly and grumpy and as a place that you go to in the morning to wake up and start your day the last thing you want is to walk into a place where no one is smiling much less even making eye contact.  Don't get me wrong, the service isn't bad they just aren't friendly and always seemed to be inconvenienced."}
{"text":"This place has got me addicted to their bagels and shmear! I never lived close enough to a bagel place to frequent it, but with Costco offering discounted gift cards and with the many locations throughout Vegas (even one in the airport), I can't help myself. My favorite combos are definitely an Everything Bagel with Garden Veggie or Cinnamon with Honey Almond. There's usually a long line out the door during the morning, but I think it's mostly due to one of the female workers who's a bit slower on taking the orders. The people who ring you up or working on making and prepping the orders are super fast though and make up for it. I like how the workers will bring you your order directly if they see you getting up or remember you. Parking is super easy and convenient, but I wish all of the Einstein locations had longer hours.  

Side note: The other day there was a boy selling newspapers outside and holding the door open for customers, he was very nice, but those newspapers were pricey. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Bagels are always good. The nova lox bagel was on point.  The low cal egg white sandwich was fine but not remarkable. Nice casual way to spend a Sunday morning chilling with the family."}
{"text":"Not very please with place. They try to up sale u. I order a small white chocolate mocha. Quinton goes \"it's 25 cents more\" and I said okay. I look at the menu and it was more than 25 cents. I asked him to changed and he supposedly did. I read the recipe and it said regular. The girl at the counter said it was the same size and made a rude face. If it was a small it would of said \"small\" or \"sm\". They both lied. This place sucks!!"}
{"text":"They are always out of the essential, popular bagels, like Asiago...an essential bagel, that is not an outrageous bagel. It's a normal bagel for a bagel shop to have. You could have an advantage over other breakfast/lunch places b/c you offer unique bagels for breakfast and lunch, like green chili, but again, never in stock. If something is popular, stock it more. Business 101. A bagel shop that is always out of bagels. Come on...."}
{"text":"Foods ok here. I come here all the time because it's down the street from my apartment. Unfortunately I get waited on by the same tall skinny girl that has an attitude. I'm going to find a different location because it makes everything unpleasant when you get that kind of customer service. She was literally drinking her drink and chewing ice while I was trying to speak and as she was speaking back I couldn't understand her with her mouth full of ice. I literally had to walk away today. RUDE."}
{"text":"I love Enstein's! I go there almost everyday. The workers are very nice. The food is excellent!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to come here because of the negative reviews, but I'm happy to report a very good experience. Very fast service and the employees were courteous."}
{"text":"Great location. On Warm Springs just before Eastern Avenue  in the Albertsons Shopping Plaza.  I went there for breakfast and after a small debate between my eyes and tummy I ordered The Cheesey Wakin'Bacon and a frozen carmel drink.  The sandwich was good but the bacon seemed a little more fat than meat. It also tasted extra salty but who doesn't love salt?  They were out of the Chessey bagels that normally come with the sandwich so I choose an asiago bagel instead.  It turned out to be a good choice as it quickly settled the debate my eyes and tummy were having and made the rest of me smile too. I wish they had another alternative to real milk and soy milk. Perhaps coconut or almond or hemp milk as a healthier alternative to dairy and soy products.  The staff were friendly and helpful. They did bring our drinks and food to our table.  The store was clean and if they were to add another choice other than milk and soy I would consider eating here again.  If you're looking for the perfect breakfast place in Las Vegas I'm sorry but this place won't sizzle your bacon so keep looking. Please let me know your favoriteplace to get a good breakfast sandwich in Las Vegas?"}
{"text":"I have love for Einstein bagels but they never answer their phones, you wait foreverrrrrrr to get your breakfast, I had to stop coming here because I was late to work every morning.  also one more thing I think is gross bums can walk in off the street with a cup and get coffee, touching the pots of milk and coffee,  um im sorry not good, I was grossed out the other day when I saw this.  I am not trying to be mean I know they have to eat and drink but at least maybe wash down the items once they touch it."}
{"text":"I found this location on Yelp when looking for breakfast around 8am. The employees were prompt and very polite. I ordered the turkey sausage, egg and cheese on an everything bagel. It was easily one of the best I've had at an Einstein's!

The coffee was also great, though I poured the last cup of their neighborhood blend. I let them know and by the time I was walking out, they had refilled all of coffee options. Glad to see attentive service like that."}
{"text":"Very good bagels and coffee. Don't really like to set up. Feels like you're waiting in line all around the tables were people are sitting. The area where you put cream and sugar in you coffee is a mess."}
{"text":"Love Einstein's. Nothing negative to say. There bagels are always awesome  and service is always on point! Great place to stop for a quick bite if you're in a hurry"}
{"text":"We loved, loved, loved the Nova Bagel! The apple cinnamon bagel was our dessert. Yum! Service was prompt and friendly. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I ordered a half dozen bagels. Didn't check the bag. Didn't think I had too. When I got home there were only 5 bagels. I called just to let them know to be more careful and accurate. The person who answered the phone laughed and thought it was funny. Definitely agree that the staff here need more service training."}
{"text":"I love einsteins bagels.  Great prices!"}
{"text":"I ordered a tuna sandwich which was very heavily peppered. It wasn't bad, but not something I would order if I knew before hand. They were nice enough to replace the tuna with a chicken salad sandwich. Took them no time at all. The guy was really nice. The sandwich was nothing special but the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"I am truly saddened by my recent trip from this location.  Normally they're super busy, which I totally understand and am use to. But it's comes to a point when it's too busy for even the staff to handle and everyone's food and drinks gets lost in transit and even wrong orders! I waited 25 minutes for a simple sausage and egg bagel with a chai. 5 people behind me had an issue with their order and they had to remake and fix everything. They put my order on a plate when I said Togo. And the one guy dropped 4 cups (I counted) before trying to even attempt making the simplest drink. I feel bad for the owners, while their employees are wasting their money left and right. 
So the guy started making mine and my boyfriends Carmel Mach drink, he walked away and another lady walked up and tried finishing them off. All of a sudden the paper was out at the register and there was all of a sudden a blended chai, a chai, and Carmel Mach made, and she got frustrated and threw them all away!! Because she wanted to be sure they were made correctly, I'm sure. 
But still, just in my time there, they wasted 3 whole drinks and 4 cups on the ground. 
Someone needs to manage that place more or get more managers on staff and train employees on learning the flow, and certain positions. It was a wreck in there and I felt so bad for everyone working. 
Hopefully they'll make some nice adjustments soon."}
{"text":"I got breakfast here every day during my business trip to Phoenix. It's not amazing, but not bad.. I particularly like the blackberry lemonade...sweet and tart and refreshing mmmm. The employees were not very friendly, but that didn't stop me from enjoying my everything bagel with cream cheese and blackberry lemonade. :)"}
{"text":"Very under staffed .saturdays will always be busy and to have two cash registers and only one being use. When i first moved here this place was great . Now it is falling apart."}
{"text":"Why is this store constantly running out of bagels?  Today they had 8 everything bagels but would only sell me 6 claimed they were for other customers but no one else was in line in front or in back of me, hmm.  Make more bagels or get out of the business!"}
{"text":"The most disorganized mess of a crew I've seen. Total lack of leadership and accountability. I'm a frequent customer and it's not getting any better. Don't order anything special at all, they will surely miss what's clearly displayed 2 feet in front of them and hand you an incorrect order without fail. It's pretty pathetic and sad that a \"franchise\" could be operated so poorly when the majority of the guesswork in running a business has been removed for you. Cheers to the next 3 store managers!"}
{"text":"I love coming here.  The bagels are always perfectly made and there's a huge selection of flavors.  Blueberry to Cheddar jalapeño.  Not all bagels are created equal.  But let me say... this place has great customer service. Every time I come here I'm complemented, I'm asked for my AMAZING name, and the chit chat is quick and cheerful.  If you're having a bad day just come here to buy a bagel and you'll leave feel like a super star! I'm not even kidding.  :)"}
{"text":"This location really gives bagel places a bad name. 


I don't know why I continue to keep trying and going back to this establishment. Probably because it is right across the street from work.

No matter what I order a bagel with cream cheese or a egg and cheese on a bagel it just takes forever.

This morning I literally walked out when I was online. They had about 6 people waiting to order for over 10 minutes!

Secondly, I don't love their food that takes 6 hours to make. that is being handled by ex cons working there and people who do not care about their 

I am not going back. I mean it this time. For real I will be going to chompies which is a mile away and get better, faster, and product."}
{"text":"Even after all this low carb craze, bagels still taste good and is a good food to eat. Einstein bagels makes some of the freshest bagels, and what it comes down to is the preparation and the water they use. Definitely go for a quick breakfast bite!"}
{"text":"60 Cents for a small PACKET of jelly?  The blond manager seems like she's mad at the world.  We like to deal with happy people.  On one occasion we saw a fly in the bagel case.  When we brought it to their attention, they were not concerned.  Maybe the Health Department needs to pay them a visit."}
{"text":"I hit Einstein's on my way back to Jenni's.  I couldn't resist their deal- a dozen bagels with two tubs of cream cheese. There were a lot of people at her house anyways. We were all getting ready for Jenni's wedding. I hadn't had their bagels in a very long time and was looking forward to it. In between pictures I ripped up my bagel, smothered it with cream cheese, and stuffed it into my mouth. It was soft, fresh, and creamy.  

Oh, how I missed you Einstein."}
{"text":"Probably the worst run Einstein's bagels. We live close by and go often because there is no other bagel shop in Arcadia... 
Every single time is a failure and today was no difference. 10:30 on a Sunday and they are out of bagels (poppy ) and took 8 minuted to figure it out. No apology, no care."}
{"text":"This is the second morning I have come to this particular location.  I have now been late to work for the past 2 days.  It was not due to the store being busy, it was a complete lack of organization and employees did not move w a purpose.  On both occasions, the cashier was wondering aimlessly while 5+ customers waited in line. The frustration and lack of service that the other patrons and I felt, could have been avoided if the employees had been focused.  I will sadly not return to this location, even though it is on the way to my office."}
{"text":"I always have a great experience here. The people are very nice and the bagels are delicious. Service is everything to me and the the customer service is on point it always makes for an amazing experience. I have the pretzel bagel with blueberry schmear and I also love the bacon and egg sandwich."}
{"text":"Don't go here. They keep messing up my order. The receipt says I paid for the correct food but it is not what I end up receiving. I'm lactose intolerant and I always ask for no cheese on my sandwich. I keep getting the wrong sandwich with cheese and a cheese bagel. How hard is it to prepare bagels? I would give this place no stars if it were an option."}
{"text":"Maybe the bagels are good, but i made the mistake of getting a chicken sandwich.. Yuck!"}
{"text":"It was my first time eating there and I had questions, of course. They were willing to answer my questions, but you could tell everyone seemed tired or had an attitude. They messed up my order and I took it back. Then they got it wrong a second time. I tipped them well and I did not have a complicated order. I suggest you should go to another location, but unfortunately I will never eat at this bagel company locations again."}
{"text":"Totally messed up my drink order after I waited for it forever."}
{"text":"I love this location of Einstein's!! The manager Mishelle is awesome and always remembers my name. The bagels are fresh and good. The coffee is a bit pricey for what it is but there is a Starbucks next door. They don't have wifi but like I said there is a Starbucks next door. The parking is ample because of the Safeway parking lot and I've never had to wait long at this location. Great for breakfast on the weekend.

My favorite is  the turkey sausage sandwich on asiago."}
{"text":"Einstein's just makes my heart happy. This one has had the same lady working the register since I started coming here, she's super sweet and they always keep the place in good shape. I like this location because they have a huge patio out back and I can bring my dog. Sometimes they even have doggie bagels. No drive through though."}
{"text":"There can't be a restaurant as universally incompetent as Einsteins. I can't remember getting a multiple sandwich order at any Einsteins that wasn't incorrect. Here, neither employee knew how to run the register, and the turkey, bacon avocado sandwich was missing lettuce, tomato and spread as described on the menu. Had to drive back to get it fixed. Not as bad as once at the Desert Ridge location where the sandwich came with no turkey, but had the expiration label from the Turkey package in the middle. How can that even happen? I guess going back with hopes of a better result is on me. I apologize for my foolishness, and won't make the same mistake again."}
{"text":"There is nothing better on a Saturday morning than to have a cinnamon sugar bagel with honey butter (healthy eh?).  This location was pretty packed when we came in, which is understandable at 10am on a Saturday.

I was also impressed to see other selections beyond plan bagels, such as a PB&J baked good, pastry's and other items.  I look forward to venturing around the menu, as Einstein's has never really disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love Einstein Bros Bagels, I would normally give them 4 stars for the yummy food and drink options but 3 stars is for this location. We decided to give them a try since it's near my house and when we entered, I noticed that all of the tables had crumbs on them! None of the tables were cleaned while we were there and there were many chairs not pushed in either.
As for service and food, the gentleman helping us was really nice, took our order, rang us up and made our food. He looked like the only worker there at the time so maybe that's why all the tables were left a mess. My boyfriend decided on the Pizza Bagel with Pepperoni on the Six Cheese bagel and I went with the Green Chili Club on the Jalepeno Bagel. Both were perfectly made, really warm and fresh when we got them as well as having a hefty amount of toppings and ingredients. Yum! I'll definitely be back to this location since it's near my place, I just really wish it'd be clean next time. It's kind of unappetizing eating on a dirty table (well I cleaned the one we used) but it's also kind of gross to be eating and looking at messy tables and unswept floors (I noticed lots of crumbs under tables as well).
As for some deals they are offering right now, on Mondays you can get 13 bagels for only $6! Also you can pick up some of their seasonal bagels if you come early enough (they were all sold out when I got there) such as Pumpkin, Red Velvet, French Toast, and Gingerbread with their new Icing and Pumpkin Schmear :)"}
{"text":"Great food, not so great barista knowledge. I've given a few \"lessons\" in Americano drink building here. Not sure if employees were new, but higher expectations from a place with an expensive espresso machine. 
I take my coffee cravings two miles down the street to DD now."}
{"text":"Great location and decent Custy service. Usually stop in every other week for a bagel. Super backed up today and waited 30mins for two bagels....I will reconsider bagels next time there is a long line."}
{"text":"Horrible service. They have messed up my order twice. I had to call customer service and complain and they kept messing up my order. It's no complicated to read an order when making a sandwich. Since the one manager left Tom it's not the same place and they don't take care of their customers. Not happy with this place."}
{"text":"This is our breakfast chow spot on lazy weekend mornings. Fast service and pretty good bagels. It's close and near everything else shopping wise. Very nice patio to chill on right there next to the Sbucks."}
{"text":"Management and staff are the best!
They bend over backwards to make your experience positive.

A great place to study and hang out  in a nice intimate setting or grab a quick \"pick me up\" in the afternoon. I love the cinnamon sugar bagel clusters. (I highly recommending splitting the chocolate chip coffee cake between 3 people to cut down on the caloric intake!) Plus they have fresh brewed black iced tea, and as anyone who has read my reviews knows, I am always on the hunt for amazingly tasty and fresh iced tea.

Outlets are more accessible than the University street location which is always a bonus when studying for long periods of time.  And it's in a great spot to grab something to eat right before you need to hop on the interstate to rode trip."}
{"text":"As stone as I walked in I was met with a hello from staff. Bathroom was very clean. Eating area was nice and clean. Food prep area was clean. Potato salad is the best. Love all the bagels."}
{"text":"Located in the Southwest Terminal B Eistein Bros Bagels has a decent menu:
Breakfast wraps, Lunch wraps, bagels, breakfast bagels, bagel sandwiches, coffee drinks, fresh juices etc.  

There was also a pretty large staff on hand for a Saturday morning to make your food quickly.  Unfortunately the food and drinks come out scorching hot. My breakfast wrap and caramel latte were practically burning my hands and there was no way you could eat or drink them til they cooled down.  My wrap contained, eggs, turkey sausage, pepper jack cheese and salsa.  The wrap was supposed to have jalapeno smear, but it came with salsa instead.  The only thing I could taste was the salsa.  I took a bite out of the egg and sausage separately and they pretty didn't taste like anything.  My coffee was also very sweet.  Prices are pretty reasonable for airport food, but we will not be trying this place again."}
{"text":"This might be the worst ran establishment that I have ever been to.  Had to wait over 45 min for my coffee & bagel( not the one I ordered because they ran out).  I stopped in on a Sunday morning at 9 am.  No one in line but about 20 people standing waiting for their food.  People where so packed in waiting you could not get to coffee machine. About have the bagel selection had ran out.. I know what people are going to say\"it's Sunday morning they ran out\" & I say it's Sunday morning you should plan properly( expect lots of people).  As a stared my review I noticed that I'm not the only one that believes this place might want to find some new leadership & employees."}
{"text":"I come here often early in the morning on my way to work. I sure wish there was another one that wasn't so far out-of-the-way. The morning manager is just not friendly. As many times as I have been in there she never smiles, never remembers my name, and seems that she is just extremely unhappy. It is also often dirty.  The bagels are good but the environment and atmosphere is unpleasant.  Go to a different location if possible!"}
{"text":"I walked in and the first thing I noticed was the trash overflowing and balled up napkins on the floor. Walking past that I noticed not a single table had been wiped down as there were crumbs and leftover spinach sitting on top of them. The chairs were askew as if not one employee could take the time to walk the floor. I paid extra for additional toppings that I found were not added when I had left. I've never been influenced to write a review before but this experience was literally deserving of the scathing comment. Never going to this location again. The manager should be ashamed."}
{"text":"Fool me once, shame on you...fool me twice, shame on me.  Based on that philosophy, I should be giving myself only one star for making the assenine decision to return to this location.

Several years ago, a co-worker and I were in a hurry to get several bagels for a breakfast presentation that had been forgotten.  In our haste, both of us stressed to the people behind the counter the importance of making sure each bagel was cut before they were put in the tray and we were, subsequently, told by two people that it would be done.  When we returned to the office, we discovered that none of them had been cut and we only had a few moments to hand cut two dozen bagels.

This morning, my same co-worker and I stopped off for breakfast on the go.  We each ordered a toasted bagel with cream cheese and she ordered a blended coffee drink.  She received her blended coffee drink first and threw it away after one drink.  Apparently it tasted like \"drinking espresso beans and that's all.\"  After the drink came and went, we stood and watched as the woman that had ordered after us received her prepared bagel sandwich.  The couple that ordered after her received their breakfast order.  And the couple that ordered after them received their bag of half a dozen bagels all sliced.  Let me reiterate that we ordered ONLY two toasted bagels with spread.  After a fifteen minute wait, our order was brought to us.

There's a location on Rainbow that always manages to get things done while maintaining a decent amount of customer service.  I'd rather be late to work then frequent this location ever again."}
{"text":"Spent $31 on three nova lox bagels, 2 coffees and an orange juice. Got home and found a long piece of nasty blond hair in my food. I called for a refund and they put me on hold for 5 min. Then the woman gets on the phone and asks if I have my receipt. I said no because I wasn't expecting to return food. She said she could offer a refund because I didn't have proof of purchase. I told her I will bring back your bagel with the hair - that's proof. She said I could have gone into the trash and got the bagel. Yes - she actually says that. What kind of trash person do you have to be to say that. Ps: how about wearing hair nets while preparing food. Now I'm going to contest the entire charge with my credit card company because of how incompetent these people are. How about starting with an apology rather than excusing me of dumpster diving. Never going back to your rotten store. Lousy people."}
{"text":"I've never eaten breakfast at Einstein Bros. Actually I've never had anything from Einstein bros but thanks to the groupon deal, my bf and I decided to stop by. I think for $5ish for a breakfast bagel is on the pricey side but it was SO good. I don't remember what we ordered but it had ham, cheese and some type of spread on a cheese bagel and I couldn't believe how delicious it was. The coffees here are a bit on the sweet side, so I would recommend getting LESS sweet when you order their coffees. We did wait a bit for our food and drinks, but it wasn't too bad. There's a ton of seating and I saw 3 other people just hanging out eating or reading a newspaper while they ate. 

A lot of the bagels were sold out when we came in around 11 AM so get there early!"}
{"text":"I came here two days in a row. Bagel was great but the services sucks! The cashier is so rude. My first visit I just thought  maybe they were rude because it's busy and they are over whelmed next day no one in sight when I walk into the store and they are still rude even rude then day before. Two different cashiers both rude. I really wouldn't go out of my way to go to this place again."}
{"text":"Very bright, clean, fast, friendly service. I came here instead of Bruegger's since they have changed/eliminated some bagel flavors. 
I there are differences in what people like, but can not get beyond what they consider a bagel. I think their recipe ole is just bread.  It's not the denseness of the dough and outterness qualities of what I believe a true bagel represents. 

It was difficult to know what cream cheese flavors without asking. You also need to ask for the bagel and cream cheese to be sliced in half. 

So, I guess I am glad these 2 are almost next door to each other here on Rte 19 to hit both in one visit."}
{"text":"I usually go to take out for breakfast. Today and every time i go i get a thin egg whites with asparagus.The service is fast and the staff is friendly.The coffee is ok and ilke they have a variety of regular coffee to choose."}
{"text":"Time to carb up? Then head over to Einstein Brothers Bagels. 

Nice variety of bagels, they toast them at your request. Today I had the asiago bagel with a low fat schmear for just $2.60. I have used this particular store for many years. At 7am there was only one person in line ahead of me. Service was fast, seating was a wood chair at a wood table. Parking is close to the door. The coffee is OK here (not bitter).

They also serve sandwiches and lunch items, but I would pass on those. I have seen other customers with those items and the portion size seems pretty skimpy and not particularly appetizing. 

If your goal is to score consistently good bagels, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I love this location. The employees are super friendly and always super helpful. The large selection of bagels and drinks are fabulous. It's always clean and wish the lines weren't as long as they are sometimes in the morning. Everything I've ever had has always been fresh. Only complaint, when I ask for extra cream cheese, I expect a ton not a thinly spreader amount."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast and decided to try the Avocado. Wrost bagel I have ever had! I could not even finish half of half of a bagel. Please be advised do not order!#Einsteinbagels#yuck#avocadotoast"}
{"text":"Are product knowledge and convenience too much to ask for?

I didn't have my eye glasses with me and couldn't see the small print on the menu board.  I asked the cashier what came on the Herbivore.  She said, \"Hummus, tomato\" [pause] \"and other veggies\".  I was suspicious of the hesitation and incomplete reply.  I should have known better than to trust her.  I received the Herbivore made correctly per the menu (which I later checked from home), but it was NOT what she advised me.  Since I don't care for Einstein cream cheese, I was very disappointed that it came with cream cheese, but not the hummus I was promised.

Then there was the orange juice.  They place a sticker in such a way that it connects the plastic cup and lid together AND it overlaps the straw insert cutout.  The sticker glue works a little too well, making it a nightmare to remove and insert the straw.  Bottom line, I ended up with OJ everywhere but my stomach.

Finally, the restroom.  The locks are a complete waist.  First, they don't keep anyone with a code out.  Second, they don't work.  My profuse apologies to the poor women I walked in on who was trying to have a moment of privacy."}
{"text":"Unorganized Chaos
The bagels are tasty but no sense of order in the place. I must say that it has been this way for years and I have come to expect shortages of bagels no matter the time of day. Today for example the ONE container containing some form of creamer was empty, I have no idea what it was because it wasn't labeled."}
{"text":"Poor service can really turn business away especially when its rude service. this morning I ordered three bagels and loxes all of which were to be warmed up in the oven. the cashier repeats the other and he says all three unwarmed. I told him I requested for them all to be warm so he told the two girls that were making the bagels on the line.  the short girl by the name of tina, teena? yelled \"but I already made them\" and she rolled her eyes so clearly. this behavior is absolutely poor and unprofessional considering you work in a customer service position and as a paying customer I'm standing right here in front of you and you have the audacity to react so rude.  the cashier hear her say well the third bagel is going to be another 10 mins because I don't have another one and he repeated it to me which I told him, I would happily take it on a wheat bagel but my order was to be warmed. the employee rolled her eyes again and loudly vented to her coworker who passed by her saying \" I made this order already but I have to make it again because its not toasted\" . to witness this behavior is just so astonishing. some advice, if you don't want to work as simple of a place as Einstein bagel then don't because this attitude is unacceptable especially when you're getting paid to work."}
{"text":"Well... For the first time ever, we were disappointed by a visit to this brand. This particular location was either having a bad day or they really need to get their act together. Our order wasn't complicated. Several bagels... Some toasted with regular cream cheese... Some toasted with blueberry cream cheese. Got two coffees as well. Paid for food.... And stood there. The person that took my order was the same person that processed my credit card. She couldn't figure out why I was standing there. I told her it would be nice if I had cups to get my coffee. Keep in mind it had been literally less than a minute since she took my order. Got the cups, got coffee... Sadly it was lukewarm at best. We have ordered in many of the Einstein bagel locations over the years and know how long it takes to get the food out. This place was not busy.... And the food took about 10 minutes to come out. They got the blueberry cream cheese bagels wrong and used regular cream cheese. OK I'm a bit upset now. I go back to the counter and tell them my order is wrong. Another customer with an incorrect order was near me and saw that I was up there for the same reason as her and as we made eye contact, she muttered to me \"good luck with getting that fixed. Clearly she was upset at her order being screwed up too. Anyway... They take it back and say they are very backlogged with orders at the moment. I get the replacement bagels about 5 minutes later. Correct bagels... Correct cream cheese.... But they didn't toast it like it was supposed to be. Overall, pretty disappointed in this location. Will continue enjoying the brand, but not at this location ever again."}
{"text":"The staff here is awesome!! The store is spotless clean, the servers are very friendly and they are really fat to get your order out"}
{"text":"Pretty sure most of the staff spent the morning at the dispensary. Zero urgency. It's like they smoked weed and got stuck in a tar baby along the way. Last time I'll ever darken these doors"}
{"text":"Incompetent and rude staff.  They make you wait 5 minutes just to take your order (without even acknowledging your presence).  Then they make your bagel wrong.  The last thing anyone who orders an everything bagel with chive cream cheese is an everything bagel with honey almond cream cheese.  Gross.  They argue with you that the incorrectly made bagel is correct.  They make you wait longer for the new one.  They do not even offer the common courtesy of a simple apology for wasting your time.  That was my first experience.  The second experience, I asked for my bagel to be toasted twice.  I saw the girl toast it once.  When I asked whether she toasted it twice, she yelled the toaster is broken-I can't toast it twice.  What?  Why is it my problem the toaster is broken?  And she had not toasted it twice.  The gentleman in front of me advised me to leave if I had not already paid because he had been waiting 20 minutes for 3 bagels.  These people should not be working with the public and even worse, probably could not answer - what is 2+2.  There is nothing complicated about toasting a bagel and treating customers with common courtesy.  This comes from someone who spent 10 years working in the restaurant industry."}
{"text":"Leslie is awesome!!!! Excellent customer service!! She made my morning. Bagels are amazing and always delicious. The workers here always know how to make my morning"}
{"text":"After waiting 20 minutes they finally tell me they are out of sausage for both my sandwiches. Had to get a different meat. Thanks for ruining my breakfast! Tell people sooner next time so they can just leave! 45 min round trip."}
{"text":"I like this location and the bagels are always fresh. 
The staff is kinda so-so, on good days I get friendly people, on others, it's like they don't care.. Which is fine, cause my order is always correct. 
Coffee refill is AWESOME!!! and so is free wifi."}
{"text":"Great location! Great service! The cashier that rings me up is always friendly. I always come here in the mornings to get ahead of the rush before school. Once I came around 7 on a weekday and all my favorite bagels were gone and it would be a while before they were ready.

Anywho, my favorite bagels are the spinach florentine bagel with garlic and herb shmear and I get the six cheese bagel with strawberry shmear. Both toasted. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Shame on you Einstein , was in this morning to pick up a few bagels. Of course it's a very busy Saturday morning and I do understand that it's going to take a bit. (I work in the food industry I GET IT) BUT,
Your customer service is terrible... when I placed my order there was one jalapeño cheese bagel left pointed it out and asked for it to be pulled.. It was not . Sat and watched as it was picked for the lady 4 people behind me. Then several minutes later was told there where no more. Several more minutes later was handed my order which had some random bagels in it.. REALLY EINSTEIN 
Get it together. I don't understand customer service done this way, and when I pointed this out all the employees just stared at me with that \"we don't care lady\" stare. I'm not one to ever do reviews but,, needed this to be heard ..."}
{"text":"Great bagels and AWSOME coffee. But every time I'm here they put barely any cream cheese on the bagel. Kinda doesn't make me want to come here any more."}
{"text":"Omg so gross, read the ingredients!! 

What do you think they put in broccoli cheddar soup? There are 20+ ingredients you can't pronounce!! Many ingredients are outlawed in other counties! The food quality here is literally disgusting. 

This place does not care about the bad reviews, the food will only get more synthetic. Sacrificing your health to make an extra buck is what big businesses do in America. 

It always takes awhile to get service or even greeted. They've been out of the bagel I've wanted several times and never say they are making more even early in the morning. 

If you read this review and still go to this place you are one scary person. If you can pronounce the ingredients you deserve an award. 

Please stop supporting places that serve the worst food possible. The 'stuff' they serve isn't even allowed outside of the US. Only in America do big business come before the citizens. 200 terrible reviews later and no response from management or corporate office. 

Enjoy your day and go have a salad!"}
{"text":"The service is pretty good, but there is always a long line in the morning. Our firm orders 2 dozens of bagels every Friday, and we have had problems with the order repeatedly. The other location on Lake Mead and Buffalo is much more spacious and on top of things. Still not a bad place but just make sure you give yourself enough time when picking up breakfast."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow
Only one person making food while not sure what others were doing in the back room.  Unless you have extra time....stay ear of this place if you can."}
{"text":"The worst Einstein's I have ever been to.  The staff is sullen, rude, and actively tries to avoid eye contact to avoid helping you.  The staff seems frustrated just taking your order."}
{"text":"The only problem I've ever had here was one in October when they were out of pumpkin, but they said all Einsteins in the area were. Aside from that, I've always enjoyed this location. It feels like a coffee shop inside, with people gathered to read papers and star their days. The ambiance almost makes me feel like I am back in college while I am there."}
{"text":"I walked in this morning and the manager greeted me with a \"Goooooood morning!\" Very cheery to be there. Everyone was very friendly. The eating area is a bit smaller than other Einstein's, but it is attached to a Starbucks, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"This lady with the blonde hair w a little bit of blue in it is seriously the meanest lady i've ever met in my life. just tryna get some early morning bagels and she's acting like a big ol diva about it. \"ORDERS AND PAYMENTS DOWN HERE PLEASE\" spouted at you in the most evil voice in the word. she is a sassy mCsasserton and someone's gotta do something about this. lady if you are reading this, stop being mean, you sassy pants"}
{"text":"The bagel was yummy as expected.  The servers were nice.  The coffee is just average."}
{"text":"As a former Phoenician and now a resident of New York City, I always love visiting Einsteins on Indian School and 44th St becausewhen I'm in town because I love the jalapeño bagel toasted with jalapeño cream cheese. My visit back today was absolutely less than a wonderful experience. The staff seems \"rushed\" yet the store wasn't that busy, what's the hurry? Then I ordered a toasted bagel that was clearly rushed through the toaster and luke warm at best. Then, a bagel with cream cheese (coming from someone who lives and dies by NY bagels) should have more cream cheese than a quick swoop over the bagel with a knife. When there's so little cream cheese on a bagel it fails to actually cover the entire bagel, it's not good enough. Put some cream cheese on a bagel when people ask for it and stop trying to cut corners to save a few pennies."}
{"text":"Very very bad, if you come after 9am don't expect to get any bagels or most of anything. Always sold out. I guess they don't want to make extra because of cut backs."}
{"text":"Always Fresh and Delicious 


The bagels are always fresh and delicious .  Great selection for both breakfast and lunch.  I'm a fan of the everything bagel with garden veggie schmere.  However,  I never pass up the pumpkin bagels with pumpkin schmere in the Fall.

I don't care for breakfast, but I most def love bagels. Forever and always. I enjoy stopping here here and there for a quick breakfast/brunch and grabbing freshly squeezed OJ or strawberry lemonade. One day I got a latte and wasn't too pleased with the taste, but the crew hooked it up and fixed it by adding a bit more hazelnut. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Amazing bagels but average service . They are under staffed and also the manager isn't the nicest . She has a bit of an attitude ."}
{"text":"Andrea gave me great service when I came in, I ordered a pepperoni pizza bagel and it's absolutely delicious. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I really like Einstein but this location needs some help.  The staff seems exhausted, the lines and service are slow and the floors and tables stay dirty.  Management wake up call.
Haven't been back since the last three times showed no signs of improvement."}
{"text":"The customers tend to stare like they have never seen a hungover girl covered in tattoos who just wants a toasted bagel to make her feel better.
Other than that, its always yummy. I would ask for light cream cheese tho, otherwise they put a layer like 6 inches thick on there."}
{"text":"It's been a while since my last visit, but Never a Disappointment. Always friendly staff, greeted when upon entering, and always full with customers. Love this place. Huge thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Their bagels are good as well as their coffee.  My only gripe is that I've been here twice and both times they burned the bagel toasting it and gave it to me burnt. Who the heck eats burnt bagels? What employee would think someone would eat it burnt and still serve it. Both times I got it to go so I had to come back both times to get it fixed. Needless to say I will never return to this Einsteins."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst places for customer service....4 out of 5 times, the order is not correct.   I considered  but decided to give it another try.   They didn't let me down...after placing my order for a single pretzel bagel and waiting almost 15 minutes...was told that it was going to be another 15 minutes since they had run out of pretzel bagels.  Not sure why I could not have been told that when I ordered and prior to standing there for so long.  This place consistently provides horrible customer service and I am unsure why whoever owns it doesn't make approvements.  There are so many negatives comments not only on this website, but also on the Next
Door app for the community that they have to be aware.  I will never make the mistake of going here again!"}
{"text":"They treated me well the few times I have been here.  The speed of service has been good, even when busy.  Their bagels and schmeer have been consistently good."}
{"text":"John, the district manager contacted me in response to the poor display of professionalism and general lack of humanity I witnessed as a described in my last review. 

He asked me to brief him on what had happened on Sunday and I explained how is stand-in manager was acting like a two year old and creating a hostile work environment for other employees, and an overall tense and awkward atmosphere for customers. He took my concern seriously and seemed genuinely empathetic. He stated that Einstein's does not tolerate this type of behavior and he's very saddened and disappointed that Cody behaved this way, especially in front of customers. John assured me that he and the general manager would address the issue and also go over possible training flaws to prevent this in the future. 

Overall, I'm glad that someone in management is now aware. Hopefully the service, atmosphere, and Cody's ethics will improve and he can learn and grow from this experience instead of regress."}
{"text":"Service always is quick. Kids love their bagels. I find the bagels just ok but I'm from NY so they have a lot to live up to in my book. Love their blackberry lemonade. On most occasions there is always someone there offering to throw away my garbage. So they are paying attention to their customers. That's nice to see since I consider it a fast food kind of place."}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful service in comparison to other locations i've been to.

I have always loved their bagels. :-)"}
{"text":"This is consistently the most unorganized Einsteins we go to. We try to avoid this location but when we find ourselves here our hopes are that they've improved. Year after year we've found they they stay consistent: unorganized and confused."}
{"text":"Great place for a good and quickly served Breakfast! All the folks at this site work quickly and ensure that the order is accurate and keep the line moving!!! Great place for a good breakfast!!! Outstanding team!!! Keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"I really want to give Einstein's a five stars because the food is always delicious. I have no doubts about the quality of food. It always tastes fresh. The coffee is also delicious. Much better than Starbucks coffee in my humble opinion.
However, there is a bit of inconsistency coming out of this location. I always order the bacon spinach Panini. Depending on who makes it, it always seems to come out different. Also depending on the staff it either takes 2 minutes with a huge crowd or 15 minutes with just one person ahead of me. 
I feel the staff can be very unorganized at times but I do not blame them for this. In my opinion, organization of staff and how a business is run comes from the higher up management and training. 
One example of this would be: I ordered a caramel macchiato and I noticed the employee who cashes people out is also the one who makes the coffee for the customers. After she cashed me out, she stood there and continues to take payments. Well... people kept coming in and ordering and she continued to stand there and look frazzled while taking payments.
On another Occasion: I ordered a caramel macchiato and the girl taking payments kindly asked a few customers to wait after cashing me out. She started to make my coffee, took another persons payment. Then finished my coffee. She was done in under 2 minutes with my coffee instead of the previous version of this which took 15 minutes.
So again, there seems to be a bit of inconsistency and organization with the staff. Things should be able to flow smoothly and run at a pace that is smart and timely to benefit the customers who are on their way to work in the morning and want to be in and out. It should never take 15 minutes for a coffee just because it gets a little busy. Other people can wait to be cashed out or to take an order. Get to the people who have already ordered are waiting first. It only makes sense.
Instead I see people who have ordered being pushed back and pushed back when it gets busy. To me this is unfair. If you get there and there's only one person in front of you and you order one thing it should take two minutes. Instead if they get a rush it could now takes 20 minutes because they will put your order on the back burner to accommodate the people walking in the front door."}
{"text":"Meh... I have 2 locations near my house.
I normally go to the other one. There are many times when they are out of the types of bagels that I wanted much earlier than expected. So today I tried this other location. The selection here was pretty bad too.

To be clear, it's not like I'm showing up 10 minutes to closing time and expecting a full selection of bagels. I'm showing up a good 4 or 5 hours prior to closing and finding a very very sparse selection. I understand that they don't want to have to throw out too many bagels at the end of the night, but they also have to understand that if customers are consistently finding little to no flavor choices available, they may stop coming in altogether because they're tired of making the trip only to be disappointed. 

In addition, the layout at this location is strange. When you walk in to buy bagels, you have to look at the case where the bagels are to see what kinds they currently have, right? 
So I assumed that was where you would also order said bagels. Evidently that is not the case. 

After myself and the two people behind me stood in front of the bagel case for probably 3 or 4 minutes with no greeting or assurance that somebody would be with us (despite 2 or 3 ppl working there & clearly walking past and seeing us), the guy from the cash register around the corner yelled out that he would take my order over there when I was ready. 

I walked over asked him if the selection was limited to what was in the window, or if they had any stock in the back. He said it was just what they have in the window. I told him I want a Baker's Dozen box, but due to the limited choices, I suppose I now needed to go and count bagels in the window so I don't order more than they have. He seemed annoyed.

I'm sorry that bothered him, but how can I know how many of each I can order if I can't see how many are there? I don't know why they take orders at the register instead of at the bagel viewing case, but I really don't feel like it's unreasonable for me to want to stand where I can see the options instead of walk back and forth counting bagels and ordering.

He reluctantly walked over to the bagel area with me. I told him I would take all 6 of the asiago bagels they had. I had wanted more but since there's no stock in the back that's what I would settle for.

He responsibly walked over and asked the people making sandwiches if they would need any of the 6 asiago bagels. Nobody claimed them. He took them all out for me and I ordered some plain ones and a pretzel one to finish my box. He again seemed annoyed when I asked that my bagels be sliced.

Just so we are clear, it's not like they have to slice each one with a knife by hand. They have a magical bagel slicing chute where they just throw each one down this tube and they come out sliced.

As he was slicing my bagels, one of the people making a sandwich told him that they need one of the asiago bagels out of my box. Yes...this was a person who had JUST been asked if they needed any of the asiago ones before he got them for me and nobody seemed to.

So now he takes one of my asiago bagels out and tells me that he's sorry but I'll have to choose something else. I considered walking out right then and going to my normal Einstein location at this point. But then he offered me a six cheese \"gourmet\" bagel. I look in the case to find out what that looks like and I can't find one so I ask. He looks around and guess what? He can't find one either. Turns out they're out of those as well. Of course... 

The only reason this is a 2-star review and not a one-star is that I asked if I could just get a green chile bagel even though they are gourmet as well. He agreed, and even threw in a 2nd green chile bagel for all the trouble.

At the register, he made sure to let me know that normally a green chile bagel cost more but that I would not be paying that because it was his fault. I appreciate the gesture, but paying $0.60 less or whatever it is for a gourmet bagel really wasn't worth the negative aspects of my experience at this location. I guess I'll stick with the one I normally go to. I'll just try to show up sooner so they aren't out of everything."}
{"text":"Nasty. Got an egg wrap and the eggs are so cold they're bordering frozen.

Person who took my order was friendly. Person who prepared and served my food was as cold as the eggs."}
{"text":"The dude that took our order was so cute and sweet!



 And I love bagels so damn much."}
{"text":"I just realized I have not been too one of these places in a year. Last two times they cut the bagel wrong.  And gave me an attitude when I asked them to fix it.  It's my money and u want it my way if I'm paying.  Se e review I left at two other locations.  The guy here was cool and did his job right and my meal was awesome.  While Einstein isn't my favorite its damn good"}
{"text":"Attaching picture. Cut was not even and there is a black edge on the bagel. The amount of cream cheese is extremely tiny. Would it kill them to put more than a tiny thin layer of creamcheese on the bagel. And cut it down the center straight. What else does a bagel place really have to do"}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place an updated review, it's deserved as it's been years.  The good and the bad about the place now.

Bad: They always seem to be out of the types of bagels that I want.  I understand if you go in at 2pm close to closing time but at 10am you're out already, really?  The Good: They have always been willing to make me whatever kind of bagel I wanted, as long as I was willing to wait the 15 minutes to get it.

Good: They don't seem to be busy the last 5 times I've been there. I can usually walk right up to order.  Which because it's so dead could be what's contributing to them not being in stock with bagels.  Why would you want to make them if no one is buying them.

Good: Plenty of parking everywhere, even before they became dead there was plenty of parking.

Bad: Their coffee drinks are really expensive and the 3 kinds that I've tried did not taste good.  This is coming from a coffee addict who would have no problem snorting a line of ground coffee and shooting espresso into her veins.  I'm pretty sure if I stopped drinking coffee my heart would stop beating.  It's possibly the only thing that keeps me alive.  I'll drink house coffee, circle K coffee, starbucks coffee, you name anywhere I'll love it because it's coffee. Iced, hot, dripped, doing the Macarena frap whip topped w/ and extra shot of oh hell yeah that's so good.  Just coffee is amazing!!!  But I will not buy it from here, it's yucky.  Just stick with their bagels and cream cheeses.

Good: Cream cheeses to go! I love their honey, strawberry, and plain flavors, I buy them all the time to go.  And there is plenty of spaces to sit since it's so empty there all the time.

Bad: It's empty all the time, meaning they'll possibly end up shutting down pretty soon here if they don't get business numbers up.  Either they are dying out or I've just happened to always go on days and times that no one else is there.

But anyway, go there yourself and make your own judgement."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible. I went to this particular store today. I noticed they were out of many of bagel types and had at least six people working up front. Unfortunately they were very slow in getting out orders. I ordered two breakfast sandwiches and waited almost 20 minutes. The majority of the customers in the establishment were also waiting for their orders and equally frustrated. After waiting for 10 minutes, one of the employees said they were out of the specific bagel (for the sandwich) and to pick another type.  Even after that, I had to wait an additional 9 minutes."}
{"text":"I was greatly disappointed in the entire staff during my visit. Extremely poor customer service. It wasn't busy whatsoever and I waited, waited and waited at the counter visit in clear view. NO one acknowledged my presence although each employee and I had direct eye contact. Unsure what they were doing that they couldn't greet, welcome or say hello, we'll be with you in a moment (if they were occupied). No apology for the wait, NO smile. I didn't feel welcomed or comfortable here. 

However, this unpleasant experience gets much WORSE with discovering the TRASH and filth throughout this business. Tables are dirty, not wiped down and the floors completely TRASHED with GARBAGE behind the bagel counter, food display. Trash all over the floor and with the overstaffed of employees not one person bothered to take responsibility to pick up and have the area cleaned including the on staff management! Due to disregard of employees and management with poor cleanliness, I would highly divert consumers to another location or similar business. It was absolutely disgusting. There is NO excuse for the actions of these employees and why this food business is being dumped on with garbage from its own staff, representatives that I repeatedly witnessed.

I regret purchasing my meal here, since I discovered this afterwards and it ended up being tossed out. I am not taking any chances with getting ill from this place. Time for a thorough cleanup of this place, including cleaning out all of its employees who don't give a damn, including management! Corporate has been formally informed. I would hope after my negative experience along with that of a fellow Yelper, Casey K. Corporate takes this seriously and does unannounced regular drop-ins at this store location because this is a serious health issue that I believe the public health services need to intervene on if this continues."}
{"text":"Stopped in since I was in the area not pleased at all. The over all customer service was horrible. The young lady at the register was to busy smacking her gum. Yes chewing gum disgusting. (Chewing while talking )  Also I apologize for being a bother and her having to stop her conversation w Co workers to take my order."}
{"text":"I'm going to give Einstein Bros. 4 stars, even though I wasn't thrilled with my Ancho Chicken Wedge. It was my fault thought - I was being virtuous and chose from their under 400 calorie line, when I should have just gone for what I really wanted. Case in point, my boyfriend's turkey on a jalapeno cheese bagel was great. My \"wedge\" was really just a triangular wrap with gooey, spicy cheese. Actually, now that I think about it, it really should have been called a quesadilla. 

The menu is more limited than Panera, but I love their bagels and all the shmears - especially the honey almond. I also have to come back to try some of their drinks which look especially calorific! If they had locations in the Bay area and free wifi, this place would be getting pretty close to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Einstein Bros. For quite a while. However, this location does not seem to get it. I had a really simple order (Bagel toasted well and shmear) with a coffee. My bagel was barely toasted let alone toasted well. It wasn't even browned around the edges. I kindly asked if it they could make my order \"toasted well\" or double toasted and the worker asked if I wanted to throw my bagel under the toaster to cook it some more. It already had cream cheese on it, were they just gonna cook the cream cheese too??  I asked for a new bagel and got another one toasted the same way. C'mon people! I just dealt with it. It tasted like a 2 day old bagel and the coffee was luke warm at best. I just don't care for this location.  I've been to many other locations and never had any issues. It's a management issue!"}
{"text":"Service is not that great here compared to other locations. We were not even asked if we want our bagels toasted, we were also skipped several times because cashier couldn't figure out how to ring us up but what made this visit not so great is just the lack of enthusiasm, maybe it's just me but a smile or a greeting would be nice. I asked for a plate but got one with a dash of sarcasm. Bagels we ordered were the spinach Florentine which is served better on other locations, this one was dry!  I guess we'll give other locations a try but definitely would skip this one."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the service is pretty incredible. Don't get me wrong, it can get pretty packed at this location, but I try to come a little later than most so I don't have to deal with the rush. The food is also phenomenal. Get the Green Chile Club, thank me later."}
{"text":"Terrible 

They constantly make the order wrong, the wait is excessive and he owner/operator is apparently not interested in the success of the store. As much as we love the breakfast sandwiches, we will drive 30 minutes to avoid this store."}
{"text":"Great service and the staff greet you with a great attitude and smile!  Super friendly at 7am. Love the roasted asiago bagel with Sun died tomato shmear! The kid that sells papers by the door, opens the door for you (buy a paper from him:)). We love this location! The only one we go to."}
{"text":"I like this Einstein Bros. It's fairly large and clean. I was anxious to try the new Honey-Glazed Salmon Bagel. It came with chive Shmear, diced tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers, and chopped salmon. I got to choose the bagel so I went for plain so as not to overwhelm the tastes of the toppings. It was really good even though the salmon kept jumping off the bagel. Oh well, that's what forks are for! I ordered the fruit cup on the side as usual, and, as usual, it was nice and fresh!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I love the breakfast items. Try the Sante Fe, just let that sucker cool down for a bit or you will suffer the wrath of molten lava in your mouth. The coffee is cheap and really good, especially the vanilla hazelnut. The customer service seem to be a little slow as you can wait at the register for a while before someone acknowledges you. Here's a hint Einstein if you read these.. designate one cashier and they stay there."}
{"text":"Best service ever received ! Quick and they got my order right every time. Coffee is great and they are not shy with the cream cheese . Very pleasant and genuine professional attitudes. The cashiers were fast and friendly ."}
{"text":"So I've been going to Einstein Bros bagels for YEARS and have generally had what I would call \"4 star\" experiences.  The restaurants are always clean, the service prompt and friendly and the bagels (I almost always get a tasty turkey on a toasted everything bagel).

Yesterday, I dropped into this location hungry & ready for my usual.  The restaurant was PACKED, no biggie, I've seen this before, these guys are bagel slingin pros and will make short work of this line....

So, I step up to the order counter, look into the case & notice they're running low on some varieties but have what I'm looking for.  I order and make my way to the register.  This is where I notice they're set up kinda backwards.  You enter the queue on the left of the store, order and move to the right to pay.  The cashier is next to the restroom and drink machines (a dead end) but then you have to go BACK int the queue where people are ordering to GET your food... Not an issue if the store isn't busy but when all tables are occupied and there's a line to the door, it's kind of a mess.

Every minute or so, an name is called and a bagel lover gets his/her breakfast, everything's in order then right, well.... About every second name called seemed to result in the patron approaching the counter to get his/her order only to be told they'd run out of their bagel choice and would have to choose another.  After 15 minutes waiting for MY name to be called, the moment came and I stepped up to the counter and was told they didn't have any everything bagels and I would have to choose something else.  My response, you had plenty when I ordered, the response \"well, we're out now and people are waiting behind you so hurry up and pick something else.\"  This kinda pissed me off so I looked at the case and said I'll have a garlic bagel, \"if you have any left when you make my sandwich.\" Yes, I was snarky but so was the bagel maker.  The blonde girl next to him seemed offended that I would have anything to say about the goings on and stopped making sandwiches to make sarcastic comments to the guy who was making my bagel.  

Anyway, 5min later I got my order and we headed home.  I opened my bag and inside was NOT a garlic bagel, it was NOT toasted but it WAS an okay onion bagel.  

Maybe I'm overreacting but I don't feel like making bagels is THAT difficult nor do I think it's too much to crank up bagel production when you're slammed on a Saturday (5-11-13) morning...."}
{"text":"Seriously how hard is it to read the order board and make the bagels? Pretty hard. We went here last weekend on our break from work, I ordered a poppy seed bagel with strawberry cream cheese. The girl making it put garden cream cheese on the LAST poppy bagel then realized she messed up and threw it away right in my face then turned looked at me and said oh we don't have any poppy seed bagels left. Uhm no you did have the bagel i wanted you just messed up and now instead of asking me if id like the garden vegetable spread she just threw it away. Then today we went in our our break my BFF ordered a tasty turkey with NO cream cheese extra mayo. The same girl made the sandwich i literally watched her put cream cheese on the sandwich and when we asked her if it was mayo or cream cheese she said cream cheese we told her we didn't want cream cheese so she threw the WHOLE sandwich in the garbage. We live in las vegas they should deff be donating all the mess ups from this girl we could feed a lot of people here on that waste. And also it was not busy in there I can deff understand if they were rushing or there was a huge line..."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great coffee and great food.  Consistent quality and quick service even when they get busy.  Surprisingly, they have some really tasty sandwiches for lunch as well.  I really like that even when I roll in at 6am, the staff might not be fully awake but they are definitely fully engaged."}
{"text":"What can I say, absolutely love Einstein Bros Bagels. Haven't had a bad experience here and am here at least once a week. No matter what location I go to, very consistent and always friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location of Einstein's and Einstein's is my favorite fast food restaurant.  The menu items are generally excellent and once you learn the menu there is something for about every taste. This location has uniformly friendly and helpful employees, is well stocked with bagels, even in the afternoon, and has excellent beverages.  The organization of the order/payment line could use some improvement, but that seems to be a company problem rather than a problem with this specific location."}
{"text":"I'm not too sure why this Einstein Bros location has such terrible reviews, but every time my boyfriend and I are in Vegas we make sure to get our favorite Asiago bagels in the morning. The staff is always friendly and the bagels are always fresh. The only reason why I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because there have been a couple of times when we've gone and there was no Asiago bagels left."}
{"text":"Wow! A few months back I had a very negative experience at this location, but this morning I gave them another chance, as we were returning from the dog park, starving for some bagel toppers.
First of all, the young woman taking orders today at 8:20 was great! Very helpful. I was politely instructed to head over to the register to pay, and I was greeted with a warm smile and a senior discount was automatically applied!! The food was delivered rapidly by another smiling young person.
This location either has new management or something significant happened to remove the dark and dreary unhappiness of the team last time I stopped in.
Well done, Bagel People!! Keep up the great customer care!!"}
{"text":"Store was freezing. Us and every customer after us had to change their orders because they were out of something. Some customers just left the store. If it were 10 minutes until closing time, I might have understood. But, they had hours until they closed. Food was good, but the last 3 times I have gone to this restaurant there have been issues/problems."}
{"text":"8:10am on a Sunday morning and they have run out of plain bagels. We keep coming back because I like the vanilla hazelnut coffee, but I'm going to have to concede. Panera will get our breakfast business from now on. I'll have to make coffee at home. 

There is always something out/broken at this store"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of reading one star reviews for big chain fast food joints. You guys crack me up!!!! 

I've been here four times in the last week. Every time I've seen different staff and had a pretty decent experience. 

I'm pregnant and I crave bagels. They give me bagels. I like that. 

My two year old daughter likes getting a \"pink bagel\" (strawberry shmear) 

My biggest criticism is the lack of care for the dining area. The tables are all wobbly and haven't been consistently wiped down. But I mean, no big deal, just grab a napkin and swipe the crumbs and eat your dang bagel."}
{"text":"Trader Joes, fro yo, nail salon, restaurants, a wine bar, shopping, soon-to-be drug store and now a bagel shop. Yes, this area absolutely needed the bagel shop addition! This is a pretty general Einstein Bagels but it's clean, in a good area, has friendly staff and the bagels are fresh and tasty! 

I really like how Einstein Bagels added thin bagels to their menu. I love their bagels but they can be to hearty for a breakfast, so the thin bagel is a great option. I also enjoy the bagel bites and bagel sandwiches (breakfast and lunch) as well. The cream cheeses are creamy and delicious, especially the honey almond cream cheese. My favorite bagel is the cinnamon sugar bagel. They also have great soda drinks, coffee, fruit, parfait and juices. 

There isn't much more to say other than that this is a perfect addition to the area and I'm happy to have an Einstein's close by for my morning breakfast urges."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of recent experience at this store. 8 times in the last 2 months. On several of those days including this morning they just didn't bake bagels. They always have excuses. I don't know how this could be acceptable to them. To make it worse only half my order was in the bag, and the French toast breakfast sandwich I ordered had veg cream cheese on it!?!? This company needs to change their whole culture. This happens because the company thinks it is acceptable."}
{"text":"Great service love their yogurt parfait with fresh fruit"}
{"text":"the food was excellent here.  however, the cashier zackry was very obnoxious. he was giving me a hard time paying. he kept asking for my ID to order. then he proceeded to ask me what I ordered for breakfast. I didn't tell him the \"exact\" name of the signature bagel I ordered so he kept giving me a hard time. then he asked if I had enough money on my card to pay, which isn't his business. obviously I would have money to pay if I ordered food. overall, I wouldn't go back because of zackry. he was very unprofessional."}
{"text":"They have fresh bagels and a friendly staff. Too bad they don't offer a military discount."}
{"text":"I came here on my lunch break because I had a coupon for buy one get one free. I figured, why not let me check this place out. There was only 1 other customer there. I went up front and asked if I would enable to order a skinny bagel with the coupon and she said yes so I placed my order. Her response was I'm sorry but my computer is down. I asked does that mean I can't place an order? She said yes. Well you'd think she would of told me that when I was asking questions not when I'm ready to place an order. I look down at her name tag and realize she's a shift manager. She said she's be right back she would go in the back and get me a coupon for 2 free sandwiches for my next visit. As I'm standing there I'm thinking to myself you're going to get coupons for 2 free sandwiches then why can't you just give them to me now an place them in your computer when it comes up. You'd rather have me walk out and take the chance of me not coming back. I get that things go down and it was unexpected but I never expected that you'd just let me leave without placing an order. 

I still want to go back and try it out so I will update this review when I do"}
{"text":"Stay away from this location and take the extra drive to the thunderbird location. Employees were all wearing gloves ( which is fine!) but not when one girl is continually touching her hair with her gloves on. While another gentlemen rang me up with his gloves on, made me think those making the food with gloves on did they change the trash with them in, go to the bathroom with them on. It's gross and unsanitary ! I specifically came to this location because of the coupon I received. Well I wanted the avocado breakfast sandwich ( no yolk). And guess what .... no avocados! 3 of there sandwiches have avocado.. well that's annoying. We should of left! But instead decided to still order something else. So order other items and come home. Ugh! When we get home open our sandwiches, there not toasted nor cut in half,  barely any ingredients.. just a total disappointment. Never again."}
{"text":"Horrible service to start! I had to interrupt two employees' personal convo of giggling to ask where I can order (we were not welcomed upon entry). The wait was super long for our order, since they kept giving us our items one-by-one. I had to remind the drink maker of my request for kids-temperature on one of our drinks, they forgot to give us one of our food items. I added a shot of espresso to my drink, still have heavy eye lids hours later, where's the caffeine???

I've been to this location three times, each time has been very unpleasant. The food quality is the only reason the review isn't one star..."}
{"text":"When in the mood for bagels I go to Einstein's with my several year old yellow Einstein Brothers stainless coffee mug.  I pick up an AZ Republic and order a toasted good grains bagel with garden veggie.  I usually have the bagel in a basket by the time I get to check out or at worst when I am filling the coffee mug.  The coffee is mellower than my usual Starbucks but compliments the bagel.  Einstein's draws both the young and mature and I enjoy the ability to read the paper at my leisure either inside or outside in the morning shade."}
{"text":"Bagels are fresh and warm. I was needing a dozen and they were out of chocolate chip and nicely offered to make some fresh. I waited and it was worth it. Good service, good food and a guarentee ill return"}
{"text":"I hold our local Einstein in very high regard. I love the taste of their mocha because it isn't too sweet. I do wish that there were discounts on reusable cups for mixed drinks as there are at Espresso Royale, for example, but I'll live. If you were to get regular coffee there would be a discount, so that's good. I haven't tried any of their other mixed drinks but I do wish they had more variety (although variety equals confusion and right now that mocha is really near perfection!).

I have yet to be disappointed by any food that I have ordered. The lox are delicious, the thin slice BLT is also delicious, as is any bagel with any shmear. It is disturbing that two separate people found what is likely synthetic fibers in their fruit cups. I feel sympathetic to those who this happened to, but I'm not a big fan of purchasing fruit cups because a) they are expensive (and I eat fruit at home) and b) they are wet, so they pick stuff up... such as pubes or synthetic fibers.

The suspected pube issue aside, I love Einstein. Love, love, love!"}
{"text":"Einsteins has great food but the cashiers consistently act like what I order is an inconvenience. Customer service training would be helpful! :)"}
{"text":"Met a friend this morning at 10am.  I was going to pick up a bagel and then get my coffee next door at Starbucks, but I saw that Einsteins has an iced coffee carafe with refills so I just got my coffee here.  

It wasn't busy.  Bagel was tasty.  My drink was empty so I went up to refill my cup but the carafe was empty.  I went to the counter and let the guy know that there was no more iced coffee.  He tells me that he'll take care of it.

I wait about 7-8 minutes and walk up to fill my cup... But it's still empty.  I remind the guy that there is no coffee and he says he'll take care of it.  

I go back to my seat and talk some more with my friend.  I go back about 5-6 minutes later assuming that the ice coffee is ready... But still nothing.  

This time I go to a different employee and ask him if it's normal to wait 15 minutes for a refill of coffee.  His response is a shrug of the shoulders and \"sorry\".  

Finally 10 minutes later as we are leaving, they start brewing the ice coffee.  

Poor service.  And extremely pathetic response to a customer issue.  Is nobody there empowered to say anything other than \"sorry, we'll take care of it\"????"}
{"text":"Dutch Apple Bagel w/honey cream cheese:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pYMVEUmjK4tkKr1wn0ne3A?select=BkppKCqAGpbXvPcJvRYx1A

Toasted of course.

Arguably my favorite bagel I've eaten.  Thought the dutch apple+honey cream cheese would be too much sweetness, but surprisingly it wasn't.  Size was decent and easily tied down my appetite for a few hours.  

Bonus:  free wi-fi and unlimited coffee refills."}
{"text":"Came here in the afternoon to check it out. Told the person behind the counter that it was my first time and she gladly explained. I ordered the jalapeño bagel with chive cream cheese and expected to pay right there. She said we have to go to the other end to pay. That seemed weird but she also had to go to the other end to ring me up. This seems really confusing and inefficient for all involved. I understand picking up the order at the other end but this was weird. Also it makes no sense as you could actually have 4 registers for the busy time.

The bagel choices are great but they were out of almost everything. The bagel I had was good and I would come back if I was nearby but would not make a special trip.

I should also mention that they are really friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Used to frequent this place - the bagels are my favorite! But the last few times, particularly this one, we were very disappointed. We ordered coffee with cream, for home and it was black. Then we opened the bagels and they were smashed smashed. And hardly any cream cheese. This will make us think twice before visiting again."}
{"text":"The bagels are always fresh and tasty here.  I LOVE Einstein's coffee, and the bottomless cup that you serve yourself.  My favorite thing about Einstein's is the selection of coffees.  They always have a seasonal roast available (right now it's Autoumn Roast, and it's de-lish!)  Thania and her store's staff are always very friendly.  I love sitting on the tall chairs in front of the window reading or doing my homework.

The only down sides to this store is that it's a bit small, and even if there was wi-fi, there's not an outlet to be found other than the one right by the east door (and they probably wouldn't really dig me plugging in and creating a tripping/lawsuit hazard).  Other than that, a great place to chill and get some great coffee."}
{"text":"So maybe I went into Einstein Bros with high expectations, but wow was it a let down. I went in on a Saturday morning and there was a giant crowd, but the line went by relatively quickly so yay! My friend ordered a Santa Fe (Cage-Free Eggs, Turkey-Sausage, Pepper Jack Cheese with
Roasted Tomato Salsa and Jalapeño Salsa Shmear on an
Asiago Bagel) while I got avocado toast on an everything bagel. I was blindly optimistic about the avocado and figured it'd be a healthy alternative to cream cheese. Now, the bagels themselves were overly chewy. I'm all for having chewy bagels, but these were so bad that it was cumbersome to eat them. On top of that, my avocado toast had maybe 2-3 spoonfuls of avocado max. It was honestly such a sad amount of avocado for the high price tag. I do have to note that this location was somewhat dirty as others have noted. This place could work for you if you love a really chewy bagel. If you don't, I'd say you should steer clear and check out another bagel place."}
{"text":"First they got my order wrong (#4 breakfast combo). It involved crediting my CC back, me signing something, then recharging my CC.  Which is fine. Then, they rushed out the breakfast sandwich to me, and I had to ask about my fruit cup and coffee which was included. They're coffee was weak sock water!  As soon as I saw it, I poured it out.  I drank they're \"dark roast\", because it looked semi decent.  Plus they serve egg sandwiches and there's no ketchup?!  The one at the Hyatt iss way better.  Overall an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Love this place! The chocolate chip bagels are my favorite and have been since I was a kid! The workers are all very nice here and it's a great location. Always leave this place happy and they do a great deal on Monday's for a bakers dozen bagels."}
{"text":"I didn't have a chance to see a review for this location.  We were in the neighborhood, and I was hungry for breakfast.  And when hunger strikes, I'd rather get food instead of drive thru.

The egg sandwich with spinach was fair. My stomach was thinking eggs, my brain and taste buds received something either out of a carton or space food.  Whatever it may have been, I'd recommend not this, unless you are a fan of MRE's or would like to know what they eat when floating around in space.  Everything else was good, though I wanted the main course, my egg sandwich to be great, or at least good.  So the brownie for dessert made everything better.  Chocolate is the way to go when you want a happy ending.

The good is pet friendly, with outside seating, and open space patio.  You can even buy a doggie bagel inside.  A little round something that you have to step on to break apart unless you have a larger dog."}
{"text":"Bagel poppers...where have you been all my life? I want one. No, more like five hundred.  I think I ate five throughout the day after a gigantic lunch and the only thing that saved me from complete morbid obesity was that other dentists equally addicted to sweets were there and they vanished. I sampled two boxed lunches and loved the turkey bagel sandwich. The club had a spicy funky dressing I wasn't ready to jazz with but the dessert made more than up for that. The chocolate chip cookies were still slightly warm and fantastic! Then the bagel poppers: luscious soft cinnamon sugar enveloped bagels melting like a donut in your mouth. When I came home I quickly announced to the boyfriend I have a new favorite food. You can guess what it is."}
{"text":"Hot bagel, shmatbagel, Their plain bagels have nothing on these. Asiago cheese is my fav but all are so nice and chewy and this is from someone who makes their own bagels for fun and lived in NYC for a bit. Their honey almond cream cheese inspired many \"at home mixes\" to replicate. Nothing can match the delicious whipped goodness. Also a fan of the strawberry, blueberry, well pretty much all the cream cheeses and bagels. If they weren't so delicious I would be a little more embarrased I ate 2 and 1/2 at a volunteer brunch yestaurday!"}
{"text":"I love the food at Einstein's but the service has been poor on several occasions. I have received the wrong food, cold coffee, had to repeat my order several times, the register was down, the cappuccino machine was down several times, and the wait time is horrible. The system they have in place to take & prepare your orders is very bad. People behind you can often get their food before you do. It seems like a poor management problem. The employees are very nice but don't seem to be very well trained."}
{"text":"I think that this Einstein's is one of the better ones in the area, this one is further then the other Einstein's but the always have the bagels stocked and the staff here is great.  

I usually go in the morning and my favorite bagel is the 6 cheese bagel, which seems to be almost everyone's favorite as well.  They are always pretty low on the 6 cheese bagels and some other popular bagels.  

I usually get the tasty turkey bagel sandwich and I change the bagel to a 6 cheese bagel.  They toast it and the cheese just melts to perfection.  In the morning the have freshly squeezed orange juice and it taste really refreshing.  They also have coffee, but I am personally not a big fan of it ( not strong enough lol).  Their menu has a pretty wide variety considering its all bagels, but there is pizza bagels to club sandwiches.

Overall the place is very well kept up, its always clean and the staff at this place are very nice! I will always keep coming back to this Einstein's!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Einstein location I've ever been to. There are like 6 people working behind the counter and no one seems to know what is going on. I stood there for at least 5 minutes before someone even bothered to take my order. They have these huge signs all around the store advertising their cold brew so I ordered but when I went to pay they said they didn't have any. When I asked if they just had plain iced coffee, they told me they got rid of it for the cold brew. Which they don't have. So dumb. Now I am drinking this nasty iced latte with soy milk. And the service is sooooo slow. Ugh what a mistake coming here. Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"Good bagel place that never disapoints.  However, if you are in the neighborhood, I would recommend Nosh on Warner and 48th over Einstein."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for as long as I can remember. It seems though over the years it has lost it's edge. Every time I go in they are ALWAYS out of the bagels I want. They are the more expensive bagels but I always have to settle for the cheaper ones. I've voiced my opinion about them always being out all the time but it never seems to change. 

On a visit about a month ago, I heard three staff members complaining about the manager of the store. For a good 15 minutes. It was getting so bad that I almost got out of my chair and approached them but I didn't want to cause a scene. It's not professional and quite frankly, a little disheartening. 

Maybe one day they will fix the issues they are having but in the meantime, I will continue to support this business for the one or two staff members that do their job and have good customer service.

Update: They have improved quite a lot the last few months. I am not sure if it was staff changes or if they have been reading reviews, but they have improved. Good job guys."}
{"text":"I gone to this location which is nearby me twice and unfortunately had to experience poor customer service experience and lack of common courtesy on both occasion. I normally would go to the one on S Decatur and Sahara some mornings with my granddaughter where their servicing and customer service has been nothing but friendly and professional.  I had expected same experience on this W Flamingo location BUT it was very unfortunate that they had a customer and myself waiting on line to order while 3 people are walking about behind the counter like we were invisible???  2nd time I stopped by to get a bagel I was rudely ignored and bypass by the attendant who decided to care for the customer who just had walked in to ask some question while I'm standing in the front waiting to order! That was unacceptable for lack of customer service. I just simply walked out of there and drove 10 mins to the Sahara and S. Decatur location to get my bagel.

I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS W FLAMINGO LOCATION AGAIN! DON'T CARE HOW CLOSE TO ME IT IS!!  I RATHER MAKE THE EXTRA TRIP TO A LOCATION THAT CARES TO CATER AND SERVE THEIR CUSTOMERS RESPECTFULLY!  THAT'S WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ALL ABOUT SOMETHING THIS LOCATION LACKS ON AMONG THEIR MORNING STAFF!!  UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT!!!"}
{"text":"This place is always slammed and I don't mind waiting in the line. Everyones helpful and friendly. The manager has said hi to me every time since I moved to AZ a year and half ago. They are quick, efficient and the bagels are amazing. Its attached to a starbucks so I usually order my drinks there and then head over for bagels... by then your drinks are ready. We will never stop coming back!"}
{"text":"It was my first time ever trying Einstein bagels. I got the egg sandwich (mushroom, egg and Swiss). Was delicious! The bagels were extremely fresh. The staff here is very friendly and helpful. Oh and they have great coffee! (Try the Hazelnut vanilla)."}
{"text":"I almost forgot to leave a review for this place. Too bad negative stars isn't possible. I normally love Einsteins. This was my first time going to this location. I got a yogurt parfait and ordered a blueberry bagel bagel, toasted and lightly smeared. As I was approaching the register to pay I noticed the guy making my bagel ever so slightly rub his ass as if he were brushing something off of him. Nice. Wtf is wrong with some people. I had a similar experience at a Jimmy Johns. These fucking people think because they wear gloves they can touch anything and it's fine. Clearly they don't realize they defeat the whole purpose of wearing gloves by touching whatever, wherever, and continuing on as normal. It's so gross and disgusting. For someone to nonchalantly touch their dirty ass pants while making something someone is going to eat. People sit everywhere, pants are almost as gross as the bottom of a shoe. I'm sure he does things like this all the time for how easy it was for him to do it. If you see a young thin white guy with shaggy hair and a full Amityville horror dad beard, watch him closely so he doesn't contaminate your food. Then they were surprised when I got to the register and cancelled my order. No thanks on ass bagels."}
{"text":"Got a Italian Chicken Bagel Sammie, chips, choc chip cookies-in-a-cup, and a big Fiji water for lunch.  The Sammie was meh...a bit greasy (had basil pesto).  The chips and cookies were good! Service was good and efficient.  I'd go for the normal toasted bagel and shmear next time."}
{"text":"Worst Einstein Bagel as far as service , cleanliness, and product availability.  Out of everything took so long to get food etc"}
{"text":"I love this location because it's right on my way to work... I had a breakfast sandwich here once that I wasn't too fond of  so now I just get the regular bagels - the spinach florentine is my fave. 

The lines can get kind of long here in the morning, but the staff so far has done a good job not making everyone wait too long. Nothing worse than having employees who don't give a rat's ass, so I'm glad it's not the case here. In fact, everyone has been really nice here always saying good morning and smiling...at least every time I've been here."}
{"text":"We were the only customers and the cashier - don't remember her name but was Shift Leader - was rude and impatient. The whole staff looks unhappy. 3 stars cause it's hard to mess up a bagel

{"text":"Einstein is a great establishment and the bagels are great
My last visit was a nice one as I stopped in for a light lunch
The cashier was very friendly and helpful as I had a hard time making up my mind
I ended up choosing the deli sandwich on a wheat bagel and I also got a fruit cup and some tea...
My bagel sanny turned out to be very yummy and got a ton of likes on instagram
:)
It was very clean and just calm inside of Einstein on this lovely Sunday morning"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. So, there's that. Now, let me get to the point. When it comes to bagels. I only ever eat the lox bagel. Most bagel shops I have been to are generous with their salmon they place on my bagel--at least to the point in which the top half of my bagel is covered by lox. Every time I have been to an Einstein's, they skimp me hardcore on the lox. They are generous with two giant pieces of red onion on each side and capers, and cream cheese. With the lox, I got two small slices of lox on each bagel, which left a lot of bare space and threw the taste off. It was very onion heavy without enough lox to balance the sandwich. I was disappointed. This is a reoccurring theme with Einstein's it seems. So, I might take the extra drive to Back East bagels to get me their delicious lox!"}
{"text":"Why do I continue to abuse myself and visit various Einstein locations only to be subjected to disappointment? I stopped by on yesterday afternoon to place a pickup order for the next morning and was told by the cashier that catering can only be ordered online. I was purchasing this for a non-profit and thus needed it to be tax exempt which I couldn't do online. She went to get her manager who took down my order and let me pay so that I wouldn't be slowed down the next morning. She then told me that for future reference I could order online and then call to have it exempted from tax. The place was a ghost town and yet everybody made me feel like placing my order in-store was a huge inconvenience. 
I returned this morning to pick it up and even though I was about 15 minutes early, it was all bagged up and ready to go. I was even helped out to my car, which was nice. However, I don't think I'll be back. I spent over $100 and expect better customer service and not to be made to feel like a burden."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh bagels!!  I live in California, however, when I visit Henderson, NV, Einstein is my 1st and only choice for my bagel fix."}
{"text":"This place is very close to my Apt and I love Einstein Bros Bagels but this one leaves something to be desired. Don't get me wrong the staff really tries....and they are for the most part friendly....but they are unorganized....slow....and seem to be NEVER prepared for huge crowds. Most Einstein Bros Bagel shops I have been to are always busy especially during the morning hours....so there is no excuse for the workers at this locale to expect anything different. The place is also very cramped and that's too bad because the location is not the best to sit outside due to the lack of seating out there as well. Now in a pinch I will come to this location but I usually go to the one on Shea Blvd because it is much better. I really wanted to give this locale 2 stars...but again since the staff does really try and they at least show some effort....I decided to go with 3 stars. I highly recommend they hire more staff or at least get some more efficient people to work there. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Einstein's always has great coupon deals.....and this past Saturday I had breakfast there for only 4 bucks. What did I have you ask? Well I had the Turkey Sausage (which is a huge plus for me ) and egg white bagel sandwich with cheddar cheese on an Asiago bagel. I also had a small coffee to go along with it.....and that includes free refills. This meal would have normally cost me close to 8 bucks and again I only paid 4 bucks...enough said. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"My Sandwich made incorrectly -  wife's bagel wasn't fresh - soda fountain  not working correctly - out of ice tea. This place doesn't get any better.  What makes it even worse is that the employees don't seem to care! Never coming back again!"}
{"text":"You go to a chain b/c you expect the same food, same price, and same experience, right?

Unfortunately, this location has dropped two stars in the last year. This used to be my quick, on-the-way to work stop, and lately it has been SLOW, and DIRTY. Start with the tables - unwiped; to the employees' clothes - filthy; to the tiles missing off the wall - neglect. 

Even the \"older\" gentleman with the accent now seems defeated. In the midst of the rush, he walked out with his phone for a break? (He used to be so happy, calling out names and handing out orders! ) More employees walked in, in -  yes - dirty uniforms and aprons. YUCK. 

Waited 20 minutes for a single blueberry bagel last Friday around 9 am. Seriously? Going to have to take another route to work to stop for a quick tea or bite."}
{"text":"Not a good experience with this location! Ordered a few things for a morning meeting the day before on line with the catering option, went to pick it up the next morning during my time slot... they hadn't even started to prepare it!! (What's the point of the plan and pay ahead if I still had to wait 10 min?) I was almost late to my meeting when I discovered that the bagels I got were missing the 2 containers of cream cheese- so we had dry bagels. While the woman was filling up my box of coffee, she spilled it all over the opening so when i get to my office the box was pretty much useless and falling apart from being soaked- ended up pouring it into different container. This was my first time ordering online the day before, and my first time at this location (other locations have been fine). I'll probably be getting my order ahead breakfasts from Dunkin' Doughnuts from now on."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and I've never been to an Einstein Bros before, so I thought I'd shake up my breakfast routine a little. 

A bagel? As a sandwich? How exotic!

I ordered the Chorizo Sunrise and man was I overwhelmed. It was bursting with guacamole, some sort of salsa and stuffed into a chile bagel. Definitely a meal and a half more than I was expecting. Delicious though.

Now the coffee. It's my own fault. Rather than get the \"lite\" roast I opted for the vanilla. 

I'm sure there are some people who love the vanilla roast. I do not. Layering a cheap flavor over a roast like that should be grounds for treason. The only cup of coffee I've never finished. Again, this is only a personal preference.

The staff was attentive and friendly despite being early morning. 

I'll return for a plain bagel and coffee, having learned my lesson."}
{"text":"Something about bagels and walking in this place just gets me excited! I'm in love with their low fat berry smoothies, and pesto egg sandwich. I like this locations outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"Good luck getting customer service at this location. Guy takes my order and can't seem to speak at all or look up from the screen. Repeats back an incorrect order and then doesn't confirm the correct one before having the order made. Girl ringing me up says she's been in his position before and when I ask what she meant she says she doesn't know. I ask for the guys name and she said she doesn't know. Does anyone know anything? Manager comes out and as I am telling her why her team is incompetent, the guy is laughing out loud as I am talking. Fantastic customer service guys.... all I wanted was three correct sandwiches, nothing hard."}
{"text":"My favorite is their double shot of espresso in a cup of Melvyn's Dark Roast coffee with steamed cream. A cup of coffee doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Everybody seemed irritated that we even came in the place. And I wish the cashier was wearing some form of identification because he was by far one of the rudest encounters I've had recently. Will not be going back there again."}
{"text":"Oh boy. So here we go again. I told myself I wouldn't go to Einstein's again because every time I go, my order gets messed up. But my wife wanted to go this morning, so we went. 

So they're attitudes were less than spectacular, as always. I know customer service work is not fun, I get it, but give your employees some caffeine or something to pep them up. And normally I wouldn't comment on customer service, but Ev-ery-time they seem miserable. 

Then my order. So, when I asked what came on the sandwich I got, they didn't tell me everything that actually came on it so I had a couple surprises when I opened my sandwich. I ask them to add bacon and mustard, but didn't ask for mayo considering they can literally never get it right, but don't worry they got that. But the icing on the cake this time, as we were sitting in there I smelled a bagel burning. I turned to my wife and snarks, \"oh that's probably mine\".... guess what. It was. 

I have officially drawn the last straw. The food isn't worth it, customer service is lacking, and they are incapable of making an order properly. Sad day."}
{"text":"Always a pleasant and consistent experience.  I come here at least once a week and Rose is typically working.  She is extremely courteous and you can tell is always working with urgency.  Keep up the great work Rose!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty slow and the bagels were BARELY toasted, seemed like they were thrown in the microwave for 10 seconds. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"I love their snickerdoodle cookies, but the cashier who worked on Saturday afternoon (2/15/14) was rude & lacked manners. Overall poor customer service."}
{"text":"Being from NY I always crave bagels when on vacation. Einstein Bros. fits the bill. Only gripe is that their prices are more expensive than NY.  I mean almost $5.00 for a creamcheese bagel and orange juice is a bit pricey. The bagels are also softer than a NY bagel. I like a crispier outside. Regardless of those two things the bagels themselves are good. It has become my standard bagel place every time I am out West."}
{"text":"Service is always above average and the Asiago Turkey is great."}
{"text":"friendly service.  My order took a bit longer than expected but a sincere apology from supervisor made it all good!  Great egg sandwhiches and a very clean store.  Patio seating is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Gate 11 location.  Outstanding, efficient service with a smile.  I did not catch the name of the young woman working the cash register, Saturday June 10, 2018 5:45 am.  She is a gem! Her infectious enthusiasm, smile, and entire demeanor was noticed and noted by everyone with whom she assisted.  Hang on to this one, Einstein, give her a raise and get her training othersothers.  She sets the example for others to follow."}
{"text":"Sunday am Hung Over needing to eat like now. The kids wanted bagels and this was the closet place. I had been here years ago and was surprised to see it is still there. 

The place was not too busy, there were seats available. 

The staff was rude, Shelby the \"manager\" although cute could care less about taking my order. She had pressing issues and had to explain how to mop or sweep or what ever the other dude was doing. I obviously should have waited until they were done. LOL 

The bagels were squished flat like a pancake, although good flavor the thing looked like crap. 

The Hot Choc was 700 degrees and they knew it was for a kid. It was watery until we realized it was because the Choc syrup was pooled in the bottom of the cup. 

The frapachino thing was too sweet for a 13 year old to eat. She tossed over 1/2 of it. 

The Dr Pepper was good. :)"}
{"text":"10am on a Saturday morning. All bagels are out and staff is useless! Who owns this place? They should be ashamed of themselves!"}
{"text":"The new leaner breakfast sandwiches are good (they basically take the bottom and top of the bagel and you are left with smaller ends of your sandwich). An easy way to cut calories without losing the taste."}
{"text":"The food is good, but lately the service has been terrible. On one visit, they gave me my food but forgot my drink. I went back up to get the drink and it took over five minutes before they even acknowledged me.  After that, it took almost 20 minutes to make a mixed coffee drink. No apologies or sympathy.

I decided to go again today (forgetting my previous experience) and walked up to the ordering area. The employee who takes the orders was completely consumed by a conversation she was having with a friend.  The other employee was making some food and also did not notice me waiting.  After some time, she took my order and I went to the cashier. No one was there. I stood around for a few minutes and the other employee finally walks by just to tell me he'll be with me soon. Soon, I guess, meant another five minutes.

The whole time while I was waiting,  the two employees and friend continue their conversations and laughter as they work slowly. I was the only person in line and it took waaaay too long to get one sandwhich.

I really feel like the employees at this location don't care about customer service and are more concerned with socializing and having fun. Definitely not coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"My wife and I go to this Einstein's every Sunday and the service is always fast.  The staff is friendly. My wife loves the coffee there and I love their sandwiches.  A bit pricey but that is expected.  If you fill out the survey on the receipt, you get a free drink, time and time again.  The manager of this restaurant is always in the front making sure her staff is doing the right thing."}
{"text":"I love going to Einsteins for breakfast! I used to work for them for about 1 1/2 years, and every time I go I get greeted still like I'm an employee there. They know my order exactly every time, know my name, treat me well, bring my order to the table, and satisfy my needs! Love this place, and will continue to go for breakfast all the time! Thanks Wendy, you're an excellent boss and thank you to the staff, including Dani, Leah, Tina, Mickey, and the rest of you!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service here this morning AND the bagel. Waited a long time to order while the cashier flirted with a girl at the register. When another girl sauntered out from the back there was no apology for the wait.  Then had to wait an extra lengthy time for my bagel. I asked for a toasted and it was barely warm. This location only has three stars and I can see why. Apparently Einstein corporate doesn't read yelp or just doesn't care. Have to find a new bagel place. Perhaps the grocery store next-door. It would probably be better"}
{"text":"Tracy and the manager, didn't catch his name, went out of their way to ensure I had a spectacular experience!  They no longer carry the winter blend bags for sale but they got me the bags they brew for the same price
 The manager saw the disappointment on my face  when they said I might be able to find one but doubtful. What a great crew at this store to think outside the box. You have a friend for life!"}
{"text":"I love this location! Sometimes there can be a line but the tend to be pretty fast. My boss always gets the iced americano here which she gets everywhere in az and she says this is in her top 5. I love the bagels here so good!!"}
{"text":"The line is fifteen people deep on a busy Saturday morning. When the woman in front of me reaches the cashier after ordering, she asks the busy cashier (who is making coffee orders and getting people extra accoutrements, etc. Clearly he's ready to pull his hair out), \"Why is there a twenty minute wait?\". I'm thinking to myself, \"Why are Libyan forces conquering Tripoli?\", or \" Why is the sky blue?\". He shrugs and tells her that they have had large orders. No thank you to the cashier, she takes her food and leaves.

The cashier was pleasant to me and I went on my way; quickly grabbing a seat before someone would take one of a few last tables. I forsook grabbing a napkin so as not to loose the table. Six minutes later my Nova Lox Sandwich arrives, far earlier than said. Lox spread on a cheddar cheese toasted bagel with a great amount of lox, tomatoes, capers and red onion. This was worth the wait in line during the busy breakfast rush. I shoved it down my throat, with lox cream cheese probably all over my face due to the forsaken napkin. 

I don't care because now the line is twenty deep and going outside the door. The manager escorts a woman interested in being hired there towards the door next to me. The woman gives the manager her name. Most of the restaurant has rubbernecked to see the manager talking to the woman. Group think: \"please go back to making orders!\". The manager tells the job seeker that she will be going through applications in a week. Although none of my business I'm thinking why would she let a good candidate continue to seek other employment when this place clearly needed help? I'm from a big city and having been a retail manager myself, I personally would have told the woman I would get back to her within the next couple days. Clearly no sense of urgency here, just mentioning it, no stars deducted for perceived inefficiency. 

The woman next to me gets her order delivered to her table. She barks orders at the delivery woman. The customer does not say thank you. I just want to get the heck out there due to the ingratitude of these patrons. Perhaps I'm too sensitive but I notice details, hence a yelper. The bagel was delicious. No warm and fuzziness here but not due to employees. I don't think any place would get five stars during a busy breakfast rush such as this."}
{"text":"Staying at marriot resort and thinking we are in a high end area but this bagel place has the rudest staff ever.  Wont come back here ever again. I rather take my money somewhere that at least they smile at me."}
{"text":"Bagels:  always stick with the pumpernickel and everything bagels. Their lite cream cheese is very good. 
The service person at the register is a CONSTANT bottleneck. I completely agree with the other reviewers who leveled similar complaints. The woman treats the cash register as if she is performing DNA analysis.
I never ask these folks for any bagel preparation whatsoever. I simply buy a half dozen or dozen box, and then wait for the checkout blunder of the day. Today, she gave my bag of bagels to another customer and again could not properly manage checkout for either customer. 
If you do want better service, go to the einsteins on 64th street and greenway."}
{"text":"Went this morning on a busy Saturday and bought bagels,  bagel sandwiches, smoothies and coffee for my six kids, my husband and I. The line was long so I was afraid we would be late for our soccer game (but everyone was hungry). I was blown away by the efficiency of this restaurant.  The blond lady at the cash register was training someone and was fast and accurate and friendly at the same time. As a business owner myself I thought she was a very valuable asset. The order was quickly processed. The line moved fast and our complicated order came out perfect. We were in and out in 5 minutes and enjoyed our breakfast very much. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Check in for a free bagel and cream cheese!

The staff is very friendly. The young man who took my order the first time I was there made some great suggestions and even let me sample some cream cheese before I decided on my order. They have some great breakfast sandwiches also!

Their bagels are DELICIOUS. Oh my god I love bagels. I am going to seriously have to talk myself out of going here every single day.

They also have Wi-fi, so it's a great place to get a warm drink and relax for a bit!"}
{"text":"I'm a firm believer that cooking an egg should take longer than 30 seconds. Also, it should not be formed in a perfectly round and oddly fluffy disk. And warm cheese that doesn't melt is disturbing. And sausage patties shaped to the exact same size as the egg disk is bizarre as well. Food just doesn't exist perfectly in nature like this! It's wrong!

Otherwise, the bagel was alright. Just know that the everything bagel is covered in rye seeds, which is weird. 

The coke from the soda fountain was the best part of the meal. I was wicked hungover."}
{"text":"I am not a really fan of Einstein Bagels.
Once in a while, my company caters lunch from this particular location, so I eat them.

They do a good job preparing in a nice box per person, it is nicely presented, order comes with sweets, they do deliver on time, and their bagels are tasty.

Their sandwich and salads are just okay. I wouldn't go out of my way to look for their store to have their sandwich or salads.  I had almond salad this week.  Green wasn't the freshest, a bit too much of the same kind, could have used different kinds of greens. I think next time I would just stay with sandwich instead. They are more edible.  

I appreciate they do deliver food on time, every time even for a small order."}
{"text":"This place is so close to home and I love Einstein Bros Bagels, just not this one.  The place feels cramped and dirty.  Too bad because I would go here more often if those two things weren't an issue, I guess I could eat outside but I want the choice.  When we ate here the server got our order wrong twice once on the the receipt then when it was made; how does that happen? Oh well, maybe I will visit here again just to see if it improves or maybe I will just have to drive a little further."}
{"text":"Got a multigrain roll instead of the jalapeño cheddar bagel requested. Ate it anyway, as another customer had to go back multiple times to get the correct order and I just wanted to eat. Paid a .55 cent up charge for the special bagel I didn't get. After reading the other reviews of consistent problems with incorrect orders, I've decided I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Worst Einstein bagel location. Place is filthy, poor customer service. Our bagel took more than 10 minutes and it was only a simple toasted raisin bagel. After waiting and they finally called my name, I go to my car and it's the wrong order. I go back in and let them know. The shift leader tells me \" well you took the wrong order, why would you take it \" apparently it's my fault. I asked to speak with a manager which took another 10 minutes of waiting. There was no apology or any acknowledgement of any type that they did wrong. Employees are rude and have no clue what good customer service is."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for Labor Day weekend went in on Saturday at 11:00 am, they had no bagel Everything was empty. I was able to get a cup of coffee at least. I decide to give them another chance on Sunday morning as I am entering the establishment costumers where coming out upset and saying how can a bagel place run out of bagles. Sure enough I going no bagel I wasn't even able to get coffee this time because I was standing there for 10 minutes and no one even acknowledged me. Terrible customer skills. Stay away"}
{"text":"All my friends know my symbiotic relationship with Starbucks -- I throw money and they supply me with happiness in a cup... Well, I've converted. I seemed to have stumbled upon and found myself in a love affair with another. Two of them in fact, called Einstein Bros. I know they've been around forever, but it wasn't until recently I started making this my morning stop for my caffeine hits and freshly baked fare. 

Their coffee's a nice change. It's self-serve and bottomless. They usually have four different roasts: Neighborhood Blend, Neighborhood Decaf, Vanilla Hazelnut, and Melvyn's Dark Roast, which they also use in their iced coffee option. I'm all about iced coffees, but I prefer to make my own using their Neighborhood Blend. One prominent difference from the green mermaid -- no burnt after-taste and for the budget-minded, it's like $2.15. For the coffee snobs, think of it as two notches above McDonald's coffee. 

**Pro tip: Purchase one of their nifty plastic traveler mugs for $2.99, then subsequent visits for coffee refills is only $1.19-- love it!!**

Sign up for Schmear Society to receive special coupons. My welcoming gift was a free bagel and schmear (with any purchase). My favorite bagel is probably the Asiago, but I also like the Spinach Florentine (which has the consistency of a croissant than a bagel). It's good even without schmear, try it warmed instead of toasted. Everything is baked fresh, not coming from plastic wraps or boxes. 

Additionally, this location is a little better than the Sunset/Stephanie one which is super tiny. There's plenty of seating and is a good alternative spot to study until their closing time, which is around 4pm.

PS -- If you're feeling fancy, get their Nova Lox sandwich. So good!"}
{"text":"A bagel shop should have bagels....right? At 845 am this week and 800 am last week, out of nearly everything. Again, your a bagel shop. You definitely need some training in inventory/product management. Won't be wasting my time here again. Oh by the way, you only sell bagels, it shouldn't be that complicated."}
{"text":"This place has some redeeming qualities.  One is the food manager Katie.  She helped me out and I can't thank her enough.  But what blows my mind is that no one, outside of the New York City area, knows what a good freaking bagel is.  You'd think Einstein was the shiznit.  They're not, but I wanted something reliable and I do like their egg sandwiches so I went in to order one while I was on conference (this is right across the street from the conference center).  

Anyway, I place my order, which was nothing too difficult.  Spinach mushroom and cheddar egg sandwich.  When I visited California in 2009, I had a good experience at an Einstein so I tend to gravitate though I think their bagels are shit.  I mean, hey, NYer here in the duh howse.  So anyway, I wait and the guy clearly got confused.  As it took me till I was in the conference room waiting for the presentaiton to start that I realized the ONLY thing they got right in the order was the type of bagel I wanted.  

Now, at that point I would have just taken it and eaten it.  But there was asparagus on it.  Homey don't do asparagus.  So I stormed across the street.  Honestly, I felt bad b/c they were very nice and I just had a bad food experience across the board so far in Phoenix.  I order something so simple and it got fucked up.

So I talked to Katie, the food manager, and she not only personally took care of it, she gave me a ticket to get a free sandwich and coffee on the house.  So I said, all righty then.  I took advantage of it, and while they ran out of spinach (seriously WHAT IS UP WITH PEOPLE IN PHOENIX RUNNING OUT OF GODDAMN FOOD IN FOOD SERVICE), they got my order right and it was delicious.  So in a snap, I know this is here.  But I probably won't be back here for awhile but thanks to Katie - she rocks and the Hyatt (which operates this franchise) should be honored to have her working for them"}
{"text":"We came to get a coffee. We were sitting outside with our dogs. I walked in while my mother in law stayed outside with the 2 dogs. When I was paying for our coffees I saw they had dog bagels I asked for two, he stated by the way if your dog's bark 1 time outside I will come ask you to leave. He was so rude about it and in the mean time they were sitting outside calmly not barking at all. No customer service and not dog Friendly at all even though they sell dog bagels. If I could rate a zero I would so rude"}
{"text":"If you're at Palms Place, you're steps away from reasonably priced breakfast. Toasted everything bagel and bacon-egg-cheese sandwich we got here were exactly as expected and everyone was very friendly. Monday special is something like 13 bagels for $6 if you need to feed your entire hotel floor."}
{"text":"Ok Update..... They still run out of my favorite Bagels a lot but you know what? I find another one I also like. Nice people work here. Favorite bagel is the six-cheese!! Woo Hoo"}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this place. I love the green chile bagel with southwest cream cheese. So good! But, they are usually always out of those bagels. Sometimes I will get a wheat bagel with strawberry cream cheese but the it ALWAYS tastes like onions or something other than strawberry because they never wipe off the knives that the spread it on with. It always has a bad taste and they never put hardly any cream cheese on it to begin with. They are sooooo slow here. You always have to wait for your order. They employees are usually nice and that is never an issue. I love it because it is near where I live and they usually have coupons. The coffee is decent but not great."}
{"text":"This is a convenient place to come in and grab a bagel and some coffee.  I like their breakfast bagel with egg and cheddar cheese.  Even when they are busy they get the food out quickly."}
{"text":"Waiter! There are pubes in my fruit cup.

Thought the pineapple tasted fishy. No, like actual fucking fish. It tasted like a fish in my mouth. Then I found a pube on my cantaloupe. It's been a rough morning. Needless to say, my therapist is not going to be happy about this.

See photos."}
{"text":"My second time here and both times have been great.  A lot of business so can't be so bad as the ratings imply."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. It took the stoner dude behind the counter about 10 minutes to make a sandwich. The only other person working just kind of moves things, from place to place, and heats things in a microwave. I ordered hot tea and a sandwich and it was almost $12! It's ridiculous!"}
{"text":"This place sucks! They got my coffee messed up 4 times in a row thank god I just went there couse I was doing summer school at school near by go to the closest Starbucks instead!!!!!"}
{"text":"Always fast, always friendly!
I have recently become a regular to this EB location.  I'm usually in store weekdays 7:45-8:15 am window and the wait to order and receive my meal is always minimal (2-3 min). 
 My recommendation is my usual,  power protein bagel toasted with PB and strawberry jelly."}
{"text":"if you haven't been to Einstein's your missing out me and my gf love it. first off they give you free stuff on a few occasions I've came when they have a free breakfast sandwich (no purchase necessary) or buy one get one free. Make sure to like them on fb to know when they have there giveaways and etc... And they have great discounts they even send you coupons in the mail.  Starbucks what have you done for your customers? your rewards card sux."}
{"text":"Always love Einstein's for a place to crash for a bit when I need AC and wi-fi. The drinks and bagels are yummy. This was fairly busy on a Sunday morning but service was fast and friendly and everything tasted good."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I scold myself every time \"Why do you come here? The bagels are not that tasty, the coffee's are ok at best and they are real slow ( don't come here if you are in a hurry) and they are pricey.\" Then I tell myself it was convenient since it's down the street. If you want a good bagel go to Safeway the bagels there are big, soft and chewy and the best part they are only 50 cents."}
{"text":"I do not purchase bagels all that often, but when I do, I will always purchase them from Einstein.  With that said, this particular Einstein location  has the rudest employees ever, and really have no business being behind a counter to interact with the public, and should really be working in a cubicle like environment in front of a computer. True there are other locations - unfortunately this one is the closest to my house."}
{"text":"Went to this location today.  was asked if my dog was a service animal.  I said yes and was asked to provide documentation.
Here's where you can find out that is not legal to ask an individual with a service animal to provide documentation.

\"(e) Requiring provision of identification for the service animal.\"
Here's a second source:

Doing so with a smug look on your face is adding insult to injury.  Especially coming from a teenager.
 The manager then yelled from the back that my friend and I had to leave because of our dogs.  Had I been given a chance to explain to the manager that they were service dogs, I wouldn't have written this review.  But I wasnt asked by the manager.  I was just told to leave.

{"text":"I'd say it's time for an update from a real bagel enthusiast that used to come to this location often enough! Yeah Your probably thinking what's a real bagel enthusiast going to a chain restaurant like this for, convenience and food quality when the food isn't smashed burnt or missing what you have ordered, definitely NOT the customer service, Now when I come to this location as I live close enough, I place my order (when someone is paying attention and not in the back talking or arguing about BS), when I receive my order usually it is wrong and have to have it re made or I am missing an item and or the wait is extreme and still wrong and missing something, OH it's not just once or twice here and there, it's every F******* time I stop in here to purchase something with my hard earned money! I would like to say there is a select one or two semi intelligent people who work there, BUT it seems to me the way the employees attitudes are is not pleasant it is more of a....... okay let's take your order so we can get this unwanted person out of here kind of attitude, I am a VERY nice person but I have had it, I am so sick of being nice all the time, so this is my nice review, I do not recommend this location they need a total over-haul (employee wise), they also have no (organizational skills), (listening skills), when The customers say, I would like something that I am paying for do us all a favor LISTEN and DO IT and do it RIGHT seeing as though we are the paying customer! Paying your wages after all.

making the customer happy is just the right thing to do anyway, readers please spare me the BS about me being to harsh or whatever soft BS your thinking after reading this, this place needs a good review and this is their good review HONESTY!  make sure to avoid this location at all cost.

{"text":"I am a regular customer of Einstein Bagels and this was my first visit to the Val Vista location. The place was absolutely filthy- there were bagels on the floor behind the counter, crumbs everywhere, the ceiling was yellow and had huge water spots, the utensils they were using to make the drinks were just lying on dirty countertops, the food line looked like it needed to be scrubbed...

Anyways, I order my usual Nova Lox (no red onion and capers). They were very understaffed so the line moved really slow and the lady at the cash register to pay was also swamped with all the drink orders. After 10 minutes or so, I hear my name called for my food and they made it with red onion and capers. I told them I ordered it without that and the guy re-made it. No apology, just grabbed the bag and re-made it. 

I honestly would never come back to this location- it was the worst I've ever seen"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!

 I have eaten at several of different locations and always get the same quality and consistency. They have several types of bagels and sandwich offerings, I have had the turkey which is delicious and my personal favorite the Lox sandwich that is very rare to find. The lox is of very good quality, cream cheese is delicious, and bagels are all on point no matter which one you get.

Always a great choice if you are in the mood for a quality sandwich or a nice fresh bagel. They are great at what they do here at Einstein Bros."}
{"text":"Not sure why so many people complain about the staff.. I LOVE coming here. The staff is so personable. Remembers your name, your order, and any conversations you had previously. I am in the service industry and this is so important to keep customers coming back. Yes they are loud, but they make it a fun environment. On weekends of course there will be a bit of a wait. During the week never a wait, put my order in and get my bagel right away. The staff and yummy bagels is what keeps me around."}
{"text":"Great bagel shop. Good variety of bagels and pastries, delicious iced tea and their vanilla hazelnut coffee is my favorite!

The employees do a great job of keeping the line moving and getting your food quickly. No matter how busy they are, I've never spend more than 5 minutes in line, ordering and waiting for food.

Check you mailers for coupons!"}

{"text":"Second time back after they messed up our order last week.  Guess what? They messed up our order AGAIN! 

Don't even bother going on a Saturday morning at 9:30-10:30, the line was out the door with an poorly trained kid accepting patrons at only one POS terminal (they have three), people were waiting over 10 minutes just to place their order.  Watched a woman yell at the staff because she's been waiting 15 minutes for a \"warmed up\" coffee cake.

They didn't have that end of day stale taste either.

I just love it here. The staff is very friendly and make me fee good when I come in.

I like the coupons that come in the mail those are just a bonus because I'd pay regular price just to have some of these tasty gems.

The sandwiches are very good too!

It doesn't hurt that Starbucks is next door ;)"}
{"text":"This place is barely acceptable.  Dirty, lame service, ANTS"}
{"text":"Einstein's bagels are consistently soft and delicious, and I would know because I've been here a billion times.  They almond honey cream cheese is totally bomb!  It's worth just getting a tub of it and eating it out of the tub straight up.

I would stay away from the bagel poppers since they're not very good.  Actually, I'd probably just stick with the bagels."}
{"text":"If you want to great breakfast and awesome customer service come here. Nice wonderful staff"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service everytime. Rude and very slow. They are almost always out of several flavors of bagels, really is it that hard to figure out that people are going to order plain bagels everyday."}
{"text":"YUK!
My husband brought home two breakfast bagels this morning. What a waste of money. Jack in the Box would have been better! Almost raw disgusting tasting bacon. Cheese on a \"no cheese please\". Soggy burnt edges bagels. Everything bagel tasteless and lacking almost everything! Not even sure the cheese is real. Don't waste your money. This place needs management supervision. Don't have a choice of zero stars. Check my garbage can......that is where you will find them."}
{"text":"For some reason when I look up in yelp and I walk by the Einstein's in the Hyatt, it says it's an Einstein's. Went to go redeem my birthday coupon for a free sandwich with purchase and the lady said they won't accept it because they are owned by the Hyatt. Funny thing is that's where I signed up for the emails. Shame on those 2 companies, and more so on Einstein's for allowing their name to be attached to false advertisement. Poor customer service and poor business. I shouldn't have to go out of my way to find another Einstein's that is not close to me. No thanks, but I will never be going there again."}
{"text":"So I came here for breakfast every day during my 5 day stay in Scottsdale, which just goes to show that they are awesome.

The bagles are fantastic. Exactly what I was looking for in texture and taste. I had 3 different kinds and they were all great. The spreads are good too. Also they did a nice job on the lox and it wasn't too pricy.

They do take awhile if there is a line, but there is quality in their methods, so I'd brave the line for it. 

Also, the coffee (especially the iced) is excellent!! If you check in you can even get a free one ;)"}
{"text":"Nice Bagel shop with lots of choices. Sandwiches and Bagels mostly but done extremely well. Nice staff and quick service"}
{"text":"The reason for 3 stars is that i usually get superb service and today..maybe too busy or too many new..i ordered a chai tea latte hot and got a cappuccino and a chedder jalapeño begal and got a normal jalapeño begal..very disappointed..i was pressed on time so i could not wait to have them fix...just disappointed..love their food"}
{"text":"Toasted Asiago bagel with cream cheese shame at and vanilla hazelnut latte on the way to San Jose...breakfast of champions!

Good, fast service. Airport prices though...$10 for the pair. Still...it not a surprise...it's an airport after all..."}
{"text":"I found an online coupon for BOGO bagel sandwiches....they make it so easy to just pull  up the coupon on your phone...and boom  you get the credit for it. 

I arrived at about 7am and was greeted with kindness by the young lady at the counter...I asked her questions about the sandwiches since I've never been there before...she knew the menu! It's not so uncommon now for people to have no idea about what's on the items listed....she knew it all!  My sandwiches were made quickly and exactly as requested!  

Fast and friendly service....at a super cheap price!  

Okay it's a chain and not a bakery so the bagels aren't going to make you salivate but hey it's way better than any sandwich at a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Einstein is a great place to stock up on bagels of every different size, shape, and flavor.  They have a variety of cream cheeses as well.  The coffee is a little bland and they don't have a great selection of specialty coffees.  So stick with plain coffee and you should be delighted."}
{"text":"Well, I won't be going back to this location.  If you do go, don't let Patrick take your order.  I had to repeat my order multiple times and it was still incomplete and the sandwich, that took 20 minutes to make, was incorrect.  Ordered a farmhouse with two eggs and no schmear.  Got a sandwich with a schmear and ONE egg, but was charged for two.  I'm thinking Patrick was out back, smoking weed since he reeked of it when at the register and that's why the service was so poor.  The quality of service is reflected in the management; the floor had crumbs and a couple tables were sticky.  I have had to wait at other locations, but the lines were long and the food was correct.  I guess when you're that close to the Las Vegas strip, you have to take what you can get, which is abhorant."}
{"text":"Woke up with a hankering for coffee and a bagel. Decided I'd try out this place because it had some good reviews. I was a little worried once I walked in and found a crowd, but the people working there are Pros and I was out of there in five minutes. The bagels were very good and I'm in love with their Christmas blend coffee. Much better than Starbucks"}
{"text":"It saddens me to see a chain harmed by poor customer service and an unclean environment. This store was a mess, poorly stocked, unprofessional, and just an all around negative experience. 

Three employees behind the counter and with total disregard for their business. 

Taking down orders without checking to see if they even have the product is a sign of poor management (training and ordering) and planning. Went in on a Thursday around 11, and they didn't have OJ on display. As I was walking out, I overheard another group of guests complaining about how their ordered was incorrect.

I love Einstein Bagels, but this place is a sad excuse for one."}
{"text":"This location is closed. It was replaced with a Starbucks.

There is nothing more that can be added to this review...

Attention Yelp staff... REMOVE THIS LOCATION FROM YOUR DATABASE!!!!"}
{"text":"I would love to be able to give them a better rating ,however after several visits in the last month the inconsistency and the poor service and the workers who are not knowledgeable in proper customer service , I have to say that the only reason I return is my family's love of the actual bagels -- that is if they haven't run out before 10 am on any given day ! 

If you want or expect the best deal make sure to ask questions because they will not offer the best deal to you ."}
{"text":"I generally enjoy eating at Einstein's. It's a good tasting, quick, and fairly priced meal. The shmears are good, the bagels are fresh, and the sandwiches are filling. So, I must let you know this review applies only to this Einstein's.

I've come here quite a few times, but finally decided to write a review because I'm sick of the mistakes - it needs to be said. At any fast(ish) food restaurant, there is always an expectation of some mistakes being made on your food. But when those mistakes are continually made and cost you extra money...you start getting fed up.

I've had certain staff members screw up my order every time they make it. This is very frustrating, especially when you order cream-cheese (at something like $1.50 extra..which is kinda ridiculous in the first place) and you don't get it with your food, it's infuriating. When you often get your food to go, you don't realize until you reach your destination and it is too late by then. You always have to check your order after leaving Taco Bell, but I thought Einsteins was a little higher than that - apparently not this one.

However, there is one shining star - Cathrin. If everybody made your order as quickly or perfectly as her, this place would be getting a much higher rating from me.

So, if you are going to this location, I warn you. Some of the employees don't pay attention."}
{"text":"Thank you to Steve at this Baum Blvd location.  The other day I was at the Einstein's in downtown Pittsburgh.  I had an $15 order and my gift card would not work despite the fact that I had over $23 on it.  So I paid cash 

My card did not scan at the Baum Blvd location either.  so Steve typed in the numbers on the back of the card and it worked!!!!!  

Thank you Steve!!!!

Also before giving my card to Steve he
 greeted me in a very friendly manner.  I noticed that he has Ben greeting everybody that way.

I love the variety of bagels that Einstein's offer.  The Cranberry are the best followed by the Chocolate Chip"}
{"text":"There are very few bagel shops in the Old Town area other than this Einsteins and a couple of others.  So, every now and then, I'll pop into this location to pick up some bagels for the house... they happen to have tasty schmears (aka cream cheese flavors) and quality lox as well.

Unfortunately, the last few times I've been to this location, the service has been painfully slow.  Also, they are often out of certain kinds of bagels that I like including the honey whole wheat.  

On the bright side, they will slice the bagels for you and/or put them in plastic bags to keep them fresh.  Their coffee isn't bad, and this location has a decent sized parking lot too... and if you need any groceries, you can run next door to Trader Joe's (or around the corner to AJ's) without moving your car!

If you have the time and don't mind driving a tad bit further, I recommend both Chompie's and NY Bagel and Bialy over Einsteins, but if your expectations are in check and/or you're in a hurry, this Einsteins will do.  Just keep in mind that it's a chain, the service may be slow, and while the food won't blow you away, it is pretty consistent."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! We stood in a long line this morning, ordered 4 bagels and paid. Then an employee placed a bag with 3 bagels on the counter by the cash register. We said we ordered 4 and asked if we had been charged for 3 or 4 bagels. The cashier, Kathy, said her computer screen had moved on to the next customer so she didn't know how many we'd paid for; she seemed completely unfamiliar with their pricing structure or basic elementary school math (we paid $4.06, so at $1.25/bagel plus tax, clearly that was 3 bagels). She told us to go stand at the end of the line again if we wanted a 4th bagel.

We asked for the receipt which she did have but had not offered to us. We had paid for 3 bagels. Then she said she didn't take the order and wasn't responsible for correcting it. I found that to be a terrible attitude as I was expecting her to go get another bagel or at least to offer an apology for the mistake.

I asked to speak to the manager. The manager came over, I explained that our order was incorrect and that my expectation was the order would be corrected without me standing in the long line all over again. She stared at me without saying one word. Not one word. No apology; no offer to correct the order; nothing. That is not acceptable."}
{"text":"I had a very standard experience at this Einstein Bros. Not sure how to elaborate about a fast food experience. It was absolutely fine. The service was friendly and quick, I got my bagel, and I ate it outside.

That's it! This Einstein Bros. has a decent Bagle and Lox plate (but they were out of capers...) with a great patio."}
{"text":"I used to live by this Einstein's and would visit it regularly. I'm not sure what happened in the last six months, but the place is mess and an absolute joke. I ordered a very simple sandwich and told them that I would be eating it to-go. Typically I wait 5-7 minutes tops, even when it's busy. The staff preparing the food and drinks looked completely overwhelmed and the girl on the register looked completely lost, like a deer in headlights. I sat and waited patiently because I know how busy they can get in the morning. So I sat and waited. And waited. And waited...for 22 minutes. I watched many people who ordered after me get their food, eat it, and leave before I got up to get my money back. When I got to the counter and demanded my refund, I was met with attitude and the excuse that they were \"really busy\". Obviously. I didn't even receive a \"sorry\" for my wait or for the inconvenience. This is NOT how you run a business! A customer should not have to wait almost a half an hour for a bagel! Fix this issue! Your prices are already crazy for a turkey sandwich, don't make the customer regret it by having horrible service and under an unapologetic staff. This location will never get our business again."}
{"text":"I stop here almost every morning. Mainly cause I don't like making my own breakfast.   Now they can get busy at times but they always plug along and push to provide awesome customer service. Kudos to the two managers they have and their hard working staff!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and was extremely disappointed. Both of the bagels that were ordered were burnt to a crisp (see posted photo). We got the bagels to go, so we didn't notice until we got home.. Really disappointed"}
{"text":"food is great, always have good service, except for this one girl who was working today. Jodeci, she was sitting at a table with a group of her friends while still in uniform & she's cursing up a storm. the workers up front called her up to the register twice while i was there and she got mad both times."}
{"text":"How is the bagel place out of plain every single time??? And runs out AFTER you order the item in the Window that is there when you ordered it. This place is out of bagels at 900am. You opened three hours ago. C'mon ownership. You can do better."}
{"text":"Good food, but they take a long time and almost always get the order wrong.  The selection of bagels around 11am is also pretty slim.  I love bagels, but this place is nowhere near the best."}
{"text":"Einstein's never disappoints. My hubs really doesn't like their everything bagel but thats what i go for with their yummy hummus instead of a cream cheese. They do have a nice cinnamon sugar bagel that the child will eat with strawberry cream cheese. If you ask the hub, he would say tasty turkey sammy on an asiago bagel all day. 

Pretty decent brewed iced tea which is a bonus for me. A place goes down in my books for having gold peak \"tea\". Sick. Consistent chain bagel joint."}
{"text":"Shmearfuls were hard as rock. Completely inedible. DON'T BUY THEM! They sold out of five cheese bagels but still charged us for them and then gave us 1 rock hard shmearful to make up the difference. It was a take out order so we didn't notice until we got home. Waste of money, waste of time."}
{"text":"This place is awesome the food is great but the service sucks I waited for my bagel nova lox for 15 minutes and the guy making them has a very bad attitude the place isn't that busy I'm surprised how rude this man is"}
{"text":"Disgusting! I am the one who posted the picture of the blue egg and contacted corporate about the terrible experience. I was contacted by WILLIS WALKER in response to my corporate feedback. I had multiple back and forth emails with Willis which included sending him pictures of the offending sandwich and a copy of my receipt. The last email from him was on 8/18/14 in which he asked for my address (with the assumption a refund for my purchase was coming) and I have yet to receive any other feedback, anything in the mail, and clearly since it is now October 22nd the ball has been dropped. 

There is clearly no care of oversight at this location. There are really not many places to eat in this airport but you are much better off getting a bag of Doriitos for the store than dealing with this location. 

Terrible."}
{"text":"Sorry, but this particular store is going down hill. We have come here for years but as of late they are never open on time. And when they do open there is only one person to do everything. Then, 10 minutes later here come one person to help. Then 20 minutes after opening, here comes another employee.  And he was sent home. ????On a couple of occasions they opened late and didn't have the coffee ready or any dairy products out. Our biggest disappointment is that there are only about 4 different kinds of bagels ready. None in baskets in display case just on a cart. We always get pumpernickel and there is NEVER any of those ready at opening. We are always told they will be out in 7 minutes but of course 15 minutes later they call our name.  One would presume that OPEN means READY to take care of customers. This place certainly is not that!"}
{"text":"Once in a blue moon I crave a bagel with cream cheese and I stop here for that craving. It's usually busy in the morning but that's expected. Their bagels are always fresh and the workers are always friendly. I recommend this place for personal service or treating your workers to a nice treat."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a bite one morning and the line was out the door! The Green Chlie and Cheese Bagels are what we came for and thank goodness when it was our turn to order, we snagged the last two....SCORE!

We also shared a bagel with Peanut butter, Banana and Honey which was also pretty good. Service was quick and friendly ... no complaints there. Next time, we'll avoid the busy times and probably go in between the Breakfast and Lunch rush to avoid the crowds...ALOHA!

{"text":"I was having coffee and a bagel with a business associate in Einstein's this afternoon. While we were there, one of the employees came out to sweep the store. Half the dining room is carpet and the other half is hard floor. He started aggressively sweeping the carpet mats, kicking up a dust cloud. Seeing us sitting there less than ten feet away, he starts sweeping right at our table with open coffee cups and food. I then looked over and saw the dust heading toward the open racks of bagels behind the front counter as he continued to sweep. So gross on all accounts. I'd never go here again. Makes me question any Einstein's. If this is what they do with us sitting there, imagine what we don't see...!"}
{"text":"It's very simple:  a well done cinnamon raisin bagel with cream cheese. A hot cup of coffee. You can't get that wrong...,and they didn't! 

Yummy!! Definitely worth another trip!"}
{"text":"Einstein's is one of my all time favorite places.  I adore bagels, and there is nothing better in the world than a BLT on an everything bagel.  And they can do it right.  I'm sure there are quainter, less corporate mom and pop bagel places out there, but for my money, I like knowing what I'm getting, and knowing that it's gonna be good every time  I go in."}
{"text":"People, avoid this location at all costs!  

Each time I get a to go order, I'm missing items I paid for or get the wrong stuff.   The place is dirty, the staff unorganized and overwhelmed.  

Today, I showed them a Monday Baker's Dozen special I received via email and was told \"our location doesn't offer this deal\" 

I'll rather drive the extra mile to the Scottsdale Rd./Pinnacle Peak location.

regarding the 5 star previous post:  
Sorry...  I'm not cleaning nasty tables so that I can eat there and smell burnt bagels while I watch frustrated customers trying to get their orders in.  But I guess, everyone has different standards."}
{"text":"What happened? It's disappointing when you find a great place to have breakfast, like Einstein Bagels at 1405 Sunset in Henderson and then they change managers and destroy the good feeling. The old manager had personality, was always happy and interfaced with every customer. Not the experience today! New manager who hasn't smiled since 1982 and 1 order wrong, the second order the eggs tasted more like onions than egg. Very disappointed. Maybe last time these two \"regular\" customers return."}
{"text":"We were out early around 8:45 am, due to the triple digit temperatures, and selected Einstein Bros because my husband is a bagel lover. There were several seated customers and the selection to choose from was terrific. Pleasant people behind the counter to make and schmear our bagel selections and our coffee orders. Fresh, delicious, and great coffee! Very casual and no waiting for our order! We will indeed make this Einstein Bros Bagel our \"Hey, I feel like a bagel, don't you?\" place!"}
{"text":"Great staff, clean environment! They had a lot of people come in for catering orders. Coffee was fresh and food tasted awesome."}
{"text":"Came into this location just after 12pm, it was slow. Only one couple waiting on an order. After about 4-5 minutes the gentleman who was making the drink order for the couple said he could take my order at at the pay here cashier, still no hello or further greeting. I gave him my order and went to get my hot coffee while I waited. Two of the four coffees were empty, the third came out cold, so I had to settle for the decaf coffee which was moderately warm. The employee making my sandwich yelled across the room if I wanted it here or Togo as if I was a bother. Even though my order on the receipt said Togo. I received my order and when I got outside to eat it, it was a mess and barely warm. I had to reorganize the entire sandwich in order to eat it without it falling apart. The employees appeared bothered and were not pleasant to speak with. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Has a variety of bagels, which was super nice.  The staff was really friendly and helpful.  I ordered a potato bagel (toasted) and got the boyfriend a pastry (toasted) as well.  I was super happy.  

I would go back for sure, its nice to get something simple and not from a past food joint."}
{"text":"Well the person taking my order was nice but waited 20 mins to get my one bagel and cream cheese not toasted.    Wow really can they work any slower   And it was only 9:00 am    Then all of the sudden employee started coming from The back to help the people waiting"}
{"text":"Love the bagels and the spreads but it always seems to take longer than it should.  They should also set up so small orders can get through quicker,  large orders bogs it down.."}
{"text":"I was pleased with how quick and nice the service was here.
ALTHOUGH YES - it is quick and that comes at a cost - your bagel will only be luke warm, stuff won't be melty. I get it, though. It's an airport location. I think they are trying to move people through.

THEREFORE If you want extra heat/melty, let them know. But I would def go again. I was starving and it hit the spot. Not bad at all for airport food/option."}
{"text":"Surprisingly enough this would be my first time reviewing this place even though I come here at least once a week. I would say on Saturdays it has been a recent tradition to pick up the Applewood Bacon and Cheddar on an Ancient Grain bagel. Of course it's a must to add on the double egg to that extra delicious egg flavor and not a substitute base egg like most other places! To go with my egg sandwich, I have to  compliment this with a cold brew and a splash of almond milk to maintain the coffee bean flavors. One would not automatically think that Einstein is more then just bagel spot. If you like strong flavored beans, then this place is right for you!"}
{"text":"This is the most disorganized, slow, inefficient Einsteins I've ever been to. I've been a handful of times since they opened / reopened and each time has been a worse experience than the last. The line was out the door this morning for no real reason that I could identify. It took me 25 minutes to get a bagel to go. I realized after the fact that the type bagel I had ordered was not ready / baking. They should tell the customer that and give them another option in the event they don't have time to wait. The staff seems busy and frantic so it's not as though people are standing around doing nothing-- clearly a case of bad management. Unfortunately I won't be returning as I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt as a new store. Avoid this Einsteins unless you have ample time to wait"}
{"text":"For the second time in about a week I slept in and needed to find something to eat on the way.  Last time I got a donut and a bagel someplace else and was disappointed in the bagel.  I had not been in this Einsteins in over 10 years.  Not much has changed, a few more menu items.  I got an onion bagel with salmon schmear.  Much better!  These may not be the best bagels in the valley but are as good as it gets for this neighborhood."}
{"text":"Agree with most reviews here. I don't expect much from chain shops, but what I do expect is they get our order right and treat me with respect. 

This spot earned its two stars for incorrectly placing our to-go order.  It's always sad to return home and find something missing! Otherwise, the employees did their best to take our order and be polite. 

The food we did receive tasted great and of course we'll come back to Einsteins again, just not this location!"}
{"text":"Can we say the honey salmon on Apple is nothing short amazing !!!!! Loved loved loved it . Must try . The line was long but don't be fooled it moves pretty quickly . Good customer service and awesome staff"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a  Bagel-Dog. They had only one on the shelf. Looked as if it had been pre-cooked once or twice. After asking if there were any others, I was told, \"Nope. That's it.\"
So I left it and walked out. So much for my Bagel-Dog.
It will be a long time before I go into that place again."}
{"text":"This place is the worst! The customer service sucks, it's run by a bunch of kids that don't give a shi* about helping you. They always seem annoyed to make your food. God forbid you call in a take out order. You ask for light spread and they purposefully smother it. Take a look at the picture I just posted.

Last time I picked up a sandwich there I found curly black hairs in my sandwich. They gave me a coupon for a free sandwich. They should shut this place down for health code violations.

Talk to the management and they're fully aware of how much the operation sucks. I just really wish they would make a change. I'm never going back."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast spot! Fast service, great ambiance and easy access!  It is located in the lobby of the Hyatt and is a great, easy breakfast place in Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food and quick service. There is nothing magical about the store itself (located in Safeway strip mall), but you can be confident that the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I feel like a discovered a real gem with Einstein Bros Bagels in Bloomfield. The staff are some of the coolest nicest people I've ever encountered at establishments of this type. They made me feel really welcome. The coffee is self-service and there's fast free wifi. It's a great place to hang out while you're waiting for your film to be processed at the nearby CVS. 

What I like most about it is the kind of 'motorway service stop' vibe at Einstein Bros, particularly in the decor and music choices. I feel like I'm an adventurer, Kerouacan beatnik or lone-ranging truck driver while I chow down here. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had a good experience at this location, even though I wish the Einsteins out here in AZ would stay open later! The people who work here were nice enough. I can't say anything bad about this particular location."}
{"text":"Einstein has an interesting way of taking your order - instead of standing in line, making your order, paying for it, then waiting for your food to enjoy. They add another step: between making your order and paying for it, they make you wait again. Personally, I'm a 4 step kinda girl, so that extra 5th step throws me off a little. 

Every bagel I have ever tried here has been delicious! I wouldn't recommend the Bagel Poppers, after about 3 of them you start to feel like a damp sponge that has be left outside on a very humid day...not good. Don't get their hot chocolate unless you like the super sweet milky tasting coco - I prefer a stronger/bitter chocolate.

This location is always packed, but I have never had bad service - and I am a fan!"}
{"text":"Love that they have the dozen to go bagels ready and boxed.  Ran in and ran out and back to the office to feed the team!"}
{"text":"I stopped by to grab lunch before I went to visit my hubby in the hospital.  The parking is crazy!  That plaza is jam packed.  Got to the store, the tables are dirty, people are everywhere, and the employee was ready to take my order.  I just stepped in the place and I have not been there in a LONG time.  I ordered the turkey swiss bagel for lunch quickly. The sandwich was ok.  I think I will stick with bagel with cream cheese."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place is going downhill!  I've been going here since it opened. Prior to the fire next door it was a hit and miss ordering and receiving what your ordered. Now it's just downhill!  Please change the management because the product is good it's the service"}
{"text":"Good food but POOR customer service. 5 people working and not a single one engaged in customer service. I had to ask if the order that was slapped on the counter was mine and then half of them ignored me and the one guy that answer looked annoyed."}
{"text":"Really nice staff.  I always enjoy the bagels I get for take out.  Delish.  Today I was craving a tuna sandwich on their whole grain bread.  When visiting Albuquerque, my coworker and I got the tuna sandwich twice for lunch and we loved it.  Today I drove the two miles back to my office to eat my sandwich and not only was the bread totally stale and dry, but I bit into a piece of tomato and lettuce and ZERO tuna.  When I opened the sandwich, the small blob of tuna salad was smaller that the tomato slice (small) on the sandwich.  SOOOO disappointed because of what I was expecting.  I was also given the option of \"fruit, potato salad or chips\" and I said \"Fruit please!\"  Then I was told \"well the fruit is those bananas over there and they aren't ripe.\"  Yep, there were green as grapes.  Really Einsteins manager, you can't walk across the street to Frys or Trader Joes and get some ripe bananas or maybe even a few cantalopes to cut up?  Ridic.  Please do better next time Einsteins.  I paid over $18 bucks for the sandwich, three bagels to go and two doggie bagels."}
{"text":"I've been to a number of Einstein's Bagels, but this one really stands out above the rest. 

Excellent customer service! A staff member named Chelsea welcomed every single customer in the store and seemed genuinely happy to see them. When she wasn't busy behind the counter taking breakfast orders, she was switching out the freshly brewed coffee, wiping down tables, and asking guests how their meal was. 

I ordered a breakfast sandwich and medium coffee - both were delicious and quickly prepared. The coffee bar was clean, well stocked, and the coffee carafes were full which I appreciated. The egg whites, mushrooms, asparagus, and Swiss cheese where delicious on a toasted garlic bagel. 

This location has a great neighborhood feel - a few customers greeted one another while enjoying their breakfast and Chelsea even knew several regular customers by name! Such a welcoming and friendly vibe here. I usually frequent the Tempe location which is heavily populated with students with laptops and iPods who mostly avoid eye contact, so it was refreshing when an older gentleman said good morning to me when he sat down at the next table.  

Come here to enjoy a tasty breakfast in a relaxing and welcoming environment."}
{"text":"Service was horrible wasn't even busy and for them to mess up my order and remake my sandwich that looked disgusting cold, and just thrown in my bag. 

Crystal was the manager, she was very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Normally this is a great place to come, but I gotta say I was really let down today.  I'd like to think an order of 8 bagels isn't the end of the world.  Busy or not.  

Not happy that 6/8 bagels were made incorrectly in some capacity or another.  I think I will keep future orders to one bagel at a time, they seem to be able to handle that most days."}
{"text":"Out of the apple cinnamon bagels, when asked if they would bake more, they said \"not today\"."}
{"text":"As I can see, the Einstein Bros Bagels around the valley get lousy reviews. I'm not anticipating change but time and time again, they get my simple order wrong and it gets old after a while. Every time I go in there, their customer service is lousy. I get some brain dead stoner who has no idea what is going on or some cranky girl whose day has been ruined by hundreds of people who have the nerve to crave carbs on her watch. 
Here's my order because this is how my son likes it: \"Can I get an Everything Bagel, plain, NO cream cheese, toasted?\". What do I get EVERY. SINGLE. TIME? An everything bagel with plain cream cheese on it. It gets old! No means no, people!
Not only do they get your order wrong but stoner guy eats the bacon while he is cooking it (I've seen him sneak a bite) and if you walk in there while they're not busy, you can often find car keys, money, a purse, and cigarettes on the counter where you order your food. 
Come here future customers! If you're looking for a crabby bagel maker to get your order wrong or a stoner who could careLESS, you've come to the right place!"}
{"text":"This place is really overrated. The bagels are mediocre and they give you the smallest amount of cream cheese, the only way to get a suitable amount is to pay extra to get double cream cheese. Overpriced for the quality and amount of food you get as well."}
{"text":"I ordered a jalapeño bagel with strawberry shmear, a fruit cup, and a strawberry lemonade. The bagels here are always great to savor cravings and there is no way anyone could botch a fruit cup. There was a sign that said they have strawberry lemonade now. So sure, why not try their lemomade?

To my surprise, they don't make their lemonade by order, they just let it sit out in their front counter. As skeptical as I was, i still bought it. Turns out that the \"lemonade\" didn't have a hint of lemon in it! It was literally pink water.

From the dull service to the completely watered down lemonade, the only things saving business are the customers that overflow from the Starbucks next door."}
{"text":"i come here almost every other morning to pick up a bite to eat before i head towards my long boring day at work. Since i have time on my hands i do not mind the slow service. yes this Einsteins bagels is a GREAT deal slower than the one off of mcClintock and Guadalupe and actually now that i think of it once they screwed up my order and didnt realize til i was 15 minutes down the street :|

majority of the time they are just average. if they screw up my order one more time though im sticking to the mcclintock and quadalupe location. Fast and Efficient. 

Like jennifer said though...its not severe enough to keep me from returning. i just want my bagel and honey butter for the day!"}
{"text":"Everything was available even a clear line to the front! The honey butter was sensational and enjoyed immensely. I have kind of fallen out of Einstein's grips because I support local establishments over chains any day."}
{"text":"This place is located in the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Downtown Phoenix.  If you are working in the area or staying at this hotel it can be very convenient.  

I have heard that they do not accept promotional items here or gift cards at this location which can be a huge bummer, thus minus 1 star.  They will usually open on time at 6 am, but there are times, where I'm staring at the door for them to open.  I love the different types of bagel sandwiches they have available, and even lighter options too.  For example, the Swiss, mushroom and asparagus is delicious!  I do enjoy their lemonades, but they are kind of pricey.  Actually, everything is kind of pricey to me, but I keep coming back!

Overall, I will be back for more!  The staff is usually pretty quick and I love their bagels!  

(Belated) YELP REVIEW CHALLENGE #29/31"}
{"text":"What a terrible experience at this one! I have never seen a worse ran store of any type. If you are a regular you get to skip non regular's in line because they walk in the door get their order's made skip you in line and you don't even get asked what you want until that regular has their food and has paid! We were in line before three of these regulars walked in and they had everything and paid before we were spoken to. I called the area manager Rosita and didn't even get a call back, too bad that this area of Einstein's has failed miserably! I was a huge fan of Einstein's in other cities but will never visit another one again. I know these are very strong words, but they are very well deserved!"}
{"text":"Came by here after grabbing some Dutch Bros to get some bagels. We arrived a little late in the morning (around 10am), so there wasn't the greatest selection of bagels left. I understood though and ordered a Jalapeno and cheddar bagel and a chocolate chip cookie to take for later. The bagel was really good. I found out this company is the same as Noah's bagel back here in CA, so the menu was very similar. The bagel was nice and crispy and had a nice bite to it because of the jalapenos. The cookie unfortunately melted in my pocket, but I ate it anyways! It was nice and not too overwhelming with the chocolate. Overall, solid spot for a bagel!"}
{"text":"Service is never good- went here for lunch and had to upsell myself since chips and drink weren't offered! Food came to over $11 for a bagel sandwhich small drink and small bag of chips- sandwhich was good but certainly not worth the money I paid.  Nearby lunch venues were very busy and so I went to Einsteins because no wait but I guess that should of been a sign.  Customer service here is the worst- employees act like your bothering them by coming in and wanting to order- something as simple as asking for a pickle comes with an eye roll- the number 1 problem here is the service #2 is the cost- it's lunch meat turkey no reason your lunch should cost more than going to a sit down restaurant-"}
{"text":"5 star if u get there early. Wide variety of breakfast choices quick and friendly. 

If you get there after 9am you will have a 30 min wait when there is an event across the street.

Lunch always seems to be fine"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times in the past few months, each time regretting it. The last time I went the service was slow and they messed up my order. The person making the bagels made a big deal about it, as if it was my fault. They said I would have do with out the veggie that came on the bagel because they used the last veggies they had on the bagel they messed up. Today when I went, I spent 30 minutes there and left with nothing. I asked if I could order the herbivore sub cream cheese for hummus (I've ordered this before). The cashier asked the lady making the sandwiches and she rudely replied \"What do you think?\". The cashier told me I couldn't do that. I asked how much it'd cost to buy a bagel with hummus add veggies. It would've cost be almost 2$ extra to add a tomato and cucumbers! I opted for a bagel with hummus and after waiting 15 minutes was told they didnt have hummus. I asked for a refund. They refused to give me a refund asking if i wanted cream cheese. I told them I was allergic to dairy and they offered me cream cheese again. I asked for  refund and the lady making the sandwiches said her manager wasn't there and she didnt have time to give me her information. I had to get back in line and ask the cashier for the manager's phone number. RIDICULOUS! I will make sure not to recommend this location to any of my students or colleagues."}
{"text":"Came here for coffee and breakfast. I stood at the \"order here\" for 10 minutes.  No ones there so I walk over to the \"pay here\" line since I saw another customer go there. Some big heavy set white girl who was very rude walks out. My partner approaches her since the customer in front of me was asking if she was in the right spot. My partner says \"where do we...\" the big lady interrupts her and says \"illlllll take you over here, **mummbles** you guys keep moving back n forth back n forth\" my partner said well if you were out here we would know where to put in an order. 

We left right after before my partner lost it. 

I love Einstein Bagels, their coffee etc. But the customer service here is not good. Management needs to take a second look at the people they hire. 

Will never come back to this location."}
{"text":"So just like everyone else, I love Einstein bagels! They're always super fresh and their strawberry banana smoothies are really good! The real star of this review is not the bagels, but rather Kim, one of the employees. I came this afternoon for a bagel and was greeted with a bright smiling face and welcoming demeanor. I watched Kim interact with other customers and her kindness and care was admirable. When it came time for her to take my order, she was sweet, polite, and very professional. After she asked for my name for the order, she referred back to my name when calling my order and was just overall really really nice. She made my experience great! The customer service she provided is usually one found at a 5 star resort and Einstein's is lucky to have her!"}
{"text":"so craving bagels a friend and I ventured here for lunch (University and Rural location)
. I had been to both stores in different states so i was excited to get my bagel fix.  Breakfast sandwiches YES! but the eggs look over easy and I hate that. So I ask the girl taking my order...are the eggs scrambled?  YES! she says....and then my sandwich comes and NO...they are not.  I tell the girl...I ASKED you, and you said yes and she is like...well that is the way they all come(unscrambled) and she was so rude! Like I was a total B...for even being upset that she lied to me! 
Don't go here. Don't ever go here!! Goto NY Bagels 2 blocks up. At least they don't lie to you and then be completely rude. Or and just so there is no mistake, per my receipt, my \"Host\" name was Samantha."}
{"text":"Wow! No waiting for the first time ever at this location. I guess the trick is to come here before 7 AM. Normally, the wait is approximately 5 to 10 minutes and the line usually extends past the door. You always have fresh products, which are obviously baked that same morning. The bagels have a harder outer shell and a soft, chewy inner.  They do run out of the popular bagels by the mid afternoon. Service is usually quick, efficient and with a smile. I do enjoy their coffee, with most having a hint of spice, unlike our busier chain coffee store down the road which is bitter.  Their cream cheese is light and fluffy, not the most flavorful, but does the trick. The music being played is a tad loud for 620am however."}
{"text":"Its extremely busy in the morning and the staff are not able to serve customers quickly. I have received burnt bagels, unsweetened lattes and many wrong orders"}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 2013- 16/100

Einstein Bros Bagels as a company is great! I never have a bad bagel or experience. 

Bagel:
I chose to try the $3.99 special- which includes a medium coffee and bagel w/ cream cheese.  During my last visit, I opted for a pretzel bagel with a shmear of veggie cream cheese, and it was HEAVENLY!  If there is one thing I love about running- it's the guilt free bagels I get to  gobble down. Mmm Mmm- Sorry Paleo fans .. more bagels for me!

Coffee:
As for their Coffee drinks ...they give Starbucks a run for their money- at least when it comes to price. For their non straight coffee drinks you get a punch card and every 5 or so drinks is free. That's really great deal. My favorite is their Vanilla Hazelnut coffee.

Service: 
Service here was fast and the staff was friendly and feverishly working on cranking out order after order since the place was hopping. Can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"It is a shame this place can not get it together, The last time i was here it took 20 minutes to get a single toasted bagel. 20 minutes!  If their food was not so darn tasty and it was not right up the road, i would never go to this Einstein's again. But for now, i will just visit occasionally on the weekends when i have the time to wait 20 minutes for a bagel."}
{"text":"This location has nice staff. I like the specialty bagels; spinach and chilies. I prefer the breakfast options at Brooklyn Bros better. This place relies more on the \"synthetic\",  if you will, eggs, bacon, and sausage and the fresh squeezed orange juice is really minute maid light pulp. But the Nova Lox is good as well as the flavored coffees."}
{"text":"Good variety of bagel selections. Cashier made me feel rushed when ordering and couldn't answer my questions about what flavor iced coffees they carried, which was a little disappointing considering it was my first time going. Aside from that though bagel and coffee were good and I enjoyed the outdoor patio seating with my friend. Would go again."}
{"text":"Walked in to make a order and waited at the counter for 5-8 min for help Some white guy popped his head from behind and saw me waiting and still didn't come to the counter to take my order. I walk out to go back to my car but I really wanted a bagel so I made an attempt to try again. I walk back into Einstein bagels and see this Mexican lady at the counter I tell her my order and she's so rude. She points at the case and says these are all the bagels I have left with a facial expression of rudeness. Seriously lady if you don't like you're job quit. I know some people have their bad days but if I'm a paying customer and I'm contributing to your paycheck with my business, please try and act professional. Worst experience ever and I'm not ever coming back to this place ever again. If you want rude customer service this is the place to go. Zero stars"}
{"text":"Best place for a bagel breakfast, and perfectly brewed coffee every time. I have been to several Einstein bagels in Az and Cali, and the Ahwatukee store is the best!"}
{"text":"Oh goodness does this place ROCK with their coffees and drinks. Oh my, oh my!  They have a good selection of cakes, pastries, salads, paninis, sandwiches, etc if you're looking to grab a bite here. Einstein is also known as 'Noah's Bagels' in the West Coast and having had tried 'Noah's', I knew Einstein would be greaaat! 

I was feeling adventurous and ordered their mudslide smoothie. I got to choose a cookie from their cookie basket to add into the smoothie. It was creamy, rich and totally worth $5! I skipped the whipped cream, as it was already pretty rich for what it was. 

Our cashier guy was very friendly, too and an excellent barista who made an excellent drink! Kudos to Einstein's!"}
{"text":"I was the first one in line and all I wanted was a large coffee cup and a medium coffee cup. Literally all that was required of the staff was to take my $5 bill and hand me these two cups.

I decided to take my business next-door to Starbucks"}
{"text":"The service here is terrible.  I went here and attempted to buy a bakers dozen of everything bagels, and the guy behind the counter refused to sell me more than eight of them.  I just walked out in response.  The workers there would rather be lazy & provide lousy service instead of make more bagels.  I recommend avoiding this place."}
{"text":"Just found out the general manager is A cocaine user, and lives with cocaine and marijuana dealer. she needs to be drug tested immediately"}
{"text":"Love their bagels and their flavored coffee. So good however this location seems to be out of bagels every Friday morning. They cannot plan for the Friday morning office rush at all."}
{"text":"Quick bagel stop, can't go wrong here! I love the shmear options and the bagels are fresh! I ordered a cold brew and it was a perfect start to the day! Parking is pretty simple especially early in the morning. Customer service is good here!"}
{"text":"Always a solid choice for lunch when your tired of regular sandwiches and subs.  Can't go wrong with the Tasty Turkey on the Asiago bagel.  Service is fast and friendly.  This particular location is clean as well.  I recommend the Jalapeño chips.  Some of my favorites around! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Coffee and bagels! Very good!
If you love coffee and bagels and I do you will not be disappointed here! Everything is so fresh, and good quality, if you can think of a bagel and something to put on it (or just order off the menu) you will not be disappointed, I promise. Might have gotten 5 stars, but I would have liked to see the shop just a bit cleaner, not gonna stop me from going back."}
{"text":"Yum! Prices are good and the options are nice! Line moved fast and the staff were professional and kind."}
{"text":"Ordered the bagel box. The bagels were fresh and delicious as expected. The service was fast and friendly. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Once again they were out of multiple items.  It was difficult to find a dozen that worked for me.  If you sell food, but have none available just close."}
{"text":"I love there bagels they are so good. Also if you need not know the plan  bagel is vegan!!!"}
{"text":"I am not surprised to see this get a 2.5 average in stars... This is second time I have been by early (8am) to get cinnamon sugar bagels and they were out.  I went through drive through, so when I go to pay they said \"We are out of the ones you want is French Toast ok?\"... That's it? No apology or concern at all.  It's a shame as the bagels are really good.  There are too many breakfast options to go back here.  I will not return.  The one by my house in Chandler is much better."}
{"text":"They no longer serve Turkey Bacon!!! WTF ....what about the people that dont eat Pork!?...too much socializing among the staff, not professional at all, save it for your lunch break"}
{"text":"I always love the food but the employees at this location were blantanly not doing their job. They took forever to start my food because they were too busy talking to one another as their was no one else in the store and then after dropping half of my egg sandwich on the counter served it to me. Workers are clearly not supervised and don't care for their job :("}
{"text":"Just to be clear, I am only reviewing the bagels and not the other food or drinks sold at Einstein Bros Bagels. And, full disclosure, I am originally from New York and know what a bagel should be (one of my first after school jobs was working in a bagel bakery on Long Island). This review is based upon the baker's dozen bagels I bought at this Einstein's less than a week ago. To put it bluntly, the bagels are a huge disappointment. For an establishment that has the word \"bagels\" in their name, it is shockingly bad. To put this in perspective, it is not as bad as a frozen bagel that you would buy in the grocery store. But it was no better than the fresh bagels you could buy at a grocery store like Schnucks. And not nearly as good as the bagels they sell at Panera. Einstein bagels are of the quality that they have to be toasted before you eat them - even when you first buy them. That is a sad thing to say about a fresh baked bagel, but it is a fact."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past year or so probably 1-2 times during the work week to get a quick bagel and coffee on my way to the office. The location is super convenient for me, but lately I've found that their process could be MUCH more efficient. You order at one place, pay at another, then everyone waits in a really awkward herd by the counter for their order. I feel like I'm ALWAYS in the way of the coffee/drink station. It's just poor planning. 
The 3 stars are for their sundried tomato cream cheese (yum) and good coffee. Also the service is always friendly."}
{"text":"We visit this Einstein's at least once of month since it is close to our home. We often get a couple breakfast sandwiches to go. We love the menu but have to say that nearly every time we order to go, we find something wrong with the sandwich when we get home (wrong bagel/topping we requested off instead on). This can be frustrating and disappointing. We never return with the mismade sandwich because it's entirely inconvenient. Please get our order right!"}
{"text":"Tony B review on 11/27/10 states he had a hair on his fruit.  The EXACT same thing happened to me.  

You don't get very much food for the price, but what you get tastes good.  If it was a little cheaper and I had not gotten hairy fruit I might have gone 3 stars on this.  I will go back but this is not one of those places that I would rave about."}
{"text":"There's clearly a reason this place has two stars. Customer service seriously sucks, aside from unfriendly and lack of personality and bad attitudes,  they served us rotten vegetables on our bagels, approximately 3 little slimey cucumbers is not acceptable ...and every table is dirty. I hope the management is paying attention, the parking lot is packed so it's definitely not the location...it's your employees."}
{"text":"They have one of the best bagels in town but lack in customer service and speed. Just a little improvement on that part."}
{"text":"Although I have had a few instances where service has not been five out of five the vast majority of the time this place is attentive, fast, and organized. 

The staff, especially the older ones ( I say older because there are young college kids working here), are excellent, EXCELLENT. 

I go here probably twice a week and let me say, it cannot compare to any other einsteins. The customer service is supreme; I think it's the managers or shift supervisors that I always see in the morning and I know I can trust I will get the right order, in time to rush my butt off to work, and won't get to work disappointed about my breakfast. 

If you are going to stop anywhere on your way to class or whatnot, I suggest this place especially over Starbucks in the morning!"}
{"text":"My favorite bagels, hands down.  This store will be closing in the spring with the rest of the plaza, so I will have to go out of my way for these bagels, which may or may not happen.   This probably explains why the store is so dirty an in such disrepair.  But, the bagels are not cloyingly sweet like Panera, and not nearly as much of a calorie bomb."}
{"text":"The vanilla hazelnut coffee is the highlight for sure, the food is pretty average.  The service here really sets them apart though... Everyone is very friendly and helpful.  Shout out to the manager David and the other guy who works there (forget his name), they always remember my order and chat it up in the early AM."}
{"text":"It's hard to find something I don't love about Einstein. It's open early, has a drive thru, has lots of options for bagels, shmears, and sandwiches, has a very good cold brew, and now they have shmearfuls, which are small, cream cheese filled bagel bites and they are excellent. 

The one draw back is that they do run out of certain bagels more often than I wish, and they really need to do a better job with the nova lox, which barely has any lox on it and sometimes hardly any onion/capers/tomatoes."}
{"text":"I'd rather give this place three stars...so why 4? Because of the friendly service.

I love bagels.  I like the selection they offer and the espresso drinks as well. 

Yes the service is a bit slow, yes they have messed up my order but you know what? They fixed their mistake without any attitude or rolling of eyes. I like that. And you know what? Friendly goes a long way. How can you be mad at someone who apologizes for their mistake and fixes it right away? You can't, unless you are a monster.

The bagels are good, always perfectly toasted and buttered. The staff takes awhile to make drinks, maybe they don't make a lot of lattes or maybe they need to brush up on their faster pace skills. The drinks take FOR-EVA...but they are always tasty.  And it seems that the specialty feature lattes are constantly changing and I order those, so maybe it's a \"how do I make this new drink?\" Issue and not a pace issue. 

Now I said everyone here is nice. I meant that except for one employee.  Guess who that employee is?  Oh it's the GM!! That woman is a B rhymes with witch. I was in utter shock when I found out that this unpleasant individual was the GM!! 

Scenario: I ordered a strawberry banana smoothie for my person. It's a Saturday at noon.  The bagel pickings were slim and they still have four more hours until close. Is anyone making bagels?  Bueller? Bueller? The associate starts to make the smoothie and realizes oh there are no bananas. Who used the last banana? Hint: whoever used the last banana could have said \"Hey we are out of 'naners!\" And someone could have WALKED across the parking lot to Albertsons to get more because not sure if anyone read the beverage menu board but STRAWBERRY BANANA SMOOTHIE is a prominently displayed drink choice. You need bananas for that and conveniently a grocery store is right there, like right there!!! My person doesn't want just a strawberry smoothie or a mixed berry smoothie. So I asked to just get a refund. They call over the person eating their lunch in the store which brings me to, hey you are kind of busy, think you can jump in and help instead of stuffing your face ignoring the fact that there is a line??? This person (a woman) goes to give me change and I said wait can't you put it back on my card? I paid with a credit card. She says oh I forgot to ask you if you wanted it on your card but I already did it and I am going to give you change. So I asked her if she would put it on my card since that is an option. She sighed very heavily, rolled her big, stupid eyes at me and went on to charge me for another drink on my card and had to void that one plus return the first one. In my head I was thinking, if this place wasn't around the corner and if everyone wasn't so nice I'd never come here again if this were my first time here. I didn't know that was the GM, they went and sat back down after \"helping, not helping\" me. I was appalled, there was still a line and cream cheese tubs in a bus bucket teetering on the cooler edge that needed to be put out and displayed, but they got busy and the employee doing that task jumped behind the counter to HELP. You'd think the GM (who I didn't know was the GM at the time) would maybe take the what 3 minutes it would take to put them away instead of sitting back down to eat? 

I went in today and the nice manager with the long blonde pony tail, I wish I knew her name...was there.  I thought she was GM she's always helpful and pleasant and I wanted her to know, listen you have a manager here who isn't exactly welcoming, you need to coach her on her people skills because if I wasn't a regular and didn't know that it's normally a pleasant experience here, I'd never come back.  She told me that woman was the GM. My mouth involuntarily fell open in shock. I couldn't believe it. The GM is acting like that? Wow. And I noticed a we're hiring sign on the window.  It makes me wonder who would want to work for this woman? Are they having a hard time keeping employees? If you treat a customer like she did me and she thought that was acceptable behavior what does she treat her employees like. I felt bad for the entire staff.

I hope the GM sees this. (Maybe customer service is not your forte...or maybe you need to work very hard on your people skills, I get the impression you are new, if you need some coaching on how to deal with people please respond to my review and I will be happy to set up a time to get together to go over basic customer service behaviors with you. I am very serious.)"}
{"text":"Manager PLEASE!! Oh, there is no manager at this location on Sundays (most likely the busiest day of the week!)   Not only is the order ALWAYS wrong, the restaurant is absolutely filthy, and frequently they are out of bagels with have no desire to bake more. Why is it that with 4 \"workers\" standing behind the counter doing nothing, yet the paying customers must get napkins to wipe down the dirty tables, wiped spilled drinks off the floor, and clear the trash off the tables from the previous customers?? I wouldn't let my dog into the disgustingly dirty bathrooms there.  Two weeks ago I witnessed an Einstein's worker take muffins to customers at their table.  When the customers stated that they did not order muffins, the worker picked up the muffins off the table and put them back in the case to be sold! Like I said, \"Manager PLEASE!\""}
{"text":"Easy parking, served immediately, enjoyed my bagel and tasty coffee, plenty of seating, and clean tables. No complaints."}
{"text":"This review has nothing to do with the food. The staff here is terrible including the supervisor in the maroon shirt that always looks angry! Most are unprofessional, dirty, and grouchy. They let their regulars cut, they get nasty with each other in the middle of ringing you up, they burn their bagels sometimes, and not to mention totally violate FLSA. I had one person in particular make my sandwich and then sing that they love working during their break. Are you kidding me? 

I've submitted two complaints on their site... one for ordering a southwest turkey sausage bagel thin sandwich only to return to work with an asparagus mushroom sandwich (exact same thing happened to my friend; we went together) and then because they served me a sandwich on a burnt, stale, cardboard cracker bagel. I've received a coupon for a free sandwich each time.

The only reason I go back is because I can get here and back within my break and/or lunch and when I'm lucky enough... the guy with the ponytail is working. He is super friendly and makes the yummiest sandwiches so kudos to him!"}
{"text":"I've always had a smile on my face when someone brings a box of Einstein bagels and smears to the office. I really enjoyed the bagels, honey almond or strawberry shmear. However, customers just need to stay ordering on the menu of what Einstein's is good at which are just bagels and shmears. Their coffee is not good and I ventured off to ordering a bacon and spinach egg sandwich one morning and I only ate half of it. It was ok, but I wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"I paid a visit to this Einstein Bagels location recently and I was pretty grossed out. We walked in and placed an order for a toasted bagel with schmear. The employees were not polite and acted as if they did not want to be working and there weren't very many customers. While waiting for our order, I paid a visit to the restroom and I clearly was disgusted. It was so so dirty that it felt like I was at a gas station. 

Then when I walked out to the restaurant waiting, I realized there was a common theme. The whole restaurant was dirty - the floor looked like it hasn't been mopped or vacuumed in weeks and the top of the counter where you pick up your order was full of crumbs! The lady who gave us our bagels practically threw it at us with her back to us. 

We left and I started eating my bagel and they burnt my bagel. They probably used the same utensil to put my husband's schmear and my schmear. I had a strawberry schmear and he had a regular one and I can taste that it didn't just taste like strawberry. 

I ate half of the bagel and threw away the rest. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Fast service, clean inside and out, friendly staff, good food. Very comfy tables inside and courtyard with lots of tables. Coffee is FANTASTIC as always!"}
{"text":"What do I look for from a good Bagel shop.....

- Fresh Bagels.

- Quick Service.

- Tasty Cream Cheese.

This location has it all.....enough said.

Will I return?  You bet."}
{"text":"Einstein Bros at Rural and University has been so generous with the nonprofit organization I work. They've donated snacks for our volunteers for years, and each time they are so easy to work with and provide more than enough to keep our volunteers happy. 

When I stop in as a customer, the staff is consistently friendly and the food is consistently fresh and good. Mmm, I'm going to have to go get a pumpkin bagel with pumpkin schmear now..."}
{"text":"I'm always impressed with the staff here. There could be five people or 30 people in line and they just move it along. Nice!

I like the bagel sandwiches... both breakfast and lunch. But really, the garden veggie cream cheese is the BEST!!! Love the fresh bagels :)"}
{"text":"Horrible service here. No customers were there and there was one young kid behind the counter who couldn't talk and chew gum at the same time!  I was shorted 1 bagel in my bakers dozen, paid for a tub of butter and it wasn't put in my bag, no receipt was given to me. New staff needed as well as training!"}
{"text":"Service has been only okay all three times we came here. Order was wrong 3/3 times. General manager gave me a free drink, but with a poor attitude; that doesn't make up for $20 of mistakes. We will no longer come here. Also, $9 for egg, cheese and a bagel? Too much."}
{"text":"Always terrible customer service especially from the manager. Can't tell you how many times I've stopped by around 830 in the morning and they are out of bagels. Place is a complete cluster"}
{"text":"Surreal experience...

Umm ... shoulda gone with the other reviews. But I was in the area and had a craving for a bagel even though it was 3:30 in the afternoon. How bad can it be right?

I walked in to find the place deserted except for 4 staff huddled in deep conversation behind the counter.  They scatter like high schoolers caught smoking by the bleachers when I approach.  One turns and asks what I'd like. I tell her 6 bagels and she turns and walks away. 

A guy then comes over and asks what kind. I tell him it doesn't matter and can I get them sliced. There's whispering between him and another girl and then he goes to the cash register and rings me up. I stand waiting, waiting, checking my phone. 

I wonder what's taking so long and see they're cutting them with a knife. I ask if the machine is broken and he says no we just cleaned it. 

Never here again


Who owns this place?
Is it some kind of money laundering front?
How do they stay in business?"}
{"text":"im dont eat breakfast unless im really hungry or if its to early for lunch on the weekends. so i dont come very often for a bagel. i do come when we have a breakfast theme event at work and ill get a box of assorted bagels and a breakfast sandwich (bacon and egg). my favorites are the chocolate chips and the cinnamon sugar bagel. i love that they are open early since i start work at 7:00 am. make sure to sign up online for emails since they give you a free breakfast sandwich on your birthday"}
{"text":"Normally, I have sworn by this location for good bagels but lately, their service and their FUNKY ATTITUDES have made me not only pissed off but giving them a straight up 1!  I asked for a toasted bagel w/nova lox and asked if my onions could be thin cut. Their manager has given me thin cut onions any time I've ever come in up until recently.  There is no manager within earshot and these hateful counter people that they have currently haven't a clue on what customer service is!

They get a 1 for shitty counter service!"}
{"text":"Bad service formals. They messed up my bagel twice. These reviews are now playing when they said it was bad here."}
{"text":"I normally only give good reviews but I was extremely disappointed with my customer service here. I came in on Thanksgiving and it seemed like the young lady at the front was lost, and just overall a bad experience. I ordered the ham and Swiss breakfast sandwich. Well...my bagel didn't have any ham on it so it was an egg and cheese sandwich...which I got charged 7 dollars for and could have made at home for 2 dollars max. While I was there, it was sad to see another customer had their order given to someone else and then she had to wait for her order to be done again but without what she wanted because they gave away the last bagel she specifically ordered. Overall, I have to agree with the reviews here. Einstein, fire your management  and reevaluate all of your employees. This is a good chain but this specific place blows. Felt like my service was worse than a McDonald's and you know what ...the food was just as pathetic. One star, maybe two on a good day."}
{"text":"The bagels were delicious! I bought their bakers dozen and got a variety of bagels along with their onion/chives and plain cream cheese. 

The staff was friendly to help with my questions (since it was my first time there) except the cashier. I had a groupon code and he had no idea how it worked, so he was frustrated and very unpleasant. He made me feel like it was ME that was holding up the line (of two people). I asked for a receipt and he said \"it didn't print one\". Uh.. what?  I just turned around and left.

I went in excited and went out feeling disappointed in their service, but I did feel better after the first bite of the bagel."}
{"text":"The best Einstein location in Summerlin. Always in and out with ease and professionalism from the staff. I usually go on Mondays as they have a dozen bagels for $7! I have never ordered a specialty bagel sandwich but I would recommended for any bagel lover who wants a bulk deal."}
{"text":"On our way to an A's game at Phoenix Municipal Stadium, we were on a hunt for breakfast. Our pre-yelped stops were way off the beaten path and we wanted to get to the stadium somewhat early. We found this place in the shopping plaza somewhat nearby. We were quite suprised to find that the place was packed!!! With a line! and a great smelling bagel smell filling the room. We were quite happy to find that there were bagel sandwiches with eggs and there were even wraps. We both ordered bagel sandwiches with turkey sausage and egg and cheese. We opted for different bagels. The bagels were warm soft and fresh. SOOOO YUMMY!!! I would highly recommend. The prices are a bit up there if you are looking for just a quickie breakfast, but way better than fast food. 

Check it out."}
{"text":"Bagel was great, however there is lack of speed. 2 bagels took over 10 minutes to get. Also they aren't big on following protocols. Watched a guy come out from where he was making sandwiches with gloves to change the coffee, touch his hat, touched a trash can. Never saw him change his gloves."}
{"text":"I don't usually go to this location but I was in the area today so I stopped. I can say now I won't be going back again. The people making the food behind the counter were throwing bagels to each other, toss the eggs and bacon on to the bagels, one guy even stopped making sandwiches several times to adjust his hat , wipe his face with his hands and then Ruffles his hair. Then he went right back to making sandwiches without washing hands eww. 
I didn't eat the sandwich they made I threw it away. If you eat here just watch the way the prepare your food"}
{"text":"I like to come to Einsteins in the morning for their breakfast sandwiches. The Chorizo Sunrise is my favorite! It does have a kick of spice to it but it's amazing! The Farmhouse is also good as well. The blueberry muffin - amazing! 

Everything here is exceptional except I really didn't enjoy their coffee. I just go next door to Starbucks for that. I've noticed that it does take a while during the weekdays to get out the food but during the weekend, it doesn't seem as busy here. 

Sometimes there are even bogo coupon offers for their sandwiches, win - win!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at this location. Everytime I stop in I am greeted with a smile. Thanks guys for starting my mornings off on a good note."}
{"text":"Much better than the one off Cave Creek Road this location had plenty of bagels ready for sale. somewhat crowded three employees and I was greeted right away. Monday they run a 13 bagel for $6 special"}
{"text":"This has become my go to spot in the morning on my way to work. Fully stocked now and friendly staff. Glad to see the improvement!"}
{"text":"I normally love Einsteins, but not this location.   I ordered a salad, which took forever for them to ring me up and make it.   I got it to go...big mistake.  When I opened the box, the lettuce leaves were whole.   Not cut up, not in an a size that would fit into anyone't mouth and half the chicken was in long strips.  My fault for not getting a knife while I was there.  Have you tried to tear up lettuce when it is under a pile of other ingredients?  That will be my first and last time at this location!"}
{"text":"Usually go to Einstein's at Greenway or Tatum but went here this am around 10:30.  Out of the Cranberry bagels, my wife's favorite.  This has happened before so I commented that this is the only Einstein's where they seem to run out of bagels.  The response (with attitude) was \"So, do you want another bagel, or not?
Poor management, poor customer service, no more me!"}
{"text":"$3 for a bagel with cheese!

$8 for a turkey sandwich!
I can buy a 5lb turkey and feed a family of 4 for that price.

Parking is a witch!

Go to Walmart and buy a bag of bagels and cream cheese :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I came on the 4th July to get coffee. I love their Vanilla latte. He waited in the \"express coffee line,\" for quite a while before someone finally told him he needed to wait in the regular queue. What a joke. Then he waited in that long queue to order just the coffee, all in all about 20 minutes for coffee, then you pay at the register next to where you order then you go back to the beginning of the food counter and pick up your food. It was a disaster to say the least. I've been here before and to have to go backwards to get your food is really inefficient. The whole establishment runs quite poorly. I have been to other Einstein Bagels who operate very well and I am most sure why this one doesn't. It's a bit disappointing as I really enjoy their bagels and some of the other breakfast options."}
{"text":"Service is slow.the food is good ( not too complicated ) I wish they would be a little more organized.I ate the bagel asparagus on thin ET bagel.it was great."}
{"text":"i really hate to do this, but i have to. service was slower than slow. my bagel + cream cheese was super skimpy on the cream cheese. turkey chili was lukewarm and not as good as it should have been. the staff seemed gloomy and sad. it just wasn't a good experience. it really is too bad, i haven't had lunch at a einstein's in forever and i was hoping it would be as good as i remember it."}
{"text":"all i can say is they cut g's bagel. i was explicitly clear in my order: one plain bagel as it is. no cutting, no toasting, just a normal bagel please, with plain cream cheese on the side. 

they cut g's bagel anyway. and just because saturday was my lucky day, the plain bagel they cut and smothered with an excessive amount of cream cheese was the last one.

my bagel was ordered toasted, but received un-toasted. i can't say i really cared. but when i order the bagel in its natural state, i really want to receive it that way. please. and seriously,  who runs out of plain bagels at 9 am on saturday?!"}
{"text":"ugh, this place was a total cluster this morning. all i wanted was a bagel box so i could bring in breakfast for the team at work. every einstein i've ever been to has pre-made boxes with a baker's dozen all prepped - you pick 2 tubs of cream cheese, pay and go on your merry way. not this one. so i get in line and wait. apparently because i'm not a regular i can't order in the same line the regulars can order - i got redirected to a different line. when i got to the new line i waited patiently (again) for someone to pay attention to me -it took awhile, but finally i got some attention. mid order, as my bagel box was being filled, the employee got derailed by a customer angry that her order hadn't been remade yet . then everything came to a screeching halt in the order-taking/order-making area while no less than 5 employees tried to figure that scenario out. 

the baskets for every \"normal\" bagel - honey whole wheat, asiago, plain, etc. were empty. it was 7:45 am and the store seemed quite unprepared for friday traffic. there isn't adequate signage and the flow of the facility is just confusing - there's really no way to tell where to go to order vs. pay and there is no good \"waiting\" area for people to stand in while waiting for their food which creates a massive traffic jam. 

the bagels themselves were fine, as was the cream cheese. my iced latte tasted like coffee grounds. yuck! i wish i had spent $21 elsewhere."}
{"text":"This location is a mixed bag.  The people are super super nice working there and Shawn behind the counter is very nice and a great asset to the store as he has a great attitude and big smile for everyone.  Jessie the manager is very nice as well.  However..... I seem to have some problems when I go there.  Not sure if it is me or a dark cloud over my head or my luck of the draw but I have had a number of times where I have had the wrong order when I get to my store.  Being that I own a business and I am there ALOT of the time by myself, it is not convenient for me to run back and fix the bagel.  The other complaint that I have is that (like a few above) I swear they are the cheapest Einsteins with their cream cheese.  For the love of God, PUHLEEZ put some cream cheese on the bagel where it is actually not just a thin veneer that soaks into the bagel so that by the time I get to my business, I have just a kinda wet looking bagel.  True, I get the bagel thins.. maybe they think I WANT a little amount of cream cheese or maybe they think I NEED a little bit of cream cheese?  Or is it that that is the way that those bagels get served?  it has happened sooo many times that I almost have given up hope that I will get enough on there.  Then I feel like a pig asking for more.  .. I just want a \"normal\" amount.

The one positive is that, even tho I literally go there every day, they never embarrass me like.. \"hey, you again?\".. and their bagels are good and they ALWAYS have the everything bagel which is the only one I get.  I guess I am a creature of habit.. lol.. 

I will still continue to go there as it is convenient but these are just a few things that if they changed them, they would be a great bagel shop.. :)"}
{"text":"Weekly visitors to Einstein's. Recently just changed our weekly visit to this location.  Went in there today and were told on our large multiple item order we couldn't use a coupon and still get the senior discount. What a rip off especially when our old favorite Einstein's would happily honor both. Disappointed with the customer service."}
{"text":"Went in on my work break shortly after 12 pm.. There was still plenty of bagels to choose from... Staff was friendly and fast... Was in and out!"}
{"text":"This place was HECTIC this morning, yet the staff handled it gracefully. There was even a man complaining BEHIND the counter about the coffee and they took it in stride. 

Additionally, Taylor is wonderful. He creates a personal connection to the patrons which approach his register and even when stress levels are high, he helps you out with a smile. 

You're appreciated. :)"}
{"text":"We have eaten here for breakfast a lot the past year or so. We've always had good service and the food is always delicious. Sometimes it's a little busy, but we can grab a table and when our food is ready someone will bring it to us."}
{"text":"Went today with my son for lunch at about noon. They were out of most bagels. Had a few on trays just out of the oven but they were all burnt. They were putting them out anyway. I ordered a turkey bagel sandwich which normally comes with chive cream cheese.  I asked for regular cream cheese, twice, both when I ordered and when I paid. Got the chive cream cheese anyway. The spinach on mine also looked old as it was soggy. I had this order to go and I was already out at my car when I discovered my sandwich being wrong. I went back in and asked if they would remake it. This is why I took away more stars: rude, rude and rude. Also, I am kind of picky when it comes to cleanliness and my food...not going back here. Shame too because I love Einsteins.  I do want to add that one of the employees, a cashier was very nice. Wish I knew her name, she deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has a 2.5-star rating but you pretty much know what you signed up for. We loved my lox and turkey bagels, will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy! I am a huge bagel eater...any and every kind of way so Einstein's is the perfect quick and easy breakfast place for me! Love the huge selections of bagels. There are so many and they all look and sound delish!! They have cream cheese and juices that you can buy. Loved the onion and chives flavor it was yummy. They have thintastic bagels and they are the perfect amount of bagel!!! Love the selection of drinks and the prices are great! Definitely beats the other quick breakfast options!!"}
{"text":"I wish they opened this Einstein years ago.  Very handy as it's on my way to work, and I am not a big breakfast eater.  Bagel & cream cheese is the perfect breakfast!"}
{"text":"How long could it possibly take to toast a bagel?  Apparently 20 freaking minutes.  Then when you get it's the completely wrong bagel with a bunch of nastiness on it that you didn't even order.  I went here twice thinking it might have just been a bad day..but No!  It's just bad.  All the time!
If you can't get a bagel right it's time to find another job.  Seriously. Super sucky!"}
{"text":"Even though I've only rated this place with 2 stars, I still come here pretty frequently b/c its the only bagel place convenient to me.  I've never really had a stellar experience here but I keep hoping for one!  I do really like the bagels but they always seem to skimp on the cream cheese.  I used to love Einsteins because they would liberally cover the bagel but now its so thin I can see the bagel underneath or a quarter of it has no cream cheese at all.  I'm from NY- I need lots of cream cheese! The service is always friendly, but usually very slow.  So lack of cream cheese + slow service = 2 stars.  Hopefully it's just because they're still relatively new and will step up their game in the months to come :)"}
{"text":"I love einstein bagels, but this location blows. Dude is so slow and lazy. Asked for an asiago bagel...no asiago, cuz they were all burned. Asked for a plane bagel...no plain...mopping at the same time of ringing me up...not comin here again."}
{"text":"I LOVE EINSTEINS...I do.. I can't deny it. 
Their breakfast panini's are wonderful and always hit the spot. 
they also have a wonderful Iced Chai that makes me very happy!
They also have these under 400 Cal breakfast sandwichs that are 
small yet satisfying.. 

The only dislike I have with them at this point is that their prices have 
just increased a little bit. I know.. I know.. Inflation.. blah blah blah but seriously.. Why you gotta act like that Einstein!!! 

Luckily for them Im such a fan that I will still come.."}
{"text":"Yummy place 2 get a quick bite if u r craving 4 bagels! Especially on Mondays they have a special. Dozen bagels of ur choice or grab 2 go 4 only 7.00. THAT'S A DEAL!"}
{"text":"This is probably the WORST einsteins ive ever been to and it sucks to write this because I am a huge fan of them. But the one on campus always gets my order wrong, the bagels are not fluffy and theyre tasteless and the staff are slow. Not going back to that one ever again"}
{"text":"Hubby ran in for what was supposed to be a quick trip for bagels to go. While I sat in the parking lot I didn't note how long I waited, but it was longer then usual and hubby confirmed the long wait inside.
The pumpkin bagels didn't seem fresh, and had waaaay too much cream cheese to the point where globs and globs were dropping out of them onto our shirts.
Don't think I will go back as there are too many options out there and a bagel is easy enough to make perfect."}
{"text":"Thank God for Einstein's. The weekend morning blues are quickly abated by their creamy cheesy goodness. Bagels are often warm and fresh, especially on those weekend mornings when traffic at the store is heavy and turnover is high. 

Compared with the real deal in NYC or even some of its independent counterparts around Phoenix, it can't keep up. But, purely for reasons of convenience and accessibility, these pretty good bagels and sandwiches are fantastic."}
{"text":"I usually go to the other Einsteins' but was going to Frys so stopped here. The manager at the time...Jennifer.. worked with me on a discount offer I had even though i ordered it the wrong way...which was impressive! A lot of places would say use it next time! ...4 stars for HER....BUT...the very next week I went there again with a 20percent discount coupon in the mail and it was quite different!! Jennifer took my order and was WONDERFUL...remembered me and got my order right. When I went to pay there was a GRUMPY and frowning gentleman who rang me out. I asked if he was manager...he grumbled \"Yea\" and I said I wanted to compliment her for her customer service the week before. He TOTALLY IGNORED me....even though there was NO ONE ELSE in line....and just told me my price. He didn't offer my receipt so I could leave feedback and after doing the math in my head did not even give me the 20percent off! I assume he was the  owner because ususally a manager doesnt treat you like that. The atmosphere in the place was SOOO different than it was last week....where they were happy, freindly and talking to me! This time....even with NO ONE ELSE IN LINE... he flat out ignored me and treated me like I was wasting his time!! I am going back to my other Einsteins...even if it out of the way....coz I refuse to give him a DIME of my money...."}
{"text":"Just makes your day better when you have friendly service and a yummy bagel!"}
{"text":"Great service by all employees. They're all so friendly and go out of their way to remember your name. It should be easy cause I'm a regular.

Food is so-so, but what do you expect from a bagel. I haven't had their sandwiches. I dig the iced coffees but make sure you specify \"iced\". It sometimes gets confused with 'frozen'."}
{"text":"When it comes to Einstein's Bagels they're good for the price you pay and the diverse spreads you can get. I only come here to get bagels and spread to go for my staff. Each time everything tastes just as before. I recommend coming early to get the fresher bagels. Coming later in the day the bagels aren't as fresh and can be a bit hard. 

I try my hardest not to stay there because I hate how the staff can be extremely rude sometimes. Even when they take your order it seems like they're ready to throw in the towel and quit at any moment. 

Overall, I give then 3 stars because they do offer decent food. Service needs work though. 

Happy Dining, 
JT"}
{"text":"Great employees!  

Black dude making specialty coffee drinks  (named Larry Walker?) was super nice, friendly, and quick at getting all of the impatient customer's drinks made :) 

Another really cool black dude (couldn't see his nametag) was quick to refill the self-serve coffee dispenser when he realized it was empty... that's good customer service.

Coffee drinks tasted good too, so no complaints here."}
{"text":"I ordered a sandwich and received someone else's order.  All lease 5 other customers received the wrong order.  When I told the lady, she apologized but didn't offer any compensation.  For a place called Einstein, they sure weren't very smart."}
{"text":"Just wanted 2 dozen bagels. Usually they have the grab and go. They told me to wait off to the side while they prepare the boxes. While waiting, I noticed they helped the 3 people behind me before I finally said something and received my order. Service was good, just note that it may take you some extra time."}
{"text":"I bought 6 bagels.  The counter staff was efficient and friendly.  I was in and out in about 1 minute.  This store is a bit smaller than other Einstein Brothers around town and the selection seemed to be a bit less.  Nevertheless, they had what I wanted.  

I wish Einstein would bring back plain salt bagels.  I'd rather have plain salt than their pretzel bagel, but they're still good."}
{"text":"I'd rate this a 3 normally, but the young lady who waited on me was so pleasant that I'm giving them the extra star for exemplary service.

I do wish they had regular salt bagels, but I'll make do with the pretzels bagels (with the salt) that are quite tasty!

The parking can get a bit tight in that plaza at times, so it's not the most convenient location.  On the other hand, I jump right on the 215 and I'm hone in 6 minutes.  Not bad!"}
{"text":"My favorite items from Einstein's are their Paninis, but this location doesn't serve any!  If you like their bagels and beverages you're fine, but I was largely disappointed they did not serve my favorite item.

Also be careful at reading the directories when finding this stand, they say it's located in Concourse A, but I found it in B.  Get it together McCarren."}
{"text":"Taste like nasty rye bread bagels. Have had way better, but then again I'm from the East Coast. Go to Dunkin Donuts they're better for a chain that makes bagels."}
{"text":"I've got to be honest if this place wasn't next door to coffee bean, I would never go to this location.  We love Einstein bagels but I agree with the opinion that the service at this restaurant is extremely subpar! It is dirty but that is a reflection on the staff,  they never have enough bagels. It would be one thing if it wasn't the same every time you went in but at some point one would think they could do a better job of figuring out the number of bagels to make.  I have gone to the Einstein on Alma School andQueen Creek much,  much better.  All I can say is they're lucky they are in the location they are.  I can't believe people would ever make it back as repeat business once treated so poorly and food not prepared well!"}
{"text":"WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT BRING YOUR MONEY TO THIS LOCATION. I hate to say that because I absolutely love Einstein bagels. I'm not one to complain since I know the struggle of working in the food industry. However, every time I come to this location, their service gets worse and worse. They have no sense of customer service or team work whatsoever. Waited in line for 10 minutes without my order being taken. While all this was happening, there was one poor woman working the line making bagels and another woman just walking around doing nothing not even helping her teammates. Of course there were 10 other people waiting for their bagels and all the coffee was out. I always come back to this location because I love the bagels. I've had it with the terrible customer service and I am shocked that Einstein Bagels does not offer a corporate customer satisfaction survey. Do not go to this location, make a trip to a different one or go to Starbucks or something. Absolutely atrocious service."}
{"text":"I've been coming here a lot lately to get sandwiches for my mom and I. They are always super kind and are super on top of it. Even today when there was a line out the door they were giving people out as fast as they could and we're super nice to everyone. I recommend this location to anyone"}
{"text":"As usual it is service with irritation. Every time we visit the staff seems put out that we order a bagel with eggs, claiming eggs take awhile. I always say that this will be my last visit, but this time it really will.

Visit was on Saturday 12/17 at 9:19a if Einstein's cares to look at the lady who was taking orders with such a poor attitude."}
{"text":"Good bagels and a fair price. I wait for the coupon in the Sunday paper and buy the 'hate to wait' dozen with 2 cream cheese tubs. I slice them and freeze them, pulling out a bagel to toast whenever I am in the mood. There are two EB bagels near me, but I like this one. They are usually not quite a packed and you can get in and out quickly."}
{"text":"I love Einstein brothers bagels. I visit their stores across the valley 1 to 2 times a week. Always enjoy their food.

However, this store on Val Vista is the absolute worst! Their staff is rude, uncommunicative, unresponsive, and downright unfriendly.

This morning I came for a dozen bagels, everyone in the store greeted me, so they knew I was there, I was the only one in the store at the time, then they proceeded to ignore me.

Then they help the next person who walked in the store behind me first, before helping me with my order. What's up with that?

I truly dislike waste, but because they did not communicate with me properly, when I ordered a lox sandwich, they had to remake it because it was not toasted and not on the correct bagel.

I will visit many Einstein bagel brothers stores in the future, but never ever this store again. It was not just today, it is always this way with this store."}
{"text":"Typical Einstein Bagel place - but with ruder people.  Actually heard an employee mutter \"F&$#\" when a customer came in through the door.  Obviously, customers are disruptive to her texting.  It's out of my way - so definitely won't make a trip back there.  Many other bagel places with better bagels and friendlier servers."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could .  I went in today to talk to the manager regarding catering for an event.  it's seems they close 5pm and I get there at 5:08.  why, because I just got out of work.  Anyways, I tap on the window and make a gesture that I have a quick question.  The lady comes to the window and says. \"We're closed, don't you understand!\"  

Really??? this is customer service?  I'm not asking to buy anything because I know cashier systems go off.  I just have 1 question. Well guess what? I rather go somewhere else then leaving my money to people who are going to get paid with it anythings."}
{"text":"This review is totally based on service!  I love their bagels!  When they have some made...

There is always a line to the door or out the door.  They only sell bagels so how can you be out of them?  Even plain bagels???  This location is not run very well.  We now drive to the Eastern Ave location instead of going right down the road this much closer location.  It's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time after it being hyped up from a couple people, and was extremely disappointed with their service and lack of common sense. I ordered a blueberry bagel sans cream cheese due to being lactose intolerant - which I made very apparent to the cashier. My boyfriend ordered the Turkey Bacon Avocado bagel sandwich on the cheddar jalapeño bagel. Not even two minutes after paying, one of the workers came up to me and told us that they were out of the bagel that my boyfriend had requested, when they clearly still had a basket full of them. We had to correct him, and wait longer for our food because of it. Finally, when my name was called, I was presented with a blueberry bagel WITH cream cheese, and a sausage, egg, and cheese sandwhich. I then told them that it wasn't necessary for them to correct their mistake, and that I just wanted a refund. The manager promptly responded and refunded me for my order, which has still not processed into my bank account days later. I still have a transaction for food I did not recieve in my bank account. Definitely will not be returning to this store, or the company ever again."}
{"text":"Very quick and lots of variety...the staff was super friendly too! They really have the system down despite a very long line, the food was ready before I even paid the bill."}
{"text":"Inside McCarren International Airport.
This little stand has a little fridge to grab ready-made items and drinks or you can order at the register. They serve breakfast all day and offer sandwiches, bagels with shmears, etc.. I haven't had a breakfast sandwich anywhere for a long time and I don't know why I did it here... bored at the airport, I guess..

It was pretty gross. I watched them microwave the egg and assemble it.. I had it on an asiago bagel (you can choose which bagel for your sandwich).. I couldn't pick it apart and say I liked any of it. Not even the bagel. 

I don't know if this is a reflection of what Einstein Bros Bagels are everywhere else or if it's an airport thing but I'm pretty much over it. I don't need to try another Einstein Bros to find out. It wasn't good at all. *Except those cookie poppers"}
{"text":"I can give it a 3 1/2 stars easy.

The wifey and I often come here on a Sunday morning as a breakfast ritual just to hang out and enjoy nice bite (and because BabyStacks Café nearby is always busy).  Funny enough, this Einstein is very occupied during the weekend!  A good size line and crowded tables often await us.  But no matter since the wifey needs her morning cup of Joe!  This location is a popular early destination for folks living nearby as well as those getting back on the road for the trek back to their home state.

Wifey is pretty basic when it comes to ordering, a cup of coffee, and a bagel (toasted) with a shmear.  Her bagel and flavor of shmear will vary by visit, but her cup of coffee is a constant.  She gets it often enough she's bought one of those refillable mugs from Einstein's, you get a nice size on it, plus it saves you in the long run on refills.  I myself am OK with the food there, I like a fresh toasted bagel with shmear, but I often go up to the menu board to get something.  Now, we all know that Einstein's does use microwaves for much of their food items because let's face it, there is no large kitchen there.  Much to my chagrin, things like their egg products and bacon and such they use gets nuked in the microwave.  So if you're looking for a fresh fried egg on your bagel (damn that sounds delicious), you're not going to find it here.  I've gotten a bagel sandwich with egg at Einstein's before and it's not usually one of my favorites.  I stick with a few things there.  For some strange reason I like their Chicken Salad deli sandwich.  To me it's yummy!  Chunks of chicken, grapes, almonds, and craisins in a vinaigrette dressing, topped with lettuce, tomato, and red onion on wheat?  Sign me up!  I like it very much, even for breakfast!  Another one of my favorites is the Thintastic Chicken Pesto bagel sandwich.  Sliced chicken breast strips, roasted tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil pesto on a thin bagel of your choice.  For not being a 100% in house made sandwich it is pretty good.  Most of their sandwiches come with a pickle, and a side of potato salad, fruit, or a bag of chips.  I opt for the potato salad most occasions because Einstein's actually makes one I like.

A bit of a downer for me is the pricing.  Einstein I guess can be considered 'gourmet', their prices reflect it!  Not the cheapest for a sandwich or any of their combos.  A sandwich combo will run in the $6 range, and that doesn't include a drink!  Luckily I just bum off some coffee from the wifey.  Even a basic combo of a bagel, shmear, and a small coffee will run folks back $3.99 plus tax.  If I get this combo I guarantee you I will be left HUNGRY.  And hungry boy = grumpy boy!  Compare this to the $3 Subway breakfast combo (6 inch breakfast sandwich and drink) right next door and you can see the gap in food portion.  I will give Einstein's their due though, the bagels are A-OK.

Service is usually good for us, as we often get the manager to take our order.  She's attentive, and quick on her toes.  The thing that takes the longest is actually getting our order.  But that's no problem, I get to hang out with the wifey longer."}
{"text":"While the food is good, getting catering from them has made me incredibly nervous not once, but twice. Both instances they have been late, once even being 20 minutes late. All the guy says is \"Sorry, I'm late\" when I have been told they have a dedicated catering driver. After one bad experience, you would think they would fix the second time. I gave them a second chance, but once again lateness occurred. Thankfully not as late as the first instance, but still late. If you want their catering, pick it up at the store."}
{"text":"Food is good but the customer service is terrible. It seemed like we were a bother to the person taking our order. Once you order then they send you down to another register to pay even before you receive your food. Why wouldn't you just pay at the same register that you ordered from? The process is silly. Not impressed with this place."}
{"text":"We were so excited when this location opened.  Finally!  An Einsteins in our little Cave Creek!  Despite the fact I am giving them two stars, we do go there often because, well it's Cave Creek and selection is low.  The food is good but so often, they have run out of a certain bagel or muffin or something else on a Sunday morning as if, *shock* they may actually be busy on a Sunday morning!  But the absolute worse thing is the fact that, not one time, nope, never have they once gotten our to go order right.  I have to double check every order now and they always have to redo it. 
One time, I was at the coffee bar filling my coffee when one of the girls was trying to get passed me so I let her through. I was the only one at the coffee bar but she chose THAT exact moment to remove all of the creamers without as much as an explanation. When I asked another girl, she replied \"oh we must refill them every (however often)\". BUT I AM STANDING RIGHt HERE!!  Another time, the \"kids\" were all doing their assigned jobs but no one was cashiering. After seeing the long line to pay was getting backed up, they all looked at me in horror when I asked who will get the register. 
Part of the problem is that the kids who work there, always seem distracted by one another. Not sure what to do about this."}
{"text":"I have always been an Einstein's Bagel fan and I'm sure I always will be, the bagels are very good the options are great but my complaint is regarding this specific location. I cannot put my finger on it exactly but the staff seems less than enthusiastic about their jobs and it comes off as rude at times. My first time at this location I was over charged for my food, the second time I was undercharged, the third time I asked them to cut my bagel in half and that one single request seemed to be way over their heads as I got it uncut. Now I don't even ask I go in order, get my food and leave right after my fill of attitude. I don't know, maybe because I don't make minimum wadge I guess I just don't understand but regardless they are there by choice and should represent the franchise properly and treat me like they appreciate the fact that I am spending my money there. Now I am not saying all of them are rude its only one or two of them but its consistent. The other locations are great, zero complaints but this one downtown in the Hyatt is sub par. I mean being that they are in a hotel one would think they would be aware of this but nope. However with that said its on the way to work so, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I thought the service was good...when we arrived they were slammed with a soccer team.  
The staff smiled and got us our food quickly, even with my special order. 
Food was great. 
Why only three stars....couldn't find it!! The store is tucked away, backing up to a different street than the address."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever and I wouldn't even bother with their drinks here, they're awful. Stick to Starbucks or Dutch bros if you want quality coffee."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a quick bagel but had to wait their computers were down. The manager could've announced it to those who were in line."}
{"text":"We waited an actual 20 minutes for two bagels this morning. One not even toasted. Asked for cream cheese twice. Got home to a bagel with a tiny bit of butter on it. I know it isn't a HUGE deal, but I haven't been feeling good today and I was really looking forward to it. Not going to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Einstein's is always a winner for coffee and breakfast when Starbucks is not around. This location was busy this Sunday morning and had not enough staff to run the place. They are doing the best they can though.

After our order and a 30 min wait the order we had for our farm house egg sandwich and coffee cheese cake was lost. So I went up to Dreya whom called out the orders to the back and went and got them herself to fulfill our order. Thanks Dreya you Rock and made Sunday morning great because you made my coffee too, a black and white mocha."}
{"text":"Waited in line to order a breakfast. When I reached the cash register, was told I had to go wait in a separate line in order to get food. Extremely rude staff. I walked out. For a place that is right next to the convention center, you think that they would strive for customer service."}
{"text":"SO tasty! The jalapeño cheddar is the best, but because of that it's always sold out! They are very generous with their smear too."}
{"text":"Bagel was good. But SOOOOO slow.

I came in Sunday morning at 850 am, I walked right up to the counter to order & was thinking \"wow that was quick\" but then I noticed there were like 6 people waiting for their food. I noticed two people in the back making the orders one would like take a break and get water. Then there were two cashiers just hanging out doing not much. 

Maybe make this process more efficient Einstein's?? Like Starbucks, the cashiers also help make the food? (Supply Chain Major here -- efficiency is key!!)"}
{"text":"It amazing how customer service can sometime be terrible.

 Complained about a bagel I took to go couple days before. Everybody recognize me since I get my bagels here 3 times a week. But the manager refused to to get my same order comp since I did not have my receipt. \" Store policy\"

If you clearly recognize and know your customer, if he always take the same thing for the past 3 years and complain one time. Please do not tell him: I cannot do anything without a receipt. And Yes, we are talking about $7 bagel.

To bad..... now my $85 monthly bagel budget just been cancel to your establishment. 

Since I will not return. I want to say Marc the older gentleman at the counter was the nicest person ever. Unfortunately  Management is not at the same level and if you make some rules(who's normal) maybe you have to understand as a manager, some situation are different and you should not go to an ego trip. Nobody who lives in this area is looking to get a free $ 7 bagel and as a customer, I am simply looking at a good product and a good service."}
{"text":"Dirty, disorganized, rude.
When I got my \"shmearfuls,\" one was cold, one was tepid, one was frozen solid. When I handed it to the girl behind the counter, she grabbed it from me, no apology, threw it out, and yelled at no one in particular for its replacement. 
I waited and watched as no one, in particular, did nothing, in particular, and finally spoke up.
\"So, you wanted them toasted?\"
\"I wanted them not frozen; it was frozen.\"
\"So, how did you want it?\"
\"Whatever the default is that is NOT frozen. I just do not want it frozen, please.\"

This is when she grabbed three of the little bagels, toasted them up goooood and toasty and gave them to me. \"Here you go, I gave you three. Sorry about that.\"
\"Thanks, that's ok.\"
No, it was not ok. Why do I say that? As I was waiting, I watched them screw up other orders. That place is not ok. Get better staff, or train the team, get more staff. Do something."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get bagels or breakfast sandwiches or even regular sandwiches. The bagels are fresh and tasty. 

We love walking here on a Saturday morning and sitting outside. Its nice to have a restaurant that you can walk too even though its a little far.

I really love to get the dozen bagels with schmear to bring to events. I love how the bagel box has a place to carry the schmear. Its cute and clever.

I love their pumpkin bagel in the fall. When I was pregnant, all I wanted was pumpkin and this with their honey nut cream cheese was divine! Oh I wish it was fall."}
{"text":"We did a huge order for the office. like 25 bagels and meals and drinks.... the whole nine yards. When we got the bagels they already had the schmere on them. Since we had to all take breaks over a 3 hour period to eat... they were gross. Extremely soggy. I do not understand why an over $100 order would be like that. I did not want about 4 tablespoons of schmere. We will never order again from here."}
{"text":"Good but certainly not exceptional. It's a chain, so the food is pretty standard. The employees could be happier and/or quicker."}
{"text":"Dirty. Can't believe the filth in this place. Bagel good, cold vanilla coffee thumbs down. So sweet it was gagging. Also they didn't make our drinks, just our bagel, then said they already gave us our drinks, which clearly they didn't.
Do not recommend and will never go back. 
Clean it up Einstein."}
{"text":"I love this bagel shop. Aside from being insanely crowded on weekend mornings (but what bagel place isn't?), I have no complaints. Even though the line can lead right out the front door, but with the efficiency of the employees, it never takes more than 5-10 minutes to get to the front of the line, and then my food is ready before I even have my cup filled with fountain soda :)"}
{"text":"Tasty food but awful service. The same employee who has helped me on my last two visits has a rude demeanor and makes me feel like she has a problem with me when all I come in for is my to-go order."}
{"text":"I have been to a number of Einstein Bros Bagels shops and the food is basically what you would expect- but I was particularly impressed with the service I got here.  I came here two mornings in a row pretty early when I was in town over the weekend. David was at the register and he was extremely helpful and seemed like he genuinely wanted to help us get the quickest and best service possible. When he saw that there were going to be several customers coming in unusually early, he rushed to the back to get another person to help him make the food while he took the orders so we wouldn't have to wait. He was helpful in making suggestions with any questions I had about the menu. Also, the service was very fast, I wasn't even able to start pouring my coffee before my bagel breakfast sandwich was ready and being handed to me.

The bagel sandwich was warm and tasted good and a little overpriced."}
{"text":"I just don't get it.  Corporate sends out free bagel coupons via email and the store manager doesn't make sure that he/she has enough staff working.  Two staff here and a line out the door. 

This has happened before too."}
{"text":"Like this place when I come to AZ on business, but for some reason if you go after 9pm they are always out of a lot of bagles. My fav is the green chile. Service is good and free wifi in the store. Nice for me to go and work and have a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Einstein's is very dependable in that their food is always good, fresh, and well, delicious. 

The only problem I ever have w/ this location is the crowd (when schools in)."}
{"text":"I decided to write this really quickly while I was still full from the deliciousness that is the Tasty Turkey. 

My sis used to work for Bruegger's Bagels back in the day and brought me home millions of bagels... this is how my obsession began (thanks for that Christine - probably has lead to my wheat allergy...) 

Anyway, the sandwich is served on an Asiago cheese bagel, I prefer the garlic one... tastes better with the chive cream cheese. Add cucumber, tomato, sprouts and of course turkey and you have yourself one tasty sammie. 

I only give 4 stars, 5 if my pickle wasn't always so shriveled. Also, 5 if you weren't so darn expensive. And, 5 if you were open past 4pm, some of us want to eat you for dinner!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service before our road trip! Fast and easy. Super friendly staff. Much appreciated before our long stint in the car!"}
{"text":"I came into this coffee shop to grab an afternoon coffee. While I was waiting in line I asked Alexis who was working the register  for the restroom key and she ignored me. It also was not busy there was one indecisive customer in front of me and I could not wait for the restroom. When I asked again she said that the bathroom was for customers only. Assuming that I wasn't going to purchase anything. She then wouldn't give me the key and walked me over and I explained that I did not want to wait in line when I needed to use the restroom: she just didn't say anything. When I ordered my coffee she didn't say thank you nor was she polite."}
{"text":"1. Worst Einstein's EVER. I don't know how they do it, but they manage to screw up my order EVERY SINGLE TIME. I kept going back because it's close and convenient but I'm done. Never going back again. The incompetence at this location is baffling. 

2. when someone asks for a bagel to be toasted, it should not come out as soft as it was when it went in. If you can't toast a bagel, close your doors, you are wasting your time. People are constantly having to ask you to toast bagels again. Do something different, ffs, bc what you're doing is clearly not working."}
{"text":"Einstein Bagels serve quite a few unique bagels that I enjoy and their Pepperoni Pizza bagel is a nice change from the regular pepperoni pizza. 

Unfortunately, the one at Memorial Union disappoints me. First of all, they are not like all other Einstein Bagels. They do not have the same offers and do not accept coupons like regular Einstein Bagel place. These coupons help me save a lot!

Their service is also disappointing. Being in the Memorial Union, you would expect that they are trained to deal with crowds, especially during lunch time. We went after the main lunch crowd, about 2.30pm and they were slow in making our order. We ordered two pepperoni pizza bagel. When they called my name, they realized that they only made one instead of two. 

I will only go to this particular one when I have no other choice."}
{"text":"Ouch! What happen here!

It's amazing what a turn over in staff can do for a business. After coming to this store for the past few years and having a good experiences almost every time, I'm sad to report this store has gone down the drain.

The bagel sandwiches are thrown together as if they were slop from a pig trough. The bagels had fallen apart once opened and the meats were cold.

My last experience, I was the only one In the store, however the 4 staff members behind the counter were more interested in talking about what they were doing that night. After ordering I waited a good 15mins for 2 bagels then another group came in and order around 8 items. 30mins later the people who ordered after me received all of there items before me!

The manager wasn't much help and said \"oh sorry, have a nice day\" 

I use to like this place, but now I'm done.
The staff before I think all got promoted to other stores. Big shame."}
{"text":"I usually enjoyed their bagels and now they even have wifi, but the btl avocado thin bagel...LAME, you seriously don't have wheat thin bagels?"}
{"text":"Well it's your not like it used to be at the price point sure his pictures are worth 1000 stories in this case pictures are worth seven dollars worth of."}
{"text":"I don't normally do Einsteins outside of this location but this location keeps my business with their great employees and amazing service.  Their food and coffee always meets expectations as well. 

I have only had one bad experience where both of my bagel sandwiches were wrong.  Appearently I got the guy who ordered before me meal.  I didn't realize it until I drove home.  Luckily I live 2 minutes away.  I drove back and they were able to correct the situation and were great about it.  No compensation was offered, but it wasn't a big enough inconvenience to me for me to need or want compensation.  Other might be different.  

I have also had enough positive experiences with this location to know that they are always on their game and mistakes do happen.  

I appreciate them handling my issues in a timely manner and their sincere apology. 

I will be returning when I get back into town."}
{"text":"I rather drive to a location across town then come to this Einstein Bagels.
They had 5 workers including 2 supervisors, they were all confused and did not understand what to do. 

My boyfriend and I ordered the lox bagel with extra capers and a side of potato salad along with a strawberry lemonade. They were busy so I didn't mind waiting a bit longer on their slow service but the workers were just rude.

We got here around 11 on Saturday and they were mostly out of their bagels with a handful of bagels. As we go your bagels, they did not put extra capers and forgot out salad and drink. They looked at us as if we were idiots when we were waiting for the rest of our food. The potato salad was already premade and they just had to take it out of the fridge but they made us wait another 5 minutes. Our drink took another 5-10 minutes, probably would have been finished with our meal if we didn't wait. 

Just don't waste your time coming to the location."}
{"text":"THE NICEST people work here.  They have such a great vibe that you want to just hang out here.  Doesn't hurt that Einstein Bagels are pretty damned good too.

This is the norm Einstein's so I'm not going to critique the food, but this location has the bomb employees!!"}
{"text":"Too bad their bagels are yummy- just the staff is unpleasant!!   Went to get a bagel, they did not call out my name for pick up. The bagel was sitting on their workbench for 10 min- then someone asked if I was waiting for something & I said, \"Yes, my order.\" The guy working asked my name then went hunting & found the bagel. He handed it to me, then I said the bagel is cold because they had set it aside after toasting it & was hard. I just wanted a bagel :(  I shouldn't have to feel bad for paying for a product & service that I had no part in making."}
{"text":"Besides the fact that this Einstein bagel does not carry my favorite spread (blueberry FOR THE WIN, haters gonna hate), this Einstein bagel especially stood out due to its outstanding customer service.

I ordered a mixed berry smoothie due to the fact that it is scorching hot outside...but the cashier put in strawberry banana smoothie. I kindly told the person who gave me my order and she apologized and immediately made a new smoothie for me..and FOR FREE. If that is not customer service, I honestly don't know what is."}
{"text":"Convenient neighborhood location, friendly staff, and decent bagels at this Einstein's location.  Located right next to the Starbucks, I used to frequent this Einstein's quite a bit for a morning bagel or to grab a box of bagels.  I stopped going once I found other bagel places to go to, but from time to time I still stop in because the other bagel places are a little out of the way.  The inside is a decent size enough to seat maybe about 20 people and they do have a few tables and chairs outside you can sit at as well.  The bagels are usually pretty tasty.  However, on a few occasions I've had my bagel over toasted almost burnt served to me or the employee sent my bagel down the bagel slicer at a weird angle resulting in weirdly shaped bagels.  Coffee here is mediocre, if you do get coffee from here the iced coffee is better than their hot brews.  Overall, this is an ah-okay place to get your bagel fix.  Nothing too spectacular but nothing too horrible either."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Einstein Bros Bagels from a friend who is in love with this store! And I couldn't agree more! The bagels here are so delicious. They taste freshly baked no matter what time of the day you go in. 

They offer a variety of breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals and have an array of desserts to choose from. They also have lots of different coffees you can get as well!

I would totally recommend this place to all of the bagel lovers out there!"}
{"text":"Service was PAINFULLY slow. Took 30 minutes for 2 paninis. I mean really? We saw that they were preparing everyone else's bagel orders before they finally got around to making our panini. When we checked our bag in the car, we found that the lady gave us the wrong order of chips. Incredibly disappointed with the service here. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"This Chandler location is near and dear to my heart. They offer an interesting layout, with a order window and pay window that is often not mentioned. 

The customer service here is great! And the speed is quick and consistent. There is plenty of seating and the two large conference tables make it excellent for groups of 7-10 people. 

The Farmhouse Sandwich definitely one of my go-to's. Pizza bagel is favorite order choice of mine as well. Blueberry bagel with butter is another instant classic. The amount of bagel shmear that they apply here is quite generous, which makes it even better paying $3.79 for a toasted bagel with cream cheese. 


If you are in the area, up early in the morning or in the late afternoon, stop by and grab your bagel fix! Coffee is great too :)"}
{"text":"Nothing too spectacular - just another bagel place. I got the good grains bagel w/ honey almond cream cheese (yummy) while others in my group got: the pizza bagel, thin bagel sandwiches, jalapeno w/ plain cream cheese, spinach florentine, and some holiday one that was super sweet.

Price wasn't anything too expensive."}
{"text":"Good value, great bagels & amazing service! I love the jalapeño bagel with jalapeño spread. Lights up my mouth for"}
{"text":"If you're looking for quick and cheap breakfast, this is your place. Tons of bagel options with an ever expanding menu and some really good breakfast sandwiches. You can be in and out within five minutes with a fresh orange juice and a toasted bagel. I've been coming here for quite a few years now and don't see that changing."}
{"text":"The people here are so rude!! I ordered a sandwich without capers but still got capers on it. No big deal until I brought it back to the woman who made it seem like I was asking her for the moon. She really didn't remake my sandwich but just took them off and handed it back to me. So sorry I made you do work when your store is empty....

I usually like this chain but this store sucks!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located near Starbucks, I can do bfast and pick up a dozen bagels pre packaged, pick my cream cheese and be on the road in just a few minutes.

The staff is helpful and they have the service down to a science here. I can't say how the bagels are since I didn't indulge this time but I'm sure they were as good &  consistently like their other locations.

I'll use this location again for the convienence."}
{"text":"There is no surprise here- it's a typical Einstein's Bagels....
I like Einstein's bagels but it's so weird to me because I love Noah's Bagels in San Francisco and these 2 places are siblings. But Noah's is always better to me....
Anyways, the Sesame seed Bagel with Lox (Smoked Salmon), plain cream cheese,capers,onions & tomato - So darn good!!!!!
Chocolate chip bagel - Yum!!!!
I do also enjoy when they carry the seasonal pumpkin bagel with veggie cream cheese spread.
Broccoli Cheese soup - OK 
They have new desserts called Poppers which are bagel bites.
Oreo Poppers : Bagel bites drenched in cream cheese frosting and then rolled in crushed oreos.
Lemon Poppers : Bagel bites drenched in lemon frosting and rolled in yellow lemon sprinkles.
They both sound good huh?? Well, sadly they are not!!!! The texture and the sweetness just don't mesh well. I won't be ordering this again but they have other baked goodies to eat anyways...."}
{"text":"They were out of bagels by 10am, again. No bagels is a consistent theme. Call ahead or get a better bagel at Fry's."}
{"text":"Best bagels, worst service. I think this store has been without competent management since they opened.  I usually avoid the place. But today I decided to give it a try. If I'm gonna indulge, an everything bagel with nova and chive cream cheese is my first choice. I'm at the order spot... no line, awesome. I place my order... Sorry we are out of everything bagels. I nearly loose my mind. It's 8:30 in the morning. No everything bagels.  With steam coming out of my ears, in the nicest tone I can muster. I place an alternate bagel order. UGH... It's delicious and delivered promptly as ordered. I was scared because the customer before me got someone else's order.  The passion tea was great too. I just wish these guys cared about their brand and reputation. This could be the \"it\" spot. Oh well :-("}
{"text":"Being from the east coast I am very particular about certain foods and bagels are one of them. I had stopped here a week ago and got a plain bagel with butter and I thought it was acceptable. So today I was nearby and decided to give them another try. I ordered a toasted everything bagel with butter and a medium coffee. I paid and they gave me my cup. I figured by the time I made my coffee the bagel would be done. Nope not even close. The people that came in after us got their order but we were still waiting. More then 10 minutes after ordering our bagels finally showed up. First of all my bagel only had butter on one half. Really? I had to go back up and get butter because who wants to eat a dry toasted bagel. Second my bagel was cold. It should had just been just toasted and still hot or at least warm. The butter didn't even melt. Major disappointment."}
{"text":"I've grabbed coffee and a bagel here before, but never tried their sandwiches.  Well holy good for me (I hope) sandwichness!  I had the roasted veggie on wheat, and yeah, it's got veggie schmear, and something that looked like cheese, but everything else was either veggie or hummus, and those are good for me, right?  Sure tasted good anyway.
Yum!!  Also, open til 8pm every day?!  Hallelujah!  I can actually grab something in this dead ass neighborhood on the weekends!  Plenty of other snacks to purchase and bring up to your room too - drinks, fruit, chips, and cookies."}
{"text":"I give them 5 stars based on how amazingly efficient and friendly the staff are even when it is really busy. The staff always seem to be working hard. The bagels are good, the breakfast are okay, I mean you don't go here for gourmet breakfasts. But overall the staff make the place."}
{"text":"6 stars!!! This Einstein's is amazing! The staff is friendly and prompt. I have visited the other locations in the surrounding area and the service and food fall short of the bar set by 59th and Tbird location. I have to attribute the quality found at this location to the owner. He is a beast! It's easy to see that the man takes pride in his establishment and cares about the customers. You rock man! I will continue to frequent this location."}
{"text":"Coming from NJ where the bagel is a source of pride and excellence, I was skeptical about coming here for breakfast. I ordered an egg sandwich with bacon and cheddar on an Asiago bagel. The bagel was soft but lacked the crusty outside. It had the right amount of flavor, although no SPK offered. It's not the worst I've had but if you're from NY or NJ think DD bagels, not Times Square bagels. Overall a decent meal for $4.99."}
{"text":"Before we get started on this review I need to set the precedent as to where I personally stand on donuts's low fat just as sexy cousin; bagels. I wouldn't be able to rate an establishment that supplies bagels any less than three stars unless they gutted the dough out of the bagels, making them no longer bagels. That being said this review is dedicated to the salsa manager at Einsteins. 

I have ordered the Santa Fe three times. That is one more than twice and one less than four and EVERYTIME I say \"let me get the Sante Fe with no salsa\". Apparently everytime I think I'm saying that, I'm actually saying \"let me get the Sante Fe with no salsa, but if you can't do no salsa I'll take a free pastry instead.\" I want the salsa manager to know that they play a pivotal role at Einsteins but they don't always have to be in on every play. Even Tom Brady has to hand the ball off every now and then. I want it to be clear I'm not writing this review for any more free pastries or other items that middle aged housewives with pink slippers expect when their orders are messed up. All I am asking is for a few employees to go into the restroom collectively as a team as I arrive, to ensure that no single employee's head is located more than five inches inside of their anus. This way I can enjoy your phenomenal food with a slight adjustment and you can enjoy employment. I look forward to our future endeavors together."}

{"text":"We have been at this Einstein a few times always hoping to get a better experience. It's always the same, young inexperienced, untrained, unmotivated staff.  It's always dirty, orders are usually incorrect,  coffee is usually out even sometimes the bagels aren't right, like they didn't raise properly. Management is probably the worst I've ever seen.  The owner of this place needs to take control quickly or lose this business."}
{"text":"I see reviews here are low... did I have a good experience because I was starving??  Hm... Well I waited in a fairly long line to get my order in at this Einsteins, but my order of a buffalo chicken bagel came out quite quickly and I devoured it.  I even debated ordering another one but dammit I am a tiny girl and I don't want that judgement!  Along with my bagel I ordered and iced tea.  I can't complain about my tea either and as my boyfriend says I love to complain.  The service was quick once I put that order in!  Oh, my boyfriend's bagel I did ask for toasted and they forgot.  I was going to give four-stars but I guess that merits three-stars."}
{"text":"I go here for primarily one thing - turkey sausage and cheddar bagel sammy. I crave that thing. It always satisfies. I wish more places would offer a turkey patty for their breakfast sandwiches. Also not sure if it's a seasonal thing, but the pumpkin muffin with the cream cheese frosting is heaven. I frequently pick up the bucket o' bagels for the office, and you get two cream cheeses (shmears) with each bucket. I love all the flavored cream cheeses (especially the strawberry and the garden veggie) and most of them are reduced fat, but they still manage to taste great. Bonus that Einstein has all their nutrition info on their site, I wish more companies would do so."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been to this location....it was always empty most of the time with slow & poor service & never enough bagels.  Stopped in today & it was so crowded, but in spite of that, they were amazing...orders taken fast, smooth checkout, orders coming up fast & brought to the table...all staff very courteous & friendly.  I was impressed!  Either things have changed or they perform better when they are busy.  It was good to see since I think of this as my neighborhood bagel place & I may actually use it more often now!"}
{"text":"Love this location, however, on a recent visit find that their bagels are now much smaller compared to other Einstein's locations. I actually do like the smaller size & hoping that means less calories, however, they should not be charging the same price for a dozen as they do for the larger size that their other locations have. Maybe it was just a fluke on this particular visit, but the bagels were much smaller, which we didn't notice until we got home."}
{"text":"i have been back a couple times in the last 2 months. i go early mornings, like 530am.  there has been a HUGE improvement.  the man working is super nice, and the younger guy who makes the bagels has been on point.  my sandwiches have been constructed perfectly and he is super fast.  Im very happy with the improvement.  hope it stays this way."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Been there multiple times, have waited and never been helped , eventually just walked.. people talking in the back not even caring that I was waiting. They have messed up my order before too. Absolutely terrible! Deserves 0 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"I have one word for this bagel place, rude! Lord help me baby jesus. I had to look around and make sure I didn't have a camera on me. I could only think that this cannot be serious but oh it was. I mean they look at you and I guess your suppose to just say your order. No may I help you? Nothing, I didn't know if she was having a seizure or a eye problem but either way i went ahead and stated my order which was a turkey sausage bagel on a regular thin wheat with cream cheese. She gave me the total, swiped my card and told me to stand \" ova there.\" The only guy working since his counterparts only wanted to talk to each other quickly called numbers and place them on the side. This left it open for any and everyone to come and pick up your stuff since they forgot their number ewww. I was not impressed and for that reason I will not be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in here yesterday for some bagel action. 

The guy taking our orders should not have been taking orders. not only did the hubs and I both have to repeat our very simple orders several times, he then told us we couldn't order drinks with him but at the register, which we always place our drink orders with the order taker... He seemed very overwhlemed.

Our drinks took forever. They were busy but the cashier is the drink maker as well apparently. We had to wait for a good 10 minutes for her to make our drinks. Meanwhile we see a manager just walking around, jump on drinks dude! 

When we got home we found our order messed up and none of the bagels were toasted like we had asked :( wah wah. Total bum out."}
{"text":"Hrmmm im honestly surprised at the lack of 5 star reviews for this location. 
I have been stopping in here for 5 or so years and have never had one bad experience. 

I stopped in on Wednesday, got a bagel with schmear and a large hot chia tea latte. 

My complaints are that the drinks come WAY SUPER HOT and the bagels always come with so much cream cheese that I have to scrap some off. Seriously, and those aren't bad complaints, im just picky. 

The service is always outstanding and fast! I never have to wait more then 3 minutes to get my hot drink and bagel in my hand. 
Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Quick service, decent and predictable food. Coffee is only so-so for me - prefer Dunkin Donuts coffee! But Einstein's Santa Fe on a green chile bagel keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"They have a girl with crazy long blond hair working. She had it in a ponytail but it was still dusting the prep counter and dusting everything everyone made with every turn she made. It was so gross. I went again yesterday and a different girl cut our 13 bagel wrong, she shrugged her shoulders and threw it away without replacing. You are supposed to get 13 in their dozen. I'll still eat there but just know there staff is very young and don't give a shit."}
{"text":"I swear something always goes wrong and every time I go back I hope for the best but I just can't anymore at this location. Soo I agree with others that this location is kinda dirty, even if it's a slow day. And I've been coming here for quite some time now and they can never remember me, and I kinda stick out  And idk if drinks are made different at different locations, but today they made me make my own iced coffee? Like what is that?! 3/4$ down the drain cause it tasted gawd awful when I tried to make it myself so I gave up and trashed it. And they never have creamers. If you ask, it takes them a long time, and not everyone has a lot of time when they are just there for coffee. But on the plus side. The food is great! Always love it. But you have to go kinda early if you want specifics cause they run out fast. So at least the food is yummy. Anyways I probably won't return to this location for quiet sometime, I love the other locations I've been to tho."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Vegas for the past 6 years at least 3-4x a year...we've tried a variety of on the strip and off the strip places to eat. We've learned that eating a good breakfast gets you through the long Vegas days. 

We tried Einstein Bagels for the first time twice during this past weekend and I am really impressed with the quality of bagels and the creative sandwiches they have. 

When we got there we were the second people in line and before I had made the order, the number of people in line was almost to the door, I would estimate at least 10 people in line. However, the line moved quickly and by the time I had paid and got my bagel sandwich, the line had dispersed. 

We tried the Chorizo Sunrise and the Smoked Salmon bagel sandwiches. They were both good but the Chorizo Sunrise was exceptional! The first time we tried it, the green chile bagel was still available, the second time we had it, they had run out of the green chile and we had it on a jalapeño bagel. It was spicy, tasty, and freshly made. They make the eggs while you wait and you know it's fresh because you can watch them. 

On Mondays, you can get a dozen for only $7...this place has a steady flow of patrons and they're not slow. The staff was helpful when I asked about the ingredients in one of their speciality bagels and looked it up for me. 

The reason I didn't give them 5 stars is the store needed the tables to be wiped down and the drink area needed some items to be refilled. Think they should pay attention to these two areas. However, this doesn't take away from the quality of the food and the friendly staff. I think this will be our breakfast spot when we come back in a few months."}
{"text":"Awful!!! Why am I waiting 20 minutes for a bagel! Everyone should cross the 101 and got to Big City Bagels!! They have friendly, FAST service. Support local business owners! Einstein's made me wait 20 minutes and then they gave me the wrong bagel!!! I blame the owner!!!!"}
{"text":"Got a big order for a group, ordered it at 8am. They said they wouldn't be ready until 1pm, but called us at 11:30 and told us to come to pick up. Not a great judge of time, apparently, but thats fine.

On the website, my Lox + Cream cheese should have had sprouts, cream cheese, tomatos, cucumbers, capers and a pickle, but my sandwich was missing the sprouts, the cucumbers, and the pickle. This made me sad, because I love pickles.

So, not sure what's going on here, but this was the case for all of the lox orders -- if you are going to provide a description on the website for what we can order, please abide by it. Otherwise, the sandwich was tasty and the service was fast because they were empty when we got there."}
{"text":"I love Einstein Bros Bagels!!!  The staff is very friendly and quick.  The bagels yummy.  Love the egg sandwiches.   The only problem is that is the smallest Einstein in the valley.  Seriously there is a huge shopping center in the same parking lot with empty store fronts.  Corporate needs to move them!!!"}
{"text":"Einstein brothers have really good bagels. I purchased a green pepper bagel which can be warmed up upon request and can come with cream cheese too. It tastes very good and it is spicy. It goes very well with coffee that they also serve. This bagel place is something to check out definitely when you are in Las Vegas and want to have breakfast in no time. In fact, Einstein Bros is the concept that's very trendy."}
{"text":"How hard is it to make a bagel toasted with avocado. Apparently very hard. Also I needed a microscope to see the avocado. Never again."}
{"text":"Please for the love of God, don't microwave eggs.

If not for that, this review would be a 3 or 3.5 stars, but seriously, eggs don't like microwavization. Just ruined the whole panini egg sandwich for me.

The coffee was pretty good. They had a selection of 4 going from light to dark which is nice. Lots of places have you choosing between a full city and a french which is frustrating.

Service was very friendly, but a tad slow for the number of people that were working there. I think they were focused on a lot of large pickup orders, but when you sell bagels by the barrel, you should expect that.

Saw some people picking up said bagel barrels, they mentioned how their office would cheer upon their arrival and heap laurels and praise on their shoulders. They boasted that their upcoming performance review was assuredly positive with such accolades. I smiled at them and wished them the best in their fantasy worlds. 

Scottsdale methinks is full of fantasy in this desert oasis."}
{"text":"I have had issues at this shop over the years but last few times I have been here it has been awesome.  I talked to a manager who said he had just been transferred to this location and he obviously does a great job because he seems to have fixed a lot of this stores issues. It's cleaner.  They make the food properly.  And the customer service has been much improved. So if the new manager reads this.  Thanks bro."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for a late breakfast this morning and were set on having some quality bagels and drinks.  Once we arrived, we were shocked that the line to order was about 20 people deep.  This didn't deter us as it seemed like the employees were working quickly enough and orders came out pretty fast.  Surprisingly, the place was filled with high schoolers, even though it was 10 am on a Tuesday (?).  The line was quick, maybe about 10 minutes.  

I have never been to an Einsteins before and was unfamiliar with ordering, but apparently you put in an order first and then there is someone to pay about 10 feet away.  The girl that took my order was extremely rude to me about moving forward to pay and when I checked my order, which of course she had messed up.  I ordered a regular sized chai and she charged me for a medium (more money) and didn't give me the bagel special that came with the drink and thus I had to pay about 3.50 for a bagel and creme cheese, wow... $$.  She had rushed me through the line and her attitude was not the greatest, not okay.  

The man at the cashier made up for her rudeness and was so pleasant that I didn't complain or change my order.  My order was placed and came out directly after I paid and I had a pretzel bagel with reg creme cheese (yumm, tasted like a delicious pretzel!).  But the drink, and iced chai; OMG soo sugarrry I almost went into a diabetic coma after having two sips.  Ugh, I poured it out and got green tea instead which was pretty delicious, so I was good to go after that loll!

Overall, I like Einsteins; but not such a fan of this location now and I think you have to try it out a few times before you know what you like!


PS~  random story; there was a woman in front of me that stuck her HAND under the soda machine and got a HANDFUL of ice... Um, icky blech, not very sanitary..."}
{"text":"I keep hoping this place will improve but alas NO. The employees are either completely untrained or just not the brightest. Just ordered a frozen Mocha which I should know better than to think a bagel shop knows anything about coffee. But, it took the poor girl 10 minutes to read the directions posted  on the wall then proceeded to have a fight with the whipped cream dispenser.  She never did win that fight. Ten as she was handing me my mess of a drink she spilled it. She said she would clean it up. Oh good..how about making me a new drink?  Now I have to go to work so just forget it and my business after 12 years. Ugh!!!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE Einstein's bagels! So soft and fluffy - both the bagels and their schmear! My favorite bagel would be their jalapeño bagel with garden veggie cream cheese and it will NOT disappoint. you can also get a tub of their jalapeño cream cheese but you just have to ask for it and they'll put it into a tub for you."}
{"text":"I wasn't too fond of this Einstein Bro's bagels.  Their bagels are your standard bagels, but the last time I was there, I ordered coffee in addition to their bagel sandwich.

When I went to the coffee station to get some, most of them were out.  There was one that wasn't, so I got some of that.  When I drank it, it was lukewarm.  Mind you, this was early in the morning, so the coffee could not have been sitting out for long.

I asked the workers if they would be making more coffee, and they told me they weren't.  I told them that the coffee they had was lukewarm and they didn't seem understand what I was saying.

After I stuck my finger in my coffee too show them that it wasn't hot, they said the coffee machine might not be working.

So there was NO coffee for the whole store.  What made this unacceptable was that I sat near the register, so I could see that they were still selling coffee to people, even when they knew all their machines were broken.  Why would they do that?

Everyone who went up to the coffee station left empty handed like I did."}
{"text":"This location closed early today. Online hours state 5pm. Hours on the door state 5pm yet the light were off and doors locked with nobody inside before 5pm!"}
{"text":"Fantastic employees at this location! I was running late this morning, but needed to bring bagels for a 9am meeting. They put together an assorted box for me, made recommendations for cream cheeses, and sliced the bagels. I was in and out in 5-6 minutes. 

Excellent customer service, I will be sure to come to this location for my bagels in the future!"}
{"text":"This had been my go to place for bagels for some time now. They have never disappointed me. The staff is always friendly and their coffee is really good too. My favorite is their vanilla hazelnut coffee. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"There is something wrong with the customer service at this location, before my order was being taken the mother and her child ordering wanted a specialty item which Rose (cashier) was not sure if the item was still continued. Instead of politely excusing herself to ask management if the item was still on the menu she asked the manager who was stalking the drinks if the item can still be made. Rose continued to talk as if there were no customers around her \" well one manager says this and one says that and i don't even know if we can make the BBQ that they want\"  
As I was placing my order I asked if there were any bananas and her face looked as if I was asking way to much for her to look for them. I simply changed my order and went up to pay for at the front. It just so happened as I was walking up that a new manager had brought bananas and I politely asked if I could quickly change my order back to what I had wanted in the beginning. Now this is where it starts rolling down hill.. 
Rose starts helping the line and she is taking the customers payment.. Not only did she seem unsatisfied from taking our orders and having a poor attitude and kicking things around on the floor  in the kitchen, but she even COMPLAINED to her customer how ANNOYED She was with \"certain\" customers and work stresses.  I was right next to her as she said this. As soon as that customer left her face changed and asked  me what was wrong with my bagel. With a simple response I just wanted my original breakfast. 
I was not satisfied with my meal at all 
I was charged an extra bagel and the team just looked disoriented. My advice, don't go to work with a bad attitude because your bad energy will ruin customers meals"}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday for brunch.  There was a choice of 3 bagels.  We immediately left."}
{"text":"I am giving it FOUR based on AZ bagels, not bagels in general. Us East coasters know a good bagel. These are \"good for AZ bagels\". They're veggie spread is good, bagels are pretty decent. A handy place to get a box of coffee and a box of bagels to show your coworkers you like them chubby. Nice outside seating that is dog-friendly."}
{"text":"Arrived Sunday morning. Place was empty.
Three people working.
They seemed unhappy to be there. No \" thank you \" from the guy after I paid for my order.

Just a place you don't want to stay st or come back to.

The ONLY half way nice person there was the girl."}
{"text":"The food is fine - it's bagels for crying out loud! The problem here is two-fold: 1) the layout of the place is bad, causing you to queue in the dining area and then wait for your food while you're in the way of customers coming in, going out or getting beverages; 2) as others state - the service is horrible!

Convenient but poor service."}
{"text":"Green Chile Bagels are excellent.  Either with the breakfast sandwich or the open faced turkey and cheddar it doesn't matter it is delicious.  Be weary of one thing.  I didn't see a price on the orange juice, but when they rang me up it was like 4 bucks.  Other than that this place is always great  for a quick fix."}
{"text":"Without a doubt this is the absolute worst Einstein's I have ever been to!  I get that Saturday mornings are busy but 45 minute wait to get 2 bagels with cream cheese is absurd!  Most of the choices weren't available but my daughter and I were able to get our favs, spinach florentine and chocolate chip.  

During our 45 min wait (I'm not exaggerating) we witnessed at least 6 orders get returned because they were wrong.  Several people asking the status ir complaining and the workers were just rude to them and yelled saying they didn't know.  The manager was a complete prick too and didn't care.  The thing that annoyed me is they weren't short staffed, they had at least 6 people working the front (bagels, drinks, register, etc).

The absolute worst part was the lack of sanitation.  I watched the manager empty the garbage and lift the dripping bag over the counter where they make bagels then touch food... all without washing his hands!  Plus the girl working the register and making smoothies was touching money and the register and then touching bananas for the smoothies without washing her hands.  Also, they don't wash the blender cups, they just rinse them.  Gross!

Will never ever be back to this location."}
{"text":"Bad service and poor management.Dorothy believe name of assistant manager and she just talking down to customers. Quality good for food but the service and experience just makes it not a pleasant experience. Would not recommend this place if this lady is here."}
{"text":"This is a popular location (very busy on weekend mornings) that we've been to several times. We've come for breakfast a few times. Hubby has also visited, during the week, for just the bagels as there was a special with the bakers dozen (13) on mondays recently. If you have the coupons from the weekly circulars (BOGO, or a baker's dozen with schmears- the veggie schmear is delish!), it's also another incentive to come here. Don't forget to enter your telephone number to get additional member deals. 

There are so many different bagels- cheese, everything, sesame, pretzel, cranberry, potato, whole grain, etc., to choose from, although the gourmet bagels are not included with the specials. If there is something that you like that is very popular, there is a chance that it will be gone, unless you get there early. 

The breakfast sandwiches (select from one egg or two egg) are so yummy (I think that the farmhouse- cage free eggs, thick-cut bacon, smoked ham, cheddar cheese, w/ country pepper schmear, is our favorite, on a hash brown bagel). Hubby remembers, years ago, when there were only a couple of selections for breakfast, but now the menu is pretty big- 13 choices.  

There are sample cups for their coffee, located along the left side of the restaurant. The counter is the very back end of the restaurant (pay at the end of the counter). Ample seating inside, and it's clean, but if it's crowded, you might consider taking it to-go. The employees are nice and busy, but they keep the line going, it's pretty fast. Most locations close at 3 pm (that aren't in the tourist areas), but this one closes at 4 pm (except sundays, closes at 3 pm)."}
{"text":"Not bad. The service felt rushed and insincere but can't judge a person/restaurant based off one time. Bagels could've been prepared with more care. Overall, 3 stars is accurate."}
{"text":"Zea was completely without personality or hospitality. We ordered at 11:32am after waiting in line for a minimum of 10 minutes. Our food came
out within 10 minutes, though wrong the kitchen staff made every effort to correct it. Zea however kept telling us our drinks were being made but we could clearly see the drink station and no one was manning it. We asked several times and were met with a cold response and snippy reception. After 15 minutes we finally received our coffees. She was not only unpresentable in appearance for food service (dirty hair and unkept dirty clothing) but she was also unfit for service with her lack of customer service skills. How unfortunate."}
{"text":"Consistently awful service. Everyone working looks completely miserable, no one smiles, no one seems to know what's going on. The manager looks defeated and over it. Makes me wonder if there's trouble with the company in general."}
{"text":"The bagels are really fresh here. I got the 6 cheese bagel toasted with cream cheese. So good! The coffee is really good here too. Staff is very friendly. Will come back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Fabulous fresh breakfast!! Great price and friendly staff :) 
The hazelnut coffee is a must! Don't forget to get your mustache sleeve for your hot coffee  they have so many great options for everything :)"}
{"text":"Major improvements at this location in the last few weeks. They started using the order counter again, tables are always clean, orders are fast now and staff has really stepped up their game to make it an enjoyable location again. Since the changes I have been back to visiting the location at least 3 or 4 times a week again. thank you!!"}
{"text":"They get through a line of six or more customers in a couple minutes, prepare your order while you pay and wait.  In about five minutes they have your order packaged, call your name and then BRING it to you.  If you are eating your food here they bring it to your table.  
.  
I like this location, great service and friendly staff every time."}
{"text":"Slower every time I come.  Today order was done wrong.  It is not busy so why must we wait for service (to order and to pay) and then receive order half right.
We hit another location in the area and always get better service so we decided that's just where we'll take our business."}
{"text":"In the past we would go here almost every weekend.  But lately the food seems more processed and less fresh and the prices keep going up.  No a good value and my family does not really enjoy the food anymore.  The eggs are good example.  They don't taste good or even resemble eggs, but are easy to store and cook for the workers.   I am sure the company is making more profit now though."}
{"text":"Below average experience. First, the physical layout of the store is not suited for convenient in and out, unless there are very few patrons. There is only one door and you have to wade across the interior tables and coffee bar to get to the ordering line. On a crowded morning it is a mess. I ordered the Nova Lox Bagel and was very disappointed. Very little salmon and green tomatoes. About $3 worth of sandwich for almost $7, not a good value. I like the basic texture and taste of the bagels, hence two stars. This location suffers the affliction of most chains,  it lacks quality control, on site adult supervision and value.  Having said that, the place was crowded with people, so I guess there are no reasonable alternatives close by."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to this place I get reminded why I dislike it as much as I do...They always seem so disorganized ordering here paying over there, like if they would eve be able to have your food by the time you pay...but today I heard it loud and clear  \"Get Out\". I recently stop eating Meat and ordered a  bagel with no meat...only to almost bite onto a bacon bagel...not what I order...Thank you...I promise not to forget this time and keep wondering in there like a village idiot..."}
{"text":"At this location to them toasted actually means warmed up. Even if you ask them to toast it so it shows its toasted they won't do it. Just go to Starbucks or somewhere else where they know how to toast a bagel. It's kinda sad since that is all they do is bagels and they can't even do it right."}
{"text":"When this establishment first opened we loved going here on a Sunday morning. So, I was really looking forward to a bagel and coffee here during my stay at the Hyatt. So sad though. We loved the white chocolate mocha coffee and the hot chai latte but the bacon egg and cheese bagels were horrible. Darn! We were so disappointed . The staff were friendly and it was pretty quick and the drinks were good so I gave them 3 stars. Maybe better next time."}
{"text":"Einstein has fast service. They are often looking for ways of expanding their menu and changing things up. They try to stay up with health trends like bringing in the avocado toast. They offer smoothies and juices in addition to coffee. I like the people there. But I have 3 major issues. The first is the biggest so I will start with it. How dare you charge 10 cents extra for people to make their bagel thin. You lose approximately 1/3 of the bagel which should make it cheaper but oh no, you have the audacity to charge more for it. I'm ill over this because more than anything it punishes people for trying to save a few calories and in their minds maybe be a little healthier. That is a low blow and I for one am livid about it. That practice must change immediately. 2) you charge well over $2 for a fountain drink which is a mockery. Basically you're charging a fortune for a damn cup and that is just not ok. 3) the pumpkin cookie you got rid of that used to come in the fall is just about the best tasting cookie out there and I'm sad that you got rid of it. Thankfully Walmart has a decent substitute that is far cheaper. Hate to harp on the money thing but you guys went way too far charging me more for less food. WRONG."}
{"text":"Rudest Employees EVER!

Ok, so I get it kid, your not happy that you are working at Einsteins but frankly that's not my problem. I have never been so blatantly disrespected by employees EVER! Avoid this location at all costs. 

So I came in this morning following a doctors apt, I was hungry and I knew I wouldn't have time for lunch so I just wanted to pop in and grab a couple of bagels to bring to the office. Some how two bagels with cream cheese on the side take 25 minutes to make, and apparently they come with a side of getting yelled and belittled by an employee for asking if my order had been called. The kid couldn't even be bothered to look at the screen and see if something had happened to my order (after saying I didn't see my name up there another employee looked and couldn't find my order)... I saw the same kid talk back to other customers. 

So after 30 minutes, I finally got my bagel and was on my way into my office.

Avoid this cluster of a Einstein Brothers Bagels at all costs."}
{"text":"Bagels and coffee, it's my thing! But good service is super important to me and when I get exceptional service I frankly want to tell everyone I know! Einstein's of course has decent bagels, breakfast sandwiches etc... This particular location is even adjacent to a Starbucks (like I said, coffee and bagels.... it's my thing)! But what really has me stoked is the service here, Manager Tom really made my day with his dashing personality! It's always nice when employees actually seem like they don't mind working or gasp! even possibly enjoy their job! 
So thanks Tom for making my Einstein Bros Bagel trip a memorable experience!"}
{"text":"\"Bagel Dog\"  promotion today was awesome and Yummy, too !
Gilbert location is our favorite."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant and friendly staff at this location. Good place to stop for a morning bagel and coffee."}
{"text":"The menu is really good for a chain restaurant. The bagels are fresh, the choices of sandwiches is very good and the coffee is the best in town. If you bring your own travel mug, it's only a buck. Staff is friendly however sometimes they get confused about menu items and that leads to mistakes."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place. The food is delicious, the place is well kept, the workers are are very friendly. One of the employees by the name of Rudy was very nice. He made sure our order was made in a timely manner and came to my table after receiving my order to make sure that my food was good. I love love love their shmearfulls they are a ball of goodness. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Quick friendly service. Good breakfast sandwiches, and also lunch.
You can eat outside-but watch out for the birds-a girl left her wrapped sandwich on a table, and a lttle tweeter got right in the plastic basket and proceeded to help itself to breakfast!! Yes, we did let her know."}
{"text":"Love love love Einstein bagels. I always order the Turkey bacon Alvacado. I've tried their pizza bagel and liked that too. The Cheyenne location however has the best service! They are fast and always get my order right. Five stars ***** for sure!"}
{"text":"I have the hardest time rating and reviewing chain restaurants. I mean I don't come here because of the world renowned bagels. I come here because... \"I am hungry and wanted a bagel so this place will do\". 

What makes or breaks a chain location for me is if they have good service and if the food is consistent. Well this Einstein is not consistent! Too many times I have had to wait 20 minutes for 2 toasted bagels! And other times I get home to a bagel with barely any cream cheese on it. I shouldn't have to go into my own fridge to apply cream cheese to a bagel that should already have cream cheese on it. 

I wish they would nail down the consistency part here, it would really make my bagel craving mornings a wee bit better."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the cleanliness of this location.  Needed to have a good scrub and mop.  Visible debris and spills on counters, napkin dispensers and floors that looked like it had been there a while. Couldn't get the images out of my head, and started questioning the safety of my food.  Ended up tossing it!"}
{"text":"3 people working man was in front of bagels I ask if he's in line he said yes! So I spoke up and ask u can't ignore Acknowledge your customers! He said he's been waiting a long time. Me that I am I spoke up! Debra was rude and I ordered a strawberry banana smoothie and she didn't even put bananas in it! I'm from California and ever since I moved to Las Vegas customer service sucks out here. Never would come back to this one...."}
{"text":"My 11yo son says this is the king of all bagel places.  He should know bagels are 75% of his diet"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for getting bagels for meetings in the morning. They are fast and ready for a large volume of customers. Everyone is very friendly and the prices are reasonable. It's quick to get to off of the 51."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for some years now, however, today it seems to have sunken to an all time low. Looks like they have more people working there but the service got worse. How do you do that? I noticed the tables weren't being bussed as soon as I walked in there and I noticed that the person bussing them was doing a real crappy job. To top my whole experience off I found a black hair in my potato salad. Gotta find a new breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I have a total love-hate relationship with Einstein's.  

Love: fresh bagels, good cream cheese, and solid bagel sandwich offerings.
Hate: the staff that works here.  

Last time I came in I ordered my standard Santa Fe Turkey Breakfast sandwiches to go.  The girl at the counter argued with me with the type of bagel it was to go on (1. I thought you always had a choice in bagel, and 2. I'm pretty sure I've ordered this sandwich more times than I care to count; I know what's what).  She said that it was supposed to be on an Everything Bagel, and I wanted it on an Asiago (the bagel it's slated to go on).  She then had the gall to ask if I even knew what I was ordering.  I politely smiled, and said I know what I'm asking for so please give me my order as I have asked for it.  She checked me out, I took my sandwiches home, and lo and behold my sandwiches were on an Everything bagel; not the Asiago like I've asked.  Whammy.

This is just an isolated incident from the staff here.  I think every time I come something goes awry with the staff.  I keep coming back because the breakfast is quick and tasty, however someone needs to start training the employees on proper customer service.

4 stars for the food; 1 star for the service."}

{"text":"This Einstein Brothers is in the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Phoenix, which is across from the convention center.

I used to like to go to the North Scottsdale Einstein's up there, especially on the weekends. 

For those of you who know Noah's Bagels, Einstein's is something like that. They have usually about 16 or 20 different flavored bagels, and serve sandiches, salads, coffees and other beverages. 

They make a good Lox and Bagels, with your choice of bagel. They toast it for you, give you cream cheese and capers, red onions, and slices of tomatoes. I love this from Einsteins. I like it on the Asiago cheese flavored bagels. 

They also have their own ice tea blend, which they call \"Spontenai Tea. It only comes in one size, has a refreshing tea flavor mixed with fruit flavors and ginger. 

They can make most of the specialty coffee drinks that  you find at that place with the little brown mermaid with no bra on. 

Refreshing! (The tea, not the the topless mermaid! That is somehow strangely semi-erotic. But it is all in the mind's eye, not reality!)

Service was good and friendly here, too."}
{"text":"Came here with 10 high school students before a leadership development event. They got us through and fed in ten minutes! Staff was friendly and accommodating. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I've traveled all around the world and I've never been to a coffee bagel shop quite like this one. I absolutely love Peter. He's awake at the crack of dawn (they open at 5am, but the employees arrive long before that time). He always has a smile on his face and he treats every customer as if they were his friend. He's truly one of a kind and an asset to Einstein Bagel Co. 

Keep shining Peter!!!"}
{"text":"Was driving down the street and saw the Einstein sign as I was almost about to pass it.  Luckily for me there were no other cars in my way and I veered across two lanes of traffic to make it into the parking lot.  The place was so deserted out front that I actually had to check Yelp to see if they were open, confirmed they were then made my way inside.  The place was completely empty so I made my way right to the front.  However once I got up to the counter there was no one there to help me.  Now, I'm not 100% sure a bell went off when I walked in but I'm pretty sure it did, you know, to alert the people in the back when someone walks in in just this kind of example.  I could hear a group of people talking and laughing in the back but no one was coming out to check on the front.  I also noticed a camera pointing at the counter, not sure if that's for management to watch the staff or for the staff to watch for customers but either way it wasn't helping me get a bagel any faster.

After a few minutes a girl finally walked out to help me and didn't act very apologetic about the lack of service.  Once she took my order another girl went through the process of actually toasting and preparing my bagel and she was quick and polite.  The bagel itself was as good as I knew it would be and I'll go back to other locations but the service I received at this particular one will definitely prevent me from returning here."}
{"text":"It took 27 minutes to get a sandwich. Sunday at 11:00
 I would not recommend at peak hours unless you are OK with a wait."}
{"text":"Hot coffee and emergency food.

They even smiled at all the grumpy people, 
which might have included me."}
{"text":"Bagels are ok. Not the best I've had. But what bothers me about this Einsteins is that they charge more for the cream cheese on your bagel than the bagel itself. That's ludacris. Who does that? 

The creamer is always out so you have to ask. Even a guest I didn't know said something when he saw me shaking the container to see if anything was in it. 

I'm very disappointed in Einsteins."}
{"text":"They closed early when I walked up at 4:45 PM to employees outside the door couldn't even tell me that they were closed no respect worst customer service I've ever had I will understand if this company is not in business much longer"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and remembers their customers. The manager rocks and has great customer service skills. The bagels are always fresh."}
{"text":"The girl with messy blond hair blue eyes (with eyeliner like a raccoon) was super rude AND when i took a bite of my bagle i bit into paper. They left half of a paper on the cheese! First time here and I will NEVER go back horrible customer service"}
{"text":"This place is good for basic bagels, always has been, but beyond that it's just par (not sub-par, but par). Of course that's only MY opinion. For my breakfast needs, I'd rather find a better place with breakfast bagels that taste a bit more fresh and juicy. Maybe I just had a bad experience, but I still feel like I'd go here again. Who knows, I did go pretty early when they were still kind of getting everything ready."}
{"text":"This location specifically has one of the worst services ....... the cashier was rude he looked down at us the whole time and actually made us feel unwelcome.  I've never felt so out of place.... sorry but this was the worst experience ever"}
{"text":"Too bad other reviewers have been complaining about the very friendly service in the mornings because that is what I came on here to praise! Despite it being early, Becca and Chelsea made it a really great experience for me. Thank you to you both!"}
{"text":"I hadn't had Einsteins in a while so my husband and I stopped in there. The first time they were out of the bagel that I wanted. So I order something different. We waited about 25 minutes for our food. Nothing too bad but definitely not impressive. 

I really like there coffee so I went back. My second time I order my food then a bagel sandwich for my husband. Before I could finish my order the server cuts me off. Shouting at me when he does it, he quickly apologizes for shouting and tells me about how he is having a rough day.... Then I get to where I need to pay and there is no one there. One lady looks over at me and says someone will be right with me. Then she goes to where you order and starts asking him to switch with her. Made me feel like she didn't want to help me. So I get my food get home and my husbands sandwich was made wrong. We spent over $7.00 for his sandwich alone and to not have it right after being treated rudely is not a good business. I will not be returning. Which is really disappointing because I do like their food."}
{"text":"I like this Einsteins but you have to go in the morning if you want a good bagel selection. Today I got 6 bagels and a schmear. The bagels all seemed fresh and tasted good. They have a good rewards program and you don't even have to build up points to get deals.Today's deal I got was only 6 dollars. My only gripe is that sometimes the employees aren't that friendly. They often just seem like they're in a hurry, but that's not a bad thing either I guess."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Great baked bagels, nice selection of toppings, with caffeinated drink options to your liking. My latest visit greeted me with friendly employees and fresh bagels. I grabbed a bagel bucket (13 bagels + 2 smear tubs for $15) and an iced coffee. In and out in under 5 minutes so they don't mess around here. There's plenty of clean space inside to cop a squat and enjoy your breakfast. You'll likely find newspapers lying around to help pass the time. There's ample parking in the private lot in front of Einstein's. Oh, and there's a Coffee Bean right next door if you prefer their java. I saw a few tables out front, and this is the time of year to enjoy those spots in the morning (can I get a hallelujah for 60-degree weather)...

I mean, yeah it's a chain but they have great bagels. I love their garlic or asiago cheese. There are probably 20+ varieties with muffins, cookies, scones and other baked goods to enjoy as well. For lunch options you can build your own sandwich on a fresh bagel."}
{"text":"I'm afraid to admit- my wife and I visit this Einstein way too often. We're 100% dedicated drive-thru users, and stick to a usual regimen. Two toasted bagels (typically garlic, sesame, or everything) with two specialty coffees. My wife prefers their hot vanilla latte and I'm the iced caramel machiatto addict (asking for the caramel to be melted and mixed into the espresso to make for a smoother drink). It's a $15 tab and we spend it at least 2-3 times per week.

The drive thru is typically speedy, with nice service. Obviously weekend mornings are  a little busier than others but that's to be expected, right? The staff still gets you through quickly and with a smile. 

The breakfast sandwiches are a good alternative- and offer some calorie conscious eaters options (turkey sausage and no cheese anyone?)... if you are calorie counting stay away from the blueberry muffin bites. Just trust me on that one.

You're always apt to see folks with their pets camped out on the small patio space, so it's cool to see the pet-friendly space. Even though it's a typical breakfast chain, it's a great alternative to other fast food places like McD's or BK. The coffee is good, food is great, and staff friendly! 

And don't forget they offer lunch items- lunchmeat sandwiches served on a bagel of your choice. The taste options are practically endless. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been to EBB in AZ, CA, NV, and now TX. Unfortunately, this recent expedition was my worst. The employees were rude- seemed like they wanted to be any where else but there to help customers. I had to shout my order because the store's music was loud (at 6:45a mind you) so that was a little unnerving. 

The food was as it always is- great bagels with just the right amount of flavor and cream cheese. Lots of options to select from. Make sure to get your toasted, makes them seem fresher to me. Also many varieties of toppings to consider, from lox to cheese to butter to PB. Or you get it plain!

Wish there was an EBB closer to where I live (NE Fort Worth), guess I won't be coming here too often. And the crappy service didn't make me want to get there any quicker either. Boopa's Bagels it is for me!!!"}
{"text":"Went in for a simple plain bagel with cream cheese and the cashier had an awful attitude but I let it pass . Then I saw the guy that was preparing the bagels break eggs and with the gloves on moved the trash an closer to him, then continued breaking eggs and then he went to prepared the orders . This is called cross contamination! Money wasted! P.S. They are open again ."}
{"text":"Not sure why all of the bad reviews. Today is my 3rd or fourth time here and always clean and consistently nice people. Bagels are fresh and they make awesome coffee drinks too! Anthony/AJ was especially nice and has an overall great attitude! This is MY fave local bagel shop. Good up the good work!!"}
{"text":"I don't get all the bad reviews here. This is the closest bagel shop to my house, I've been about 5x. Same experience every time, they are always quick, good/friendly service and the manager is very nice and helpful. For a chain bagel store I think this is as good as it gets, no they aren't NY bagels, but we aren't in NY are we! I've got no qualms with this Einstein Bros!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Christian and Kory, they were very helpful and professional. Good size lunch bagel sandwiches, I recommend this location."}
{"text":"The tuna salad on the menu turned out to be a tuna sandwich but it was not bad at all and priced fairly at 8.99.  A little messy to eat because it is well stuffed with what tasted freshly prepared vegetables and plenty of tuna 

My friend had the same but was not too impressed but did agree that it is very messy to eat.

The options at southwest terminal are very few and this seemed most healthy"}
{"text":"Frequent visitor of this location. Usually a little bit of a line but manageable. They have a pretty good selection, not that I stray that much. 

Their coffee is pretty good, I like that I can refill it at my leisure. Like all Einsteins they put A LOT of cream cheese on the bagels, but its easy to spread off to your liking."}
{"text":"I saw the low yelp scores before I walked in and thought, \"c'mon, it's Einstein Bagels, give um a break how bad could it be\"?  They were right, ran out of plain, Sesame and everything bagels on a Saturday morning, need I say anymore?"}
{"text":"Disaster.  They were out of the key smears marketed.  Then, after waiting in a slow moving line (which only had about five people, but one must actually wait through two lines), they forgot our order and had to start over.  Fortunately, I had shoved the receipt in my pocket (which I normally wouldn't do) so I could prove that I paid, although I didn't have any way to prove whether or not the bagels had actually been received.  I spent over 30 minutes trying to buy 6 bagels and a tub of cream cheese.  My son ended up being 10 minutes late for a 30 minute piano lesson.

While standing in the ordering line then again in the paying line, then in the cluster waiting to get my bagels, I realized how \"jacked\" the Einstein ordering system is.  It took three different people to sell me six bagels, any one of which could screw up.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was fine until about a week ago. I received terrible customer service after not placing an order in advance. The woman behind the counter acted as though my failure to order in advance was a personal insult to her. I order bagels for my work and sometimes, I don't get enough advance notice to place an order beforehand. When I told her that, she still had major attitude. It was very unprofessional."}
{"text":"I tried the VegOut Sandwich.. but its too cheesy and with a lot of calories :) I should go back to subway. I wanted to taste the Hearty Veg Soup, but the place on 48th and Ray road did not have any vegetables remaining at lunch!"}
{"text":"I love Einstein's but this place was wayyy too dry. Their bagel's were very mediocre, and the pricing is ridiculous! Probably would not come here again- but again, it's quick solution if you needed something to nibble on."}
{"text":"Let me preface my review by saying I love (or used to love) Einstein bagels.  I've been to this location three times and it's just getting worse, to the point where I don't think I'll return.

Today, I ordered a bagel with cream cheese and a bfast sandwich, along with a fountain drink.  I waited about 15 minutes for my food.  Staff was mysteriously missing from the front and everyone appeared to be wearing baggy, dirty clothes.  At the register, things were dusty, there were gift cards with snowmen on them, spilled coffee, just a mess.  No better at the drink bar where I wondered if/when anyone had cleaned the soda machine, as it was filthy and the coke tasted weird.  Spilled milk everywhere.  Just disgusting.  I think as a result of the experience, the food, when I left, just did not taste good either.  I doubt I'll be headed back to this particular location.  Ever."}
{"text":"Friendly staff even so early in the morning, however the coffee is more like flavored water.  

Try the locks & capers for a surprisingly filling breakfast, otherwise bagels are generally lightly toasted (could probably ask them to turn it up if you want crispy).

Ambience bounces on the end of a diving board into a pool of dingy.

Free bagel with Yelp check-in, so give it a try to see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Food delicious and service is usually pretty good.The quality of my food depends on who makes it.I don't like when they put my toasted bagels together because the shmear stays somewhat cold and doesn't get as soft."}
{"text":"Lots of fresh bagels, nice employees, clean store. I had to smell these delicious bagels all the way to work! I'm eating a cranberry one now and it is the best!!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have been to an Einstein's.  I have always loved their food and their coffee.  I am a sucker for pumpkin season and was hearing non-stop ads on the radio every morning promoting their new pumpkin products.  I stopped in on a Sunday around 1030, ordered the pumpkin bagel and pumpkin shmear.  The girl who was taking our order was not friendly and seemed like she did not want to be there.  Not rude, but not really all there.  After waiting in line to pay, an employee came up to me and said they were out of the pumpkin bagels.  I'm pretty sure that they had been out of pumpkin bagels before I got there as their entire top shelf of bagels was empty (meaning they ran out of others as well).  It was annoying that I wasn't told this before I paid and disappointing that Einstein's is going to promote the heck out of their pumpkin lineup and then not make enough to last through the day or morning for that matter.  I ended up picking out a plain bagel, to find out they didn't even slice it for me.   They sliced the other bagel in the bag, though.  I have to say that the saving grace was that the bagel was fresh and delicious, as was the pumpkin shmear.  Seems like the management and service needs to get it together."}
{"text":"You always know you're going to get a good bagel at Einstein's however I am growing tired of then never have pretzel bagels yet have a bins full of chocolate chip and blueberry.  Come on Einstein's..."}
{"text":"After seeing the restroom I wanted to vomit the delicious bagels I had just eaten. It hadn't been cleaned in what looked like years. The floor, toilet, sink was FILTHY with dirt (literally a grey sink and toilet), pee, water spots, calcification. The base of the toilet was grey from built up dirt, dust, filth.  It was very clear that they never ever ever clean the restroom. Ever. I told the manager that the bathroom was filthy, even though I knew she knew it. She just walked away and said ok. I went back towards the bathroom a few min later w my phone to take a couple photos to show my husband but she stopped me, and was putting on some tiny clear gloves. I thought, \"it's going to take a lot more than that!\"  She went in and back out after a minute or so. It was the strangest thing.  Why even go in and fake like your going to clean it when it's obvious that you never have and don't plan to?  Such a nice restaurant chain with no regard for public health. I've even considered calling the health department, it was that bad... But then I'm just being a total jerk. Hopefully the owner reading a yelp review will get things taken care of. I'll delete it if they want to respond.  Like I said, I wanted to barf the food I just ate bc it was clear that if they care that little about sanitation, the kitchen, which customers don't see, could be so much worse."}
{"text":"My review is based off their lunch menu. The sandwiches are okay in terms of taste, but hardly worth the price. I paid $8 for a panini comprised mostly of bread. Oh, and I had to wait 15 minutes when the place wasn't even busy. To top it off, once I finally got my sandwich and proceeded to my car, the girl that put it together was out front of the store smoking - yuck. I've been here before for other menu items with similar experiences and will not be coming back. I'm sure there are better morning bagel places around...and I really wish I would of went to Sprouts for a better quality sandwich filled with meat and veggies for half the price!"}
{"text":"Worst Einstein Bros ever. 
I got an everything bagel with a smear of smoked salmon cream cheese. 
It was spread as thin as butter on toast. I'm talking about a 1/4 teaspoon at most. I could see the bagel through the cream cheese !
Don't be so god damn cheap."}
{"text":"It wasn't clean. The floor had food, trash, liquids, and debris all over it and the front door looked like it hadnt been wiped down in months, it was so gross. There were 7-8 people working but they all appeared to be disorganized. They were \"out\" of several bagel flavors... come to find out after placing my order most of the bagels that were missing from the case were against the wall on racks and just hadn't been refilled. The order taker was clueless. 

While I was placing my order, another worker kept interrupting myself and the young lady taking my order. 

I only went because I had a gift card. I would not go back."}
{"text":"A long line at an Einstein is to be expected on a Saturday morning.  But a more than 15 wait for two toasted bagels with smear is not.  That, by the way, was after a five minute wait just to order and pay.  I know that the biggest part of this issue is that a chain like Einstein has set ways of doing things, but it would've been nice to see some of the workers have a little more urgency to get food out.  It was so backed up that there was barely a place to stand and wait at 8:00am.  I don't even want to know what it may have looked like at 9:00 or 10:00."}
{"text":"My dislike of Einstein Bros Bagels is pretty obvious.  Just look at some of my reviews of other locations.  I only ate here because it was 7:30am, I was hungry, a bagel sounded good, and I had some time kill before an appointment just across the street.

Like any Einstein, the bagels are acceptable.  Nothing amazing.  Just good enough that I am willing to part ways with $3 for bagel and cream cheese without being angry.  That being said, it really felt like this location skimping on the cream cheese.  I'm also not a fan of the set up.  Not only do I hate waiting in line to order, then waiting in line to pay, then waiting for my food, but this location's toasters are in the middle of those lines.  When they call your name, you have to walk back to the middle where people are waiting to grab you bagel.  Couldn't someone take 3 seconds to walk toward the group of people waiting?

This location does have something going for it that I do appreciate; Friday Challah!  Great call by whomever was smart enough to realize that they're in a very jewish part of town.  I have no idea if it's any good.  I doubt I'm going to drive over to Einstein just to get Challah, but I appreciate that"}
{"text":"I stop by this location every now and then on my way to work on weekends. That pretty much means I'm too lazy to cook a good breakfast, but want something more than cereal. 

I've never had the major issues other people are yelping about. Perhaps things have improved since then. I find that If you stick to a bagel and cream cheese, all is well. But (and I find this the case with most Einsteins) if you try to order anything hot, you're about to get what tastes like an over priced frozen microwave meal."}
{"text":"Like most Einstein locations, I'm unimpressed with the way the business is run.  The bagels aren't  bad, but they're not worth the aggravation it takes to obtain one.  The line was crazy long on a Wednesday morning at 8:30am, there already was a severe shortage in options because several bagels and pastries were already sold out, and after ordering you continue to wait in line just to pay.

There are some pluses.  This location has plenty of seating (however, most of it is outside on a shared patio with Starbucks and a sandwich shop).  It's a short walk from the Camelback automile, which makes it one of the best places to grab something to eat if you're getting your car serviced around breakfast or lunchtime.  It's also open until 5pm which is actually pretty late for an Einstein.

Judging by the fact that I've reviewed three Einstein locations, and given all of them just two stars, I'm guess that most of the problems come down from the corporate level.  However, each location seems to always have a steady flow of customers, so why should they work to improve the massive flaws?"}
{"text":"\"So many shmears, so little time.\" Love coming to Einstein for a quick bite to eat. This location is nice. Seems like it's a bit busy in the morning. The quality of the bagels were good and coffee as well. They offer a variety of bagels, hard to choose just one! As a coffee lover, their brand is good. I love their Vanilla Hazelnut flavored coffee."}
{"text":"I love the bagels but hate coming here due to poor service. Management has stepped it up! This place is running very efficiently and smooth on a busy Sunday morning. Nicely done..."}
{"text":"Food is decent, staff is friendly, but they almost ALWAYS get our food order wrong:  we've gotten lox sandwiches without the lox, the wrong type bagel, hummus veggie sandwich without the hummus, etc. I suggest going to another Einstein location if it is close by."}
{"text":"Great tuna sandwich! Very generous filling of tuna along with lettuce, tomato and onion. Had it on a potato roll--delish!  It was so much better than bread. I like Einsteins coffee which is not harsh and strong like Starbucks.

Manager who made my sandwich was friendly and helpful. A good experience at Einsteins all around."}
{"text":"I've been to this store several times - in the past - and have tried the cheese, garlic, plain and combo bagels.  This location is packed in the mornings with regulars:  cops, locals, many of the people from my neightborhood, including a columnist from the Arizona Republic.   I don't like their bagels.  They're small, bland, and too dense.  My favorite bagels are Costco's cheese bagels.  Second runner up are Fry's cheese bagels."}
{"text":"With five people behind the counter - it doesn't look like anybody knows what's going on.  They ran out of plain bagels at 11:30 and someone next  to me complained about her sandwich being cold. Another guy ordered a sandwich on a plain bagel - they never told him they were out. I don't know what's going on here but quite a disorganized mess."}
{"text":"If you have been to an Einstein Bagels, you know the drill. Order at one counter, then pay at another, then pick up at a third. The service is good but nothing exceptional. 

This particular location feels a little run down, but nothing that is overly disconcerting.

My favorite part of Einstein Bagels is that I can get breakfast at lunch time. Breakfast is my absolute favorite meal of the day, but I never had time to pick up breakfast before work. (I am lucky if I remember to even eat breakfast.) At lunch time, Einstein still has its breakfast menu available and it is really good."}
{"text":"Great bagels, yummy coffee. The people are awesome. I come for breakfast at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Octavio, who I think is a manager at this location, is fast, courteous and runs everything from taking orders to being cashier.  He and this location are great!"}
{"text":"Was in today for a egg/bacon/cheese bagel sandwich and it literally took 22 seconds for the nice people behind the counter to prepare it & bag it up. And the egg was real-- from a chicken rather than a plastic tub! I was pleased/surprised and my first thought, though I haven't eaten there in at least a decade was, \"Suck it Ronald McDonald!\""}
{"text":"This is my home-base Einstein's..or is it Noah's Bagels?  Same thing really.  I was delighted to learn Phoenix has Noah's sister company, Einstein Bros Bagels, upon moving here.

My favorite is the 6 cheese bagel, but I'm branching out more and more and trying other flavors.

Minus one star for running out of my beloved 6 cheese from time to time and I sitll have a hard time paying $5 for a bagel, cream cheese (I refuse to use that awful 'S' word they use), and juice."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location.  It was located on W Flamingo Rd/near S Fort Apache Rd in Las Vegas.  We came in for National Bagel Day.  They were offering a free bagel with schmear with the purchase of any beverage.  We did not need a coupon.  Yeah!  

I was pleasantly surprised to see Green Chile Cheese Bagels that I have bought in Albuquerque and Denver.

They had balloons all over to celebrate the festivities.  The line was long to place an order, but she repeated back to me my order for accuracy.  The 2 gals at the cash register were just waiting to ring people up.  The tables needed to be wiped off.

A manager came by to see how everything was.  I would come back."}
{"text":"Slowest service in Chandler. The last time I was there one person was in line ahead of me and it took 20 minutes to get my bagels."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service! Ordered a bagel and large coffee. Coffee station was clean and refilled with condiments. Staff was friendly and made the experience enjoyable. Being a block away from the office, I might be here for a daily coffee run!"}
{"text":"I am normally a huge fan, however I was grossed out by one of the employees sanitation. She was ringing in orders with gloves on and proceeded to pull bagels with the same gloves, then went out to the lobby collected baskets and didn't even bother washing them. Took them straight to the line and started using them. I mentioned this to the shift manager and all he could say was sorry and asked the employee to change her gloves. Throughout the time I sat there there was more,\"I'm sorry\" from the manager. Don't think I will be back to this location."}
{"text":"Really crappy that when I come in it's not even a hi it starts with \"we can make whatever sandwich but only have the bagels that are in the case.\" That should have been the sign to leave but I continued to look and place an order with one of their \"gourmet\" bagels. I go to charged out and noticed it was more and made a remark that I feel it's a little messed up that you only have \"gourmet\" bagels and you turn around and charge me more for my sandwich. It was like talking to the wall. The cashier said nothing just handed me the receipt and walked away."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today. The parking lot was open, however the selection spaces are limitied. There is a burger king and a subway right next it. With the Burger Kings drive-thru literally right across the small parking lot, you could get blocked in from exiting depending on the parking space you select. So be careful!! Upon walking into the bagel shop, I was pleasantly surprised. All of the guests were happy and everything was relatively clean for a Tuesday morning. The staff was friendly, with a big smile on their faces, especially considering how busy it is. I ordered two sandwiches - the bacon, egg, cheese on a asiago bagel and the chicken hash brown sandwich. I didnt have to wait long on my order, about 5-10 minutes considering the amount of people in the location. The reason why I am giving it 4 out of 5 is because my order was wrong(and unfortunately I had already left since I got it to go). There was sauce on the chicken sandwich and I had asked for plain. Its okay though! Good thing I got a backup breakfast sandwich! : )"}
{"text":"Okay so I'm a regular at this location. Just about every day my son and I come in for a coffee, smoothie and a couple of bagels. I spend about $15 4 days a week and each morning they stamp a makeshift coffee card from a business card they have. This morning I was told there are no longer going to honor the free coffee after 5 stamps. I have to say I was very disappointed to hear that. Although I do think the staff is excellent, I also think that giving a free coffee to a regular is not too much to ask for. I will be heading back into Cave Creek to the coffee shops I use to go to."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The place is very busy on a Sunday morning,i ordered two bagels, not toasted, not sliced, and two sides of cream cheese. I've been standing and waiting for fifteen minutes thus far just for them to place two bagels in a paper bag so that I can leave. They've put me in a queue behind all other orders, which I can understand, but when my order requires NO prep I shouldn't have to sit and wait this long. 

It's simple mismanaged."}
{"text":"I want to say that the food is always delicious here in my experience, and that is the reason for the second star. However the 1 star service is definitely sub par, when my bagel arrived there was more toppings on the tray than on the bagel, and they were very stingy on the toppings to begin with."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie. The service is awful. I come here a lot and I feel that an order is either always screwed up or they are fixing something they screwed up for someone else. It feels like a frat house when I walk in, people cackling, loud objects being dropped, stuff being spilled. (By the way, it is 1:00 pm on a Sunday???) Plus, while I waited to check out, this girl, Cara, sat on the phone talking to a customer like a 13-year-old girl, while the customer complained about getting the wrong order and Cara said the customer will get something free next time. (WHAT????)  If I was an owner I'd clean house. Check out the Ahwatukee location for the best Einsteins. They all have personalities, but aren't obnoxious and wasting the owners money.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"So I came in earlier today... (8:30 on 5/27/15), and ordered a non-toasted Everything bagel with Garlic Herb cream cheese. There was a horrific line, but it was zipped through fairly quickly. After waiting for 5 minutes to get my food, the food runner (middle aged man with a European accent)  called my name and then confirmed... \"Everything bagel with plain?\" I was rushed and said \"Plain? It's supposed to be garlic herb?\"

He then proceeded to take my bagel out of the bag, open it towards him (so I couldn't see) and said \"oh yeah!\"  \"It's garlic herb?\" I questioned. \"Yeah\" he said, put the bagel back in the bag and held it out toward me. I laughed (somewhat rudely, I apologize) because the man roughly defiled my bagel while we were standing by the windows and then basically dismissed me to leave. I took the bagel (hey, I paid for it) and walked out feeling like it was a 3-4 star experience. 

I get into my car and drive off. When I finally got a chance to eat my bagel, I bite into it. Plain cream cheese? That guy CHECKED MY BAGEL AND LIED TO ME!!!

I am not so much of a priss where my order cannot be wrong. It's happened before and I deal, graciously and more often than not just eating what I was given. HOWEVER, DO NOT LIE TO ME. He looked at my shmear, saw it was wrong, and told me it was fine.  Ugh!!!  If he's lying to customers, what else is he lying about? Not a good look my man. 

My bagel is the EASIEST THING EVER to remake. I am SUPER LOYAL to Einstein's, but I am DONE with this location."}
{"text":"I think everyone should boycott this location! In this season of love and friendship to fellow human beings, this location has chosen to force their land lord to evict one of the plaza's dearest friends. This women not only keeps the place looking nice bur she also keeps the area around there safe and comfortable to sit and enjoy your food. She has been a staple to this location longer then they have been there! So bad form Einstein Bros. You just lost my patronage as well as that of all my friends. Bad Bad form!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love that this company took the time to include a doggy treat option at their establishment it's always nice to see that a company respects people with animals. As for the food I was pleasantly surprised I got the turkey sausage breakfast sandwich on a toasted plain bagel and honestly it was really good! The servers here are all very upbeat and have a smile which is always a nice way to start your morning and the service was fast so I was able to get in and out fairly quick which is also a nice selling point. I like that it is in a convenient part of town too just hop in and out and bang you are on the highway maybe other people don't care about that part but I love it! Regardless I will be visiting here much more often now that I know the food is great!"}
{"text":"We came in five mintes to close, which I know sucks for any business. We waited and waited, someone finally appeared from the back. She immediately told us they were closed (which they were by this point) and that she forgot to change the sign and lock the door. Whats great is that they had the pasteries we wanted, and would have paid for. Now they'll be throwing them out since its the end of day. Waste of food and crappy customer service. We're heading to an independent bakery now, hopefully they know how to even basically function."}
{"text":"Einsteins coffee game is STRONG!  First thing I do when I wake up is head to einsteins and take advantage of there bottomless coffee.  I drink 3 coffees a day so I am WIRED!"}
{"text":"I would be amazed if my order was EVER right.  Ordered a thin bagel toasted.  Received a regular bagel not toasted.  Asked for potato salad for my side, received fruit.  Literally some of the most incompetent people working here.  Also their restrooms are disgusting.  Hope their corporate pays more attention soon."}
{"text":"Dunkin Donuts quality food here.  Microwaved egg sandwiches.  Took 15 minutes to get my food.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Good bagels are hard to find in Phoenix...and not surprising, this place is on par with chain bagel spots. 
The service was good but the bagels were meh...
I must say that for the area, it's a good choice to get your carb fix. 
Think steps below Panera's...
It's located in a hotel and gets quite busy."}
{"text":"Regardless of how the food tastes, the customer service was horrible. I asked for a smoothie and the guy literally groaned. After paying, I smiled and said thank you and he just curtly nodded. Also had to watch them drink the part of my smoothie that didn't fit into the cup. Wow. Horrible."}
{"text":"I have to been numerous Einstein's restaurants for over 20 years around the valley, and have found them to be reliably consistent with the food, service and general premises  cleanliness. 

for the second time in 2 months, I had breakfast at this location. The first time I went, I thought \"hmm, they must be having a bad day,\" with regard to the filthiness of the ladies' room, the tables, the floor, the soda dispenser rust, and obviously cloudy and foul iced tea. 

My experience this time was worse. there were at least 6 people I could count behind the counter, and the person that greeted and waited on us appeared very much impaired. . He asked us 4 times if our order was a specific Danish, which should not have been an order worthy of repeating at least several times. 

My experience with the rest room today  is that it was outright disgusting;  no paper towels, no soap, and a toilet that someone had been very sick in very recently. I would think with minimal customers today and at least 6  adolescents doing nothing behind the counter, maybe  one or some of the staff could clean the bathroom, floors, tables and soda dispensers. 

I hope whoever owns this franchise location sees this. I cannot imagine ordering anything more complicated  than a toasted bagel ( when I frequently order and very much enjoy the wonderful breakfast and lunch sandwiches at the other locations). Logically, if I am thinking,  that I wouldn't order a sandwich in a disgustingly dirty place, this has to affect your profits and bottom line. 

I was going to call the Health Department, but don't need the hassle. Disgustingly dirty restaurants are a gamble at best when it comes to food handling, caveat emptor (if you go, be very wary!)"}
{"text":"Been to many different locations across the valley, and I go out of my way to hit this one. It's tucked back in the corner of the shopping center, however the staff ALWAYS greets me with a smile and makes sure I feel my business is appreciated. Turn around time in and out is usually pretty quick too."}
{"text":"I've walked out of this location 4 separate times. No organization. Wonder why the ratings are so low? The workers need training on the product and customer service."}
{"text":"Great bagels....and super yummy coffee.

The men's bathroom is horrible however and needs to be redone.  Seen better bathrooms in freeway rest stops."}
{"text":"Every week I would have a coffee here before teaching class.  The staff are super friendly and helpful.   The restaurant is always immaculate and has a great environment for getting work done or socializing."}
{"text":"Einstein Bros., I want to love you...I really do...you are making it soooo damn hard.

I have to interject here that, like the review before me, this applies to one location only (mostly).

You're convenient, really close to home and the coffee is really good. The bagels are good..they really are. So why do you have to cheap out on the amount of  ingredients in the sandwiches? Are you not making enough profit??? Come on, now...

I kinda stopped coming here a while ago because at $5.49 for a Nova Lox and Bagel I kind of want to at least have the bagel moistened with cream cheese  and have a couple more chips of lox on there with the 3 or 4 capers that garnish it. Ok, I might be over exaggerating a bit, but really, they go rather thin at this location. So I stopped coming here and would go to Desert Ridge to get my occasional fix.

Fast forward to present. Got a bunch of coupons in the newspaper and decided to give it a second chance, so have come here 3 times in the past week. Here are my experiences (note that experience #1 is going to be corporate, across the board and has nothing to do with quantity and everything to do with design and marketing):

1. Came in with coupon for new bagel poppers and coffee to enjoy on business road trip to Sedona. Poppers are featured in a cup with a lid leading one to believe they are an easy to eat finger food. DON\"T BE FOOLED! The cream cheese poppers have a coating on them so slick that when you grab one between two fingers in explodes from your hand and projectiles into your windshield where it sticks and slowly slides off. Ok, not really, but seriously, I couldn't get them out of the cup, they kept slipping out of my fingers. I bought their self named car cup to only find out that it didn't fit in my cup holder and the first gentle turn I made out of the mall had the cup in my lap and me dancing in a seat of hot coffee. Add to that the aggravation that the guy taking the order wasn't sure how to ring it up because I got the car cup and....

#2  This actually went ok. Second coupon and things went smoothly, coffee good, bagel fresh and while cream cheese was a little thinner than what I like was adequate.

#3  Now today....ohhhh, today. I was ravenous...ate too lightly for dinner last night and didn't make it out of the house for breakfast until almost 10am. So, today's coupon is buy one bagel, get one free. Never thought about how much that schmear of cream cheese was until I had to actually look at the menu...$1.50, ok, times two bagels, 3 bucks, well, ok. Asked to have my two bagels toasted with cream cheese. First they come to me and inform me that they were out of one of my bagels. Ok. Then, when my order is called up the guy doing so makes fun of my name (my nickname is 'Cia, most think it very pretty, but it kind of loses its charm when the guy behind the counter yells out \"Cia! [snicker] C-I-A!). Went to pick up the bagels and the cream cheese was scraped on sooo thin it was almost none existent. Complained...got a dirty look from the guy that spelled my name and the guy that took my order \"informed\" me that if I wanted it thicker I needed to ask for \"heavy\" when I placed my order...yeah, dude, uhhhm, I just wanted to actually be able to SEE the cream cheese on the bagel before I ate it. And the punchline? Get back to my table and it turns out one of the bagels wasn't even toasted.

Einstein's...is it so hard to get it right? One out of three experiences in a week's time acceptable is, well, kind of unacceptable."}
{"text":"A hometown staple :) I was just reminded of this location on Sunday, when my dad woke up early to bring home some bagels for breakfast. I am guessing there are only two reviews because it is just a chain, and hence it doesn't need a reputation boost. However, I think it's important to point out when certain franchise locations excel! The place always appears clean, the bagels come nice and chewy, there is often a line of patrons, and just all around is a good place to visit in Chagrin! They also often have coupons and deals sent out int he area, which is a tasty incentive."}
{"text":"Einsteins bagels is great for breakfast, snacks, and even lunch. They have a wide variety of bagels including some of my personal favorites, jalepeno cheddar and asiago cheese. They have a new pretzel bagel which my mom loves too. Shmear is their fancy name for cream cheese and my favorites are strawberry and the jalepeno one. They have low fat options and even a light menu for breakfast and lunch options. I suggest getting there earlier in the morning when the bagels are right out of the oven and they have more options because nothing is worse than them not having your favorite bagel. 

The luck dozen boxes are fairly priced and are great for work parties or special events. I personally like getting two shmears so that everyone is happy. Also the coffee is pretty good but their fresh squeezed orange juice is great! 

I love going to Einstein Brothers Bagels in Vegas when I'm with my dad every morning and I'm really upset they took the location off the UNR campus."}
{"text":"Definitely won't be coming back to this location. Probably won't be dining in at Einstein again. I was greeted with \"Hey how are you?\" As the girl stared into the distance. A little annoying but I'm sadly used to people not knowing how to interact with others in person. 

Main issue was another customer ordered food \"for here\" and the workers had run out of trays. So a worker on the line collected trays from above the garbage cans and immediately put them back onto the line above food. The man asked if I saw that as well and proceeded to inquire about the lack of sanitation. His concern was met with \"I don't know, this is my third day ask her\".  So he asked her, she mumbled one word responses of no real value. The guy walked away feeling like the interaction was pointless. 

I asked to speak with a manager. He stated that the trays are lined with paper so they never come into contact with food and that it was a company policy. Only if they're physically dirty do they get washed. That's a horrible unsanitary process. The food is HOPEFULLY clean. It's the people using the trays that might not be. 

Please change this policy and train your employees to genuinely interact and show concern for customers."}
{"text":"Service is really slow (in spite of being the only customers here), the place is filthy and some of their machines we're broken. Also, they had no turkey for the turkey panini.  I don't think we'd be coming back here."}
{"text":"This is an Einstein Bagels. It has all the options of other locations. What sets this store apart and makes it not worth your visit is the horrible customer service.
I honestly don't know why I keep coming back to this store. It's probably because I love Einstein's and it's on my way to work but I have never had a good experience in this store. From long waits to rude, inattentive employees to running out of food, my visits are always a complete disappointment. Today, the employee was nice enough and I didn't have to wait long (there was only one person ahead of me), but he made my Vanilla Hazelnut Latte without ANY coffee. It's just milk and flavoring. Now I'm here at work and I have to go back to make this right. Extremely frustrating. 
In the past there were several employees behind the counter and many just standing there, doing nothing. Today there were only two employees. Maybe he was stressed out because they were understaffed? I don't know. But the only surprise I'm feeling is why I even continue to go here when Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks are closer to my work."}
{"text":"I typically don't go here for anything more than a bucket of bagels with cream cheese, but this time we stopped by for some breakfast sandwiches and coffee before a road trip.

I had the Nova Lox sandwich on an asiago bagel, omg so good! The lox was very tasty and not too smokey flavored and it had just the right amount of cream cheese. I also had an iced coffee with white mocha which was a bit sweet, but overall very tasty.

I'll definitely have to get here more for their other sandwiches and lunch options. Very friendly & quick service too!"}
{"text":"I saw the old reviews and almost didn't go, but was staying at the hotel and lacked motivation to go elsewhere. Glad to see they made improvements in areas of prior complaints. Place was busy, staff was moving fast and was friendly. Even had a good amount of cream cheese on the bagel. A positive experience."}
{"text":"The bagels are good. The sandwiches leave something to be desired in the taste department and the coffee is over roasted. Everything is a bit over-priced for what you get. I have never had a problem with the customer service."}
{"text":"I don't really know why I have been to this place more than once. But because I have, I feel confident in my low score.

First of all, no matter when you come in - lunch hour or in the middle of the afternoon when there's no one in there at all - you have to wait forever!  How long does it seriously take to put cream cheese on a bagel?

Secondly, i don't love their food that takes 6 hours to make. The sandwhich combinations aren't the best. And their everything bagels have an overpowering rye taste --- this might be a preference issue. But alas. 

I am not going back. I mean it this time. For serious."}
{"text":"Let me tell you why Einstein inside the Hyatt is awesome.

During this years Phoenix Comicon we've been looking for places for breakfast and had no idea this was even inside the hotel.  We usually opted for Starbucks across the street.  

Einsteins really stepped up to the plate though.  During the day they usually closed at 2 or 3PM, but with comicon being in town they extended their hours til 8PM.  That's customer service for ya!

I complimented them for doing that and the staff couldn't have been more nice and excited to be a part of the event that weekend.

I give them 5 stars because their food is always awesome and their staff was just as great!"}
{"text":"Honey Whole Wheat, double toasted, with butter and peanut butter... 

Don't go \"ewww that's gross!!\"  try it. . it's delicious.

So that's my order every time I go to Einsteins and guess what? These guys are the one location that can make it just perfect.  I live right next to one and I had to ask them to triple toast it one time because their toaster was set to \"warm blown air\"  .. well not really, but it seemed like it.  Then the girl putting on the peanut butter, might as well have been using a tea spoon for the tiny amount she gave me.

So not to bash that location.. but yes, this place just rocked.  they are super fast and if you get there at the right time, there is no wait."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of Einsteins for a long time.  This is my first time at this location.  I always order a peanut butter schmear bagel, twice toasted.  Usually the places never understand what that means, and it's never right.

They got it right.

I ordered my bagal and literally watched her toast my bagel twice.  Mind you, she had about 10 other orders going on, but I saw her do it.  I was a happy camper.

That alone made this trip worth the 4 stars.  Why not 5?  Because holy crap, this place is busy on a weekend morning.  From walking in til I got my bagal, it was a good 15minutes.  Good thing the food is good.

if I could recommend one thing to them. Please empty your trash cans outside. People couldn't throw anything away because they were overflowing..."}
{"text":"No Stars for this location!!!!! The place was filthy!!! The young lady who took my order got it completely wrong!! Didn't give me my doggie bagels and when i went back to get them they refused to give me a bag for them!!! They told me to put them in the same bag as my sandwich!!!!! OMG!!!! REALLY????!!!! NEVER EVER EVER!!! NEVER coming back to this location again!!!!!"}
{"text":"I paid for parking just to find out that they have their doors locked during business hours. How horribly mismanaged."}
{"text":"Einstein Bros is great but this is a bad location. Poor customer service and they will kick you out before closing time if the employees feel like going home early."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way to work, at 5am not much choices. I have been coming to Einstein's for years. The guy was friendly, fast, I only ordered a wheat bagel with cream cheese and a large coffee. Bagel seemed fresh with just the right amount of cream cheese, they can sometimes get carried away. Its an old reliable for me so I'll be back."}
{"text":"Einstein's is always a solid spot for some good bagels. I like the fact that they offer a whole grain option. Their other bagels are all pretty good as well. The only complaint I have is they do not carry soy or almond milk to put in my coffee. This location is located next door to a Starbucks, so I just head next door for coffee after I grab my bagels."}
{"text":"Went to this location this morning for the first time in a long time. Usually, all I get is a bagel or two and I am out. But this morning my girlfriend and I wanted a little more for breakfast so I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich on a plain toasted bagel while she ordered an everything bagel with a plain spread. We ordered it to eat there as we had a good amount of time to eat. We sat down to wait, and we waited and waited for about 20 minutes. During this time she went and got a Jamba Juice smoothie while I waited for our food. While I was waiting I saw Employees run out the door to hug a friend, text on their phone at the cash register, and run in and out of the back laughing. The Employee who took my order even served another group that was sitting right next to us and walked right by us and I even made eye contact with him and our food still wasn't given to us. I was very annoying seeing employees run around and laugh on their phones and run outside to hug a friend so I finally went up to the counter and asked about our food and they simply just skipped over us and \"totally forgot\" as the employee put it. They hurried our order and even gave us a refund but by this time we just asked for our food to go and ate our food in the car on our drive back. 

This place must seem to have this problem a lot based on other Yelp reviews. Hopefully, they fix this as Einsteins is one f my favorite places to go to when I can. PLEASE FIX YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE AT THIS LOCATION!"}
{"text":"I occasionally come in here when I get deals sent to me ($2 off, BOGO breakfast sandwiches, etc...). I also occasionally take advantage of the 6 bagels for $7 on Monday deal. 

It's okay. 

I'm not a bagel connoisseur, but they seem okay from here. I've had better (and worst). The breakfast sandwiches are okay as well. Either the one w/bacon or turkey sausage are just fine. 

Service is hit or miss. Sometimes I come in here and they're clearly understaffed. I generally have pretty small orders (just myself or maybe one other person, but sometimes I can wait awhile for something pretty simple. 

I'm not a big fan of the coffee here, but if there's an email deal involving it I'll drink it. 

So yeah, when I'm in the area & I have a coupon for something that sounds good from here I'll stop in. I don't go out of my way, though."}
{"text":"Everyone was very friendly. The restaurant was clean. I ordered a turkey sandwich on a bagel it was great and the cup of fruit that came with it was great too. I have nothing negative to say about this place."}
{"text":"I love Einstein Bagels. I go bag as often as I can.. The service is great and the staff is very friendly. I went to the one on Bell Rd. and 7 St a while back and the store is not very organized."}
{"text":"For quick but good breakfast, Einstein's serves up consistent food. From their coffee to their wide assortment of bagels and bagel sandwiches, I've always received friendly service and my meals are made in a short amount of time. I recently had a cool and refreshing iced vanilla hazelnut soy latte and a green chile bagel with jalapeno salsa cream cheese. The bagel itself was light and airy, with a nice toasted outer crust. The center was a little doughy though. The jalapeno cream cheese was very flavorful and had a great spicy kick to it. 

There's also a shaded patio outside and when the weather is nicer, people often bring their dogs for a breakfast outing with their pups."}
{"text":"Waited like 20 minutes for a dozen bagels . Finally got home and the box with the bagels opened up from the bottom and all the bagels fell onto the driveway . Brought them back and was reluctantly given a refund and the doofus manager still tried to charge me for the cream cheese even though I had know bagels . Definitely won't be going back !"}
{"text":"Obviously same fare as all the other Einstein Brothers. But this one has two particular problems: Mornings, there are no seats available partially due to a particular large group of regular Seniors who frequent this place to read the paper and chat. Second, it's probably the busiest Einstein's and is poorly managed in the morning, resulting in longer than normal waits. If you have options, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"No coffee brewed for 30 minutes before they they a moment to get ONE carafe going. Then it was out before I could get to it thanks to the 30 people who were also waiting for it. 
Bagels were dry, even for bagels, on both my bagel sandwiches. And somehow they confused \"ham and Swiss\" for \"egg and cheddar\". Sounds the same I guess??
Go to Starbucks across the parking lot instead. We did."}
{"text":"Einstien Bros felt like our typical chain bagel house.  It's not bad nor exceptional .  I'm still waiting for one that can top my current favorite place, Bagel Me."}
{"text":"Simply one of the most friendliest einsteins around and very efficient, seems like they really care about there customers... :)"}
{"text":"I've never heard of this place until one of reps would bring them every time he came and visit. So, I figure I give it a try. I like that fact that the locations all have consistent taste. I've been to the one in Torrance, Pasadena, and now LV.  

This place had plenty of parking and it's a great way to start the day before you loose all your money at the casinos! LOL."}
{"text":"Picked up a dozen bagels, cream cheese and a large tub of coffee for my workers the other day. 
Service was quick and friendly, bagels were delicious and coffee was good. My guys we're glad I stopped by the job site for sure. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Einstein's is the only bagel shop I go to. I love all of the varieties of bagels and shmears. I can never limit myself to just one. I don't recommend this place if you can't enjoy a good carb. I mean seriously IT'S A BAGEL SHOP. Don't get me wrong, they have options for the calorie counter and fat phobic out there. 
This review is for those who love a good chunk of bread fresh out of the oven. That's what I love about them. The bagels in sandwiches, or toasted with butter and sugar... Maybe a dozen plus a couple containers of your favorite schmear. Even lox. The Juices are fresh and dated and the staff is friendly. 
Einstein's is the one and only place for your bagel needs in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee.  I love the ice tea/lemonade.  Everyone is so  friendly.  Whether we drive thru or eat outside-everyone is so nice to Anthony-my German Shepherd.  Please get a frequent customer card like Starbucks!"}
{"text":"This place has the best breakfast sandwiches in town! Fresh, delicious sandwiches each time and wonderful staff always makes my day here!"}
{"text":"Einsteins is my favorite bagel chain and I enjoy visiting them on my travels as well as at home. Been a customer for years. This particular location needs help. Not clean in the indoor seating area and downright trashy in the outside seating! The young lady at the register was impossible to understand and she was a born English speaker. Service was totally off the mark. Food was  good, love the Turkey  sandwich on everything bagel. This location just needs help!'"}
{"text":"What a delightfully pleasant little cafe to start a day of hiking. 

My friend and I were set to go up the Mountains Edge Trails to jumpstart our week with a workout and with that, we knew we needed energy. Einstein Bros Bagels just happened to be on the way so we stopped by and ordered ourselves some food. I ended up with one of their 'egg-citing creations' - the turkey sausage and cheddar with my choice of spinach florentine bagel and a hot chocolate. Delish!!

It had a very friendly, family-oriented ambiance to it although a far cry from sambalatte's more sophisticated & sociable vibe, it brought in the much needed energy for the day and the spinach really helped charge me up!"}
{"text":"Visited this morning for a bagel after a long election night. This was my first visit in about 5 years and I am accustom to Einsteins heavy application of shmear. Maybe they have changed this because I did not get what I was accustom to :( I wouldn't refer customers to order To-Go"}
{"text":"Just ok. I feel like this chain was better back in the day. Now the beagles are kinda rubbery poofy. Like sponge with a leathery hide. Good coffee though."}
{"text":"So upsetting. It was 945am ONLY ONE PERSON working.. The line kept building. Finally a lady came out from the back with absolutely no sense of urgency. She didn't look up, didn't wash her hands, didn't apalogize for the long wait. It was very frustrating... It's like the moment you realize you made a mistake by stopping here to waste my hard earned money. Ahhh! She either couldn't hear the guy on register or she was ignoring him when he was giving the orders.. So she wasn't helping she was creating more work.. After our patience ran out my husband walked over to ask for our order and he was ignored. The even worse part was that i convinced my husband to come here because i thought it was good.. Big mistake. The café area was clean but that's about all it had going for it. 

It took forever to get my order and when i finally did my bagel was cold and stale. It was a toasted sesame bagel with cream cheese smear. My husbands plain bagel was also barely toasted and cold. 
The choco chip muffin was delish i might go there for that. But that's so sad! I should want a bagel. I've had Einsteins bagels before in Houston and they were so good! I don't know what's going on with this place. 

This place needs some help. They are easy fixes.. Basic customer service with speed and fresh bagels. The coffee was ok but my educated guess is that it was brewed hours ago."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to this location frequently because it's close to our office. It doesn't compare in terms of cleanliness and service to the one near our home on Gilbert Rd in Mesa. 
Today, we needed to order 2 dozen bagels and two containers of coffee for a work meeting. We started calling them at 5:30 this morning, which is a half hour after they opened. The phone just rang off the hook and although we tried several times, no one answered. We ended up having to place the order with the Einstein's near our home. They answered and got the order instead of this location. We doubt we will give them any future corporate business. 2 stars just for having good bagels and coffee."}
{"text":"Gave them another try....I ask for a little more cream cheese, since I could see through it on my bagel.
I was told we only give 1 ounce per bagel...? YadaYada...Told another lady the same thing when she ask for more cream cheese.  Idiot that is all I can say---"}
{"text":"The fact that Einstein Bagels is usually massed with patrons in the morning is a sign that the Las Vegas Valley has a need for more bagel shops.
   After living in New York, Einstein Bagels trails behind mom and pop bagel shops in value and quality. For the record Einstein Bagels attempted to go into the New York market, and failed in a couple months. A BLT special with coffee in a New York bagel shop is a great deal less expensive than Einstein Bagels.
  At any rate, this is a good place to have breakfast. It is convenient to Henderson's Galleria Mall business district. Theirs coffee, with unlimited refills, is coffee shop quality. And there is a sufficient amount of vacant parking spaces at the adjoining vacant Borders.
  On this visit they slightly jumped the shark by not letting customers order the $5 BLT special to noon. C'mon. Still it was not much of a jump to lower my rating."}
{"text":"This Einstein is not smart. The number of mistakes they made on my order, brother's order, and a customers order is stuff a business can only get away with in an airport concession. I ordered a toasted blueberry bagel with salmon shmear. They didn't toast my bagel. My brother ordered a toasted bagel without cream cheese. They did not toast his bagel plus they added a bagel with cream cheese that they charged him for. When I poured my dark roast coffee another customer brought it to their attention that they gave her the wrong bagel. We were about to board a plane for Chicago and didn't sweat over the small stuff.

  Obviously the Terminal B Einstein Brothers Bagels is not sweating over the small stuff such as their bagels. It leaves a poor impression on the business when they are out of sesame and poppy seed bagels at 6 in the morning. But they sweat over the big stuff: making a profit. The bagel with salmon smear and coffee that costs me $5 and a few pennies at a local Einstein Brothers Bagels costed about $6.50 here. 

  Two things save this location from my pending \"Mad Check-ins: 1 Star places that Annoy Me\" list. Although the employees need to be trained to comprehend what the customer is ordering and to learn to toast a bagel they made the wrong orders fast and with a smile. And the coffee was strong and favorable on the tadte buds. It is the same setup with all the Einstein Bagels where you serve your own coffee. And that is a good thing because if I was pouring it I know it would not be decaffeinated.  

  What this location has going for it is its location beyond security. Because their isn't much competition beyond the security gate,  especially at 6 a.m.; Einstein Brothers Bagels is in a position to charge more and continue to run a 2 star business. In the future I will try to leave more time so that I could have a 3 star or above breakfast experience anyplace else before a flight."}
{"text":"Einstein has become a genius.  Einstein Bagels has introduced value to their menu (a complaint I posted in past reviews was a need for value meals) with a Value Breakfast and Value Lunch.

  The $3.99 Value Breakfast includes a bagel and shmear with a medium coffee. In bagel lingo, shmear is another name for spread.  I will yelp that my taste buds cherish a toasted bagel with nova lox spread. When it comes to taste, my taste buds also cherish their bottomless coffee. Einstein Brothers Bagels have always served quality coffee. There are four choices of coffee that are unlimited refills.A nice feature is that the time the coffee was brewed is written by the coffee station.

  The $5.99 lunch special includes any deli sandwich with a medium fountain drink and chips or potato salad. A lack of a side item was a past complaint that I addressed.

  I myself am not a genius. I do have an intuition that Einstein Bagels Value Menus have added to the bagel experience in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"When it comes to bagels, Einstein Bagels is 3 5 star good. However, they are nothing in comparison to the Bagel Cafe and New York bagel shops. Since there is only one bagel cafe and the New York bagel shops are nearly 3,000 miles away, my tastebuds coexist with Einstein Bagels.

    Today, I stopped off at this Einstein Bagels on the way to Spring Mountains National Recreation Area. It is off the 215 Freeway along Durango Drive and just south of Centennial Hills Hospital. It was a breeze to get to.

  The experience I had at this location is really no different than the other Einstein Bagels I reviewed. I walked in. I ordered and gave them my name. I walked past the display case of bagels where I paid. The cashier handed me a coffee cup before they brought me my bagel. I had the choice of few brews of coffee to fill the cup. The coffee is on a par with the coffee house chains. The way that I could tell the coffee us good is that I don't need syrup in it. The refills are unlimited. A few minutes after sitting down, I was biting into the toasted sesame bagel with salmon shmear. The bagel was 3.50 star good. That puts it on the same league as a Dunkin Donuts bagel. The coffee and bagel with salmon shmear duo came out to $5.01. Not bad! But not spectacular! My complaint about Einstein Bagels, which is the exact one that dates back to my 2012 review on this company is that they don't include a side item like a pickle or potato salad. It takes some getting used to when the New York bagel shops would include potato or macaroni salad and a pickle with the meal. Even their more $ nova lox sandwiches don't include a side. Maybe thats why Einstein Bagels only lasted around three months in the New York market.

  When I returned to my car, I drove toward Durango Drive with no enthusiasm for Einstein Bagels. If Dunkin Donuts was on the right side of the road I probably would of chosen it over Einstein Brothers. My realty is that because Einstein Bagels is all Vegas really has for bagel shops with the exception of Bagel Cafe and a couple others, I will settle for 3.5 star bagels."}
{"text":"People on here are way too harsh. Every time I come here the bagels are good and the service is awesome! Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love the bagels here. They are tasty and always taste fresh. I would eat here for breakfast every weekend if I could! 

However, some locations are better than others- they are not always consistent."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: It was in an airport. Not really much to say here. Good set up so you can grab what you need  for your coffee, or your bagel to the left of the stand.

Service: Fast, friendly and efficient. Could not complain about the price of the bagels with shmear (cream cheese-West coast thing). This was probably the least amount we paid for any food in vegas for the entire trip. 

Food: Who doesn't love einstein bros. bagels, so fresh, so flavorful, and a great variety of options for any one ordering."}
{"text":"Well, I was kinda surprised when I see their yelp reviews are so low but I should say, I left the place with a great smile and satisfaction on my face. I ordered two dozen of bagels and it was for a particular breakfast event for kids. Normally I know they don't toast them but I asked them if there would be a way to do so and they kindly accepted my request and toasted all of those bagels. It was just a good experience overall I should say."}
{"text":"Friendly staff!

These guys and gals really know their bagels. The manager Bill I believe is his name seems like he really loves his job.

Bagels and coffee are consistently good, and fresh. Service is fast. Bathrooms are clean. Floor of store and tables were clean. I only wish they would open the drive through back up!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been frequenting this establishment for many years now.  Up until the past few months, we typically received exceptional service, great value and freshly prepared food with many options.  However, we have noticed a study decline in customer service over the past few months and today was the absolute worst experience thus far.  So bad that we will not be patronizing this venue in the future. We literally had to repeat our order nineteen times, it still came out wrong and it took forever to get the order.  We ordered two bagel sandwiches with chips. Luckily, the only redeeming thing they did was not charge us for the order, however the awful customer service was not worth it.  I don't know what has happened with management and their employees but we are sorely disappointed in the decline in customer service as well as the limited selection of bagels for lunch time. The staff has become rude, unaccommodating and for lack of better words, ghetto in their demeanor. I am not one to write a bad review unless I am fed up with something that has become a repeated problem.  It's a shame because this restaurant was one of me and my families all time favorites for breakfast and lunch for many years.  I hope for the business' sake that they utilize reviews like these to improve upon their customer service and any other issues at hand."}
{"text":"This location is the epitome of disorganization and poor customer service. I blame this on the management, but really even the one or two helpful employees don't have their hearts in this job. The bagels are consistent with what you'd expect from Einstein's. You're better off getting a bucket to go and getting out of the store as fast as you can. If you're silly enough to stay be prepared for disappointment. I would never have believed that you could screw up toasting a bagel but these people make an art of botching your order. The staff are apathetic and really could not care less about getting your order right. I think they are only able to stay in business because of the Starbucks next door. I wouldn't have given it any stars if that were possible."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and always receive speedy, efficient service.  I usually opt for the bakers dozen bucket which comes with two tubs of cream cheese for $14.25. They have several different flavors  of cream cheese to choose from. (Onion/chive, garlic herb, garden veg, salmon, honeyn etc) as well as a plethora of bagel varieties to choose from. I always get some of their fresh squeezed oj as well.   If coffee is more your style they do a variety of specialty coffees (hot and cold) as well as a traditional serve yourself coffee station. They also have to-go coffee boxes (like a box of wine but coffee) which is prefect if your hosting a meeting or its your turn to bring breakfast to the office!

They also serve breakfast sandwiches as well as lunch items."}
{"text":"Service was amazing! My hubby and I haven't been here in months and were craving a bagel. Got the Farmhouse and it was awesome. Little man got a blueberry muffin and tore it up. We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"If you have ever been to an Einstein bagels then you already know the food is good. There is plenty of options on what to put on your bagel and what type of bagel you want. We were waiting in line behind someone trying to make up their mind on what to order and the very friendly male cashier (sorry I wasnt able to get his name) saw that we were ready to order and called us over so we didn't need to wait longer. He was very friendly and had a great sense of humor (you will know who he is lol) and that is why this place gets an extra star. The thing that I did not like about this place is how dirty the establishment was. For a place that sells food I prefer it to be clean but this was not the case. There were food crumbs and trash all over the floor and the coffee area had needed to be wiped down. Also when they called my name and another customer for our food to come up and pick it up the woman handed us the wrong orders and couldn't figure out which one belonged to whom without our help. Overall I would come back to this place if I was in the area and had a craving for bagels but wouldn't drive out of my way"}
{"text":"Super disappointing. 

I wrote a review a few years ago for EB in Miami and I see this location is nothing different.

Coming back from Mardi Gras I had a 3 hour layover and needed fuel/dinner. I decided that a tuna sandwich would be the right move.

Wrong, wrong, wrong. The tuna was the blandest tuna I've ever tasted. There was absolutely no flavor at all except for the pepper jack cheese. 

Add a small water and I paid $16 for chewy edible air. 

I should've just went with a bag of $4 cheetos and skittles from the overpriced airport store instead! 

The staff was very friendly though."}
{"text":"The new employees are the laziest I have ever seen. Go elsewhere if you want to get any bagels.. where are the older awesome employees Einsteins?"}
{"text":"We were very pleased when the service that we received when we arrived shortly before closing time.  Friendly service rates really high in my book!  My sandwich was really good and the blueberry bagel my daughter chose was chocked full of blueberries. So a thumbs up for the food as well.  The one thing keeping this location from five stars is the overall cleanliness of the dining area.  It could just use a good deep cleaning.  The blinds need to be cleaned and the ceiling tiles near the air vents are filthy.  The window sills are riddled with crumbs and the floor needs a good scrubbing.  Take care of those things and this will be a top-notch location."}
{"text":"A good selection of bagels.  Their smear of lite cream cheese, as are their prices, is more than I like."}
{"text":"I come here quite often to pick up bagels for weekend breakfast. The servers are often less than friendly but that's not my biggest complaint about this place. There has to be a way to change the layout so that you don't get bowled over by the stroller brigade while trying to get your coffee. The space next to the coffee machines is used as the main walkway and with tables pushed all the way to the back there is very little space next to the coffee dispensers. If the line gets backed up, between that and all the entitled mamas who think any space should accommodate their hulking strollers and baby carriers it's nearly impossible to fill your coffee without bumping into anyone."}
{"text":"My wife really wanted bagels so we drove about 20 minutes each way to this location.  Ordered bagel sandwich with sausage and the rocket scientists here decided to give me bacon instead.  Advise going somewhere that making a sandwich doesn't strain the brain trust."}
{"text":"I will never step foot in this location of einsteins again.

Yet again they have demonstrated that they are incapable of toasting a bagel. Ordered a sausage and cheddar sandwich- after waiting 20 minutes for my food- cheese was unmelted- bagel soft until of course I complained about it. Microwave!!! yay now I burned my mouth on an even softer bagel. Good bye einsteins. You need to invest in a new toaster, new management, staff that can spell a first name and more customers- because you lost this one to another location. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Einsteins is Einsteins. This is Einsteins beats the one on 44th street but could be more accommodating. My wife asked if they could toss a couple sesame seeds on her pumpernickel bagel and was told no abruptly after they told us last time we were here that it was no problem. The other location at least tried and the sesame seeds taste great on the pumpernickel. In this Einsteins favor however- they know how to use a toaster. :)"}
{"text":"In AZ from Chicago. Ordered the sandwich called Farmhouse something.... and it was delicious. Customer service was friendly!"}
{"text":"Cinnamon toast egg samich is good, but not sure about the sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on egg and American cheese. Coffee is great, I love this place they always get you in and out with out any problems"}
{"text":"We order bagels for my office on a semi-regular basis so I have a working relationship with the catering manager and pick up our bagels from this location. The ordering process is super easy and the pick up was quick and the gentlemen even took everything out to my car for me. I didn't realize that Einstein and Noah's share some similarities, but I was stoked to find out because the chocolate chip coffee cake is to die for. Luckily it wasn't in stock when I stopped in or else I would have been in trouble"}
{"text":"They had one pretzel bagel and 3 plain bagels at 11:00a. I asked if there will be more and they said they're not making anymore. They close at 4:00p. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh bagels of every flavor possible and yummy cream cheese to go with them! I had the nova lox and loved it , it was so fresh and tasty. Service could be a little more friendly and offer more suggestions."}
{"text":"Worst service I ever  had, wait time for a one bag Is over an hour, and management don't give a shit overall horrible place want to waste your time  DON'T go there!!"}
{"text":"Dear Einsteins Bagels,

Go jump off a cliff! Please sell your recipes & coffee to Brueggers or some other company that will manage their stores better than you.

Every time I go into Einsteins something is broken or they are out of 1/2 their bagel selection - so sad because I love their bagels & coffee."}
{"text":"I really have no idea what they put in their coffee, but I haven't had a better pick-me-up from anywhere else! I love to just stop in and grab a cup when I can. 
Of course I loveeee the bagels, lox, cream cheese, tomato, onion and caper combo, my waist line can't always get one! Although, when I do, the salmon is always fresh, along with the bagels. I just wish they would deliver me coffee and then my life would be complete."}
{"text":"Great bagels! Great staff! Taylor is one of my favorite workers here! I absolutely love his personality, and he is always so friendly! I've lived in the area for years and I always see him and the blonde girl too! The bagels here never disappoint, and all the bagels to chose from are delicious!"}
{"text":"Well, when you have an early morning flight out of the B terminal and you're too tired to wander around looking for a decent breakfast, you settle for a quick breakfast of a bagel and cream cheese.  We ordered 2 toasted chocolate chip bagels with cream cheese on the side (I like to be in control of how much cream cheese goes on my bagel!).  The first few bites were edible.  I didn't think much of it since I was hungry and tired and it was \"just a bagel.\"  But then I realized how hard and stale the bagel tasted.  I ended up throwing the rest of it out.  I didn't want to fight in the line to complain, so I'll take it to Yelp and let everyone know that I experienced a stale, hard bagel from this place one early August morning."}
{"text":"Although the food is the same at all these locations,  the staff here is far more friendly than any other location I've been to.  They remember my name and my usual preferences all the time.  The food is always good and I can't find a better jalapeño cream cheese anywhere."}
{"text":"I just went to this location to grab 2 bacon/egg/cheese bagels to go.. It was busy, but the line was not out the door. 
I paid for my order at 10:40am, I was handed my order at 11:06am... Yes, my order took 26 minutes from the time I paid at the register!!!! 
Only 2 stars! 
Come on Einstein, 26 minutes is unacceptable.."}
{"text":"I am on a pumpkin kick this month and knew they had the most amazing pumpkin cream cheese. So off I go and get a tub of it for home with a bunch of bagels. I had wanted a pumpkin latte but they dont do the holiday flavors..thats why 4 stars not 5.
The flavored cream cheese is so creamy and amazing. I will have to stock up on it before the season is over. I will want more after the holidays. I wonder if you can freeze it? I will have to ask next time. It is so addicting. I am enjoying my pumpkin cravings!!
Oh..the bagels are the bomb as well. Crisp on the the outside..soft and chewy inside. Toasted of course!"}
{"text":"Einstein has the whole bagel thing down pat!  Crusty crust with a soft and chewy inside.  They toast so well and their varieties of Schmears are awesome!  I love having odd combos, like the Garlic bagel with Almond Honey Schmear.  

This location was clean and very busy on a Sunday morning.    The staff was very friendly and helpful.   Even though it was busy we were in and out with their \"Hate to Wait\" bucket.  13 bagels with 2 tubs of schmear for $15 --Not bad!"}
{"text":"Nothing better than this place for the best early morning bagels and coffee. Love the quality of the product"}
{"text":"The service here was very good,and  the bagels were fresh. They were out of some of the bagels, which is to be expected after lunch.They do have an outdoor seating area, and a nice bar-style area to sit and look out the window while eating."}
{"text":"We used to love Einstein Bagels but since joining forces with Caribou, it's been disappointing. They are always out of most bagel flavors and the coffee always tastes burnt. I won't waste my time visiting this location or another Einstein/Caribou again."}
{"text":"vegs bagel sandwich is good and fresh flavor."}
{"text":"As much as I love Einsteins, I'm deprived of it because I refuse to deal with the headache that this location is. I've been to many Einsteins locations and none are as slow and disorganized as this one. Unfortunately, this one happens to be the closest to home and on my route to work so I am forced to deal with the nightmare whenever I have a craving for their delicious bagels. This location would have a lot more of my money if they could just make their process more efficient and provide better customer service! It's a miserable experience nearly every time..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was addicted to this Einstein's before we met. He went here every day for almost two years, then I moved in and started making breakfast. We still frequent this location together when I don't feel like cooking. 

I like this location for its large patio and people watching. The new bagel thins are pretty awesome, I get the breakfast sandwich with egg white, asparagus and cheese and it is tasty. Good bagels, consistently good service and friendly employees make this Einstein's stand out."}
{"text":"Coffee was good, although not as hot as normal. Haven't tried the bagel yet but must comment on cleanliness of store. 

One word: gross. 

I'm refraining from using an exclamation mark But must say that they need to step this up. You can tell that deep cleaning doesn't happen there and the bathroom showed it. I'm not going into detail as to what was in there but just trust me that it was gross."}
{"text":"It's about like all of the other Einstein Bros Bagels you've ever been to."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much an abortion. I've been here twice now, once for a quick coffee stop (mediocre coffee), once for lunch today. What's up with them basically whispering your name when your order is ready?

The highlight of my meal (which was actually made correctly, but I had to confirm that my order had chips...they were about to let me pay almost $9 for a veggie sandwich and not take a side) was watching a guy stroke out on a manger after basically everything in his order was wrong.

Word to the wise, you have to know the menu and pricing system better than the staff here."}
{"text":"Does Einstein hire only incompetent people who don't know what they're doing? As I said in my review of the location off FLLW and the 101...this place is an abortion, round two. Like, late-term status.

I don't understand why it's such. a freaking. mess. every time I go here. The problem is, it's about 30 seconds from my house. So I THINK it will be convenient for me. It never is.

I came in around 9:30 a.m. this past Saturday to pick up a quick breakfast before we headed out for the day. The \"quick\" pickup was anything but.

I just don't get why it's so harried/confusing/stressful behind the counter. I also REALLY don't understand why they are so afraid to yell out people's names, rather than just pretty much whisper people's names, then set their bag of food down and turn around meekly and get back to \"working\"...I actually said to the kid working \"YOU NEED TO SPEAK LOUDER.\" My fiance once had his order handed directly to someone else before he had the chance to walk up to it. Really?

By miracles of all miracles, our 2 breakfast sandwiches were correct. (You better believe I checked before I left.) But it's not worth the stress and hassle. Einstein, I hate you bad."}
{"text":"This place always has fast service and great coffee. Eric (star) was amazing and so incredibly helpful/friendly. Really love coming to this location specifically because of him."}
{"text":"Hiw this place is still in business is beyond me.  I have yet to have them get an order correct.  And these aren't hard orders - bagel, toasted, cream cheese. 

It's kind of fun.  Go in, order your food and see what comes out.

The bagels and coffee are good though."}
{"text":"With my modest student budget, I should only be eating those discount $1 bags of bagels from the grocery store...damn you, sweet love affair with Einstein Bagels!

This restaurant is within easy walking distance for university students, but also affords (free) parking for customers.  The building is new and the whole interior feels fresh and bright--just want you want when enjoying your breakfast.

While I sometimes enjoy a \"luxury\" bagel (with crunchy cinnamon or other ingredients baked into the batter), I usually stick to more conventional flavors.  I love the selection of \"plain\" bagel flavors at Einstein: honey whole wheat, sesame, potato, pumpernickle, etc.  The bagels themselves are delicious, but the real silver lining is the schmears (flavored, whipped cream cheeses).  I swear by the honey-flavored schmear, subtly sweet with a sprinkling of almonds.

Sometimes I stop in after work to pick up a batch of bagels for breakfast.  By the late afternoon, the display case has often been plucked clean by earlier crowds.  I'm not sure if there are more bagels waiting in back, but if so, I wish they'd keep their front case stocked."}
{"text":"Although the food is delicious, the service was less than superb today. I ordered a half dozen bagels and once I got home realized only five were in the bag. Also, I purchased a dog bagel, it is hard as a rock. They are always left in an open container, this leads me to believe they are not fresh treats and sit for who knows how long. I wish I would have checked my bag and counted the bagels before I left, but even more than that I wish I didn't have to check my bag at all."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good breakfast thin asparagus mushroom and egg white. Wraps not so much. Asiago toasted with veggie always decent. However please get a better system in place because I've never been able to get out of there in less than 15 min for a bagel!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast food here. Their bagels are to die for! They were open on Easter so I was able to get a nice breakfast in, the other day. I would recommend the Avocado Toast Bagel (only if you're an avocado lover like myself)."}
{"text":"The bagels here are so good! I love the cinnamon sugar one! There was a wait out the door and a 20 minute wait to get food, but that's expected for a bagel place on a Saturday morning. Definitely check this place out if you're looking for a yummy breakfast sandwich or bagel!"}
{"text":"So I went back today, hoping that my experience was a single bad incident. This time I stayed clear of their bagels and went for one of their Italian Grilled Sandwiches, which seemed decent. I secretly hoped that given the price at $7, it would be a tad better than the previous day's horror.

Unfortunately, even as I just opened the sandwich, my stomach screamed in protest. It was the same, gooey, prepared mess as before. The chicken (which wasn't even cut, so the two halves of the sandwich weren't separate) was tough, dry, and flavorless. The vegetables were overdone and gooey. I suspect the whole thing was made in a microwave because even the bread had lost its texture. Needless to say, after a single bite, I donated my meal to the trash can.

I stand by my last review; this place has got to be one of the worst places I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"First of all, when you get here make sure you check in because they have an offer for a free bagel and cream cheese when you use the yelp app. Just a tip for you. I had the cheddar cheese jalapeño bagel with some matching cream cheese and it was delicious, the customer service is impeccable and it is a really great value and asset to the Pittsburgh community. I know this is a chain, but living in NYC , The bagels do not compare. Get to Einstein brothers today! Kthanksbye"}
{"text":"It's a bagel place what more can  I say.  Nice people working there and real friendly.  Always greeted with a smile and a hearty hello.  Plus they will keep making you coffee until they get it right.  I could not decide what I wanted and they made me several choices and was able to taste them all.  Plus the fire place is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, hat it when I impose on these people to wait on me, after all I'm just a customer. Think they all could go back to training and learn what customer service entails!"}
{"text":"This location has changed, hopefully changed management, the atmosphere is much nicer and inviting. The food is great as always and now I want to come back."}
{"text":"Never again! This place is SO slow! Not only that, the last time I went, I had to wait 15 minutes just to pay for my order because the cashier was getting her \"drawer ready\". At 8AM on a Sunday morning????? Another problem was, I ordered an iced coffee with a shot of hazelnut. I was given a plastic cup with some hazelnut in it and instructed to go to the self-serve area and get my ice and coffee. You can guess what happened when i added the hot coffee to the ice. This is no way to serve iced coffee!

I love their bagels and their coffee but I will not be going back here again. What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with the customer service I received at this location.  The workers behind the counter were busy talking to each other and our order ended up getting lost.  It took forever.  After we ate, I still hadn't gotten my coffee I ordered with our food.  I went to the counter and they made an iced coffee.  I had ordered a hot coffee but accepted the iced one because I was just ready to leave at that point."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love Einstein bagels but this has got to be one of the worst ones I have been to. The guy behind the counter was on the phone the whole time while he was taking orders and the service has always been poor. The coffee is never full and the over all appearance is dirty and sub par. I would recommend going to the one off of 101 and chandler if you leave anywhere between the two."}
{"text":"Still love their bagels but....
Stopped in at 11:30 AM on a Saturday and guess what?
No onion bagels or everything. This is only the 9 hundreth time. Simple deduction. Management is retarded. 
They have A serious fear of closing at 5 PM with three unsold onion bagels."}
{"text":"This place is awful I drive 15 minutes out of my way to use alternate location the customer service at this one is so bad!!! The so called manager she is so rude and thinks she is the gift to the world"}
{"text":"Yummy! Loved the bagel with lox!! Wish it came with a slice of lemon :) Staff with helpful. I am trying to eat lighter so I needed suggestions and they delivered! Reduced fat cream cheese w/ a whole wheat bagel!"}
{"text":"Einstein bagels are not absolutely amazing, but it gets the job done when I'm craving a bagel and I'm already in the area. Service is usually painfully slow, but today was such a pain. Ordered two different bagel sandwiches and a new stuffed bagel bite thing to go. Took forever, per usual, to get our food despite no one in line ahead of us and three people behind the counter. They bring it out, but not to go. So they wrap everything up and we are on our way. They forgot the small bagel bite. Both of our sandwiches were the same (we ordered two completely different sandwiches). And there were no napkins or forks for our fruit. One of these days I'll remember it's worth it to just drive five more minutes and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"These guys don't seem to be able to keep staff or standards consistently. When we walked in, the young lady behind the counter just looked at us and didn't say a word. She just continued shuffling bagels from one spot in the display case to another. After a couple of minutes, the only young man there, finished texting on his cell phone and came over to ask what we wanted. The food was not bad, just average for any Einstein location and our order was correct. The restaurant itself was in bad need of cleaning, despite there being only four customers there in addition to us. There were dirty tables, dirty floors and when I went to the restroom, I wanted to puke it was so disgusting. I think we are done here. (See Photos)"}
{"text":"Apparently, this place is one of my Mom's go-to's for breakfast and brunch. We stopped by Sunday morning (despite listed business hours), and OMG were they good! We each had one of their \"everything bagels.\" Mine  was toasted with cream cheese and crispy bacon, while my mom opted in for their egg, tomato, and cheese specialties. Additionally, I had the pleasure of drinking the yummiest vanilla hazelnut iced coffees EVER!! Perhaps I caught them on a good day, but I can't wait to try out one of their locations near me."}
{"text":"This place is a disaster. Wait time is ridiculous. Very disorganized in the morning unlike other Einstein's they lack organization. It's not a quick in and out in the morning"}
{"text":"My Daughter stopped at Einsteins this morning and bought 3 bagels - usually they are great but this morning they are AWFUL - she asked for toasted and they either ignored that request or they have the worst toaster ever. Called to complain and their phone just rang and rang...no answer, no voicemail.  UGH waste of money and still hungry. How hard is it to actually toast a bagel and spread cream cheese -- if I could give negative stars I would."}
{"text":"They messed up my bacon egg cheese bagel and gave me a sausage egg and cheese bagel. They flipped the cooked egg in the plastic container on to the plastic table the place where all the other food Is prepared. That added a Some new taste."}
{"text":"I'm beginning to think Einstein's directs their franchisees to be as skimpy as possible.  The photo menus showing their sandwiches have ample cream cheese, but when the sandwiches show up they never have the amount advertised and never cover the bagel.  When I asked for extra cream cheese they charged me over a dollar extra, claiming I was wrong, and actually the cream cheese wasn't spread right.  They were rude on top of it. Go elsewhere for your food."}
{"text":"Prompt service. Had the green chili bagel with smoked salmon schmear which was amazing!"}
{"text":"Do nothing entitled young employees says it all. Kid with expanded earlobes acts like I'm pestering him to take my order and tell me what sides I gave. Tatted girl on her phone by register grumbles \"he takes your money\" while barely looking at me. The register situation always trips me out whoever put that system in created giant in efficiency. I let the smaller girl with glasses and koolaid red die job know someone put ice in their coffee and it blew up all over the place. She looked at me like I was crazy and walked to where they give you your food and totally ignored me. I sat and ate my sandwich and nothing was done. This would explain the overall decline of this store since its opened. If these kids don't want to work there they should quit instead of wasting the companies money and disrespecting the brand by being dirty. Einstein's is paying you."}
{"text":"2 weeks in a row, I called on Friday and ordered 3 dozen (specific) bagels to be ready for me on Saturday morning at 6am. 

2 weeks in a row the phone call was pleasant and efficient and the bagel order was fresh, ready on time, and delicious. 

This is my new favorite Einstein."}
{"text":"Against my better judgement we went here for a bagel on Fourth of July morning, and the staff was great! Polite and talkative and very kind. If this continues, I might actually go there again!"}
{"text":"Even though my experience in November review wasn't great.  They are just so darn convenient to my house that I returned and my Lox sandwich has improved."}
{"text":"I am in retail management and am often appalled by the lack of customer service everywhere. Not today. I sat in this shop for almost two hours an was extremely impressed by everything. The staff was a well run team and they were all engaging with the guests. The food was served quickly and it was delicious. The coffee was constantly being remade and was also delicious. The place was clean and had a warm and pleasant atmosphere. Kudos to the folks who run this shop."}
{"text":"Every single time I come in the morning during the middle of the work week there is only one person handling the front. Meaning one person taking orders and the same one collecting payments. This causes an extreme wait time for someone who is in a hurry to get to work thinking they can grab a quick bagel and go. Not the case here. They've also let the line pile up and the workers just walked back and forth paying no attention to the consumers. About five minutes go by and finally someone decides to step up and assist the customers who've patiently been waiting for help in line. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"I love Einstein's! Always fresh and always fast. I usually have a cinnamon raisin bagel and strawberry banana smoothie. Kids order the cinnamon sugar with a strawberry banana smoothie. Husband loves their Sante Fe Turkey breakfast sandwich. This location is usually pretty busy but the seem to be quick with the orders."}
{"text":"Great and super helpful service gets this place an ok in my book.. I said no thanks to chips and they explained that i get them any way, kudos!"}
{"text":"This review is specifically for this location and NOT ALL Einstein's.  This particular store has the most piss-poor service and product!

Here are a couple examples:
Last week I ordered a salad to-go.  They made it \"fresh\", put it in a bag and I took it back to work.  Upon arriving back at work I realized they didn't include the bread that comes with it.  :(  When I started eating the salad it was a fresh layer of lettuce on top of a slimy-brown layer underneath.  Barf!

This morning I had to wait 20 minutes to get a toasted bagel and cream cheese to-go!!  There was this guy next to me that was fuming!  I guess he was waiting for an order that he had faxed in the night before and they still hadn't filled.

This place needs to have more people on staff and train them better.  Really, making bagels couldn't be that hard!

If you are in the area, go to the Einstein's on Thunderbird + 40th St., the manager there is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Just came from Einstein Bagels on Flamingo and 215 215 it is Bagel Monday $6 Bagels for 13 Unfortunately they had none. I stand corrected they had pumpernickel in the oven and a couple of spinach which are charged extra. No apology no information as to when they're going to have more, I'm just a little pissed off rt now."}
{"text":"I stop by this location at least once a month for a couple bakers dozens to go boxes.. at 8:30am they typically have several boxes ready to go and if they don't they have them ready by the time you get to the register.

I go for the popular flavors instead of picking my own, if you have favorites they will definitely let you pick.

I choose two cream cheese tubs .. strawberry, blueberry, garlic, garden, jalapeño, low fat and regular ..  they put knives and napkins in the box for you and you are on your way.

My office and the customers I deliver these two always enjoy them! 

Staff is efficient, plenty of parking and seating inside and on the patio."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service isn't. Weekend mornings are a nightmare here, also they frequently run out of things."}
{"text":"So, my appetite has been nill lately due to stress.  I'm eating, but only on an as need basis.  This morning, I woke up hungry, and decided it was time to leave the house to get something to eat, and take the job search out of the apartment to a new location to keep it fresh.

Mind you, I've been to Einstein's and this location before. Overall, I find that Einstein's is kind of the McDonald's of bagels. Yes, they have a wide selection of pastries, sandwiches, coffee and plenty of other foods, but I'm not impresed overall with their stuff.  I don't think its awful, but I feel like it's become less home made tasting and more food for the masses.

This location itself isn't half bad. It's usually at least half full every time I come here. Sometimes it's clean, and sometimes, well, its not.  This morning the tables were clean, but I noticed a lot of stains in the beverage area, as if it hadn't been cleaned in a few hours. Noticeable rings and stains from cups and spills in that area, which kind of said no one was really paying attention to wiping it down.  

Other times I have noticed tables needing to be cleaned, with crumbs and stains from previous diners there. It's not aweful, but sometimes I feel like the staff here isn't in a rush to do anything, especially clean! I'm not saying this place is a dirty hole, but it doesn't always seem in tip top shape!

One time I came here last summer and their internet was down. I really needed to get online, and was desperate to connect. I asked the counter girl when their internet was going to be back up and running, and they told me sometime in the next week?

Staff is okay, not crude but not out going either. Please gets the job done, and serves its purpose.  I wish they would step up their food and service game and try a little harder!"}
{"text":"I admit, I lack excitement in my lunch hour.  If I eat lunch at all, its usually something quick, and boring.  Say hello to Einstiens.

Mind you, I have been to this location many times before.  Its located within the Hyatt Regency Hotel, and has street access to get in and out of.  No need to be a hotel guest just to dine here!

Anyways, the food at this location is the same as the others, but they tend to do more of a business/traveler crowd then the usual saturday morning crowds at a stand alone einsteins.

the food here is Okay.  Consistant, bland, and over priced.  They have a decent variety of bagels, cream cheeses, sandwiches and the like, but nothing memorable.  I usually go with some variety of a bagel and cream cheese...and tend to stay away from their overpriced sandwiches.

I find that Einstiens is okay, at best.  I usually end up here becuase its convienient."}
{"text":"I love a good bagel and cream cheese, especially on a Saturday Morning.  Mind you, I have been here several times before, so its not my first time.

The benefits of Einsteins is that they make all their tasty bagels in site. Flavors are tasty, with Asiago cheese, onion, garlic, and a few other flavors as well.  Great selection of different flavors of bagels.  They also have a few different options in cream cheese flavors as well.

They also have a great selection of lunch sandwiches, which I like.  Great selection pastries, juices, etc.

Where they loose points with me, is I don't care for the service here.  I always always always have to stand in line and wait; not only to place my order, but to pay and recieve my food as well.  Some could argue that maybe I am being fussy.  Others could say that I need to be more patient at times.  I do not argue that point. BUT, nothing irks me more then waiting...and waiting....and more waiting.

I have never NOT had to step in line here, regardless of time of day.  Why is that? I don't understand.

Also, I feel that service here lacks.  I always see multiple staff members behind the counter.  If thats the case, why is it always the same 1 person taking orders, and one working the register?  I also sense that maybe other customers get frustrated with this experience as well.  I go here becuase they do have great bagels, and their stuff is tasty...but at the cost of waiting....and iffy service.

Plus, sometimes this place is NOT super clean.  Its not filthy or anything..but I just feel like maybe it could use a good cleaning at times."}
{"text":"I stopped in here yesterday for a quick bite to eat.  I was surprised at how many people were here on a Thursday morning!  Quite a line.

I got a bagel with cream cheese, and it was yummy.  I had a very positive experience here considering it was Einsteins!"}
{"text":"In the mornings, I like to stop off and get myself some coffee and a treat of some sort before I roll into work.  I stop here because its close to work.

I can't say that I'm really a fan of Einstein's...they lack in so many areas, but I continue to go because I guess their just there, and its easy to stop in.

I'm not all impressed with this location.  The service is slow, their coffee bar area is slow to be restocked and half the time I have to ask for refills on coffee creamer, and other times its just long lines at like 7 am due to the slow service.  Plus, their bagels are not all that great to begin with.  I usually stick with the muffins myself, since they are usually pretty good, and the prices are A-okay.

Overall, its not that bad of a place, but Einstein's has become rather bland and boring over the years, leaving me desperate for better service, better bagels and a mostly generic feel.  blah.  I will say, at least this location has a decent amount of seating!"}
{"text":"I stop here once a week in the morning (usually around 6:30-7:00am) and have always gotten fresh bagels, cream cheese and pastries. The service is always excellent, there is ample parking and the wait is usually 3-5 minutes at the most."}
{"text":"Saturday morning at 10:30am is the time to go!! All the guys working this morning shift have the most positive and fun yet professional vibes. I will be here every Saturday morning if the same people are working. Fast, efficient, fun, morning vibes here."}
{"text":"What a terrible way to start the morning! This was our first time at and Einstein Bagel and our order was not a single bagel order either. We ordered a dozen and all we got was attitude! We even got robbed out of a bagel we wanted just because the guys behind the line didn't have all their bagels in order!!! :( The lady taking our order didn't even ask if we wanted to have all our bagels sliced she asked \"if we wanted anything done to them?\" Which we thought meant toasted or not? After all it was our FIRST TIME!  We also didn't realize they were not sliced so hence, NEVER ASSUME clients know how your business runs! Work as a team don't snap at each other!"}
{"text":"Pretty good bagels and coffee, etc.  Wish they had gluten free bagels though.  When I need to feed a crew of people a nice breakfasty snack it's easy to come in and get one of their large containers of assorted bagels."}
{"text":"Took a while for my sandwich, it was barely even Luke warm. As I ate it, the table next to mine had so much steam coming out of his. My cheese was not even melted, oh well. I should have returned it, but didn't know what to expect. It is fast good. I did like the oj tho, but that's all."}
{"text":"A great road stop. 
consistent and tasty.
Coffee isn't too bad, though these are often situated next to (or within walking distance from) McDonalds.. er.. I mean Starbucks."}
{"text":"I love coming here. Great place for coffee. I've tried plenty of the bagels but my favorite so far is the cinnamon sugar with honey almond spread. Game. Over. The breakfast sandwich was also really good! Definitely recommend this spot. :)."}
{"text":"Awful customer service.  The persons behind the counter made a mistake needed a refund.  Calls over the manager to refund and start over, he literally looked at me like I'm the problem.  Will not be back, ended getting only 1/3 of my order because the person ringing me up was more interested in singing a song than good customer service.  Never said hi, never asked what I might have didn't even look up at me when I got to the counter.  And then was standing where she was and looks up and points to where she want me to stand.  Awful."}
{"text":"I stopped at this location before a long drive to pick up some bagels for my kids.  I mentioned to Cassie that I had a 2 Hour drive ahead of me and she was such a sweetheart she went in the back and grab me a bag of ice for my cream cheese. It's the little things when people go above and beyond that make your experience that much better. I sure do love this!"}
{"text":"OK, it's an Einstein's - enough said. Great coffee, good bagels, lousy service. You know the drill."}
{"text":"I kept hearing how amazing this place was. It was mostly clean and the staff efficient (though I wouldn't call them friendly). 

I ordered a pretzel bagel with salmon shmere, because, Damn that sounds yummy, right? What I got was so salty that it actually burned my mouth. No flavor, just SALT. Plus, I made the mistake of reading what was in the shmere. MSG. Yup. So-called gourmet and they're trying to poison me. 

The guy was kind enough to exchange the salt fest for a different bagel with plain non-MSG laden cream cheese. So, they get a couple of stars. The chai latte was super, so they get another star. But, they add cheap poisonous flavor enhancer to thier \"gourmet\" food, so they don't get a customer."}
{"text":"Love the mushroom Swiss and spinach on everything.  Usually crowded. Customer service is typically good. Lots of bagel options. Price is kinda high."}
{"text":"Wow. You're a bagel shop meaning you're up at o'dark 30 and it would be nice if any of you would say good morning or even help. But nothing. I realize it's early but this is your job. You should be awake and happy to be working. If it's that's bad then find another job. And Qunisha... You seem really annoyed by me the customer. No hello, no good morning. Just my total due and change. Thanks for starting my morning so positively...NOT.  I will never be back to this store. Let's hope the others make customers feel welcome so early in the morning because again...that's the job you signed up for."}
{"text":"get the spinach florentine bagel with jalopeno cream cheese! very yummy!"}
{"text":"This Einstein's has two things going for it.... The Einsteins name and the awesome location in CenPho. Other than that they are majorly lacking!

As this location is on my way to work and I on several occasions have needed to stop to get breakfast for the office or just myself, I have been here often. 90% of the time I leave very aggrivated. It seems they have a high rate of turn over with their staff, as I rarely see the same face behind the counter, with the exception of a few. And most of them seem to still be in training mode, since none of them seem to know what they are doing.

I have been given the wrong order more than once. 

Left standing in line waiting to give my order to ANYONE while they all run around back there trying to make sense of the order on their screen.

I have waited upwards of 10 minutes for my order.

They have zero sense of urgency, when it is very clear that everyone in line are business people and need to get onthe road to work. 

I really hope that they can get it together soon, this is a very conveinent location and I am sure they can double their business is they were more productive with their time and training their empoyees better. Even if they are busy and behind just a simle smile and \"I will be right with you.\" would go a long way!"}
{"text":"Better visit than other Einsteins in town. Fresh food, hot drink, and my cashier Evan was very polite."}
{"text":"As far as bagels go Einstein's makes some good ones! You just cannot beat a bagel bucket with your favorite cream cheese. 

The first thing you notice when you walk into Einsten's is the wonderful smell of freshly baked bagels. Once inside you are warmly greeted by the staff and a grand assortment of bagels to choose from. You can make a sandwich of just about any kind, or you can get a bunch of bagels and some cream cheese to go. There are plenty of other options, but those are my go to. My favorite bagels consist of the asiago cheese, chocolate chip, sesame seed, everything, and sun dried tomato. All of the cream cheeses are delicious as well. Along with food they also have coffees and a variety of drink options. Einsten's is the perfect place to go treat yourself after a weekend morning workout (my usual time). 

While the inside provides a decent place to sit down and enjoy your meal it isn't that comfortable, so I suggest just taking your goodies to go. Hopefully you got enough to take and share with people anyway!"}
{"text":"I love Einstein's but this location was busy at 9am and didn't have half  of their options available and when asked when they would put bagels out they  said half an hour.  I don't understand why at such a busy hour they weren't at all prepared nor apologetic.  I'll be back but it was a disappointing experience"}
{"text":"I chose to eat here around lunch time after buying an overpriced salad that was glorified lettuce with chickpeas sprinkled on top. Disappointed and still decently hungry I ventured over to the Einstein's that was across the terminal. The line was long so I sat and waited. I got to see how efficiently they moved through the never ending line, and saw the reasonably priced lox bagel ($9.50, not bad, especially for airport prices!) and was sold. Service wasn't out of this world amazing, but gosh they're an insanely busy kiosk-esq place in the airport, I was impressed with the turn around time. From standing in line to receiving my meal it was around 5-7 minutes. The bagel was great, exactly what I wanted and, most importantly to me at the time, filling! They get extra points for it being tasty as well. 

The drink station next to it was clean, orderly and coffees were monitored/filled regularly. Next time I'm in this airport I'm going to save my pallet (and my wallet) the heartache of yet another bad airport salad and come directly to this vendor!"}
{"text":"Came from out of town and looked for a place that would be open the morning of the 4th of July. Place was packed, but they had the A-team working. Got our bagels and coffee quick and out the door in time to have a great holiday. 

Usually holiday crews aren't very good, but from bagel-builder to cashier all employees handled the rush very well despite having to work on such a fun day. Makes our Chicago stores look bad!"}
{"text":"I love their bagels. I am a big fan of Nova Lox. When I get the coupons in the mail I go a little coo-koo and order enough stuff for a month.

The last time I was at this location though, I was sorely disappointed. I was the first customer in door and not greeted with a, \"Hi, how are you?\". The lady behind the counter looked less than thrilled that I had bothered her at this hour. I asked for the 13 thin bagels and she said, \"I can do maybe some of them thin, but not all because I have to do them by hand.\" 

What?? I'm sorry. Since when did companies give their employees the right to be lazy. This was seriously a moment where I wanted to step back and tell her, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. I instead said all right 8 thin. I do not want to be a mean customer, but I came here to get something that is advertised by your company. I should not be leaving without it. She definitely needs to find a new line of work. As an employer, I know this attitude is not acceptable."}
{"text":"Great customer service. We came in at 9:30 on a Monday and they still had plenty of options for bagels. Definitely worth the extra bit of time it took to get here. The cashier, Tina, was even nice enough to let me know about the discount on schmears today and interacted with my three small children."}
{"text":"Got my order pretty fast and all the employees were friendly. Came in at lunch time and even though there were about 10 people in line ahead of me it all moved pretty quickly. After I ordered it was about 5 minutes to pay and get my food. I'll for sure go back to this place."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best bagel place in the state of Arizona! I had a crave for bagel this morning and I couldn't think of anywhere else. The service is superior and also very quick! I bought the turkey, egg and cheddar cheese on the six cheese bagel and I'm in heaven."}
{"text":"If you're name has bagel in it take the time to.put out a good dish.  Thickly cut  onion and tomatoes over power the Smoked salmon,  so when my wife says how can you mess up a bagel, ,no passion in preparation is how."}
{"text":"Horrible customer services. They get my orders wrong every single time. Coffee is either out either out or cold. This place will not last if the owner does not step in and take control."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Wendy and her crew are a well oiled machine. They are on point and move a lot of very happy customers through with amazing efficiency. Well done. Love to see a well run operation. Food is delicious too."}
{"text":"Decided to come to Einstein's because it was close to the house and I was given a gift card from a student. Big mistake! Customer service was non existent. Not one employee said hi, good morning, what would you like, or thank you. In fact, they all had a look of sheer panic that people would want a bagel on a Sunday morning or they were hungover. We took our bagels to go only to find there a thing spread of cream cheese. I don't think they could have made it any thiner. In fact, we barely even tasted cream cheese at all. I would like to thank Einstein's and their employee for providing me with the affirmation as to why I don't go there. The only reason I gave it one star is because I had a gift card. If you want a good bagel with good customer service, go to Big City Bagels. They are a locally owed business that takes pride in their product and customer service."}
{"text":"I like Einstein. But they didn't even toast my bagel when it was supposed to be toasted. 
I got the nova lox, and it's just looks sad lol
Cold and only like 2 pieces of salmon 
Darn. Maybe next time"}
{"text":"Rather disappointed in this location.  The soda machine was out of ice and was not filled after I told them about it, and they did not have any of the vanilla flavoring powder to be able to add vanilla to your iced coffee but the worst thing was the amount of cream cheese on my bagel was barely noticeable, it was like they wer spreading butter onmy bagel instead of cream cheese.  Sorry but when I order a bagel with cream cheese I expect there to be cream cheese on it. Other than that it is just your typical corporate Einsteins."}
{"text":"Typical corporate Einstein's.  Service was average.  Quality was about the same as every other Einstein's I've been too.  Nice patio area outside and located next to a Trader Joes for grocery shopping ease."}
{"text":"The bagels are awesome I recommend stopping in for lunch the people are nice"}
{"text":"If you wanna wait 45 minutes for one bagel come to this location. After 45 minutes when your bagel comes it will be burnt and only half covered in cream cheese. Then you'll eat your bagel on a dirty table. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Bagels are very good but service table needs to be stocked on a regular basis. There was no milk today for coffee ( all out of 2%, of fat free & of half & half). This happens on a regular basis there. Is not acceptable concerning this happens in morning when business is booming; someone should check regularly."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for 3 Asiago cheese bagels (not toasted, not sliced, nothing) just throw them in a bag a let's go. Then the ran out of the \"shmear\" and small containers, mind u it was around 11:00..no rush hour and no one else in line. The clerk who took my order obviously didn't want to be there and the older gentleman would get 1 bagel at a time and then start a conversation w/ another employee and then back to getting the 2nd bagel..repeat scene for the 3rd bagel. 
When I got home 1 bagel wS not the one I actually paid for..very frustrating..no apologies, nothing. 
A solicitor was also sat up outside and pounding people for donations for a charity. Seems like every weekend there outside...argh!"}
{"text":"One of my vices is a bagel with cream cheese and an ice coffee. That's why I love Einstein's! They have a great deal for $3.99 a bagel with a smear of your choice and a coffee. 

Einstein's has soooo many different bagels it's hard to pick just one sometimes. Some of my favorites are the Pumpernickel bagel, Pretzel bagel and the Garlic bagel. I really enjoy their Garlic and Herb smear. It's reduced fat, but you would never know. If your feeling adventurous i'd suggest the Garlic bagel with a Salmon smear! Yum! If you have a little extra cash I like to indulge in the Nova Lox bagel. It has capers, tomato, thin slices of red onion, lox and a smear. 

As far as drinks go I always get a regular ice coffee. It has unlimited refills! Yay!

Even though they get busy at times the staff is friendly and always do their best to help you. 

If your craving a bagel and your in the area hit up Einstein's. They even have breakfast and lunch bagel sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Excellent service: fast and friendly. The later crew seems to be more on top their game. I always get great service with a smile - even though you know they've probably been up longer than we all have. Some of the kids are better than others, that's why like to go later - better service. Some of their marketing strategies and pre-packaging could improve. My orders are always right and coffee is always hot! Overall, no complaints here. I do think some of the morning staff could use more training - I get better service later. Maybe that's where some of the negative reviews come in? Food for thought!"}
{"text":"Almost no selection of bagels. Slow. And extremely disorganized. I'll stick to Brooklyn Bagels."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying I created this account specifically for this review . that is how displeased I was with my most recent customer service experience at this particular location . I have always enjoyed breakfast here on my off days because it is on the corner of my home , however the young lady and the gentleman ( obvious  a new employee ) were horrible this afternoon.


I actually had an amazing morning and decided to stop by my favorite shop for breakfast . When entering I was never greeted even though I was one of 2 customers (which has never happened, I always receive a warm greeting) I actually didn't let it detour me because I was in such a Good mood . however , the employees were not ! The young lady was training and she made it well known by pointing out every little thing the young man did wrong in front of the customers and with a horrible attitude at that. NOT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO BE A LEADER. Poor young man was so soft spoken when asking him to speak up because I can hardly hear he snapped with a quick question back at me . The young lady made me feel so un welcome and as if I bothered her with questions of a new sand which I was trying this time .

I would have to say I  am truly disappointed in This experience and the tempo and atmosphere of there afternoon workers should seriously be looked into ."}
{"text":"A TERRIBLE Einstein Bagels. Rude workers, stale bagels and dirty shop. Really there is nothing nice to say about this place. The Indian woman behind the register is one of the rudest. Never smiles, rolls her eyes and has snide comments. I will say this, they are consistent on all of the above. It really is a shame given that Einstein Bagels was once considered a great chain."}
{"text":"I got a coupon for my birthday for a free breakfast sandwich with purchase of drink so I thought my day was off to a great start. I called ahead on my way into work. An iced coffee is $4 and way too sweet. Waste of money! It's $2 at Starbucks and way better. There was one cashier on a Saturday morning with 15 ppl in line! What's the point of calling ahead if I have to wait 15 minutes and then run late for work?!:( They need to have a fast cashier that knows what they are doing at peak times!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. I always get: turkey, sausage and egg on a bagel and it's the perfect breakfast meal! I also love going in on Mondays for their 13 bagels for only $6. Amazing deal and their bagels are always freshly made and taste great."}
{"text":"Great bagels and shmear! Busy sometimes but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Bagel heaven is the Good Grains w the Jalapeño Salsa lightly toated. The service is over the top here, I probably could have had my car valeted & washed while eating!

Second time eating here was different, Ruben showed me how wrong I was in my review about there service by being rude to my father on his order."}
{"text":"Service: excellent - prompt and courteous. 
Food: as excellent as it gets on a bagel 
Eating area: good - it could use more table cleaning tho. I had to wipe my table before sitting down."}
{"text":"Best bagels and cream cheese I've ever had! I love when the cream cheese is light and fluffy. It tastes a lot better and makes it easier to apply! Their bagels are light and fluffy and absolutely delicious too! Its a definite treat when I get to have Einsteins bagels :)"}
{"text":"First, let me start by saying that Einstein Bros Bagels is my favorite coffee/breakfast stop! I visited this location for the very first time because it's convenient and close to my house. But... The service was very slow and lacked experience. I was there with a friend and our food came out way before she made it to the register to pay, and she still had to wait almost 10 min for our drinks! Needless to say, our food was cold by the time our drinks were ready. They were having problems with the coffee machines and even the manager had no clue of what was wrong. I think this whole store, including the manager (who was from the 215/Flamingo store) needs some more extensive training. Conveniently located but would rather drive further for better service."}
{"text":"the bagels are okay. maybe even 4 stars. i don't give it more stars for a few reasons. a few times they acted put out when i requested the more fragrant bagels to be separated from the rest (everything, garlic, onion). i would think they would get why and be good with the request.
 in a weird increasing frequency, the bagels have been sliced poorly. at first i thought it was my imagination or maybe the slicer went dull. it is to the extent that my child likes to peer in the bag or box to see what the slicing surprise will be. if i purchase a dozen, at least 6 will be only half sliced. sometimes they are sliced where the top is sliced off, not near the center of the bagel, rather like scraping the topping off."}
{"text":"Always a great quick stop if you're looking for coffee or bagels. While I'm love a classic plain with cream cheese, one of my favorite newer additions to the menu is the farmhouse breakfast sandwich. Perfect for those days I can't decide between an egg sandwich and a cream cheese bagel. Service is always fast and super friendly. The manager working 5/6 around noon was so nice!"}
{"text":"Service is quick, not much to complain about. However, the wifi is weak, so if you're a student, look elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. The food was fine but I was surprised by the way the employees were loudly conversing at the register and throwing ice cubes... just obnoxious."}
{"text":"Ordered their Nova Lax sandwich. Great portion sizes. Biting thru my second piece of bagel I got a mouthful of crispy bacon. 
That destroyed my lunch experience. 
Poor service as I was handed my sandwich no guidance on condiments or napkins. Nothing. Nadal."}
{"text":"So I've been craving a cinnamon sugar bagel went to this location around 12 noon they had ran out of plain and cinnamon sugar which I believe they are open until 5pm so not sure why they wouldn't make more. A week later I call to make sure they had what I wanted before I got there. Big disappointment, the staff didn't even greet us he seriously looked bored and like he just hated being there. I had to approach him with a good morning. I bought a half dz, I really wanted my cinnamon sugar so I bought them even though they looked horrible. Big regret so disappointed. Bagels are suppose to be nice and round with a hole in the middle. What the heck are these?! Never going back. Customers have expectation and not even high ones but as a business you're suppose to make sure you meet them."}
{"text":"I have been here several times over the past few months and i kid you not...every single time i have said \"I need to just write a review of yelp\" because every single time they have gotten my order wrong. Their customer service is terrible, half the time the person at the register doesnt speak the same language as me, and again...they always mess up my order. 

The obvious question is \"why then do you continue to go back?\" 
ahh its those darn coupons in the mail for two dollar tuesday and free bagel friday that rope me in. Usually i leave feeling like a fool for falling for it once again. Rest assured its bound to happen again."}
{"text":"One star is too many for this location
 I went to have lunch and waited until the employee finished cleaning the floor. He came to take my order without washing his hands or putting gloves.

{"text":"I love Einstein bagels, but this location is really slacking!  I have been in here a total of 2 times, and both times they seem really under staffed.  I went here on a Thursday and they had one person cooking, one person taking order and running to the other end to cash people out. There was a line out the door, the coffee was empty, and the half and half was empty.  I don't know how they plan on functioning with two people at the busies time in the morning."}
{"text":"I like the food here and the proximity to my home. It also offers outdoor seating however the past 2 visits here leave a lot to be desired. Got overcharged both times for stuff I didn't order. Pay attention to your order because in my experience it gets entered into the register wrong. Today's visit was the same on top of losing my order. The food preparer was very apologetic which means at least they care. I do not recommend coming here if you are in a hurry as it will just increase your anxiety. Be sure to help walk your order to the end. I will keep coming back though. Hopefully they can build a great team here and get everyone trained. Be very patient! :-)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to check this place out because we had some buy 1 get 1 free coupons for sandwiches and drinks.

I had the veg out bagel sandwich; despite disliking anything with sun-dried tomatoes I actually thought it was pretty darn good.  The bagel was untoasted, which was the only thing that I disliked (aside from the small size)--bagels are one of those foods that needs to be heated up...seriously...who eats untoasted bagels?

Anyway, it was a pretty good sandwich but way too ridiculously expensive for the tiny size.  Wouldn't have been worth it at all if not for the coupon we had.  $7 for a small bagel with \"schmear\" (ughhh that word gives me the willies), some sprouts and a few veggies?  Seriously?  My boyfriend ordered a panini, also ridiculously small, with potato salad on the side, for $8.  The potato salad was pretty nasty--he couldn't even finish it.

We also had iced coffee, which is probably the only thing I'll get from here in the future.  I dunno, maybe I'll get a bagel or something if I have a coupon but overall I felt like the prices just didn't make sense for the amount of food you get.  You can go to a nice local place and get larger servings of better food for the same price.

They do have a parking lot, which is a plus, and the seating and atmosphere is nice.  Probably would be a decent place to grab a coffee and do some homework but I wouldn't really bother with their food."}
{"text":"This location is very hit or miss. I've been here a few times and the bagels were great and toasted perfectly. I have also been here more than once where my bagel was burnt and had wayyyy too much cream cheese or shmear as they call it. The service is usually on the slow side even when they aren't that busy. However, I do enjoy the bagels as they are delicious but sometimes I just worry if it's gonna be burnt or not."}
{"text":"As always AC running because staff is hot. Meanwhile can't sit in the inside as it feels like the refrigerated section at Winco. Selection? Yeah they're picking bagels off sheets, baskets empty. Coffee and cream empty yet again. Why is this the worst EB? NO WAY you people don't read about this lousy location. FIX IT please!"}
{"text":"Not really a fan of Einstein Bagels as it is just average food at above average prices. However, I have to give it to them on the Pretzel Bagel as it is delicious and goes perfectly with a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich.

Additionally, the staff at this location seems to be different every time I'm here. Not sure if it is high turnover or coincidence. Service has room for improvement. 

The PB&J bagel is interesting as well.....a bit difficult to eat as a bagel and doesn't really go with anything but is flavorful on it's own. Probably better off just eating PB&J on a regular bagel honestly."}
{"text":"One star is too many.  Waited almost 25 minutes for 2 toasted bagels with butter.  Don't know what took so long, as there were only 2 people in front of us.  The most unorganized place I've ever seen.  There were maybe 6 types of bagels left and the other baskets were all empty.  Pathetic looking.  The guy who took the order acted like he was doing us a big favor.  I was so pissed off waiting that long, it was unbelievable.  I could have sat down to a full course dinner in less time than that.  BUT the worst part of all, if it can get any worse, was how filthy the place was.  Check out my photo.  That was just behind the counter.  The rest wasn't much better.  Incompetent, slow, filthy, unorganized and unfriendly are just a few of the adjectives that come to mind.  Stay clear!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came in on a Monday morning shortly after opening.  They were already busy and the two counter employees were buzzing around at ludicrous speed to make up for someone calling out that morning.  They were still able to quickly take my order and get me out the door without any feeling of being rushed, all with a level of cheer rarely seen before 6AM.  

Tip, they run a special on Mondays of 13 bagels for six bucks.  Perfect to grab and take back to the family as they come out of hibernation."}
{"text":"I gave my order and was told why i should not change a bagel sandwich. My sandwich was good. My food was tossed in a bag as if I wouldn't like to sit and eat it. Maybe I was just not welcome.  The iced coffee was like water. I asked about a stronger cup and was given excuses. Save your money on the coffee. Try the sandwich if you like attitude at 8am."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. The line was 10 deep and employees were moping around like they hated life."}
{"text":"I'm an Einstein's lover.  I have been for awhile and there's just nothing I can do to change it. Chompies probably has better bagels and I could most likely get a less expensive sandwich somewhere else, but guess what? I don't want to.

They have this bagel sandwich called 'veg-out' that I always get. I'm addicted to it.  I think it's the feta pine nut spread. It's like crack.

They also have breakfast sandwiches, paninis and extremely delicious cookies."}
{"text":"Been there every morning recently. Price can be a little high for a $3 bagel with cream cheese. But the large variety available definitely pays off. Tried different choices. Favorite was still blueberry bagel w/ blueberry cream cheese that I got during my first visit. If you haven't tried Nova Lox you should try it. I like to make the analogy of making an inside-out sushi but it was surprisingly good anyway. Sandwiches are a little over prized, but definitely hot and fresh. And a good breakfast starts a good day!

Staff are friendly. Normally doesn't run out of space for eating in. I stopped going as frequently as I knew that bagels aren't as healthy as I thought they were. But I still strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"If I could give this location no stars I would. When I entered there was a line of maybe 10 people. The girl behind the counter with the long brown hair and arm tattoos was openly screaming at the customers. She was yelling that if they were getting single orders they needed to come to her if they were ordering a dozen or more they needed to stay there, she kept screaming different directions over and over and the getting  passive aggressive and sarcastically says \"well if anyone is listening to me they can come over and order!\" In a snotty tone.  Then when people approach her she would say \"as I already said five times you need to order on the other side!\" I informed her she was very rude, I also asked for her name so she could be reported properly and she refused to give it to me. I let her know I would be contacting the corporate office and she let me know \"I don't care.\"  I watched no less then 10 customers all ordering 12 bagels or more leave the store. I've been a service manager for 15 years, I would never have that girl in any position in any department. She does not have the personality or patience to be customer facing."}
{"text":"After three years of avoiding this Einsteins location I decided to try again...I was hoping the management had changed and maybe it would be cleaner and better run than my last visit to this location (over 3 years ago). I WAS WRONG! Rude staff, filthy dinning room, and still out of common bagels early on a Sunday?!? I ordered a toasted onion bagel with salmon cream cheese, usually with Einsteins I find myself scraping off the cream cheese as they at very generous with the how much they give, today i barely had any on my bagel and they tried to up-charge me when I asked for more. And this after waiting almost 15 min to get my bagel. 

Shame on me for trying again."}
{"text":"I love this place. The place is really nice and clean. The employees are kind, helpful, and fast. The bagels are amazing. They are toasted perfectly and they have a countless variety of bagels. Everything about this place is awesome."}
{"text":"This place is fairly expensive as all their items cost +$8.00. The price is high because they take away the element of choice by forcing you to buy a side with every order. That amount of money should be the normal amount for a meal so the drinks have to be bought separately. 

With that said, their food is of high quantity in comparison to many other restaurant establishments. Out of the myriad of panini places I've eaten at, this is one of the few places where the panini actually makes me full. It's just a darn shame that quality was most definitely sacrificed for quantity."}
{"text":"The bagels are always really good. Perfect doughy-ness. Always fresh. This visit I had the Lox and Bagel... and typically it's raw salmon slices, but I don't know how I ordered it differently but the salmon was cooked this time, which I normally wouldn't mind... but it was a bit fishy. The slather of cream cheese was generous... and that's what probably made it's saturated fat content super high. Oh well... 

The place was decently clean and staff decently nice."}
{"text":"Gave this place a second shot after after Sunday nightmare ad mouthy staff.  Sunday just asked for a simple order and if can't be done on a different bread then communicate nicely. This morning same kid working too busy talking with his coworker. 3 people in the store and 15 min for a bagel lightly toasted and cream cheese. Absolutely no work ethic or customer service. He needs a new job and a name tag so we could post bad employees and management could address. This is absolutely sad and would rather drive to buffalo and lake Meade  for service."}
{"text":"Standard airport Einstein's. Got a cheese pizza bagel on asiago bagel.  Pizza was pretty cooked and crunchy, maybe 15 seconds too long in the oven."}
{"text":"Good Service, Good Bagels, Good Quality, Great Price!

My boyfriend brought me here to get breakfast twice. The bagels are super fresh and super tasty. Way better than the bagels I get at home, Bay Area, California. The bagels are fluffy and the cream cheese is so flavorful! The mornings can get busy, but still the food comes out quick and its delicious.

Not much to say, but I'll be coming back when I'm in Vegas. Though I just found out there is an Einstein Bros Bagels on my campus..."}
{"text":"Just watched 6 people, including me, walk out of here. It's Sunday at 1040 am and they had 3 people working and were out of several types of bagels. Terrible planning and bad customer service."}
{"text":"It was 6 am and I was hounding yelp to find out where I can get a great tasting with no added sugars cup of coffee. Something that wasn't Starbucks. One that wasn't 500+ calories a cup and for a reasonable price. And something to eat for breakfast, that would hold me over till lunch. I was starving and needed to be Downtown at jury duty by 8am.

Just my luck einsteins is open early! Woo hoo! I forgot that they were one of the few quick-breakfast food places open early, I really didn't want to go to McD's or Jack's. 1 star. 

So glad I was able to avoid McDonald's. When I stepped in, no line, score! 1 more star.

 I was greeted by the cashier. Smiling and a welcoming attitude. Another star.

The other worker, he seemed like he was just there for the paycheck.

 But the girl who helped me was more than helpful. I really appreciated that since I was only running on 2 hrs of sleep and on my way to jury duty at 6 am in the morning.

 I got a medium coffee and a bacon and spinach panini. I guess I didn't pay attention to the price of the sandwich because my total came out to $8. $5 Seems kinda pricey for a breakfast sandwich. But the panini was pretty big.  And that's what I get for not going to a fast food joint. The medium coffee was $3. I didn't finish the panini so I was able to eat for lunch too. So it wasn't too bad. 

I can't remember the last time I was at an Einstein's nor do I remember getting their coffee. So I was joyfully surprised to see that the coffee is self serve. I was happy to see that!!! 

I really liked the coffee! I don't like to add sugar to my coffee and just a couple squirts of half and half.  They have a couple different flavors of coffee to choose from too! 

I forgot what the name of the coffee was that I got. It was a very bold flavor. I really liked it! I love intense flavors. I've had their bagels, but not at this visit. They're delish. 

I'll be coming here again for my morning coffee when I'm out and about. :)"}
{"text":"I go here for breakfast and i usually end up with a sandwich.  All sandwiches here are great and filling with the side.  Breads are freshly baked right there.  I have had breakfast here and the bagel egg sandwiches are pretty darn good.  Can be kinda cramped inside with a full house on weekends but the service is so quick I'm usually on the road before someones rug rat starts bumping into me."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! I come here about once a week and order the same thing every week. I order the lox sandwich and a small coffee. This week, as soon as I placed my order it was ready, which was awesome! But the bagel was cold and not toasted, so I pointed it out and they remade it. When I got it back, the toppings were so sloppy and I gave a funny look at it because it was so unappealing to eat, and the lady said she just scraped everything onto a new bagel so she didn't have to throw out anything. Totally fine! Then as soon as it entered my hands I saw a long black hair weaved inside the cream cheese (definitely not my blonde hair that was pulled back in a tight bun), so I brought it back and told them I wouldn't eat it, didn't want it remade and that I would not be returning. The lady then mumbled \"we all have our hair back\" and SHE had her hair down! It was almost 3 inches longer than her shoulders! They were so rude and I was so appalled at this kind of service. She ended up giving us a refund, but was so salty about it and made it seem like it was our fault. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"One of the best places to get your bagel fix. They have some amazing and tasty combinations. The first time I went I had their Lox bagel on an everything bagel. It was the first time I'd had capers on a Lox bagel and it was superb. I've also had their egg and bacon, as well as their tuna with melted cheese on top! All were very delicious. The only thing I would suggest is too ask them to avoid adding too much salt on their sandwiches. Otherwise, this place is great."}
{"text":"This place was delicious and fast! Tracey was so incredibly helpful and sweet, amazing customer service from her as well as I believe he was manager at the first register. From Orange County and next time I will be back to this Einsteins for the customer service!"}
{"text":"there is something about this place i just love. the french toast and the cinnamon sugar bagels are so good they should be illegal. i could literally eat them every day and i would not get tired of them. great place to start the morning off."}
{"text":"LOVE Einstein Bros bagels! Their 6 cheese bagels are sooo delicious. I always get fast and courteous service when I stop at this location...even when they are busy! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've always preferred their bagels to any place else. They offer a wide variety of tasty flavors, although during certain times of the day they will be out of my favorites. This location's staff is hit or miss as far as positivity goes. It's usually fairly clean and their radio station caters to a large audience. My favorite part of this location is the large patio outside. I always sit out there when the weather permits it! As far as I know, the patio is dog friendly too!"}
{"text":"Terrible service at this location. I have consistently gone in, and Sean the shift leader is a complete jerk to customers and workers alike. When I got home and told me husband about my experience today, he asked, \"Is Sean the one with the longish hair? Yeah, I know who you are talking about. That guy sucks.\" I thought it was kind of funny my husband who has a terrible memory, remembers this kid by his awful service.

Today I went in, and asked if they had any more everything or cheese bagels, since the baskets were empty. Sean says he will check, huffs and walks away. He comes back and says no to the Everything, but they have the cheese bagel. I order a cheese bagel and a cinnamon raisin bagel, as a replacement for the everything. Not even fifteen seconds later, a girl walks out from the back with a pan of everything bagels. I immediately ask for them to switch the cinnamon bagel out for an everything since I was just told they were out, and Sean looks at me and says in a loud voice with the rudest attitude he could muster, \"I didn't SEE them behind the sesame bagels, okay?!\" I was very taken aback. He then asks if my bagels are to go and I say yes. To lighten the mood, I then said \"come on, do you really think I could eat two bagels? Ha ha\" and without smiling he looks me up and down with his eyes lingering on my stomach, and says \"I don't know.\" Implying that I look like I do!! I was so insulted by this. Everyone who works there looks so miserable, there are no smiles or \"hi, how are you today?\" The girl at the register snapped at a mom ahead of me, who looked shocked.
I looked on Yelp and saw all the negative reviews. I ended up calling the manager about ten minutes later to tell him how awful my experience was, in case he is unaware of how terrible his workers are. His reply was \"...okay? I will pull Sean aside and talk to him...\" But he really didn't seem to care. I will not be back, I will drive a little farther for an Einstein bagel, served with a smile."}
{"text":"Although the food is like any other Einstein, no one EVER acknowledges a customer there.... There is always a bunch of employees running back an forth, but you are just waiting at the counter to be helped and no one even makes eye contact and just keeps doing what they're doing... Very annoying!"}
{"text":"When the guys are making the food, I'd give this place 4stars (If the garbage was consistently clean I'd give them 5)  When the heavier manager lady is making the food, I'd give it 1 star.   I usually order the same thing:  Veg Out in a wrap, add avocado.   The guy is great. The lady though,  too much cream cheese, no tomato, and more wrap than anything else. Lettuce is NOT that expensive, spare an extra leaf will you?  What's the point of paying $7/$8 for a healthy wrap when there are no vegetables in it?  I'll do the $5 super stuffed chicken wrap or the $6 salad WITH vegetables next time she's making the food.     I had a nova lux when she was here before too and she completely cheapest out on ingredients.  If I want Nova lux I drive to the Einstein's off Tropicana before coming to school now."}
{"text":"Not good anymore. Their Pumpernickel Bagel is too salty to eat, if you have health condition, you cannot eat it.  Servers are very rude, store not clean"}
{"text":"The service here is bad, they do not clean 
tables & floors.  Not good anymore. Their Pumpernickel Bagel is too salty to eat, if you have health condition, you cannot eat it.  Servers are very rude, store not clean"}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place because it use to have amazing service but lately and especially today it was a disaster! Took twenty minute to toast and spead a bagel, employees arguing behind the counter, one girl with horrible body odor"}
{"text":"I waited 20 minutes for my asiago bagel and I was the only one in the dining area  but they forgot about it and burned my bagel. Service is terrible."}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly and fast. The bagels are super fresh.
Best Bagels in town. This place never disappoints.
I just wish they were open later on weekends ."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years. Good bagels, sandwiches and coffee. Nic check in this am by manager. Friendly. Fast service this am! Great!"}
{"text":"Poor service. Five staff members and Slow service. Made an order with nobody in front of me, staring at six-six cheese bagels, ordered one, waited 5 mins, then they told me they were out of six cheese. Unacceptable. I sat and watched and they ran out of two other kinds of bagels. Even worse, the messed up a regulars order!!"}
{"text":"Love the pre-made bagel boxes. Makes it quick to pick up for work. Just wish they had a little more variety sometimes. Sometimes the variety has been great but other times we've had only three different basic bagels to choose from."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the most disgusting place I've been in!! There is trash everywhere, no one has swept or wiped down the tables in the 30 minutes I've been here. The toilet hasn't been cleaned in a VERY long time (there's a mildew ring around it..). Floors are disgusting as well. Ew ew ew!! Won't be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Consistently bad. Employees don't care. Not attentive. Out of most bagels. Waited 10 minuets to even be acknowledged. Rude rude rude."}
{"text":"Will never be coming back again. Place is filthy. Employees suck. The girl at front burnt my bagel completely. It's not edible. And my top bun looks more like a chip since it's cut so thinly? Don't waste your money at this Einstein. I feel sorry for the owners of this joint because of their unqualified employees who clearly don't care."}
{"text":"This is a great bagel place.  I came in this morning and got a Southwest Churizo Sunrise sandwich and a iced Chai tea.  Wow!  The food, drink and service were on point.  This location is conveniently located by the Palms casino on Flamingo and Arville.  Very clean and friendly local too."}
{"text":"Don't come to Einsteins if you only have a $100 bill!! No customer service then the staff just snickered and laughed about it where am I again? Oh yeah, Vegas!! First time disappointed  ju"}
{"text":"OK, I admit it. I am an Einstein Bros. junkie, aka, a regular. I stop by 2-4 times a week, and have done so for the past 2 years. 

I am spoken to by name by the majority of employees, and all of them provide great hospitality. The employees here are outstanding and friendly, and I am paying attention to how they treat new customers. There is no drop off in the kindness they show to between regulars and first time visitors. In fact, my wife and three boys all love this place too, even though they don't know their names!

I have had breakfast and lunch here, and I have catered a breakfast using this location. The bagels are as close to a New York bagel that you can find in Chambana. The cream cheese flavors are excellent! (Try the smoked salmon on an asiago bagel!) 

If you were really pressing me to find something to gripe about it would be a minor item that I consider ultimately unimportant to the overall dining experience. That item is simply this. When I get coffee, the lids are on one side of the coffee bar and the cream and sweetener are on the other. Since I put the lid on last, I have to go back and get the lid, when I've got everything else ready to go. (I did mention it was an utterly unimportant non-issue, no?)

So, trust me. If you are looking for a trustworthy breakfast place, Einstein Bros is where its at. The real secret that not many people know about is how good they are at lunch. Try the soup. Try a Thintastic Chicken Pesto. 

And tell 'em Sean sent you, and see what happens!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised people hate this location so much. Maybe I just haven't experienced the same problems as everyone else. In fact, I've experienced the opposite: what I order is what I get and the staff is friendly and efficient. I've been especially impressed by the manager on duty on weekday mornings - he seems to keep things moving and pitches in wherever he's needed. 

I experienced a great example of this attentiveness a few weeks ago when I made a commitment to bring coffee into an 8am meeting but stupidly only left myself 15 minutes to stop and get it. I first went into Starbucks next door and was told it would take at least 15 minutes to get a carafe filled. I quickly ran next door to Einstein's to see if I would have better luck, and to my great relief, the on-duty manager saw that I was in a hurry and told me he'd \"get it done.\" About 6-7 minutes later, after true hustling, he gave me the full carafe and all of the cups, creamers, etc. 

Anyway, it's possible management has changed since a lot of these reviews because my experiences have really been pretty positive. 

P.S. Try the asparagus egg breakfast sandwich on the thin wheat bagel. It's a great vegetarian option. Just ask for light sauce."}
{"text":"My bagel as always was delicious. The service today, however, was sub par. The girl who took my order did not smile or even pretend that she was happy to be there. The girl who took my payment didn't greet me. She took my card, slid it, then answered a phone call and walked away. She did not offer me a receipt. Once my order was ready they called my name and I walked up to my box of food. They did not thank me or offer me a bag for my order. I grabbed my box and there was cream cheese all over the bottom of it. I am very disappointed in the service I received today."}
{"text":"Now we all know that you take a chance anytime u enter a restaurant...ugh.
I went in for a bagel & coffee.
The lady at counter...her name started with J and it was sat dec. 29 @ 145 pm . She looks african american. She was ringing a lady up and she wiped her nose with her hand ...you know ...like a kid does when they have a cold. Well then she proceeded to make sandwiches. Granted she put on the plastic gloves but the problem is the snot was on her hands.
No food for me ...Thanks.
Hey...staff and managers ...how would you like to be served by your co worker.
Just wanted to let people know.
Sorry...."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and pretty much ordered the same thing, I have to say it was fresh and pretty tasty!

I ordered the Spinach & Bacon Egg Panini (with turkey instead of bacon) and cinnamon bagel bites, the second time I tried the cinnamon bagel poppers (pretty much the same thing the poppers are just in a cup that's cleaner and easier to carry) ... Anyhow the panini was very good! Fresh, hot and a good mixture of ingredients. The only thing really bringing flavor to it though is the roasted tomato spread so if you don't want it tasting too bland ask for extra! 

The cinnamon treats were alright. Nothing special, but good if you want a sweet fix! I just wish they were kept warm, they would probably be way better!

I met the general manager the second time around and he was very nice! Actually taking orders for customers, which I always think is awesome of managers, that they help out too and not just bark orders. Also, both times I went around 12:30 and got in and out pretty fast! I only have 30 minutes for lunch and still had time to drive back to work and eat.

I didn't give this place 5 stars because the cinnamon bites we're just ok and random, but they don't put napkins in the to-go bags! I HATE when places do that, or rather DON'T do that! lol anywho...

Overall I'm a fan! Want to check this place out? I say give it a go!"}
{"text":"The turkey sausage and egg sandwich I had was pretty bland. It's a chain though so you kind of expect it. The eggs looked like rubber. I wouldn't try to go here, but the staff is nice so if you have to no big deal."}
{"text":"Simply the best. I ordered about 8 dozen bagels for a bagel drop and they went above and beyond to help me. From packaging to helping me load the car. Great customer service. Thank you for making it easy Einstein Bagels."}
{"text":"One if my fav breakfast place;) the service is good, love the selection of coffee;) must have the bagel melt, u will live it!!!!"}
{"text":"Not only was the cashier not knowledgeable, but she told me I wasn't able to have smear on an egg/cheese sandwich on a six cheese bagel. I ALWAYS ORDER THIS SAME BAGEL SANDWICH - egg & cheese w/ avocado and plain smear. THEN, to top it off, one of the women preparing the orders bypassed my food that I saw already toasted, sitting there & getting cold SEVEN times. I waited 17 minutes for a bagel sandwich and received not one apology. SO DISGUSTED."}
{"text":"Go to a different location. The girl that took my order didn't speak to me one time! She had headphones in while taking my order and didn't even ask if I wanted a receipt, she just walked away after I payed. Super rude"}
{"text":"Poor service. Poor organization. The wait was too long because they were not operating in a systematic process or doing anything like I have seen in order Einsteins. I had to go back in and wait in line to get napkins and knives for my bagel bucket, they weren't even helpful or acknowledge their mistake"}
{"text":"Service is always friendly. The food has always been good. It seems that they had a recent price increase and having to pay more than 10.00 for a bagel bucket seems unreasonable to me. They now cost 14.50 which means I will be going so ewhere else."}
{"text":"My coworker went here (the one in ASU Memorial Union)  for breakfast sometimes, so I decided to try it out too. I purchased a coffee and a brownie, the lady told me that she needed to check in the kitchen. Later on another guy came out and brought a brownie to me, he was telling to the lady that \"this is the last one from.......\" The lady disrupted him immediately and quickly took my credit card. When she was making the coffee for me, she was talking to another lady in Spanish in front of me, saying that the brownie was a left over one and the guy was talking loudly, and how he should have not do so in front a customer....The whole mumble brought me doubts to this place. I don't know what left over food they would give to me or any customer again."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, a bunch of unmotivated kids! Girl was making my coffee and went in the back and came back walked out front to  take her break I guess - if I didn't say something who knows when I would of gotten my coffee! Oh and a simple bagel toasted with butter - took forever - people who came in after me got their food before me. If I could give it 0 stars I would!"}
{"text":"Service here is AWFUL the girls working behind the counter were complete idiots when it came to answering any questions about the menu or even bringing out our food the way we ordered it. The coke machine was dispensing water and 2 of the coffee options were empty and when we notified them they didn't seem to care at all about the coke and made me fill up my coffee behind the counter. I can understand if the place was ram packed but it was dead. I highly suggest corporate coming in and getting some new staff. Snickerdoodle was bomb tho!!"}
{"text":"Good bagel and shmear, fast and friendly service.  Pretty typical Einstein, except it is connected to a Boston Market so it can get crowded at lunch time.  
Stopped by a couple of times recently and just don't understand why they cannot get the ice tea machine to make good ice tea.  It is just to bitter."}
{"text":"This was probably one of my worse bagel experiences and it takes a lot to mess up a bagel and lox order. We ordered six to go. Once the Oder was ready I looked in the bag and saw 12 foil wrapped half bagels. Everything was stacked up on the half bagels starting with all the ingredients under the lox! I asked the girl behind the counter what that was and she said they were out of boxes! She seemed surprised that I was concerned! Furthermore, the lox was dry and the tomatoes were old and practically non existent! No management to talk to ! This was at 9 in the morning."}
{"text":"This place has the worst coffee ever, and their mass produced and over priced bagels aren't much better. I spent $6 on a bagel, cream cheese, and a coffee. Nope, not worth it. Not at all. Especially since their coffee tastes like watered down crap."}
{"text":"Food is the same as any Einsteins but the service is terrible! I was there when the place was slow and even still nobody cared I was there. I ordered a bagel with lox, a side order of potato salad, and a fountain drink. After I paid the manager/cashier bailed without giving me the cup for my drink. I had to round her up to get that while she was washing tables. I went to get a drink while my food was being made and the ice machine was empty. I told an employee behind the counter about this and he shrugged and turned around without saying anything. My food came out and they forgot the potato salad. I went up and asked for it and the employee tossed it at me, said \"here ya go\" and never apologized. I ate and when I left I wanted a drink refill and it Still wasn't refilled with ice. 

The next time I want a bagel I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been coming to this Einsteins about 3x per week before work because he works on the road so it's easy to eat on the go, it's fairly quick and it's near our house. The employees seem to be consistent, even have the order down without telling them. Occasionally they have forgotten to put three eggs on the bagel and I don't notice until I'm eating on the road. However, the amount of homeless people that flock around this place is absolutely disgusting. They are inside begging for money (how is this even allowed). There is no enforcement to not have them sit on the patio that is allotted for guests. It just makes for a very unsanitary environment."}
{"text":"Located in Terminal 4 of Sky Harbor Airport (just outside of security before heading down escalator to baggage claim) is a convenient place to stop when you get off of that early a.m. flight and had not yet had a bite to eat. 

Bagels, spreads, breakfast and deli sandwiches. 

While the service wasn't slooow, the people who work there are definitely confused. I had to pay three separate times since they kept forgetting to ring items up. Bagel. Check. Special spread, oh I didn't get that. Check. Bottle of water, you wanted that too? Oh, now I ran out of dimes, I'll be right back (BTW, in case you didn't know, 2 nickles = 1 dime or 10 pennies = 1 dime). 

After the morning, have them toast your bagel since it may be starting to get hard after sitting in the bins exposed to air for a few hours."}
{"text":"Terrible service, unfriendly employees. This location is always out of bagels and never apologize. I won't be returning"}
{"text":"I ate my bagel that I chose out of the very few baked bagels. Now (15 minutes later) there are more bagels sitting in their baskets, which are not labeled correctly. I asked for the pumpkin walnut crunch to go, but they told me that it was apple and that they needed to set it down in the pumpkin walnut spot to rest and cool."}
{"text":"Consistently a great bagel. Always friendly and clean. Hit it at the perfect time, 6:45 on a Monday, no wait. In and out with a boxed dozen in less than 5 min."}
{"text":"Those geniuses at Einsteins keep thinking up new and improved menu items to keep me coming in! The bagel poppers rock for breakfast (think tiny bagel nuggets with a dipping sauce), and my new favorite lunch is the bagel thin sandwich. I recently had the Turkey Bacon & Avocado Bagel thin (under 400 calories) and it was fabulous! Apparently I should clarify \"turkey bacon\" = \"turkey bacon\" not turkey & bacon - if you check yelp reviews in other cities this confusion gets people upset . The avocado was quality and it had a yummy chipotle mayo type thing on it that gave it a great flavor. I got it with some delicious chili... a relatively light satisfying lunch!"}
{"text":"Give the older gentleman a raise!! Super kind and friendly. Brought my bagel directly out to me instead of calling my name to get up and get it."}
{"text":"First time in a bagel place and I would say it was ok.  I still can't figure out why one employee takes the order, another takes the money, another employee calls out orders and one more walks around asking if everything is ok.  All this for a bagel or sandwich seems wasteful of labor.  

Since this was my first time here, I ordered an ice tea, somehow I was supposed to know it was in the cooler on the way to the line for paying.  Guess I am just out of the loop at this place.  

Food was ok, nothing worth mentioning.  I could always get a bagel with coffee at another place and be just as content."}
{"text":"This place is terribly managed. There was no organization in line and there was no organization and check out. Their system that allows them to track rewards programs were down and when I gave them my phone number they proceeded to tell me that it was not my phone number (they literally said, no that is not your number)and that I need to sign up for a new account. I was a third person in line in a row to have the same problem and yet the manager blamed the customer every time and then walked away. Every order that was taken was rang up in accurately with in the point-of-sale system and again there was no accountability on behalf of the staff and the customer was blamed. I would never recommend anyone to ever go to this establishment and I'm tempted to just not go to Einstein bagels ever again."}
{"text":"Took my daughter here at 5:45 this morning to enjoy a little breakfast before school. Not only have we noticed the two girl workers not doing anything besides make fun of customers who come in and leave, they treated us badly as well. I didn't know customer service consisted of \"what do you want\" no goodmorning, no upselling, no help with the menu, literally nothing. Dirty looks included. We sat in the booth/table in the back and observed. The girls stared at us, finally one brought us our food and just put it down on the table, stared at us and walked away. I don't know if the manager is just blind to all of this or just doesn't care because she does nothing about it. The manager and the nice young man working were working really hard to prep the whole store while these two girls socialize and make fun of customers and from what I notice only smile and greet attractive young men who come in. I surely will not be bringing my daughter back in here if this is the way they run this place."}
{"text":"Agree with @Joel L. and everything he said...
This goes for all the EBs I've been to! 
There is nothing fantastic about EB. Decent? yes! Fantastic? Not so much. Overpriced? Absolutely!
I do have to say though that I really like the whipped cream cheese.
I'd probably give more stars if EVERYTHING was a bit cheaper...."}
{"text":"wanted 2 dz bagels and a couple smears.  the cashier asked me if i wanted a \"pack\" that included some extras and i said yes.  i didn't think the price would be $76!  i opted for the 2 dz and smears that came out to $35 instead.  the bagels were tasty and big with a nice mix of flavors.  would return."}
{"text":"Can you believe that they don't serve onion bagels here? It blows my mind! Everything else about this location is the same as any other Einsteins. Service is sometimes great and sometimes average."}
{"text":"I don't like giving negative reviews but this week really got under my skin. 
I went twice in one week and both time they screwed up my order. The first time they forgot my bagels. The second, it was bad. I ordered a pretzel bagel, with veggie garden schmear, avocado and turkey. Sounds amazing, right? What I got instead was a pumpkin bagel. Talk about a disgusting mess. Sorry Einstein's, I won't be back for a while until you get your affairs in order."}
{"text":"3/19/15 Update:

Like I said before, I really dig their bagels...and I live near by. So, even with my initial review, I have been back several times. I have to admit that they have gotten it together lately. I haven't received any incorrect orders from them since. I don't know if they hired, fired or re-trained someone, but whatever happened, it's finally working. 
I'm really glad I didn't just give up on them."}
{"text":"The lack of a management team at this location is baffling. There were 4 young females trying their hardest to train a new girl, who was working the front cashier position, and keep the flow of all the orders being made in an orderly fashion. From walk in to walk out I was there 25 minutes. That is uncalled for this type of establishment. The new girl had some issues with my order and called on another employee for help. After the 4th attempt my order was put in, I waited 15 minutes for a 1 egg cheddar bacon bagel on honey whole wheat, not a complicated order to make. 15 minutes of watching the chaos of these young women try their hardest to keep calm, train the new girl, get the orders in and made while having aggravated customers talk to them in irritated tones. I watched 3 customers who came in after me leave with their orders as I stood there looking at my bagel with egg and cheese sit on the food prep line for 2 minutes. I received my food and in the less than a minute drive it took me to get to my office my food was barely warm. Please get new management that is willing to be there for their team as well as their customers. And for goodness sake train your employees to talk to the guest like people, even in bad situations, if guest are told someone is new or they are short staffed people will react better when shit hits the fan."}
{"text":"Have never had a worse bagel in my life. Two separate ones - sesame and everything, both stale like they'd been out for days. Do not bother here - there's a Starbucks around the corner"}
{"text":"Convenient location and busy shop in the morning. The employees are friendly and efficient and keep their store clean. The bagels and cream cheese spreads are top notch. My favorite combination is the blueberry bagel with strawberry cream cheese."}
{"text":"I really prefer not to leave negative reviews. 

However when my bagel is black as charcoal I have to speak up. 

It just seemed so careless to get two burnt bagels when I was the only customer at the time...

You'll notice in the picture I ate the non burnt part, but that was less then half.


The coffee was cold, even if it was 12pm.

Either serve hot coffee or no coffee.

We implore you to improve this, I don't want to drive to Thomas Rd to get bagels, please!"}
{"text":"I stopped in yesterday for a bagel before work and the staff was arguing.  There wasn't anyone in line; after a minute they finally stopped long enough to take my order then continued to argue. I waited another minute then walked out.  Nobody took the time to even start making my bagel.  From what I've read on here,  this place needs a staff makeover before they go out of business.  The place was empty and for a Friday morning that's crazy!!!"}
{"text":"Great Bagels. Green Chile Bagel was terrific. I like this place better than Panera."}
{"text":"Good service good food fast. Can't ask for more. Even with only two ppl on staff they were friendly and quick. And I love the mixed berry smoothie"}
{"text":"Our company ordered from this location for a lunch meeting today. All orders were placed yesterday. Mostly bagel sandwiches with a couple of salads. Those of us that ordered salads were left high and dry for our 90 minute meeting. I am gluten free so could not eat the bagel and the cookie that came in place of my salad. I was miserable watching everyone else eat. All I could concentrate on was how hungry I am. During a very important meeting. The employee responsible for the lunch order missed the first 20 minutes because she was on the phone with Einsteins trying to get a resolution. She was passed off to corporate who told her they didn't have the ingredients to make the salads. Um what?! She was then told they didn't have a driver to bring the salads if they did have the ingredients. Again, what??
The kicker is that 90 minutes later, two salads arrived. Greens, chicken and almonds, with balsamic dressing. Not even close to what each of us ordered! And 90 minutes later? After you said you didn't have the ingredients or a driver? I would be SO embarrassed if I were Einsteins. I would NEVER in a million years order from Einsteins again. If you can't fulfill a simple order for 11 people, why bother to offer catering in the first place? I would give ZERO stars if I could. And probably only because I'm HANGRY."}
{"text":"There should be a ZERO star option for this place! I ordered two bagels with cream
Cheese. The guy who took my order was so busy laughing and joking with the other employees he asked me twice if I wanted my bagels toasted. I guess that was too much to remember. After being made to wait for him to finish socializing he handed me the bag. I did not think to verify if the order was correct and went home. We sat down to each lunch and sure enough, dry bagels and NO CREAM CHEESE! I called over there to find out what could be done and was told I would have to bring them back in to get cream cheese or to get a refund (a refund only if I brought the bagels back!). No apology for the inconvenience, the gas in my car and my time. The idea of spending an hour to go there for them to put cream cheese on my bagel or get a refund is beyond a joke! My advice: do not go there unless you want to feel like you are imposing on people's social hour, want stale, dry bagels and lousy service!"}
{"text":"Always a safe bet for quick and efficient service, and who doesn't like Einstein's bagels!!!  This is location is always busy, but it is clean an the bagels are solid."}
{"text":"Sad to learn this morning that this location switched their iced coffee to cold brew, which Is good, but I liked their iced coffee better. It was the reason I was in here two to three times a week. The cold brew costs more, too. They kindly gave me my cold brew today for the cost of a refill, but I'm thinking $3.55 for iced cold brew might cause me to switch back to hot coffee."}
{"text":"I said I would never come here agen because of the horrible services I received last time. However my bf wanted to come here because he likes your sandwitches. So I agreed to tagging along. The gentleman in front of use walked out out and said to use befor he left that he had been waiting for over 10min and not one of the employs had acknowledged . being that we were very hungry and had not eaten breakfast we decided that we would wait still. We the only people in line waited another 8min. Not one of your employs said hello, we will be with you in a minute, we were not acknowledged at all. It was like we were not even there. Iv had horrible service before this was beyond that."}
{"text":"The Starbucks of bagel places and I don't mean that in a good way.  It seems like there is one on every corner.  And I am a bit of a bagel snob.  It seemed like the dough was frozen and not baked properly.  Sorry guys you might be ok for your average gentile smuck but you can't pull the wool over my eyes"}
{"text":"I frequent this location at least once a week since it opened. 
I have to say that the service is terrible. TERRIBLE. 
The employees look miserable and make no attempt to hide it. They run out of products early I the day and it is always dirty and not kept up. 
The only reason we go here is because it is convenient to our home. But at this point, I'm going to start going to a different one. 
The service is deplorable and I hope the owner/manager takes this review seriously and does something about it. 
Yelp will not permit the reviewer to leave NO star rating, so I am forced to give it one star. Not even worthy of that."}
{"text":"Great Idea, execution can be better. Bagels and cream cheese are very good, pretty much any combination. I go there for lox, but looks like smoked salmon was recalled so they do not carry it anymore. 

Staff is not very upbeat, my husband was trying to make a joke, the lady did not even smile but almost started arguing....

Asking for any modifications is not a good idea - I've asked before to go easy with the cream-cheese  so they went light on everything.

Had a pesto chicken lunch sandwich - very bland and I'm still hungry! (normally 6in subway sandwich is too much for me)"}
{"text":"Love Einstein bagels.  This is local to our house and I frequent 3-4 timers per month.  Place is always clean and service is usually fast."}
{"text":"Its always great. (In the mornings) my asparagus egg mushroom bagel didn't have the sause it usually does and my chicken noodle soup was just not good. Next time Ill just come earlier."}
{"text":"Over time I've made it to this location periodically, I live nearby and bagels in the morning can't be beat.  While their bagels are fresh and good the restaurant itself is awful.  The service is painfully slow and always seems disorganized.   On the last visit it was frankly filthy.  The trash can was overflowing the counter had  paper and debris on it and none of the tables were wiped off.  The person taking our order continually talked to other staff members while taking the order and got several items wrong.   I think I'll skip it from now on."}
{"text":"I usually stop in here 2 or 3 times a week after class. the staff is always super friendly. Today Tayvon bought my bagel for me which was really cool of him. I'm pretty simplistic when it comes to bagels. I like my blueberry bagel toasted with spread but they always have suggestions about what they enjoy and every now and then i try them. I'm usually in an hour before they close and the bagels still seem pretty fresh.

I go because i love bagels, but the service has kept me coming back."}
{"text":"Why bother send patrons coupons and our discounts when you do not want to honor them. And your staff decides to be argumentative and rude in front of other patrons. Well I for one will no long shop at any of your locations. You just lost a valued customer."}
{"text":"I ordered the Lox sandwich as well as an everything bagel with cream cheese. Bagels tasted fresh and delicious (onion bagel and everything bagel). The Lox is the reason for the 3 stars. It's good, but lacks the freshness you get when going to a traditional deli. With that said I would definitely order it again there if I was craving it and there wasn't a deli nearby. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"Not pleased. I will say that the food is very good. 
1 they are ALWAYS out of lots of bagels, I always have to have a different bagel that the one that I want because they are out. 
They vacuum and put the chairs up at 3 and they close at 5
The staff is very unprofessional 
The food is super over priced for what it is
They need a manager to help run this place this place looks like it's run by children!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure the reason for the poor rating here. I find staff very friendly. The place is always busy- so people keep coming back... at times, the wait is a little long- but not a big issue."}
{"text":"They are really busy Saturday mornings but its my absolute favorite place to get bagels right now. The pretzel bagel toasted with plain cream cheese and a green tea is my favorite combo."}
{"text":"This is a first time at this location. Had to tell 5 times that I have allergies and can't have any milk in my order. Asked for cold drink with soy milk that I usually ordering at other locations. Reminded about milk it's not that I don't like taste I do have allergies. In a car on a way home about 5 min after I finished my drink and started driving I had a sever reaction swollen throat and cough. I couldn't breathe. I had to use my epipen to stop it. I don't know what they put in my drink,I throw away my cup at the store before we  left, other wise I would take it with me to the hospital or to the lab. 
Tried to call the store after I came home and could breath again. But no one is picking up the phone. 
Never gonna go there again. And definitely will try to contact corporation office. It is a first time when I have the exact opposite result after being nice and explained the Health situation to workers. 
U can't joke with Health problems"}
{"text":"I went to this location this morning. The food was good, but the employees were kinda rude."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Einstein bagel shop.  The bagels are good for a chain, but the line here in the morning is always ridiculous and slow moving.  If you are looking for a quick breakfast to go, this probably isn't the place to stop...especially on the weekend."}
{"text":"I love Einstein's and I like to stop in on occasion.  We visit this location off and on when we are headed to Chandler Fashion mall.  This place is always clean and the staff is very friendly.

The food I had today wasn't the greatest, but I was also expanding outside my usual.  They also messed up my order a little which was annoying but i was too tired to really care at the time.

Overall, definitely a great place to eat and one that i am sure we will be back to again."}
{"text":"I really appreciate the helpfulness of the employees at this location. On Fathers Day I stopped in to get bagels for my family. I called ahead and asked them to put my order together before I got there since I had my dog with me in the car.  They had everything ready to go and I was in and out before my dog even knew I left the car.  (FYI, I cracked the windows and was back in the car within 3 minutes. My dog was fine.)"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible! This place is extremely disorganized and they don't know how to make the sandwiches listed on their menu. Then when they try to remake it it took forever so I just asked for a refund. I won't be returning the service is terrible!"}
{"text":"My go to place for coffee and a breakfast sandwich.  I go there so often for the turkey sausage on a 6 cheese bagel that the staff call me by my first name.  Very friendly staff and unlike Starbucks I have never had to wait to have the half and half thermos refilled."}
{"text":"This place is really sad... Does management even care about this location and the tons of horrible reviews?

I used to work at a Noah's Bagels as a teen and I gave better customer service than this place ever has. First, the two girls that were there today, one short and one tall with glasses were completely oblivious to the fact that there were two customers that just walked in... including myself. They acted as if they were too good to greet us, and that refilling the straws and cleaning absolutely HAD to be done before paying any attention to us.

I ordered a simple mushroom swiss egg sandwich, and the girl with the glasses gave me the most attitude ever. She snottily said to me she \"HEARD\" me when I asked if i could have a little butter on the sandwich. Sorry... I didn't realize you were listening to me because you weren't even looking at me, nor acting like I even existed.

This is the best part... I get home, and there is NO EGG on my egg sandwich. Great job guys... I know you were 30 minutes from going home, but this is your job. You get paid to do this... act like it. And Einstein... this location gives your brand a HORRIBLE image. Dirty store, rude employees and nearly zero options for bagels at all hours of the day.

Biggest waste of $7 I've ever spent on a NO EGG egg sandwich.
Oh... and $.50 to add three strips of red onion??? Come on."}
{"text":"Busy place! It was everything you'd expect from an Einstein Bros Bagels. Nothing special. I'll go back, but be prepared to wait in a long line if you go on a weekend morning between 7-11am"}
{"text":"It is really sad to give this place a one star.  I was really excited to have an einstein near my house and I have been to two other locations of einstein bagels and this is the ONLY location that is completely horrible.  

The people here a are completely rude and unprofessional. When I ordered the person that was taking my order just asked, \"What do you want?....That's it?...Go over there.\"  He seemed so unhappy and hated life.  

Now, I go on to the second register to pay.  I believe he was the manager of this einstein location and surprisingly he looked unhappy, too.  Sighs, I went to pay and I am sure he heard me say. \"Wow, the people that work here are so rude.\"  

I took a bite of my chocolate chip bagel with regular smear & it was overfilled with  cream cheese and my bagel is burnt. Sighs, shaking my head. 

I hope one day, I can update my review and give it a better rating.  As for now, one star is what they will get."}
{"text":"I normally love Einsteins, however I will never visit this one again and recommend others avoid it. It started out, I stood under the \"Order Here\" sign for almost 10 minutes, made eye contact with at least 2 employees. I finally asked about ordering, and was told that they were taking orders at the \"pick up orders\" end of the line. I asked why they tell me that when they saw me standing there - she responded that the employee by the register was announcing it - no apologies. I went down the line and ordered, then waited 20 minutes while they prepared my single toasted bagel with shmear. While waiting, I noticed a line of 3 form under the \"order here\" sign. Again, workers ignored them and left them standing there. I finally went over and told them to move. Terrible service, terrible attitudes. My earlier review was removed because it lacked detail, thus the reason for the detail here. It was by far the worst experience I've had at Einsteins. If it was the only one I could access, I would never go again, fortunately I have a great Einsteins just down the street from my home."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a quick bite to eat waiting for your flight. We had a pizza bagel and a bs on egg cheese bagel. If I had to pick I would pick the pizza bagel the other bagel was a bit dry."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but honestly, I would rate the bagels below those of Winco or even Smith's. They tasted like they were made made the day before and just sat out in the bin overnight. Not fresh at all. I expected better from Einstein's."}
{"text":"The food is usual Einstein Bros. fare and is okay per usual. The ordering system is bizarre and confusing since you basically have to order your bagels and coffee separately even though it's a tiny store. The cashier then makes your coffee drink while you and everyone else in line wait. It seems unnecessarily confusing, espcially in a hotel location where there aren't many regulars. 

The place itself is okay if you need breakfast but I'd imagine ordering and paying is a disaster when it's packed."}
{"text":"If this review were based solely on the friendliness of the staff they'd get 5 stars. However this place runs out of smoked salmon on a daily basis. I once called first to make sure they had it. I left work and arrived within minutes and was told they had sold out. I've even waited in line for 10+ minutes to be told they sold the last piece to the guy in front of me. It's frustrating to say the least. I'm not sure if they need more staff or better corporate communication with ordering."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Einsteins in Vegas. The crew has their stuff together and manage to fill orders and serve food in record time. They're friendly to boot! My main reason for not visiting the one closer to my work is becuase of the time iit takes to order and recieve it. This one has employees that understand the sense of urgency I'm in when I drop by on my way to work."}
{"text":"As far as einsteins go this one is at the bottom
Of my list. They never use enough butter, rarely ever have most bagels and make my girlfriend uncomfortable. As I work during the day time she usually goes twice a week in the morning for bagels. She literally texted me once asking if I could go with her over the weekend so they know she's Unavailable because they always are \"creepy\" and hit on her in strange ways. The only good thing about this place ever after my many visits was one time they were giving out smoothie samples. That's it. This place serves terrible bagels simply because they don't put enough topping on them and cut them horribly. The guys working aren't professional. Overall just a s****y einsteins"}
{"text":"This Einstein location has the worst service I've seen around here. The staff is kind enough, but there is a huge chance that your order will be wrong in some way. Once I had chicken in my honey almond shmear, how does that happen?"}
{"text":"Great service and food for a bagel shop.  You wouldn't go here for atmosphere."}
{"text":"Decent bagel place for breakfast. Bagel sandwiches are 4.80 but they only charge 1.05 for plain bagels and a bit more for stranger types. Staff was quick and polite. They also offered free wifi while you wait, or if you want to dine in. 

The only reason this is only a 3, is because McDonalds breakfast sandwiches are considerably cheaper and a better taste in my opinion. I have simple tastes though so I didn't get anything too fancy."}
{"text":"We keep hoping this location improves as it is the closest- we are consistently disappointed.. we are here frequently --  and every time the toasted bagel is burned at the edges .. rarely is there all coffees available.. overall frustrating .. they are not able to handle volume"}
{"text":"Was craving a lox bagel and this cured the craving. Everything bagel with plain cream cheese with lox, it was good. Not great or anything. Just good. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This store needs to get to it together. I will never come back to this location, ever. I waited 45 minutes for my first order the first time I came and they ran out of what I wanted so I didn't leave happy the first time...and this 2nd trip was the cherry topping- I called in my order to avoid having to wait..and make sure they would have wanted. 2 Asiago bagles with butter. Nothing complicated. They said ok and I got there...paid...and they made my order...waited another 30 minutes for the guy to call me over and say \"Hey we don't have any Asaigo bagels\"...my jaw hit the floor. Then why why did why did I why did I pay for that? And I wait 30 minutes to find this out? His response was the worst part...\"I had 3 people call out today\". That sounds like a personal problem & flaw in your business operation. I ended up grabbing the bag of plain bagels that I sufficed with and left the location telling the manager to their face I will never be back. Really disappointed Einsteins. No effort to recorrect my order."}
{"text":"Their salad tastes bad, but pumpkin bagel with schmear is good."}

{"text":"I love getting to school early so i can stop and get a bagel before going in. My favorites are the everything bagels , they also toast and put cream cheese on them for you"}
{"text":"Fast service. Good food. Love the pre-made salads you can buy. Chai tea is amazing so if you like chai tea from Starbucks definitely try it here too! All the employees are nice and always have a smile on their face. Easy to find if you've never been here before, good sign to where you can spot it right away. Parking lot is big but if there is not spots you can always park by Walgreens. Sandwiches are all good but their paninis are the best! The store is not that big itself so there is not a lot of seating inside but there is some seating outside which is nice they thought of that. Lines can long, but usually they aren't that long if you go mid-morning, late afternoon."}
{"text":"Not my favourite. Service is friendly however the food and bagels are average and don't measure up to the deli across the street. I absolutely hate the ordering and payment system (order at one computer at  and pay another). I don't see the hype and honestly  it is not my favourite bagel place. They easily get overwhelmed once there are a few people in line. I ordered the Nova lox bagel and they barely gave me any smoked salmon!"}
{"text":"If you are in a hurry, do not come here!! Worst customer service, no one is ever behind the counter! And the sandwiches taste like crap. DONT COME HERE"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service displayed by Vanna the shift manager. I came here on Thursday and arrived shortly before 7am.  No one was up front when I entered, so I stood there awkwardly for about 3 minutes before Vanna came to take my order.  No smile, no greeting, just \"know what you want\".  I placed my order and moved to the register.  

Vanna came to the register a few minutes after making mine, and another patrons bagels (and running to the back about half a dozen times).  She shoved the bagel in my hand and mumbled something about needing to get her till.  So I'm standing there with the bagel, my credit card, again waiting on her.  

Customer service was awful. A million things could've happened that morning to create a hectic start to the day, but the customer shouldn't know it.  A shift manager should be friendly, inviting, and quick, or at least apologize if there are obvious issues.  Too bad she didn't get the memo."}
{"text":"Not a busy morning for Einstein's. Went here to grab a few breakfast items.

Picked up nova lox, egg bacon and cheddar cheese bagels and bacon brew house sand which that is featured on a pretzel bagel or cheddar bagel.

Lady informed that they were out of the pretzel bagels when they have them advertised with this as a choice. Best make more of them if they're on your menu as an option.

I'd rather take the drive to bagel cafe from now on"}
{"text":"Einstein Bros Bagels is close to my office, we buy it every so often. I went today and purchased for one of my employees and myself. 

When I walked in, there was no line. Everyone was kind of just hanging out in front of the bagel counter. Only one person was behind the counter taking orders and then taking the payment down the counter further. 

While I was standing in line another customer stepped in front of me wanting to order, not knowing I was in line. It's fine, simple mistake. I think having someone at both the order register and payment register would help further confusion as to where the line is. I ordered two turkey sausage sandwiches with egg whites to go on everything bagels and a cold brewed coffee. 

My name was called and I got my items and took them back to work. I took a bite of my sandwich and there was really no flavor, good or bad just kinda mehh. The coffee was alright as well, I enjoyed that more than the food.

Staff is as nice as they can be for a busy understaffed place in the mornings. I recommend having at least one more person to man the registers during the busy times."}
{"text":"Little disappointing. wait on one line where there is a cashier helping someone. There was no one at the other cashier station. Waiting for about 5 minutes then someone walks in goes to the empty cash register and they take them right away. Should be a better system of letting new customers know where to go. Walked out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Einstiens!  Not only is there hardly ever a line but the people who work there are great.  They always load up my bagel with cream cheese or my power bagel with pb&j.  They are awesome.  They have just as good of a selection as the one on McDowell PLUS they serve beer.  You really can't beat that.  It also makes for a great place to people watch.  Big 5-star review for the best Einsteins in town."}
{"text":"This location makes me hate the entire Einsteins franchise.  Seriously, the people who go here never know what they want and just dick around in line.  Then, on top of that, the people who work here can't manage to get an order right - ever.  I always get a pb&j power bagel...except for when they are out of power bagels (which seems more common than one might imagine).  What I end up getting is a rock hard power bagel cut in half with peanut butter on it and a little container of jelly.  Um, why am I doing your job?  Aren't I paying you for the ability to make a bagel?  Why must I do this?  I hate spreading jelly on top of peanut butter and since you decided to but pb on each side of my bagel (AND TOAST IT, which I didn't ask for) I now have to do this disgusting task.  I hate you and everything about you.  I also hate macbook guy who sits at the 4-top with his laptop in one spot, his bag in another, his iphone in the third, and his coffee in the fourth.  Thanks for takin up the whole table d-bag.  I'll make sure to spill my drink on your Prius on my way out."}
{"text":"10 am, 3 bagels left in whole display case.  Only after inquiring when will there be more bagels ready did face tattoo tell us it'd be 40 minutes.  Begs the question, why did you wait so long to get more in the oven.  I would recommend this place to someone on April Fools day.  C'mon manager, it says Bagel in the name.  By the way, 5 other customers walked and I had a party of 5 as well.  Terrible.  Wished I had taken a pic for posterities sake."}
{"text":"How hard is it to cut a bagel? I am seriously annoyed with this location. Every week we buy bagels and it's the same thing. A bagel cut so badly by their machine, that you can't eat it properly. It's funny because they only seem to screw up the plain bagels when being cut. Our everything bagels were cut perfectly. Not only that but the people they employ can't handle long lines on bagel Mondays. Time to find a new bagel location."}
{"text":"Yes, it was busy, but I was flabbergasted by the fact that it took them longer to get orders out than the burrito place across the way (which had an even longer line!).

My hummus veggie something bagel sandwich was fine - but definitely nothing to write home about - and to reiterate, it took them a LONG time and it costs about the same as a burrito - so, unless you're really dying for a bagel and just need something to eat - I'd recommend going the other way to burritos."}
{"text":"Avoid this einstein's at all cost. I have been laying in bed puking for over 12 hours because I ate at this garbage dump. The reason I know it was them? My girl is laying next to me puking as well. And the only place we both ate together less than 24 hours ago was there.

The incompetent staff that happens to grace this poorly operating business cannot tell the difference between a large drink and a medium and take over 10 minutes to make two identical sandwiches.

After we got home and ate them, fast forward 6 hours and we are both puking our brains out.

The most common reason for this to happen is when an employee does not wash their hands after getting feces on them. Then they touch my food and I get sick. Based on the staff that day, it does not surprise me one bit.

I would recommend starving over going here. Never again. Now I will go speak to Ralph on the big white telephone some more."}
{"text":"Over priced small dingy flat bagels
???? not worth it ... if your a new Yorker stay away ... this place will make you cry  I know ???"}
{"text":"their service is amazing; we catered 3 1/2 dozen bagels for my birthday brunch and they had everything ready earlier than expected with amazing costumer service. thank you!"}
{"text":"I called In an order for a bakers dozen bagels.  Picked up and grabbed a smear of cream cheese. Returned home to discover I received miniature bagels. The order was sliced as requested, but they were a third smaller in size then they should have been.  This is the second time this happened to me from this location.  I called and spoke to Kylie or kalie.  She explained that the dough was of same quantity, but rose up instead of spread out. A great canned script. She was quite nice and offered to return my $ , but I wasn't going to run back to the business in 110 heat for a refund on bagels. 
Maybe instead of a canned line to cover the poor monitoring of the baking of their goods the management should not allow the smaller bagels to go out in the future!"}
{"text":"This place is really disorganized and could do a lot better.  Order an egg sandwich and you might get it in 1/2 hour or more.  And most likely, your order will be wrong.  That's what we experienced.  Then, when you take it back to get the correct order, expect to wait another 1/2 hour for them to make it.  This place just doesn't have any urgency, especially when they screw up, which happens a lot.  On top of all that, generally some of the coffee pots are empty and you'll wait awhile for them to fill them.  In general, they are also missing a lot things on their menu so be prepared to modify your order."}
{"text":"I told my boyfriend how good Einstein Bagels was based on a prior experience at another location. As we came in the door I noticed how dirty and run down it was. There were six employee's behind the counter and it wasn't very busy. We placed an order for 2 bagel sandwiches on toasted bagels and sat down. A very short time later our food was brought out and it was awful. The bagels were not toasted, the sausage was cold and the cheese wasn't melted. We picked at the food and left. I apologized and told him not to base his opinion off this experience."}
{"text":"It's an Einstein. The patio seating is what differentiates this location. A great destination for dog walkers. And you can pick up a doggie bagel for your pooch for a buck. There also always seem to be friendly customers anxious to interact with the canine diners.

I tend to arrive late with my family. Even though they are suppose to be open until 3:00 p.m. on Sundays, they stop replenishing bagels and will run out of many of the most popular (or is it just our favorite?) bagel flavors well before that. Not unusual, but the employees seem tired of the issue and react with a take it or leave it attitude. Good luck if you arrive after 1:00, or even noon. Most other days they close at 5:00 and have the same problem, just a little later.

For the most part, however, employees are friendly here."}
{"text":"Went in today for a bagel an cream cheese. I used to always get a sun dried tomato bagel and today I found out it's discontinued. :( I will not be coming back anymore."}
{"text":"This place is great. Super nice and helpful for starters, especially given it was our first time there. They have a wide variety of bagel based products which I loved. I loved the breakfast sandwiches. Super yummy. It started to get busy but they made our order in a quick manner. Will come back!"}
{"text":"I put in a catering on 9/5. I received this order today, missing 2 spread.  This is the 4th  time IN A ROW...that spread was missing from my order.  I call each time, and get the same apology, and someone is rushed over to bring spread. I now put in my orders to be delivered 45 minutes before I need them, because I am so nervous that the order will be wrong. 
my company currently spends $100+ a month with Einstein, and I have never been so disappointed with a company in my life.   This isn't the first series of mishaps with Einstein, I put in a complaint earlier this year/last year having the same issues...missing Bagels/ Spread.  I had 3 good orders with this store, and then it went downhill from there--AGAIN.  Honestly, I kept ordering because of convenience, now I will take the story of how my company has been treated to their competitor and I'm sure they will be happy to serve me.

This order was literally 19 Bagels (Bakers Dozen + 6 Bagels on the side. Bakers Dozen is 13...not 12)  and 4 Spread.  HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN????? Oh, I forgot to mention I received my 6 bagels on the side in a bag, and they were completely SMASHED. SERIOUSLY?

DO NOT USE THIS STORE FOR CATERING."}
{"text":"I have to say, I try to go to indie-restaurants as much as possible, but I love Einstein's six-cheese bagels and the dutch apple bagels.  So, stopping there to fill my craving I had a most pleasant experience. This was a Friday morning, busy but not like the usual weekend insanity.  The staff was so friendly, clearly remembering some regulars.  The manager was hustling around, checking on customers, taking orders to tables and bringing out fresh coffee.  The service was so quick and friendly!  Good job guys!"}
{"text":"I ordered a bagel with lox to go, what I got was a bagel with a piece of salmon. That's it. No cream cheese, no onion, no capers, no tomato. A bagel. With a piece of salmon. 

At least my cat got a good breakfast."}
{"text":"I just had a terrible first experience here. We went on a Monday afternoon, ordered a bagel bucket. The girl getting our bagels insisted that we could only choose 12, I had to point to the menu to show her that the bucket has 13. Their bagels were smaller than normal Einsteins and very over-baked, burnt in spots.

They had a pay pass for the credit card, so my husband did that as I handed her our coupon (he was a little over-eager to use the pay pass). The older cashier woman said that as soon as it registered the credit card, the transaction was complete and she couldn't take my coupon. I asked if she could void it, and she said to just use the coupon next time. I told her I'd really like to use it now (we don't go that often), and she said it would be a hassle for her records to do the refund. I asked if she could please do it anyways, and she did (very grumpily). We had to sign the refund receipt before she re-did the transaction, and when asked if she had a pen she replied \"No, we don't have any pens.\" What business doesn't have a pen? So I fish through my purse and finally found a pen. She also wouldn't let me use my $5 gift card AND a 25% off coupon, I had to choose which one I wanted to use. I wasn't sure when she was finished with the second transaction, because she didn't say \"ok,\" \"thank you,\" or anything.

Some of the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. Save yourself a hassle and go down to the Einsten on Chandler Blvd. by 101. Whoever is managing this place needs to really focus on their customer service, and I am not surprised why business there is incredibly sparse."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Einstein's in probably one year. My go to item a spinach bacon Panini was no longer on the menu however three employees knew exactly what I was talking about and re-created my sandwich! I'm one happy customer"}
{"text":"Worst Einstein bagel shop I've ever been to.  Terrible staff,  and the slowest service.  Waited 20 minutes with no line for 1 toasted bagel and the Orange juice tasted like diluted sunny d."}
{"text":"Einstein..... hmmm I hear Einstein and I think smart. I hear Bagel and I think delicious. So take those and slam them together you get a Smart and Delicious Bagel... I have tried multiple selections here from the pizza bagels which are good, the sauce is a little tangy, the ham and cheese bagel was great and the topper for me are the Breakfast sandwiches on a bagel. I think our buddy Albert would be proud to know that they are stepping outside of the bagel and making it something unique. 

One of the other things I tend to like this place for is the diversity, you can eat hear for breakfast or lunch and well I guess dinner and you have plenty of options. The service has always been spot on and friendly.. Keep it up I'm sure ole Albert is throwing a Wahoooo your way!!"}
{"text":"Very rude management if you are taking more then 10 second to place your order , then you will have bad face , becarefull with add on they will charge you up to $9 for bagel with cream cheese ."}
{"text":"Felt like a bagel and decided to stop by here.  Decent.  A-OK.  Got an everything bagel with cream cheese, a pretzel bagel, and a garlic bagel to save for later.  Everything bagel was nicely toasted and had an even spread of cream cheese (more is always not better...I'm not a big fan of super globs of cream cheese on my bagels) which was awesome.  Pretzel bagel had a nice crust and lots of salt.  Service was friendly enough...not great, not poor.  Just under $6.00 for 3 bagels (one with cream cheese).  If I'm craving a bagel again, and near work, I will probably be back."}
{"text":"10am on a sunday morning and they run out of bagels .They had 2 kinds left in the baskets.  How does a company that only sells one thing on their menu run out"}
{"text":"Consistently comes to my rescue when I need a place to chill. I wish they were open for dinner. Today is what made me write the review. Went to one place, line was out the door. Went to another- same deal. Went to Einsteins and they were busy but not crazy busy. More like steady. Next time I'll go there first. Love the cranberry tasty turkey on a cranberry bagel. Love their seasonal food too!"}
{"text":"I usually go to this location and the one at Tatum and Shea. This one is much better. They get the order correct mroe than the other store. Food is good. Enough variety to please everyone. They change up the menu seasonally and I like that."}
{"text":"They really do everything right. Great drinks, great food. My husband loves the italian chicken panini and I love the club mex on the challa. Yum. I also like to spon-tin-a-i-tea! (get it??) Yum! Did I mention- YUM!? Wish they were open for dinner."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy Starbucks if I want a sit-down breakfast alone away from home. The Starbucks at Von's Plaza is too tiny to expect to get seating, so I took my business to Einstein's next door.  Guess what? Same problem: tiny seating area. However, I think Einstein's gets slightly less traffic, so I was able to get a table.

Although Einstein's definitely has many more food options and therefore a bigger breakfast selection, I think Starbucks wins the breakfast sandwich contest. Theirs is hotter and tastes better.  Einstein's turkey sausage sandwich was bland and the cheese wasn't even melted. Bleh."}
{"text":"Came in at 9 on a Sunday to beat the church crowd and to kill some time. Not busy, 3 people working the toasters 3 girls chit chatting and one walking around...nobody to take orders until someone on the toasting machine called. The girl seemed stoned, moving hella slow giggling about who the eff knows. We get to the cashier, same service...I'm confused, are we huffing something in the back that's making us move slower than sloths??"}
{"text":"I'm at this location weekly as I meet some friends on Sunday mornings and my office is near by.  The staff is nice and the dinning room is usually clean, service is good but the men's room is often not clean...not horrible but not clean. The last time I was there early Sunday the restroom was absolutely disgusting. No paper towels, filthy dirty top to bottom which means no one cleaned it the night before nor checked it at all.  I've been in gas station restrooms that were great better.  It also means the employees are using the same restroom and not taking care of anything,  Probably not washing their hands... Doesn't seem like this is a location I want to continue to visit if it's going to be dirty like that."}
{"text":"So I get this Birthday coupon in the email from Einstein Brothers Bagles, I print it out with the hope of stopping in on my walk into work in the morning.  A free breakfast sandwich with the purchase of a drink.  

On the morning I make it in I showed it to one lady and she responds, \"Oh yeah no problem, order your sandwich here and your drink at the register.\"  So I order my sandwich, bacon, egg and cheddar on an Everything bagle and move up to the register to order my chai.  
I hand the girl at the register my coupon too and in a whiney-sigh calls for the manager.  The manager comes to the counter and proceeds to tell me that they are a franchise and do not accept corporate coupons. 
HUH?!
To which I replied, slightly annoyed, \"F*ck it I just ordered the sandwich give me my chai and I'll pay.\"  ...$9....it hit a bit hard for breakfast since I was only looking to spend $4-$5. 

Well back at my office I can say that I did enjoy my breakfast sandwich and my chai.  Would I go back?  Yes, but the next time my mind set will be different and I would be there with the intent of spending $9 for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"I tried their new little stuffed bagels this morning. Ever since seeing on Shark Tank Bantam Bagels, I've been obsessed with tony stuffed bagels. My mom has brought me Bantam Bagels, her Safeway in Northern California sells them, and I've got them from Starbucks but finally...Einstein's has them too!  And in a choice of flavors!  

I got a variety of pretzel filled with beer cheese (maybe cheddar) and everything filled with plain. They looked a little pale in the case but I figured maybe when they're heated they'll brown up. I also didn't see any pretzel ones and was afraid they were out. Or thought maybe they added the salt later. I got my order and hopped back in the car and took a bite and while the bottom was warm, the top was wet and they were inedible salty. I think, and I could be wrong, these must ship to them frozen and they thawed out covered and the condensation melted all the salt making the top gooey (wet) and the whole thing overly salty. Maybe because these are new they just don't have a hang of them yet? My everything one was a little pale too and definitely couldn't have been browner. I can make them out of a box frozen, transported on a flight here and they are better. It shouldn't be that way."}
{"text":"Good food if you have no where else to go and youre extremely hungry. Nice people. And very laid back enviornment. I dont think ill be back but it is good and you can tell its kind of healthy depending on what you get. I got w bagel sandwiches of spinach mushrooms eggs and swiss. It was good the bagel had lots of seeds. Had a blackberry lemonade real good. Came out to be $13 I guess its a bit pricy but decent amount too."}
{"text":"this store is inside the Hyatt so it's not as big as a regular place - a couple of times they have run out of certain bagels or fillings when there have been conventions or other group meets. the staff can be a tad slow but again, it all depends on the number of people... my bagel with lox and shmear is always good!!! and there are a couple of nice comfy chairs and a couch - if you can grab it"}
{"text":"This is by far the slowest Einstein's ever. If i was judging based solely off the food, they'd get four stars, but the fact that it can take 15+ minutes for a bagel is ridiculous. The staff are never friendly and it looks like their sense of teamwork is non-existent. Maybe they need some more customer service training? I have to resort to a Starbucks bagel in the mornings cause who has time to wait around here forever?"}
{"text":"Horrible. Ordered a pizza bagel (which they charge over $5 for) had about 1/2 teaspoon of sauce and a few shreds of cheese (see photo). Laughable. I won't be back here."}
{"text":"Been here a few times 
Early Saturday morning 
The staff are super nice 
But it always takes up to 10 to 15 minutes wait 
And there is always confusion with to go or eat in 
Seems like all the locations have issues 
Why can't the management team support here"}
{"text":"This location is always busy Sunday mornings. They work their butts off to get us all served. Their food is always good - from the bagels to the salads to the sandwiches. Pretty healthy too. The staff are friendly as well. Been coming here for years and will keep coming."}
{"text":"I love Einstein.  Fresh bagels are the bomb!  This Einstein is consistent with the others.  I think the layout is odd the way you have to enter and cross the store to start your order.  It's also a little cramped.  Most Einsteins are layed out better than this one.  Great location facing Papa John's across the street."}
{"text":"Love coming here in the morning, the morning staff is great! I wish service would go faster in the morning though."}
{"text":"Why oh why does it take 15 mins to make a bagel straight from the menu? They have 4people on the line for prep and the wait is just ridiculous.
If that's the typical turn time then they should let a customer know. Then I'll be more understanding. But I'm gonna stop giving business because I just don't have the time to wait."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times to have the thin whole wheat bagel with turkey and cheddar cheese, add tomato and red onion.  I'm not big on bagel sandwiches because of the starchiness of the bagel, but I actually enjoyed this as a decent, healthy lunch in the area.

Thankfully, my husband hasn't been on a bagel kick in awhile so I haven't had to go here much for actual bagels."}
{"text":"Horrible attitude from two guys that are working there. Just came in on a Sunday afternoon 20 min before closing. Just for a  bagel and cream cheese you could clearly see they were annoyed by my presence because they're trying to close early. Advice hire people who aren't easily annoyed by serving the public. I get wanting to be done with work but not when there's 20 min before closing. My niece and I felt so uncomfortable. Please advise your staff in appropriate ways to handle the public even if it's close to closing!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, no complaint in that department. Where I have an issue is with the management. I ordered a cold brew coffee as well as other stuff to which I drink throughout the day. I told them I didn't want any ice because it waters down my drink throughout the day and doesn't taste good later in the day. The \"store manager\" hand me a cup half full and says here ya go. I looked shocked as you could imagine. I said \"why is this half full\" and her response was \"if I fill it all the way I have to charge you double\". I was blown away with her absolutely below management response. I was shocked that I paid almost $4.00 for a half cup of black coffee and the manager wouldn't add a once more. Needless to say I will never walk in that store with such horrible management running the business. Hopefully if you go they help you out because I talked to the corporate manager and he was extremely shocked she did that and was going to let every store manager know to fill the cups if the customer asks for it."}
{"text":"Extremely slow for early in the morning. Employees are rude and care more about talking to each other than actually helping the costumers. If you ask for something special done to your order, you'll get met with grunts or mean looks."}
{"text":"I hate to dislike this place being that it's so close to home, but the place is always a mess and the staff is always rude. I keep coming back hoping that the service gets better, but it has yet to happen."}
{"text":"The cashier was rude to me and the guest behind me that was trying to inform her the front door was locked. Not helpful.. And there's not that many options for bagel toppings either or at least when I asked her about toppings she seemed so put off by question that I didn't want to inquire further."}
{"text":"I agree with Dani. This Einsteins Bagels is slow! I went here this morning just to pick up a Hate to Wait Basket and I had to wait for the Hate to Wait Basket. First,  I had to wait in a long line until the Bagel Man decided to take the guy's order 3 people ahead of me. Before than he was dilly dallying around throwing bagels in the slicer. Second, it seemed that they were preparing a big order, because I had to wait again until the manager was free to pick the bagels to throw in the basket. Does it really take 3 people out of 5 to prepare one order. 

To top it off, the cashier was making small talk to the police officer in front of me. He was telling him his woes of ringing up the order and how sometimes how he needs to be creative in typing in the order. PLEASE, shut up and let the man pay for his grub!! Don't get me wrong. I like small talk, but not when folks are trying to get their day started."}
{"text":"Hard to find a bagel place open this late in the day, and pretty much the only place that carries chocolate chip bagels."}
{"text":"If the bagels are ready it's fine.  Many times the baker has not shown up or half of the staff has not come to work."}
{"text":"Bagels, sandwiches & employees are awesome!
Tried to get there for days but cannot seem to get my butt up early enough before work to go.
So they made me up my own dozen everything bagels at 3 PM today!!! Soft, fresh and delicious!!

Coffee is fab as well!!!

As for any complains about how slow the line is

Of course it is!!!
So much to decide from!!!!
I get in line and start wanting everything!
(Sorry, guys!!)"}
{"text":"I came here on my lunch break. I walked in and looked at the menu. Already knew what I wanted, the \"shift leader\" was busy discussing hours with an employee standing right in front of me. She didn't even look up and say hello or anything.  Then after a minute or so passed she finally asked what I wanted.  Rude service. Decent food."}
{"text":"In my search for the best bagel in Pittsburgh, I bit the bullet and walked into the Einstein Brothers bagel shop on Greentree Rd, which doesn't show up as existing on Yelp! for some odd reason. But believe me it's there right next to Starbucks and the Olive Garden. 
   
The menu is extensive with breakfast served anytime up until closing at four. I've had many different items on the menu including the eggwhite and turkey sausage breakfast bagel. It's wonderful on the asiago cheese bagel, whole wheat, and the good grains bagel. The turkey rueben excels on pumpernickel bagel and the rye bagel, and is easily the heartiest of the sandwiches. 

     I have a deep seated love of nova lox with all the fixings. Einstein Bros  does it right with a nice schmear of cream cheese, a thin slice of lox, sliced purple onion, tomato, and capers. This is how to enjoy breakfast, and with a cup of their French roast coffee, it's a great way to start the day. Beware, the lox and bagel breakfast can have a whopping 600 calories, I lighten it up by putting it on a bagel thin, and having them use the light cream cheese. Have the bagel toasted.  

After all the tastings I've come to the conclusions that I really like Einstein Bros bagels, especially the good grains bagel. They have great sandwiches, soups, sides and coffee. Oh and a lemon pound cake that surpasses Starbucks!"}
{"text":"Quick stop for a begal, & this place is awsome. Good service n very delicous bagels. Im from Cali & im defenately coming back on my next visit to Las Vegas. Thank you Rudy."}
{"text":"This is the first Einstein's I have been in that just has garlic on their garlic bagel! Love it!!! Every other Einstein's years back started putting sesame seeds on the garlic bagels. That was a frustrating change since I love garlic and strongly dislike sesame. But they are still good enough that I manage to overlook that. Imagine my delight today when I ordered a garlic bagel and it was just that, no sesame seeds. I hope they will all adopt this at all locations in the near future. It makes me a happy girl! =)"}
{"text":"This is a nice treat I allow myself once in a while. I love the garlic bagel. (Truth...I wish Einstein's did not put sesame seeds on their garlic bagel but they added that years ago and I don't think they will ever switch back.)

The service here has always been quick and they almost always give just the right amout of cream cheese."}
{"text":"I admit it.  Having grown up in New Jersey I am a bagel snob.  Since I moved out west, I have been on the never ending search for a bagel that comes close to those crisp outside, soft inside treats you find in NJ and NYC.  At one point I would drive once a month to pasadena from San Diego to buy bagels that were almost as good but that place closed.  

Einstein Bros is not the answer.  Their bagels wouldn't last a minute on any corner in my hometown.  That said, they are a tasty substitute until I find something better.  Their bagels are a bit smaller than I would like and I think they sacrifice quality in order to put out so many varieties.  They pacakge their bagels and schmears well and their lox cream cheese is good.  So far, it is the only place I can get a decent bagel and lox although I am certain someone will recommend another.

The make good breakfast sandwiches and have a nice variety of drinks.  I love the bagel holes they sell.  This location is always busy and clean and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Einstein's they always have fresh bagels the price is fair and reasonable and they have a great selection of bagels also have pretty good coffee and usually a seasonal coffee. The service is always friendly and helpful... Only thing that may bother me is that once they're out of a bagel it's gone they don't make anymore that day and on the weekends that's likely to happen because it gets really packed sometimes the line gets pretty backed up. I'd just advise if you have a craving for a popular gourmet bagel like the Spinach Florentine (My favorite) you better get there early!"}
{"text":"This location used to have slightly better customer service than the other locations which perform absolutely terribly, but not any more.  The service is poor here (with the exception of one girl who is slightly above average) and they aren't even apologetic about it.

Typical situations: over half of the bagels out of stock, forgotten side items, incorrect orders, out of ice, old ice tea, incorrect billings.

Also, on a side note, their new \"fresh cracked\" eggs for the breakfast sandwiches are out of a bag and steamed just like the old sponges they used to sell.  Gross!

The bagels are mediocre which is why I gave 2 stars.  I reserve the 1 star reviews for the truly wretched."}
{"text":"I spend a lot of my hungry time stopping by Einstein's for bagels, etc and have done so for at least eight years. Today I had another great experience. 
Today I had a minor problem. The GM Terry resolved it immediately. All the employees are super friendly. The bagels are always fresh. The bagel sandwiches are unique and really delicious.  I've never had a bad bagel. I would highly recommend if you're in a hungry mood to stop by and pick up something to taste. They have sweets as well, and a new item is lemon poppyseed cake with frosting that is so tasty--not too sweet--and I'm happy to see that it's wrapped now for freshness. Give this location a try.  Thanks to everyone who works there and serves me!"}
{"text":"Ughhhh I usually love einsteins but this one is so horrible!!!!  I got an everything bagel toasted with regular creme cheese and an ice tea my usual. The ice tea was soooo bad I literally thought I was drinking urine. It tasted like it was sitting there for days and I swear I saw mold stuff in it. My bagel was so cold, dry and chewy but in a bad way.  Seriously so nasty. The service was horrible,  took them so long to make the order way longer than the normal expected time. I will not be back here or any Einstein because of this.  How hard is it to make a bagel!  Oh and it barley had any creme cheese on it just chewy cold bread"}
{"text":"Nothing like getting a 20 minute notice that you need to provide coffee and bagels for a 7 am meeting, so off I go to Einstein Bagels!
Definitely kudos for ease of locating a store nearby, lots of locations to pick from and having pre-packs to grab and go. I ended up getting two 13 bagel assorted packs with 4 tubs of shmear (ooh, pumpkin) and a coffee carrier for the group. 
Walk in, door chimes, nobody at counter. Kid restocking straws and forks doesn't flinch. 
Another lady walks in, door chimes. No reaction. 
Another customer walks in, door chimes. ZERO reaction. The three of us get huffy and foot tappy, finally a frazzled girl pokes her head out of the back, alerts the clueless kids to assume the position and they start going through the line. The order/payment process was simple as well as collecting the bagels, but getting coffee and all that together was a process. 
 Longest part of the experience, by far, was getting cups, sugar and creamer together, as I foolishly asked if I can run bagels to my car. That warranted stopping my order from being processed and another customer inserted, so upon returning I had to wait for his drink to be made before I could get my hands on aforementioned cups and such. 
 Now, I totally get this is all my fault- I've previously ordered ahead for meetings via the Einstein website and my experience was ridiculously seamless- walk in, it's all right there ready at requested time, packaged and neat, grab and go. 
 So tip- order ahead. Or get stuck in bagel purgatory."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed with this location. I've been a customer here at least twice a month for 17 YEARS because I live nearby and I absolutely love the food. Over the last few years, I've begun to notice a decline in stock and the last several times I've stopped in, the baskets were empty with maybe 5 selections left and nothing coming fresh out of the oven. They are ALWAYS out of \"everything\" bagels. ALWAYS!!!!! The staff here isn't even friendly, especially compared to the other locations. The Warm Springs/Eastern location is an embarrassment to the Einstein Bros brand. Don't waste your time coming here."}
{"text":"Juicy Italian chicken sandwich!
Coffee also great,too
Fabulous start of my first day in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Ordered a Nova, no caper no onion, toasted. First came out with onion. After it was redone, came back untoasted. Sat down and ate my meal that I paid for prepared wrong. Quality of food was top notch, their food is always on point...low score because they specialize in bagels but can't make an order correct."}
{"text":"Great bagels! The location is a little difficult since its in a hotel and there is only street parking, but since its not too far from my house and they have the bomb bagels I will be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly the worst Einstein's I've been to. Been there twice and my eggs were gray. Not chill"}
{"text":"Be Sure when you order your bagel with butter and cream cheese you \"special request\" this to take place for both sides of your bagel. Not impressed with today's experience @ the Tatum and Shea Einstein Bros. If management is cutting costs and that is the reason for poor service then shame, shame, shame. It'll be Bagels and Bailies next time."}
{"text":"This is the worst run Einstein's. Any time of the day they are out if bagels.  You walk out wondering if you're crazy for expecting a bagel store to have bagels. I've been here during lunch hour and they say the dough is in the proffer.  One time they told me the dough was still frozen."}
{"text":"Einstein's always confuses me. You order at one counter, pay at another, get your cups from someone else in some cases. I just don't get it. At this particular location, you order at the counter immediately to your right. Then you walk past all the food and pay for your order. That doesn't make sense to me at all. The order counter is before the food, but whatevs.

Whatever you get here is guaranteed to be awesome. I personally like the egg and cheese on a jalapeno bagel. Kind of pricey at $4.59 though. Einstein's also has some of the best coffee around. Get the vanilla hazelnut. It's sooooo delicious!"}
{"text":"Even though it was a crazy busy Saturday morning, the service was fast and friendly. Surprisingly my takeout order was ready in only about 5 mins. There was also lots of parking available"}
{"text":"Well visiting Phoenix Arizona and staying at the Hyatt Regency, it was a pleasure to have a nice bagel with some ham and cheese served by very friendly staff. My bagel was very hot and fresh. They serve breakfast and lunch and I think they close at 3:00 PM"}
{"text":"Must be the only coffee place that never has coffee
3 visits in 2 weeks and never have coffee
Unless u drink decaf or vanilla"}
{"text":"I placed a last minute catering order and Lee the General Manager was very helpful in getting that ready in time for my pick up. He included all the utensils and even carried it out to my car for me."}
{"text":"these guys are seriously understaffed and stretched thin on Sunday around 11:30 AM. About 60% of their bagels were gone and was informed that they were not making any more specialty bagels because they were out of dough..... ummm okay..... staff was scrambled and everywhere, customer in front of me ordered a Lox sandwich and It was brought to him with no salmon. really?!!??! cashier did an excellent job keeping it light and professional every single time he had tell someone \"no more specialty bagels....\"

moral of todays visit: come early if you want any specialty bagels, expect to wait anytime, all the time, and CHECK YOUR ORDER!

the 6 bagels that I was able to get were really really good. fresh, soft and chewy. vanilla cold brew was excellent. better than the other coffee giant with the green logo."}
{"text":"Service was extremely fast which was great but fittingly so the bagels were cut very unevenly and spread put on a bit carelessly. 

Maple spread was terrific tho. 

Place is clean and good location."}
{"text":"I guess einstein's has gone down because of the minimum wage hike. I was in there today and my bagel had half of the egg and cream cheese they use to give. I had one bagel with egg and cheese and one bagel with cream cheese and a large OJ which was suppose to be fresh which it wasn't and the cost was $13.63. It was like what? Seems very expsensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Bad service. I asked why there was no iced tea and was told it had run out earlier. I asked if anymore tea was going to be made and was told it would take too long, 20 minutes. When I asked for a refund for the cup that was going to be used for the tea, they quickly refunded the money for the cup and I didn't see them make any tea while I sat there unhappy about not getting my iced tea. They did not care."}
{"text":"Einstein Bagels has been one of my favorites for years. And this location is the one I go to most and I don't think I'll be back.  The past few experiences have been declining.  Long lines, messy dining area, messy food prep area (the employees seem to be bumping into each other a lot).  But this past Sunday did it for me.  As I was ordering I saw one of the food prep employees cough into the air.  Didn't even make an attempt to shield his mouth with his shoulder or even hands and then wash them.  Nothing!  Blech, all those germs just poof into the air!  After reading other's reviews I am curious to see what the health department has on them. I love the menu, I just have to find a different location.  And I agree with other's comments, the combo locations with the Caribo (sp?) company are nothing like the real Einstein."}
{"text":"Don't pay any attention to when they say they close.  That's just when they lock the doors and turn off the registers. 

They stop serving food at some impossible-to-guess randomly-selected time prior to their closing time when they turn off their oven."}
{"text":"I usually love Einsteins.  I love their blackberry lemonade and their six cheese bagels.  However I do not love this location.  It is right around the corner from my house, I do not even have to leave my residential roads to enter here, but I will never go here again.  Why do you ask?  It is because they have the worst customer service ever.  Every time I have been in here (which is about 6-7) they are very rude to me.  I do not know why.  I do not know if they are having a bad day or what but they are extremely unfriendly here, and its not always the same person. They lost my business for good."}
{"text":"It's an Einstein's so you can't expect too much. My usual quality assessment of Einstein's centers on two things since the food is largely consistent across locations. The two things are: (1) quality of service and (2) timeliness, which is especially important since this location is in the airport.

1.) Service: The service at this location is average. One employee, who was preparing food, completely ignored us when we walked up. The lady who was at the register was very nice though; I enjoyed interacting with her. Our order was fairly simple, but we did ask to change the cheese on one sandwich. Unfortunately, this instruction was lost in translation and the final product didn't have the correct ingredients. I also asked for my bagel to be toasted and if it was, I couldn't tell. 

2.) The timelessness was good for an airport. They probably saved time *not* toasting my bagel. We were also the only customers in line so there wasn't a lot happening. 

It was an average experience at an average chain. You pretty much get what you'd expect."}
{"text":"This place is always a hot mess but where else will I go?.... And the customers here make it way harder than it should be.  Why was the lady in front of me yelling because there was a pickle on her plate, NEXT to the bagel? I got my bagels faster than expected."}
{"text":"Love this place.  From the second you walk in you smell the goodness of everything making you crave it all.  The choice of bagels are awesome.  Can't go wrong with any of them.  The iced caramel macchiato is so good"}
{"text":"A favorite place to start and stop our bike rides! Great coffee... good seating!! My friend s like the breakfast offerings... especially the skinny bagels with spinach and eggs. I like that they give senior discounts!"}
{"text":"Probably the standard for bagels in the valley... Meaning if someone in your office \"brought bagels\" they probably came from Einstein.  Ok when toasted and topped with something, bland and too bread like for me when eaten alone. This location seems to get new management every couple of weeks, and the latest iteration seems to have things dialed in... The woman in front of me order about ten things, and then I ordered my single bagel. Oh great, here's a good fifteen minute wait I thought (Einstein runs a strict assembly line system usually, so orders are preped in order, regardless of the inefficiency this can bring). However this time, the staff banged out the massive order very quickly, before I had even gotten my coffee. While this situation was acceptable, too often I've waited for 15 minutes for a non-toasted bagel in the same situation. I realize typical bagel slingers aren't rocket scientists or efficiency experts, but the management should correct this glaring inefficiency. Being fast is about all this place is good for really."}
{"text":"I LOVE Einstein bagels. A LOT. Bet bagels I have had. We live right by this location and go there often but today was my last time I will go to this specific one. It is so dirty. I will give them a break that yes it was Presidents' Day so they were probably busy ... But there was trash on every table, all over the floor, the coffee bar area was disgusting, and the last straw was the gross bathroom. You can tell it had not been cleaned in months. There was so much grime on the sink and the paper towel dispenser I was majorly grossed out. It makes me wonder how clean the kitchen area really was. My order was wrong which Happens no big deal... On top of that I have never had good customer service there- next time I will drive the extra 10 minutes out of my way to the location on Tatum and shea's- they're always friendly and it's very clean there."}
{"text":"I brought a friend here because we had time to kill while his sister was shopping. We each ordered sandwiches off the menu. It doesn't take an Einstein to figure out that they have more than just bagels. So I wanted to review this place based on their sandwiches. My friend ordered a ham and Swiss which he shared with me. I ordered the Nova lox bagel. The Ham and Swiss was made with Ham, Swiss cheese, red onion, lettuce, tomato, Mayo, and mustard, on potato bread. My sandwich was a typical lox and bagel. Perfectly smoked salmon on a plain bagel with capers and cream cheese. 
Both sandwiches were delicious. The counter staff was helpful and polite, contrary to other reviews. The coffee was fresh and very good. They offer a couple different varieties and all the condiments It comes out of a self serve pump canteen. Usually those are Luke warm at best. These were piping hot. We watched the steam roll off the cup while we enjoyed our bagel sandwich.
I saw a wide variety of bagels in the display case. They will have to wait for another visit as the sandwich filled me up."}
{"text":"Happy time at Einstein's Bagels. Yes it is a chain store but that is ok. Had the  Nova Lox with tomato and onion. Generous portion of smoked salmon on a fresh bagel. Bottomless coffee. They do offer a senior discount...but if you dont ask... they won't give it to you."}
{"text":"Recently moved from busy California. They consistently serve me my order in a reasonably timely manner. I don't understand all the other reviews complaining about taking a long time. Of course if you cone in at the peak time, Mr and Ms VIP you'll have to wait longer than Maybe doing something smarter and arrive abit earlier, if your job is so important.  Great bagels. Great people here. Its that simple. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Sold me coffee they were out of, then had to ask the same person three times over the course of about 30 mins before anything was done. For some reason, there was one guy who was doing everything while everyone else took their sweet time/talked to one of their friends in the seating area."}
{"text":"I read a review once where someone who had also recently moved from NY to AZ was stating how you'll always be looking for good pizza, good Chinese food, and good bagels. Well, I've given up on pizza because I've resigned to the fact that good NY pizza can only exist in NY and I've found my NY style Chinese food restaurant (complete with Long Island Chinese food prices no less) but bagels, I'm still holding out. I'm super spoiled in terms of bagels because I used to work a deli (Bagel Biz on 110, what what) where the bagels were made fresh every day and I've literally tried every bagel flavor imaginable - guess what? All delicious! But, I digress. Einstein Bro's has decent bagels, decent enough that I come here at least once a week but this is no NY bagel. These bagels are soft, even after being toasted but the flavor is there and I guess that counts for something. The prices are ridiculous though. You could get at least two egg sandwiches with eggs made on the flat top in NY for the price of one of these very artificial looking egg sandwiches so I've never ordered one, mostly because I'm what? Cheap, I'm damn cheap. And they don't call it cream cheese, it's shmear, which sounds gross but you get past it. I've tried the honey walnut and the regular because I'm too afraid to try anything else but if they come out with pumpkin spice, you bet I'm going to try it. It's the consistency of whipped cream cheese which is my favorite. They don't go overboard with the application so you never have to scrape any off but that's a part of the NY deli nostalgia that I miss. At this location the lines are pretty hit or miss, I've left before because they were understaffed and I had maybe ten minutes to get to work after having already waited ten but I don't fault them for being busy. Today, however, there was no wait and I used my free bagel and shmear (with purchase) coupon to get a toasted pumpkin bagel with regular shmear and a strawberry lemonade. They strawberry lemonades come with lids and as I was getting out of my car, the lid was not secured properly and I spilled lemonade all over myself and my car at 7:20 in the morning so now I'm at my desk, smelling sticky sweet and regretting every bit of my decision. But, all in all, I'm a bagel girl and I'll never stop eating bagels so I guess Einstein Bro's has become a staple in my life. Arizona, you win."}
{"text":"I have been to almost all of the locations in Las Vegas. This one by far is the best of them all. It is clean in here, staff is friendly, food came out fast. This is our go to location."}
{"text":"Always busy here.... Super busy on the weekends. Bring patience with you :) Currently there are 21 people who have ordered, paid and are standing around waiting on food. There is no \"waiting area\" so you'll be in front of the coffee, the soft drink machine and halfway down the hall to the toilet :)
From the time I paid for my food (two bagels, toasted with cream cheese) it was 16 minutes until they put it in my hand."}
{"text":"I feel like everytime I come to this location something always goes wrong whether it be rude ass staff or forgetting about my order completely. Today..... all i ordered was a bagel just 1 pumpkin with pumpkin shmear 
And waited 15 min!! A family of 4 that ordered after me got their food before me. When They finally realized they forgot my order they didnt even offer an apology or even acknowledge that they forgot. Smh"}
{"text":"bad service orders always wrong one person making sandwiches need help asap manager was nice to give me 50%off"}
{"text":"I'm tired of feeling ripped off.  The last 4 times I've gotten a bagel and schmear there, the schmear was so thinly layered on the bagel that you could see through it.  No more.
Now I go to Chompies---It's more expensive and worth every cent.
Forget you Einsteins!"}
{"text":"I go here every two weeks for my office early mornings. I get 2 1/2 dozen bagels. Very fast, Great service, friendly and  they get it right the first time.  Even if there is a line there is never a long wait. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Why do bagel places only cater to early morning patrons? This is Las Vegas and majority of people work nights, therefore breakfast is closer to noon. Every time I come in the selection of bagels are limited (six cheese always gone) and they are not making more. Businesses need to adapt to customer demands and time tables.... Not the other way around.  Production is cheap and the selection should always be full before noon."}
{"text":"Get the asiago cheese bagel with sun-dried tomato cream cheese!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Einsteins in general has mediocre bagels at best, and their \"schmears\" appear to be highly processed.  I've generally given up on Einsteins all together because because their food has really taken a nose dive, as has the service.  I stopped by this location recently because I was driving by and in a hurry, and wanted a bagel (they're supposed be a bagel store after all!).  First, no salt bagels.  Aren't salt bagels one of the standards?  Second, I ordered my bagel with cream cheese (cream cheese being a $1.50 option) to go and that was my real mistake.  Whoever made the bagel didn't even manage to slice all the way through the bagel and put an amount of cream cheese approximately equivalent to a pat of butter on one-half of the bagel.  The other half was basically dry.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I was pretty annoyed when I got to work and opened up my bagel.  Stick to any of the local bagel joints like Chompies or Kashmans - they have much better bagels, and they will dump a brick of cream cheese on them for you."}
{"text":"I went and it's closed it's under construction memorial day today. So I ended up going to Brooklyn bagels and it was OK. They have a buy 6 and get 3 free lady couldn't get me 12 and 6 free . So I got six. And three free . She should of done it I would've bought more of their cream cheese and drinks hahaha. Einstein beagle were are youuuuuu!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to this location for lunch around 10:30 am 8/9/17. Ordered an everything bagel with cream cheese and a firehouse sandwich (on the picture) or something sounding like that as well as a cup of coffee. Okay, went to get half and half, empty. Went to get coffee lid, empty. Went to get napkins, empty. All at the same time! Everyone seemed busy cooking and at checkout, maybe they were short staffed? I could see at least three people working. The food was okay, have had better at other locations. Service could be more welcoming being that everything else fell short. Maybe more training, time managment, more staff? Something!"}
{"text":"While staying in Tempe I'll periodically drop by here for a bite to eat.  The place is always clean. The staff is here is always enthusiastic, friendly and just makes you feel like a welcomed friend.  Food and drinks are great and it's always refreshing top stop here."}
{"text":"went recently because we had some gift cards.  my husband's traditional lox and bagel on an everything bagel looked very good.  Flavored coffee was excellent.  I had a 9-grain bagel w/ pb and j.  it was good as well.  I did ask the man at the counter if he could suggest something different and he just shrugged and said it's all good.  afterward I realized I could have had a \"healthier\" choice w/ an egg white, mushroom and asparagus combo."}
{"text":"We have been going to Einstein's for a very long time. It's very convenient and friendly staff. I love that they have young employees with management that are growing these young people. The hospitality industry is a great thing to learn for our children, builds character and teaches them a lot about themselves. Way to go Einstein's management for being great leaders and giving great hospitality. Plus the bagels are awesome !"}
{"text":"Great service today. Enjoying an iced coffee. This place has \"endless\" coffee. 5 flavors to choose ftom. There is also a variety of sandwiches,  breakfast and lunch.  You can also order expresso answer latte."}
{"text":"I went here on the way to the airport for Thanksgiving.  The guy in front of me was having a conversation with the cashier ringing up the orders (very inconvenient), so I voiced my concern and demanded their sense of urgency.  Had they not responded to it, I would've given them 2 or 3 stars.  The fact that they went right ahead and helped their customers is pretty awesome.  It's hard to ditch a regular who is trying to schmooze with the employees, and they are very friendly people who work at Einstein.

I get the Nova Lox Everything bagel--it's lox, cream cheese, tomatoes, onions, capers (you can easily take them off haha) on an everything bagel.  Yum.  It's too bad it's like SEVEN BUCKS!  But, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I love Einstein bagels. But this location is horrible! I try to avoid it because every time I go in there they never have a good selection of bagels. They are always out of chocolate chip bagels and that is my kids favorite. Today they told my husband they were out of everything bagels but there were some in the back that they had to go get one. (to their annoyance!) To top it off, they are so stingy on their cream cheese. I'm paying for the stuff so put it on like all the other stores! Unless I say light in the cream cheese I expect to see the cream cheese on my bagel! I even took a picture to prove the lack of cream cheese! I have given this store lots of chances and I'll go to another one now no matter what my location. Sorry but too many other options out there!"}
{"text":"Great service here! Sat outside and he brought us our order! Two hot egg and bacon sandwiches, they even put the butter on my bagel! Not like other places where the butter is in a packet- very cold- and hard to spread. I feel like these chains don't get enough credit, but this location stands out!"}
{"text":"Customer service is bad. The \"lead\"employee, Mike and the employees do not read the instruction. I am not even sure why they were bothered to type additonal information in the computer when they DID NOT read the instruction. The place is meh, nothing special, i have seen better Einstein bagel. BUT do not take my word for it, check other reviewers. They all mentioned worst customer service. If i can give -5 I would. The food itself taste blend and burnt. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Smiling employees, great food and quick service. I will be back to this location forsure!"}
{"text":"It is clearly advertised on the door of this location that they have a Baker's dozen for $7.00 on Mondays. So my husband went over to get bagels for us. My husband went over to the store at 1130 this morning. Jordan, the manager of this location advised him that for 13 bagels (9 cinnamon raisin, 2 Blueberry, and 2 chocolate chip) that it would be 40 minutes. Jordan's excuse when asked why so long was, \"we don't know what you're going to want, you should have called first\". This is a bagel shoppe that serves bagels and can't fulfill an order without being notified first. My husband even asked if they could substitute an item for the 2 chocolate chip bagels because that was all that was waiting to fulfill the order, Jordan's response was \"nope, we can't substitute nothing\" my husband also called the local complaint line and they were just as rude. Stay classy Einsteins! Well be steering clear of this and all locations for a while."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Einstein's. However, the airport location needs help. The wait was long and they were disorganized. They need process and procedures. I know Einstein's management will do the right thing and help these folks out."}
{"text":"We had a delayed flight which got cancelled but I stopped here because I was so hungry! I got the roasted veggie tostini they didn't have anymore bread so I got to choose Asiago bagel, I must say that was the best sandwich I have ever had!! So delicious I'm not sure what cheese they used but my god that was soo freaking good!!! I'm going to try to replicate it"}
{"text":"Need a good cup of coffee? Are you tired of Starbucks, Peets, Seattle's Best, or the other designer brands of coffee?

May I suggest a strong cup of dark roasted coffee from Einstein Bros. Bagels! Ummmmmmmm, what a right way to start your day! Yay!

I was waiting at catch a flight out to San Jose when I decided to get something to eat from a burrito joint within the McCarran airport. 
The burrito joint sold food & coffee, but the funny thing about the burrito joint, they don't make coffee (I'm glad). They sold me the cup for coffee, and told me I had to go across the way to a place called Einstein Bros. Bagel to get my coffee.

Lucky for me.........I think the burrito joint did me a big favor, as I've never had Einstein Bros. coffee before. 
I must say the coffee was rich & flavorful! I enjoyed it so much I managed tank down 3 cups of this coffee before I jumped on my flight out to San Jose! I wished we had Einstein Bros. in Hawaii......"}
{"text":"They messed up my order again for the 3rd time in a row. It's not hard to toast a bagel..."}
{"text":"When it comes to bagels, the various types of cream cheese based spreads to put on them, and some good coffee to wash it all down with, it does not get much better than Einstein bagels.  This location gets pretty busy on weekend mornings, but weekdays are a breeze.  It is less than a mile from my house, so definitely one of my fave places to go for carbs."}
{"text":"I'm finally getting around to writing a review for Einstein. Had a craving for bagels and when I got there, no more bagels....was told that I needed to wait 20 minutes before the bagels were ready.  This was at 10 am.  I will not be returning to this Einstein."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best bagels I have had. The chorizo sunrise. Super spicy but so good"}
{"text":"My gf and I came to this location around 7am on Sunday 6/25/17 and ordered two bagel breakfast sandwiches with cream cheese (which you naturally have to pay extra for).  The employees seem to not even care about their jobs or customers and I would likely blame it on culture or management.  They gentleman whom took our order not even really paying attention came across like it didn't matter - maybe they don't realize customers attribute to their salary by power of voting minimum wage hikes, tips etc. To no surprise we opened our Togo bag only to find the bagels lacked bacon and cream cheese!  Trying to see if I can post pictures.  I'd stay away from this location or if you go check your food if you get it to go Bc the staff are incompetent."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. Opened up almost 20 mins late. No speciality coffees avail, no plain creamcheese, the bacon, avacodo & egg they didn't have either. You're better off not even going to stand in line, they probably won't have what you really want. Go to Starbucks instead, friendlier service & they had my mocha."}
{"text":"Restaurant review
I think this place has too high of a star rating. I have driven by this location many times and never stopped in for food before. I finally came out here for lunch with the family. The server was friendly and took our order quickly, however the food itself somehow took forever to come out. The chicken pesto sandwich was nothing special and should take minutes to make, however after 15 minute we finally got our lunch. My wife's chicken noodle soup was somehow lukewarm and slightly cold as well. I have no idea why it too so long to make something so simple.

{"text":"This is new Einstein location. The service is friendly and fast. Bagels are fresh and sandwiches are yummy. I like the $6 dozen bagel Mondays. The restaurant is clean as well. I had to take off one star because they always run out of my favorite bagel...potato. I'd highly recommend."}

They are very friendly and this makes the place stand out and become a place you look forward to going to."}
{"text":"I love this Einstein location. 
 I have been here quite a few times during my AZ visits and have never had a single complaint or ill experience. Its honestly great, reliable, and delicious. 
  For starters, the customer service here is awesome. The employees seem to be working efficiently and always greet me kindly. They consistently get the order as directed and the wait is never long ( even when there has been a lot of people ) .
  The quality of the food is exceptional. The bagels always taste freshly made. I recommend the blueberry bagel, however, my dad would suggest the spinach ( yes i guess they have  spinach bagels ).
The vanilla hazelnut coffee gives you a kickstart to a great and perky day. Totally recommend trying it ( its not too sweet) .
 I consistently get the same order here so all other items you'll have to discover for yourself but I can assure you that this location is an awesome representation of Einstein Bagels co. 
Thanks!"}

{"text":"When I was still a 'burbs baby working at the neighborhood mall - I thought Einstein's was the bomb.  I thought they had the best bagels in the world.  I thought it was sooo cool that I could get a salad and a coffee drink at the same time.  The one that was between my house and my mall had this awesome big solid wood table that could sit 6 easily and it was my favorite thing in the world to hang out at that table w/ my bagel, random coffee drink and the newspaper spread all over the place.  

Here's the thing.  I didn't know any better.  I wasn't wrong to like what I liked - but I was wrong to think they were quite as great as they were.  What did I know about independent coffee shops?  I should have realized that the black and white photos all over the place were just as corporate as the faux-antique newspaper crap all over the inside of the neighborhood Subway.  But they were in frames and somehow that made them different.  

As I've gone new places and tried new things, I've still occasionally eaten at an Einsteins.  Folks bring bagels into the office.  I'm looking for a better than drive through salad in a hurry and it's nearby.  And it's never been \"bad\".  Problem is, it hadn't been really great either.  It's fine.  It totally gives you what you order.  But nothing more.  

I went to one recently and found that it's menu had again almost completely changed since I'd been in last.  I ordered a chicken sandwich and an iced tea.  I chose a Caesar salad as my side.  Salad = 1/1/2 stars.   Not good. Sandwich was 3 stars.  Totally just ok and nothing more.  Interesting flavor - but quickly forgettable.  I do like their green tea.  But for almost $9 for a sandwich and an iced tea I found myself thinking about how much better I could have done.  

Bagels for the office - fine.  Go for it.  They'll even pre-cut them which I think is a great option.  And they almost always have my fav (pumpernickel) available which gives them bonus points.  But for lunch?  Unless you're really having a very specific craving that, for some bizarre reason, only they can fill - keep driving."}
{"text":"This place is great, they have a wide variety of healthy items on the menu to choose from and they open early. David is always friendly and remembered my name after only meeting me once.  This is where I go for breakfast almost everyday now."}
{"text":"This place is filthy.  I ordered before I looked around.  As I have been here for 10 minutes at 10am and not one staff member has cane to clean a table and the bathrooms are disgusting. Go to the one at Chandler and 101"}
{"text":"Ordered two Farmhouse egg sandwiches this morning and they were made quickly and were super fresh. The workers were very nice and pleasant. I've always thought that Einstein's prices were kind of steep but it's not like I come here that often anyways but it's decently filling bagel sandwiches and would stop by here again if I was craving it."}
{"text":"I came in for breakfast this morning and ordered the Bagel and Lox. The bagel itself was fantastic - the best bagel I have had in Pittsburgh - but the toppings were not as tasty. I'm not sure whether it was the tomato or the salmon, but it tasted as if one of them had recently come out of the freezer (or at a minimum an extremely cold fridge). This really ruined the whole meal. If I come back, next time I will just order a bagel and cream cheese.

On the plus side, the service was great, but some of the other patrons were a little rough (loud and seemingly unaware that they were not alone in the restaurant)."}
{"text":"If I'm in vegas, and its saturday, that means its family breakfast at Einsteins. I love this place. The variety, the pleasant staff, the tea that is always so nice and strong to keep me motivated.

I'm a bagel guy, i love me unique flavors of bagel and spread. Same goes for my mom, dad on the other hand is a plain with plain... maybe jelly if you harass him enough.

My all time favorite is the asaigo cheese with honey almond smear. Although mom got me hooked on her latest creation. Its the cinnamon crunch sliced and toasted with butter. Tastes just like the cinnamon toast my granny would make in the oven when i was a kid. Mom remembers it that way to, so somehow they are able to replicate it, Mom time to pick up your game!

I haven't had any of the coffee, but my girlfriend Beth has. She said it was good and drank it all. The yogurt it ok, im not a fan of the bagel bites."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been a weekly (at least!) staple for our family.  The service is always great and food perfect every time.  Kudos to management for running a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever...by 10AM they were out of the majority of bagels and it look over 25 minutes to get three toasted bagels with cream cheese!  Will not be back!!  Knew I should have went to bagel nosh!!!"}
{"text":"It's funny, I have been drinking Starbucks for years. Then I switched to Dutch brothers. After that I started drinking Tullys   
But now I discovered Einstein brothers. They have the best espresso in town, without a doubt. The bagels don't suck either."}
{"text":"I like their bagel sandwich, both tasty and healthy!
I tried the NEW honey smoked salmon, much better than Nova Lox I think"}
{"text":"They are way understaffed. Staff is nice, but it's apparent they are stressed and not totally sure what they are doing."}
{"text":"The bagel was very basic, made very sloppy by a very rude man. I asked for light cream cheese, he gave me regular cream cheese which is easy to tell as there is a significant difference in the taste (I even asked him if he used light cream cheese and he lied and said yes). When I paid I was surprised at the price, I commented to my boyfriend 'oh wow $8.50 for a bagel, but I did get lox' I didn't mean it rudely I was honestly just a little surprised but the man making the bagel overheard and gave me and my boyfriend an incredibly rude look and shook his head. It was an unpleasant and awkward interaction overall and the bagel was too basic and overpriced for me to enjoy, recommend or return for more."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their egg sandwiches are incredible and everyone here is so nice and courteous! They give awesome suggestions and I use them for catering all the time! You can sign up for their email list and they send a ton of coupons! I love their Tasty Turkey and all the new hot egg sandwiches are delicious! The best ones I think are the Peppered Bacon Melt and Santa Fe but honestly everything is great here and always fresh. They also have the best coffee around. One of my favorite spots for breakfast hands down!"}
{"text":"I don't often put reviews on Yelp but I will in this case. I have tried this place several times. The first was a good experience: close to home and had coffee and bagels. The manager was friendly and we enjoyed ourselves. The last two times have been poor. I don't think the same manager is here anymore and the quality of service has suffered. 

The same manager, a gentleman whose name I forget, told me on our first visit to call ahead to get hot fresh bagels. So on my last visit I decided to do just that. I was told they were just made and would be ready in 10 minutes. I drove over and was greeted with my box of bagels. 

I opened the box to check the selection and all of the bagels were ice cold. My issue here is that I called in to request hot fresh bagels, not bagels that have been sitting for a while. 

I asked the staff why the bagels were cold and they said they were from the bins.

So I asked about the process to call ahead and they confirmed you can do it. So I spoke with the employee that took my order and she said \"oh you mean you wanted hot hot bagels?\" She also told me that they would take 20 minutes to bake not the initial 10.

I asked to speak with a manager who told me that the process takes an hour. So I asked why her employee told me 10 minutes on the phone and that they were just made. She said nothing to acknowledge that. I was frustrated and told her she needs to train her staff with the correct information because I would be more than willing to wait the hour for hot out of the oven bagels and drive over.

I was then told it would be another 20 minutes and I waited. 

The bagels in this place are adequate now and I cannot recommend it based on the lack of customer service, misinformation and a general lack of care for the clients.

For my money I'll drive to Chompies to get bagels as they stick by their guarantee of quality and customer service."}
{"text":"Great coffee and good bagels especially when you get a coupon for by 1 sandwich get 1 free. Just don't try the one with salmon on it...that was not tasty at all and I love fish."}
{"text":"I always have a good experience with this einsteins. The staff is very friendly and thorough. The parking can be a pain in this lot especially if you are there on a weekend morning. The location is also very convenient however!"}
{"text":"Chain's are always tricky to review.  I find everything about this spot to be adequate-  the location is right next to the convention center so you can get a cheaper breakfast here, the coffee is adequate, the bagels are adequate, and it does exactly what it needs to do.  

Very often I am eating just to sustain my life, and to avoid my crippling disease of Hanger.  Einstein Bros satisfies that craving, nothing more, nothing less.  So here is an adequate review for an adequate experience.  

3 Stars for a bulls-eye of adequacy"}
{"text":"I ordered a pumpkin muffin that had a swirl of frosting on top and when asked if I'd like it warmed, said yes. What I received was a burning liquid mess in a bag to-go. 

When I agreed to have it \"warmed up\", I did not expect it to sit for 5 minutes on high in the microwave. The frosting was  a puddle in the bag that could barely be touched, and the rest of the muffin so hot that it could not be eaten. 

I was also very disappointed in the breakfast sandwiches I ordered. They were flat, with few ingredients, and though I know it may not look like their glamorous pictures, are not like they were before."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place get some negative reviews for customer service.  I've been here a few times and the service is always fast and friendly.  However, the bagels don't look or taste as good as usual today.  

And they screwed up in my order in a truly bizarre way giving what can only be described as a garlic-sesame bagel, instead of a garlic bagel.  What makes that weird is that (1) I've never seen a garlic-sesame bagel in my life and (2) they don't even have garlic-sesame bagels on the menu.  It's as if the guy making the garlic bagels accidentally dropped them in the sesame seeds and didn't look back.  

I drove 4 miles to get here today, since I've liked this store in the past, but would not do so again."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service..not so much. Had to wait to order our food as no one was at the counter and when we ordered our drinks they took forever to make."}
{"text":"Good local deli. Solid food & ok service. Big turnover of help & mgrs & pkg tricky. Overall recommended but get there early."}
{"text":"My most recent visit was made Amazing with the help of the store Assistant Manager on duty Debra.

She is a real delight to work with and took care of my dozen bagel dilemna. 

This location is Awesome, great staff and fresh bagels! 

Debra is the Rock Star of the show! Thank you"}
{"text":"Rock hard Panini- nasty. They messed up or order a tad but the GM- Rich,was super friendly about it and took care of it. Regardless of who is at fault, being pleasant about it makes a huge difference between \"never again\" and \"repeat business.\" But I won't go back"}
{"text":"the service is good. the food is OK but i would never *crave* anything from here. i got a breakfast bagel which was pretty tasty but they didn't toast it so it was just cold. and the coffee here imo is not worth getting at all. i took a few sips and that was it."}
{"text":"I am new to the area. And Einstein Bros is not in Cincinnati as far as I know. Before this I have only had it once in DC and liked it. But they have pretzel bagels. And pretzel bagels are my favorite kind. It takes the best of both worlds, the pretzel world and the bagel one. And I love their cream cheese. It is light and fluffy. Plus it actually fills me up. As far as service and other conditions of the place. Eh I never been too bothered to notice. The guy who takes my orders now remembers my name, which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Giving 5 stars to balance the other reviews.  Every visit the order has be tasty, correct, and fast.  For the price and fornat what do people expect?"}
{"text":"Usually come here right before work. Ive come to realize that I need to get here at least 20-25 mins prior. They get pretty busy. Love the spinach and bacon flourentine. My favorite! Its a must try. One egg, spinach, bacon, cheese, with tomato spread on a spinach florentine bagel. Yummy!"}
{"text":"This Einstein's has been here for years and it's always reliably good bagels, bagel sandwiches, decent service, and darn good coffee.  I like some of their new menu additions in recent years such as the spinach frittata."}
{"text":"Horribly slow service here, except when the really tall guy is working.  Hummus was disgusting with huge chunks of chickpeas in it.  Any degree of complexity in the egg & cheese bagel order and they seem to manage to screw it up.  Who would have thought swiss is so complicated vs. american cheese?"}
{"text":"New Sourdough bagel is a good idea, and fairly tasty.  Service was fast, efficient, polite, and food was fine.  Decent parking.  Easy to find location.  Prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Painfully slow service here and then discovered they got our small, simple order wrong.  Staff not very polite either.  Won't be back.  Much better bagel place on the other side of the highway by Four Peaks brewery."}
{"text":"Tight parking here with the Albertsons traffic & carts.  Reasonable line wait times, though staff isn't fully trained with the slightest menu modifications.  If the menu says Egg & Cheese bagel sandwich, they shouldn't freak out if I want pepper jack instead of the American/Cheddar default.  Prices seem to be going higher at Einstein's in recent years and now it feels like a premium over fast food places, donuts, and almost a direct competitor to a sit down meal at IHOP or similar."}
{"text":"Convenient location in Sprouts shopping center on southeast corner Scottsdale road and Pinnacle Peak.  New, clean, fast, and very friendly staff.  Enjoy it before word gets out and it's too busy or has bad service like the Shea & 90th location."}
{"text":"Located NE corner of Thunderbird & 59th avenue, attached to the Starbucks.  Einsteins is fairly consistent for a good variety of bagel & bagel sandwiches, and as they say... \"darn good coffee\".  Fresh squeezed orange juice is good as well, and I don't mind the hefty price tag now that everyone is charging $3 for OJ even if it's from concentrate.  Prices aren't bad but the lines can be long during the morning, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Their breakfast sandwich is BOMB. I love that they have turkey sausage, not many places give you the option. I also love being able to pick my own bagels. The customer service is hit or miss but the food is always good"}
{"text":"My review isn't really about the store, but towards the manager, Wendy. No matter when I go in there, she is always is such a great mood and makes you feel that you are the only person she has to help. Makes everything better..."}
{"text":"So apparently this location is closed to remodel which is totally fine. Upgrades are great. But how about letting your customers know that the location is temporarily closed??? Drove all the way here and even called before hand. Not even a message on the voicemail that said they weren't open....."}
{"text":"My work colleague and I were at the airport for a layover on our way to California.  We were starving.  He asked what I wanted, and I said what I'd really like was an Einstein's bagel and schmear but that I would take almost anything. Lo and behold - an Einstein's RIGHT in front of our gate!

So Einstein's are all pretty much same, unless they're horrible.  This one was fine - the line was long, but it was 7:00 am in an airport, so what do you expect? The food was actually really fast to come out!"}
{"text":"Breakfast bagels were awesome. Good variety.

Service was slow, they were hiring i guess so i wont put a negative point on this."}
{"text":"Good bagels, but were running super low when I went in this morning. I didn't get all what I wanted and craved :("}
{"text":"Sunday morning and they are out of half the bagels, took 25 minutes for 3 bagels and half the orders had mistakes!  Management needs to overhaul this location- staff are unprepared and disorganized.  

Go to another location"}
{"text":"I like that I can get an iced coffee and get my own refills. I also really like the sun dried tomato schmear. Beyond that, I kind of hate this place. It's always small and crowded, often having to weave around people constantly to get my order, go to the table, wait in line to get creamer, etc. It's just annoying how crowded this place is. They also seem to not be capable of keeping some types of bagels in stock, even on busy weekends. Then, you have the poor attitude of the rude kids behind the counter. It's just frustrating coming here, so we avoid it and choose other less mainstream joints."}
{"text":"First time at this location. I wish there were more people like Carlos working in customer service. I always ask questions right before I order something- bad habit. But Carlos didn't seem bothered by it at all, he actually seem genuinely happy to help. Thanks for my delicious chi latte !"}
{"text":"Love the food but I've been here twice and both times they've forgotten something! The first time it was potato salad and this time it was pickle. Very nice and courteous staff though."}
{"text":"Kids working behind the counter yelling back and forth to each other and messing around. Two stood there jabbering while the one at the register had to repeat her question 3 times because she kept getting distracted. VERY dirty floors. Cups of stuff laying around behind the counter everywhere. As the girl went to put the milk back and close the refrigerator with her foot, a can of whipped cream fell out. She pushed it around with her foot trying to lift it back in to the fridge. I think she remembered that I was standing there and finally bent over and picked up the can. She wiped it with a rag sitting on the counter and shoved it back in. She handed me my coffee and I left. Straight into the garbage with that $3.00+ drink. Who knows how dirty her hands were or if the cups had been shoved back onto the counter after falling. Yuck."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst place I have ever eaten at. 

I wasted room in my stomach for this crappy bagel
This is my very first experience with this place and I will never ever ever ever ever ever come back here.
The bagel was soggy as hell, and the eggs were microwaved really really really poorly."}
{"text":"Ugh! I hate the fact that when I got home to feed my family of six a bagel for breakfast this morning that there was only 5 bagels in my 1/2 dozen box.  I seriously should count the bagels each time before I leave this place.  Even better, would be if they had it set up where you could pick your own bagels for the customers who want a quick grab and go.  The bagels are always so good, but the business efficiency and efficacy is not."}
{"text":"I love Einstein's! This location has always been clean, efficient, and friendly.

Cinnamon raisin bagel with honey almond shmear is one of my faves!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy my food!

I usually have three go to options.... depending on my desire that day.... 
- a cinnamon raisin bagel with honey almond smear
- garlic bagel with reduced fat cream cheese and lox
- an applewood bacon with egg breakfast sandwich on a garlic bagel

I LOVE iced coffee, but I hate to say that I am not a big fan of Einstein's iced coffee, it just doesn't have a great flavor to me. Although I do enjoy their hot coffee selection and always choose the vanilla hazelnut!

This location always seems packed, but the staff is very quick and always provides great friendly service!"}
{"text":"There used to be a Bruegger's Bagels right on the corner of my neighborhood and now that it is gone I miss it dearly. Instead, I visit this Einstein's... mainly because it is still close and on my way to work. Their bagels are decently made with the proper texture (unlike Chompies that just taste like bread - yuck!) but I do have a problem with the fact that a lot of the different varieties taste pretty similar. I think they use the same dough for almost all and then just \"dip\" them in something to make them a unique offering. Also, I don't know if it is the way they cook them or store them or what but sometimes there is some cross-pollination of flavors as well. I once got a cranberry bagel with a strong garlic taste to it... gross! Their cream cheeses make up for it, though, all the flavors are really good and they are almost all low-fat. One thing I do avoid here is the breakfast sandwiches. The eggs they use are disgusting! They must be either frozen for a long period of time or else powdered and re-constituted or something because they are definitely not real eggs. I mean, even the egg in the Egg McMuffin tastes better. 

I agree with the other reviewers that they tables are none too clean and on the singular occasion that I visited the ladies room I turned around and walked out immediately since it was so filthy. However, since I usually get my food to go, this is not a problem for me. I have never experienced the slow service that they are referring to. I usually arrive around 9am and there is very rarely a line. They have a system where one person takes orders and then you move down the line and someone else runs your card or takes your money. So, it is pretty quick service. And my bagel (toasted with cream cheese) is always in my hands by the time I have finished filling up my coffee cup. (Their self-serve coffee is excellent but don't bother with the caps or lattes, they are not worth the $$). I actually frequently stop here when I am running late for work because it is faster to pick up a bagel and eat it in the car then it is to eat cook something or even eat cereal at home."}
{"text":"This place is very Nice. I am a regular customer here. My daughter works in the neighborhood. So, I am there after I drop her off to work enjoying my coffee with the free refills. Customer service is great here. As I drink my coffee and do my crossword puzzles I watch. I see a staff of all-stars going that extra mile to give their customers a top quality visit.  The beautiful African-American woman and my main man Dylan are fantastic examples of this great staff. Area Business Manager Mary Jo is doing a superb job of developing an exemplary group of customer service professionals."}
{"text":"This is always nice for a quick nosh.  Good for when you aren't in the mood for a big breakfast but feel a little peckish.  The nice thing about Einstein Bros is the wide assortment of bagels.  I always look and look and end up with my favorite - an everything bagel toasted with a shmear.  It is perfect for a nice light brunch.  I get a mocha as well and enjoy sitting in the store smelling the baking bagels and brewing coffee while I read.  It is also a fantastic place to people watch too.  I enjoy the courteous staff who are always very helpful and cheerful.  The store is kept clean and that is really nice.  It is a nice addition to the center that is there.  A nice change from the nearby Starbucks and the Dunkin Donuts across the street.  A little piece of NYC in AZ."}
{"text":"Used to eat a chicken salad bagel with everything and coffee here a few years ago and drove by and with mouth watering stopped by to have one - maybe 40 percent less chicken salad than in the past and the culture and ambiance just seemed dormant -  people were taking orders and serving and going through the motions but it seemed lifeless - the self serve coffee area had run over coffee on the counter and used sugar packets and straws on the counter maybe 5 tables or countertops not cleaned from past patron just seemed like a ship without a rudder - odd to see a chain without consistency and not cleanly - very surprised - sandwich tasted very good and price was fair"}
{"text":"Very poor service often run out of popular bagels and while the next batch is cooking you'll need to choose something else - average servers - could offer so much more value"}
{"text":"this store is dirty and they have a problem getting the order right.
but mostly, this place needs a deep clean, paint, new floors."}
{"text":"I am going yo give this place a 1 star just because they dont have their sh#$ together.  As a business owner i take care of my customers and to have a 2.5 rating on line is absurd. Get your act together !"}
{"text":"I've been to this Einstein's three time in a month. The first time the girl behind the register we rude and no one who worked here seemed happy. I thought I would try it again thinking it was that particular day or one person that made my experience miserable.  The second time was no different. No one there would great you with a smile and spoke as though I was an idiot. The third time I stopped was only out of convenience. Again, this place is such a disappointment. Einstein's needs to take note and change this culture or I'd say they will loose more customers than just me."}
{"text":"Ordered a toasted lox bagel to go.  Wasn't toasted, no creamed cheese!  Are you kidding me??? Who's asleep at the wheel here!??"}
{"text":"I love this location! My order is always correct and there is one particular lady that works in the morning time who is so sweet and always ask how your day is going and calls you sweet names. My favorite location if you need a good quick bite!"}
{"text":"Bagel sandwiches are just A-Ok - they are actually pretty bland.  I had the black forest ham, egg & cheese breakfast sandwich on a wheat bagel and I tasted nothing.  The bagels with schmear, though, on the other hand are pretty good.  They have the new pretzel bagel that my son ate - it was really good, but I did have to scrape off some of the salt that was overloaded on it.  Go here for the bagels and schmear, go elsewhere for the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Once upon a time this used to be the place to go before good coffee and bagel shops opened in Phx. I used to love their coffee 15 years ago but it seems mediocre these days. I have been to this location several times since I move into the neighborhood several months ago. 

The coffee was cold or lukewarm each time and the food is microwaved and mediocre. I can't say anything horrible about it but it is not great either. For the price you can get breakfast better elsewhere but it will do if you are in a rush.  Not sure why the food and coffee are never hot enough. The service seems great. The staff here are very friendly. Add a star for service if you want. The bagels are not that great either. However, I do have to say in my opinion, none are in Arizona. 

The store is too small. It is not big enough to accommodate their customers. It is a bit stressful eating here. The tables are too few and too close together. You can not even walk by a table with a purse on your shoulder without bumping into someone or begging that a cup of coffee does not end up in your lap. 

Also, why is a Starbucks right next door? Knock out a wall and let one of them absorb the other."}
{"text":"I've had Einstein Bros on numerous occasions, bu I've never had anything aside from basic bagels and shmear. I was craving bagel and lox so I met my OG Ryan B for some lunch. 

The service was standard, but I got exactly what I was looking for in a bagel and lox with the works. A little on the expensive side, but I was extremely satisfied with my meal and the atmosphere was nice to sit and chat in a quiet location. Free Wi-Fi and free refills makes this a nice quiet place to get some work done as well."}
{"text":"Service was poor..! THE ONLY REASON I still gave 3 stars was because the food was so amazing!!

If the people working acted like they wanted to be there I would've given 4 stars.. & if they had more food in stock they would have gotten 5 stars!

I simply can't refuse the taste though. So freakin delicious!!! 

I'll be back.. not in a hurry do to service. But I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Free wifi, friendly staff, very clean. Tasty coffee."}
{"text":"A very crowded location but good bagels.  I went there to pick up large amounts of coffee and bagels twice now and once it was fast, easy, quick and I was able to get what I needed without hassle.  The second time, not as much, as they had run out of coffee, which was unexpected.  They went as fast as possible but there was a bit of a wait and others around me were also waiting for their individual orders for a bit too long, especially when many needed to get to work.  If I try here again, I will give myself some time."}
{"text":"My wife and I go here about once a month and more often when the weather is nice. We prefer to sit outside since we usually take our dog with us and it is quite in their outside seating area. There is some traffic noise but never enough to interrupt a nice conservation. 
We usually just get a bagel and a cup of coffee. Their coffee, I prefer the Neighbor hood blend, is  much better than the coffee shop they share their building with. 
This is a place that can get crowded in the mornings. Be prepared to sit on the concrete wall out back or take it with you. 
Love their bagels and coffee and some time away from the house where you can relax and talk."}
{"text":"It was more than $10 for a bagel sandwich with chips and a small fountain drink.  

Excuse me?  I could make ten turkey sandwiches for that price!  

Hardly worth it, even though the bagel was a tasty six cheese bagel. 

Yes, I realize you pay more at a restaurant for something than you do when you make it at home. But this sandwich wasn't a monster sandwich like you'd find at Chompie's. It was an average, lonely little sandwich in a basket that could fit two more just like it. 

The order taking employee didn't bother to mentiom there was an upcharge to use a cheese bagel. They just asked what kind of bagel I would like. 

For an extra 70 cents, I would have stayed with whatever bagel the sandwich came with. I assume it would have been plain, but who knows?

I used to love Einstein's.  And yes, they make good bagels.  But I won't be returning for lunch anytime soon.

A better local alternative is Capriotti's.  A $10 sandwich there is fresh, amazing, and could feed me for two meals. 

I will visit Einstein's again, but only for a bagel with butter or cream cheese."}
{"text":"Two bagels, a coffee and a Coca-Cola for the same price as a reasonable meal at a \"regular\" restaurant.  

My bagel was more warmed than toasted, but it was otherwise alright.

I'm pretty sick of chain bagel and pastry shops, but when you're in a hurry... I guess this place is okay.  

Some of the clientele was a little sketchy, but that was to be expected in this location.

Would I return?  Nah."}
{"text":"I really like this Einstein's.  Maybe it's because they work inside a hotel, but the staff here is so much more competent than some other locations.  My order is always correct and I never leave disappointed.  The breakfast bagels are good here and are a pretty decent value.  They are pretty consistent here, but sometimes I get a little shafted on the amount of cream cheese I get and sometimes my bagel is less toasted than I think it should be.  Otherwise, great location!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with everyone else.  There is something seriously wrong with this location.  Maybe it's because they are stuck inhaling the remnants of burnt coffee next door at Starbucks, but they just suck!  They always seem to be out of the bagels we want.  When they actually do have the one I want, like last time, it was burnt on the bottom!  Yuck!  To make things worse, they are really cheap with the cream cheese or any other thing you choose to add to your bagel.  Sometimes, they get really lazy and just put it on the side and make you do all the work!  I really really really hate this location and we only go here as a last resort.  FAIL!"}
{"text":"The service is always pretty good sometimes they are a little slow that's why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars. Unfortunately that do sometimes run out of certain bagels by around 11am, but all in all it's not a bad location a little small and congested but nothing crazy"}
{"text":"I typically am not type to go on here and write a very nasty review, but I had the worst experience at this Eistein's today. Usually, I will make my bagels at home due to the fact majority of bagelry's do not carry a non-dairy option for topping. I am allergic to dairy and therefore cannot eat cream cheese. I decided to go to Einstein's today because I had a craving for a bagel sandwich. Upon walking in, I noticed that this location FINALLY was carrying hummus--an item that had advertised on the menu, but was not actually carried their store. I expressed my excitement to the gentleman at the point of sale, he seemed more than less enthused and in all honesty came off and either hungover or stoned. Despite his lack of liveliness, he was very friendly when taking my order. I ordered the Hummus Veg Out bagel, which comes with roasted red peppers, arugula, spinach, tomato, red onion, hummus and garden shmear. I expressed to him my allergy and that I did not want the cream cheese on the bagel, which I watched him type into the ticket order correctly as \"no shmear\". After waiting an extremely long time for the bagel (it was about 11:30 and we were the only customers in the store) I went home to enjoy the pathetically topped bagel. I had requested the bagel opened faced; half the bagel had 4 leaves of spinach and what appeared to be hummus and the other half had 4 small slices of roasted red pepper, a small bed of flat and crushed arugula, 4 additional spinach leaves, literally 2 rings of red pepper and 2 paper thin slices of tomato. I got home and spent about 5 minutes \"beefing up\" the bagel with more red peppers, spinach, tomato and avocado that I had at my house. Finally I was going to get to eat my bagel! I took a bite and got a mouth of gloppy cream cheese. Now I am sitting here with a mouthful of hives, 7$ wasted and a full bagel thrown in the trash. 

This is not the first time my order has been incorrect or just skimped on toppings. DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION."}
{"text":"Always busy on the Sundays but they get us through quickly.

Always order the blueberry, chocolate chip and cinnamon raisin bagels which are fresh and of course get sliced.

The breakfast sandwiches are also good with egg and sausage.

Look for coupons to save some dough,  ha. Or buy on Monday a baker's dozen for $6."}
{"text":"Been here 2 times this week and wanted chocolate chip bagels and first time there were here and second time just a couple. Wanted to get a baker's dozen but mainly chocolate chip.

Second time I asked are they making more and they said not for a while. You would think if that is one of the best selling ones that you would keep making them"}
{"text":"Staff was very attentive.  I had lox and cream cheese on an asiago bagel.  Just perfect!"}
{"text":"I am happy that the Einstein Bros. Found fit to have pumpernickel bageks and fresh squeezed orange juice on the menu. Really. That is what I want and they deliever. Regularly. In many towns. Simple. Easy. I like it. Thanks"}
{"text":"I love the fact that they have pumpernickel bagels! Sometimes I have to seek them out as there are no pumpernickel bagels to be found within 50 miles of my home. So I say Thank You to the Brothers for the Pumpernickel! Clean Fast Fresh - YUM"}
{"text":"Their gourmet bagels are amazing. I tried the jalapeno cheddar and the green chilli. I would eat these bagels everyday if the store was closer to my apartment. You cannot miss the tasting these bagels."}
{"text":"It's an Einstein's and it's at school.  The food is OK.  The coffee is OK.  I basically come here because it's on campus and it's convenient.  I usually end up with a bagel thin sandwich and a signature coffee, and my bill ends up around $10.  

The bagel sandwiches are hit or miss.  Sometimes they are well put-together and taste good.  Other times my sandwiches are sloppy and lack flavor.  The service could use some refinement.  But like I said, it's at school and it's convenient."}
{"text":"The bagels are good, but the service is consistently below average. The last two times I've gone there, there is one girl taking orders and accepting payment. It's been busy both times I've gone in. 

Last time I had to wait for her to take about 6 orders before I could pay. I already HAD my bagel. Today she took an order before mine that was about 6 people, then two other people came after me that we're able to pay before I was able to. 

So after all of this, both times, a manager I'm assuming comes out to help. They need more people in the mornings to make it flow better. It shouldn't take 10 minutes to order and pay for one bagel."}
{"text":"This has been my best experience here so far. They have been out of bagels and coffee early morning several times. Not today! Friendly warm smiles & service-delicious coffee & food, quick!"}
{"text":"Picked up 3 bagels for the family while out on the go. Got back to my car to find that all were burnt on the edges. I don't know if people actually like burnt bread, not I don't. What a Gaster to bring back in. Guy at register seemed irritated about it. I'm Not going to apologize for their screw up. This is the second Einstein's that's done this to me so maybe people do like burnt food!

The only reason I gave them 2 stars was because the cashier was pleasant and helpful. She may have been the manager because she was over 18 years old."}
{"text":"When I came knocking this morning around 10:15am I waited 20 minutes and received a burnt bagel. It seemed as though they were very well staffed service was very slow and unorganized! Thumbs down. Parking is always a hassle and they all need hairnets. One staff member looked as though she rolled out of bed, threw on her visor and came to work. Please get it together"}
{"text":"Not sure if this was just an off day for the store or not,  my order was to go.   I was very disappointed with the quality of my bagel,  cinnamon and sugar toasted with butter,  it had no taste and even toasted didn't look done.   The neighborhood blend coffee which is normally decent tasted bitter and burnt.   The place was very very dirty which was why order was to go.  I have too be honest I almost walked out because of it...poured out the coffee and after two bites discard the bagel.   Was bummed I spent my money."}
