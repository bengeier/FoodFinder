{"text":"This place has excellent calzones (Just had a veggie - it is awesome).  I love that they offer the option to order online.  I frequent the Bethel Park branch."}
{"text":"This place should be a sandwich shop. They have one n of the best Cod sandwiches on the South Side! But, that said, the pizza is not good. It seemed like a typical frozen dough that is tasteless and over priced. I'm interested in trying more sandwiches, but with South Side being possibly the worst place to get a pizza, this didn't help that scene. 

I actually think there IS one place to go for pizza in South Side and that is Michael's Pizza Pub on Sarah St. I just wgoch some other places would try fresh dough and quality ingredients.  It seems to work OK in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"NEVER. Never again. 

I can't even go into detail because this place was just. so. bad. I waited 25 minutes for a salad and cheese sticks, and the food here is not even something that I would buy at a ballgame. Way over priced, not at all delicious, and the service was just awful. 

I would never recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Family owned, the staff here take their jobs particularly serious and will not leave you alone until you're completely satisfied. The prices aren't bad, and if there's a wait, its worth it!"}
{"text":"Always consistent quality. Order from them often and have never had a bad experience. I think their gyros rival the best in the city and the three gyro deal for $13 is too good to pass up."}
{"text":"Had ordered from here for years until this last week when I ordered online ....Pizza said it came with white sauce which is what the wife wanted ...went and picked it up got home and Oh look red sauce. I called to see about a refund and was told WE DONT GIVE REFUNDS EITHER GET A NEW PIZZA OR TOUGH SHIT .......Uhhhhh your site says white sauce you messed up not me .....So never ever again"}
{"text":"I had a coupon to use here.  It said, \"buy one two topping pizza, get a second two topping pizza for free\".  I called and said, \"hey, can I order a four topping pizza and still get the second two topping pizza for free?\" I mean, you would think that they wouldn't penalize you for getting a more expensive pizza that you pay for, right?

Wrong.  They said it couldn't be done.  Ok fine, no biggie.  But combine that with average pizza at above average prices and then the rating starts to slide.  You don't dine in here.. I guess you could, but I've never seen anyone actually do it.  As a carry-out or delivery option, they cost as much if not more than most of the other chains (both national and local).  The sauce was average, the amount of cheese was average, pretty much everything about the pizza was average. But if I wanted an average pizza, I wouldn't want to pay more than $10 for a large (which is what Pizza Hut charges for any size any style).  I'll pay the premium for Luciano's, Mm Mm, or Mineo's, but not here."}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken pizza is really good when you're drunk. I went back the next night when I was more sober, and it was average. Interesting choice to throw potatoes as a topping for the buff chick. That was a nice touch! The pizza isn't super hot when you get it, and it doesn't seem too fresh either..."}
{"text":"The Meatball sub I had at the Pizzarella off  Homeville RD in West Mifflin was awsome in short!"}
{"text":"This place does not follow the typical clich√© of southside pizza shops. In fact they have a full menu from slices to gourmet pastas. A clean   accommodating dining area with hip ambience, plenty of seating and 2 large flat screen TVs to catch your Sunday steeler game. The food is delicious, the staff is friendly and informative of the menu items and there are always hot and fresh slices with various toppings ready to go. They also deliver. Try the Jesse James pizza."}
{"text":"Normally order from here. Ordered a steak rancher hoagie and it came with gyro meat on it. Spiced like gyro meat, etc etc. Called to complain that it isn't steak. And the \"chef\" laughed in my ear and argued with me. Isn't the customer always right?"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok.  But we ordered a steak hoagie with cheese whiz because it's rare to find that and it's my favorite way to have a steak hoagie.  When we got home found out there was no cheese whiz, it was just your typical nasty cheese sauce which completely ruined the hoagie.  We threw it all away.   Waste of $10.  Will never go again.  Don't advertise you use cheese whiz if it's not that."}
{"text":"I work close by and try to get a slice here now and then.  Their slices selection consist of one pizza Half pepperoni and half plain... it also tasted like sat there for 5 hours.  Pretty bummed, will not likely go back unless order ahead so the food is fresh"}
{"text":"I live nearby, and just wanted some takeout food. I get handed the menu and asked what their pizza roll was like. The cashier describes it as a an open-faced stromboli. Sounded fine, so I ordered it. Took about 15 minutes to come out, which is what the cashier had indicated. 

I get handed a box that was a different shape than the product was described (I expected something a little longer for a stromboli-like shape, but it was more sized for a personal pan pizza). The cashier didn't say anything. I said thanks and turned to leave. Then all of a sudden I heard and felt rolling in the box, which made me very curious. I opened it to find 8 smallish spherical pieces of dough inside. 

I turned around and mentioned that I seemed to have received the wrong box, which seemed unlikely since there were only two people in the restaurant, but I didn't want to be rude or accusatory. \"No, that's right. It's actually different than what I described. I found out when the cook started making them, apparently we just changed it up.\"

At this point, I stared at him. He didn't say anything further, so I sighed, said \"alright,\" and left. I had a World Series game to watch, I was hungry, and just tired.

However, this is awful customer experience. 

1.) The cashier didn't know the menu.
2.) The cashier finds out that the item is different than he described to a customer, but doesn't pause the order to ask if the customer still wants the item.
3.) The cashier hands me the order without saying anything, as if he's trying to get one by me. He knows what he is doing is wrong, but is just trying to avoid a conflict.
4.) After acknowledging what happened, he never apologies.
5.) He also never attempts to do right by his customer, who is clearly annoyed by the poor service. Common options include offering a free soda, offering to make a new item, issuing a $5 gift card, or as I just mentioned, offering an apology. Even an insincere one. 


That said, the food I did receive was okay. Nice flaky dough, sort of crescent roll-ish. The chicken and cheese were standard issue, nothing too interesting. Restaurant is pretty clean and plain looking."}
{"text":"I won't lie, I have never ate here before midnight or sober.

That being said I agree with some reviews about the price however for me, I am paying for convenience. The bars are closing up, you're hungry, you realize your options are limited--as they should be at 2am.

I find the pizza to be pretty good. Hey it's pizza, even when it's 'bad' it really isn't that bad at all. 

The fourth star is primarily for the seating and cleanliness. Most post-bar food options in the southside don't offer anywhere, or at best limited space, to eat. I've used the bathrooms here too and they are much better than I could imagine. 

Sure this isn't the best pizza but for the convenience you can't beat it. Much better than the other late night pizza options on Carson."}
{"text":"To me this place is meh.  

Southside is lacking in the pizza delivery department, so I was anxious to try this new option.  The man on the phone seemed confused (maybe it's because they are newer?).  The pizza arrived in a timely manner and was OK.  We ordered half pepperoni, half sausage, basic.  I would get it again since my other options are basically pizza hut and dominos, but I'm not excited about it."}
{"text":"Ordered from there website after having a good experience from their bethel park location... after over an hour and a half no food arrived and the order was apparently nowhere to be found... very upset."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch to grab something fast to eat. The place looked overall clean. I decided to get their supreme Italian hoagie on a 9in sub which is a gourmet hoagie. You get more ingredients on a gourmet hoagie than a regular hoagie for $.50 more. This was $8.99 for just the sub. It was ready in 10 minutes with no one in front of me. The hoagie was good but really greasy, probably from the sausage. I like they they cut it in half. Overall this place was okay, I'd come back, but wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this place."}
{"text":"Reminds me of the Woody Allen joke:  The food here is really awful.  Yeah, and such small portions!  Jonesing for real pizza on the South Side since the decline of Pizza Sola, we were anxious to give Pizzarella, the new place on the block, a try.  Everything about our visit was a disaster.  The counterman was so high that he was incapacitated.  After a beer at nearby Dee's, we came back for our small cheese Pizza and they hadn't yet started on it.  Did I mention that we were the only customers?  The crust on our small cheese pizza ($12) was on the thick side and the dough was raw in the center (awful food).  The pizza itself measured in at a scant 8 inches in diameter (such small portions).  We won't be going back any time soon."}
