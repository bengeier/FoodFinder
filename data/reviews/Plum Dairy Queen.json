{"text":"Who serves a Sunday without whipped cream nuts and a cherry, why this Dairy Queen does!"}
{"text":"Located on the busy Golden Mile Hwy (rt. 286) this is a very large, very clean, and well run DQ.  Friendly workers who will deliver your food to your table, stocked with ice cream cakes and other tasty frozen treats, this is a nice Dairy Queen!"}
{"text":"My family calls this \"The worlds worst DQ\". Can't do anything extra, doesn't take any coupons, kids that work there are clueless. We pass it up as well as our home to go to the one in Hyde Park. They are more than happy to make what we want."}
{"text":"I only go here because it is about 1 mile from my house and we walk when the weather is nice. It's still without sidewalks on narrow hilly roads, but that's Pittsburgh, I guess...

Quality is not as good as some other Dairy Queens. I got the 6-piece chicken strip basket and the size of the chicken tenders were more like little nuggets! Amount of fries was also quite small and the gravy was cold. It was nice that our order was served to us outside where we were sitting. 
Ugh, the ambiance is terrible. This location overlooks the main Golden Mile Highway so it's loud and smells like gasoline. There are 6 metal benches that look like they've been soaked in acid. Fine for teenagers but kind of gross for everyone else. The orange julius here was way inferior to the one I got in malls."}
