{"text":"I ate here a couple of times. I had two different salads with some changes. Very tasty, good quantity, fresh and served with friendliness. The go to place for lunch."}
{"text":"Definitely never given a \"salad\" place 5 stars.  But the ingredients were all fresh and super flavorful. Mushrooms and bacon, in particular were of the quality you'd find at expensive restaurant salad"}
{"text":"Tasteless and overpriced. Not worth it at all. Tried a few different selections and they were all bad. Don't come here!"}
{"text":"They have a wide variety of signature salads to choose from along with their power bowls (grain based) and acai smoothie bowls. If you are trying to eat clean and feel good about yourself, this is the place to go. Personally, I have never been a huge fan of salads. I thought of it as rabbit food. Forage Kitchen has changed my entire view. I can't get enough of this place.  It never gets old because you can try something new every time. The vibes there are off the charts as well. Everyone that works there is awesome and extremely helpful. Forage Kitchen makes eating a salad feel cool. Lets be real... it is all about feeling cool. If you are on State Street and have a hankering for some leafy greens, stop by Forage. Its quick and easy and you'll look hot in your bikini this summer."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean, and the salad was pretty good. I can't say the salad was worth $13. I could have made a lot more of the same thing at home for the same price. Notwithstanding the price, it's great."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Awesome grain bowls/salads, acai bowls, and smoothies! Best ever for lunch in Madison. Favorite is the powerbowl. Great fresh ingredients, great combos. Quick service too! Absolute perfection."}
{"text":"YUM!  Daughter took us here for breakfast.  Husband doesn't really care for \"salads\" but this place won him over.  Great selection of items, great if you're following a restrictive diet, helpful servers, etc.  
Go."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Tonight was my third time getting takeout from FK (2 salads and 1 acai bowl).  The concept is good as it's one of the few healthier options on State St. but it's also one of the more expensive options for takeout. Tonight I ordered the Batatas Rancheros salad ($10.50 pre-tax). Judging from the menu it seems the thing that separates the more expensive salads from the less expensive salads is the addition of avocado.  I got home to discover the teenager who made my salad forgot both the avocado and cilantro; these two things that would have made an ok salad into a good salad, not to mention that I paid for avocado I didn't get (and I'm a firm believer that avocado makes everything better).  Additionally, all of the textures in the salad were pretty similar, and by similar I mean mushy (there was also a ton of dressing).  My recommendation if you do try the Batatas Rancheros salad is to see if FK can add something crunchy to the mix (nuts? croutons?) and also to double check that you get that sweet avocado you paid for."}
{"text":"Had the power bowl. It was okay and I ate it, but it was not stellar and I think in the future I'll just make this kind of thing at home. Guacamole was good and the slaw was tasty, but I couldn't get past the nasty chewy chicken and hard undercooked rice."}
{"text":"One thing a friend/co-worker and I have talked about for the last 6 years is the lack of really good salad options at the university end of State Street. During the day I often don't have time/inclination to sit down at a restaurant and don't want to eat a really basic salads they offer (or the combination of ingredients they have is not appealing to me). The local by-the-pound salad bar at the grocery store is fine, but boring and not something I really want to spend money on. 

Forage however, is something I'm willing to spend money on! Let's be real, how often are you going to go to the trouble of preparing as many interesting toppings for your salad? Occasionally? Maybe? I love salad but hate boring ones and this is far from it. 

I've come several times since it opened and have enjoyed the staff, who are very friendly, the selection (it's incredibly hard to narrow down which toppings I want any given day) and have been so impressed with the four salads I've had. I love Chipotle as much as the next gal, but I think this is far better - wider range of choices and healthier. 

Side note: The review from A.H. below is more than a little off-base. Yes, if you build your own and get goat cheese and chicken (like I did the first time) it'll be about $12-13. But it's a massive bowl and it will fill you up just fine. The most recent salad I got (build your own, with hard boiled egg) was less. It's huge, delicious and filling.

I try to not dine out too often, but this will definitely be part of my regular rotation of the small handful of favorites in this area. It's quick, offers a great range of options, and is good for you. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here today with my wife and a colleague from out of town and we were all very satisfied with our meals. My wife and I are vegans and Forage is obviously very vegan-friendly, but I liked how knowledgeable the girls behind the counter were of animal products. You'd be surprised how many restaurants don't know what is in their dressings! Not so at Forager, since they make their own in-house. My wife and I each had a $6.50 make-your-own salad and they were extremely filling. Our colleague had one of the special salads and was stuffed for the rest of the day. We all split a goji acai bowl in two bowls for a dessert. 

I'd highly recommend walking down to Forage from the Capitol Farmer's Market for a better lunch option than what the junk-food vendors offer around the square. 

The best thing about eating plants is that there is no indigestion or heaviness afterward. By replacing meats with plants, you eliminate cancer, diabetes, heart disease, diseases of inflammation, and obesity. If you do the research, all are directly attributed to the consumption of meat, dairy, and eggs. For more information, watch Forks Over Knives, or read ANY non-industry funded large-scale/long-term clinical  study: The China Study, The Adventist Health Study, The Nurses Health Study, PREDIMED, the Epic Health Study, etc. There is no question in the scientific community that meat consumption is extremely dangerous, so much so that processed meats are even declared Class-1 carcinogens in the US. That should alarm you when ALL meat sold in the US is processed with chemicals for preservation, even the expensive \"local\" garbage.

5 stars for offering fresh healthy veggies on campus."}
{"text":"Shockingly expensive. The leaves alone are $10 and anything you actually want on your salad is an additional $3. \"Toasted flatbread\" = four pita chips crushed up on top of your salad. $2 extra. Don't go unless you're ready to spend $30 on a snack."}
{"text":"Don't be turned away by the prices, because the food here is WORTH it.  I like to make my own bowl, and their selection of different toppings can be intimidating, but they're really nice at helping explain things.  I like to make my salads with Kale+Quinoa, Sweet Potato, Corn, Broccoli (they're broccoli is nicely seasoned and has some extra flavor), edamame, lemon chicken, avocado, and green goddess dressing.  I prefer the lemon chicken to jerk chicken because the lemon chicken has slightly more flavor.  They toss the salad really nicely, and for the price you're paying, you get good quality food and a really filling meal."}
{"text":"This place is often the sole reason that I am able to meet my daily recommended amount of veggies. It's an incredibly convenient location - especially for those sad days when I have to lock myself away in Memorial and the only thing I have to look forward to is a delicious grain bowl from Forage. 

I have tried all of their grain bowls and it's so hard to pick a favorite because they're all so well balanced in flavor, chock full of healthy ingredients, and very fresh. I am very partial to their green goddess dressing but I'd have to say the Fiesta Bowl is my favorite because the tortilla chips + rice + salsa create a yummy and texturally interesting combo. So glad this place exists!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. Wow, was this good, healthy and clean. Had the Thai bowl."}
{"text":"Just mediocre...and totally overpriced for a salad. I got the forbidden forager and it was pretty bland. Would rather pay that price for a salad at the Good Food cart."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for quick healthy lunch. I really like the acai bowls her. I wish the lunch items were a bit more filling.  It's kind of expensive for the amount of food that you get. I think if it was a bit cheaper it would be more appealing for the students at UW Madison. I'm glad they have vegan options though"}
{"text":"My friend found this place on line and it sure did not disappoint. The fresh ingredients in my Thai Grain Bow that I added fresh mixed greens to was a flavor explosion in my mouth. 
I am completely satisfied with my choice and would return again and hope to find a place like this in Boston."}
{"text":"In a word? Disappointing. High prices, limited seating, long order turnaround time. I ordered an Acai bowl (I think there were only three options to choose from) and the 'toppings' were put on the top in three lines. I'm sure in a presentation sense it looks 'cute' or 'pleasant' - but for eating and having a balanced mix of the ingredients, it's off base.

Maybe I feel spoiled by Bowl Of Heaven at Hilldale Shopping Center - the have the granola at the top and bottom of the bowl and the prices match what you're offered.

They appear to specialize in salads - didn't try one, might go back and see if one will change my mind on this restaurant."}
{"text":"\"As good as it gets\" for a salad bar.

Forage is the rare place I revisit over and over again. It's the place I take my guy friends who complain about me taking them to a 'lame diet salad bar' but then they become impressed and can hardly finish their food because they're so full. Most of them have started to frequent Forage more often than chipotle or Naf Naf.  

I love chipotle but I go there maybe twice a year because it's a waste of money for a non memorable experience for something I can almost make at home. 

Forage is a little more expensive (around $10) if you get a pre-made menu bowl which I'd recommend; they're usually better deals and they all taste great. Other than taste, they have fresh quality (not fake rubbery meat), unique flavors (like pickled watermelon rind and amazing dressings), and delicious tempeh for vegans. The tempeh is way too salty but I'll get over it. You can taste that they're really not cutting as many corners as other restaurants. 

They also carry cold pressed juice, teas, and kombucha. 

*Cons: 
-They charge extra if you want half salad half rice. Why? 
-The kombucha isn't very carbonated and very sweet."}
{"text":"We love Forage! Their black rice is to die for! Their cilantro is the best I've ever had. Lots of options and they all taste great.  Wonderful customer service, too."}
{"text":"I got the club med salad to go and it was so good!! I was surprised they put raisins in a Mediterranean salad, but they added a sweet flavor that was surprisingly tasty. The lemon chicken was also good quality and delicious. My friend got a salad with the jerk chicken but she didn't like it as much. They were a good sized salads as well."}
{"text":"Was not very busy around lunchtime and smelled AMAZING in there. Ordered the Power Bowl which came with about a cup of rice, cup of jerk flavored chicken and a cup of other toppings so it was a lot of food for the price paid. The food was very flavorful and staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"The food is good, farm to table type of salads.  They're a bit pricy-not prohibitive, and you get your money's worth.  The seating is limited, with lines of people.  The music is loud, too loud to have a relaxing conversation in the middle of the day.  If you go, and the weather is warm, order takeout and go some place less frantic to enjoy."}
{"text":"Not the cheapest place to get a salad around Madison but totally worth it. The staff are nice and helpful and the food is fresh and delicious. This place is also great if you have any dietary restrictions because everything can be customized. Next time I'm in town I'll definitely be back to try an açaí bowl."}
{"text":"My experience at Forage Kitchen started out a bit confusing, but I ended up with a delicious and healthy meal.

Confusing:
For a place that seems like they're really interested in health, they don't have a lot of information readily available regarding their food. For example, I asked for an ingredients list for their meats, and dressings and they were not able to provide that information. (I.e. No binder of ingredients)

I ended up speaking to a lovely employee who did her best to answer my questions. Although she could not tell me with 100% certainty what was in each item, she was able to talk with me about my concerns.

I ended up with a batatas rancheros with jerk chicken (no black beans, or corn). IT WAS AMAZING. I will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Forage is one of the best lunches in Madison. I especially love the Power Bowl and Curry Bowl. It's wonderful to have a quick and healthy option so close to campus! Seating is limited and the restaurant can be loud, but it's a great lunch to pick up."}
{"text":"Pretty expensive for a stand at the counter/build your own/bus your plates kind of place. My salad was large and delicious, so they certainly back up their prices with taste, but my plate was dirty (had some residual red sauce on the outer edges), and the staff wasn't overly friendly. 

There's not much seating, so this isn't a place to bring papers to grade or things to read/assignments to do, but if you want a big hearty salad and would rather pay around $12 for it than go through the work of making it at home, this place is what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Wow!  My thai chicken bowl was Amazing.  I will definitely go back for other bowls.  Nice, clean place and friendly staff.   The pic on this is not as nice as it could be.  The bowl I had was beautiful and tasty."}
{"text":"If the prices were just a tad lower this would be the perfect lunch spot. As it is it is the best place for a healthy yet tasty lunch close to campus.

The options are good, but sometimes include unnecessary ingredients. The chicken In the local roots for example is completely unnecessary. And so are the raisins in the big fattoush. So I think I'll stick to the build your own option. Ingredients are fresh and tasty (well most of them are tasty - a few like edamame are quite tasteless). Dressings are really good.

Service is mostly ok, but sometimes gets stuck for random reasons way too long.

Will be back regularly."}
{"text":"4 stars because I am thrilled to have a restaurant to eat at while on the Whole30 diet and the food and ingredients are top-notch! 

-1 star, because the dishes are pretty pricey. $11 for a salad that, while excellent, I could easily make at home seems a little high, especially on campus.

However, I would absolutely go here again and it is so amazing to have healthy and tasty food options accessible on State Street, where the norm tends to be fried and greasy. 

This is an excellent restaurant for people on Whole30 or Paleo diets, and vegans and gluten-free people will also love it."}
{"text":"They're the best quick serve salad place in town with great menu options or you can build your own.

I prefer \"the batatas\"  or \"local roots\" but I am sure there are some great grain bowl options as well. 

My only criticism is that the salads are not well replicated each visit because each person does a different heaping amount of the ingredients, if they leveled off ingredient scoops the sales would be more consistent visit to visit."}
{"text":"Cheers to a business that listens to customer feedback and adapts: after a lackluster start, with somewhat expensive (i.e. $13) build-your-own salads, Forage Kitchen regrouped and now sells smartly and deliciously designed salads and bowls for $9-$11. I'm a particular far of the Thai bowl, which is just as good (possibly better) served over kale instead of black rice. I'm thrilled to have a good salad place close to work."}
{"text":"Like a Chipotle for delicious salads and acai bowls. All of the ingredients were super fresh and delicious. Best of all, you leave feeling really good and not weighed down. The acai bowl I got with homemade cashew butter was awesome."}
{"text":"cool place, friendly workers, the salads are delicious and you feel good eating them as everything is as local as it gets.  However it is a bit pricy for a salad ($9-10 each)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Friday. First impression, sticker shock. I ordered a lime chicken Cesar salad, it was more than $11 just for the salad. The vegetables were ok, but I found the lime over powering. The chicken was dry. There are much better options in the area for a quality salad for under $10 with, bread and beverage."}
{"text":"This place is perfection. The staff is incredibly nice, and the salads are amazing. My husband got a power bowl and he really loved it too. I have a lot of dietary restrictions, and a lot of places won't let you swap out toppings for something different, or act really grumpy about that sort of thing, but they are more than happy to let you switch toppings on their menu salads. I also really appreciate that all of their dressings are gluten and dairy free, and they have that posted on a sign, which saved me from asking about every ingredient in every dressing until I find the one that works. We only got food bowls, which were very reasonably priced compared to other similar places I've been!"}
{"text":"I love the fact that they think outside the box when it comes to their ingredients. Instead of the same ol' dressings that most resto's have, they've included zhoug (Mediterranean herb-y sauce), maple sherry dressing, salsa roja, and more. Even their proteins are refreshingly diverse (i.e. lemon & jerk chicken, and flavored tempeh). Kudos to them for expanding people's pallets- the world isn't homogeneous and neither should a salad be."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan! Yes, it's pricey but you get a really fresh, really filling meal that you feel good about afterwards... you can't get much better than that. Make your own salad or grain bowl and try the acai bowl if you want something sweet but wholesome to tide you over! I don't really recommended getting it to go if you aren't gonna eat it within the next 10 minutes though, since it gets kinda melty. I tried the cyc bowl and I really liked the cashew butter and coconut. I'm not sure if the actual berry taste of the acai smoothie part is my kinda thing, but I think most people love it. Yay, Forage ilysm and I can't wait to come back to you and your fresh array of healthy fooooodz."}
{"text":"Outstanding fast food. The salads and acai bowls are great. For the quality of the ingredients, the prices are certainly reasonable. Comfortable seating."}
{"text":"I am a big big fan of Forage Kitchen. It's refreshing to have a quick non-sandwich shop AND healthier option near campus. In my few visits, I have really stuck to the signature creations instead of venturing off in the \"make your own\" territory.

The Power Bowl won me over instantly. Flavors on flavors. Jerk chicken, lentils, poblano slaw, guac and more combine to offer a sweet, medium level spicy, and filling option for a quick lunch at only $9. 

In my opinion, the food tastes more high quality and upscale then anything else in it's Madison cafe demographic. It's quick food, but it's far from the typical stereotypes of fast food: unhealthy, low quality, etc. 

I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Yes! This place is everything. Finally a quick healthy food solution on State Street. This is a perfect place to treat yourself after yoga or in between class. It's guilt free food without the blah taste. Love. Love. Love."}
{"text":"I visited FK begrudgingly.  The reason:  It is in the former site (for at least 75 years) of College Barbers-a place I started going to when I was in college and since I moved back 11 years ago, a place I visited monthly.  I am a creature of habit and the thought of eating an acai bowl on this hallowed ground was hard to get my mind wrapped around.
But....I did stop in and was pleasantly surprised.  Think of it as Chipotle meets clean food.  Not only can you build your own salad/rice bowl but they have some regular items on their menu.  
I opted for the Power Bowl.  On the menu it's listed as forbidden black rice, rosemary lentils, roasted sweet potatoes, poblano slaw, green onion, house guacamole, jerk chicken, goddess dressing.  The reason why my review is not 5 stars is that brown rice was used instead of black.  This may be nit picky but forbidden rice has become a hot trend and if you aren't going to use it don't list it.
Rice aside, I must admit the bowl was absolutely delicious. Everything was well prepared, fresh tasting, and paired well with the other ingredients.
Service was fast and friendly.  There are a few tables to dine at but I saw most people take it to go.
Kudos FK, you just got a fan."}
{"text":"Excellent and tasty! Came here on a whim because we were feeling like we should have something heavy after a workout. Ordered two grain bowls, the Thai Bowl and the Power Bowl (felt like the salads wouldn't be as filling). They were absolutely delicious! I liked the jerk chicken better than the lemon chicken, but I thought it was a wonderful blend of flavors. I am not sure how actually healthy this place is, but it sure does seem to fit right in with the hip healthy food fad craze (avocado and all). For a couple more bucks then Chipotle for all of these healthy and fresh ingredients, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were very happy with the salads we had at forage kitchen. I made my own while my partner selected a pre-determined one on their menu. I selected quinoa and spinach for my base with carrots, beets, sprouts and broccoli. I also chose to add avocado for a little bit more. They had 7 dressings premade but i chose olive oil and balsamic vinegar for mine. It was delicious with plenty of leftovers.
The salad my partner selected included wild rice, he was surprised by the texture of it."}
{"text":"Hard to find a good lunch on State that doesn't fill you up on empty calories. Quick salads and acai bowls that are very satisfying. Prices are very reasonable and look forward to eating on their patio all summer."}
{"text":"While my manager was in town she was looking for a place for a healthy lunch so I suggested Forage. Salads, grain bowls, acai bowls, and juices seemed like a good variety without the temptations of Wisconsin's usual deep-fried delicacies. 

By the time lunch rolled around I was quite hungry because I hadn't gotten around to breakfast and I didn't think a salad was going to cut it. I opted for a grain bowl, the Power Bowl, substituting their lemon chicken for the jerk. 

Comprising forbidden rice, rosemary lentils, roasted sweet potatoes, poblano slaw, green onion, house guacamole, chicken, and green goddess dressing, it was a very hearty serving and quite delicious. The textures work well together with the crunchy cabbage, toothy rice, and creamy roasted potatoes. The guacamole is really what ties the dish together, though - I'd run out before my last few bites and I missed it greatly. Still tasty without but stellar with. 

I also tried the ginger lemonade. Delicious but weak on the ginger - if I hadn't known from the label I likely wouldn't have picked up on it from taste. 

Long story short it's been over twenty-four hours and I'm still thinking about that bowl and how much I wish it was my dinner instead of the leftovers sitting in my fridge."}
{"text":"This place is a nice change from other food options around the Madison area. I like that they keep it fresh and season. I've had both the bowls and smoothies. I love the bowls but sometimes feel like there is not enough sauce. The smoothie was just \"ok\" but it's refreshing to see Madison offering a place with quick/healthy options. Great location and great selection of drinks. Can't beat getting a bowl and kombucha"}
{"text":"A really perfect healthy, nutritious but flavorful lunch. The Thai bowl is out of this world. The local root salad is also amazing."}
{"text":"I love this place! For years, I struggled to find enough convenient and tasty health food options near the Madison campus, but once Forage opened, I was in heaven! Though the prices seem a bit steep, they use extremely tasty and fresh ingredients, and the portions are generous! I love that Forage serves up dishes that are as quick as fast food, but as healthy/high quality as a nice restaurant.

When I was a UW Madison student, I would always get the power bowl. Every veggie in it is delicious, and the homemade guac on top is amazing. Plus, the chicken is super flavorful and cooked to perfection.

They also serve awesome kombucha that is made in-house, and the staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"The concept is great, and the online ordering system is easy and convenient. I used it to order a make-your-own salad bowl, which I was a little disappointed with. The portions are generous, but the ingredients were on the flavorless side. I got spinach with brown rice as my base, and added edamame (flavorless), roasted broccoli (this was the best out of all the ingredients), green onion, fingerling potatoes (flavorless), roasted sweet potato, and roasted beets with the Za'atar Spiked Lemon. There wasn't much dressing, and what was there didn't add that much to the salad. There were also protein options you could add, but they're $3 each. I guess since it was a make-your-own, I don't have anyone to blame but myself for a crap salad. I would definitely go back again though. Maybe this time I'll opt for one of their signature salads..."}
{"text":"Wow. Just as good a second trip round. This time had the lemonade which was fine and an acai bowl. Quality ingredients, friendly staff. I will continue to come back while I am in town. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Forage. Everything is fresh and healthy (and mostly local). My go-to are the Goji Berry Acai bowl and the Power Bowl. The reason I'm giving it 4/5 stars is because their quality is starting to go downhill just a bit. I'm in love with the Power Bowl -- it has a diverse taste of crunchy, sweet, and savory, and their proportions have always been generous. Lately, the proportions have gotten smaller, which is fine, but it's just not tasting as good as it did the first time. The last two times I ordered the Power Bowl, there were less than five pieces of sweet potatoes and a TON of rice. I think the math is off a bit on the ingredients. Otherwise, I might have to try something else, which I'm more than happy to but hope they fix the Power Bowl soon!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate here this past week. Salads were big, flavorful and healthy. Both of my girls ordered the acai bowls which they enjoyed. I ordered the Lime Caesar with chicken. Definitely would come back again wish they had one if these near my home town."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere! My husband, our kids, and I are relatively new to the healthy eating world and were a bit reluctant to try a new place. I got the power bowl, my husband got the Thai bowl, and our children got açaí bowls. Each of us about licked our bowls clean! We are currently trying to recreate the bowls at home and we will certainly be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"FORAGE IS OVERWHELMING AT FIRST, BUT YOU NEED TO GO MULTIPLE TIMES TO FIGURE OUT THE PERFECT SALAD FOR YOU!!! 
The first time I went here I felt rushed, uncomfortable, and unpleased. I had no clue what lettuce, toppings, or dressing I wanted, and they weren't listed anywhere. 
The second time I went I took my time. I asked for help from the employee and she let me sample dressings. I found something that worked for me!
The salads are overpriced and the best stuff is charged for extra, which is kind of a bummer, but I love how clean the food is and the variety they offer. On top of that, the people that work there are super helpful!"}
{"text":"I came here because I saw this place while I was walking on State. I was with a girlfriend and we wanted a healthy meal. We came in and were pleasantly surprised! Tried the Thai Grain Bowl and it was amazing. They also had siracha sauce on the side which is always a plus. This bowl was amazing and a lot of food for only $9. I loved the way the Thai chicken tasted.

There are a lot of other options here like salads that I would really like to try. As well as this there are Acai bowls which look really yummy! I probably could come here for breakfast lunch and dinner and be happy. There are also energy bites which were really tasty.

My girlfriend bought the Power bowl and it was delicious. Came with yummy guac-esq stuff on top that tasted 10/10. Yum! I also like that there isn't an option to buy pop. Because all the drinks are healthy too.

Service was fast and employees were really nice and helpful!

I really really enjoyed my food here. I am from Canada so I'm so surprised to see people leaving YELP reviews complaining about the price. Where I'm from this kind of food would be at least $15 a bowl. So quit ya complaining!"}
{"text":"this is like your typical hipster overpriced venue for people that want good instagram photos. The salad had \"Kale\" except it definitely wasn't kale that I was served and it just felt like super upper-class and snobby."}
{"text":"This place was a godsend during finals week because I frequently needed something convenient and fast that wouldn't make me crash. Chipotle wasn't the answer.

The Thai Bowl and Big Fattoush are my favorites, but you really can't go wrong no matter what you order."}
{"text":"I went back in to try one of their bowls for lunch. I opted for the Thai bowl. It bowl was full of variety  of veggies: roasted sweet potatoes, daikon, cucumber over their forbidden black rice glazed with flavorful Thai red curry sauce. The cilantro, Thai basil and lemon herb chicken are some great aromatics and protein to go on top. Mix it up and you are ready to go. Each bite then has a spectrum of flavors to keep your taste buds engaged. The line was quite long, but seemed to move pretty quickly. The price is around $10-15 for a lunch; depending on what you add in your salad or bowl. A friend of mine said hers is usually about $17. That seemed a little steep for me for a quick lunch though. I got mine in a to-go container. I'm glad I did. We were eating and chatting, so I didn't realize how fast the grains filled me up. I think I was able to eat half of the bowl and then took the rest home. It was great re-heated and retained its flavor. They do have some seating inside and out. Most of the business seems to be to-go business though."}
{"text":"A wonderfully healthy meal! I was helped making low-carb choices by the young lady making salads, and settled on the Local Roots salad. She presented my fresh and delicious salad with a flourish, a nice touch of personality often lacking with the younger generation. Nice work, young lady! And Forage Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Fresh & tasty. 

I am a big fan of the Batata ranchers, yum. That salsa roja dressing is delicious. The roasted jerk chicken is high quality, and all of the additional toppings make it supreme. 

Caesar is my other go to,the egg is a nice touch.

Best part, you feel better after eating their food. :)"}
{"text":"This is a favorite stop of mine anytime I'm in Madison!

I'm usually flying in and out of Forage to get lunch before heading to a meeting, so I appreciate how fast this place is. More importantly though, it's so healthy and the food is so flavorful that you don't wish you were eating something else!

I am a huge fan of the grain bowls here, and my top favorite is the Thai Bowl, featuring Thai red curry sauce, forbidden black rice, roasted sweet potatoes, daikon, cucumber, cilantro, Thai basil, and lemon herb chicken. It's one of the best lunches I've ever had, actually, and I keep ordering it every time. The Fiesta Bowl is great as well, but still doesn't beat the Thai Bowl.

Forage is a beautiful, clean space and is a perfect spot to unwind for a little bit during a busy work day. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Forage Kitchen is really good. I've had the Club Med bowl and it was awesome. It was like a salad from a Mediterranean restaurant, just a little fresher and better. And quite a bit better than a salad I remember getting anywhere else. 

The reason I don't eat there often is that it's outside of my price range. It was somewhere between $10-$15 for the signature salad. It's not that it's not worth it, because it is. But it's more expensive than what I'd pay for a dish I eat regularly.

The location is good- it's right by Memorial Library and the University Bookstore. It has a nice and low-key atmosphere inside the place. They may have outdoor seating, although I haven't actually used it.

I had not heard of this place until someone mentioned it was a new place from the owner of Roast. For how good the food was, I'd say Forage is not promoted as much as you'd expect."}
{"text":"Amazing. Had the Med Salad, green juice and açaí bowl. To die for. But best part is their delivery guy brought me a Rose with my food for Valentine's Day. So sweet!"}
{"text":"Truly spectacular food with equally bad service. 

They have quite possibly the best salad concoctions on the planet. Sadly, their service will make it a one time affair no matter how patient a patron you are. I've even tried using their delivery service to get around it as their Forbidden Salad is just that good. Even then they fail to acknowledge their orders even though delivery services require human confirmation (not just electronic). When called on this, no apologies are offered and they seemed relieved if you cancel as if that makes their job easier to meet demand.

I really hate leaving so poor a review for a menu that has such excellent care invested. The service honestly makes this low rating inescapable."}
{"text":"When you think of healthy food, you may think of plain and boring greens. But Forage Kitchen is far from that - there are bold, delicious flavors in their food and their ingredients are fresh (and good for you!) I chose the Power Bowl and was able to substitute the chicken for tempeh (which I was super excited about). The serving was pretty big and I was able to eat the bowl for two meals. My favorite parts of the bowl was definitely the tempeh and the guacamole. The guac was super fresh and really added a lighter feel to the heavier proteins in the dish. I might build my own dish next time so I can customize it a bit more, but overall it was a great meal!"}
{"text":"Favorite local place to get salads. The portions are great, ingredients fresh, and I haven't been disappointed thus far!

My all time favorite salad is the Cultured Cobb -- it is the most expensive at $12.50, but it's loaded up with a lot of Cobb salad-y goodness. It's paired with a creamy red wine vinaigrette that works really well with the rest of the flavors in the salad. The Batatas Racheros is very good too (sweet potatoes yum). Some friends had the power bowl and were pleased as well. I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any menu item here!

I can vouch for one of the acai bowls -- the Gogi Berry High is so tasty! Would definitely get this again. 

Forage is great -- can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"When I first walked past this place and saw the name,  I was completely intrigued. Then I read the menu on the window and saw greens and grains and that everything was organic! It's exciting to me that there's a restaurant that I can go to when I'm downtown, that serves healthy and delicious options similar to what I can prepare for myself at home. I wish more establishments would have a few of these options. Sometimes I want to avoid wheat, or would like a healthy vegetarian or vegan meal.  So, this first visit I decided to order the Thai grain bowl. It was fantastic. Yummy, yum. Lovely forbidden black rice, sweet potato, and a few other crunchy shredded veggies mingle together really nicely in a curry sauce. Next time I might ask for the sauce on the side because it was quute soupy for me. This Thai bowl also came with chicken. It's fun to watch them put your meal together (they create it in front of you). You can easily  personalize your meal if you need something left out, etc. 
Nice and friendly staff. Interior is not large but there are a few tables. This location is at the bottom of State Street though, so it's super convenient to the memorial union and other hot spots. 
I can't wait to go back and try something else from the menu."}
{"text":"I love Forage! It definitely fills a gap that Madison is missing in quick, healthy, affordable meals.

Most of the menu is a \"make your own salad\" style (although they also have grain bowls). They also have pre-made options with suggested toppings like the one I got, batatas rancheros, which had sweet potatoes, avocado, black beans, corn, and green onion. The original suggestion comes with chicken, but I easily substituted that with their homemade tempeh, which you can do for any of the salads.

The place was modern and clean when I was there. It was decently busy, but they seem to have a lunch rush and staff accordingly, as the line moved along nicely.

All of their dressings are vegan and gluten-free. Additionally, they make them homemade, so if you have any questions about ingredients, they should be able to answer them.

On the way out, my friend and I got an acai bowl and it took about 10 minutes for it to come out. The girl making it seemed to have trouble with the blender and subsequently gave the bowl to the wrong person, so a little bit of a mix up there. I also noticed there was fresh bread at the end of the salad line, but they never offered any when I was in line. There weren't any signs anywhere indicating how much the bread was either.

All in all, the food was good, the staff were friendly, and I feel like I got a good value for the price I paid. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The salad was delicious and high quality. The tempeh was some of the best I've ever had. I also had a cold pressed juice, which was wonderful but a huge splurge ($9)."}
{"text":"I came here once for a lunch meeting and got the Batatas Rancheros signature salad which comes with shredded romaine, sweet potatoes, fresh corn, black beans, roasted jerk chicken, green onion, cilantro, avocado, and salsa roja dressing. The first bite seemed really spicy. I don't have much of a tolerance for heat and I got nervous that I wasn't going to be able to eat much of it without chugging water throughout the whole meeting. But then the second bite was better and very enjoyable and the salad only tasted moderately spicy after that. I think the initial bit of spice just caught me off guard.

Overall, the salad had a great mix of ingredients and flavors. I usually find it hard to justify paying more than $10 for just a salad, but you really a lot for your money and it will definitely fill you up and keep you full! I will definitely be back for another Batatas Rancheros or another salad or grain-bowl!"}
{"text":"Forage is everything. They sell all that is good in the world and create flavor combinations that I can only aspire to repeat at home. 

They keep it local with the great NessAlla KOMBUCHA and make their own cold pressed JUICES as well, which I have yet to try. Alongside these drinks, Forage offers pre-packed but homemade raw ENERGY BITES that I'm similarly intrigued by. I've attempted to make these on my own a few times, but something about dates and the flavors I pair that base with doesn't add up for me. I'm curious to try them at Forage and deduce how theirs are made.

The bulk of the menu then consists mostly of various grain bowls and custom salads. In my last visit I was drawn to so many ingredients on the menu that I struggled to choose, but the POWER BOWL is the way to go. 

I actually first found the Power Bowl via a photo and luscious description on Forage's Facebook page. It's served as a bowl of forbidden black rice, rosemary lentils, roasted sweet potatoes, poblano slaw, green onion, house guacamole, jerk chicken and goddess dressing. 

The crunchy textures of the rice and lentil pair with the soft sweetness of the potato and crisp freshness of the slaw and onion. The guacamole and chicken add plenty of substance to the bowl to make this a dish that can honestly be enjoyed in two sittings, making the $8+ price tag well worth it. 

On top of all this ingredient greatness, it's the goddess dressing that's Forage's secret weapon. The flavors of the dressing escalate the bowl to the point that I struggle to imitate it, which is good news for Forage. I'm so hooked that I will be back often for this bowl alone.

Another star at Forage is the ACAI BOWLS. It makes me so very happy that I can enjoy an acai bowl in Madison, Wis. and so close to my apartment. The acai bowls at Forage have my respect. They're healthily creamy, filling yet light and have well-chosen toppings. 

Of the three acai bowls, I ordered the CYC. It arrived to me as a beautifully deep-purple bowl topped with coconut, bee pollen and cacao nibs. 

I so enjoyed the bowl that I made a trip to Whole Foods straight after to pick up some frozen acai packs to attempt to make my own bowl at home. Let's just say that the version I concocted made me even more so appreciate the pro-preparation of the acai bowls at Forage. The creaminess is hard to achieve!

The fact that I struggle to remake the dishes I've so enjoyed at Forage (i.e. the Power Bowl and CYC acai bowl) is the main reason why Forage ranks so high in my book. I respect any place that can take seemingly simple ingredients and transform them into something that I cannot--this is what makes steeper prices well worth it. I will gladly pay for food of this quality and for the creativity and skill demonstrated at Forage."}
{"text":"The college student. Hungry. Fatigued. Disoriented. She seeks out sustenance before continuing her long and arduous journey of studying for her upcoming finals. Not far from her nest, aka Memorial Library, she begins... her Forage.

JK. So maybe this isn't a nature documentary about the poor, starving student (aka me) on her quest to find food, and maybe more about the ironically-named restaurant where students go to pay overpriced rice/salad bowls (aka me, again). Nevertheless, there won't be any foraging at this conveniently located eatery. If you want a quick, healthy bite that tastes good and is close to campus, I'd recommend adding this place to your repertoire.

My favorite is the Thai bowl, which includes black rice, sweet potatoes, and pickled carrots/daikons over yellow curry. Second favorite is the power bowl, which includes jerk chicken, sweet potatoes, guacamole, and lentils. Expect to pay about $10.50 for either bowls."}
{"text":"A delicious and guilt free meal. I highly recommend the Thai bowl! New favorite place"}
{"text":"So many delicious, healthy, customizable options. The power bowl and cold pressed juices are delicious!"}
{"text":"Best salads. Always fresh, friendly and delicious. Excellent topping choices and the dressings are amazing. Super filing too!"}
