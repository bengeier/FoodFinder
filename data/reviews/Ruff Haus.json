{"text":"Great menu with plenty of gluten free options .   Dogs are welcome and are brought water but they are not supposed to be loose on the restaurant side . Highly recommend if you have a dog or if you would like to have a dog"}
{"text":"I love Verdun's brand new doggy cafe! We organized a Frenchie meetup here yesterday night and everything went super smoothly.

First off, the owner and employees are the sweetest. They warmly welcomed our little pack of rambunctious Frenchies and made sure we were comfortable and didn't lack anything. You won't find moody rushed waitresses here. 

The dining room is long and narrow, cool yet cozy. Our puppy crew took over one of their comfy dark leather booths. The gym wasn't ready yet but the staff was nice enough to let our dogs play in the room. Apparently they will transform it into a real gym in the near-future, with a treadmill, hoops and other toys to tire your dog out (which means better sleep for us!). To avoid chaos and respect timid dogs and owners in the dining room, dogs can only roam around freely in the gym. 

I tried the Salty Dog and Bloody Hound cocktails. Love the names, and the taste even more! The drinks were not overly sweet. The muttball open sandwich was tasty and filling. Maybe I would have preferred a regular sub though, as I didn't feel like eating it with a knife and fork. The dogs went nuts over homemade yogurt pups and treats picked off the doggy menu. They even serve dinner if your furry bff doesn't feel like cooking. 

We can't wait to come back for brunch, for a drink or just to hang out!"}
{"text":"This place is great. You can come on a Saturdays morning to enjoy brunch or a Thursday night for a nice drink. 

What's great is that your dog is welcome and receives a V.I.P treatment: personal water bowl, towel to wash his paws at the entrance, supervised playing area and more...

Great decor, smooth music and great staff."}
{"text":"Been to the Doggy Cafe on Papineau and thought it was the same concept but it is not. The Doggy Cafe has been conceived for dogs to play freely and tables for you to sit at and order a drink or eat a bit. 

Here, it is a real restaurant where you are allowed to bring your dog in while having a meal. You need to keep your dog on a leash and there are hooks on the floor to keep your dog close to your table.

I was very surprised at the quality of he good there. It was delicious! Tried the chicken waffle with mac & cheese dish and it was so yummy. The fried chicken was a bit spicy and I tasted a hint of garlic which was perfect for me. I'm not a fan of Mac and cheese so could have easily left it out without complaining.

The decor is also very nice, I think they kept it the same as the old steakhouse.

They have an alcohol license so you can actually go there are grab a drink...they close at 9pm Thursday and Friday so I'm definitely going back to try their cocktails without the guilt of leaving my dog home :)"}
{"text":"A quick walk from station de l'Ã‰glise is the newest and coolest doggy cafe: Ruff Haus. We rolled up here with our posse of snorty, somewhat hyper Frenchies and took over the corner by the front window. We were greeted by the sweetest waitress ever, who came over with treats and fresh water for the pups. We humans settled in with the menus and ordered up some drinks.

It's a restaurant, so you do need to order food if you're going to drink booze, but the prices are all reasonable and everything came out quickly and was tasty.  I had the faux chicken wrap and it was really good. Lots of beers on tap and a full bar, so there's definitely something for every taste.

All of the staff is friendly and obviously, loves dogs. The owner was so happy that our crew came by and kept asking when we're coming back. She opened up the gym on the side even though it hasn't been completed yet so that the beasts could run around off leash and play. Unlike some of the other dog cafes, this one has little hooks all over the floor so that the pups are tied up and right by your table, they aren't supposed to wander (mine escaped at one point though and everyone was very cool about it!)

The place is super cozy, plays great music and people are constantly stopping by the window to laugh and smile at the pups...some even came in just to dole out pets and love. I left Ruff Haus with the happiest, warm feeling and can't wait to go back."}
