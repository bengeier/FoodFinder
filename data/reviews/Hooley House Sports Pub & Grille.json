{"text":"Near hotel. Was open. There was a band.

Places that are open--late--near hotels shouldn't be rated with fewer than two stars."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service! The atmosphere is fun and everyone is always having a good time! Love the weekend band and $3 drinks! It's nice to have some local and craft beers on tap, too!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.- bland food, obnoxious waitress that would come by every 4 seconds, no \"healthy options\" foods. Unless you love chicken and taco meat, not much else to choose from"}
{"text":"It was 10:30 in Aug  on a Friday night and our party of 4 needed some food and to relax. We are not familiar with the area and stopped in. For a late night our waitress Jess was all smiles. Although she had tables outside she was very attentive. So attentive that she noticed there was a new bartender and wanted to make sure we were happy with the drink re-orders. Nice. Thanks for paying attention Jess. We were happy By the way.
They Serve a FULL MENU until midnight, I was told, and they have a limited menu until 2:00am. (That's the way it should be done, good job!) The food was very good, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was great. (I was amazed that the crowd was a mix of young and old. )
Many TV's displayed sports channels and appropriate music was playing. imho.
If I have one thing to say that needs improved upon.... The parking lot needs lighting at night. There is a large parking lot but I remember it being very dark. Other than that it deserved 5 stars for our visit. Thanks Jess!"}
{"text":"The Hooley House has Irish American food. I have never had a bad meal here. The staff is super friendly, and it is a great place to watch the game. HH is kid friendly, and has plenty of space to move around (the tables are not right on top of each other). I always have a good time when I come here."}
{"text":"Went to Hooley House for a Cavs game in December with some family that were in town for the holidays. Had an amazing experience! The staff was phenomenal. Our group ended up tripling in size and they easily accommodated us. The food was very good. Overall, a really great time!"}
{"text":"I have been going here ever since it opened and that have improved since then. The owner is really the nicest owner around all the food is great the service is better then anywhere else. They treat me as if I am family to them.

So come in you will enjoy yourself and enjoy the food"}
{"text":"Things have changed dramatically, food and personalities. Last two times I've ordered the food was horrendous! The usual staff take care of us but something needs to change!!! Enough with the turnover with the staff..."}
{"text":"Decent beer selection and a fun atmosphere.  The patio is nice as well.  Don't order the Shepherds Pie!  Looks like a bowl of slop and the taste isn't far from it either."}
{"text":"I'm not real big on complimenting places for atmosphere but the place had tons of tvs for football viewing. That's where I draw a blank for further compliments. The food was absolutely flavorless and bad. Service was slow and got order wrong. I had Cajun wings that tasted like fried wings soaked in water. I had a side of firecracker sauce to dip wings in. Amazingly that was also totally flavorless. The food was straight up gross. If you like overpriced under flavored barely edible fried crap on a plate this place is for you."}
{"text":"Was taken here for my birthday the other day by friends. Had never been before, and I must say that my experience was much better than I thought it would be. Drinks were great. The food though, out of this world! Over all everything was excellent! I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We were passing through town and stopped for lunch. We sat on the patio which was really nice, food was good but one sandwich we ordered was not as described on the menu, but still good. The staff was great! From the girls at the door, to our server, to the 2 managers that stopped to chat! We liked the atmosphere inside and will definitely stop again!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible! Taylor, our server, made the meal worthwhile. She was awesome! Ask for her if you want good service, otherwise, you'll be ignored."}
{"text":"The food was great. The corned beef was stacked with a lot of meat, and tasted great. My cousin got the cob salad and had to take half of it home because she couldn't finish it all. She said it was delicious.

The waitres was friendly and checked back with us just the right amount of times. We didnt have to wait long for the food.  The sampler appetizer was good too and the food came shortly after we finished our appetizer."}
{"text":"I just read all of the reviews and I completely disagree with the overpriced statement. It's overpriced if you are used to the dollar menu at McDonalds. The Hooley House has the biggest portions I have ever seen for the price. They have a lot of TV's. It is more of a sit down bar atmosphere. Kind of like a mix between a bar and a resturant. The patio outside is nice, weather permitting. 

It might get a little roudy for small children or an older couple, but everyone else I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hooley House is a little bit overrated. It's very noisy and it has your typical bar food. The waitresses are good and they usually have decent drink specials. It's pretty much your average sports bar.  There are definitely better places to go to watch the game. This place is good, just not great"}
{"text":"Just tried this place tonight -- thoroughly enjoyed it!  I got the Irish mac & cheese which was good, but it was honestly a bit bland for my liking.  What blew me away was the buffalo chicken dip!  Oh man, I could eat that stuff for the next week and not grow tired of it.  Yummy!  I was instantly taken back to numerous super bowl parties from my past.  Happy times...

Anyway, to get back to the review, I really liked the people there and the general feel of the place.  It is an ADHD person's dream -- tons of TV's everywhere!  I really enjoyed the food; especially for a bar, the food was really good.  The service was great -- at the end when we were yapping away the waitress came and filled our water glasses multiple times.  There was an open mic, and everybody who sang was impressively good.  It did get a bit loud, but I didn't mind.  I would definitely come back.  

Get the buffalo chicken dip!  After reading other's reviews I will have to try the hooley hunks next time."}
{"text":"Been here several times but tonight the service sucked big time. Server did not keep up with any of the three tables she had. They are not even half full so not busy at all."}
{"text":"Just left Hooley's and wasn't too impressed. The waitress was too busy taking shots with other customers to do her job. When I did finally get a refill, it was a Pepsi instead of the Dr. Pepper I had requested. The ketchup bottle she brought me was practically empty. The food was good,
not great but just good. I ordered the cheesesteak with au jus, but the waitress served it without the au jus. Basically, it's not worth a visit unless everything else is closed like it was for me (Sunday at 10 pm)."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants! I go here at least once a week for pub trivia. The staff is incredibly friendly & I haven't had something here I don't like! On Wednesdays they have pub trivia & also $4 martinis which are delicious, I've tried most of them. I'd recommend the Hooley hunks (boneless wings), boxty (potato pancakes) or their signature apple pie shots."}
{"text":"Wow, terrible service from staff across all boards.  Liked watching games there previously , but maybe not so much.  Might have to pick a new place."}
{"text":"If you like waiting 15 minutes everytime you want a drink, then this is the place for you!
I'm not saying it's a bad place, but everytime I've been there it's been PACKED,  and it just seems like there's never enough bartenders. 
They do however have a nice patio..."}
{"text":"I don't drink at all, but I love to eat, so it speaks volumes that I would love this bar! Both my husband and I had a hard time choosing what we wanted as an entree due to all the great choices, but I went with the taco Mac n cheese bake. Sooooo good and hearty, and no way I could eat it all. Very shareable. My husband had the Philly cheese wrap with the onion straws and tator tots but only could eat half though he loved it. We had the Hooley Hunks with tarot tots as an appetizer and those were juicy. Can't wait to come back and bring our daughter. Kid and family friendly too."}
{"text":"The wings and drinks were awesome. Had to wait about 10 mins to get seated so we had to seat ourselves. Mia was great as our server and made it worthwhile to visit. Plenty of tvs. Speed could be improved but would def go again"}
{"text":"Wait staff were very attentive. Food was very disappointing. Tasted like everything was either not fresh or out of the can. Chips out of the bag and cheese out of the can. I could've had that at home. I heard the Hooley hunks were awesome but seemed very tough and chewy to me. 
Good atmosphere with plenty of TVs but if food is your thing, you would be better off eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"You're average burgers and beers kind of place, prices were good..next door to the courtyard marriott westlake so that's how I found myself there.  Bartender made an awesome from scratch Bloody Mary though so kudos to Cara I think that was her name."}
{"text":"Come here a lot , girls always friendly good drink specials burgers good, but Shepard pie is not good, lol had to say that because of another comment, the rest of meals we had are decent"}
{"text":"1/2 price apps and happy hour all day on Monday. SUCH a good deal.

I came here yesterday for a quick early dinner with my boyfriend. We collectively decided that this was our new place.

I love the atmosphere. Everything is clean and open. There are even a few arcade games in the back to play. It has the ambience of a sports bar without being as grimy as a typical sports bar. 

Our server, Sara, was attentive and friendly. I ordered the carnivore tots. Have you ever put something in your mouth and thought \"Wow, this is brilliant.\"? Yeah... this was that experience. Those tots are amazing. My boyfriend got pretzel sticks and cheese as well as buffalo dip. Both were amazing. Our food came quickly and was delicious. Our drinks were cold and refilled quickly! 

On top of the above average service and delicious food, the Monday deal was unbeatable. The price is amazing and this is definitely going to need to be one of my go-to spots!"}
{"text":"I would like to say the food is really good. The prices are good. 
I have been to every restaurant that has ever been in this building and was hoping eventually someone would figure out that the high open industrial warehouse ceilings don't work acoustically.  When it gets full of people it is so noisy you can't have a conversation with the person next to you. 
Also it is cold and drafty in the winter months. We went to see a band last night and were so cold I couldn't wait it leave and get warm. 
The young man managing didn't seem to think much of it when I mentioned it. We were also seated near the patio entrance and got the lovely odor of cigarettes every time the door opened.   Yuck! 
But like I said, food was good, service was good, price was good. We just can't come here when crowded or cold out."}
{"text":"I stopped in for dinner after not eating all day. I was in town for work and stayed at the Marriott across the street. I say at the bar and noticed right away that there were a lot of regulars! 

I ordered half order of the hooleys hunks with firecracker sauce and garlic Parmesan tater tots. 

The sauce was not hot at all! I couldn't believe it, it was more like a mild sauce at the firecracker is supposed to be their hottest.

The tater tots were ok, fell apart when you tried to pick them up with a fork which is weird.

The staff was friendly and fast, and there are ample tvs. 

I probably won't be back since I don't live near by but if I did I would give it another go."}
{"text":"We had excellent service.Reservations were recommended on the website for a large group like ours and I'm glad we called. Pub style food and sports bar atmosphere was what we had in mind. My expectations were exceeded. The food was 
great and served piping hot. Boxty was one of the 
Dishes ordered, yum! Onion rings hand made, not frozen, large with a crispy light coating. Check out the website for the menu.
The location is between the interstate 90 and rte 2
and convenient for folks to come out.
Family,friends, great food and not too pricey drinks!
Hope we get to Hooley House again soon!"}
{"text":"My friends and family came for the trivia, and have been going for over a year now.  We love the food and friendly service.  

The boneless wings (hooley hunks) will forever spoil all other boneless wings.  Great burgers, salads, and sandwiches, and also surprisingly good veggie side dish if you're trying to keep it healthier.  

They also have macaroni and cheese bakes and melts but I can never get away from the french onion soup or hunks enough to try something new.  Definitely recommeneded for a delicious and casual dining experience."}
{"text":"Honestly just don't go here. I worked in the kitchen and witnessed with my own eyes a cook blow his nose throw away the napkin then grab a pickle and put it next to a burger. Unless it's a salad just don't."}
{"text":"Excellent food great atmosphere. The first thing that struck me about the Holley house was the pleasant atmosphere. It took a bit to be seated as the hostess was otherwise occupied. 

I enjoyed a Killian's red with my meal. They have a large selection of draft and craft beer from the area but they are not a brewery themselves. They have an interesting selection of Guinness combos. Any one not familiar with Guinness knows this is a strong beer. 

The menu was chocked full of an eclectic mix of Irish goodies and some American goodies. I settled for a a stuffed boxty.  Google it, good grub. This was the Irish boxty which meant it was stuffed with cheese and some of the best prepared corn beef. The boxty was served with a Holley house sauce and sour cream. This was good, a tad greasy but I think it is meant to be that way. 

The server was extremely friendly and efficient. You really cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Service is good, food is good, good drink selection. It's a place I trust to be a pleasant experience, and would suggest over some of the similar dining options in the area (Lookin at you, Quaker Steak). Firecracker Ranch Hooley hunks and a Guinness or two are my go to here, but I've yet to taste anything here that wasn't delicious. Corned beef is a must try. Knock a buck or two off the regular priced drinks and I'd give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times in the last month or two. Twice for lunch with family and had good service and the food (breakfast once and a boxty once--both very good). Love the patio in good weather. The fireplace is a nice touch. My daughter liked it so much the first time, we came back with one of her friends two weeks later. 
Last night, my experience was lukewarm at best. I sat at the bar with a friend. It wasn't super busy, but there was a decent crowd. The female bartender was less than attentive to us or friendly. The male picked up the slack, though. I ordered the Buffalo chicken wrap with broccoli. The broccoli was excellent. The wrap, horrid. The chicken in it was sparingly added and there was about a quarter cup or Buffalo sauce dumped into the lettuce and tomato mixture inside. I had to squeeze the sauce out to eat the first half and then only ate the chicken tidbits out of the other half. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I had the most burnt and dried out cheesesteak today. I understood it was served on Naan bread instead of a bun, which is totally fine. But the whole thing was dryer than a desert and actually burnt. I only at half because the second half tasted like charcoal. Loaded fries SO over done that it was a solid brick of potato with no other flavors. Had to slather in ketchup just to choke it down. Hubby had an Irish melt that had no flavor.

AND the wait staff sucked. We waited forever for our check despite asking another waitress to fetch our waiteess. We watched her stand at the front and just talk to the hostess. Had to then ask the manager (or someone saying they were a manager) for our check because our waitress was up font chatting. He said, \"Gotta love that.\" On our way out he simply said \"Sorry dude.\" Yeah... me too! $34 for this experience??

This place used to be mediocre at least, despite being a bar. We certainly won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Stuffed Irish boxty was real good. It had corned beef and cheese in it. I recommend it to-go cause the service isn't that great. When we came in the hostess was sitting down eating and looked confused that we wanted a table.. Nobody really seemed happy to be there. The server forgot about a quesadilla for 40 mins but took it off the bill. You could tell it was sitting for a while then maybe got heated up b4 serving. I also ordered cheese sticks but they were under cooked and soggy. I didn't even eat them. Prolly could of used 2 or 3 minutes longer in the fryer. Those were not taken off the bill. All in all the Boxty was awesome and if you want to eat from here maybe get carryout."}
{"text":"Just received my order via Grubhub.  Missing Hooley hunks and potato skins.  Missing 50% of the order is inexcusable.

Who checks these orders before they are picked up by the delivery service?  Need an improvement in your order efficiency and quality checks before these orders go out the door."}
{"text":"The location on 306 is a great place little loud at times but hey its a pub. The food is your typical safe bar food that rates above normal bar standards. It is kid friendly too so don't fear your child being subjected to bar atmosphere silliness here plenty of dinning space away from the bar area."}
{"text":"Great bar food and the reuben with Hooley sauce was amazing. Probably not great for my heart or pant size but amazing nonetheless. Worth a visit for sure"}
{"text":"I always feel like I'm entering a cave. Very dark interior, black ceiling and few windows. Service is sporadic with high turnover. New menu that eliminated soup by the cup. The regular pub food is good and the portions on the large side. Full service bar. Looking forward to being able to eat outside on the patio."}
{"text":"This review is based on just one quick visit so keep that in mind.  We met some friends at the bar before a local, high school playoff football game. The crowd was boisterous and fun and the menus looked good!  We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is next to the hotel I stay at whenever I travel to Westlake for work. Great place to watch sports but the food is not very good and the drinks are vwry ateong but not that great. The HOT wings were not spicy at all. The tots were good...but how do you ruin tots ;)"}
{"text":"First time here and the staff was super friendly. We had dinner elsewhere and wanted a nice cold beer. Definitely will be coming back to watch the Ohio games and SF ..."}
{"text":"Both the service & food at Hooley House was good. Very reasonably priced. The atmosphere is rather dark & very loud. Though you will find Irish fare & beer on the menu, this is not an Irish pub. I've been in many authentic Irish pubs and this place doesn't even come close. That's not to say Hooley House isn't a decent sports bar. This place is ideal for a large group of beer drinking hungry guys to gather after playing ball or to watch the big game with a few buddies but not so much as a dinner & conversation destination.

If you found my review useful, please indicate that below."}
{"text":"The only reason they got a two was because the bartenders were great!!  That is another place that will be shut down soon.  Never got a table after being told 30 minutes.  2 hours later we had to go eat next door.  Tables open all over the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is decent with okay service, but the inside reeks like cigarettes. I don't now if it is how the smokers linger outside the doors or the employees or what, but the place stinks. I won't be back."}
{"text":"STAY HOME AND SAVE YOUR MONEY!   or go elsewhere if you want good food.  Ordered a corned beef sandwich a Reuben  2 onion soup and mozzarella sticks for take out was $43.00 asked for xtra pickles on side DIDNT get any asked for mustard on side DIDNT GET ANY asked for xtra 1000 island dressing DIDNT GET IT.  Corned beef was dry and bland bread was stale sour kraut was like eating dental floss! Thankfully they put very very little on it. And cheese was non existent. As far as I could tell neither of us wanted to finish or save what was left of our very small sandwiches. The only good thing about them was that they were small. Cuz if they were really big and had to throw away more than half the sandwich I would be pretty peeved Mozzarella sticks were ok but hardly worth the $$  they charged and somewhat undercooked  soup was only good thing we got. Webb sight says to inform hostess you are there to pick up an on line order I did so and was rudely told take out orders were to be picked up at the bar. Bar maid was very nice.  Food was ready and that was the only nice thing about my visit here."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Great food great service!! Been going there for 5 years. The best time is Friday/weekends late. The only downside for this great pub are the jerks who bring their kids to the pub turning into Chuck e Cheese."}
{"text":"We had the best time tonight on the patio. Nick and Amber were great, always attentive if we needed anything! Love the Jim and Eroc!"}
{"text":"The service is good, not great.  It gets busy but there is enough going on there that you don't notice that sometimes the server is missing.

I love the hooley hunk salad.  I get it every time.  You can't go wrong.  And tater tots?  Not just for kids, but help ward off a buzz....It's barfood, nothing revolutionary.    Go, get some drinks, enjoy the 452 TVs.  Parking is great, but the place needs a good cleaning.   Bathrooms have a curious bouquet."}
{"text":"The menu was a little different but included some typical pub fare. My burger and fries were decent. My wife had the Mac & Cheese. She said the flavor was great but there was way to much cheese. My waitress was very good and we even had a second (superviser?) check in with us at the end. The place is extremely loud. If your looking for a quiet dinner, it's not for you. The bars were packed. The tv's are everywhere so you can see your game from anywhere."}
{"text":"I wouldn't wish this meal upon my worst enemies. My mom and I ordered the steak and hearty Irish bowl. The meat legitimately looked and tasted like it was harvested from the local horse down the street. 

Health inspectors should take a look at this place."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Yes, the Finals are on but the bartender could not have been much ruder.  Sat at bar with debris from previous customer for better part of 10 mins.  Hard to ask for menu and drink.  Big events should have the A team of staff....definitely not working tonight."}
{"text":"This is one amazing place to have before we leave town. I got the hamburger with bacon, onion and mayo with cayenne fries. My wife got the chicken quesadilla. Both of these meals were very delicious. I really hope one of these come to our neighborhood. I wanna eat there again very soon."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go out on a Tuesday night.  Open mike night is fun.  I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I give it four stars, but really this place can be so hit or miss. The lunch special for $5 is a great value. A side of fries and a good portion of Hooley Hunks in your preferred sauce. I mean, for five dollars, I'm never going to be overly picky about what I am eating giving the price I paid for it to go. However, some days the food (like today) was just decent at 3 stars, some days they nail everything and give you a little extra then you paid for and it is 5 stars. 

Really is so hit or miss. Overall though, if you haven't tried their very small boneless wings (Hooley Hunks) I recommend you give it a try during the lunch time special. During the rest of the time most of the other food is overpriced given the quality and taste of it."}
{"text":"First interaction was with a very rude women when we asked if we could sit at higher top tables around the bar.  She said please see the hostess....we replied with there wasn't a hostess and was told to go to the hostess stand again....  The place wasn't full at all; and had many empty tables.  Thankfully a nice women sat us at a hightop we wanted and our sweet waitress quickly greeted us and got us beers.  Meanwhile the rude women is smoking a cig and drinking beer at the outside bar.  Great place for a beer and to watch a game; which is the only reason we come here.  The fries are great too. Our waitress savannah was awesome."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch after traveling all day. I was able to try a lunch special, which was a burger and fries for a great price.  They have other reasonably priced lunch specials but I was in the mood for indulgence and a burger is what I went with. 

Service was very friendly and the atmosphere was the same. Seemed like a regular crowd and a lot of conversation by people who seemed to know one another, so it was relaxing. 

The television screens are not only big and plenty but crystal clear to boot. 

So, my food was really good, the service was extremely friendly and the atmosphere was great.  I think I captured it all. If you are in the area, stop in and you will likely be glad you did, like me."}
{"text":"Wings were good and hot but the tater tots were the best. I would recommend not getting the mac & cheese. It's not fresh or homemade, it's frozen then baked. Not a good taste.  We will go back and try the sliders next time wit tater tots."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, but every now an then your waiting awhile for your waitress after your seated and thy get your bill wrong, and you wait ten more minutes for your drinks, but it's pretty good all around, except for the service."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon to watch some basketball, have a beer and an app to snack on.  Service was friendly and the food & drink was spot on.  The boneless wings are the best I've had in a while.  Looking forward to trying it for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend coming here. I have worked in the service industry for many years of my life so I understand what good service should be. I also understand this is a sports bar and not a 5 star restaurant but our experience was beyond sub par. We came in around 10pm on a Saturday night.  Several of us asked for water which after multiple times of asking water pitchers were dropped off but some of us didn't even have cups. We ordered 4 appetizers for the table which after about 20 minutes 1 came out. Fast forward another 15 or 20 minutes food starts coming to the table. I ask if those are the appetizers we ordered and our server said no the kitchen got too crazy- needless to say we never received the other 3. Then our server brings half of the tables food. By the time the rest arrived those people were already done with their meals. One person was over charged for their meal, another had the incorrect beer brought out and my salad has brown pieces of lettuce in it. In all, save yourself the time and go somewhere else with better service and better food!"}
{"text":"Well is douchey to say I was pleasantly  surprised  with this  place smack down in the middle of suburbia. Beer was cold, service was excellent, drinks could been a bit stronger.  I can say the Cobb salad was on the high side of excellent. Veggies were fresh, chicken perfectly cooked and tossed in  hot sauce(per my request). They even had a local cover band jamming out. 

I would comeback."}
{"text":"This place was a whole bunch of fun.  Great food, excellent service and a fun atmosphere.  Not a bad seat at the bar to watch a game!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. My fiance and I checked it out on a Friday night recently. Sat at the bar. Service was great. Food was so so. I ordered the Kentucky Bourbon and my fiance ordered the Hot. Usually I cannot eat the hot but his were very under sauced. Mine were great. Also ordered the onion rings...huge serving/order. We will try it again...maybe for a sporting event or something."}
{"text":"Great atmoshere but same old bad food just like everything else that has been in that building.  Way to overpriced and just plain mediocre."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere was outstanding, Olivia was awesome!!! We were there for Deepwood charity, ordered the chicken chunks and they were dry and chewy, over cooked. Usually I get these just cause they are so good here! The sauces were spot on, not enough celery with blue cheese. Hooley house is typically really good so I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad. Went there for OSU/Michigan game. Service was slow. I understand a big game but had to hunt waitress down multiple times for drink."}
{"text":"What a fun place!! They have a huge selection of food... Burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings... and they had a BUNCH of mac & cheese options!! I ordered the Hooley special reuben with Guiness beer battered onion rings. It was AWESOME! I couldn't eat the whole sandwich. Of course, maybe that was because we ordered pretzel bites for an app :)

Good beer selection. Friendly service! Great overall time!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Not only was our waitress quick but courteous and friendly. She gave great suggestions and rechecked on ingredients for a food allergy. 
Only reason why not 5 stars is a cold draft from the windows on a cold winter day."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, music and really fun people. Love the Hooley hunks, love the Smithwicks on tap too. 
A few Irish favs that are good and the pizza is fantastic. My fav is the turkey w a twist and the pretzel bites. Everything between $5 & $10 so great value for big portions."}
{"text":"I am going to give the Newly Opened Hooley House Westlake two stars as it is newly opened and they did try hard.   But it just wasn't enough. 

We got there at 5:20pm.  So not overly late at night.   The lot was packed and parking was way in the back.  So a long walk with two little kids to carry.  

Went in and we were told they didn't know how long for a table.  They couldn't give us a time.   Ok. That kind of sucked.   We ended up waiting till 6:15 to be seated.   All the while many other groups of people we're coming in and just walking right in and grabbing seats.  Oh and by the way, one of our dinner party guests had already left cause he was getting tired of waiting.   

When we were told about the seating they said well we have a booth and a table.  The tables on the floor and it's lower than the booth.  Ok.  Kind of silly.   Especially given we had little kids.  It was either that or we would be leaving as they had no clue when we could be seated.   

Sat down and we were waited on multiple people.  Regular servers, managers, servers and managers from another restaurant.   So that was nice, that they knew there was an issue.  Which one of the younger managers said he wanted to buy a couple appetizers for us for the wait.  That was fine and all but it took thirty minutes to get them!  

Waiting and waiting.  The water tasted like well water.  Had that metal tinny taste.   

I didn't have any appetizers but I was told they were good.  

Meal arrives.  I ordered a cheddar bacon burger.  Medium.  Burger was cold and was well done.  Also has everything on it even though I asked for it plain.  French fries, ice cold.   In fact some weren't even cooked! 

Others dinners were better including them being cooked.  Or at least warm.  

I was asked many times by staff and family how it was. I lied and said fine.  They hate going to dinner with me as my meal is always messed up. Or cold.  Or overcooked.    Seems I had both on this occasion.  

They did try hard.  I will give them that.  But it was just horrible and I don't plan on going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Mediocre service. Ordered Fisn N Chips
Fish was undercooked' told the waitress .
She returned with another plate minus the ff
Dissapointed overl"}
{"text":"The best sweet potato fries I've ever had!!!! Great service. Delicious wraps, good beer selection. My husband and I will be back soon to enjoy another meal"}
{"text":"First time here and I have to say.... I'm impressed. I keep forgetting that there is another restaurant on Sperry. My friend wanted to take me to dinner and suggested here. So I said sure... why not. The place was clean, tables were awesome, staff was great. Sat at our table and our waitress was super nice. Always came and checked on us. Made sure our drinks were full. 
I ordered grilled chicken fingers. They were sooo tender! I was really impressed. Juicy and not greasy. I got the fries with it and they were bomb! Cooked perfect. Not soggy and not burnt. We had the buffalo chicken dip for appetizer and .... I wish I could have just ate it with a spoon! Best buffalo chicken dip I've ever had! And it's a nice size portion too. We didn't have to wait long for our check either. It was kinda quiet for a Sunday. But it was also early. And like I said, I forgot about this place. Can't wait to go back and try more of the menu!! Super impressed."}
{"text":"my fiancé planned a surprise 50th birthday party for me for them to call her days before the event and not cancel her but to let her know they overbooked a browns backer party... what a joke this is we love this place but rest assure i will never spend a penny here again .... and i know allot of people too i am a vivid biker well know and famous in some parts of the country and they handled it very unprofessional apparently the browns backers asked to have their fundraiser 1 week before my party and they called my fiancé and asked if she could rebook for the following week because of this fundraiser... so i am guessing they wanted us to cancel because of money????? ... very unprofessional !!!!! and thanks for the wonderful birthday surprise!!"}
{"text":"Place is awesome. TVs. Great atmosphere. First place I've found in a while with \"normal\" drafts and not all micro brews. Sat the bar the.service was great! Thank you Sophie!! Wings were solid. Good weekly specials too. I've found a new home!!"}
{"text":"Ordered with UberEATS very disappointed. Irish folk, I love you, but you just don't have the best food. Stick to whiskey."}
{"text":"If you go during lunch definitely check out the lunch specials. I got a Cajun Chicken Melt, with fries only $6.99. Overall the sandwich was very tasty. The bottom slice of bread was slightly soggy, no big deal. The fries were cooked perfectly. The only issue is the service is a little slow, but if you are there with a group of friends and having a good time you won't notice. The restaurant was clean and the staff was polite. The restaurant was very quite tho."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying how much I love the idea and the food and drinks at this place. I enjoy the irish fare on the menu as well as all of the other options. My favorite is the chipotle chicken wrap, ordered with sauce on the side because it is too messy other wise. He usually gets a burger and suggests the steak fries as a side. The beer selection is impressive as well, loove all of the Black mixes.  With all this good being said, I HATE the atmosphere, it never fails when we go they have something going on on the stage and super loud in the microphone. Whether its people talking about high school sports for hours on a Monday or trivia on Wednesdays, which basically means you can't find a seat in the House because they are all reserved. I dont hate them for wanting to be interactive but I wish they had a separate room for doing so because if you aren't partaking in the event, it makes you want to walk out."}
{"text":"This place stays very busy. I've been there twice now and it was slammed both times. They also have lots of good sized TV's everywhere to make for a great sports bar. There was also a band playing that night and they were very good. It made for a good entertaining experience. The atmosphere and layout of this place is very nice but the food and service was a little lacking. 

We had a large group for my buddy's birthday celebration. I thought the servers were very friendly and polite but I found myself having to track them down to order a drink a few times. 

I ordered the \"Firecracker\" Hooley Hunks (Their version of boneless wings). This flavor was supposed to be the hottest on the menu. Either somebody brought the wrong wings or these are the weakest hot wings I've ever had. Please don't label things as hot if they're not. It drives spicy food enthusiasts like myself completely bonkers! These weren't even as spicy as mild wings at BW3. 

For my meal I ordered the Chipotle chicken wrap with a house salad. The wrap was a little bland and starving for flavors. The house salad was very good and fresh with crispy greens. 

I will go back to give them another chance since I remember my first visit being more enjoyable and I do love the atmosphere and entertainment. The food was a lot better the first time around as well but I don't remember what I ordered. I shall give it another go and see if the third time is a charm."}
{"text":"Food is middle of the road. Could have been hotter. Prices are a tad high for the quantity."}
{"text":"Food was ok, service and management was a disaster. The POS went down and we couldn't cash out. They were still allowing people to order and not telling anyone that there was a problem with their POS. 45 minutes later and we're still waiting to talk to a manger..."}
{"text":"As I sit here with the Ohio State game on all around us, its hard to believe that there is not a server in sight.  It's even harder to believe that people patronize this place.  It's over priced, the service is TERRIBLE, and the food is just ok.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is cause the food was edible but not great."}
{"text":"Not good. We went here a few years ago and remembered it being pretty good so we decided to one back only to be severely disappointed. We ordered their loaded tots and they were okay at first and then as we dug further into the pile they were absolutely smothered in cheese wiz and I couldn't eat it and trust me I LOVE cheese. Next came the cheesesteak sandwich and it was way over-cooked and dry. The au jus it came with had no flavor almost as if it had been watered down. I might as well have dipped it in dishwater. Service was pretty decent, but a good waitress can't fix bad ingredients ingredients and bad recipes. We probably won't ever be back."}
{"text":"I am so glad there is such a great place in the old Boneyard building. I had lunch there yesterday (Thursday). I was happy to see that there were a fair amount of customers. The set up and the beer selection (the waitress knew how to pronounce \"Smithwicks\") was great so I wasn't expecting much from the food. The food, however, was very good. I got boneless wings and my husband got the burger special. Outstanding - best boneless wings I've ever had; very fresh and not greasy batter at all. The waitress and pretty much everyone else who worked there checked on us the whole time. Very pleasantly surprised- I was expecting average and now I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"How can a \"Pub\" have stale and flat draft beer? The Blue Moon and Bumbleberry were - plus served in a chipped glass.
Artichoke and spinach dip good, but peppery, with fresh tortilla chips.
Boxty was blah, overcooked on the outside, undercooked on the inside.
Their well known mac-n-cheese is basically velveeta and mozzarella. Why bother? The fish was well below par; small, questionably cod, overfried.
Tater tots good.
Why expect much from a sports bar? There are so many great independents out there don't bother with one like this - even if just to stop for a skunky, stale draft!"}
{"text":"I'm on business trip so I would normally come here after work around 3pm when it's not too busy. Bartender is very nice and she always knew I wanted a white rajah or the bumbleberry beer. I would usually go for the special of the day or something off the lunch menu. 

When it comes to bar food I believe it's a lot better than most places. Their wings aren't bad and they make a good reuben. Having that with a pint, I'm always satisfied."}
{"text":"Hooley House has the best shepherd's pie. Hands down. The end."}
{"text":"Traveling through the area. Walked over from the Courtyard for dinner. Friendly place. Good staff and good food. Food was cooked as ordered. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Holy Big Screen Batman
We were in the Cleveland area for business and game day Sunday had the Browns playing the Chargers. We secured a high top table in the middle of the dining area, not that it mattered any. There are enough flat screens in there to heat the place on a cold winter day. Mostly on the Browns game, but a few other matchup's.
The menu was huge and we settled on a order of onion rings, sliders and a philly steak sandwich. Rolling Rock beers for all, ice cold.
The Rings and Sliders were excellent.... the philly... so-so.  
Our waitress, Olivia , was great, checking in a regular basis and keeping our bottles rotated !

The game.... Being a Bears Fan (my hometown) i can sympathize with the Browns fans as i watched a flag snatch defeat from victory on a re-do of a last second field goal.
We all shuffled out, our heads held low :("}
{"text":"The beer was way overpriced. I was shocked to get my check and see my beer cost $9. I get cheaper beer in New York City."}
{"text":"Salad was very good. Rubin was tough and dry hardly no sauerkraut. Guess we are at the mercy of the cook."}
{"text":"Great food always has fun live bands you can tell staff likes their job and are very attentive"}
{"text":"Never been to a Hooley House until last Sunday and now I know why. If you are a foody don't waste your time or money. 

I ordered mild Buffalo wings with tarot tots and my boyfriend got Cajun rub wing with side of some hot sauce. Both came out fairly quick, problem is she brought me boneless hot wings and fries. Definitely not what I ordered, just sent it back didn't want to wait for the correct order. My BF said the wings were tasteless. Like they were cooked the day before and nuked to be served again. 

For our meal I got French toast and he got the signature philly cheese steak. Holy hell how do you F up French toast??? No joke it was thin white bread dipped in a egg wash (egg mixed with water), maybe flipped once and served. Horrible!!! It came out tasteless and soggy. I paid $5.95 for soggy white bread. Needless to say I ate a few bites and was over it. My BF $11.95 philly was a small round pile of shit. Fatty dry microwaved meat with little to no mushrooms. Clearly they don't understand what a philly cheese steak is supposed to be. 

I am not a fan of glorified chain restaurants that proclaim great food when it clearly is not. Over priced tasteless, microwaved food."}
