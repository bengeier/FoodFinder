{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast! Cute and bright restaurant, great food, friendly staff, a must visit!"}
{"text":"Artisan Bistro is a lovely restaurant for a family meal. The staff is warm and friendly, and interestingly enough I'd say the same for the food! Anything you order is brilliant, and is never strange to your taste buds-- it all tastes like upscale home-cooking; familiar in the best way possible. I highly suggest ordering the churros for dessert, if you can possibly squeeze them in."}
{"text":"I live in Bridgeland and I'm surrounded within a few blocks, by some of the most wonderful neighbourhood restaurants in Calgary. I plan on reviewing all of them on Yelp! What I really like about Artisan is the    Intimacy of the space, and the warm friendliness of the staff and owners. It's the sort of place where you can drop in for an amazing flavoursome breakfast, or stop off for lunch and have an equally pleasant experience. (when a tomato tastes like a tomato and not a potato) then you know that you are in for a fresh and tasty sensation. Dinner is always a wonderfully pleasant experience as the service is attentive and the food perfectly prepared. They don't have an extensive menu. In fact it's quite limited. But every thing on offer is worth trying. Not an exciting wine selection but quaffable and acceptable quality. It's always a pleasure walking the two blocks to this establishment and having my taste buds tickled!"}
{"text":"Great location. Quiet atmosphere. Fresh tasty food, all added up to a fantastic experience at the Artisan Bistro.

I went to the Artisan Bistro for a business lunch and was not expecting any special. As mentioned previously there is a somewhat limited menu but its jam packed with plenty wholesome goodness! I was welcomed right away with a smiling face (a must for me) and was quickly escorted to my guests. There was no sense of rush in this place it was more of a sit back a relax let the lunch come to you. 

I had the seared salmon salad that including quinoa, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, avocado, and spring mix type greens. Sounds healthy, it was, and delicious. The price point is what I would consider mid-range with the salad running around 16 bucks. I wasn't Italian style full after the meal but it made me feel good. That is what the food experience is all about. I would fully recommend the Artisan Bistro for a lunch/brunch."}
{"text":"Very reliable for brunch, rarely crowded and  can almost always get a table.   Not only that, it is a white table cloth place with quality place settings and furnishings.  I'll take a decent chair over a grimy booth any day.   Some interesting items on the breakfast menu in addition to the usual omelets and eggs Benedict.

Recommend the Blood Orange Soda and the Cafe con leche (made with condensed milk) and served with a little biscotti.  

Very pleasant staff, I've never been for lunch or dinner, but it would think it would probably be good."}
{"text":"I have only made it to the Artisan Bistro twice, but have told all of my friends and made a ridiculous number of plans to take them for a weekend brunch.

Everything on the menu has a mouth-watering description and the food is largely inspired by the owners' South American heritage. My first visit was a couple of days after returning home from Barcelona, so imagine my immense pleasure at seeing chocolate con churros on the menu. The chocolate con churros were  better than most I had tasted while away! Despite having had a full meal I was glad I saved room to share a plate with the rest of the table at the end of the meal. 

Not only was the rest of the food equally delicious, but the staff are so friendly and immediately welcome you into the cozy atmosphere of the bistro. After asking a question about the coffee they used, the owner even came out to our table and presented us with a small sample of the Colombian beans they use and told us the story of how and where they source them from!

I heard a rumour they were relocating so check them out before they move! Otherwise, you'll have to wait that much longer for an amazing meal with warm and charming service."}
