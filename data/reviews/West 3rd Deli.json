Mine was the chicken Philly it was Great!  We wished we would have tried this place earlier, we leave tomorrow."}

{"text":"Great fresh sandwiches! I had the chipotle chicken and you could taste a quality and freshness difference over other places. Staff was very friendly and full of smiles even though they were quite busy. This is a great clean location to grab lunch on the go or stop in for a bit."}
{"text":"Great fresh food and awesome soup. Friendly hard working staff. Today the line was out the door, that says something about this place with all the choices downtown. Jazz is an asset to this place an remembers what I like. Prices are very fair."}
{"text":"Awesome hot sub! Bread was very fresh and the meats were plentiful and delicious. Friendly staff and quick service. And if you check-in you get a free drink and bag of chips! (medium or large size). First time here but not the last. Reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"I found West 3rd Deli on Yelp when I was staying at the Hilton down the street.  The owner, Tesh, was super nice and personable.  I was alone so we chatted while I ate the most enormous sandwich of my life.  I had the Chipotle Chicken on Rosemary bread and it was delicious.  It was so big I had 1/2 wrapped up and I took it home with me.  \"Check in\" on Yelp for free chips/drink with purchase of large sandwich- doesn't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for lunch! Offers a variety of hot and cold deli sandwiches, soups, snacks, and beverages. Plenty of seating, speedy and friendly service, and clean. Food is delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Cleveland for a conference and my wife found this deli. Little place that is a tucked into a building - worth going to!

Doesn't look the prettiest - but the food definitely makes up for it.

It is very reasonably priced, and they make it right in front of you.

Lots of options!

My Buffalo Chicken sandwich was awesome!

Will be back."}
{"text":"love supporting family-owned businesses - good variety of sandwiches and salads - i ordered a large warm turkey sandwich on sourdough, which was HUGE and an amazing deal for only $5.99 (and free fountain drink and chips with check in currently!!). fast and attentive service even during the weekday lunch rush, nice selection of meats, veggies, chips, and drinks, informal seating available inside and out. great spot to check out if you're in the area, particularly if you're here for the court house, at the convention center"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a late lunch one afternoon.

Ordered a Reuben sandwich and a bottle of water. Sandwich was made fresh and hot to order.

The sandwich was huge! I could only eat half of it and took the other half to go. Sandwich was tasty!

The guy running the place was nice.

The only thing I will ding the place on is the parking situation. There was no available parking on the street - meaning every available spot was already occupied. I had driven over from my hotel and being from out-of-town had no idea I would not be able to find a place to park. So I ended up paying to park in a pay lot next to the building the Deli is located within.

Also note - West 3rd Deli does not deliver - BUT - they have two delivery services they are partnered with - so if you do want to order and have it delivered- you can do so!"}
{"text":"Great family owned place.  Good soup and a great meatball sub!!!  I was in Cleveland for a week and I ate there 4 times.  It sounds like much but I didn't pay more than 6$ each time."}
{"text":"So good, great, quick, friendly service. Staying at the Hilton downtown, and we just needed a quick dinner before heading off to Cleveland Beerfest. The Chicken Bacon Ranch is outstanding! Shredded lettuce, onions optional, tomatoes on top. Delicious! The large is enormous, so I went with the medium size. Way better than Subway. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best deal in town! I work downtown and eat lunch here often. You can't beat the quality of the sandwiches for the price. The ingredients are fresh, and the staff is super friendly. Where else can you get a good sandwich for $5.00? Totally worth trying if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Best deli in town, hands down. Reasonably priced, friendly service, family owned; WAY better than subway, potbelly, etc. Make the right call! Also - delivers through ubereats."}
{"text":"So im on jury Duty and looking for lunch Ideas.  As an avid yelper I figure those areas should be within a stones through of the justice center. in actual fact those places within a 4 block radius are not that many for a quick lunch.  Our city has great restaurants and Deli's.  The sad part this place is not one of them.  The place is clean and bright.  I will give them that.  As stated above I went in for a sandwich for lunch.  I noticed several standard fair sandwiches that you would find anywhere and a couple really interesting selections, I.E. Chipotle chicken sandwich.  I asked for a Turkey and Roast Beef. Seems really simple however it really threw them for a loop.  The sandwich maker was a bit confused and it was a discussion on 2 sandwiches vs turkey & RB on the same sandwich.  After the explanation of 1 sandwich, I was told that my price would be $7.99 vs 5.99.  Why?  Well I would be charged for a 3 meat sandwich.  Ummm Ok. I only have 2 meats THen was asked what I wanted to sub out.  I opted for the ham taken off and agreed to the price.  Did not seem complicated but she made it that way.  Having been an old Quiznos (per others Yelp) they have the Quiznoes oven for every sandwich.   Nice touch, but they do have problems.  First of which was they put Mayo on before going into the oven.  This seemed really weird.  But hey!  whatever.  Next was the weighing of the Turkey and RB.  The turkey is low grade.  Subway comparable.  The RB however was really bad.  So much so that when they put it on the scale I was unsure if I wanted to follow through wtih it.  Not red. Not brown. just kinda fleshy grey.    I was already invested and did not want to engage in conflict over RB.  On the other side of the oven the condiment topper I thought did a really good job.  fair amount of lettuce with spiniach as an option as well.  Additionally, the tomatoes looked fresh and pickle chips were dill and they gave a good amount.  The other strange piece was that when you order a large sandwich which is supposed to be 11 inches apparently, they cut off 1inch on the bread.  Why?  What purpose did that serve?  Thats actually the part of the bread I really like and was now confused myself as to why she did that.  I sat in the bright dinning area and began to eat my sandwich.  about 2 bites in I get stringy RB that was undercooked and just flat out did not taste good.  I took it off the sandwich and proceeded to eat the turkey.  Disappointing to say the least.  I get they are trying to balance price and food quality.  Clearly they have invested in their bread which is good.  However, they need to take into account their meat quality and what is being served.  This place could do a killing if played correctly.  However, they have to up their game.  That said they have the market cornered in this area as Subway is the only other grab and go type setting around.  Bottom line.......you need to be better."}
{"text":"Nice clean spot for a hot or cold deli sandwich!  Family owned and operated! Fast and friendly service!"}
{"text":"So... a few weeks ago I had to go to the Marion building (some of you will understand this) and I had a bit of stage-fright. I walked into Karl's next door and took a cranberry juice from the cooler to help me with my Marion building deposit. The guy behind the counter says, \"Zat it? Three dollars.\" Three dollars for a small bottle of minute maid cranberry juice. I guess they  strictly abide by the laws of supply and demand. They were ready to take advantage of me and make an already bad situation worse. I'm quite sure they felt that they had a monopoly on the juice business in the area around the court house. But, ha-ha, they are not the only game in town, or, more specifically, on the block.
This past Tuesday I decided to walk about 20 seconds north of rip-off Karl's and try my luck at the West 3rd Deli. I was having one of those days where the bus showed up on time, the traffic lights kept turning green, and I didn't have to wait for elevators. My experience at the West 3rd day, however, was what truly made my day. For $5.99, I got a HUGE roast beef sandwich with my choice of cheese, veggies, and condiments. With a refillable cup of fountain soda (I chose Sobe lifewater from the tap), my meal was less than $8. I'm a pretty big guy -and this was a pretty big sandwich. This may be the first time I have left an eating establishment in the now hipster-infested downtown area FULL without breaking 10 bucks. The rosemary bread was fresh and toasty. The horseradish sauce was spicy, like how real garden-grown horseradish is supposed to taste. The meat-to-bread ratio was perfect.
As great as the food was, the service was even better. This is sort of a serve-yourself kind of place, but the people behind the counter were extremely pleasant. You order your sandwich from the girl on the far end. Then it goes through the toaster to the next lady who puts on the vegetables (I had mushrooms and peppers). Then a third person takes your money. I don't even want to say it's like subway because subway blows, but it's like how subway looks on the commercials, only in real life. The guy at the cash register said, \"Thanks, Ian\". He said my name. That made me feel important. But here's the real kicker: as I was walking out the door, he said thanks again -and AGAIN he said my name. He remembered. Little things like that make a world difference.
It amazes me that this place doesn't have a line around the corner. Good food. Great service. And, I was in and out of there in less than a half an hour. If you're stuck at the court house and only have a short time to kill for lunch, or if you just got out of the justice center and only have a few bucks for something to nosh, walk across the street to the West 3rd Deli. You too might say, \"Thanks, Ian,\" after your experience."}
{"text":"Stopped by West 3rd Deli recently for the first time. This place is fairly close to work, so I'm a little surprised I haven't been here before. I guess I just don't walk west enough.

Anyway, when I checked in, I received a yelp offer of a free bag of chips and a free drink with the purchase of a medium or large sandwich. Score! So my co-worker and I both ordered medium Italians on wheat. The sandwiches are put through an oven and they come out hot and melty. I got all the fixins on my sub and it was made quickly. 

My Italian sub was large, hot, and fresh. It was very good. At $6.99, it's a deal. We both loved it and proclaimed that we'd be back to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for the BrickUniverse convention at the Huntington Convention Center. I remember driving by this deli that is very near the convention center and decided to give it a try. I didn't really know what to order  but saw another customer in front of me ordered this great looking sandwich. I asked the lady that works there what that was, and she told me it was the Reuben sandwich, which is one of their most popular sandwich at the shop. I went ahead and ordered the same Reuben sandwich. OMG!!! That has to be one of the best sandwiches that I have ever eaten. I am a huge fan of Jason's Deli since that one is all over Texas, but now I wish there is a West 3rd Deli in Texas. The Reuben at West 3rd was HUGE and with SO much corned beef. The lady that works there was super friendly and seems like she knows all the regular customers by name. If I ever visit Cleveland, this would be a great place for quick lunch."}
{"text":"Nice quick lunch spot. Food really reasonably priced and its pretty clean too. The check in deal makes it an offer you can't pass up."}
