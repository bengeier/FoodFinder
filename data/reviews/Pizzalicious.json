{"text":"There eggplant ricotta cheese pizza is sooooo good, delivery is quick, no complaints would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Pizza delivery late 30 minutes and counting....not good.   This is my first and most likely my last experience with this place. Pizza joints are a dime a dozen in this town; gotta do better!"}
{"text":"If your looking for some authentic homemade style pizza this is the place. My buddy and I went in there for dinner after reading some reviews and were blown away by the quality of the pizza,the garlic knots, and the owner George. He was so passionate about his cooking and making everything to order with the freshest ingredients in his authentic Italian oven. He made us feel like we had known him forever and we were just stopping by to catch up. We had actually planned on taking the pizza to go but after meeting George we decided to stay. Thanks George and cheers!!!! Can't wait to see pizzalicious expand"}
{"text":"Awesome food and impeccable service! Some of the friendliest people you'll ever meet! The pizza is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The quality of both service and food here is absolutely amazing. I always get a Large box of the barbecue chicken Pizza and man oh man, it is very delicious. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place to anyone who really enjoys Pizza!"}
{"text":"I absolutely agree with previous reviews. I was about to make a pizza myself but hunger was telling me that it'll take a lot longer than take out :)

Ordered Pesto Extravaganza and Maui Maui... both were great. I usually don't eat the crust but this one was pretty palatable so I cleaned up. It is not Pizza Hut-cheap but it is absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"Best Pizza place in my area. We love this place!!   Their number has changed  702.808.9422  So be sure to call this number to place an order!"}
{"text":"Excellent pesto pizza with a perfectly chewy crust. I wish this place was in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Size Matters - excellent pizza.  Had 10 guys sharing 4 large and went through it in no time.  Only issue is size, these are much smaller than what you would typically think a large pizza would be ... should have a got 5 :-)"}
{"text":"Lots of coupon offers on website, yelp, and groupon  good prices, good food, just wish they were open later"}
{"text":"We ordered the meattza pizza, antipasti salad and Parmesan garlic chicken wings last night. As I sit here this morning having the leftover pizza for breakfast, I realize this is seriously the best pizza in town!  Truly Pizzalicious!  Looking forward to the roast beef sub for lunch!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! I love pizza and this is my new spot! Owner George is super nice and cares about his customers!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and pizza is my favorite food.  Ordered a pie for delivery and this pizza is absolutely delicious.  The crust is one of the best I've had, but don't know how they make it.  Fresh cheese and spicy sausage.  2nd time I ordered in 10 days.  This place is my new go to!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas, 12 wings and 2 pieces of cheesecake and the total was $70.  I will NOT be doing this again.  Not only because of the price but one of our pizzas did not have pepperoni, when we called to tell them they mentioned it would be another 30-40minutes for them to remake it and deliver it.  I said that was fine but I was probably going to have a slice or two from the one they had because we already waited about an hour for deliver.  
The pizza gets there and they made a smaller one than the one I had ordered which to me is unacceptable, if i paid for another size. 
I did not call back because we were already hungry but ill make sure not order from here again.  Which its unfortunate  because I love supporting small businesses. 

The lady on the phone was nice, the pizza was good but I dont think it was $70 good."}
{"text":"Speedy Delivery! Superior customer service! hot! Right out of the oven :) Fresh toppings. Definitely not canned tomatoes in this neck of the woods :) ordered a slightly complexed.. pizza ;) they got every detail and perfection on the basil!!! 

Gluten free :) #mastered :) and right around the corner! 

Management on site :) you know they are making it happen! #lv 

You know, it's a good place when your friend says 

\"I'm grabbing another one!\" 

Can't wait to try the French fry supreme!!! :) !! 


UNUSUAL BLISS"}
{"text":"Got the Meatzza, and it was pretty much completely loaded! Crust was chewy on the inside, but also had a great crunch to it on the outside. A surprisingly big menu for a little place - they also make calzones and all kinds of hot and cold subs that I'd like to try. The owner has an infectious passion for pizza that really shows all the way to the serving dish. Awesome pizza joint that I'm for sure gonna revisit."}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza here for my daughter's school, everyone loved it. So I wanted to try it myself, and I loved it !!! It's a great pizza, friendly people, and worth paying for the price you get. Next time I'm craving pizza, it will be this at pizzalicious !"}
{"text":"Mean people suck! I don't know if that's a chip on your shoulder or it's something that just came out of your hair. Maybe her hair was pulled back earlier in the day but now it looks a mess even tho it matched what she was wearing. I would think the old man behind the filthy plexiglass hired lil miss nasty with a HEALTH CARD (not that he was a kept man!) But to permit her to have an attitude as well!?? Clearly those two are doing much more than making pizza. Pass! Ps who does pizza AND subs anyway. When u fail at pizza you're not supposed to add subs next to it. Try harder or give up."}
{"text":"Excellent food & prices fits everyday budgets. I've had almost everything on the menu. Best specialty pizzas I've had in a long time. Perfect weekend spot especially if you wanna eat at home. Try everything you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"First time at pizzalicious today. The customer service was incredible! The pizza is perfectly made with toasty crust which I love. Usually I'm skeptical of trying wings at pizza places but I was very satisfied with the Buffalo wings as well. 

I can't express enough how AMAZING the customer service is!!!!!"}
{"text":"The guy that owns this restaurant is super nice always helpful.  Amazing pizza & wings !!! Fast service and great food."}
{"text":"Deserves to be noted as one of the Best Crusts in Las Vegas!!!
I was hesitant to give it a try and go with a regular brand pizza shop, but thankfully I took chance and found my new favorite pizza.
Friendly service and fresh ingredients make for a great personal pizza.
Thank you for not being another generic pizza shop!!!!"}
{"text":"best pizza delivery was prompt and the pizza was tasty also try the greek salad !! thought i was in greece lol"}
{"text":"This is the best local pizza spot! If you live in the area do not bother going anywhere else, the pizza is amazing, staff is friendly and it is my go to pizza spot for all occasions."}
{"text":"Pizzalicious is okay. Not horrible, also not fantastic. Gets the job done if you're hungry and wanting something that's quick and convenient. I wouldn't go out of my way, but if you live nearby it's not a bad option.

We got the Meatzza pizza (topped with pepperoni, bacon, Italian sausage, and homemade meatballs). It was pretty good! But nothing that particularly stood out to me.

I can't comment on delivery since we went there to pick up our pizza. We didn't have to wait long, and the service was friendly. Again, just nothing here that was especially outstanding or memorable."}
{"text":"Tried here recently, best pizza in Vegas!Cheesecake is TDF. Southwest area. Call, you won't regret it:)"}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing but their schedule sucks as far as them closing early on multiple occasions"}
{"text":"The crust on their pizza is 5 star. It reminds me of NY pizza. It is a little crunchy a little soft. 
I have tried the Margarita pizza a few times, and the mix of tomato, cheeses, basil and sauce is delicious. 
The delivery is fast and friendly. The prices reasonable. 
I look forward to trying different styles of pizza."}
{"text":"I'm going to preface this by saying I just got my pizza at 6 pm on a Friday night.  I'd never heard of this place before, but received an alert on my phone that this establishment had just been added to Postmates and it had a discounted delivery fee.  Boom!  Everything sounded divine on the menu.  I haven't had a good pizza for a minute and wasn't expecting anything great on a busy Friday night, but wow.  This pizza not only looks bomb, it arrived warm and the taste is out of this world!  The only weird thing was a note attached to my box.  I had zero clue they did their own delivery seeing as I found them for the first time on Postmates, so I will most certainly be calling it in for next time.  Come on...hoping these pics do these pizzas justice because this is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from this place.  Their pizza was delicious. The sausage smelled like it was cooked on the BBQ and their sauce was yummy.  I would definitely order again and recommend this pizza place.  One of these days I'll make it to the restaurant to dine in!"}
{"text":"I decided to give them a try and as I parked I found the place closed, even though the website said they were open at the time of my visit. I think they may have closed down the place, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Tuesday at 245PM - trying to call and get a delivery ... getting \"Google Subscriber you are trying to reach is not available\".  Still in business?  I wanted to try them, but this is not a good start :("}
{"text":"BEST GLUTEN FREE PIZZA!

By the way there phone number is wrong this is the new number 702-808-9422."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were craving pizza so I started to fix it homemade. He came in with the mail and in the stack was a flyer for this place.
Hmmmmmm...their menu actually looked pretty good so he said we should give it a try!
I ordered a Greek salad with no feta, a large Pesto Speciality Pizza with no feta and there was a coupon for a free medium one topping (with large specialty pizza) so we got a medium mushroom with no cheese.
The young lady that I spoke to on the phone was super nice and the total was about $30 before tip. 

EXACTLY 45 minutes later (as promised) it arrived at the door and WOW was I impressed...a big tip was granted, how awesome?! 

The salad was suuuuuper fresh mixed greens, cucumbers, olives, tomatoes and a really fab homemade balsamic vinaigrette.

The medium mushroom, no cheese was perfect. Super fresh sliced baby bella's, crisp but not too crispy crust and a perfect tomato sauce. Their sauce is not overpowering, not too much of any one herb. 

The Pesto pizza no feta.......wow...just wow. Same crust but it was lightly smeared (not coated) with a basil EVOO blend. I would not consider it a sauce or even a heavy pesto. Which in this case it was perfect. You could taste it was pesto but it was not chunky or gooey. The artichokes were awesome, the green peppers were perfect...everything about this pizza was perfect.

If you are familiar with Z Pizza in Seattle...this rivals that place. Flavor and quality.

On the quest for amazing pizza...I really think this place is a little gem. The secret in probably in those amazing stone ovens...
I need to actually go to the place and meet said ovens...

YUM!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Order from here about an hour ago and I have to say for a second try of this place this place is not bad the pizza was delicious and I would say a step above pizza Hut and Dominos it is delicious the wings which I got with the pizza was delicious fresh and probably the best wings I have tasted in vegas only in front of wingstop which has the best wings in vegas in my opinion. And they are not selfish when it comes to giving you the ranch and etc the only negative was the delivery driver who didn't want to give me my whole change as he was expecting me to give him a tip I gave him a tip but that's not the point I shouldn't have to give you a tip because you tell me to or how much you want I give you a tip if I feel you deserve one. Overall outside of that main gripe this will be my to go place from now on if I decide to order food from home."}
{"text":"This is our second time ordering from Pizzalicious, and both times our experience has been excellent. One of the best spot in Vegas!! The owner is super nice and personable. The staff has been welcoming and willing to accommodate any special requests. The menu offers an array of pizzas and sub sandwiches! Pizzalicious is our go to spot!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was super yummy. We ordered the thin crust pizza with pepperoni. The sauce is delicious. And probably my favorite part. With the pepperoni it was not too greasy. The cheese was perfectly cooked. They didn't add too much like some places do which was great. I would recommend. We will probably order pizza here more often now."}
{"text":"They have THE best jalapeño poppers ever!  So excited that they opened up a second location that is close to our friends house. Excellent Excellent!"}
{"text":"We just moved back to Vegas after being gone for 5 years.  We moved to a different part of town then when we lived here previously and we have been unsuccessful at finding a good pizza place until last night... this pizza is out of this WORLD!!!!  George was so warm and he really values his customers and sincerely wants them to be satisfied.  He even named a pizza after my husband!  Now I can say we finally found our new go to  pizza place!  Run to this place, don't walk!"}
{"text":"After hearing and reading so much praise for Red Moon, I was finally able to check it out when working in the area, only to find that they've been sold and replaced by Pizzalicious, with new ownership and management as well as an expanded menu increasing the sandwich and pasta options. Having never been before, I don't know how the current product compares to the previous ownership and rave reviews. However, I am a fan of Pizzalicious's other location and my food here was fairly good.

White Pie was super garlicky and tasty, but did not have the seasoned crust that Pizzalicious is known for. Staff also seemed somewhat unfamiliar with a white pie and kept asking whether I wanted to add on additional toppings. Note that a tasty garlic sauce (similar to an alfredo?) is used instead of the more traditional olive oil. Again, unable to speak on how this compares to RM's previous product.

Also ordered hot wings, which were served 6 to an order and all flats, accurate spice level. Parking lot is small but there are several tables inside and the staff seem to be working hard to maintain quality product. Not sure if it's as good as it used to be (I can't see myself driving across town like previous reviews state), but it's definitely tasty."}
{"text":"5 stars for the pizza and service. Few places have that perfect sauce that I don't know how to describe, but it's just wonderful.

Having said that, I tried their open face melt and their cheese fries, both were very underwhelming. But if you stick to the pizza, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Better than Pizza Hut or Dominos. Affordable and convenient location. 

I've only tried their pizza. Carryout."}
{"text":"Really good pizza! We were staying at Las Vegas motor home resort, delivery was quick and they didn't mess up our order like another place in the area."}
{"text":"I order one large pizza and bread sticks on Saturday pizza was ok nothing great about it. I spent 27 dollars on a pepperoni and mushrooms pizza and bread sticks I should have went to Little Caesars and got 3 pizza and bread sticks."}
{"text":"George, the owner is such a great guy. Excellent customer service. He's such a nice guy. He make you feel at home right when you walk thru the door... please check him out.. awesome pizza !!!! He make everything from scratch !!! I will deff come back and bring all my friends ."}
{"text":"Really good! Ordered a pizza from here around 9 pm. Luckily they are open. I was surprised that a lot of places in the Las Vegas area weren't open past 9. They had a variety of toppings to choose from and the pizza was delicious. I got the eggplant. (It was breaded which I love) the people on the phone were very nice. Prices we're fair.

Only giving this place 4 stars because delivery was supposed to be 45 min to an joe and it took an hour and 15 min. 

I would definetly order from here again tho."}
{"text":"Yum! Best Gluten Free crust in town! Possibly best pizza in town! They don't skimp on the toppings, which are fresh & delicious! And they deliver to my house! ROCK! Pizzalicious, indeed!"}
{"text":"Literally the best gluten free pizza crust in Vegas.  My friends got the regular crust and loved it too.  Hard to find great pizza in Vegas.  This is going to be my go to pizza joint.  

Interesting topping choices.  And great customer service."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place is rated so highly. My food was utterly bland and cold. I didn't bother calling for a remake. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"really good pizza they are open every day from 11-9 now the new owner is always on site"}
{"text":"Burnt soggy and uneven . Greasy to the point the box it came in was soggy . Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is so good, I came twice in one day! (That's what she said?)
I popped in for a solo lunch and snagged the personal Eggplant Ricotta pizza with added pesto. Love that seasoned crust and the pesto made it pop. Everything was made to order, including the eggplant. The personal size is huge and I still had a slice left.

Dinner plans were a bust so I took a Family Meal special over to a friend's house for a group gathering: 1 large 1 topping pizza, 6 wings, and 6 garlic knots for $20, not bad at all! Even adding a second topping, tax, and tip, was still like $25. The 'za was devoured, the hot wings were fought over, and the garlic knots are dusted with powder and served with sauce rather than the dripping, buttery kind. I still enjoyed them and didn't feel like I was gaining a pound a minute. 

Location is kind of hidden but they use street side signage for specials. Service is super sweet and the two gals who helped me both visits were attentive and friendly. There are a few tables inside and a couple outside, but they seem to specialize in delivery."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The pizza was as New York style as you can get from the desert. The service was great(as I took it out to go). I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Delicious pizzas! The jalapeno poppers are to die for! I'd only wish delivery was available more often, but it is a small shop."}
{"text":"Best pizza we've ever had. Ever. We ordered a gluten free with pepperoni and sausage and a tossed crusted with pepperoni and ricotta. The room fell silent!! Apizza arrived piping hot and delicious. Every single ingredient tasted fresh and amazing. We are thrilled!!"}
{"text":"The service was absolutely amazing!! They were so accommodating and caring!! When you walk in it feels like you're talking with friends and their enthusiasm about their product is absolutely refreshing!! The pizza, cheese sticks, and cinnamon knots were to DIE for. We absolutely will be back!!"}
{"text":"We came in Saturday at 5:30 with nine of us to dine in. This place had good reviews and we were celebrating my 8 year old's birthday. We ordered our food, which was quite a bit, and waited. They had a new person running the cash register so ordering took a minute. However the wings came out quickly, then the garlic knots....which I must say were awesome! When we got our pizzas, and calzone everyone devoured them. The crust is nice and light, the sauce is truly yummy, and the sausage top notch. Being new to Vegas, this is our new pizza spot. The owner is friendly, and accommodating. Great food!"}
{"text":"Came here with the family and this place did not disappoint. The kids and I enjoyed their mushroom pizza and wings. There was so much flavor in the food. My son actually ate the crust and he is a no crust person. That right there sealed the deal for us. Everyone on staff had a smile on their face and made us feel welcome and it was nice and clean. A definite bonus for us to come back besides the awesome food. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"We ordered Pizza from here because they deliver to Mountains Edge - I am so glad I read the reviews and decided to order.  We got the pulled pork bbq pizza and Omnivore - WOW.  The crust is great - very flavorful and filled with herbs.  The sauce was the perfect amount on both pizzas. The pulled pork was tender, good portioned and YUMMY!  The meat and veggies on the Omnivore - plentiful and again - very yummy.  We will be ordering again from here even though a little pricier.  It was worth it."}
{"text":"I'm lactose intolerant so I order pizza without cheese.My review is based solely on the quality of the toppings and crust.  This places crust is perfect and the vegetable toppings fresh. It has my 5 star review.  If your crust jockey you'll enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Yummy stuff...had the X-Large Omnivore. Fed 3 adults perfectly."}
{"text":"I bought a Yelp Coupon to this place a while back, $10 for $20 worth of food and was super excited to check it out based on a few of the reviews but when We drove accross town to get there we found out they were out of cheese. 

About a month later when we were back in that neighborhood we tried again, and Im glad we did. 

We had an appetizer with hummus and pita bread, cucumbers, pepperchinis and olives. The homemade hummus was delicious and the pitta was warm and soft. it was a very tasty appetizer especially with the cucumber and olives. 

The pizza we ordered was called \"hearty veggie\"  It was a white pizza using Alfredo sauce . Artichokes, garlic, onion and some other ingredients made it a super tasty pie, I added a little sirracha to mine and was in heaven. 

The atmosphere wasn't spectacular, it felt very crammed and messy, but we ate great pizza and thats really the most important thing. Plus the staff were very nice, the pizza maker was proud of his pizza and put a lot of love into it.  I like that. 
We will be back. but probably take the pizza to go. :)"}
{"text":"What can I say. This place is simply phenomenal, to start off they have two original brick placed pizza ovens which makes there pizza taste so delicious as well as keeping the cheese nice and hot. 

I went into this place expecting pretty delicious pizza and I was not disappointed at all. I bought for a small moving group and everyone loved it. The crust is thin but thick all in one cooked to perfection.

The sauce. Oh the sauce. It is homemade and using it to dip the garlic knots is like dipping a magically toasted bun of perfection into a sauce that has traveled the galaxies more than once to get its perfect flavor. Definitely get extra.

The pricing is great as well I bought for a small group and spent about $20 and had leftovers for tomorrow.

On a last note I love that's it's close and the owner George is so awesome, he gives great service to his customers!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give one star but they were really nice. Honestly the wings were awful and completely cold.  The garlic knots were gross. The pizza crust was good but the actual sauce and pepperoni tasted awful. I feel like I got someone's food that had been left sitting all day. The toppings weren't even cooked. My search for a good pizza place is still on."}
{"text":"Got a menu for Pizzalicious a few weeks ago and wanted to try it out because of their large selection of specialty pizzas. I was browsing Yelp and saw they had a $10 for $20 special, which gave me more incentive to give it a go. Got the Greek Marathon specialty pizza, which was a \"Must Try\" without onions. Instead of red sauce, I picked to switch it to a creamy garlic sauce. Delicious. The staff got straight to work and had it done within ten minutes, which was super nice. I tend to only get cheese pizzas, but I thought it would be a crime not to get something different. Luckily, I was in the right to choose something different for once. It tasted like... biting into a gyro without the meat. The garlic and feta combo was perfect! 

The only thing to complain about is the decor. It screams old pizza joint which I thought was weird because they just opened. I didn't really mind cause I was grabbing it to go, but it struck me as odd. 

But overall, it was a spectacular expedience with the food and staff. I will definitely have to come back to try other pizzas soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place... the pizza is authentic. The crust is my favorite especially the bubbles on the crust. If you love pizza you should definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in all of Vegas! I'm not a crazy pizza critic but out of all the one I've tried... Metro Pizza, Russo, Fat Moes, Happy Pizza and Naked City... Pizzalicious is by far superior. They have variety on top of more variety.  Every time we have ordered delivery they are earlier than expected! Very friendly. The food yum. Simply it's delicious."}
{"text":"We order pizza for delivery from here for work and we come here for the subs.  Best chicken Parm and Meatball Parm I have had in Vegas.  The owner is very nice and personable.  Glad this place opened close to work and delivers.  Prices are fair too!  Feed three people lunch for 30 or less and you leave full!"}
{"text":"So good! I have Celiac disease so I can't have gluten. They had so many options and I was able to finally have a really good pizza and salad without the worry of getting sick. Everything was fresh and delivered quickly. I'll be back here again for sure!"}
{"text":"First time here, this pizza place  has big  size served and excellent food, we try the personal pizza, calzone and the steak and cheese, everything its delicious, homemade and fresh taste, everybody is so nice, the place it's little bit hidden."}
{"text":"I lived in Vegas many years and pizzalicious is the best pizza i had in years. The crust is like a new york bottom and chicago pizza combined."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time while running some errands in the neighborhood. My wife and I split a small pizza with pepperoni and ate in the store. The cheese was super melty and stretchy, the pepperoni was plentiful and the crust was flaky, crispy and perfectly cooked. It might be my favorite pizza crust in the city. The guys working behind the counter were super friendly and our food came out extremely fast. I will definitely be eating here again. I don't know if I could ever get enough of that crust."}
{"text":"Totally delicious and wonderful service. Great deals. Open late. Has an A grade from the health district. Huge variety in food and drinks. The canned coffee by Cafe Time is pretty good."}
{"text":"I dined at pizzalicious back in November and I've been craving their wonderful food ever since!   We greatly enjoyed a custom topping pizza and some hot subs.  It was the best New York style pizzeria food I've had since I left NYC.  Even better yet, was the service we received from the owner himself!  A very gregarious guy, originally from NY, takes extra care of his customers.  

Next time I travel to Vegas, I look forward to returning to pizzalicious for both their delicious food and to say hi to my fellow New Yorker."}
{"text":"Actually had amazing prices && the pizza was delicious. alot smaller than expected , it's more of a quick stop place but good pizza"}
{"text":"Had delivery Friday evening. My first time trying it and the pizza was amazing. Love the crust. I will be ordering again."}
{"text":"Is this place still open?
The phone keeps ringing nobody answers then goes to a voice mail the google subscriber you have reached is unavailable...

Was good pizza though"}
{"text":"I had delivery today and ordered a Calzone it took over an hour to get to my home when I was told 45 minutes.  The calzone arrived burned along the entire top. Why this even left the restaurant is beyond me. I called and complained and was disconnected by mistake. I called again and the manager apologized and offered to remake the calzone. I said I didn't want to wait another hour she offered a free medium pizza next time I returned.

After pealing off and discarding the burnt top of the calzone the inside stuffing was very good as it should be.  I'm not sure what is going on here usually this place is very good but based on my experience today It only worth two stars."}
{"text":"Trash!!!!! Food and service never eating here again terrible!!!! Regret it save your money and stomach not worth it."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I were craving a cheese pizza, but didn't want to use the normal go to pizza places so I started checking out places on Yelp. I came across this place and boy were we happily surprised!! Both pizza (we got the margarita pizza) and salad (Caesar) were ahhhmazing. Grub hub delivered it speedily and the pizza was HOT when we received it & the salad was crisp!! We will definitely will be ordering from this place again. So glad to have found this place. So glad we didn't just go with the normal pizza places. We definitely recommend you try."}
{"text":"Kind of at the mercy of yelp since were out of town and looking for some good pizza delivery place. The fans hit a homerun on this place. Old-school crust and delicious ingredients. Plus our delivery guy was five minutes early. Outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"There is no question that Pizzalicious make an excellent pizza, in fact, one of the best I've had in this area.  The problem is that they are completely unreliable when it comes to being open.  I've experienced them closed on Wednesday's, on Thursdays and now it's Tuesdays.  They're not doing well because they are way too casual about operating a business, especially a restaurant.  Too much competition for this to be a hobby...  

I've given up trying and am on the hunt for a new favorite - trying Bruno's tonight!"}
{"text":"Just finished eating the BEST pizza that we have been able to find in Nevada!  CHEESY delicious and fastest delivery ever!  You can stop looking at reviews, we are from NEW YORK, the land of wonderful pizza and truly thought we would have to fly back for a great slice. Awesome customer service, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Totally PIZZALICIOUS!!!!We loved it. We love the garlic ball bread too..super delish!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Vegas staying at the Delano (a part of Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino), and we decided we wanted pizza.  We found Pizzalicious after googling and decided to give it a shot.  Without a doubt, it is one of the best restaurants for pizza I've ever experienced.  The veggie pizza with its scrumptious garlic-coated crust was so good, we went back the next day for a second round of pizza before we drove back to LA.  

If you want an excellent pizza made by a true New Yorker, visit Pizzalicious.  You will come away completely satisfied with a desire to go back for more."}
{"text":"A little on the expensive side....BUT...well worth the price as this is some kick ass pizza!!! The best in town..."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Las Vegas!  Great fresh ingredients, prepared well by a friendly staff.  What more could you want.  Great crust-firm without being rock hard.  Eat in or take out.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Customer service is amazing!
Pizza is so good and not swimming in grease! 
Perfect for my pizza cravings without having to worry about getting sick after from my morning sickness because it's so fresh!"}
{"text":"Garlic bread with cheese it so good! Smell like garlic the rest of the day but totally worth it!! Good pizza and fast!!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place so much! They make your pizza fresh in front of you! It's got great flavor and the crust is perfect. It's new sleek and clean inside with plenty of seating! They also had great homemade ranch to compliment our pizza. Pricing is very affordable and they have great specials too! I saw the owner give a customer some change to help finish her order of pizza for her kids and thought it was very sweet. Come support this small business and get some great pizza too!"}
{"text":"We're first timers here and I must say the food was really good. We had a BBQ chicken philly and the kids had a pepperoni pizza! Both were great. The owner is super friendly and welcoming. They even gave us a dessert to try out."}
{"text":"Was ok pizza.... fast delivery, very nice guys. Wings were alright but needed to be fried or something. Pizza was nothing special."}
{"text":"Yum!!!! We had pizza, bbq chicken sandwich and cheesecake all delivered to our room. Was great and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Got a large everything pizza, fried zucchini, and jalapeño poppers. Everything was pretty good, but the pizza came out burnt  (almost black) and asked for ranch that we never got..."}
{"text":"I went in here, orderd chicken delizia and BBQ chicken pizza for the first time!!! They were soo good.. I have lived here 10 years and I have not found any better pizza!! They have great prices, and really good quality gourmet pizza, baked on brick stone wood fire oven..  I will have to come back.."}
{"text":"11/16/14 
Called ahead to find out what the Gluten Free crust had for ingredients. John told me to be patient he had another customer on the other line. I told him to go right ahead, he was super polite.  When he came back on the line he mentioned they bought the Gluten Free dough from a actual bakery out here in town. It was made of Chick Peas.  I asked if they used real olive oil he said yes. I asked about Corn and he said the owner does not like using Corn meal and that there was none on the premises.

Stopped in tonight around 5PM (busiest hour). John was the only man in the kitchen. He held it down too. He took an order before us & then ours. When he served them their big order (bigger than ours 6 pizzas).  He had ours ready in the box hot & fresh to go. I was amazed he could handle the kitchen by his lonesome.

Now for the pizza. I ordered a Gluten Free ($12.99) White pizza w/ ($1) Black Olives, TO GO. The pizza was seasoned with creamy garlic sauce. It was NOT greasy, just enough oil to cook the pizza to perfection. Think about the ingredients you choose if don't want a greasy pizza.

I suggest DINE IN or TAKE OUT.  Check in on Yelp and get a free Cheesecake or Chocolate mousse. We LOVE to split the Mousse cake & enjoy it slowly. It's waaaay rich and delicious. Super good food, and makes the perfect date spot with a free slice of cake. Great staff, quiet place to enjoy a date night.

 Best pizza in town, I would say it's on the same par as Grimaldi's but WAY cheaper than buying an $18 pizza (plus toppings)."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, the service was super friendly and prompt. We ordered the all meat pizza. It was decent. The meatballs tasted \"off\" and the crust was a little soggy. I would come back if I was in the area again, but I won't be going out of my way to come here. The sauce, pepperoni were really good.

Could of just been a bad day for the meatballs and dough."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here last night and I am so glad we found this place . The pizza was so delicious . The lady that rang us up was so nice and the chef/ owner was amazing . He really knows his pizza . He was very friendly and really sweet . I will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery and showed up 15 mins early, gotta love that! I ordered the gluten free pizza with chicken, olives and feta and I must say, it's pretty darn good! It was a little on the salty side, but definitely worth trying this place again! Also enjoyed the way the pizza was cut into small squares, a lot easier to eat."}
{"text":"We ordered here for a staff lunch. 
1 Zita
1 Lasagna 
1 Chicken Parm
2 Orders of this Mayo Chicken Stuff
Truth be told the Lasagna was INCREDIBLE. I plan on returning just for that alone. 
Chessy, saucy, seasoned....yummy.  

I want to try their other Italian dishes..."}
{"text":"I work right next to pizzalicious so I always order from them! The pizza is really tasty. Much better than any other places I've found. This is a much better quality pizza than your typical Dominoes or Pizza Hut. The wings are pretty tasty too and the greek salad is always fresh."}
{"text":"It was just ok.
Ordered for delivery  2 pizzas....wings...fingers...mozzarella sticks.
Food arrived just warm. No marinara sauce with the sticks....fingers were kind of dry.
Was hoping it would be better!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was different I'm so glad we found this place . We ordered the buffalo chicken pizza . We got to watch this nice man make our food . The crust was so cuisine like the flavor just made it more interesting. We also ordered the mushrooms the batter was so good . Everything just tasted fresh ."}
{"text":"Love this place . It is far from my house but anytime I am on this side of vegas I will go here .
They have a great variety of items at AFFORDABLE prices . Budget friendly.
They have plenty of specials to choose from .
My grandson had a small pizza , I had meatball sandwich and my daughter had chili dogs . Everyone was happy.
The food is really good but to be 100% honest , no matter how good the food is - if I don't get friendly service ? I won't come back to a place . This place has friendly and attentive service so I will DEFINATELY return ."}
{"text":"They put too much tomatoes than pepperoni & onions. Pizza was better then Pizza Hut but still can't beat Alaska's Mooses Tooth Pizza."}
{"text":"Can't deliver because I can't be away from the store for 40 minutes? Wow, I guess they don't deliver. My address is within the zone(Rhodes Ranch) on their website. BOOOOO!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in this place for lunch before heading to a doctor's appointment in the area. When I walked in I noticed that they only had 2 slices of a ready made pizza left. The girl that greeted me let me know that they could make me more or anything else I like if I wasn't interested in what they had. Since I was in a hurry I opted for the lunch special of 2 slices and a canned soda for $5. I added pepperoni to the slices for an extra dollar. They also topped the pizza with some additional cheese before heating it up. The pizza crust is very unique. It tastes buttery,  light, airy, & crisp. It didn't taste prebaked. I was delightfully surprised. 

The restaurant was small but clean. The other people eating lunch inside the restaurant seemed equally pleased. When I got to my doctor's office I was almost in a food coma from just one slice. I ended up recommending this place to a couple of the nurses. The next time I have an appointment in the area,  I'll be having lunch here again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in Las Vegas. The crust is amazing. And the pizza never disappoints. Also, the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"I love brick oven style pizza! The people here are so friendly and welcoming. I ordered two veggie pizza's. They smell just as good as they taste. George is a master pizza chef. I highly recommend Pizzalicious to anyone wanting a good slice! Definitely will be coming here again :)"}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff and delicious pizza . . . fresh toppings and thin, crispy crust.  Outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"Pizzalicious is the only pizza we order from. Being that they are so busy you'll have to call a couple times to get thru but be patient they have fast delivery and the pizza is delicious and well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Pizza is good, with a light crust, and wholesome toppings (tastes real, and not artificial, like at some places).  Let the owner bake you a lasagna.  He's quite good at it! Don't overlook the garlic knots.  OH, try the garden salad, too. Surprisingly refreshing and delicious!

The place is undergoing a renovation.  It's a bit rough right now.  Once it's done, it will be a nice experience to sit there, (not so much now), and not just to enjoy good pizza and great lasagna!  He plans to include a karaoke and bar corner, too.   Parking is free and easy."}
{"text":"OMG.... Hands down the best New York Style pizza in Vegas!!!! My family and I had the special 
\"large pizza, pizza knots, and huge salad.\" The pizza was piping hot with tons of flavor. My teenage son raved about the pizza knots. The best part of my experience was the awesome customer service from the owner, I truly felt like I was in his home. Last but least it was not overly costly, once again the owner wowed us by feeding all of us for just 15 bucks. I WILL definitely go back, for the great food and awesome customer service...."}
{"text":"This place used to be good. The previous owner (although he was hardly there) made the best pizza I've had in Las Vegas. Everything was perfectly seasoned and the crust was equally as good as the rest of the pizza.

The new owner is a nice guy, but quality is way down. You can't even pick up a slice without toppings falling off. The middle just gets soggy and the toppings aren't what they used to be. 

Protip - after ordering pizza from here, reheat each slice on a skillet before eating. The crust will get crispier."}
{"text":"I cannot stress how delicious the Caramelized Pizza is!
I order it at least once a month!
I'm a pizza guy, and this is one of the best pizza's I've had in Vegas.
It's a little pricey but you get what you pay for!
Again, the pizza here is amazing! I can easily compare it to Metro Pizza and Grimaldi's"}
{"text":"Delivery is fast.  Customer service is good.  Now the most important....  Yes pizza is very good.  Wings are average. Nothing special.  I would surely order again."}
{"text":"First time winner. Just moved to the area and wanted to try a local place. I was not disappointed. Had the Pepperoni, delicious. Had the BBQ chicken, winner! Crust was perfectly cooked. Found my favorite local place for pizza."}
{"text":"BEST GLUTEN FREE PIZZA IVE EVER HAD. 

If you are gluten intolerant, order their 11.5\" gluten free pizza. SO good.

Chicken wings were a bit fatty, but still ate them like it was my job. 

Ranch on point too!"}
{"text":"Okay so George the owner is amazing. He's got a passion for food and it definitely shows. Everything I've ordered from this place is awesome, ever since this store re opened I've been eating here every chance I get."}
{"text":"Great pizza hands down. Dropped in thinking it was red moon. But no way this folks do they thang wit the sauce. My favorite pizza in town"}
{"text":"Wow. Yelp never disappoints. Driving in an area that we were unfamiliar with, I found this place on yelp and told my husband that we were getting pizza! 

When we walked in I wondered if we had made a mistake; the place was tiny and didn't really seem dine-in friendly. But, the employees were very friendly and helpful with ordering, so we ordered a plain pepperoni pizza and sat down to wait.

Their decor inside is deceiving. This pizza was so good! The sauce was very good, but the crust was the real star of the show. It was crunchy but not too hard.   I love this pizza, especially for the price! 

If you're in the area, call this place for carry out. Their employees are incredibly friendly, the service is fast, the price is good and the pizza is great!"}
{"text":"Their new number is 702-808-9422. I found it on their Facebook page. Always great pizza, the crust is awesome. Plain pepperoni pizza and white sauce with bacon, garlic, and bacon are our go to orders. They deliver farther than anyone else, all the way to Mountains Edge where we live and hardly anyone delivers out here. It does usually take about an hour but it is worth the wait. Better than any other pizza place we have had delivered out here. Really nice guys too. If you've tried to order from here and failed in the past due to the changed number, give this place another try. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Craving pizza, and we wanted to try something new. They made us feel welcome as soon as we walked in. The owner made us personalized pizzas, which were AMAZING! The co-owner was super friendly also! They make pretty much everything from scratch, can't wait to try everything on their menu! Lol"}
{"text":"One owner business and giving the best tasting pizzas you ever want to taste. that Greek Marathon with the chicken on it my most favorite and always on my order. Meat lover and the veggie pizzas also well worth to try. Pizzas are made with wood oven and backed to the perfection. highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Chili lime wings are the best! Pizza was cooked perfectly and the crust was tasty.. I would recommend this place for sure.. when we're back in town, we will come back!"}
{"text":"Ordered wings and a ceasers salad. The wings had a soggy breading and chicken didn't look appetizing. Worse salad I've ever ate. The croutons tasted like they sat in a metal bowl for a long time blah! Not enough dressing it all just tasted funky. Definitely won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. We ordered tonight thru GrubHub. When our order arrived, we were missing food and our salads were a cheap mess. We contacted the restaurant and they hung up on me. I then contacted GrubHub. The lady there was very helpful, she tried contacting Pizzalicious. They refused to fix the problem, replace the missing food, or issue a refund. Thankfully, GrubHub gave us a credit. But that doesn't compensate for the lack of care shown by this restaurant. It is disappointing at the least, that they refused to acknowledge their mistake and make it right. We order out frequently,  and this restaurant has been crossed off our list. Poor customer service is inexcusable!"}
{"text":"Found this place while in Vegas for a tournament. Thanks Yelp for the recommend!!! Great customer service. The pizza was absolutely amazing and the boneless wings are the best I've ever had. For sure will back when we are in town again."}
{"text":"One of the hardest parts of moving to a new side of town is finding a pizza place. Pizza is taken pretty seriously in our home and we are not Pizza Hut or dominos people by any means... Thanks to yelp I discovered pizzalicious and am so happy I did! I ordered delivery and received awesome service which is rare especially when it's over the phone. I ordered the pesto pizza and the fries supreme and both are up to my high standards! I live in a confusing complex and there was issues finding the place on top of it being pouring rain outside however that didn't stop the delivery guy from being extremely nice! My search for the perfect pizza joint in my new area is officially over..this place is it!"}
{"text":"The crust reminds me of a better version of Pizzeria Bianco crust (highest rated pizza joint in US).  The sauce is truly amazing, full of flavor.  Cheese is noticeably fresh.  This place is must try if you love pizza.  It's tucked behind rainbow blvd but not hard to find.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing from the perfect customer service to the delicious food!!! The pizza, the sandwiches,the pasta, the fried shrimp all of it is just fantastic!! They always get your order right and are  so helpful and friendly. I highly recommend Pizzalicious, this place will not let you down. Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"The owner here was really nice, however my pizza and wings were not. I had high hopes from the yelp reviews and pictures, but I was highly disappointed.

My pizza was mediocre and my wings were soggy and messy. I understood from the website that the wings would be oven baked, but they were so soggy and messy that after having two, I just throw them in the garbage.   

I will not be returning to Pizzalicious because I have had better frozen pizza & wings."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT Pizza !! Chef George brought his dough and sauce magic from NY to Vegas !! BRAVO - my son even gives him 10 stars !! place is in renovation but don't let that stop you from tasting heaven in a box !!"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok, garlic knots were ok, chicken wings were ok, cinnamon knots were ok..... the owner was super friendly and great customer service but because the pizza was just mediocre I probably won't go back unfortunately, I really wanted to like this place!!"}
{"text":"I have to extend my sincerest accolades and gratitude to Pizzalicious. They got me out of a jam today.  To make a long story short, I was tasked with contributing to a luncheon for 12-15 people. A personal emergency came up and I was left with 40 minutes to get hot and fresh food to our team. I walked into Pizzalicious a moment after they opened. Brad and Heather at Pizzalicious enthusiastically accepted my five pizza  and 30 wing request.  I was primarily concerned with delivering something on time....quality or taste were not priorities for this last minute mission. Well....Pizzalicious provided a tasty, quality and quite affordable solution to my last minute challenge. I will be back and thank you for helping me out."}
{"text":"Was just in there and they are renovating but open. Dining area is a bit of a mess including board with nails sticking out but that's understandable as work being done. 

Saw spaghetti And meatballs on special. Looks like it may have been on special board for a little while as chocolate worn out. I ordered it and what came out appeared that it may have been made several days ago, back when they wrote that on the board. 

Marinara sauce was darkest color I have ever seen and not very pleasant taste. Possibly burn? Meatballs were only partially reheated and a quiet room temperature and had very soggy Texter to them. Taste was not great, maybe due to sauce or maybe due to temperature or combination of both. 

Anyways I took one bite of the spaghetti and tasted the meatball And informed the person upfront that it was not at all good and explained why. He did offer to make me a pizza instead, but I guess it may have had the same problem with lack of freshness as they were more focused on remodeling. 

I told him I was going to go to eat at a sandwich shop nearby instead. He did not offer to refund the money that I was made to prepay when I ordered. Now I know why they have people pay before they eat. So I paid for a lunch that I never did get to eat, not recommended at all."}
{"text":"I stopped in because I wanted pizza and this place was close and had good reviews. 
And damn, better than I expected! I will definitely go back. The sauce, crust, and cheese made for a delicious pizza:)"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas we have had in a loooooong time!!!! Very friendly also. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Very Good pizza. .. just happened to be visiting my sister in the hospital. ..and of course you get hungry.. so what is quick and easy and Deliver. ..PIZZA! !..  I go to my trusty yelp app and PIZZALICIOUS was the 1st to pop up. . And it was definitely a Fantastic choice. . Fresh toppings, amazing crust... flavorful sauce..Wings were nice and crispy.. and BRAD was SUPER Accommodating .. a must try. . WE ARE SATISFIED! !"}
{"text":"Delivery was fast, got my order perfect, pizza is amazing and cheesecake. Im obsessed with ranch and they gave me quite a bit!!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall by 7-11.  Many transient people are walking around going to 7-11 and liquor store next door.  Pizza filled you up.  Could be better if in a safer area of town."}
{"text":"Being from out of town I had to rely on local reviews....now I know not to trust Vegas reviews.

This pizza was bad at best. The cheese is low quality and very greasy, as is the whole pizza. The dough has no taste, the sauce is pointless, and the italian sausage tastes cheap as well. 

I also ordered the chicken wings because they looked really good in photos. Mistake. All fat and skin...gross. I ate 3 of the 6 wings and that was 2.5 too many. I ate more pizza than I should have as well. 

If this stands for good pizza in Vegas I wont be eating pizza in Vegas. Cheap tasting...low quality ingredients. If I wanted that I'd go everywhere else. 

I will say the staff was nice, both on the phone and delivery. Maybe my hopes were just too high after all these 5 star reviews...but this pizza was absolutely nothing special in any way. If it stands out as good in this area...shame."}
{"text":"I had the creamy garlic gluten free pizza and I liked the sauce. The food arrived within the estimated time. The fries were not fresh, but the chicken strips were good. The food may be better if not delivered."}
{"text":"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but there is no way that this establishment deserves anything but a mediocre rating. Before I begin, I will put forth a disclaimer and say that I did not eat their pizza. If you are looking for pizza, do not read this review.  If, however, you were foolish enough to order subs, you will be extremely disappointed. The bread reminded me of leftover we made too much bread from Walmart. The Italian sub contained very little meat and cheese. Unbelievable.  Finally, as a last poke in the eye I insult, they actually used the cheap kind of roast beef that you can get for $.79. What a disgusting disgrace. So, I am not saying anything negative about the people there. They were nice. What I am saying is that this piece of crap establishment does not know how to make subs. On top of it all, it is in a really bad neighborhood. I don't have a problem with that. As I travel around, I encounter many fine eating establishments in really dicey areas. To compensate for the neighborhood, however, they need to have some quality food. This establishment does not accomplish that. I do not recommend this restaurant at all, but I give it two stars instead of one because I did not eat the pizza and because the people were OK people. Sort of. The subs suck."}
{"text":"Delicious... Wish I didn't live on the other side of town, otherwise is would be a regular.  Crust is special!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmmy! Definitely coming back here when I'm in Vegas. Hand tossed the crush was amazing and service was great and super nice staff. My new spot in VEGAS"}
{"text":"My experience overall was good here. The women that work here are extremely nice & provide good service. I ordered a pizza, as well as their chicken fingers. I was not a fan of the chicken strips at all but the chili sauce was good. The chicken strips were literally tiny & way to thinly cut, so the inside was dry & the breading kept falling off. The reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because of service & their pizza was amazing! Super delicious pizza & the crust is to die for. I'll definitely be going back for their pizza!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service .. will be returning for sure to try the pizza subs and lasagna ..."}
{"text":"I placed my order on line and after hitting \"send\" I realized I forgot to arrange to have it delivered so I quickly called. I was told that it would be about 30 minutes. After an hour of waiting I called again and the delivery driver showed up about another 10 minutes later. 
I had ordered 4 pizzas. The pizza was good but was not piping hot. My gluten free pizza actually had cooled enough the cheese was formed and fake looking. The flavor was good but not hot."}
{"text":"Wow!  Excellent pizza...the omnivore Pizza is my dad's fav.  My mom loves the cheese with extra cheese.  The regular crust is superb.  My boyfriend is gluten free--hands down the best gluten free pizza we have ever had!"}
{"text":"Great food. Pizza specials for lunch is just what the doctor ordered. Best part is talking to the owner George. Seriously the best guy. So nice and friendly. I go for the food but come back just for George !"}
{"text":"I must say I'm quite impressed! I did not expect this pizza to be as good as it was. The crust was so good that I had my sons leftover pieces. The pizza dough tasted extremely fresh and had a lot of flavor. We got a simple pepperoni, which was made promptly. 

Sadly, I don't think the place is doing as well as it should be most likely because of the odd location that it is in. 

If you're in the area I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the price you pay! Our pizza was huge and not lacking on the toppings. Not my all time favorite but we will definitely be ordering again. The chicken tenders were also delicious. The delivery guy was awesome in making sure that I had everything I needed and was happy. Their online ordering system was super easy and everything was so tempting!"}
{"text":"On point and unbelievably delicious.  It definitely lives up to its current 4.5 star ratinv it has, but it should deserve 10!  The red sauce is the best I've ever had.  Get the maui maui, trusttt.  The tomatoes taste super high quality.  The cheese is AMAZING.  But what really makes this pizza special is it's herby mouth watering FOODGASMIC CRUST.  Holy shit, I'm literally in pizza heaven typing this & eating it at the same time.  Thank u pizzalicious for coming thru in a major way!"}
{"text":"Since I had great experience last time, I decided to have pizza one more time from here. I asked for the delivery this time and I tried meatzza pizza this time, which is pretty much a meat lover. Meat felt to be fresh, and as I felt last time, it was full of ingredient which was great. Ordered Wings with hot and sweet sauce (I think this is what is called) and wing was amazingly tasty with sauce too. It took a bit longer than I expected to be, but it still was a great experience. Yeap, this place will be my delivery list for sure."}
{"text":"This pizza was a melody of flavor! Only the best and freshest ingredients, you could taste the dedication that went in to the sauce and overall craftsmanship and in excellent prices...I usually don't review gems like this because I prefer them hidden...this neighborhood joint will knock your socks off with flavor. I had the Greek marathon which is a must but try anything on their menu George is the greatest!! And he pours his soul into each one of his creations."}
{"text":"So, we had tried this place to scope out pizza for our daughter's birthday, really liked and decided to go with this place for takeout - and we were not disappointed!

I called before they even opened to put in my order, and they graciously took it even though they weren't open yet.  I ordered 7 pizzas and 4 orders of garlic/cheesey bread, and the owner or whoever I was talking to gave me a discount for ordering so much food!  It was very much appreciated too!  I had asked the pizza to be delivered around 4pm, and the delivery was right on time - it was actually there before all of our guests had arrived.  We had plenty of leftovers from the party, and the pizza was just a delicious the next day.

Definitely would recommend this to locals in the area.  And they deliver to a wide area too!"}
{"text":"I read some of the reviews months ago and decided to try Pizzalicious.  I called and ordered for pickup.  The pizza was delicious!!!  I tried a few weeks later and they were closed.  This happened 4 more times.  (I'm really surprised I kept calling.)  Then when I was going to give up completely, someone answered and I ordered again.  It was a different gentleman so I'm guessing there is a new owner.  Again, the pizza was delicious!!  I'm not from Chicago or New York so I didn't know what the big deal was with the crust.  I do now!!  This crust is nice and chewy and has such a good flavor that I'm hooked.  No wonder I kept calling!!  It's been a month so I crossed my fingers and Hooray, he's still there and he's got an awesome young lady taking my order.  She was very happy, asked for my order and information, read it back to me and said it would be ready in 12-15 minutes.  When I walked in, she greeted me with a smile which I absolutely love.  I was recognized by the owner who knew I had been there before.  What a great change!  People that pay attention, care and make an awesome pizza!!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a great, small pizza joint for a while. This place fits the bill. We only got a cheese pizza, but it was delicious and we got to watch it being made. The crust was beautiful, cooked well, just barely crisp and nice and chewy. Just the way I like it. The price was great as well. I can't wait to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Owner made it right. 

Removed my entry

There are good businesses out there

The owner of Pizzalicious cares about his customers"}
{"text":"Definitely, belongs on the Top 5 list for Best Pizza in Las Vegas. I ordered delivery from Pizzalicious on a chance that it would be good and they didn't disappoint one bit. I thought it was incredibly flavorful from the ingredients to the crust. I highly recommend this place for pizza. We had the Amour Con Pesto and the All Meatzza pizzas. 

Only downer point, is it took a while to arrive, but I willlllllll be back!"}
{"text":"I wish I had taken a photo of the pizza, but let me tell you it was all gone shortly after it arrived. Hubby asked if I ordered from the pricey place we like to go to, because they're pizza is amazing. THIS place though is sooooo good!! Will be ordering from this place again. Pizza was delicious, price was great and delivery was quick! Win!!"}
{"text":"Got the BBQ chicken pizza and wings. The dough/crust was awesome and the sauce was amazing. The wings were a little greasy but tasty. The blue cheese sauce definitely left something to be desired because the blue cheese was finely ground instead of being chunky. Might just be my own preference but I typically like chunkier blue cheese. Overall the staff was super polite and friendly. Called ahead to confirm location and the driver was really nice. A+ option if you're looking for an easy meal option and you're not wanting to go to a big chain."}
{"text":"Ordered a caramelized XL pizza which was fresh tasting and cooked properly, about 4 stars :) Definitely needed a little more sauce, barely any on it, and more shrooms for my $2 up charge.

Up charging me $2 to swap shrooms for roasted garlic after telling me $1 over the phone :(

You're a small pizza shop, who in my opinion, should swap out a topping for nothing if you want to stay in business instead of trying to nickel & dime your customers. And on top of that there weren't very many on them either.

Definitely could've been friendlier over the phone and in person, the girl working tonight. The actual dining area is small and is set up more for eating a quick slice rather than going to dinner there.

So, $26 pizza with an additional $2 for barely any mushrooms plus tax, minus $5 due to website coupon, ended up being $25 out the door. Way overpriced compared to what else you can get locally with the same quality of ingredients.

So, when looking at the star descriptions, \"Meh. I've experienced better\", was the appropriate rating."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious pizza! Service was fast and friendly. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hot and Fresh but not yummy.  I'd never ever order again.  I love pizza. It's a twice a week meal. But this was so not yumma I have not craved pizza once since I ate it last week.  I really was hopeful I'd love this place too."}
{"text":"We order a pepperoni pizza and a Caesar salad. We were not disappointed it  tasted really good the pepperoni pizza and  the Caesar salad as well. we will return again and great customer service."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place was getting 5 stars. Ordered pizza for delivery through Eat24. I could have just as well ordered from one of the pizza chains and would have gotten the same if not better pizza. It was such a disappointment."}
{"text":"We wanted a late night snack and decided to try this local pizzeria. We got a Omni pizza onion rings, and wings. Everything as delicious. The pizza dough as cooked just right. The onion rings were crunchy and the wings yummy. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My bf and I were able to meet the owner George the first time we ever tried out Pizzalicious.  He was very kind and accommodating.  When he found out it was our first time  he was very sweet and hooked up our pizza with extra toppings and told us his story of how he started and where he was from.  What I liked most was his passion for what he did and his pride for his work and his product.  It was definitely a great first impression and I loved the personalization and enthusiasm for his business. As for the pizza  it was really good the crust was so crusty and crispy you'd think it was fried, but soft and chewy on the inside .  Definitely going to continue supporting and frequenting this place any time I'm in the mood for pizza:"}
{"text":"Just got a pizza for the first time here. I didn't know that it changed ownership a year ago. Anyway, this place was pretty tasty. George the owner was there and made out pizzas himself. He told us his brick ovens are 15 years old which is exciting if you know pizza. The pizza was a nice classic old school pizza. Lightly crispy and chewy crust. Very happy to have a good independently owned spot by the house to order from."}
{"text":"It is 8pm on the evening of April 11th, 2015. My order just arrived at my house 5 minutes ago and it is horrible!!! Probably the biggest waste of money I have ever wasted. I ordered wings, mild w/blue cheese dip, and I received a sopping soggy wet mess of so called \"chicken wings\" and of course, no dipping sauce which was paid for. 

Second, I order their French Fries Supreme, which was less than mediocre. These fries came in cold and soggy and missing half the ingredients. They arrived with no cheddar cheese and no pepperoncinis.. just looks like fries with a small touch of jalapeños and some hard white substance that resembles that of Elmers Glue.

Lastly, I ordered their Italian Sub.. this sandwich is one that would make any TRUE Italian embarrassed to say this came out of their kitchen... 

DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE.. IF YOU DO, YOU MIGHT AS WELL FLUSH YOUR MONEY DOWN THE TOILET.. CAUSE THAT'S ALL YOU'LL GET.. SH¡T!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good, but cold when we got it delivered. Otherwise I think the pizza is pretty good, I would just suggest eating there instead of ordering for delivery."}
{"text":"I moved to Vegas over a year and a half ago, since then I've been looking for the best local pizza in town. 

I've found it here with the Omnivore Combo and now I'm coming back for the best pizza at Pizzalicious."}
{"text":"I recently moved to this part of town and wanted pizza delivered. I chose Pizzalicious because it had the highest ratings in the area. We ordered the Maui Maui pizza and antipasta salad which were both delicious! The highlights of the pizza were the amazing pizza sauce, which was full of spices for extra flavor, and the crust was reeeally good and I'm not a big crust person. It was crispy on the outside and fluffy inside, the toppings were also great. Mainly the meat. Which brings me to the antipasta salad, the highlight was definitely the meat and cheese! The lettuce was crisp and fresh (no icky brownish pieces) and the meat and cheese was no store bought plain old ham. It tasted like it was from an Italian deli, full of flavor. I'll certainly be ordering from them again and can't wait to try their sandwiches and appetizers!"}
{"text":"First time tonight. Stopped in on a whim. Friendly staff decent menu and prices were ok. I ordered three items. They got one right. I ordered a cold Italian sub opened it up at home it was cooked and soaked in Italian dressing. Tasted ok I ate it I was hungry but would have preferred it cold the way it was ordered. Ordered a side of fries damn they were horrible. Totally under cooked looked pale white and tasted Just uncooked. we threw them out. Could have used a decent amount of more time in the deep frier. At least the salad was correct. Don't know if I'd go back honestly wasn't worth raving about. Would be open to trying the pizza possibly."}
{"text":"I love this place and the owners are the most adorable couple ever. The food and service is great and I love the music played here and how close it is to where i live. I'm definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. Ordered a pepperoni pizza and it was burnt to a crisp. The owner said he thought my pizza was supposed to be \"well done.\" I've never heard of a well done pizza. He gave me a free dessert for the mistake which I appreciate, but only to realize I was charged for a large when I ordered a medium anyway. The new pizza he made me was mediocre. I've had better at Little Cesar's. The pizza shop smelled like sewer which I didn't understand. The employees eyes were bright red and glossy, and although I'm aware of the new legal meds we can purchase - don't think they should be making pizzas under the influence. The shop itself is located in a very sketchy place which I honestly didn't care much about until I went inside. It's supposedly a new pizza shop but if it continues like this, I don't think they will last."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town.. sure there's other places in town that serve pizza. But you walk into here and you're greeted with genuine smiles and hellos.. I met George and two other gentlemen who immediately made me feel like I've been here before. That is honestly what I look for when I go into businesses like this one. Had the wings as well, and it did not disappoint. Must visit and try!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from them once. I ordered a large half pep and Margarheta  (sp) with extra sauce pizza for about 18 bucks. they were really accommodating and above all else the pizza was DELICIOUS. it's the cheese they use. it's amazing. good experience for me."}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing!!! The crust is like no other pizza I've ever had! And the owner is one of the nicest people I've ever met! Must try!"}
{"text":"Over all good pizza. I enjoy the flavorful flaky crust. I first had the pizza at the first location on Rainbow suggested a North location and here it is . . Happy camper now."}
{"text":"I will have to say that when I called this place Marty was super cool. I felt like I knew her for years and when I got there she has great customer service. We spoke for like an half hour after I got my food. Real cool vibe and smelled real good as I walked in. This place is so worth it. Glad I came and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Owner George is a great guy. I ordered 5 min before they closed  through EAT24 and evidently I'm outside their delivery area.  Could have got the call \"sorry we don't deliver there\" and instead George delivered himself at 9:40 (they closed at 9 pm).  Pizza is delicious.  Would support a local owner with that focus on customers any day.  Thank you George!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza, wings and garlic knots. Awesome service. Will go back."}
{"text":"I'm basically housebound right now with pneumonia so thought I'd order a pizza.  They had left a card on my door that afternoon so I thought I would try.  I can't remember who I spoke to- Brad or Brian?  I ordered a large 1/2 cheese 1/2 pep saus and onion with a Greek salad.  They had a coupon for $16.99.  He said it would be about 45 minutes.  No problemo- about 50 minutes later I was wondering and they called me!  The driver had an issue at a previous delivery and was running late but he just left with my freshly made pizza.  He took $5 off for being late.  

The pizza was awesome.  For $16.99 a 3 item large pizza and Greek salad.  The pizza was great and hot and the salad was fresh!  Will definitely order here again."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I have been looking for that special pizza place out here and I've finally found it! Fresh ingredients and awesome crust! The owners are as great as their pizza! I plan on trying everything on their menu. Next will be the chicken fingers!"}
