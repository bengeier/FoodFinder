{"text":"Very good new restaurant. Staff is very polite and the seafood is fresh. Decent priced. Nice bar area. All around good spot."}
{"text":"My husband and I were excited to try this new restaurant near us.  We walked in at the same time as another couple and were seated first.  Our waiter took forever and ended up taking the other couples order but didnt get around to us for a while later.  He finally came around and took our drink order and took a long time to come bring them.  Meanwhile the other couple os enjoying their appetizer.  When the waiter finally brought our drinks we put in our order.  30 minutes later we nabbed him as he walked by and asked when our appetizer would be ready.  He said he would go check.  He went into the kitchen and then came back and said it was because the kitchen was so busy. The manager came to our table a few minutes later and tried to tell us that ours might take longer depending on tje preperation.  We told her that we didnt even get the appetizer yet which was a deep fried conch fritters that shouldnt take that long to prepare. She checked with the kitchen tjen came back to tell us that the waiter forgot to enter our order.  We told her we were going to pay for our drinks and leave.  She said that we wouldnt be charged for them but did nothing else to try to remedy the situation.  The waiter also spent a lot of time servicing the other couple and rarely checked on us during our wait. We werent sure if maybe he knew them or was catering to someone who were dressed up while we were wearing casual clothes thinking he would get a better tip.  Bottom line is they lie and the service is terrible.  I cant rate the food because we didnt eat but will be sure to tell all of our friends to skip this place."}
{"text":"South Charlotte, particularly the Ballantyne area, has few neighborhood, non-franchises to get excited about, well...this IS one. Serving up fresh fish daily on sandwiches, salads or in a combination with two sides in a casual environment that Jimmy Buffett would undoubtedly approve, this joint gets a lot of things right! Starting with the fresh fish (and ending with the house made desserts.) 

The 25 minute wait time that our excellent waiter, Aaron, informed us about in advance was worth it (well, amost). I went with the grilled grouper salad with ginger dressing. It was perfectly prepared. The only real shortcoming was that, at $17.95, the tomatoes should have at least been bought at a local farmer's market. They are just too plentiful in our area for that not to be the case. 

My wife went with these grilled pumpkin swordfish at $23.95 and two sides, the collard greens and mango salsa. The collards were a little spicy and the salsa was a little on the sweet side, but again, the fish was perfectly prepared.

We closed things out with an ample sized slice Michelle's Key Lime Pie for $5.95. It was very tart but pleasantly so. Overall, it was a good experience, the place had a 94.5 sanitary rating, the service was excellent and I'd say they're off to a good start."}
{"text":"This fantastic new restaurant has only been open for a few weeks, and I've already been back four times! The focus is on seafood with fresh fish flown in weekly. The menu features a \"Fresh Catch\" selection which changes weekly. The fresh catch can be ordered as part of a salad, or on a sandwich, or on a platter with two sides. There are also other items on the menu if seafood isn't your thing, or just not what you want today. Check out the Jerk Chicken!!! \"Raw Bar\" selections are available along with several starters and sides, and some very good desserts! 

From the starter menu, I've had the Conch Fritters and the Conch Chowder - both are excellent! As noted earlier, there are several  sides to choose from, but my favorite is the Caribbean Rice! From the fresh catch list, I've had the Mahi, Swordfish, and Halibut - all excellent! You can select your catch from the availability of the week and then have it prepared how you like it, including blackened, grilled, or fried. Most (if not all) desserts are made in-house, but do yourself a favor and try the bread pudding!  It is no doubt some of the very best bread pudding I've had anywhere!

They also have a full bar with a variety of beer, wine and other liquors.There is also a patio for outside dining.

Chef Earl and his wife Michelle have put a LOT into this new venture and I'm clearly impressed. It is not part of a franchise or a chain. The island \"vibe\" in the restaurant is very nice and service has been excellent! 

This gem is a little hard to find, but they are in the Fountains Shopping Center at the corner of Ardrey Kell Road and Tom Short Road. It is located back in a corner, by the fountain, with colorful umbrellas outside on the patio. KEEP LOOKING, it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"First time and will definitely be back. Great to have some variety in the area. We had Jerk Chicken, Mahi-mahi. Everything was excellent. Fresh, great seasoning, and authentic Jamaican fair. The Island Pickles are a must side. The baked bananas are also a good bet.  The service is just fine. If your in a rush this is not the best choice. The name \"Island Time\" should be your first clue. This is a place to have a relaxing time with friends - which we did."}
{"text":"The seafood here is so fresh. Nothing fancy just cooked perfectly. Reminds m of the seafood I used to get in Florida.  If you're looking for fresh no frills food this is the place."}
{"text":"We have been there twice. Each time wonderful  food, minimal to no wait, good service. Love love love ... swordfish bites, fried shrimp platter ... Big shrimp! And fish spread. We are hooked."}
{"text":"Finally. Great fresh seafood at reasonable prices. Have eaten here three times now... I smile after each visit... and no, I am not the owner, but a customer who moved from Boca Raton and has missed fresh seafood. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new restaurant in the neighborhood and we've been here for lunch or dinner probably 3 or 4 times now with our 2 yr old. Always such wonderful food and excellent service that it remains on the top of our list of places to eat out when we want to stay close. They're also super good with our son. It's not always easy to find places with a great atmosphere that are family friendly but these folks are genuinely nice and welcoming. I keep forgetting to take pictures of my food but I will next time because of course, we'll be back! Try the Island Style Bites and a Bimini Breeze!"}
