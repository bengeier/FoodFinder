{"text":"Pretty brutal place. Not sure where the positive reviews are coming from. My beef shawarma sandwich was awful. I saw someone mention how cold their sandwich was which was the same case for me. The meat was very gross did not taste good at all. It was cheap I will give it that but I would def not recommend. I guess my search for great shawarma in the annex continues..."}
{"text":"We popped in to grab a quick bite not really expecting much. In fact, the place doesn't look like much. A standard spot with tables and chairs. It's very unassuming. 

My friend wanted it hot, REALLY hot. The man behind the counter asked \"hot? or Canadian hot?\" When my friend told him to bring it on, he dug into the hot sauce and almost broke the spoon! My friend was sweating and said that it was just the right amount of heat. :D

I was not that brave, I went for the 'Canadian hot' and it was spicy enough for me. It was the best Chicken Shawarma outside of Montreal. (In my opinion) It was super cheap! My Swarma was $6! That's another reason that I wasn't really expecting much. 

**If you are looking for a quick, cheap & yummy bite to eat in the Annex, this is the place**"}
{"text":"I tried the beef shawarma and kebab, both very good. very soft and juicy. Their beef can taste a bit hard/dry sometimes, but other than that it was awesome! 

Nice little place to eat in a good area. Staff is very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"The poutine I ordered was 1 star. The service was 2 stars (I'm including cleanliness under this heading).

The french fries were soggy, the cheese was not cheese curds, and the gravy was just OK. If I've had poutine in 20 places between Ottawa and Toronto this was probably the worst.

Since people seem to like their shawarma's I would suggest they either remove the poutine from the menu, or invest time and money into improving their methods and ingredients.

Also, five out of eight of the empty tables had visible food scraps on them. I can forgive this when a restaurant is busy, but it was fairly quiet (only one table was occupied when I came in and there were two people working)."}
{"text":"I came in late to grab a chicken and beef shawarma. They didn't even use the chicken and beef from the spit. He used meat from a tray on the side. This explains why the chicken and beef was dry and not fresh. There was some kind of string in my shawarma as well. It was not good at all.
There are better options for shawarma on Bloor st."}
{"text":"This place is nice enough. Came through and had a falafel once, not expensive but not super cheap. Service and decor is average. Nothing to write home about"}
{"text":"I love the shawarma at Sarah's.  I'm partial to the beef, which is nicely marinated and just plain tasty.  What I especially love about Sarah's shawarma is the fact that they're served toasted.  After they wrap up the sandwich, they press it down on a toaster--not dissimilar to a panini grill--and results in a pita that's just nicely crusted and warm.

It's a rare day when I walk by the Annex and not stop at Sarah's.  I've never met the Sarah of Sarah's Shawarma.  But, I'm in love with her and I never ever cheat on her."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum!

Excellent food, Excellent Prices and Excellent Customer Service!

Wowza the guy behind the counter was multi-tasking like a pro.
The only draw-back was the tables weren't very clean, seeing as it looked like they only had 1 person working the entire restaurant, that was forgivable.

I got a falafel for 3.50$ which is an excellent price.  It was crunchy, tasty, dripping with garlic sauce and I even got extra pickled turnips (?) for no charge.   My friend got the cabbage-onion salad and although she was skeptical, she said she really, really enjoyed it.

I would definitely come back to this place and explore their other veggie delicacies!"}
{"text":"This would haVe been a solid 4 star, it was my favorite falafel joint because the flavor of the falafel balls was tremendous (though not as fluffy as Ghazelle) and the hot sauce was the best...they used a Harissa sauce in oil (which for some reason very few falafel places do which is a pity).  

However, a few months back the business changed owners and none of the original staff is there.  Quality and flavor has really suffered.  Their salads were never that great nor was there a good selection. That has  not changed.  Their hot sauce changed (for the worse) and the falafels and shawarmas are just ok.  May as well go to Ghazelle.  It's a shame, I loved this place for the past 10 yrs or so.

Still decent.. Nothing worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, the shawarmas are tasty and come in two sizes: regular and large. The price difference is just a few dollars, and the spiciness of them is great. Your mouth will be tingly and you'll need to buy a few drinks.

I think they also serve the dessert baklava here too, though I've never tried it."}
{"text":"dear sarah's,

your spicy beef kebab was delicious! you were like a little spicy party in my mouth! not only did you fill our bellies with your shawarma goodness, you were easy on the pocketbook as well! your workers were friendly and nice and your establishment was nice and clean! i couldn't have asked for more. :)

love,
dreamsrey"}
{"text":"Sarah's is reopened and still amazing!  Same owners/staff, same amazing falafel!  The interior has been completely redone, and looks great, with better seating and an ice cream machine!  It was a loooong wait (over a month, I think!) but WELCOME BACK, SARAH'S!!!  xoxoxo"}
{"text":"Sarah's is my go-to place in the Annex for a reliable, delicious shwarma.  I always order a large beef and falafel mix with tabole and fried cauliflower, and I always get what I'm looking for.  Their prices are reasonable for an above - average wrap, there's lots of seating and the workers are friendly.  Conveniently located on Bloor between Spadina and Bathurst."}
{"text":"A favourite spot amongst the U of T crowd, Sarah's offers a respectable selection of fine middle eastern favourites.

On the menu perched up at top of the wall (a la fast food style), you will find the ubiquitous chicken / beef shawarmas, falafels, hummus, baba ganoush and tabouli.  You will also find some less popular items such as dolmas.  

What sets Sarah's apart from the competition is their consistent delivery of quality ingredients.  You will never find a chunk of fat in middle of your shawarma sandwich.  It is always well seasoned, lean and nicely caramelized.  Even the veggie garnish that go into the pita sandwiches are well prepared; tasty beat pickles, fresh parsley and potent hot sauce.

Their vegetarian options are also worth mentioning.  Falafel balls are golden crunchy, hummus is top knotch and baba ganoush might be some of the best I  that have ever had; very smoky flavour and creamy texture.

The restaurant even scores high on the value department, since you can roll out of here under ten dollars (or maybe even under 5, depending on what your flava flavs are).

The low points: dingy atmosphere.. mysterious basement washroom that is not exemplary (par for the course in Annex?).. and near impossible street parking.  The Nazi enforc...errr.. I meant the Parking Enforcement are out on full force in this area all times of the day.

Going off topic slightly, I once received a parking violation ticket even though the parking stub dispenser was dead (I was informed by the kind officer that I should have crossed the street to get one).  So sneaky me, here is a tip for Yelpers:  Park down a block at the Kinko's .  Then walk into Kinko's rear entrance, and exit through the front entrance leading to Bloor.  That way if there is anyone watching, you appear to be a shopper.  :)"}
{"text":"Great Falafel sandwiches and large portions if you order plates (full meals). Minimal seating but great for late night snacking. TIP-ask for hot sauce/paste scooped from the bottom of well for an extra spicy kick."}
{"text":"My friend highly recommended this place and after reading reviews here, I went and got a chicken shawarma plate (~$12.50) and I guess my expectations were high because I was a bit disappointed as there wasn't anything special about it (the serving size is medium, you get rice and choice of 2 salads, hummus, and some meat). I went there again a few days ago just to give it another try and it was decent. So if you are nearby and hungry, it is good place to get your food but I won't go out of my way to get my dinner from here.

P.S. The sign by the entrance says that students get 10% with a valid student I.D, I didn't know about it, so if you go there make sure to ask for it."}
{"text":"The sign out front said 'fish wrap' and they didn't have it so I got falafel. She didn't make them fresh, they were hard, cold and dry. 
Maybe meat eaters have more luck here!"}
{"text":"\"I don't like falafel\" is a lie I used to tell myself.

It started many years ago, living at home with my family - my sister went on a middle-eastern kick and convinced our father to prepare some falafel for dinner from a store-bought boxed dry mix. It was bland and dry, so I came to the conclusion that the fault lay in the very idea of falafel.

This changed in my first year living in Toronto. I was out with some chums at a concert at the nearby Tranzac, and we wanted something to eat, fast and cheap. \"Sarah's!\" some fool emphatically suggested. I begrudgingly handed over my five bucks as the same fool went to make the food run for us all. The fool and his money were soon parted, in exchange for a falafel.

This thing changed me.

I could no longer keep telling myself the lie; \"I DO like falafel\" was all I could find when I accessed the place in my brain where I once kept it. (Then I would have a seizure from screwing around inside my brain too much.)

I've given Sarah's a five-star rating because I've never had a better falafel anywhere. I subsequently have categorized all falafel I've eaten into a three-tiered scale:
- Low-Quality Falafel (LQF), like that first instance, or the microwaved schlock they reheat for you at College Falafel.
- Medium-Quality Falafel (MQF), like those on the vegetarian plate at Cleopatra's (mmmmm), or from the unfortunately now-closed Syriandipity.

Of High Quality
Falafel, (HQF), there
Is only Sarah's

(I closed with a haiku there)"}
{"text":"Sarah's is the kind of little unassuming place that you might miss if you blink while walking down the street. It doesn't try to be anything that it's not, but that's what makes it so wonderful: it serves up Middle Eastern comfort food, bursting with flavour, and does it with perfection.

As a shawarma and falafel aficionado, I can't praise Sarah's Shawarma enough. With ample seating, great prices (they have a student discount if you bring your student ID with you,) and the flavorful food to back it up, this place is the real deal. My absolutely favourite to get is the Falafel Mix wrap, which comes oozing with garlic sauce, hot sauce (they have two flavours that the guy here always jokes about. Which one do you want, \"Canadian spicy\" or \"REAL spicy?\" haha, obviously go for the real spicy if you love spice, it adds a nice kick,) and deep fried veggies (hey, gotta get your nutrients for the day!)  You'll leave more than satisfied because the flavours here all all bold and unique, and because they make it fresh.

This place is, hands down, one of my favourite little hidden gems in the city, and I crave it at least once a week. Every city deserves a place like Sarah's Shawarma...my friends and I have been going here for years, and the quality hasn't changed one bit."}
{"text":"our favorite toronto falafel.  hands down.

get its spicy, and if you're super hungry get the falafel combo sandwich which comes with fried eggplant and cauliflower. the pickled turnip gives it a great crunch, the tahini a bit of tang, fresh tomato and lettuce crisps it up and the garlic sauce, hummus tops it all off. 

i won't lie, i have never had any of the shawarmas but i can only imagine they are just as amazing."}
{"text":"The falafel sandwich was really tasty. A little hot for me but still liked it. The pistachio baklava was the show stealer. It wasn't too sweet and had just the perfect crunch and freshness. One of the best ones I've had. Definitely worth a try.
The service was quick and pleasant late at night."}
{"text":"Been one of my fave shawarma spots for at least 10 years in the city. They just get it. Chicken Shawarma with extra turnip!!!"}
{"text":"Worst falafel I have ever had in my life.  Me and my friend were grossed out. I repeatedly asked if the falafel was hot and the server insisted it was.  When I got it.  It was cold.  There was no taste."}
{"text":"Sarah's used to be amazing , however I think they got new ownership. My beef kofta wrap was dry and lacked any sauce , the meat was super dry."}
{"text":"These are pretty danged good falafels!  The beets were a nice, unexpected addition to the filling.  (BTW, if you think Mystic Muffin makes good falafels - and I don't - you should try these ones.)

At 2 for 5 bucks on Bloor, how do they pay their rent?  Oh well, that will just have to remain a mystery.

The coleslaw was good too."}
{"text":"The beef shawarma wrap was really good. A tad bit pricey (~$10) for a large that didn't feel like a large when I was done and wanting more. Certainly one of the better shawarma wraps I've had for sure though."}
{"text":"Tried a falafel wrap here the other day and I can honestly say it was the worst falafel wrap I've ever eaten. Pretty disgusting and there are much better options in the area. The pita was dry and cardboard like, the vegetables were not fresh, there was too much tabouli giving it an overpowering parsley taste, the pickle had no crunch, the sauces were bland and the falafel balls are not made to order. Seriously disgusting waste of stomach space, very disappointed."}
{"text":"It might be the worst chicken shawarma that I have eaten, and I love chicken shawarma. First, it was dry, very dry. The whole thing was dry, including the actual chicken pieces. So the whole thing tasted like chewing paper. There were not much flavor either. I couldn't find the pickle or pickle flavor that was necessary to balance the saltiness from the meat and other stuff. I hope other items on the menu are better than their chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"Cheap for a regular chicken shawarma but the lady was stingy about the toppings. Even things like baba ghanoush were extra. .Also the chicken filling itself was bad. It was dry and kinda crumbled a bit and seemed to have no flavouring or marinade whatsoever which is essential to a shawarma. The pita was nice and the pickled beets were good too but otherwise not great. Would not recommend but if you're starving like I was, it's a decent place for a good price. $5.64 regular chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"Dismissive, rude service.  The first time I went and ordered two meals, it was buy one, get one half off and didn't realize untl I got home that they charged me full for both.  The food was nothing special. The next time I went in on the same day as the deal, they told me you have to mention it or they won't apply the deal.  Strange.  Food isn't good enough to warrant such a weird, first impression of customer service who seems like they don't like you while they serve you."}
{"text":"Although it wasn't the best shawarma wrap I've ever had, it was reasonably above average, and at that price point, one can't really complain. Quick service and the staff were quite pleasant. If you're in the Annex area and looking for some savory Middle Eastern food, don't hesitate to pay this place a visit!"}
{"text":"Good prices. Friendly staff, fast and efficient food. Liked how the ingredients were evenly distributed in the wrap. Bathrooms seem scary but there's an automatic sensor light for the stairs and bathroom, so the closer you get, the more light appears. Cash or debit only."}
{"text":"Went to here for some after bar food and because I had convinced myself that my friend Sarah would be inside (haha).  It was pretty busy as it seemed to be the only place still open.  Everything on the cooking side seemed to be in disarray and very messy.  Still, with hunger pains not subsiding, I opted to order the Falafel.  I would have liked more hummus and trimmings but everything seemed to be running out.  I thought the Falafel was good but it tasted like it might have been sitting out a bit too long.  Will have to go back at a time when all sauces are in stock and everything is fresh.  My friend LOVED her beef Shawarma  and is insisting we return - which I will happily."}
{"text":"I heard that this was the place to go for great Shawarma so I drove from the Airport to give it a try.  I was a bit disappointed with the beef shawarma as the meat was dry and hard.  To be fair I only tried this place once so maybe I got a bad batch.  The staff were friendly and greeted me with pleasant smiles.  The place is run down, dated and smelled of stale mop bucket water.  Over all i would say I would not drive out of my way to buy a Shawarma from Sarah's but may try again if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Sarah's used to be the best Shawarma in the city but I visited last week and the guy who was smoking a cigarette in the kitchen reluctantly came to put together my wrap and shoved together some dry chicken, coleslaw cabbage(not lettuce) and a couple other toppings(said they were out of tabouleh) into a stale wrap and drenched some generic hot sauce into it (they used to have their own homemade sauce but no longer.) No hummus. Disappointing fall of a once great place, will not return"}
{"text":"This place is the definite winner over Pitaland down the street. Extremely authentic shawarma. Friendly staff. I always opt for mine \"Canadian spicy\" - but they'll pack it on for the spice lovers in the crowd. The chicken is flavorful and the beef is incredible too. Extra pickled radishes and baba gannouj, and you're good to go!
I plan to return and try some of the other offerings in the case soon."}
{"text":"I actually am really not a fan of this place.  I don't get the hype- the meat and the falafels are not fresh and I find everything a bit dry and they compensate by bathing it in a lot of grease which just equates to overly dry meat coated with nasty oil.

every other place I see them cut the meat right off the spit and fry the falafels right in front of you when you order,

this place gets two big thumbs down from me.
I almost feel like I should say sorry for the bad review since so many people seem to be taken with sarah's"}
{"text":"Super yummy and friendly, funny staff. The vegetable samosa is better than the chicken."}
{"text":"These guys used to make my favorite chicken shawarma in the city, but the last few times I have been there quality has been horribly inconsistent, and there is a constant upsell. 
I could see if people were asking for bigger pitas, offer a bigger one and charge more, but these guys started using a much smaller pita and offering one a little larger than the regular one they used to offer. 
Of course the price did not go down when the sandwiches shrunk, and to top it off, I have not seen them carve fresh shawarma meat in such a long time, now it is all precut and in a warming tray, who knows how old the meat is?

Anyways, used to be a great place, but has gone downhill recently."}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way home from the city, was starving and this seemed like a good choice for a late night dinner.
Place is clean, friendly and the owner (I think it was the owner) seems to really value his clientele. I tried their Chicken Shawarma with the works. Didn't realize that the \"large\" sandwich was \"LARGE\". Filling and delicious and I'd recommend Sarah's (odd name) anytime if you're looking for a block of meat is kept heated on the rotating spit"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as it looks yummy from outside... however, my shawarma was rather disappointing. The chicken had a weird texture, it didn't taste fresh. Not sure if it was because I came later in the evening but even so, shawarmas shouldn't taste NOT fresh. I won't be a repeat customer. Plenty of other great shawarmas to be had, just not here."}
{"text":"For anyone who hasn't been to Sarah's in a while with their concerns about an alleged change in management, deterioration in food quality or any other negative developments, I would personally cast those doubts aside. After moving away from Toronto over a year ago, on my most recent trip back I was eager to return to Sarah's and can attest that in this year the shawarmas (yes plural) that I had were at least as good if not better. 

I ordered two large shawarmas, one beef and one mixed. The place was slammed at dinner time but even then my shawarma meat was carved fresh. Upon requesting extra garlic sauce, tahini and hot sauce, the man behind the counter proceeded to douse my sandwich with additional drizzles of sauce after each additional topping - extra turnips, extra parsley. After all this was done, my shawarmas were each enormous, overstuffed (American) footballs of flavor. I can't even begin to describe how profoundly messy and yet perfectly delicious this was. Your results may vary, as far as your sauce preferences go.

Again, considering this was my first time having Sarah's in nearly a year, I was completely blown away. (And yes, to anyone that reads my few other reviews, I review rarely and only places that I absolutely love.)"}
{"text":"This is one of the few places, maybe the only place, that I have eaten at back when visiting in September 2005 that is still around now that I live here.  The whole interior has changed and I wonder if it isn't under new ownership.

Last night I popped in for a quick bite before the Doc Soup screening--the first time in at least a year.  My favourite vege sandwich in the city may be their falafel sandwich with cauliflower and eggplant.  Scratch that.  This might be my favourite sandwich of any kind.

Usually I classify falafel into one of two groups: freshly made or already made.  Obviously freshly made always wins.  But last night I might have found the one exception.  (I'm assuming it was fried within the hour).  Paying a buck more for that eggplant and cauliflower was well worth it.

I won't pretend to be an expert here and just say that the other ingredients seemed fresh and were plentiful.  I got exactly what I wanted for under $6.

Compared to the older interior, the \"new\" Sarah's is vastly improved.  But keep in mind that this is a small budget shop in the Annex; there won't be a chandelier or cloth napkins.  

Excellent for lunch or a quick dinner, especially if you are en route to the Bloor.  And unlike the shop next to the theater, there is actually places to sit here.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best shawarma I've had outside the Middle East. They need to put fries in the shawarma, but that's my only grievance. Try the beef shawarma, it's not as popular but it definitely should be! The hummus and harissa (red hot sauce) is in my humble opinion, very authentic.

The staff is exceptionally kind, and the new renovations make it a place you actually want to sit down and eat -- you could bring colleagues here for lunch now whereas before it was more like that great little dive you get takeout from. 

Yay Sarah's, never change."}
{"text":"Eh, food is ok. You should opt for sushi or pizza instead, though, they're higher quality and volume of food is greater than this \"regular\" shawarma purchased here"}
{"text":"Sara's used to have the best falafel in TO in my opinion. And that's because I added baba ganouch to it. And Saras had the best baba ganouch on Earth. It used to have a smoky flavor to it. But their new recipe (haven't had one in about a decade or so) doesn't have the same smoky flavor. 

Their falafel is still excellent though."}
{"text":"Ordered my Beef Shawarma plate for my late night munch. I get a plate with what seems to be old meat that is dryer than my clothes fresh out dryer. I couldn't tell weather I was chewing meat or some sort of fabric. Well at least it's texture resembles 100% japanese cotton. Is that a good thing?

What happened to the plate? I left it on the table as is. I just walked 1minute to Big Fat Burrito for Food."}
{"text":"food was ok.
ordered 2 beef and 2 chicken shawarma + dozen flafel

shawarmas were ok not great however flafels were bad, hummus was also ok. My kids refused to eat flafel, they were not freshly made but were sitting in the bin for a while."}
{"text":"U of T finals weren't U of T finals without a 10pm break from All-Night Fung (am I dating myself?  I go dutch.) down to the Annex to go revive our souls and replenish our brain juices with a big, drippy schwarma.

Pita, savory hunks of little charred chicken bits, lettuce, tomatoes, hummus, pickled turnip, onions, and a drizzle of garlic sauce come standard.  Pay a little extra and throw on some amazing baba ganoush and tabouli.  Watch hungrily as they place the paper-wrapped bundle on the toaster for safe, warm keeping, pay with cash, and peel off the slightly crisped casing to reveal a savory, gooey, unconscionably tasty cylindrical meal. 

There's no shame in licking the paper."}
{"text":"It's sad, but Sarah's has really gone downhill.

They used to be a great option for a quick and tasty shawarma, with Tamarind Jumex being a nice bonus.

But the food has declined to the point where I'm not going back."}
{"text":"We were on a mission to get poutine, a must-do before leaving Canada. We had just about given up and decided to simply get Mediterranean food for lunch, but were pleasantly surprised to find that Sarah's Sharwerma offered the Canadian treat! So we ordered a large portion of poutine to accompany our chicken and falafel wraps, a meal for two totaling ~$20. I was slightly disappointed because they use cheese shreds instead of cheese curds which is the authentic style, but you still can't really go wrong with the combo of fries, gravy, and cheese, amiright? I was further reassured that it was an adequate representation of the Canadian dish when two students walked in and each had a large plate of poutine for themselves, seemingly as a square meal. The poutine was very salty and caused us to be thirsty for the rest of the day, so maybe the fries don't need to be salted considering the toppings are sodium-heavy. The wraps were good, though I couldn't really detect much falafel, only chicken. I wish they put more hummus in there, too. As tourists, we knew that coming to the UT campus would be a smart choice, with lots of ethnic foods at college student friendly prices."}
{"text":"i love strolling around this area, especially on a warm sunny afternoon.  nothing like stopping in here on a beautiful day for a falafel, right?  my shawarma/falafel knowledge isn't great, i just know they make an a-ok one here.

the decor is a bit lacking, but i think it suites the place.  although, my inner-germaphobe has his eyebrow slightly raised.

great prices for good food, but to be honeset, i can barely tell the difference between other shawarma/falafel places.  i'm ignorant, i know.  i think i need someone to show me where i can get an great authentic tasting shawarma."}
{"text":"I tried this place after the reviews, and I was like eh. i had better.

the meat was a salty, and there wasn't anything special.

I have been having Ali Baba near Dundas square, which imo is pretty good. in our trip to TO, shwarma was a great snack for us, and we really enjoyed them.

i like the other place instead of Sarah's for a few reasons:
1. Sarah's already has the meat cut up and is just stored on those containers. the meat is not grilled one more time upon ordering. AB place slices the meat and puts it in the grill one more time.
2. sarah's grills the schwarma inside the foil paper. i like to get my grill marks on my sandwich, and get it a bit crispier.

this is just imo. i m pretty sure there are other good places, but wasn't to impressed with Sarah. 
I didn't try Ghazelle, which is very close to Sarahs, but at least Ghazelle's smelled good from outside."}
{"text":"I'm revising my review to 2 stars. This place just isn't good anymore. The meat is really dry. they raised their prices. They're just coasting. At one time they had a really flavourful and spicy shawarma that was really distinctive. But that was years ago. Now it's just bland. too bad. I'de go to Laila in the neighbourhood if I was willing to wait 25 minutes to get a freakin' falafel."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the meat, but I will say the falafel is pretty fantastic. As is the hummus. I usually find falafel dry and pretty boring, but Sarah's makes them huge and tasty. Decent price. Quick. Nice people."}
{"text":"This place used to be good. I think they've changed ownership - their prices are now higher while their portioning is less. 

They ended up giving us two samosas for free, but they are $2.99 each if I had to pay for them - and having had the tiny, dry free ones - on top of what I ordered, I would definitely never order a samosa. Nor likely go back. Sometimes change isn't good."}
{"text":"Chicken liver.  Seriously.  I go to a Syrian shawarma/falafel joint to have what is probably Toronto's best chicken liver (probably Toronto's only chicken liver pita sandwich). 

I used to just go here for the falafel.  Occasionally wandered over to the veggie plate.  Tried the shawarma a couple of times.  enh.  And then one day they actually had the chicken liver, and I ordered it and it was perfect.  Tender, not hard, tasty with all of the regular pita sandwich toppings.

Whenever they have the chicken liver I order it.  When they don't have it, I'm very sad.

If the place was just a bit cleaner, I'd be going for the full five stars here."}
{"text":"Shawarma joints are a lot like convenience stores, they're scattered all over the city, they all offer the same goods and you generally know what you're going for before you even get there.  Sarah's however is a bit different.  

For starters, this is the one and only Syrian joint i've ever been to.  They're hot sauce is not Frank's nor is it Siracha, its Sarah's and its spectacular...full of flavour yet powerful enough to pack a wallop that will have you in tears in no time!  

This place has a hot table full of all sorts of great middle eastern foods but the staples (shawarmas and falafels) are what i go for.  While the shawarma here is the best you can find downtown...the falafel is what i really crave when i think of this place!  Like Josh said, the Falafel combo sandwhich comes with all the fixins (fried eggplant, potato and cauliflower + falafel)...together with their one of kind hot sauce, the fresh out of the frier falafels are to die for!!!  Finally, when you price these bad boys at 2 for $6...you cant help but keep coming back for more!  

By far, this is my favorate spot in the Annex!  Its definitely not the prettiest restaurant in the Annex...but you can feel the love that goes into the food in EVERY bite!  If you havent already been...take you taste buds for a treat n say hello to Sarah's for me!  

side note: For all you mussies...this place is as halal as they come!

As-Salmu `Alaykum (Peace be upon you)"}
{"text":"One of my co-workers likes to go here about once a week and he always gets the chicken shawarma wrap.  I always get the chicken shawarma plate (well once beef, but I switched back to chicken).  The plate comes with three salad sides, hummus, a pita, and hot sauce (optional).  It's a BIG meal and it's quite delicious and almost healthy (depending on which salads you get).  Sarah's also has a notably wide and eclectic mix of beverages despite it's size and I'm still not finished exploring the options.  The decor is cheap but still interesting.  The prices aren't particular cheap though.  My shawarma plate + drink is around $13, though that might be the most expensive thing on the menu and it's more food than most eat for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan. I've grown up eating shawarmas my whole life and this is the closest i find to the real thing in Toronto. They have a lot of good options, even i your vegetarian. They even have the pickled turnips which many shawarma places just seem to forget about or charge you extra for. 
Also have to appreciate their excellent assortment of different juices."}
{"text":"There's no shortage of places to get your falafel and shawarma fix along Bloor between Bathurst and Spadina. As any self-respecting U of T student will tell you, Sarah's falafels are among the best along this strip of Bloor. When compared to the broader spectrum of Toronto falafels, however, they're no more than average.

Falafel balls are okay considering they're not made fresh, quantity and variety of toppings is pretty good, and the hot sauce is tasty. The space is nice for a falafel joint and there's a good number of seats for eating in.

Overall a decent falafel if you're in the neighbourhood, but not worth going out of your way."}
{"text":"Went there for a falafel mixed veggie sandwich. 
1st for middle eastern food and or sandwich.. I don't really expect to pay $9  ( it's the large but it's not really large)
I went there for falafel.. and seriously I won't come back, they were really not good.. mushy, flavorless... not my idea of a great falafel place... nop..
won't come back ( I usually go at Mona's Shawarma & Falafel Fast Food Inc at 661 College St ( by grace street. I will stick to that place)"}
{"text":"Nice little place this is..

Came here for lunch a couple times. Got a chicken shawarma wrap, and a plate. And boy..that plate was huge. I just couldn't finish it all. Those ladies behind the counter just kept piling it on. They were very friendly and kind, and the service was instant. 

In terms of food, It was great. Chicken had nice juices, and was tender. The salads that you got to choose were flavorful as well. 

Moreover, I strongly recommend you come here for lunch. Get the plate if you especially have a big appetite."}
{"text":"Sarah wasn't there. I asked to see her, and the shop owner stared at me blankly. Misleading restaurant name. Nice flooring though."}
{"text":"Somewhere around 2.5 star. Falafel-afel-afel-afel-afel-awful!!!!!!!!!! 

(There used to be a crazy lady on the streets who used to mutter that in the Annex, honest. Maybe she really was referring to Sarah's) Just kidding. Their falafel is actually ok but nothing special.

Anyway, my bitching and moaning about this place is that it keeps getting more and more expensive. WTF? Some of the plates are $10.99 plus tax and the portions are NOT big. Considering this is a cheap-o takeaway place, nothing on the menu should be $10.99. 

I like the food way better at both Ghazale and Laila down the street. At Ghazale I can get a combo platter for $6.99, the food is tastier and the portion is at least double in size.

I used to live directly 2 floors above Sarah's for about 2 years. We had mice infestation x 1000000, so I worry about the cleanliness at Sarah's, although I've never actually spotted any mouse turds inside the place."}

Sarah's is one of those places I'd been waiting to go for the longest time after hearing so many people say it's the best shawarma in the city.
So the verdict is that the shwarma is alright! I'm not sure how to rate or describe a shawarma but I can tell you Sarah's does not come close to the good stuff you can get anywhere in Germany, France or NYC! 
That being said, there are a good couple of positive notes to take away:
-Hours are great
-Staff is extra nice
-Space is brand new and clean
-Meat is not extra spiced as in some places

Overall, probably the best place to grab shawarma late at night in Toronto."}
{"text":"I generally hate the restaurants on this strip of Bloor-- bad sushi, pub grub, truly mediocre cafes, greasy noodle houses passing off chow mein as pad thai, etc.  Sarah's though can be trusted for a good falafel.  I like the hot sauce they use, and I like that they put the falafel in a panini press.  My one complaint is that they wrap falafels in tissue paper, which after pressing sticks to the falafel; paper is not technically food."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular, in my opinion.. Yes, it was a good shawarma, but I feel like there are plenty of other places with 'good enough shawarma'. 

The space is pretty..weird, I would say. It's a cheap-looking place, with mismatched decor and frames with different currency bills in them. I don't know what they are trying to say with that - they like money? 

I also got a pistachio baklava, as I usually go cray-cray over them, but when I got home I discovered it was burnt on the bottom, and that changed the whole taste of it :("}
{"text":"One of my favourite Falafel spots in Toronto.  The Falafel Combo sandwich is not to be missed (fried eggplant, cauliflower + falafel).

Usually its pretty clean and there is lots of seating.  The ingredients are fresh and they offer both whole wheat and white pita as a choice.

Pricing is reasonable and they have a good drink selection.  Definitely my choice out of a number of middle-eastern take out spots along the strip between Bathurst and Spadina on Bloor."}
{"text":"To be honest, ive had better shawarmas in the city. This one, not enough sauce, chicken wasnt that tasty and vegetables were too raw."}
{"text":"Dirty and Delicious.

So this isn't the nicest or cleanest of places, but in my opinion, you really can't ask for much from a shawarma place.  And once and for all, is this the correct spelling?  Gotta love multiculturalism in Toronto and their freedom of interpretation.  I digress.

The best thing about this place is that the meat is always tasty and tender, and they are generous with their portions.  I've found that at a lot of other places I've tried, the meat just is way to dried up and the wrap is just more pita than anything else.

My suggestion: get the chicken/beef combo.  You won't regret spending that extra dollar or two."}
