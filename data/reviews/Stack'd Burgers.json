{"text":"It's pretty good for the burgers. The fries though weren't good. Seemed like they were frozen. 

The have a nice bar area. And even an outdoor area. Once the weather is better that will be great!"}
{"text":"I went with my family here last night. We are burger people so we were pretty excited to try a new place. As we walked in we noticed how nice it looked from their remodel. We used Nowait so we didn't have to wait at all when walking in. We sat at a nice large booth and it was  quite comfortable. We ordered 2 beers, 2 mixed drinks and 2 waters. We got the beers, mixed drinks with the wrong liquor and no waters. We then waited for the waitress to come back to let her know we had the wrong drinks and no water. She brought back the correct mixed drinks and apologized but still no water. We then all ordered make your own burgers. I will say they did have a nice selections of toppings. There was one thing on the sheet we noticed so we asked the waitress about it. We are big burger people and with that being said we enjoy our burgers juicy and cooked medium rare- medium. The waitress told us that they only make their burgers medium well to well done. We were then pretty disappointed because it never tastes as good over cooked. Well we were right, the burgers were nothing special at all. One person even said they would rather have a McDonald's burger then what they had. The fries were good ( curly and Cajun). To me the whole thin burgers all cooked the same and stacked it just lazy. Everyone wants a big juicy burger cooked to their liking. 

With that being said, the burger competition is quite large in the Pittsburgh area and we will more than likely not go back here. If we do it would be for the beer selection and chicken or apps. 

I will likely drive 10 mins away to either Burgatory or BRGR. They have much better burgers and you can get it cooked how you like it."}
{"text":"WHERE IS THE JUMBO PRETZEL???? My favorite menu item is now gone. I often would come just for beer and a JUMBO PRETZEL.  The new pretzel  twist is not good.  I can go elsewhere for beer now.   Still love the wings, don't change them!  5 stars if you bring the JUMBO PRETZEL back."}
{"text":"The beer selection and food was okay - not great, but the 2 star review is because of the attitude that a guy who was either an owner or a manager (I think) gave me when I requested my burger be cooked medium rare (my usual way). When a place has signs on the wall saying that they make custom burgers, that usually means you can select how pink it will be, and he overheard me asking the waitress about it.  His response shocked me.  He said that that they only cook their burgers medium-well or well and \"if I didn't like it he would comp my meal and I didn't have to come back.\" The waitress suggested that I order chicken instead!  I went to a burger place to get a burger, so I decided to stick with the burger - what neither of them told me was that their patties are 1/4 lb and therefore too thin to cook and keep pink in center.  The burger was pretty juicy and not over cooked.   BRGR is a great burger place just a few miles north and Burgatory is great and just a few miles south of Stack'd.  Based on this experience, I'll go back to one of those places and steer clear of this one."}
{"text":"The service and food were very good.  However, my wife and I went to Stack'd on Friday after work.  They advertise on their website for having happy hour until 6:30 and half off apps.  We ordered several apps thinking they would be half off.....WRONG!!!  When I got the bill they were charged full price, when I asked the server about the price she advised that happy hour only applies if you sit at the bar.  This was never mentioned or stated on the menu or website.  It is very misleading and wont be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We stopped into Stack'd for dinner Saturday night, and we were so impressed.  Saturday nights are always burger nights for us, and we are always questing for the perfect burger.  Stack'd does not disappoint.  Thanks to NoWait, we had only a few minutes before we were seated, and the service we received from the start of our meal to the end was exceptional.  Chelsea was our server, and she was friendly, professional, and anticipated everything we would need before we needed it.  Our drinks were always refilled, and we were so impressed by her outstanding service, especially since she was also serving a huge party that was celebrating a teenage birthday.  The burgers were delicious, the toppings were fresh, and the fries are great.  I had the regular fries, and husband had the curly fries -- both are excellent.  Oh, and the side salads are way better than you would expect at a burger place.  They are fresh, filled with good greens, tomato, and cucumber, and topped with cheddar and croutons -- so worth it!  Thanks to Chelsea's great service and the great food, we had a perfect burger night at Stack'd."}
{"text":"Great burgers!  And they have tater tots! I ove tater tots and so nice to have a choice other than french fries. The beer selections offered a nice variety and not the same old selections.  We will be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"A solid meh. Their hamburgers are reheated frozen patties, and I don't even know how this is possible, but my well done burger had several tiny pink bits in it. It was very loud. I don't see what the big deal is here. This place is average, nothing more."}
{"text":"This location recently opened near us so we decided to check it out.

Atmosphere:
The bathrooms are clean. Hey, don't laugh. This is important. :-)
The music is quite loud. It was difficult to carry on a conversation even when sitting right next to someone else. I believe our conversation went something like...
\"blah blah blah
WHAT?
blah blah
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?
There were two fireplaces in the bar area. This was a nice addition, especially during the winter. The seats near the fireplaces were hard and saggy. If I had not known that this establishment was new, I would have thought that the furniture was long overdue to be replaced. I even switched my first chair for another thinking that mine was defective!

Shake:
We had a chocolate shake. The chocolate was acceptable, but nothing special. The was no depth of flavor or richness to the chocolate to distinguish it from any ordinary, generic shake. While the shake was not runny, neither was it particularly thick. There were chips of ice in the shake. The whipped cream had that greasy plastic mouth feel to it indicative of whipped cream designed to hold its shape and look nice rather than to taste good.

Onion rings:
The onion rings were crisp and not greasy. Perhaps this is normal or perhaps it was a result of being overdone/burnt/dark brown tinged with black. The onions were thin and completely overpowered by the bland breading.

Drinks:
My water \"with no ice\" had frozen water floating in it. Our server was very good at keeping our drinks filled though.

Burger:
The burger was extremely well done. To be fair, the menu does warn that the burgers come well cooked. They aren't kidding. They take the definition of well done and stretch it to the farthest limits. The burgers are also so over salted that one bite had me reaching for my water. I tasted the burger without the bun or condiments to verify this. 

The half pound burger comes as two (presumably) quarter pound burgers stacked on top of each other. This is a bit odd. Is it really that hard to make one big burger instead of two little ones? This gives the impression that the burgers are not fresh and are formed into little patties ahead of time. 

The bun had a slight crunch to it which might have been a result of toasting.. or might not. There was no other evidence of toasting. No slight browning of the edges, no nuttiness of flavor, no evidence of a Maillard reaction at all.

The field greens were fresh and plentiful.

The few scattered bits of mushroom were sliced thinly and diced into small chunks. They added no flavor and no texture to the burger, a sad state of affairs for something that calls itself \"Shroomin\".

I asked for the garlic aioli \"on the side\". It came on one side of the burger and not the other. I suppose, that is technically correct from one point of view. I had intended it to be on the side of the plate and not on my burger, however. Fortunately, there was only a little bit of aioli so it wasn't overly noticeable. I tasted the aioli. As far as I can tell, it just tasted like mayo. I cannot speak to the quality of the aioli/mayo since I don't actually like mayo. 

Ketchup:
Its Heinz. 

One other thing to note: If you build your own burger with exactly the same ingredients as ordering the shroomin burger, you will pay several dollars more. Yes, for exactly the same thing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were excited to try this place out. It was just a total let down. We loved the options on the menu, but the food just wasn't great. One of my toppings was \"grilled peppers\"-which were thick rings of green pepper that weren't the least bit grilled. I couldn't really taste the short rib add-on. My sweet potato fries were cold. The service was ok, but there were 4 employees loitering at the host stand near our table. Another guest shouted out vulgarities near the bar, in addition to the music selection of Shaggy singing about being buck naked on the floor. For a 2:00 lunch it wasn't family friendly for us and our 5 year old. Too many misses for us, we have way better options and won't be back."}
{"text":"Great burgers with yummy milkshakes. 
Kids meals come on a cute frisbee you can take home after the meal.  We had a large group and our server did a great job!"}
{"text":"First time at Stack'd and was not impressed. We were not greeted coming in or leaving. Which may have been due to the fact that they were somewhat busy. Not in the weeds, somewhat busy. It still doesn't excuse the lack of a simple hi. 

Our food took forever but Our server was good. However, she did charge us for something we didn't order. It was only .50, but we still shouldn't have been charged.

The food was ok. I ordered wings. Half buffalo parm and half jerk rub. The buffalo parm was literally medium wings with grated Parmesan thrown on the plate, which covered some wings and was barely on others. Same with the rub. One wing was buried in the rub, another wing had zero rub on it. Miserable presentation. I've worked in restaurants and between the fry cook, expo, food runner, and server, the food presentation should have been better. 

The only reason that I gave them 3 stars instead of 2, was the beer selection was good and my kids enjoyed their meal. Good day."}
{"text":"Good burger, good prices--but not a place that I would go out-of-my-way for--that place is still my all-time fave, Tessaro's in Bloomfield!  I loved the cauliflower wings, though--they were great!"}
{"text":"I love this place already! This was my first time here, and I was hoping to see good options on the make your own burger menu... I did! So I chose Cajun turkey with guacamole, olives, mushrooms and A1 steak sauce. 

The burger was fantastic! The sweet potato fries were also really good. I will be coming more often :)"}
{"text":"The feel of the restaurant and bar is great. Very open and inviting. Great selection of beers and friendly wait staff and front of house.  The menu looks good and we were optimistic about a new casual restaurant and potential happy hour spot but then we got our food.  All dishes were below average.  I'm guessing canned, pre-packaged everything.  I don't think there was one item freshly made.  If they improve the quality of food it could be a gold mine.  Too many other options with better food."}
{"text":"First time I tried the place and it was pretty good. 
I really enjoyed the beef in my burger and it was prepared just right. The bun was good and the bacon was pretty lean, (a pet peeve of mine) and out waitress took good care of us. I had a side a slaw instead of fries on Doctors orders, and the slaw was good with an unusual apple cider taste to it. Different but good. 

When you order, you can build your own ala Burgatory, where you check the boxes and pick out exactly what you want. My only beef, (pun intended) is that the mustard and house sauce was good but there wasn't really enough of it to hardly taste it. I should have asked for more house sauce. Maybe next time. I will try this place again because it was pretty darn good but not great. For $12 I was hoping to leave a little more excited.  I will try it again and order a little differently next time around. Over all good fast service and fresh beef, I'll be back to try it again."}
{"text":"We stopped by today for lunch around 1:30. The place wasn't too busy, which was nice considering it was mother's day. The atmosphere was bright and lively and the staff seemed polite and courteous. Our server was okay, she was nice and polite but we didn't get much of a welcome or were not told her name. 

The menu concept, as some have mentioned, is similar to Burgatory or BRGR. The food...meh. I honestly was expecting more from a place whose first page of there menu is boasting about the naturally raised, antibiotic free and hormone free meat they use. I think I could have gotten a better tasting burger at Wendy's. The fact that we could only get our burgers done to medium well was disappointing and was the first factor in the poor tasting burger. Secondly, the flavor was lacking due to the use of ZERO seasoning on our burgers. I did not see any mention of seasoning used on burgers but in the era of youtube videos, blogs and food channels, one would think that it is safe to assume that folks know to use seasoning if they would like a good tasting meal. Also, our food was luke-warm at best and my curly fries...cold! I wonder if someone drove down to Arby's to pick up my order of fries and then they sat in the window for 20 minutes while they cooked the flavor out or my burger? The fries were a disappointment because again, a place that brags about the beef they've so carefully selected certainly must care about all of the food they prepare. Obviously not the case because these looked like the same fries one would get at Arby's. And yes because we were all so hungry we still ate our food. Try telling a two year old that he has to wait longer for his meal and see what happens? 

Will we be back, honestly no. I think there are better places in the city that stand up to the standards of the food  that they claim to serve. If you're okay with serving cold, tasteless, mediocre food, then are you really that careful to serve sustainably raised, hormone free ingredients? 

Also, for the love of all things culinary...use some salt!"}
{"text":"We were thrilled when a stack'd opened right nearby: we are regulars at the one in Oakland in Pittsburgh. That one is excellent.

The restaurant is nice and everything is perfectly ok. However, on the several occasions we've been here, the food was always \"ok\", as opposed to delicious and perfectly spot-hitting in Oakland.

If that were it it would be fine, but the prices for everything - the exact same items - are just higher at the Wexford restaurant. 

Just go to Oakland."}
{"text":"Recommended by a good friend who knew I was a burger lover!! She was on point!  I was extremely impressed.  Super cute bold - yellow lettering reads the sign \"Stack'd Burgers\" on the outside of the establishment.  Located on the end plaza \"Pine Tree Shoppes\" (where Bonnie and Clyde's used to be).    Spacious - hip and modern.     Nice selection of Craft Beers and fun menu. If you don't want to build your burger there's plenty other variations to choose from.    I of course had to build my own burger and was very satisfied (wheat bun, double stack, blue cheese, bacon, onion rings)     It's a similar concept to Burgatory but I noticed there seems to be more options available.   You  may notice several i-pads up at the hostess stand.. they are for the children to use !!  How nice !    It was great first visit to Stack'd and look forward to returning again.  Thanks Stack'd!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Burgers are thin 1/4 pounders stacked, and way over done . Manager told me that that is necessary for the efficiency of serving various types of burger combinations. Sounded a lot like the theory behind McDonald's, although truthfully McDonald's is better. There are too many good gourmet burger places around to ever go here again. The appetizers, drinks, and salads were quite adequate. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with a couple who was there before.  Nice atmosphere.  Greeter put us at a table that had limited view of the Tv's, on a hockey night no less,  so we got a different table.  Server or the kitchen got a lot wrong.  Wife ordered chicken quesadilla,  got chicken sandwich: sent it back. Then they forgot the fries. I ordered side salad with Caesar dressing,  got a Caesar salad, no big deal.  Checks came and other couples drinks were on our check and vice versa.  Food was fine.  My burger a bit over cooked but good."}
{"text":"This was my first time at stacked and it's fairly new in the area. They really changed the interior from the previous restaurant and I liked it!  It was easy to talk to my coworkers at our lunch and, even tho we appeared to be the in enclosed-outdoor section, the area was really warm. 

The waitress/bartender was very attentive and knowledgeable and willing to help with the menu. The menu was very similar to something you'd find at Burgatory, where you can build your own burger or choose off a list of house burgers. I can't believe another burger place would pop up in this area, but it did!

The had a great \"fry\" option and our group had a mix of old bay, Cajun, curly, and tater tot fry testers. Everyone seemed happen with their choices over all. 

One suggestion is that you make sure you know what size burger you are getting if you are not creating your own. My burger happened to be off the ehh and was 1/2 lb (I wasn't asked which size I wanted) and it was really just too much for me. 

I can't wait to go back and try another concoction!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, fantastic food, fantastic atmosphere. would DEFINITELY pick this place over any burger bar in the area. 10/10."}
{"text":"Stopped in on my way home from work for lunch. Had a fantastic Bacon Cheeseburger Casadilla. It really hit the spot! Staff was friendly and the restaurant is has a great look  an inviting atmosphere. I'll definitely stop by after work again very soon."}
{"text":"I went on Saturday with the parents. We all really enjoyed the food. The floor plan is very open and inviting. Our server was very nice. The custom burgers is a fad, but it seems the prices at Stack'd are much more reasonable. Although I do not drink, I noticed the beers were mostly $6-8.

I had the veggie burger with grilled mushrooms and onions. It was very good and made from scratch. My mom had the fried chicken burger, while my dad had the wings. We all got the curly fries, which were perfectly crisp. The meal was very enjoyable, and we cannot wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I've been to Stack'd many times as I work right down the street and live two blocks from the one in Shadyside. Food is usually pretty good with quick service. Today I came for lunch and ordered my burger with a lettuce wrap, and there was a dead fly on the lettuce leaf in plain sight. I asked the server if they washed their lettuce?? He said, \"yes, we have a machine, sorry about that\"...and walked away!!! Absolutely no suggestion, offer to replace, nothing. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"This was my first visit which included a painting event. The service was good overall. We were able to get the last table open outside. Eating out in the patio was great as it wasn't super hot outside. I enjoyed the appetizers I had which were flatbread pizza and mahi tacos. I had an easy time speaking and hearing my friend as this place was not overly loud considering the huge number of customers. I would be happy to visit again and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few burger places in my day, but this by far is my favorite in terms of the burgers themselves. You can build your own burger -a lot of great options for toppings and sauces. They provide a paper for you to build your own burger by checking off what you want--great place to go if you lose your voice, you can still order! The old bay fries were delicious. I went with a large group for lunch and they were able to seat all of us right away and everyone enjoyed their meal. The restaurant itself wasn't loud, definitely a plus for a big group."}
{"text":"The salmon burger was very flavorful and was cooked perfectly but the sweet potato fries were a little overcooked. Our dinner group of seven were there tonight during the busy dinner time but we were taken aback on our fast our food came out! We all thought it was nice that our waitress came to tell us happy hour was almost over if we wanted to order more drinks. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"First time here and I would not recommend this restaurant. They are a burger restaurant, but the burgers are terrible. They told me they only cook the burgers one way which was medium well........you're a burger place and can only cook the burgers one way? Makes no sense to me. Anyways, the burger came out and was extremely dry and the bun was burnt. Such a shame cause the restaurant is beautiful. Not going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I agree that Stack'd is mediocre at best and our first visit was likely also our last.  Maybe it depends on who is in the kitchen or what you order, but there was nothing about our food to make us think this place is anywhere as good as the other burger joints in the area.  If I am paying restaurant prices, I expect to get something at least a little better than what I could make myself.  But with this place, I felt we could have gotten the same items at the grocery store and made the same meal for a lot less.  The pretzel appetizer semed like it was a boxed frozen one.  I ordered a sesame bun for my burger and got a plain bun that seemed not quite but almost at the point of being stale.  The bacon on my burger was undercooked. (The fattier parts were still white and rubbery rather than browned and crisp.)  The only things that seemed freshly made and not out of a package were the burger patties.  Which by the way, they supposedly only cook to medium well because they are \"too busy\" to cook to well done, but apparently they \"made an exception\" because I asked for well done.  I have never in my life been anywhere else that makes cooking meat to well done seem like such a problematic request.  My husband got the bison and was also not impressed and has had better.  Maybe other places just do a better job of \"doctoring\" pre-packaged items, or maybe the other places we frequent actually do have more freshly made items.  Either way we will stick with Harmony Inn, North Country Brewing Co., or even BRGR when we want burgers.  The manager did come to our table to address our diassatisfaction, which was appreciated but still not enough for us to go back.  I expect this place will be gone in a year or so like the other restaurants that were previously in this same location."}
{"text":"Drove by and saw it was open so we decided to try it. I'll start with the positives.

They did a nice job renovating the space. It looks nice and they have a nice bar area. They also have 32 different beers on tap (some craft beer). 

I like how you can choose what type of meat, your bun and condiments. That's always fun. I loved my pretzel bun, pesto aioli and bacon. The tater tots also were good and not too salty like they are at most places.

The server was kind, professional and attentive in filling our drinks, which was great.

Unfortunately, my family and I thought the burger was just ok. With a completely saturated burger market in Pittsburgh you better be excellent and have something different. Again that was not the case there. You can get all the same things at other better burger places and their burgers are much better. 

It's a shame we wanted to like it, but were not impressed."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time last weekend and we were pleased with food and service. It's a Burgatory but better."}
{"text":"This was my 1st stop of the day. $7.50 for a gourmet burger accompanied by tasty fries helped begin my day of adventure. I had outside seating plus a waitress that performed at a top level. One thing, not good nor bad, that is different from Harrisburg is that this is in a small shopping center. So I recommend you put it in perspective. Wouldn't it be much cooler to stop here for lunch and a drink rather then a run of the mill franchise like Olive Garden?"}
{"text":"Wow I had a horrible day smashed my car into a bridge during a blizzard and still made it for the soft opening. Stacked had amazing service. Jenni the bartender was awesome. She was very nice and I completely forgot about sliding my car into that bridge. Jenni made my day so much better. Everyone tip her well if you sit at the bar. 5 stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Stack'd in Wexford last night, a Wednesday, about 7. Been here a couple of times before and thought their burgers had great flavor. 

Not very crowded this time. We sat in the bar area near the fireplace, which is a nice touch. It was quite dark and a little difficult to see the menu. We ordered soft drinks, and after they arrived, placed our burger orders via the customized burger checklist, like Burgatory, but without the option of doneness. Our orders arrived within a reasonable time, but via a service person instead of our waitress. We never received a setup, i.e., knife, fork, napkin, and that had been two different employees to our table that should have noticed. I took a bite of the burger and had grease dripping down my wrist, but no napkin. After finally flagging down the waitress, we were able to get napkins, but still no utensils. Isn't this standard food service protocol? For the sauce on my burger I chose Thai chili, and I was pretty sure they just forgot it, until I reached the second half of the burger. Uneven coverage if you ask me, leaving the first half pretty dry. But, again, I give this place lots of credit - these burgers have really great flavor.

If not for the service and sauce issues, this would have been a 5 star."}
{"text":"Just got back from happy hour.  Ordered the Mahi Tacos and a few beers.  The beers were good, the Tacos came out ice cold.  The fish itself had ice on it.  We told the waitress who took them back, and never returned to ask us how we were doing or if we needed anything while we waited.  Three of us ordered the tacos, one ordered a sandwich.  Now we are eating out of sync.  The tacos came back, but I could hardly eat them from the memory of biting into ice cold fish.  Ick.  Will probably never return.  Unfortunately this place is in our neighborhood with a cool vibe.  I would like to like it.  But where was the manager?  Where was the \"hey, have a beer on the house while you wait\".  Anything.  But no, just...here are your now lukewarm fish tacos.  Not sure I will ever be able to eat a fish taco again."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night and had a great experience! The atmosphere is very warm and inviting, and we used the Nowait app to get in which helped a lot! 

Our waitress Morgan was extremely friendly. We opted for nachos as an appetizer with the pulled pork. The pork had a nice sweetness to it and the chili and jalapeños definitely had a kick to it. 

I ordered the California chicken sandwich which came with pesto aioli, bacon, cheese, and field greens. Chicken was cooked perfectly, it was great. I know I came to a burger place and ordered chicken but I'm not a huge burger fan (I know I know) and it was honestly delicious! Got their onion rings on the side which were awesome. 

My husband opted for a burger and said it was delicious, but also didn't love that he could not pick the meat temperature. I get why they do this, he's just more of a rare meat kinda guy. Got sweet potato fries on the side which were also delicious. 

Annnd, as if we did not eat enough we both got milkshakes. Peanut butter chocolate and the Oreo. Both were delicious. 

Overall had a great meal, will definitely be back to try more...maybe even a burger next time!"}
{"text":"I got takeout on a Thursday afternoon from Stackd.  It was very busy in the restaurant as it was an off time, around 145pm.  Overall I was very satisfied with the host and most of the food. My build your on burger was delicious and I would get it again in a heartbeat however i was very disappointed with the fries.  I ordered the Cajun French fry basket and started to eat them as soon as i got into the car.They were served in a large takeout container however it looked more like a side than a basket. The size was not the main issue though, I wouldn't have any complaints if they tasted good.  They were extremely overcooked or they sat under a warmer and they were the bottom of the fry bin. Overall a great experience and I will be back however the French leave much to be desired and I will avoid them next time."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! Amber went out of her way to supply my husband with every type of hot sauce they had. Husband said the bison burger was better than any beef burger he had ever eaten. My grandson loved that he got to play with a tablet. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very fresh burgers, great service and good beer selection make this a favorite.  We always customize our burgers and have had the fries, tots, and onion rings.  I don't know about the other food on the menu, but the burgers are great.  The milkshakes are very good too."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. The atmosphere of the place is great. It just felt very welcoming. I especially loved their fireplace near the bar. Laid back spot to grab some food with your friends and family. I wish I caught our servers name because she was very friendly. We were the only ones in there as we arrived not long after opening. I don't think it would be fair to comment on wait times. They have a build your own burger menu that had a wide variety of options. You can also build other items like a crispy or grilled chicken patty, salmon, turkey burger, veggie burger etc. I noticed they offer a bison burger as well. The prices vary. You get four toppings free which was plenty for my husband. I know if I would get one and put more than that it would be a pain to eat the thing anyways. Curious if anyone has tried the peanut butter on their burger though lol. Nice variety of sides like various fries, fruit, salad, coleslaw etc. I love having a good amount of options even though I can never make up my mind. That was exactly the case when I was trying to decide whether to get wings or a burger. Their wings look great and they offer so many different sauces as well. If you're into cauliflower florets you can get those instead of wings which I found intriguing. Ultimately I got the veggie quesadilla and it was really good. Yes I am the girl who ordered a quesadilla at the burger joint. The tortilla has a pleasant herb taste to it and was nice and crisp. Comes with pico and sour cream woo! I added the guacamole as well. It was basic guac but nice to have something to dip. It's also nice that the menu has so many other items on it. It's not strictly burgers and wings. I noticed they offer a pretty wide variety of beers as well. I do not drink so I can't comment on the bar side of things. Oh and if you're a milk shake fan they sound delicious! Overall a nice experience and better than we expected."}
{"text":"We REALLY enjoyed this place. We saw it on yelp with good ratings and even better looking pictures and locals recommended it as well. The outside is appealing and draws you in with the cool sign and lots of windows. It is a spacious location with good separation of areas and lots of seating. It was fairly busy on a Saturday night but didn't need to wait to be seated which was nice. 
Our waitress was very very attentive and checked back in with us often. She was helpful in giving opinions and was friendly about making changes to menu items. The menu itself is very diverse for a burger place and the salads looked awesome! We went with fruit salad as a side because we are trying to be healthy which was the best fruit salad we have ever had at a restaurant, no regret there...fresh and plentiful fruit selection. Burgers and toppings were tasty, regular burger was better than turkey as turkey was a little salty. FYI burgers are thin patties and not cooked to temp or preference. 
We would definitely go back again if in the area. Also....ordering a burger off the menu and substituting items was found to be far cheaper since they came with a side vs. the build your own option. P.s. they had like 100 tablets for kids to play on while they waited for their food which was a unique and fun touch!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with some co-workers for a little Christmas get together. Place is cool inside very spacious and cozy. We managed to grab a few beers at Happy Hour which the selection of craft beer was impressive and the cost was top notch. A bunch of appetizers were ordered up and the pierogies and nacho's really hit the spot with me. To top it off I ordered some wings which were also good. 

I can't really fault the place I thought it was a nice establishment with good customer service. I will return again one night for a few beers and app's this is good choice in the area.

4 out of 5 all day long."}
{"text":"Super family friendly. Kids are allowed to use tablet computers preloaded with kid-friendly games. The menu consists of burgers, salads, appetizers, sandwiches, etc. Very similar in feel to Burgatory if you're familiar, but also does a good job at standing alone with some more unique offerings. You can build your own burger and there are some very fun and unique toppings available for use in your custom creation. The salads here are really delicious and generously portions as well and the fish tacos on the appetizer menu are also super good...far too often I find places with flavorless fish tacos! That is not the case here."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. My wife and her friend and I ate outside on the deck on a sunny Sunday afternoon. Unfortunately the music heard throughout the entire restaurant was 90s grunge alternative music - definitely not a family friendly atmosphere or even warm and inviting. The wait staff were nice and helpful.

I had fried pickles, side salad, sweet potato fries, and Barnyard burger with no bun. The fried pickles were good and the salad and fries were average. The Barnyard burger no bun was not good at all. The burger patty was thin, very greasy, not very flavorful, and well done. It tasted like a premade, frozen patty from your local grocer. The waiter did not ask how we wanted our burgers cooked because medium well and well done are the only options due to how the burgers are cooked he said. The egg was way over done and the sauce used on the burger was not good at all as it tasted like very bland mayonaise. My wife and her friend agreed their burgers tasted like fast food. We will not be dining here again especially since they dropped the ball as being a burger joint. I would recommend the well known reliable burger joint in McCandless Crossing (starts with 'Burg' and ends in \"tory\") over this place."}
{"text":"While in town/at home taking care of some business I met one of my BFF's here after getting our nails done. 

We were seated immediately (mid-day on a Wednesday so no surprise here) in the bar section. The table to be honest could have been cleaner. It has one of those surfaces that need extra attention so well...FYI!

Decor: The decor was nice. Ample space and simple decor. It seemed clean and no funny smells haha!

Staff: Our waitress was good. She was efficient, kind, and helpful. 

Drinks: My girlfriend ordered a Peach Long Island - it was sweet, boozy, and delicious. I had the Red Sangria ($8 X2 haha) and it was pretty good. I enjoyed that it wasn't sweet and made with a weird Moscato or Lambrusco. 

Food: I don't want to speak for my girls friend but I can say she had a short stack on a gluten free bun with the regular fries which are gluten free. They do have a list of what is gluten free so ask. I had a Cajun turkey burger ($7) with pepper jack cheese ($1), lettuce/tomato/dill pickle/mushrooms on a kaiser roll and Cajun aioli with a $2 add on of curly fries. IT WAS AMAZING!!!!! I mean routinely I don't like turkey burgers but DAMN this thing was out of this world good. I would totally order this exact same burger again and again and again. 


Overall: The turkey burger I had to me was enough to make me come back. The entire experience otherwise could have sucked and I'd endure it for this turkey burger."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Kids liked being able to design their own burgers. We had the nachos as a starter and they were good too. Waitress was super friendly and attentive. Quick service. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!

We did not order appetizers and had one draft beer. We ordered 5 adult meals and one kids meal. 

Pros: onion rings were thick and delicious, kids plates are a frisbee that is taken home, and kids get free Samsung tablets to play with while waiting for food. 

Cons: French fries were extremely salty, burgers were overcooked, buns were not fresh, shakes were watery, and my son had an olive in his kids' fruit salad (initially looked like a grape!). The melons in the fruit salad were old. Service was slow despite it not being crowded at 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon. 

Bottom line- would much rather go to Burgatory, BRGR or even Red Robin!"}
{"text":"Stack'd is great if your expectations are set to the right level. This is not fine dinning, of course, but it was great for a very casual dinner when a good burger is the goal. 

Everyone in my party had a burger, one from the menu and two \"build your own\".  No one was oooohing and aaahing over their food, but everyone was was perfectly happy with what they got (and the glutten-free bun choice was appreciated). The side salads were fine, nothing spectacular but perfectly adequate. A nice selection (30ish?) of beers were available on tap. 

The service was good - friendly and reasonably prompt - and it was not too loud even though we were there on a fairly busy Friday evening. Having signed in on NoWait ahead of time, we were seated immediately upon arrival.

I would certainly go again when it is what the occasion calls for."}
{"text":"We loved our seating near the gas fireplace. The Buffalo Potato Skins were great! I had the Shroom Burger and was pretty good. Not as many mushrooms as I expected. My husband ordered from the create your own menu. His burger was good too. It's an affordable casual dining experience."}
{"text":"No happy hours on weekend. Had a few drinks and appetizers. The nachos were nice but don't get the pork if you're not into sweet stuff. The BBQ they smother the pork nachos in is a bit sweet. Stick with the chili and chicken. Also, the \"buffalo\" potato skins are your regular cheese and bacon carved out potato skins with a drizzle of Buffalo sauce served with a side of sour cream. Ok. Not great. Will be back to try other things on the menu - hopefully during happy hour."}
{"text":"Went last night for the first time. Great atmosphere, however the food wasn't very good. After being there for 45 mins and not seeing any burgers coming out of the kitchen we thought that was odd, and then found out why. Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"New place in Wexford.  Typical gourmet burger place.  Their food tasted great and you got enough to be filled.  Varied beer selection, with reasonable prices.  We have been twice and will return again.  Bar space is tight.  They are available on NoWait app for reservations."}
{"text":"Not a fan
I mean, for a place that is supposed to specialize in burgers they arnt very good. I ordered the jalapenos as a topping and it came with ONE round slice attached to a toothpick on top.   We live right near here and never chose to go. Boring atmosphere too. Too much open space makes it feel like a cafeteria. I gave 2 stars because the bar area is okay."}
{"text":"Nice to have a new casual dinning place in Wexford. The atmosphere is nice with a clean and open floor plan. We sat at the tables with the little metal chairs . The chairs are very short and uncomfortable. As I looked around there really was not a lot of seating that would work for a elderly person or someone with needs. 
The wait was a little confusing as it seems they take reservations? Maybe they use a app? This is not clear on the website. 
We ordered a kids meal, made to order hamburger and a milk shake. All where good and very large portions. Surprised the child's ice cream could've fed both adult and child at the table. I also ordered the dark and stormy! It was so yummy and I almost had 2. 
Next time I go I will figure out how to make a reservation and how to get a more comfortable place to sit. Looking forward to trying that again."}
{"text":"If you have looked at my other reviews, you'll notice that I like burgers. So when I heard about Stack'd, I had to make haste a get there as quick as possible. Very glad that I did!

Much like Burgatory, you get to create your own burger here or pick from one of their pre-built burgers. I'm of course going with create your own. Now, compared to Burgatory, there may not be as many options but more than enough in my opinion and, they have a few really nice options that aren't found elsewhere such as Onion Rings and Fried Pickles to add to your burger. Additionally, you can pick how many patties you want. 1/4 lb., 1/2 lb., 3/4 lb., etc.  I think that is a nice touch and hence the name, Stack'd.  You can add a side of fries or tots for a couple bucks as well. Now I loved the variety of fries here. You want regular plain Janes, cool!  How about Old Bay fries or maybe Cajun fries? Well you can at Stack'd!

I ended up with a 1/2 lb. burger on a pretzel bun with blue cheese, spicy garlic bbq sauce, grilled onions (I actually asked for grilled mushrooms but I digress), jalapeños, lettuce, tomato and onion rings with a side of Old Bay Fries. Not much I can say besides I really, really liked this burger!  And those Old Bay fries were incredible!  A few things that I noted were of course ordering grilled mushrooms and receiving onions however, it tasted fine and, most burger places will ask you how you want your burger cooked. This didn't happen on my visit but the burger was prepared flavorfully. I may have liked it a little more on the medium side if I were asked.

The service was really good aside from the mushroom incident. Our waitress was quick, friendly and attentive. I liked the look and atmosphere of the place as well. I'd have liked to sit outside on their patio but rain was on the way today.  I'll be back in the future for that and a few beers from their craft list.  Today I opted for one of their Milkshakes. The Caramel Pretzel to be exact. At the end of the meal, I asked for one to go which they happily obliged. It was a good decision!  

While Burgatory will always be my first love, Stack'd has definitely become my side piece!"}
{"text":"Nice, warm, comfortable atmosphere. Courteous and attentive staff. Good appetizers and burgers and what appears to be a nice selection of beverages. Fair prices and an inviting place. We will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I had such a nice evening at Stack'd. We ordered the jalapeno poppers and each had burgers. My husband ordered the OMFG hot sauce and loved it. The atmosphere is modern and warm. The staff was warm and inviting. The prices are great. We'll be back with the kids soon."}
{"text":"My family has been to Stack'd close to a dozen times. On a regular night, I would give it four stars. Last night was awful. I \"got in line\" using the nowait app, which estimated an 11 minute wait. 50 minutes later, we were seated. No issues ordering, however our food came, we had no napkins or silverware, no drink refills, and the food was clearly rushed. The slice of cheese on my sandwich wasn't melted and my fries were undercooked. Lastly, we had to flag someone down to actually pay our check. Not one person said a peep about the wait or poor service."}
{"text":"I chose to try the boneless chicken wings and tator tots instead of the burger.  My reasoning was because all burgers are grilled to medium well and I'm not okay with that.  I chose the Caribbean jerk dry rub.  The wings were meaty, though I would of liked a little more spice.  Overall the food was good and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Burger and brew. What's not to love here?! 

I've been here twice so far. Both times I've left full and happy. 

Let's talk burgers. If there's one thing this place is good at, it's burgers. Both times I've been here I've created by own burger. I enjoy the \"art\" of creating my own burger from the bun up. It's rather satisfying. There are lots of options for every part of your burger. Brioche, pretzel bun, wheat, Texas toast... all delicious options for your bun. I LOVED getting Texas toast. You can also choose what kind of burger you want: 1/4 lb, 1/2 lb, cajun turkey burger, chicken sandwhich. I opt for the 1/4 lb. burger. It's just right for me. Topping options are literally endless. Multiple cheese options, over a dozen sauces (I HIGHLY recommend the house sauce!), multiple burger toppers like pickles, cucumbers, lettuce, field greens, potato chips, peanut butter, banana (Yes, you read that right.), tomato, onion, salt, pepper, fried egg, avocado, bacon... literally endless options. I can tell you that the bacon and egg are excellent options. I've tried the potato chips, but they just get soggy. 

The fries here a really good too! Love the fresh cut fries that have! 

Also, do yourself a favor if you come here and get a milkshake. The butterfinger and Nutter Butter are excellent choices. 

My ONLY pick with this place is that it's too much like Burgatory. (Hence, the 4/5 stars.) There was nothing that I saw that made Stack'd a step above Burgatory. I'm still a bigger fan of Burgatory, but in Wexford, this is a fine option."}
{"text":"Good burgers and ok ambience...too loud at times but I guess that's the way sports bar are supposed to be...(last couple of times the lettuce in my burger was limp, though) but other than the ingredients offered are good and the quality of the burgers is good...I have to say that I don't really like the fact that the offer free iPads to keep children entertained..."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times since my initial review. I have tried the build your own chicken sandwich which was alright, but most recently I am a big fan of the 1/2lb Classic Burger. Stack'd's version of the classic cheeseburger is definitely one of the better high pre-built classic burgers in the area, and you can't beat the price with a generous serving side. (The tater tots are a perfectly cooked choice!)

My initial review dings the restaurant on the beef patties missing on flavor, but as of yesterday the patties were pretty delicious! I'd definitely eat this burger again."}
{"text":"Stack'd took over the space formerly occupied by Bonnie & Clyde's in Wexford. We do enjoy burgers so we wanted to check it out. 

We sat at the bar and were told it was Happy Hour with half off all drinks and appetizers. Sounds good, right? Appetizer list was loaded with things like nachos, cheese sticks, fries, etc. with only 1 appealing item - fried pickles - but they were awesome. 

We both decided to build our own burgers, which was a fun process and they have a ton of options that didn't feel nearly as overpriced to customize as Burgatory. My burger was pretty good. The pretzel bun I paid a little extra for wasn't that great but I liked the toppings and my burger was tasty & cooked correctly. 

The beer list has the usual suspects you find in most bars plus a couple of local brews and the Sauvignon Blanc was Mondavi, so we opted for their spicy Old Fashioneds. Possibly the most watery tasting drink I've had in years. We shared a shot of a really good bourbon later that was a much better choice. 

Overall, fried pickles and a burger I'd definitely get again. Next time I'll order a beer to go with it. 
3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Visited this location a few times, good food and good service that is usually pretty quick. Nachos are good for a starter, quality chicken for the meat. The bison burger is really good, and making your own burger is convenient. It's definitely better than other places to make your own burger. Don't really care for the sweet potato fries, they do not have any seasoning on them and are very bland. Everything else is really good! Recommend checking the app to see if there is a wait as well."}
{"text":"Walked in for the first time and was told 25min wait for just the two of us. We walked to the bar and immediately sat down and decided to just eat at the bar. I tried 3 different different brews of beer with the blood dog being my favorite. My fiancé had a strawberry mixed drink that was pretty good. 
Atmosphere was nice and enjoyable. We had an order of fried mac and cheese to start. Even though it was good, it was a little over fried which made them a little hard. I \"stacked\" my own burger with bison, a pretzel bun, lettuce, tomato, jalapeños and ranch. It was really good and I would for sure eat it again. My fiancé had the Cajun chicken salad. The chicken was really good but the salad overall was mediocre. 
Overall you could tell the staff was still learning their way around but service was great and we really  enjoyed this place and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food and service fine.  Parking fine.  Easy access all around.  But for me there is just too much food on the plate.  If I were falling timber in Oregon I could eat there for lunch but needs to be smaller offering."}
{"text":"The best part about Stack'd is you order your burger on a sheet of paper. Select the bread, protein, and topping you want before handing it off the the waiter. This saves you the shame of rattling off the mile long list of unhealthy and delicious shit you've decided to subject your body to in front of your table and the wait staff. 

My burger came cooked to order with my embarrassing pile of selections just like I wanted. My disregard for health never tasted so good."}
{"text":"Been here twice.  
Burgers are cooked to order, craft beer selection was great.   Sweet potato fries were hot and fresh. Wings requested extra crispy and came out such, were delish. 
Service both times was very good."}
{"text":"Stack'd is a wonderful, upbeat restaurant in the Wexford and Pine Township community. The food is really good; the service is on point; and the atmosphere is comfortable. My family always looks forward to going!"}
{"text":"Mikey was an amazing server! While the food and drinks were delicious, Mikey is what made our experience magical. He made sure we received our customized drinks to perfection and his smile brightened our day. His charisma is as magical as a unicorn on a moped driving over the rainbow. If you go make sure you ask for him."}
{"text":"Quick service, juicy burgers, and tons of good options on the menu to choose from. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Super cool place! Food was really good. Highly recommend a milkshake and burger. Get the curly fries rather than the regular. Super fun and cool environment. Honestly want to go back and try it again because the menu is so diverse."}
{"text":"First, the good: we were able to get seated right away in what seemed like a really busy lunch, the interior was well designed, and the menus were very easy to understand.

The ok: I ordered a custom burger, with many things I like (wheat bun, jalapenos, spinach, etc.). It came out and everything I wanted was there, but honestly the burger part was just mediocre. There was no ordering a temperature, and I like my burgers medium or medium-well and it seemed well done. 

To give Stack'd credit, I believe they have some good specials on certain days. If I were to try it all over, I probably would order something other than a burger."}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday evening.  Got in line via NoWait and arrived at the recommended time, then still had to wait another 30 minutes.  Decent beer list including East End Big Hop, one of my favorites.  As for the food, nothing special.  If you've been to any of the \"high end\" burger joints like Burgatory or BRGR, this is somewhere between those and five guys.  Burgers with fries or tater tots, a couple of salad options, lots of fried appetizers.   Our group of 3 had two burgers and a quesadilla.   Everything just average at best.  Not likely to return, plenty of better options in the area in the same price range.

1 extra star for the Big Hop."}
{"text":"Very good burgers and fries.  We started with the nachos which were disappointing as they came in a bowl and felt like they just tossed some cheap tortilla chips in the bowl with a few bits of chicken and dumped some canned nacho sauce on top and microwaved it. Very disappointing appetizer."}
{"text":"The space was really great.  The tables were not to close together and we did not feel like we were crowed or squeezed for space.  The service was a little slow but that can be expected on opening day.

All and all, the food was good and I am sure we will be back!"}
{"text":"Same concept as Burgatory but with better service and more options! Our food came out quickly and the milkshakes were decadent. No wait at all. An upbeat, modern and clean environment. A very well stocked bar. I don't have a single complaint about this restaurant. I'm just afraid it is a fad and won't last a long time in this location."}
{"text":"Stopped in around 11:30 am. Plenty of seating inside or outside. Not overly bright inside. Staff was nice. You can pick from the menu, or grab a pencil from your table and check off on a form the type of burger you want. Many options. I stacked mine pretty high with meat, pretzel bun, cheese, onion, mayo, lettuce, tomato. There are way more option than I made for myself. They offer more than burgers. The burger I had was juicy and not a frozen patty. I also ordered fries which were crisp. Overall, a nice clean place to have a tasty meal."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I was very satisfied both times. Both times I did the create your own burger, which can be overwhelming because there are soooo many options but also a lot of fun! It's a lot like Burgatory but a different atmosphere. They have milkshakes for children and adults as well, which I'll be excited to try the next time I'm there. I definitely recommend this place!"}
