{"text":"This is the restaurant that prompt me to sign up and write a review. It has nothing to do with its excellency because sadly it has none. As soon as you walked into the restaurant, it's hot. There was no ventilation, simply fans in there circulating the hot air coming from the kitchen. When you inform the staffs, they simply say that's what you get going to a restaurant that serves hot food. When every customer ask  about the unbearable temperature inside, staffs just tells the customers they are wrong. I guess majority rules simply does not apply in this place. As other reviews has mentioned, the staffs here are rude, actually it's beyond rude. Food are served terribly slow. When the food can't come out fast enough, staffs makes no apologies and just keeps customers waiting. And when the customers can no longer wait ; demanded the bill. The staffs refuses to give them the bill. And after the customers left, the staffs talk loudly behind the customers back. Complaining about how they ask for too many napkins and big a mess at the table. (Mind you those were elderlies) They staff went on questioning how these elderlies ever trained their kid and their grandchildren. Wow, I highly suggest these staffs worry about themselves first, because with a business running by these jokers I simply can't foresee them staying for long.

**sadly yelp does not let me review with zero star, because this is the one star that it does not deserve"}
{"text":"The environment and customer service is amazing. I got my meal really fast and it was perfectly hot. Soup taste great and the noodles are soft. My favourite noodle place. Has a great selection of food and the prices is also reasonable"}
{"text":"I personally enjoyed their original fish soup and their cold milk tea. Service was great and the food was delivered pretty quickly. Similar to dear garden the menu was very personalized for the customer. They are able to select different soup base, types of noodles, toppings and drinks. It seems that the restaurant did not use msg, but rather real and fresh ingredients for their broth. The soup was missing a little salt , but a little pepper will do the trick. In addition, they do serve bo jai fan (casserole rice)as well. Overall, I enjoyed my meal here."}
{"text":"Stop by for a quick lunch, they have both noodle and rice pot, would have tried the rice one but have to wait 20 mins. instead getting the selection for noodle, adding fish ball, and sliced beef. Also ordered fry wing and pork slice. The food is good to enjoy in a short time. Will stop by for rice pot next time."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and they were good! Soup based was clean yet flavorful. Every ingredient was delicious. Not sure why they closed down"}
{"text":"A copycat of Deer Garden again?!  But this place cloned badly!! Soup is way too salty. I ordered ramen, but their ramen wasn't ramen. Beef tendon and octopus balls were both flavorless.  The casserole rice wasn't well cooked.  The worst is............. there were a lot of flies; they buzzed around and tap danced on our table.  The waitress came over and said, \"They come coz our food smell good!\"  She rolled up a piece of paper and hit a fly on our table!! Lost my appetite right when the fly was certified!"}
{"text":"Don't know the name fool you, this place is basically Deer Garden is disguise, lol.

Pros:
You pick what goes in your noodle
Staff are friendly

Cons:
Not as good as their Deer Garden counterpart

If you've been to Deer Garden, you have basically been here too.  It's the exact same system here, right down to the menu.  There are a few subtle differences here and there but it's pretty much the same menu you're dealing with.  

If you've never been, here's the lowdown.  You pick your broth, two toppings, type of noodle, an optional side and a drink (which they charge for here).  I do like places that give you that much choice.  It's $8.99 for the noodle plus any extras you may order.

I ordered my usual broth which is the Chao Chou dried fish and minced pork fish soup with \"ramen noodles\".  My GF got the original fish soup with ho fun noodles.  The orders come out pretty quickly. My \"ramen noodles\" were basically thicker rice nooldes which was a disappointment.  I usually go with egg noodles and Deer Garden but they didn't have that here.  The broth was also not as rich as Deer Garden's as well.  My GF's fish soup was much better though not as rich as well.  They do give you a lot of noodles here.  You will be full at the end of your meal.

At Deer Garden, a hot drink comes with the noodles and you pay $1 extra for a cold drink.  Here they charge you 75 cents for the hot drink and an extra $1.50 for cold.  I know it's not the world, but it does effect you on whether you get the drink or not.  This place is also a lot smaller.  There are about 10-15 tables so if it's busy, expect to wait a little. 

The service was the highlight of our meal.  The staff were very friendly and patient.  They interacted very well with our little one.  She even gave thema high five on our way out which is crazy because she's usually very shy around new people now.  

I know this review was more of a comparison to Deer Garden, but when you run the same model as them, there's no better way to review than a comparison.  All in all, I think Deer Garden is better, but I won't fault anyone for coming here too."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner at around 7ish and it was pretty empty, only a few tables were occupied. But then again, the space is quite small :/

To put it simply, service was really nice but the food wasn't.

All their noodles and fish balls taste like something that I can make at home -_-'
Pretty sure they bought all the toppings from the frozen foods section at T&T next door lol.
It was really bland and didn't taste good but their rice in stone pot was not bad! They make it when you order it so it does take some more time. However, I was surprised that it actually tasted quite nice and it was crispy at the bottom too. 
So instead of noodles, try their rice~

2 stars for food +1 for nice service!"}

It is hard not to compare Langham Delight to Deer Garden! Same concept of pick your Combination noodle, soup base and toppings. Knows your competitors and price accordingly is quite important for success in business.

Langham Delight at $8.99 for the most basic combination and that does not even includes a free hot drink! And in order to upgrade to a combo, you will need to pay 75 cents more or $1.50 for a cold drink.

Quality, Quantity and Value is not as good as Deer Garden and why would customers willing to pay more for less...

Original Fish Soup with Rice Noodle and 2 Toppings ($8.99) + $1.50 for Lemon Iced Tea were OK. 

No House Made Chili Sauce.. 

Personally, I think Langham Delight should at least build in the drinks in their Combination Noodle. Diversifying the menu with more offerings with less emphasis fish soup noodle might be better for their success down the road.
