{"text":"Wow - was coming through area on work trip and saw this on the Yelp map. Clean and welcoming. Had the Pho (first timer) - blew me away! So good! Honestly, if I had extra time, I probably would have ordered another bowl."}
{"text":"Very good Thai iced tea, spring rolls, and vermicelli bowl with eggrolls! The pad thai was just okay. The staff was super friendly. Very clean and quick service too!"}
{"text":"Food here is really good but the service is TERRIBLE. They need to have better management of their employees. There were 3 girls literally running around the store half-helping guests but still MANY dissatisfied customers."}
{"text":"Had the Shrimp Pho (P11) and it was great.  Service was friendly and just fine.  Everyone in my party had no complaints.  First visit for me and will definitely be back especially since there isn't much cuisine diversity in Anthem."}
{"text":"The Pho broth was amazing! Such great flavor and great portion size! We also tried the spring rolls! So delicious! I will definitely be coming back! I haven't have Pho this good in a long time! Definitely the best since moving to Arizona! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Walked in and ordered pho and tangerine chicken to go. Was told it would be 20 minutes, took an hour. Then broth was lukewarm when got it home. Guess we will be finding somewhere else to get pho."}
{"text":"This area really needed a place like this.  The service is friendly, and the food is generally excellent.  It's the only Vietnamese joint for at least 20 miles.  The only drawbacks are the limited seating and the small kitchen size, which can lead to occasional slow/inconsistent service.  If you have the time, it's a great place to eat."}
{"text":"So excited to have a vietnamese place so close!! Spring rolls are crispy and delicious, and the vermicelli (sp) bowl was very good! I usually order pho and was excited to try a new dish and loved it! Their pho is tasty, definitely hits the pho craving spot!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food was GREAT and AWESOME service. Our waiter was very nice and friendly. There was 10 of us and all of us enjoyed the food. They also give nice portion of food worth the money. The smoothie drink was soooo gooood. This will be our #1 pho restaurant. Who ever gave this place 1 star it's NOT TRUE. I will give this place 10 stars."}
{"text":"So this is NOT a place you want to bring a first date unless you absolutely positively know he/she is into this kind of stuff. It's neither romantic and they don't serve any alcohol. BUT MY GOD IS THEIR FOOD GREAT!!! It falls into the category of hidden gems, if you like Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was great.  The soup is the star standout though. Portions are large,  and easily enough for two people."}
{"text":"Delicious pho! 
Happy we stopped in after shopping in Anthem. Some of the best broth around., made me wish I'd ordered it too after tasting my husbands bowl.   I had the crepe which was stuffed full and delicious as well."}
{"text":"Great place. My wife and I have been looking for a healthy, tasty, 
Vietnamese restaurant for sometime but none come close to this place. The meals taste great and are healthy too. We eat there often. Great service too.  Can't go wong."}
{"text":"Stopped in for late lunch of Spring Rolls and special Pho. Both were very good. I will make this stop again when returning home."}
{"text":"I have never had Pho so my mom and I decided to try this place. Looks very clean, the employees were friendly and helpful. I ordered chicken Pho which was amazing. My mom had the vegetarian Pho which was great too. We got a lot of food for our money. I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. Service is generally slow and it usually takes quite a while to get your food. If there is any type of a crowd in there at all. The food is delicious and everybody is generally pretty friendly. Will be going back again for sure maybe between lunch and dinner the noodle bowls are great"}
{"text":"Love this local restaurant.  Great service and the Pho Vegetable soup is my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area and I was in search of a good pho place and unfortunately this place was a let down.  The service was excellent and the egg rolls were delicious but the chicken pho and the vegetarian pho were huge letdowns.  I really wanted this place to be good since the reviews were all good but the pho broth was so plain and tasteless.  I don't like spicy things but I had to put a good amount of sriracha and soy sauce in my pho to make it taste better.  My boyfriend and I didn't finish our pho and we left unsatisfied :("}
{"text":"Glad to have another nearby pho option. Delicious Vietnamese curry with just the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"This is a great little place for a substantial bowl of pho. All fresh and tasty! The Shrimp Cakes are great, too! 
It's a nice quick place to eat in or take out!"}
{"text":"I've only been once but I really enjoyed the tangerine  chicken and my wife loved the curry. We'll definitely eat here again. For the price, it's a great value. And the staff were cheerful and very helpful!!"}
{"text":"An unexpectedly delish bowl of pho, tucked into the Alerbertson's shopping plaza off of I-17 and Carefree Highway.  It's a tiny little place, but neat and tidy, with terrific customer service, and staff who are exceptionally happy and poliet.  My kind of place!"}
{"text":"We've been waiting for this place to open since we saw the paper on the windows!
1st time to visit this New Vietnamese restaurant in North Phoenix was Great!  
Service-We were seated promptly upon entering the restaurant at approximately 5:45pm on Monday evening.  We were given menus & brought water right away.  We perused the small, but inclusive of all our favorite Vietnamese dishes menu.  We ordered our appetizer & meals in a short time.  Our appetizer came quickly & we were able to finish before our main meal arrived.  Our waiter was very attentive to our needs/drinks.  We received Really Good Service.
Appetizer- 4 Egg Rolls...came out very quickly with lettuce & standard vinegar dipping liquid.  Hot & tasty.  We finished our appetizer before our main meal arrived.
Main Meal-Chicken Pho & Rare Beef Pho
The Pho Broth for both dishes included a generous amount of green onion & a fresh, rich flavor before adding the fresh jalepeno pepper slices, lime wedge, basil, & bean sprouts Chicken Pho-contained large, thin pieces of white meat chicken.  Rare Beef Pho-large, thin, rare beef pieces; along with a generous portion of Rice noodles in each.

We really enjoyed our dinner & 1st visit.  Will definitely be returning & suggest you try Pho Saigon Pearl for yourself!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Pho is my favorite food, so I try it everywhere I go. I just moved to the area 6 months ago and tried several different places in the area; however, after eating here I will not go to a different Vietnamese restaurant.

Everything about this restaurant is great and the staff is fantastic. I usually call in my order and pick it up to go. They have never gotten an order wrong and they always tell me how long until it is ready (usually 15 minutes), but it never takes that long.

The food is the best I've had anywhere. I am very picky about my pho and they are always very accommodating whenever I specialize my order. The broth has great flavor and all the ingredients are so fresh it seems they were picked that day. They take the time to cut the fat from the meat and only serve the best parts. Every dish I have tried has been outstanding.

If you like pho or any other Vietnamese dish, then you MUST go here. Even if you have never tried this style of food I highly recommend it. Since I started eating here I have introduced more than a dozen of my friends and family to the food here and every single one has loved it. I have eaten here over 20 times in the last 6 months and I plan to continue eating here just as frequently, if not more."}
{"text":"Solid pho noodle soup, spring rolls, Vietnamese egg rolls, and Vietnamese coffee. 

They had bun bo hue as a special for while and finally added it to the menu full time which is a plus for me. Great spice!

I also like that they open at 10AM to beat the lunch rush."}
{"text":"A paragon of courtesy with a good bowl of pho. They gave me water immediately after I ordered a Thai Iced Tea. The servings were plentiful. My mum enjoyed a free appetizer to boot."}
{"text":"Great service yummy little sausage on the appetizer platter. I'd go back just for a plate of that."}
{"text":"Awesome pho!! Everything fresh and hot. A small portion of pho is a large at all the other pho restaurants I've been to. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because hubby wanted a sandwich and was told that they didn't carry sandwiches..yet. Somewhat disappointing since there was sandwiches listed on the menu. Also restaurant is closed on Tuesdays so I'm not sure if that was a Yelp error or restaurant because I checked the hours of service on Yelp. But will definitely return for the pho!!!"}
{"text":"I took my kids out for some Vietnamese food, or what I call 'food', two weekends ago. We ordered the Special Pho with spring rolls for appetizers. Speaking from someone who has had many bowls of Pho over the last 40 years from Little Saigon in SoCal to Pho Le in Saigon, Vietnam to my mother's kitchen, bowls of Pho at Saigon Pearl do not disappoint! 

The combination of meat balls and thinly sliced beef were very tasty. The broth was made perfectly and I almost wanted to eat it without adding any sauces. For a moment, I felt like I was sitting at my mother's kitchen table slurping down a home cooked meal after being away for awhile. 

The rice paper that wrapped the spring rolls were moistened perfectly. They weren't too mushy or too hard and the shrimp, pork belly, and vermicelli rice noodles tasted great with the dipping sauce. 

The only thing I wish was different was the classic cafe su da or Vietnamese style iced coffee. It tasted great, but was presented in a boba tea style cup. I wish it was ice in the glass with condensed milk and a coffee infuser on top dripping that black gold into that delectable beverage. 

Overall, Pho Saigon Pearl serves great tasting authentic Vietnamese cuisine without breaking the bank. The atmosphere there is great and I can't wait to go back and try the Vietnamese crepes. Well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Despite being a pho place we ordered the stir fry noodles and the pan fried noodles with shrimp cakes... ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I've been to a lot of Vietnamese restaurants and this one by far has been my favorite. Not to mention the service is wonderful! We will definitely be coming back! Maybe next time we'll try the pho!"}
{"text":"The Vietnamese Noodle Bowl was great. Very fresh veggies. Wished the chicken was just a little leaner. But the flavor was great. Saw the Pho Bowls and they looked great, too."}
{"text":"It's gotten better! The Pho has more flavor and the servers are more attentive. Thank you Kathy! 

Any chance the egg rolls can increase in size for the amount customers pay ??"}
{"text":"Terrible Pho. Worst I have ever had! We ordered Pho and a appetizer and chicken lo mien. It was all bland and not fresh."}
{"text":"So fresh!!  I cant tell you about too many things on the menu, because I always get the Vietnamese curry, but I have dreams about how good it is.  Get the spring rolls as well.  They have the best peanut sauce I've ever had in Phoenix :)"}
{"text":"The best in North Phx. Consistently quality and great flavor every visit. At least once every week"}
{"text":"Food was good, fresh and flavorful. Interesting salad dressings. New location is comfortable and clean. There were five people with me and everyone ordered something different. All liked what they ordered.

The reason I did not give more stars is because they brought out each order about 5 minutes apart with no focus of the ladies being served first and what side to serve from. We had to ask for napkins. When we were done there was no attempt to clear the table. A bit cluttered to say the least. 

It is very evident that the servers have never been (or poorly) trained, nor has the cook(s) been trained to synchronize the food prep time for service. It's too bad because the food is good and I truly wish them success.  

If you have the patience of Job, and lots of time on your hands, then I highly recommend a visit to enjoy their food."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical going here because I have had a few bad pho experiences in the past but I figured what the heck, it's right by my house and the reviews are good... Boy am I glad I did!!! I called in a Togo order since it is a smaller place and I was ordering during the heart of lunch. It was a full house when I showed up but I was in and out in less than 2mins with my order.
So I ordered the pad Thai, appetizer Sampler, Vietnamese crepe, and my girlfriend got the veggie pho with chicken substituted for tofu... EVERYTHING WAS INCREDIBLE! I'm not a huge pho fan but it was a massive portion (easily enough for 2) and my girlfriend loved it! As far as the pad Thai, it was really flavorful and a large enough portion for 2 to 3 meals. I liked everything in the sampler (the wings are out of this world). I really enjoyed the Vietnamese crepe as well. I wasn't a fan of the lettuce wrap idea but by itself with the sauce is something ive never had before but would order it again in a heartbeat. The price was reasonable for a meal for one but every entree portion is easily enough for at least 2. I will most definitely return!!! I'm glad I found this place."}
{"text":"I moved up to Prescott recently and have been craving pho. I tried Saigon Pearl earlier this week. Unfortunately, I was not impressed. I ordered summer rolls with shrimp and veggie pho. The rolls were good, but not great. They were fairly thin compared to some that I've had and not worth the $6 price tag. The veggie pho though was the real disappointment. The vegetables were thrown into the hot broth and were basically raw when the soup arrived. And the selection of vegetables included two tiny pieces of baby bok choy, 3  very large pieces of raw onion, one which included the brown skin that should have been cut away, 3 - 4 pieces of sliced raw carrot, 2 long pieces of raw celery and 3 - 4 stalks of raw broccoli. Unfortunately, most of the pieces of vegetable were too large to eat without biting off a chunk and then difficult to chew. I'm just a little surprised that you haven't figured out that the vegetables should at least be partially cooked and small enough to get into your mouth. The broth was good though so I imagine that your meat selections are better. I would just recommend putting a little more effort into the veggie version so that it's edible."}
{"text":"Okay, disclaimer: I'm from SoCal where pho is plentiful and dirt cheap so my five stars is for Phoenix locations.

We frequent Pho Saigon Pearl often because we love pho and it's close to our house.  The staff is always very courteous, we never have to wait long for food even when it's busy, and the restaurant and bathrooms are always clean.  They're not the cheapest (around $10/bowl) but portions are generous.

I appreciate them a lot because whenever we come with our kids they provide us with extra bowls, spoons, and scissors to cut food without us even asking.  Being accommodating to families is a huge plus and it makes it a lot easier to go out without having to haul around extra stuff for the kids.  

My only qualm is that the spicy noodle soup isn't very spicy at all, but that's just preference.  Otherwise we enjoy our meals here.  =)"}
{"text":"I was actually on my way to another spot... So it was a nice surprise when this place popped up on my search on the way home.  I Did take out 4 days ago and it was delish.  Brought the family in tonight and it was  even better!  Lu (not sure of the spelling) and the staff were pleasant and attentive.  I asked for the biggest pho bowl they had and they accommodated (wasn't on the menu).  My wife and 2 young daughters loved their veggie pho. They were out of a dessert that we wanted to try but Lu and staff made up for it by giving my girls each a mini ice cream Sundae.  Will def be regulars here. The girls Prob won't have a choice anymore. :-)"}
{"text":"When this place initially opened the service was ok. Now after having been open several months the service is terrible.
After arriving and being served water very quickly, it took at least 10-15 min before having our order taken which included soft drinks. After waiting another 10 minutes with no drink I took it upon myself to poor them. Sitting the the table another 3-4 min soft drinks were brought over much to the dismay of the hostess.

This occurred the second time after I had returned from a previous time hoping the poor service was a one off. Not so much- not a place to return because the food is average."}
{"text":"A return visit was in order, as the owner had mentioned that they continue to work on developing bolder flavors for their dishes. I ordered the same pho (pho tai) that I had the last time, and indeed the broth was even better this time around. Since I knew that they had excellent banh xeo from my previous visit, this time for appetizer I ordered the Vietnamese golden chicken wings and I must say that those have to be among the very best chicken wings I've ever had! Service is friendly and efficient as before and the prices are good. I definitely recommend this place for an excellent Vietnamese meal if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Really enjoy having a Pho place right around the corner. Have tried a lot on the menu, enjoy the spring rolls but sometimes feel they don't put enough shrimp in them however the peanut sauce is next level. Enjoy a variety of their pho and have never had an issue with any of it. My only complaint is sometimes when I call to get take out I feel as though there is a little language barrier or something gets lost in translation. Other than that I always enjoy my meals."}
{"text":"Pho was poor taste.
Orange Chicken was horrible.
First time tonight to this place and it will be the last!"}
{"text":"Great food I will be back.  We had the Pho and will try the shaken beef next.  Excellent service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"My wife was very pleased with her meal, stated it was the best she has had in north Phoenix. 

Will continue take out orders. 

Now for the details : 

The young woman who took my order at the counter was short and rude but gave a true wait time for food.

The young man working behind the counter acted \"goofy\" and immature.

The restaurant looks very clean and seats maybe seats 25 to 35 people, Nice atmosphere and visually soothing fountain in the entry way.

The smell was a bit overbearing at first, I am not a regular with this cuisine but my wife wanted Thai food and the ratings were 4 star. I became used to the smell during my wait but at first it smelt like a bathroom urinal.

My recommendation is that the food is good and decent cooking time, presentation of food it great. I would recommend the owners speak to the front end staff on customer service and how they are the front line to customers, it would make a great improvement."}
{"text":"I live in the area and another good restaurant of this sort was much needed before it came along! Their food is delicious and full of amazingly fresh vegetables (especially the pho)! Huge portions, strong tea, and overall great selection. However... As a vegetarian I like it when I have the option of replacing meats in dishes with fried tofu, which they don't offer here. Ah well, the veggie pho or other dishes (just without the meat) are still very worth it! My dad really likes the Vietnamese pancake if you're feeling adventurous :)"}
{"text":"The Pearl serves a good pho which doesn't need hoison or hirachi sauce to fix it.
it has a fulsome beef broth with the hints of  cardomon, cinnamon and other spices that make a good pho.  The basil and lime then kick it up a notch on an already good pho.

The goi cuon rolls came in 4s.  2 would have been plenty.  but they were good so it wasn't hard to eat them all.  The sauce was thick with a lot of peanuts.

The curry soup which was under seasoned.  My wife liked this but i didn't like or dislike it.  We often see curry but never curry soup in a vietnamese restaurant so we were glad for the opportunity to try something new.

It's a great stop for a bite on the way from phoenix to flagstaff"}
{"text":"Excellent service. And the food was really good. Their Chicken Wings is a must! I was surprised they had curry. Did not know Vietnamese for had curry.

We had the fried beef curry which turned out to be very good. Unlike Thai curry it does not have a strong coconut taste very much like a Malaysian and Singapore Hainanese Curry."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service. The restaurant is super clean and very nicely decorated. The spring rolls were very refreshing on a really hot day and the chicken pho really hit the spot. I will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time tonight and that's the only reason for the 4 stars. I ordered a chicken pho to go and it was very good. It came with all the trimmings and piping hot. The staff was very friendly and fast. I will update as I try more items on the menu. I guess that answers the question if I plan on going back ;)"}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight. The food was delicious, iced tea fresh 30 min to closing time, and the service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Not a shabby spot, second time eating here on our way back from up North.

First time, the soup Pho-Chicken needs a bit more flavor, for the broth to develop.  The scallions garnish were burnt so took away from the flavor of the soup. 

They are super accommodating and family friendly.  

Will continue to revisit and see if they shift."}
{"text":"YUM!! We got a variety of items to sort of sample the menu. And we were not disappointed!! The Curry, wasn't the best I've ever had, but I would order it again. The Pad Thai was AMAZING!!! Just the right amount of heat, the flavor was bold and cravable. Egg rolls were great, same with the Tangerine Chicken. I don't doubt that the rest of the menu is phenomenal as well.  Can not wait to come back to try more!!!"}
{"text":"Very Good! Very Clean! A lot of food for the price, the veggies and extras included were delicious, replaces our current joint, will be back soon."}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area and some Pho sounded like a great idea! I ordered some Vegetarian egg rolls and Vegetable Pho. The egg rolls were delicious. They came with all the fixings. I didn't like the soy sauce mixture they gave as a dipping sauce, not my style and it was very strong, but the egg rolls themselves were good! The Pho was also tasty. Not the best I've ever had, but tasty all the same. The restaurant is well decorated and comfortable. The server even brought me a sample of some onion rolled up in beef, it was tasty! (I couldn't understand what he was calling it). Overall a lovely lunch and some yummy food! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Where has the Vietnamese Crepe they serve here been my entire life? I had that with the Vegetable Pho and can't wait to go back. I want to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our second visit and we will be back. First time, the appetizer sampler allowed us to explore. The chicken pho and shrimp pho were very good. Tonight, we had spring rolls, Pad Thai, Walnut Shrimp, and two boxes to take home. Hope we see you in the dining room at Pho Saigon Pearls."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is delicious! The newly expanded restaurant is beautiful and allows for more space to enjoy pho in the dining area. Spring rolls are fantastic and their peanut sauce is the best I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"We arrived between lunch and dinner. The restaurant was clean and virtually empty, so the service was excellent. Plenty of easy parking. The food was fresh and served at the correct temperature.

One of the unique and delicious items on their menu is the Vietnamese pancake. It's light, crunchy, & filled with bean sprouts, beef and shrimp. To eat it, you take a fresh lettuce leaf put down some cilantro and fresh mint then wrap a chunk of the pancake and dip it in sauce before pop it in your mouth. This pancake, is one of those items that you would drive over to the restaurant just order."}
{"text":"Soooo....we've been avoiding this restaurant because of my previous review. They advertise boba smoothies and they didn't have it. My uncle likes the place and keeps asking me if we've tried it. We finally did last night. To give them the benefit of the doubt, I wasn't even going to order a boba drink. Then I said, hey why not, maybe they've changed. Lo and behold, they don't have it! The waitress said \"we ran out.\" Seriously, if I went there when the restaurant opens, are they going to have it? Why is it that whenever I go to Sweethearts Donuts, they ALWAYS have boba on hand? Anyway, the food. Mediocre...bland pho broth. Anyone who thinks this is good pho has never tried really good pho. We used to live in Northern Virginia where there is a large population of Vietnamese people and therefore plenty of Vietnamese restaurants so we have tried many different pho recipes, and my husband has been to Vietnam and has tried pho there. The pho at Saigon Pearl is lackluster. I would rather drive to Viet Kitchen, which has never disappointed us. Even if Saigon Pearl is much closer to where we live, it's not enough of a reason for me to go back."}
{"text":"Pad Thai is fresh and yummy also the spring rolls so good!! It's refreshing when you order food and it's all fresh. Great service great business."}
{"text":"I've been to multiple Vietnamese restaurants and absolutely love pho. I have my
Two favorite spots that are amazing (1-3xweek) and this place is pretty good. Honestly had no idea there was one in this area so figured I'd try it out. Will go again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped into this location after grocery shopping and was very impressed. The family staff were very attentive and helpful. The boba tea is to die for. I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking to step outside their taste bud boundaries."}
{"text":"Very nice interior compared to most Vietnamese restaurants.  Menu is smaller than others but everything on it that we tried was top notch. Won't hesitate coming back again. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Placed a to go order this evening at the restaurant. 1. They said it would be 15-20 minutes and it took 35 minutes. 2. Ordered veggie egg rolls and received pork egg rolls.3. There was a hole in styrofoam container for Pho so we lost the majority of the broth by the time we get it home."}
{"text":"Having just relocated from the Bay Area I am more than delighted to have found this new business that just opened in my neighborhood. Honestly I find that little gem to be every bit as good as the better Vietnamese restaurants in San Jose or San Francisco. 

Service can be a bit spotty as the this place is far busier than they expected prior to opening I'm quite sure, but the staff is friendly and the food is DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Had the Pad Thai with shrimp and some spring rolls. This place just opened up and is fairly close to my work so I thought I would give it a try. Everything tasted very fresh and the Pad Thai had quite a few shrimp in it for $8.50, I definitely felt I got my money's worth. The spring rolls were good size and very fresh and the peanut sauce is really a nice balance, I usually don't like peanut sauce but I enjoyed this one. I enjoy supporting local business and look forward to adding this spot to my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"This is a friendly,  clean little place located in the plaza  next to the Chevron gas station. 

We got the pad thai and the Saigon pho. Pho was good,  filled with ingredients instead of skimping on them and serving mostly broth. 

Pad Thai was good as well. Was pleasant with the crunch from the peanuts. It's not spicy at all. A bonus is that they have chili oil on the table if it's too mild for you. 

As an aside,  the portions are generous. I'm sure many of you will be leaving with leftovers. 

We also got a iced coffee that is stronger and more bitter than I would like. Small detail. 

The staff was nice. It's a small space and it did get filled up really quick by they were efficient. Great quick place for lunch!!"}
{"text":"So we tried Saigon Pearl in Nov, 2016, did not enjoy, and said so on Yelp.  In July, the new manager reached out to me on Yelp and said we are new and improved, please try us again.  So we were driving back from up North and decided to pick-up take-out.  Since we were driving past Saigon Pearl, I thought: what the heck!  DH excused himself and said after the last time, he'd have pizza.  

First of all,I pulled the menu up on my phone, and it brought up something called 24houreats and I was able to order directly from the site, rather than memorize my order and call.  I also had the option to pre-pay via cc or PP as well as cash, which was nice.

Saigon Pearl has moved a couple of doors down from where it used to be, and rather than looking like an Asian take-out, it has a nice dining room atmosphere now.  I was greeted pleasantly as soon as I walked in the door.

My food was ready.  Because it was just me, I had ordered the Saigon Special Pho and the vegetarian Summer rolls. 

Took it home and unpacked it.  The Pho broth comes in a separate container, and another box contains the accouterments; rice noodles, cilantro, basil, lime, etc. as well as the meat.  Everything was fresh, but I'd have liked more cilantro.  I LOVE cilantro.  But I had some in the fridge I added. The Summer rolls are 4 to an order and wrapped tightly two and two to keep fresh.

Imho, the Pho is levels above it's previous incarnation.  The broth was rich and satisfying, the meat was pink and lean and the other additions very fresh.  The Summer rolls were so good.  DH took a bite of one and then ate two!  He said they were great (and added some \"veggie\" to his pizza).  He then tasted my Pho and thought that was delish too. I think he was sorry he'd gotten pizza.  I kept having to fend his spoon away from my bowl!

Based on this visit, we will definitely be visiting Saigon Pearl in the near future.  Congratulation to the new manager for turning it around."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I'm really torn about this place.

The staff was friendly and helpful. The food is okay; some of it was very tasty. The fact that it's closer to me than any other Vietnamese place matters, too.

There were a few strange things, like the way someone suddenly turned the music up so loud that my husband and I couldn't hear one another speak. My chicken pho also had bones in it (which happens).

The broth was okay. I think it needed a touch more flavor, but the tofu spring rolls were satisfactory.

I think I'll be back. The challenge is that nothing really shone; however, I really liked the people working there, so I believe I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"This place has a great ambiance with very modern updated furniture and decorations the food has been amazing and the service was plentiful. They definitely deserve their five stars. The calamari was impeccable and the walnut shrimp nicely creamy with perfectly-placed sesame seeds. Price was great too! I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Pho Saigon Pearl doesn't look like it should belong in suburbia Phoenix... that being said because it did taste very authentic.  Personally I have a few reservations though on their menu, it's a be expansive for no reason...  but I don't like giving small businesses 3 stars, and since there is no 3.5, let's go 4.

Why go there:
Swinging there because of some obscure sign on I-17 heading towards Phoenix, I was surprised to find out how good their bowl of pho was.  It was a good portion, the accompaniments made sense. The broth was nice and clear.  The spring rolls weren't the heftiest but the make it up having 4 in a portion which is unheard of.  (You could use a little mint in there Pho Saigon! Offer the traditional fish sauce dip instead of that hoisin and peanut stuff...)

Tip: 
Stick to the restaurant's main game. Which is Pho.
Don't be a hero and try to get orange chicken and expect to get what you're looking for with that order.  Go pho, all the way with all the fixin's."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!  SO good!  Pho Bowl is huge serving, tasty and filling.  Also always get the Pork & Shrimp Rice Roll- so, so good.  Prices are fair, can't complain.  Love that they have free refills on the Soda Fountain drinks, where other Pho places usually have Canned sodas only, purchased separately.  Clean and healthy food- top notch place!  Great service!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Vietnamese food. It's nice because it is around the corner. My issue is pricing I am used to going out with my wife for pho and spring rolls and it's 20-25 not the 40 or so here. Even though it's pricey in my opinion we continue to go because of how delicious the food is ."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Vietnamese and Thai food I've ever had.  They have your typical Vietnames bowls, pho, and some interesting Thai stuff too.  The service is very friendly and fast, the portions are HUGE.  Everyone I've taken here has become a fan."}
{"text":"The main course I had was OK. I eat and a number of Vietnamese restaurant and the food was decent compared to others. My biggest problem with this restaurant was the very  poor service. It took a long time for a waitress to even come over to my table. She took my drink order, it was Vietnamese iced coffee and left. After a very long wait I had a wave down the gal again and ask her for a menu. When I did not get a menu in a while I waved another one of the waitresses down and finally got a menu. I ordered immediately and it still took about 25 minutes to get a bowl of vermicelli  and grilled pork. The Vietnamese iced coffee tasted water down. Not a lot of coffee flavor and it was not even that sweet."}
{"text":"One of my very favorite restaurants in the area. I am from Seattle where Pho is huge and I had a really hard time finding a Pho place that could compare - until now! We eat here at least a few times a month. Food and staff rock!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fast service, every time! Favorite pho location in North Phx."}
{"text":"This place just opened and is absolutely amazing! It is a true diamond in the rough. You can't beat the service and excellent Vietnamese food all for under $10 per plate. The food is always fresh and portions sizes are extremely large, so be sure you come hungry! The owner David is exceptionally friendly and gives the best customer service from a restaurant I've been to in North Phoenix. I will be coming here for many years to come!!!"}
{"text":"Craziest system ever. I went in and placed a to go order. She said 20 minutes. Ok I did a little shopping and came back. After waiting for 45 minutes I asked what the wait was. Did you forget my order. It was fresh rolls and a noodle salad. She told me 10 more minutes because as people come into eat they push back the to go orders. Never going back what a waste of my time."}
{"text":"We had the spicy beef pho and the special pho, both were delicious but we loved the spicy pho more."}
{"text":"Very yummy Pho, delicious egg rolls, super customer service and very clean. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Do not recommend. Very inauthentic pad Thai, and your stomach will confirm this. Never had Thai food so objectionable."}
{"text":"Hubby is picking up some dinner for us!! 
Really hate living an hour north of Phoenix...this small town has no restaurants...
Thanx to places like Pho Saigon Pearl for take- out services!!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that PHo opened so close to my house! They have such great food and super fast as well! I'm already a new regular!"}
{"text":"I am shocked. SHOCKED I say! How is it that on Carefree Highway can I get such a delicious and authentic bowl of bún bò hu? My mom and my sister both live nearby Pho Saigon Pearl, but I had never been there. I fixed that problem on my most recent visit for my nephew's high school graduation, and had this soup before heading over to the ceremony. I called it in and it was ready in like 10 minutes! This place would be a treat in any major city, and here it is in the suburbs of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent however, if you call in a take out order be prepared to wait; if they tell you 20 minutes they really mean 45...this has happened every time.  Additionally, check your food as we have allergies and have had to throw out our meals because they put mushrooms in (even though we request nooooo mushrooms).  

I think because their food is amazing and we don't-have a lot if options up this way...I keep going back."}
{"text":"Decent option in the limited far north Phoenix restaurant scene. They've been busy since they opened and there isn't anything quite like it around. NOT your typical Asian fare. Enjoyed the pho. Entrees were ok. Tangerine chicken a bit dry and overbreaded but the \"soups\" made up for it."}
{"text":"Usually so good!!! I eat here 2-3x month because it's so close to work. I usually get pho and noodles bowls and they're delicious! Came in today with my 8-yr old daughter and ordered Pad Thai and spring rolls. The spring rolls were amazing! But......the pad Thai came out an odd pinkish color. Well, ok it's probably still great cuz everything else has been. The pad Thai tasted off, not exactly quite spoiled, but off. My daughter, who could eat normally an entire plate of Pad Thai took only a few bites. I ate a small portion and had the rest boxed up because something seemed not right. 6 hours later and my super highly energetic daughter is laying sick on the couch. I could barely stomach dinner. I'll be throwing out the doggie bag cuz my husband also thought it smelled slightly spoiled. I think I'll keep coming here for the pho and noodle bowls, but definitely not the pad Thai."}
{"text":"The best phone and salad! It's amazing the best around here so if u want some great photos and salad come and check them out! Great customer service and fast! We will return thanks for the delicious food!!!"}
{"text":"You can order anything on the menu and it will be amazingly fresh! I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates authentic Vietnamese Soups, Salads, Noodle Dishes and of course coffee! I would highly recommend this to all my family and friends!"}
{"text":"This is the most delicious, flavorful pho we have had in a long time. The calamari was also excellent! The wait staff is very friendly and attentive but not overbearing. Very clean ambiance. So glad to have this place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"They just moved into a larger space very nice. More tables TVs added very nicely decorated. The food is always really good. The staff is doing a good job. Very nice people. I believe they will have great success."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Took 16 minutes to get the food then had to wait another 10 to get the sprouts etc. Pho only had a few pieces of steak not worth the high prices."}
{"text":"We did take out from Pho Saigon Pearl and it was delicious! We tried the appetizer sampler - a great way to taste a number of different appy choices. We had the Pho Shrimp, which was great, and the Curry Beef, also yummy! We'll definitely eat here - and enjoy their food at home - in the future!"}
{"text":"Excellent soup base not overpowering.  Great taste and great ingredients. Been there three times and they never failed to provide consistent quality. Great spring rolls with peanut dip."}
{"text":"They have fantastic pho! A nice surprise for the north valley!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing food and everyone is very friendly!  The pho is my favorite but everything else is really good as well. I also like the taro smoothie, they might be getting boba soon too. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on my way south on I 75 as there was a sign on the side of the highway. I was pleasanly surprised. I had the chicken pho and a spring roll. The roll was fresh and presented very nicely. The pho was done perfectly. You would think that it's a dish that's hard to screw up. But I've had it all over the west coast and there are restuarants that can screw it up. Service was fast, efficient, and pleasant. I was catching a late lunch so I didn't  figure that it would be busy but they had more than a few customers. 
I'm a full time RVr so I really rely on everyone's  commments and it helps me considerably when looking for somewhere to eat. I will try to come here again before I leave Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food was descent. Had the combo soup and a beef soup. As well as the egg noodle. Can't complain about the food. But the service was awful. Took three people to take my order. Asked for more lemons and the server brought them in his hands. Got one soup and waited another 10 minutes for the other."}
{"text":"It was a cold winter night right after a rain storm, so why not warm up with some Pho soup! Ordered the Pho Saigon Special. Pretty weak broth flavor. Special meatballs had little pieces of hoof inside. Nearly broke a tooth. The temperature when it finally arived after my girlfriend was halfway done with her order, was luke warm. The teeny bopper waitress opened up the front door because she was hot, letting in all that cold outside air. Good thing I had a jacket in the truck."}
{"text":"First time here. Food is amazing! My son got the tangerine chicken. Delicious! My daughter got the wings, superb! I got the spicy beef soup...so good! My oldest got the Vietnamese curry. Omg. Yummy!"}
{"text":"First time in today with my wife for lunch. Very cute and quaint spot to satisfy our Pho cravings. We ordered #15 Grilled Pork and #10 Rare Beef. Both arrived promptly and were absolutely delicious! Staff was very friendly and soft-spoken so don't be afraid to grab a table and enjoy."}
{"text":"First time here and first time trying Pho and I got to say that I'm a fan. Food tasted super fresh. Only thing was I got it to go and the food wasn't very warm by the time I got home (I live 3 min away). No biggy, I just popped it in the micro and had a very enjoyable and healthy meal."}
{"text":"I was very happy to find this place nearby.  The food was really fresh and very nicely prepared.  The atmosphere was comfortable, and the service was great.  I'd highly recommend the Mie Goreng (Mi Xao).  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This pho place is pretty huge. Pho, egg rolls, and shaking beef was pretty good. Winglee still has the best shaking beef in AZ, but this is second best. I just wish the portion size for shaking beef was slightly larger, but it was still good. Also, I think they should offer an option to substitute white rice for fried rice for a bit extra and that will rival Winglee's legendary shaking beef haha. Egg rolls tasted fresh and delicious, but I do reccomend the owners provide 4 small lettuce wraps instead of 1 small lettuce wrap since we need more to eat all four egg rolls. I didn't eat the pho myself, but my friend who got it said it was pretty good and not too salty like some places. The place currently offers 10% off for grand opening so I reccomend a try before the deal ends! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went in and ordered here for the first time last week.  I have been reluctant to get pho here as I expect most of these places to be too conservative with ingredients. I love tripe in my pho and they did not have it but that is ok.  I got the special combo doubled up on the tendon and got rid of the meatball, I also always order a side of the vegetables from  the vege pho.  They made the pho as I requested no problem and it was good.  I am happy I can get my pho fix.  The chicken wings wings were way better than I expected and will be going in specifically for those on occasion.  Now for the reason I took off a star.  Normally I would have taken off more.  They shorted me an egg roll.   First I was mad it was not there because they were so good.  Two it happens.  Three iI did not feel like going back over for $1.50 worth of product when the rest was so good.   I have been to a lot of vietnamese places not in Arizona and this one is pretty good.  Definitely go here if you want some pho in the area."}
{"text":"Loved the pho! The wait staff was very attentive and accommodating. They special made this pho for me. I don't like a lot of the traditional frills so this was perfect. But with all the original ingredients it looks even more amazing. We have been here a few times so far and plan on brining the kiddos sometime soon."}
{"text":"Great service. Nice people, amazing pho! They have us food very fast and it was nice huge portion sizes."}
{"text":"Opinions, well we all have em. For me this place is a 10star . I been coming here since it first opened up I remember thinking to myself finally a PHO close to me! Now my kids wish we didn't live so close because we have gone sometimes 1 times a week and sometimes 3times a week ! The food is so delicious, seriously the best pho i had yet in the valley  and the staff is even better! This place has become like a second home for us perse.

I have tried the shrimp pho the coconut curry soup and my alltime favorite the pho thai.
Their pad thai chicken AMAZING 
love the fried rice and shrimp pho 
Their spring rolls and rice shrimp rolls are delicious!"}
{"text":"Waited anxiously for this place to open. Have been 4 times in the last 3 weeks. Every time something is majorly wrong. I keep hoping they'll improve but I may have to stop coming. The seating area is way too small. There's always a line to get in. (Good for them I guess.) They don't offer everything on their menu. (Then remove the items. The menu is a laminated piece of printer paper.) The service is not in the order you arrived. You'll have to flag someone down just to get a drink (and it'll take 15 minutes to get to you). The staff has an attitude and it's not friendly. They tried turning away customers 30 minutes before closing and doing only take out. Sorry, you are open so serve people. The only reason I didn't give this place 1 star is because of the food. It's good! So if you do not have high expectations and want good food, come for a couple hours."}
{"text":"5/02/18
Owners opened a new restaurant at another location and took all the cooks and staff to that location. Came in this evening where service was behind by at least 30 minute wait for all customers. I myself have been waiting for over an hour for my spicy beef noodle soup. They have 2 new cooks with a language barrier and have not been able to get my order right. Lost my appetite at this point after the slow service and order not correct the first two times. 3rd times the charm though right? Ugh!!
If you have over an hour to wait for your food go for it. My recommendation wait a few months for them to get their stuff together."}
{"text":"Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but the Tangerine Chicken wasn't good at all, which is a shame because I was excited to try it. I would much rather have Panda Express orange chicken. It looked nothing like the picture they have on their website. In fact, when I first opened the takeout container, I thought they gave me the wrong item. It was BRIGHT orange, and there were a few pieces of mostly yellow broccoli and some shredded iceberg lettuce with two mandarin orange segments in it. There was maybe half the amount of chicken as is shown in the website picture, a definite rip-off for $10. The sauce was about as tasty as it looked. It was fairly bland, didn't have a citrus tang to it at all, but what was worse, it had a chalky texture. I wouldn't say I got food poisoning from it, but my stomach didn't feel so great for the rest of the evening. I might go back someday and try their pho which everyone seems to love, but it's going to be awhile before I do."}
{"text":"We order online and pick up in about 20min.  The food is always ready and correct.   The food is excellent an d the portions are perfect.   We make this a part of our weekly dinner plans."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened but their Pho tastes terrible now. They must have changed their recipe in the past few weeks. We brought it up when we were eating in and they didn't have any reason for it. Almost like they started using tap water instaed of filtered for their broth. Odd. Won't go back till they remedy this. It used to be great!"}
{"text":"Very good and was very pleasantly surprised.  Had the grilled pork with rice noodles and also the tangerine chicken.  Loved both and will be back! Also, they serve Thai food, in addition to Vietnamese and other Asian foods."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout tonight from here. While the food has good taste they are very very frugal with the serving size when it comes to the main entree meat. I ordered the grilled pork and rice. I received two very thin and mostly fat pork slices with a extremely generous and copious serving of lettuce and bean sprouts....YUMMY!! Not impressed with the portion for a dinner plate and very disappointed!! The portion on the other dinner plates were also very disappointing. Now to figure out what else to eat!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time back since they've moved to the new space. finally got to have the Pho!  The broth is wonderful and again, we all enjoyed our meals.  My husband loved his beef pho, I had the chicken and our daughter had a spicy version w/ shrimp I believe.  Our son had them spice up the tangerine chicken and he was very happy. our grandkids enjoyed their teriyaki chicken and rice.  Very nice family atmosphere.  Was told that the delicious broth took 18 hours to create. It was apparent.
Only thing, the soup bowl cooled quickly-wish it would've stayed hot longer.  but still wonderful.  Had enough of mine to take home for a whole dinner!"}
{"text":"I have been there 6 times since they opened and the food has been great every time. They are still working out some of the kinks with regards to wait times and service standards, but that is normal for any new restaurant.  

Try the curry soup, pad Thai and the Pho, totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is great! Love everything on the menu. Thai tea is great, the vermicelli bowls are to die for, and of course, the pho is amazing. You really can't go wrong with anything you try. But the vermicelli is my favorite. The seating area is on the smaller side, but they make it work."}
{"text":"The food was decent. We ordered their combination pho, crepe and rice vermicelli. I took off one star because I was harassed by a fly the entire time I was eating. I panicked it would land on my food and tried not to think about how it probably was sitting on it in the kitchen anyway...sigh. I also took off one star because the beef on my vermicelli was half fat, half meat. After taking off the visible fat, there was only few pieces of real meat left. The flavors of pho broth was good. Crepe was excellent as well. The restaurant and the restrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Yum! We'll be back! Very large portions, reasonable prices and friendly service. They seem to do a good take-out business, too."}
{"text":"We have ordered food to pick up three times from here in the past month. I like the Pho Saigon Special with the sliced rare beef, beef tendon, briskiet, and meatball. It has a rich broth and very fresh vegetable ingredients and lime wedges with it. I especially like that they give you cilantro and very fresh bean sprouts. The coconut curry soup is one of my favorites, it has taro in it which makes it very satisfying with the chicken. The shaking beef is new for me and it has a lot of vegetables and is tender and nicely flavored. This place was a Streets of New York Pizza place for so long that it is odd to see a new restaurant in the corner spot of this Fry's shopping center."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the Pho Saigon Pearl and we weren't disappointed. My husband had the chicken pho and I had the vegetable pho. The broth was perfect and didn't require hoisin or Sriracha. The vegetables were fresh and crisp and just the right amount. We will definitely visit again!"}
