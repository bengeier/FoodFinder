{"text":"This place is great! The Wednesday night shows are the best in town, and get pretty naughty ;)"}
{"text":"The Sunday brunch has always been top notch with its previous management, Friends, and continues to delight the taste buds of the now Zorfs customers.  Last Sunday was sliced beef, sliced lamb, fried catfish, delicious vegetables, mashed sweet potatoes, along with the breakfast staples of bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, fresh fruit, waffles, and then the ultimate desserts.  I can't believe all of this is for only $12.50.  Hmmmm, see if you can even approach this at the McDonalds just down the road at this price!  Great food, Great waiters, Great environment, Great price, and a great place!   Zorfs is the best!"}
{"text":"Zorfs is pretty awesome. Kenny the owner has really turned this place around over the last year since he took it over about a year ago. The patio is an awesome addition! And now they have a good size dance floor.  Phoenix's only pet friendly LGBT bar, have been here when people have their dogs and they play around in the grassy area out by the patio.  Wednesday nights are game night, and they give away a lot of cool gifts. Highly recommended neighborhood bar if you like to chill and meet new great people."}
{"text":"This is like a gay dive bar...I wasn't sure if I was going to get knifed or not. They were holding a poker tournament so it brought in all sorts of characters. In also reeked of vomit inside. However, their outdoor patio was adorable!!"}
{"text":"When i went to the web site, i see a photo of an empty patio... that not really a selling feature, i hung out on the patio all night with a group of friends, the patio has this really weird giant tiki umbrella thats way to low, it either gets in your face or you can see across the patio. (we were all making jokes about how long it would take until someone sets it in fire)   The drinks were cheap so that was a plus.. and the bartenders were friendly even if he didn't know know to make the cocktail i ordered.   Not a visually appealing bar,  lots of wires all over the place, but its not a horrid place to get cocktails."}
{"text":"A comfortable place.  They are really working to make it something special., and even willing to listen to input. The new patio is a great addition.  Some people will like some nights and events better than others of course, but it is a place to put on your \"to go to\" list.   And bring your dog."}
