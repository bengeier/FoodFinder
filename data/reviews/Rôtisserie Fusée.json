{"text":"I come here with my kids all the time. They love it, it's better quality than St-Hubert chicken, and it's simple. I would like to see smaller portions for the kids."}
{"text":"What more can I say about this place that hasn't been said in my review for the train station fusse downtown Montreal.  Their chicken is literally sent from the heavens down to earth for us to enjoy.  This chicken is the most succulent roasted chicken I've had and it's probably the most inexpensive.  Their combos will surely fill you up as they come with fries, gravy, coleslaw and a bread bun!  I always come here when I'm in the area and literally ordered their take out once a week when I'm in Montreal.  The service is streamlined and extremely fast and I never wait long for my take out meals.  Overall the besy roasted chicken in Montreal at the best prices as well.  Be sure to try their roasted hot chicken sandwich as well covered in gravy and green peas.  It will make you pass out of a food coma guaranteed!"}
{"text":"A solid bet when in the area, also (without doubt) the cheapest bite in Outremont, they have some good specials that are well priced and a nice selection of chicken dishes.  In my opinion, the chicken is more consistently good than at St-Hubert, the sauce is a bit too mushy with no BBQ bite, the fries are just ok. But at 6 or 7 bucks, it's well worth it.  The location is a semi basement, a bit small but there is a tiny terrace for summer.  They offer delivery and take out is a good option,the many parks nearby being a great place to enjoy the food."}
{"text":"La terrasse est sympatique et le service rapide. Une bonne alternative Ã  St-Hubert."}
