{"text":"Awesome.  Something close by as the office building doesn't have a cafeteria.  The sandwich are delicious and great coffee.   Cozy warm place which will be my go to place for winter.   Like the fact it's not a complicated menu and the food is fresh.    Staff very pleasant and service with a smile.  Try it.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bunch of Sourdough breads. Get some. Kamut Spelt Millet Whole Wheat Walnuts, Dates  Organic.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"I loved this place, it felt like real food. As a veg guy, I appreciated hearty salads like the potato and couscous and the crusty bread was likely made in house :) Everything was delicious and I didn't have to struggle for good non-meat options."}
{"text":"Awesome bakery.  Excellent croissants.  Nice  little spot to drop in."}
{"text":"Lots of wonderful bread and muffins and what is commonly referred to as \"vienoisseries\". I came upon this gem while taking an exploratory stroll after shopping at the market nearby,wonderful surprise! Bought an orange/hazelnut bread for my breakfasts,can't wait to try it. Another great find and most likely,keeper."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars. A wonderful Boulangerie / Vienoisserie on the corner of Boyer and Bélanger. Highlights include their breads and mushroom quiche. (Not the best bread I've ever had, but very good, 4 of 5 proverbial stars.) They have a more limited selection of pastries, most of which have not disappointed-- really tasty eclairs. Reasonable prices. Everyone who works there is quite nice and helpful. It's pleasant to sit in their well-lit cafe tables by the window. No wifi-- and perhaps better this way."}
{"text":"Just delightful.  I was an American tourist staying at a nearby Airbnb and walked to this boulangerie every morning for coffee and treats for the fam.  The staff were welcoming and accommodating of my attempts at the French language.  The coffee was decent, and the croissants were to die for.  If I had been on a different kind of trip, or were a local, I'd have sat down inside and enjoyed my coffee and breakfast there every day."}
{"text":"Really cute coffee shop. I have yet to try the espresso, but the coffee is good and strong. I think it aims to be more of a sit-down cafe/bakery (lack of on-the-go essentials such as trays and cup covers). All sorts of healthy food options (gluten-free, healthy grains...). Muffins are great and hearthy. Free wifi (password is written on the black board near the entrance)."}
{"text":"La Miche Dorée désert une portion où il y a peu de boulanger. Ils faut allé sur Beaubien ou dans un marché local dans le coin pour avoir du bon pain ou des viennoiseries. J'y suis allé pour me chercher du pain, c'est pas trop dispendieux. Ils étaients occupés par une foule du midi qui manges sandwich et café. J'ai pris une miche, amandine et pain brioché. Très bien!"}
{"text":"This adorable little bakery café with friendly staff and lots of room to tuck in with a cup of my new favorite tea brand, 4 O'clock, was an ideal place to write near Old Montréal. The baked goods looked and smelled like heaven, but I didn't have a sweet tooth. I found the seating very comfortable and the atmosphere welcoming here. Free and easy wifi."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place you go because it's there when you're hungry and you don't really feel like walking any further. It's food. Sometimes, that's good enough.   I can't speak for everything on the menu, but the sandwiches/salads are some of the food that they serve. The sandwiches are the type where the bread gets toasted in a way that it kind of cuts the roof of your mouth. The salads are vegetables, starches, or the occasional mix of both. Neither had much flavour, but it will fill your food hole enough to leave you not that hungry."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in two days so I guess you could say I like this café. The vibe here is great. It is quirky and fun in a not \"try hard\" kind of way. There is a small indoor area and a cute outdoor section. The construction kind of takes away from the tranquility but I still enjoyed studying outside the café with my food and much needed caffeine.  Conveniently located, near the Nouveau CHUM and Champ-de-Mars metro, it is a perfect place to grab a bite. They offer a 5% discount for CHUM employees which isn't much but is a nice recognition for those who work there. The staff here are very friendly and welcoming.  The first time I came, I ordered a croissant sandwich with ham and brie. It was delicious. I ordered a plain coffee but wanted to try one of their many coffee creations.  Today, I couldn't help but order the same sandwich. What can I say? I am a creature of habit.  The only downside is the business hours. It closed at 4:00pm on Wednesday and I'm pretty sure it is the same everyday. This is quiet inconvenient. Anyhow, I look forward to coming back here when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Nouvelle boulangerie/café depuis mars, juste en face du nouveau CHUM, ils ont sandwichs/salades/viennoiseries et café parfait pour le lunch. Personel sympa. Wifi gratuit + cartes de crédit acceptées. *Très achalandé durant le midi.  4/5 visité en avril 2015"}
{"text":"La plus belle machine de café et le meilleur café latté en ville ! Variété de Grilled Cheese pommes et brie sur pain aux noix miam miam!"}
{"text":"The quality of the ingredients they use is phenomenal, often organic and listed in store! The croissant and chocolatine are exquisite. The muffins are healthy and very filling. The breads are amazing too... my favourite is the tournesol (so so tasty) and the baguette rustique. The staff is always polite ans effective.  I would give it 5 stars for the quality of their product, but I cannot get over the attitude of the owner. For example, once I had been sitting less than a minute at a table waiting for my husband to order breakfast and he sent an employee over to tell me I had to leave unless I ordered. I had just sat down and the place was empty. On many other occasions I have noticed his arrogance towards myself or other customers... thankfully he is not there often, but it goes without saying that I would buy my bread there more often if it wasn't for that"}
{"text":"Belle boulangerie, plusieurs tables, juste au coin et à coté piste  cyclable donc facil de faire un petit stop sucré."}
