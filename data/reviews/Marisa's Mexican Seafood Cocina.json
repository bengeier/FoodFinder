{"text":"Excellent food! OMG! This is a fantastic place to eat! Great family restaurant. Nice people, nice atmosphere. Clean restrooms."}
{"text":"Best seafood in The Valley and the best group of people ready to serve you.  If you want quality food and good service and a remarkable shrimp cocktail come here and let them know that Paulo Ink sent you."}
{"text":"good food great customer service. Had a problem with my meal it was resolved quickly. Great michelada drinks ,  can get a little loud when music is blaring and Mariachi's are playing at the same time. I will be returning"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, yelp lead us in the wrong direction.  After craving shrimp cocktails, and trying this place with family out of town we had a horrible experience. The service was terrible. It took forever to order drinks since the waitress walked away before I could order, she came back and finally took out food orders and drink order. But walked away before we could finish. The food took forever to get and she never came back to check on us. We order tostadas de ceviche and had stale tostada shells and ended up using the chips. We had to get up and get our own checks. Once we finally received our check, we were charged a 18% percent gratuity when the service clearly much less. Overall not a place we will be going back to."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite place to eat!! The food here is amazing and they have live bands that play for u!! I'm really impressed with this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Good food but the service takes to long waited for one hour and half for food... and they serve half of the orders the other half  had to wait another 20min! Seriously and because my family is seven people they automatically charge the waiter tip 18%! I'll gladly pay it!! But if the food was serve in a timely manner!! Will not be back"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Love the food . its beyond great. And the service is outstanding. ....restaurant it self is lovely and most of all clean. I highly recommend everyone that is looking for some great and tasty seafood and dont forget other mexican dishes...come and visit, you wont regret it.! I promise."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and authentic food. I had the fish tacos (breaded) and they were massive and delicious. Great green rice and beans with cheese on top. Also nice coleslaw on the tacos!"}
{"text":"They have really good platters, also there ceviche is really good , the customer service was really good they were very attentive and made sure everything was good a little pricey then most mariscos places around the area but the service takes a win..."}
{"text":"First time here, my friends are regulars. The customer service was excellent and the food was delicious five stars on that alone. Unfortunately my friends did have a bad experience, with their food. But the problem was resolved by the owner, and for that I will not be taking any stars off. Highly recommended to everyone."}
{"text":"Had dinner here today for the first time and all I can say was that everything was very tasty. Starting with the salsa that was served with tostadas, it had a great flavor. We had shrimp tacos, bacon wrapped shrimp, shrimp cocktail and kids breaded fish with fries.... all the food was great. I would definitely recommend and will be returning very soon! They even have happy hour during the week :)"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a decent Mariscos place here in AZ.  I'm from SoCal so Mariscos is legit and in abundance.  Marisa's was pretty damn good.  It's hard to find a decent taco de marlin but this was pretty gotdamn good.  I didn't even want to eat my ceviche Marisa's..  ceviche Marisa's was pretty great too.  Overall.... bring yourself here and give your taste buds a pretty amazing treat."}
{"text":"Very very good food. Very fresh. Large menu of different dishes. Reasonably priced. You don't have to have seafood if you don't want to. They are extremely friendly. I went here with my gf, because I saw online that they received an A from the health dept. Lol I definitely recommend it. It's a great place to try something new. Only thing wrong was the music was a little bit to loud."}
{"text":"Great seafood!! Recommend this place to anyone! Great service and prices. Definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"Salsa and chips, awesome. Ordered the grilled red snapper in tinfoil, not the deep fried. So this take about 25-30 minutes to cook. Awesome. Really, really good. About 5-10% of it wasn't fully cooked so those parts, not so good but such a small thing compared to the huge dish you get. Just take a look at my pic."}
{"text":"I have 2 favorite restaurants and was kind of scared trying this one out. I sure gotta say this is a 5 star and over. The food was delicious and big servings so worth it. It will now be on my favorite on my list and I'm sure it will now be on top of my 2 favs. Delicious ."}
{"text":"The best Micheladas ever and caldos. Fresh made chips and Salsa. Friendly n very attentive staff."}
{"text":"My wife and I have had lots of good Mexican food and the frajitas and seafood were great. Not fancy by any means, but great happy hour, food, and friendly staff.  If you want fancy, not your place, but comfortable and good."}
{"text":"Food was good but I've been to better Mexican Seafood restaurants. Check El Marinero at San Antonio and you'll be able to compare."}
{"text":"Seriously devastated after going here.... High hopes crushed by salty food yet weak flavor food.  Seafood soup was so salty it was inedible, literally only ate the octopus and shrimp.   Steak fajitas had this odd almost artificial flavor, salty again and just not good.   Highlight of the meal was tamarind margaritas and chips/salsa.   Sorry Marisa we won't be back."}
{"text":"We were dropping off her kids at Grand Canyon University this week and yelped for a good Mexican restaurant locally. This had the best reviews so we came and it even exceeded our expectations. You have to try the mango margarita it is stellar. The tacos were good, everything fresh with oversized portions. I had a breaded calamari fillet with garlic butter and I wish I could drive back to Arizona from California just to eat it once a week. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tries them for the first time last week. Their $5.99 fish taco lunch special with Yelp check in definitely brought me in. I wasn't expecting much but im glad to report their fish tacos were awesome. The batter was flavorful and fish moist, quite a hard feat to accomplish with fish tacos now at days. Their rice is a little different, with more of a green sauce spin to it than your usual red rice. Came with beans which were just fine and freshly made tortilla chips. I will definitely be back to try the rest of their menu and go with more core seafood offerings they have"}
{"text":"HoooOOoOoOoooOLy Mariscos!!  I can honestly say I am so comfortably full and it was probs the best seafood I've had in a long time. Our girlfriend Genesis is allergic to shellfish so we asked if they could make a separate ceviche de pescado for her and they did!! The waitress we had made sure to tell them to not let shellfish touch ANYTHING on that ceviche and it was sooooo fresh!!! I ordered the cóctel de ceviche de camarón and it was so well seasoned and flavored. Tiffany got La Torre China and said the octopus was so fresh. It's a little far than our usual areas of hangs but it was SO worth it. I had to write a review. We will be back!! Thanks for the yummy dinner!!"}
{"text":"This place is really good.  Loraine one of the waitresses is really superb.  We keep coming back and it's always good.  We're (wife and I) especially fond of the marisa's sauce.  Don't even know what the other sauces taste like.   Pros:  friendly, efficient staff.           very good food-we're especially fond of the shrimp tacos and the shrimp enchiladas and the shrimp burito.           nice décor con's: There's always a Tv going but it's not loud. Sometimes there's Spanish music playing which can on occasion be too loud.  It's ok for one or two but with a group it's hard to hear each other.  We really enjoy Loraine and we really enjoy the food.  We'll keep coming back...and back...and back.  You will too."}
{"text":"I'm not a seafood lover. But Marisa's has changed that! I love love love there fish tacos, ceviche, and I even tried the oyster shooters. That was the best but that's just me. My kids have had the quesadilla and love it! I've never been disappointed"}
{"text":"Great food, horrible wait time and service. We waited over 45 minutes for our food and it was just two of us. Our server never came in to check on us. Better off ordering to go."}
{"text":"We wanted to go somewhere that had authentic Mexican seafood. This place is the spot!!. Not only was the atmosphere absolutely wonderful. The staff was extremely polite and patient (especially for those that don't speak Spanish). The food was absolutely amazing everything we had was so fresh and delightful.  We will for sure be returning very shortly to try new food items."}
{"text":"A+. Ceviche and spicy tacos were great. Clean place and good service. Heads up: Marisa's burrito sauce is cream-based and definitely a very \"creative\" interpretation of Mexican food."}
{"text":"First time here. Recommended by a coworker. Aguachile was tasty wish portion was bigger. Molcajete mixto was delicious. Kids had steak strips with fries and rice. Family of 5. $85.00 not bad. Cucumber mineral water was awesome and refreshing. Service was great. Will be back."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood around 4:00 PM and stopped in to give it a try.  Food was delicious - very authentic and tasty.  The Governor taco is quite good!  Shrimp quesadilla, while simple, was great.  Not many diners in at this time of day, so the music could be a little less loud.  Good music that fits the theme, but probably sounds better when there are more people in the dining room.  Service was great - very friendly waitress who cared about my experience as a customer!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. We tried a little of everything, had to come back twice it was so good. Liked the decor, everything was clean."}
{"text":"Legit Mexican food. Good clean restaurant and good atmosphere. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm really late in writing this review, but that is no indication of the quality of food. Went to this place on a whim - my brother was in town and wanted something light, but still with a southwest flair. This fit the bill very well!  The ambiance is very southwest without being kitschy. White walls, dark beams, saltillo tile floors, a wandering mariachi band, great mexican and southwest decor items. There are menus in both english and spanish. Beers are served cold in a tin bucket with ice!  Our waitress was very nice and extremely patient - she did not speak a lot of english and spoke even less spanish! Thankfully my brother is fluent in spanish and saved the day - otherwise I have no idea what I would have ordered.   I had the shrimp and crab enchiladas - they were sublime. Flavors were good and the sauce complimented (not overpowered) the seafood. My brother had the shrimp diablo - it looked delicious and fiery! Chips and salsas were fresh and plentiful.   I saw other tables ordering the ceviches - they looked amazing (but I am just not a fan, personal preference).   It was a really enjoyable experience and I would recommend this restaurant if you are looking for tasty mexican food that is an introduction to the coastal part of mexican fare."}
{"text":"I had costa Azul bacon wrapped shrimp  and my husband had 7 mares and a michelada, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Can I just start by start by saying I am so happy I found this place! I just moved from CA and have been looking for a good seafood place and im 100% sure this is my new spot. The girls that work there are super friendly, great customer service, and there is live music playing some nights. The fish tacos are delicious the aguachiles are to die for! This is a place everybody should check out for sure."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out late on a Saturday night. I was surprised it was so dead. We were the only ones there. No one was at the door to greet us. Three minutes later after making noise, a tastefully provocatively dress young nice lady came to greet us. I ordered the ceviche aguachile. It was a huge portion. The price was right. I thought it good. My husband had the Cameron al mojo de ajo. He thought the food was bland nothing too special about it. The menus were also all in Spanish no English translations whatsoever. I doubt I'll ever go back since there are many other places I must try. Oh but the place was really clean."}
{"text":"We came up to this restaurant on our way to the Grand Canyon. Mini vacay with my family. Wow!! My first thought was... Love the decor!! Everything on the menu looks super good... We ordered fish tacos, ceviche tostadas, grilled fish with the specialty \"marisa's sauce\". Let me just say...omg!! Everything was DELICIOUS!!! After speaking with the owner, Marisa, great lady!! she mentioned she just open her restaurant a few months ago. Go try her dishes, I recommend it"}
{"text":"First time visit and got food to go. The camarones cucaracha were awesome, crunchy but still juicy on the inside. Shrimp and octopus cocktail was delish, fresh and flavorful. Appreciate the fact that they still gave me chips and salsa even though it was a to go order since the majority of places won't include them. Staff was friendly, place was clean and welcoming ambiance. Can't wait to come back and eat here, hopefully the won't be out of callos. Also hope they get a Web page or something where one can look at the menu especially since they didn't have to go menus either."}
{"text":"3 years later and still going strong.  Just ate there for my dads birthday. Menu has been updated and is still delicious. Get the Bandera for a sample of 3 different ceviches!"}
{"text":"Good. Not great, but good. I would go back. Food was good for the price paid. Service was also good. Ceviche was mainly cooked shrimp chopped up with a hint of tomato and what looked like cucumber and onion. Used to ceviche with the shrimp cooked in lime, and chunks of avocado, tomato, onion, etc. This was mainly lime/shrimp on a tostada. Tasted fine. Soda was flat. Chips and salsa good."}
{"text":"Over priced! We ate dinner there when they first open and it's nothing special. My wife order enchiladas with chicken and the tortilla where hard. I don't like the rice and will not return."}
{"text":"Really cute restaurant specializes in Sea Food but has a great menu and lots of other options.  I had the carne asada tacos very tasty.  And a Virgin Mango Margarita very tasty  The waitress was so delightful and very accommodating. I also enjoyed the ambience loved the music that they were playing.  Ahua!  Muy Sabrosa comida."}
{"text":"The ceviche is kind of pricy and don't even think about asking for octopus unless you want to double your tab. But the ceviche portion is the largest I've ever gotten from any place. I've spent more at other places for a whole lot less. Very tasty ceviche, just wish they gave you more than three tostadas. I'm still not complaining. I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for lunch. We were seated right away and the service was pretty decent. I'm not an expert on seafood by any means, but I did grow up in Cali and we crossed the boarder quit a bit for mariscos.   The food was just okay. Nothing we ordered really stood out as fantastic. Although a friend of mine ordered the Molcajete, now that was tasty.   Also, we did have a couple of banda trios stop by our table to convince us to have them play a song, but that was a big fat negative. In fact no one in the restaurant bought a song. Not sure I'd come here again. I'd rather check out the neighboring restaurants to see how they fare before I return."}
{"text":"Great Food !! Awesome Ceviche.. Not like some places where shrimps were too small and all juice!! Their Ceviche was the BEST!! Patty ( Patrica ) was very friendly and attentive!! We would definitely go back. Guacamole was very fresh and good. Great great place!!"}
{"text":"Solid Mexican fare.  Nothing fancy.  Clean with excellent food and great margaritas.  I highly recommend this restaurant. Staff was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Great food!  Had the shrimp ceviche inside an avacado.  Then had the fish with Alfredo sauce - outstanding.   Would come back."}
{"text":"We were in town on business and our nephew goes to school in Phoenix so we picked him up and headed for some Mexican. It was well worth the trip. The food was really good and the staff was super nice. The margaritas were well made and it was a great experience."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and always drive by this place thinking maybe someday we'll try it out.... but we never did..... until last night!!! We came late, they close at 10 and we got there at 930 and they were totally cool with us. Just me my girl and our son and noone else in the whole place. We were greeted by Marisa and sat at a comfortable booth. We ordered the kids carne asada strips, lg shrimp cocktail, and the mix fajitas which has shrimp, carne, and chicken. The food was AWESOME!!! My shrimp cocktail was full of shrimp and it was perfectly seasoned and flavored, it had just the right amount of spice but still was very refreshing. My only complaint with the shrimp cocktail and for me personally it's a small one is the fact that they do not devein the  shrimp in the cocktail. Not that big a deal but it's a nice Personal Touch whenever I see it. My girlfriend's fajitas we're also amazing! The portion was more than the average person should eat which is a good thing and the flavor was spot-on. Everything tasted fresh , the shrimp in the fajitas were deveined and they were jumbo-sized and the rice and beans were some of the best I've ever had. Don't be fooled by the green rice it may look odd but its taste delicious. My son's kids meal was good for the price. I would have appreciated a few more steak strips and a few less fries but I guess that's what a kids meal is for. All in all it was a great experience especially at the end of the night. The staff was very friendly and the food was very good,we will definitely be going back and soon. I rated 4 stars but this place is like 4.75 stars. I hope they bring their a-game on the next visit too because i really liked this place. DEFINITELY WILL RECOMMEND THIS TO A FRIEND!"}
{"text":"We finally found a Mexican seafood restaurant with delicious and fresh seafood. We began by sharing a large and very flavorful tostada de jaiba (crab) appetizer with an ice cold bottle of Dos Aquis lager. I ordered the Camarones (shrimp) Azul wrapped in a delicious crisp bacon and served with two sauces on the side-creamy chipotle and green cilantro. My wife had a shrimp molcahete with Marisa's creamy and delicious sauce with sautéed onions and rajas. The beans and rice with cilantro were wonderful as were both the flour and corn tortillas. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Two stars because the service was great. Our waitress was very nice and kept passing by our table. But.... the food was not good. I had the ceviche de aguachile verde and it didn't seem traditional. I mean it didn't even have tomato like ceviche is supposed to. Didn't care for this place"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Good food, good service, good price.  The best seafood in town. WE WILL BE BACK"}
{"text":"Awesome seafood....I loved the spicy octopus taco, coconut shrimp, fried fish and agua chiles.... The mango margaritas are very tasty and a must to try... Wonderful customer service!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Was in the mood for something fresh this was just the place. They had different varieties of ceviche . The waitress was helpful in making a decision on which one to choose. She also made sure to give us enough time to choose our drinks and dishes. We got the red snapper which was perfectly cook not oily at all the skin was crispy and the meat was flaky. The atmosphere was relaxing and there was musicians playing songs if you wanted one. The place was nice and clean and the bathroom was spacious and clean. And the portions were pretty big good for sharing.  This reminded me of my time in Mexico sitting on the beach and getting some food. Al that was missing was the sand and the ocean ."}
