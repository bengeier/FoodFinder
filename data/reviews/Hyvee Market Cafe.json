{"text":"Front end staff and managers NOT friendly. We stopped by for a few items! No smiles even after smiling at them!I'll probably be going to Copps from now on"}

{"text":"What a great place for a salad! Plenty to choose from, & you can pile a ton on your plate for a one time go through. It's $5.99 a plate, $2 more for all you can eat! They also have a place to sit, be waited on & get drinks.  Next to their salad bar is an olive & Buffalo wings bat that also includes boneless wings. Quick, easy, with a lot of variety. Way to go Hy-Vee!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible and unattentive. Restaurant 1/2 empty and took 40 min to be seated, then 40 min more to get a waitress over. Then another 40 for the food to come. Not worth it .. could have gone across the street and been done by now."}
{"text":"After my first dining option didn't pan out, I dropped by the Hyvee Market Café to grab a meal to go while running lunch time errands on the west side of town.  In the aftermath of my Market Café dining disaster, I wished I had never stopped at all.  Before I get into the gory details of my meal, I'll share some positive observations: * While I primarily think of Hy-Vee as a grocery store, the Westgate location houses a fully functional sit down restaurant, complete with full bar service.  Patrons also had the option of serving themselves from the massive Grand Buffet or ordering off the menu.  While the interior décor is rather generic, the was clean and well maintained with a bevy of flat screens to keep the customer entertained. * All the staff members I interacted with were super friendly.  Based on the enthusiastic recommendation of the host, I had the misfortune of ordering the Cajun Shrimp.  To this day, I can not fathom how this train wreck of a meal left the kitchen.  It looked terrible and tasted worse.  Here is a multitude of sin that made this dish the most disgusting thing I ate so far this year (check out my pictures - I am not making this up): * The over-cooked shrimp was rubbery * The dish swam in a puddle of grease * The combination of white and wild rice, was extremely mushy from being overcooked and soaking in the aforementioned puddle of grease * The overuse of the Cajun spice mix added a graininess to all the ingredients and made the dish almost too spicy to consume * The grease-soaked lemon slices imparted a bitter flavor note  Scarred from this traumatic experience, I will never return, there are so many other better options in Madison.  UPDATE #1:  About an hour after I posted my review, I was contacted by Hy-Vee customer service, who indicated they were investigating the matter.  Several hours after that, I received a phone call from the store manager apologizing for the quality of the dish.  Based on the their prompt follow-up, I'm backing off my \"never again\" stance.  Color me impressed by their since response.  I'll update my review based on my future interactions."}

Plus they have daily happy hour deals on alcohol and discounted appetizers, and their service is a delightful and welcome surprise."}
