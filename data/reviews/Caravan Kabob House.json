{"text":"I am a member of La fitness and decided to try this place, and wow! I was impressed. the food is always freshly prepared and perfectly seasoned. I have tried most of the kebobs on the menu and all have been impressive, they will adjust the heat and toppings  to your liking. The owner remembers my name after a couple visits and has offered freebies regularly. Sorry to hear about the less than stellar review above, I would be surprised if it were not addressed. One small negative the serving staff are a little inexperienced but are very very pleasant. all in all a great place"}
{"text":"Our new favorite Afghan spot in Brampton now that Eggs and Kebab shut down but good news is the head chef from Eggs and Kebab is now at Caravan. 
Food is amazing and servings are huge. Decor is very nice with lots of room to sit even for large groups. They also have a patio for warmer weather.

Loose 1 star for lack of cleaning up tables after people leave. They actually have sign to not clear the tables and seems like the responsibility falls on the cashier who even when not busy. i have been here when we have been the only ones in the restaurant and tables around us have remained uncleaned while we dined. 

I would still go back. Food is amazing. Spicy tandoori chicken is really good"}
{"text":"Really good food and reasonable prices. We had the kofta dinner and chicken with salad and naan bread. Really good portions and food was well presented."}
{"text":"When to grab lunch during my lunch break. ......took 25 mins to get the meal. I only have 30 mins break....so disappointed. Lady at the front is so rude. Bad customer service."}
{"text":"Chaplee kebab is good and nice. Nice friendly people. Only bit pricey. Tried chicken stew burger all good."}
{"text":"If your hungry don't come here. Waited over 30 mins for my food and the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"The decorations were really good and the food was okay, but they lacked employees because they took awhile to clean up a table for us to sit in. Other than that it was very impressive."}
{"text":"First time eating at the Caravan Kabob House. We were extremely impressed with the quality of the food. The meat was seasoned to perfection and exploded with flavour. The quantity received for the price was incredible. To top it off, the dining room decor was modern and very inviting.

Just moved to Brampton from Burlington and can honestly say we've found our newest favourite restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, these guys are not just great because of their great food but also because of their great attitude. Must Visit for Afghani Kabab/couisine Lovers."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3 stars on an overall bases when comparing to other Afgan place in the Mississauga.

First impression when getting in... Quite nice, clean and very different decor and Beautiful sit in restaurant then other Afgan places mostly. Take a menu and have a seat, once decided you will have to order and pay for it at the till and wait for the food. 

Food wise the price is higher and portion size similar to other place for dishes with 2 kabaabs. The naan is very small but they do make that fresh. The menu is similar to other Afgan place but I found a lot of items missing. 

Our order included Multiple Kababs and half a chicken. The half a chicken is not cut into piece and comes as a whole. The food was hot, rice was cooked nice and meat was well seasoned, juicy and tender.

The service was ok. There is enough seating and Parking.

For my Muslim bro and sis - They serve Halal meat and state it on their site as well."}
{"text":"I went to caravan with a few of my friends yesterday.
They have a very nice extensive menu. We ordered, Chaplin kabob dinner enough to feed two adults for lunch and the half chicken dinner.  That was extremely flavourful and a huge portion.  We loved the food. Place was big with lots of seating.  Good fast service.  We will be going back again."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this spot. Loved everything but the chaplee kabob which seemed pre cooked and very dry. To be honest I couldn't really taste the meat. Everything else was good though."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's right by an LA Fitness I frequent, so it's a popular destination for my post-workout meal. I like that it's open until 11 during the week, though there's not many people there at the time. 

Food is pretty good. I have had the salmon and the lamb. Meat is well cooked, and they are decent with their portion sizes. However, I do believe that they could charge a little less for what they're giving. 

Most dishes you will get here are over 12$, so if you are looking for something cheap you may be better off somewhere else."}
{"text":"Found out about this place after seeing their logo and advertising around the Powerade Centre for years when going to see the Brampton Beast play. Was in the area for a meeting and made a point of finding it. 

Admittedly, GPS will take you on a wild goose chase so just make way for the Talize thrift shop and it's a few doors down (behind the Home Depot off of Steeles Ave). 

While the plaza seems to be caught in a downward spiral, Caravan is thriving! A massive casual dining experience where orders are taken at the front counter and brought to your table when ready. 

The menu is massive with a variety of middle eastern, traditional afghani specialties and some fusion picks (western and even Indian inspired fusion). 

The order process was a bit haphazard with a decorative median divides incoming customers to two sides of the cash and people are standing around asking if you've ordered or if you're waiting for your food. A little disjointed, but the job got done. 

I went with the chicken and kofta dinner which comes with 2 meat skewers, salad, an Afghan style naan (smaller and fluffier than traditional Indian naan) and enough rice to feed a family of four!

The meal took a good 20 minutes to be ready which is both good and bad. Good in that you know it's being prepared to order, but bad because the fast/casual set up gives the impression that it might be faster. When it arrived though it was totally worth it. Moist well spiced kebabs, fluffy naan, nice fresh salad and again more rice than you could hope to eat in 3 meals. 

Overall a good experience. I'd definitely come back again

{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW 3 stars

Had another takeout order recently, everything was good, the chicken was super flavorful, the beef was decent, the bread was fresh, the salad was good. Much better than last time.

Service (for takeout anyway) is still unfriendly, they stand behind the counter not acknowledging you, and are no help at all for explaining what's on the menu. Even when you're the only customer there.

----------------------------------------
ORIGINAL REVIEW 2 stars

This place needs to hire new staff, how is it possible to be the only customer in there ordering something, and they forget to start cooking your order? What should have taken ten minutes, instead took forty minutes.

The beef tika was overcooked, and under-seasoned.

The salads weren't really salads, they were just chopped up vegetables with no dressing or flavour.

The tandoori chicken was delicious, which earns them a second star in my rating.

The naan is a bit of a mystery. Out of four pieces, one of them was soft and very fresh like it was just made. One was hard and kind of stale. The other two were too hard to eat, like they had been sitting in the kitchen for a few days."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great portions and reasonably priced. The rice is flavourful, the pita is warm and puffy, the meat pieces are tender and juicy and the fries are super crispy. This has become a go-to takeout spot and it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"My husband and I thought that this place was fantastic. The staff here were very friendly. They gave recommendations that were delicious. They even gave us a yummy free dessert. The price wasn't terrible either. We would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The naan bread was so soft and fluffy which made me really happy, I hate getting burnt naan. I had the tandoori dinner, and everything was really good. The restaurant has a nice layout that can accommodate to bigger groups, and it has a nice cozy feel. Since the food was good, service was good, I definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This place had delicious food but this time I think I must have gone during a super busy rush-hour where they had errors with other people's food. All the food was delayed and we sat waiting for quite a while we got our food and then towards the end I realized we still haven't gotten our fries so I went and asked about them twice and then they finally came out. They were nice enough to give everyone free dessert but that was not even super spectacular. I think I would go back but I would hope the service would be better this time and it wouldn't take this long to get food. I have the wrap with chicken and it was good"}
{"text":"OMG!!! THIS IS THE BEST AFGHAN FOOD EVER!!!
The portions are Huge! The store was clean and looked very EXPENSIVE to construct!! There seemed to be on the short side when it comes to waitresses because our table got cleaned 10min after we sat down"}
{"text":"This place is now part of our regular work lunch rotation as it's close to the office. I've had the beef, chicken and lamb here and all were good; well seasoned and cooked well. Like Bamiyan Kabob, the portions here are massive. Decor is nice and there is ample seating and can accommodate large groups (we have a team of 13 guys). I did find it was very cold here in the winter and kept my jacket on while eating."}
{"text":"Drove by this place many times so I finally thought why not try it right !?!??
Well I'm
Happy I did as it is pretty good .
Meat was tasty and fresh they give you an option of with right and salad or just salad to keep your carb intake  down which is nice lol 
Prices are fair so it seemed !
I would definitely come back !"}
{"text":"My go-to food spot in Brampton! I love Caravan Kabob's chicken kabob. The seasoning is sublime. The Afghan bread is warm, fresh, and delicious with the chili dip. My family goes here all the time for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Caravan Kabob House straight up ripped me off.  Forgot a large portion of our take out meal, then they did not return phone calls which we made as soon as we got home.  Left messages on their voicemail and not even a courtesy call back.

I went in there for a take out order when they were admittedly very busy.  My order was two Wazeri Kabob dinners which are supposed to be a skewer of both chicken and beef.  Dinners come with their own portion of rice, a salad, and a naan bread

When I got home with my takeout order, they COMPLETELY forgot the beef skewers on both meals, and for some bizarre reason the chicken kebabs were in empty styrofoam boxes with nothing else in them?  WTF?  As if I asked for the meat on the side or something?  They completely forgot one of the two salads as well.  And while I asked for one of the salads to be \"lettuce only\" (picky dining companion), the ONLY salad we received was a small container of lettuce with no salad dressing.  The naan breads were literally blackened and bitter on the edges, making them completely inedible as well.

As I mentioned, as soon as we got home, frustrated as hell when so many things were messed up, we called the number on our receipt which they didn't answer ALL night.  Wife left a message on their voicemail politely explaining our order was forgotten, and not even a courtesy response

If anyone from Caravan ever reads this and actually cares, then send me a message and I will re-evaluate, but I'm not optimistic after all of this.

{"text":"Coles notes review: good food, ridiculous wait times. I'm not a 100% if worth it. 

Good ambiance, music. Staff generally quite nice and helpful. The front desk staff sadly have no control as it's the kitchen that lets them down. 

Food. It's been 33 min I'm still waiting for my to go order. I've been to homedepot. Shopped. Chatted. Came back and am now waiting. 

Update. 38 min later, I have my order. I was told 20 min when I'd placed it. Seems the norm here. Same happened last couples times prior. The irony is that it doesn't have to be only when the place is busy. Even with just a few customers, the wait times are the same atrocious amount. 

The naans are excellent. The kabobs quite nice with good flavour as long as they are eaten quite quickly after being served. The keema again flavourful. The chicken stew with okra. The last two though..so much oil. I think could make an extra two curries with the left oil in the two small dishes take away. 

5 min +- no issues. At nearly double the estimated wait time, my ocd on time kicks in and it's unacceptable. 

So to reiterate, decent food, be prepared to wait. And wait. Then wait some more."}
{"text":"Food, really poor quality. Not what I expected when going to a retail that is supposed to serve traditional (Greater Iranian food) Afghan, Tajik food etc. The flavours not that great. The koobideh was dry and hard. It's supposed to be tender but it was too dry unfortunately. The price was way overboard. I would highly suggest Mazar Kabob for anyone looking to eat Eastern Iranian food (Tajik, Afghan) ."}
{"text":"I decided to have dinner here cause it's close to where I live & wanted to give it a try. I had the Chicken Kabob meal (inc Salad). I was a little disappointed. The meal was good but not great. The Naan was almost burnt & very hard to chew. Although the cashier was polite when I complained about the Naan they did nothing. The restaurant was clean & appeared well cared for but this is not a do-over!"}
{"text":"So many tasty dishes to choose from (took me about 5 minutes to decide) but I went with the lamb (chopan) dinner.  My wife had chicken.  Both were delicious.
Nothing fancy  -- a menu board restaurant in a strip mall, but pleasantly spiced food and lots of it (I've never seen so much rice in my life)."}
{"text":"Used to or rather 'had' to drive over 60kms, all the way to Scarborough for kebabs but no more! Plus found what we've been looking for in particular too. Was so happy that ended up paying a tip for self service. Sheesh! Kebab! Yep!

Plenty of parking on a weekend night. So that's a plus in my books. Clean, spacious and neutral smelling interior. Whoa! Things looking good here. 

So we ordered a value platter and what we had been searching for all this time, Chicken Chaplee Kebab dinner. If you paid attention to how this review started, you can imagine this movie had a happy ending folks.

Everything and by that I mean every, single, soft, juicy, tender and aromatic piece of kebab was flawless. Chicken Chaplee kebabs were a bit on the mild side but fret not, they weren't bad at all. We were also able to substitute chicken instead of beef. Naans were fresh, warm and soft. Salad was crisp. 

Ended the feast with what my friend called Firni. Milky gelly with mesmerizing, cold and not too sweet aftertaste. A good end to a fabulous weekend!"}
{"text":"This place has some REALLY bad reviews and I hope I don't get food poisoning like the other reviewer but honestly I like this place!

Caravan came to la fitness with samples offering a 15 (I thought I heard 50) percent discount to anyone who has a la fitness membership. Because I originally heard 50 I had plans to eventually check it out. Today after the gym I was so hungry I decided to walk over.

I was surprised at how nice the decor was on the inside. Looks very modern and clean. The girl behind cash was very friendly and recommended the tadoori chicken since I like spice. On my way home I kept getting a whiff of my food from the paper bag. I could not wait to get home because it smelled so good. 

The chicken had a good flavour, not spicy but I enjoyed it. I think one of the pieces was a bit undercooked so I didn't eat it. The salad was perfect, topped with tomatoes and fresh herbs. The nan bread was nice and fluffy, thicker than traditional nan bread that you get from an Indian restaurant but good none the less. The rice was so flavourful I need to know what they used to season it because I could eat it alone (I love rice). Overall I was very impressed by the flavour combinations and portion size. I only ate half my food and there's enough left for lunch tomorrow. As long as I don't get food poisoning I will definitely be back.

Keep on mind they are a new establishment and they are probably still working out the kinks, so hopefully the next couple reviews are better ones."}
{"text":"An order-at-counter type of sit down restaurant that is a local favourite for my family and I. 

We have eaten here many times since it's opening a few years back and have enjoyed every meal (tho some were better than others). 

Prices have increased quite a bit and I do remember them putting out a notice for their first or largest increase for customers dining at the restaurant. That being said a dinner upgraded to a Kubile (additional topping of carrots and raisins on the rice) costs around $20 with tax. This plate was piled with steaming rice, a fresh salad, juicy meat and served with a warm and fluffy naan. By all means it was worth the money spent according to its quality AND quantity. 
**see photo**
(There was plenty of the Kubile topping it's just hidden under the meat!) 

This may have been the most expensive dinner I have had here but I can definitely say it was the best one yet!"}
