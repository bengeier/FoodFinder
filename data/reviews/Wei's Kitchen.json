{"text":"Amazing affordable food - soup and dessert is always delicious, great for takeout because the seating is a bit crowded."}
{"text":"The food was nasty. We ordered some pretty basic things, wonton noodle soup and stir fried noodles. The wontons had so much flour inside and just tasted gross. The stir fried noodles were a bit better but no appetizing at all."}
{"text":"A tiny little restaurant in First Markham Place that focuses on a home cooking style. With a bit of a Hakka style, you get a sense of mother's cooking here. 

One of my favourites is definitely Pork Belly and Pepper Soup, as it warms you up and gets you ready for the meal. Another favourite is the Duck and Taro Pot, with rich flavour and a wonderful texture. 

A very small restaurant, as I've said, so you almost 'always' have to wait for a table. They do take reservations, so you could always call ahead. However, it does get really warm in the summer, as there are lots of people in the space, and not the best AC. 

All in all, a cool place to try something a little different. Service is great, as the servers are nice, and try to accommodate even when super busy!"}
{"text":"This is a Cantonese restaurant, not a fancy one but not bad in terms of quality of food.  My friend told me that the soup is what its famous for.  I just feel the price of some of the food was a bit too high or in other words the portion was too small.  I would come back again though if I am in the around."}
{"text":"We did not expect an authentic Cantonese home style restaurant here! It is the style in GuangZhou or Zhongshan, or Hong Kong style. It is hard to articulate the difference but it is the home style in GuangZhou. Everything tastes good! (Expect the shrimp. Feels like they were just taken out from the freezer...so 3 stars instead of 4)"}
{"text":"Wei's is a pretty average place at FMP.  I ordered a stirred fried noodle.  The portion was big.  The price was at par with other places at FMP.  The noodle tasted bland but it could be just me, cause I eat salty.  I added chili sauce to spice it up.  I packed half home as dinner."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but Service and temperature in the restaurant is horrendous. It is extremely hot and I'm not sure why they can't lower the temperature a little bit more. The food is extremely good and is a for sure come again. But the comfort level in this restaurant is a problem. Started eating into 2 minutes and sweat already dripping...Service is decent but have difficulty understanding English which is understandable. Overall decent restaurant, just fix on the temperature issue."}
{"text":"We ordered the rice roll with dough stick and beef rice roll and thought it was pretty good. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"4 star for excellent double boil soup. Takes about 3 1/2 hr to prepare.

Their \"5 flavour duck\" most well marinated braised duck that's available around here.

Don't consider too much of the ambience. Just go for the soup and dishes.  Is the content that matters not the cover of the book"}
{"text":"This is for their dinner service .  Lunch is great. Dinner. Meh.   With their location inside a hyper competitive mall, their dinners don't do them any justice.   The duck was Meh. The fresh steamed fish was... freshly steamed but the fish tasted like it was previously frozen.  The vegi was not bad but for the price... a little skimpy.  They offer complimentary soup for lunch but dinner service only have the double boiled soup.  They do offer a sweet soup but water would be more tasty and refreshing.  Service was non existent for 3 tables filled.  Will return for lunch but not again for dinner"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for my family friends, I would've never stepped foot into this establishment. The exterior and interior of this restaurant does not look appealing at all. As many yelpers have commented on the \"dated\" look and wobbly chairs. However, their food definitely makes up for the lack of decor. I can only say so about their dinner items since we only come here for dinner.

The price is pretty decent. For 6 people and 5-6 dishes + rice, we usually pay $10 each. We always order 5-6 dishes for dinner and we usually order the same dishes every time we're here. 

Now, I shall recommend y'all some dishes that may change your minds on this establishment's low rating and hopefully y'all give this establishment a chance (if you haven't yet). 

Besides from the simple Chinese \"choy\" dishes, you can NEVER go wrong with the spicy fried fish. It's a good balance between salty and spicy flavours with a nice crunch to it. One piece of this fish will leave your taste buds begging for more! Another MUST: Wei's handmade minced meat cake with squid. This is the best meat cake I've ever had! It's very tender and lightly flavoured with a taste cooking wine in every bite. The pieces of squid adds some texture to the over experience.

Tired of the usual fried eggplant dish that's drenched in a red spicy/tangy sauce? Not to worry, because at Wei's, they offer an alternative eggplant dish that tastes just as good! This eggplant dish is cooked with clams and assorted veges and it's drenched in a savoury white sauce that is not spicy at all! Its appearance leaves you an impression of it being bland, but trust me, it tastes better than it looks! Another mouthwatering dish = the sweet and sour pork served in a stone pot.

Lastly, this dish is either a hit or a miss. On several occasions, it was a hit for us however, one day it was just a total miss... This is the satay vermicelli cooked with assorted veges. That one day we requested from extra vermicelli was the day that was a miss--it was totally bland... Not sure what happened here, maybe the chef was just not having it with vermicelli that day. 

To top it off, there is dessert served at the end of the meal such as the recognizable red bean paste or papaya with white fungus.

Have I changed your mind about this restaurant yet? No...? Perhaps, you should experience it yourself! ;)"}
{"text":"I can honestly say Wei's Kitchen is one of the most Unattractive restaurants in First Markham Place!! 

With all the other choices, customers are going into Vietnamese, Korean, Cantonese Restaurants and Wei's Kitchen would be the one that you probably would not ever set foot in! It looks dated, (in fact it is! It took over the previous restaurant without even changing a thing but their signs!), dirty (sticky menus, chairs, floors...), smelly (either from the stinky tofu next door or the things they are cooking!)... 

Lunch Specials from 11:30 am to 5:30 pm, has a great selections of soup noodles ($4.99), rice/noodle dishes ($5.99-$6.99) all includes a drink.. or even soup. 

House Special Duck with Noodle Soup ($4.99) 
- The duck is their house speciality which suppose to have 5 different tastes to it (sweet, sour, bitter, hot, saltiness), I might not exactly experienced the 5 sense of tastes..but I have to say it is really complex and to me the sweet and sour taste were more prominent! 
- The duck itself was quite tender.. and fatty... and portion was great for what I paid!! 
- The soup noodle based itself was flavoured ... and the noodle was cooked properly, not soggy or overcooked at all 

I was pleasantly surprised with my HK style milk tea.. smooth, creamy and flavoured.. never would have expect to have it that good in a crappy place. 

Services was good and attentive.. my milk tea was delivered to my table right before I finished eating my noodle...hot and freshly made!!"}
{"text":"We brought a lot of the seafood they cooked for us because the Choys were regulars and just knew exactly what and where to eat. 

When an establishment cooks Toisan better than Mom, 2nd, and 3rd Aunt, they just deserve 5 stars. 

To be honest, I cannot recall the exact shellfish or style we had them cook after this insanely indulgent and delicious Chinese food tour- but I remember Wei's flavors being exceptional. And exceptionally superior to most already delicious Cantonese fare. 

Truly a down home, 5 table seater ran by mom and pop and children or extended family members... Wei treated us like family. The preserved fatty pork over Chinese broccoli was my absolute favorite. Simple, clean but oh-so-perfect that you just know when you taste it. The 10 lbs of large sweet shrimp just needed the perfect boiling and it was indeed sweet and succulent. We couldn't finish most of it. Had we, we may have needed to be carried out of there. 

Thank you R&D, S&R for everything, but for the purposes of this review, thank you for showing us that homestyled cooking reigns King in our court."}
{"text":"My family enjoyed this place more than I did but it's still a solid little restaurant for traditional Cantonese dishes (??). 

The prices are a little lower than some of the other Cantonese restaurants, but the portions are smaller as well. Which is not to say they are too small - the size is pretty appropriate. I don't like that they don't give you free soup but even after ordering 7 dishes plus 1 soup, our party of 6 was fed for $115 after tax and tip, so the pricing is very reasonable. We finished every single dish and we were all comfortably full!

We had:
*fuzzy melon and pork soup - very nice
*steamed fish - could be better because the soy sauce doesn't taste salty at all and there isn't much of it (in addition to the fact that they don't sprinkle the fish with a bit of salt and white pepper before they steam it, which is what my family does and what I prefer)
*steamed cuttlefish and pork patty (I didn't enjoy this; there was no cuttlefish flavour and the meat was way too soft, though my grandparents appreciated that!)
*black bean stir-fried clams - very good!
*shrimp paste steamed pork belly - also very good, though it tastes similar to what my mom makes at home (but with pork shoulder or butt instead) and of course, my mom's is way better 
*salt baked chicken - VERY good because it's very flavourful (it's well-marinated so the flavor penetrates deep into the meat) and they seem to sear the skin a bit (I'd never had salt baked chicken done that way before and I really liked it!)
*pepper and fermented tofu sauce stir-fried Chinese vegetables (??) - very good
*pan-fried oyster & egg pancake - good"}
