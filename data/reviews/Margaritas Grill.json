{"text":"Great salsa!  And more importantly this is a Mexican Restaurant with healthy choices on the menu!   Great service.  Clean.  Good food.  Great ambiance. Highly recommend this spot. I have had dinner here 3 times over the last 5 months while in town on business."}
{"text":"One star is generous.   Friday afternoon, the place is empty for a reason.  It took over an hour to get a glass of water. The worst service in town."}
{"text":"One margarita, and one margarita only. This place is full of red flags. We sat outside, practically on the curb and inches away from passing cars. The server appeared to be high as a kite, although pleasant. The margarita menu lacked prices, and the server said he needed to ask the bar. When my friend asked what kind of beer they had, he pointed inside to the bar and said, \"all the usual kinds\". She went inside to select her beer, which was by no means \"usual\". When the waiter didn't return with the margarita prices, I also went to order at the bar. The bartender gave me attitude, accused me of \"shopping around\" for a margarita. He reluctantly listed off the prices, first asking me to select which I wanted. They ranged $6-12. Once I ordered my margarita, the price strangely increased by 50 cents - whatever. We observed a server cleaning up a table and spilling salsa all over some chairs and the ground. No one came to clean up, and the next party had to swap their own chairs for clean ones.

Overall the place felt dirty, disorganized, shady, and lacking customer service. I read in another review that prices listed on the menu mysteriously changed on their bill. This is most likely why margarita prices are not listed, and the bartender gave me grief about asking. The margarita was TERRIBLE by the way - pure margarita-mix over ice."}
{"text":"Stopped in and the owner was very friendly. He showed us some paintings he did, and even sat down to talk with us for a bit. The enchiladas were good and the carne asada tacos were even better.

I also had a mango jalapeno margarita. I normally do not like frozen margaritas, but this one was fantastic. We will be back."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on Saturday at 6:30pm and the doors were locked and the chairs on the table.  I suggest perhaps you have to call before you go to be sure they are open."}
{"text":"Visiting Mesa, we stopped in for a beer and an appetizer while antique shopping. We never made it to the appetizer because we were so appalled by the beer prices! Seriously, who charges $4.75 for a bottle of Bud?!? My Blue Moon was $5.75! Walk a block or so west and get a fantastic micro-brew for $4.00! I found their prices insulting. We will never go back. Nothing justifies that!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and have been here over a handful of times.  I agree that some of the entrees are slightly over priced, however, the food is quite delicious! The Macho Nachos are superb and can easily feed 3-4 people. Don't forget the chips and salsa...yum! The service has always been great. Very friendly, outgoing and really welcoming."}
{"text":"1st & most likely last visit there.  We had the \"stuffed\" enchiladas .  Not sure what they call stuffed but sure expected leftovers.  They were small & tasteless.  Nothing was outstanding & was more like something you make at home & small servings of rice & beans... Chips were less than store bought quality with soupy sauce.   I asked for flan which the waitress didn't know was available.  So when the bill came & it was $8, she said she didn't know how to serve it and cut a double serving without saying anything.  She seemed to have been working there less than the 3 months she indicated although the she was very friendly.  I should not have been charged double for her mistake however.  First & last time there as it really was just very average & we really wanted a new place to go!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today with a co-worker. Margaritas is so great!  For a $7.25 lunch plate, I got 2 shrimp enchiladas, rice, beans and THE DRINK INCLUDED! Thank you for not charging me $2 for something that costs you $0.14!! The food was delicious, and I'm typically not a fan of green sauce. But I loved Margarita's sauce.
 
For such great prices, you'd expect this place to be a little divey or \"Mom and Pop\"-ish (I.e. like Mango's Mexican restaurant that's just a few doors down). But this place is totally posh and hip. Really cool, modern art on the walls. Clean simple lines in the decor, chic black and white color scheme. I loved it! Can't wait to come in for a date night and hit that bar! :)"}
{"text":"Ate there for lunch today with a friend.  I got the chicken enchiladas and she got the chicken tacos and they were both very good, I really like their Spanish rice too.  I am glad there's a new place to eat in downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch today and I'm glad I did! The the restaurant was clean and inviting, the server was friendly and the food was delicious! They have a great lunch menu w/ solid pricing. I went with the fish tacos and it turned out to be a good choice! I'll definitely be back to try the enchiladas!!"}
{"text":"The food here is always good but 4 of 5 times we come here at least one order is wrong. If the waiter would write our orders down that might improve. It's frustrating to have limited time for a lunch break and get the wrong order. 
Today, 3 out of 4 of our orders were wrong and they gave a 30% discount. So, we basically got to eat what they decided to serve us for $2.00 off menu price.
I also believe it is obscene to charge $1.00 for a tablespoon of sour cream or 1/4 cup of cheese in a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"There was nothing good about this restaurant.  For a place so awful, they did have cloth napkins; go figure.  There was no friendliness in the air.  Service was below average.  For having the name \"Margaritas,\" my margarita was definitely watered down--worst one I have ever had at hefty price.  Smallest little cup of salsa I have ever seen.  When our bill came and we noticed the prices were higher for our meals than stated on the menu they were using, the waitress just replied that their prices had gone up.  After some polite discussion, she reluctantly left to fix it.  Came back and said that she just credited us $2 (yet $6 below the overcharge).  She said that's just what her manager has been telling her to do (so we weren't the first).  Next time she came back with a $4 discount.  She finally gave us the exact amount that we were overcharged.  We were mostly disappointed that the manager never came out to talk with us to show that he cared even a little bit.  There are much better restaurants in the area of the Mesa Art Center than this one."}
{"text":"Went there once before had margaritas and chips and salsa, I was so impressed. It was great the day bartender who is very nice made fresh delicious margaritas with fresh squeezed lime juice. This last time not so much. Drinks made with really bad pre made sweet and sour mix. Chips and salsa still good, we decided to try the guacamole, it was old and watery and flavorless. Service was less than decent but I don't blame the sever who didn't seem to have been properly trained. We ordered the chile relleno the sauce it had was so extremely salty. I had to get my own silver ware roll up to try it. I had the soup,nice big bowl, and it was tasty. I might've tried a different drink to see if it was better than the original one, but one was never offered. The server was pleasant and very nice, however, it's obvious this establishment is very badly managed. I live in Phoenix and made a very long treck to get there and try the food and it was disappointing to say the least. We will not be returning. Oh well, I wish the owners luck in getting this place in order, really it's just a few changes they could make and they would have a little gem. It's a cute place, but not for me."}
{"text":"My friend and I were headed to another restaurant close by when we stopped to look at the menu in the window. The hostess came outside and handed us two menus. It all looked good, so we changed plans and decided to dine at Margaritas.

This is a fairly small restaurant with about a dozen tables for four on one side of the room. There is also a bar , which I think seats six.

We asked for recommendations since we had never been here before. A few items were mentioned, but he said the Chile relleno was \"killer.\" We both ordered it and thought it was the best relleno we ever had. Came with rice and choice of beans. Everything was tasty. Would we come back? You bet!

If you're going on the weekend, I would call and make a res. The place was packed, including the bar area."}
{"text":"Food was 4 stars review. 

The reason I gave it a 3 was because we were a party of 12 with 4 separate checks and when we got our individual bills everyone filled them out and left a tip! I double checked mine and noticed that tip was included. I know that is common but I feel the restaurant/server should tell us that! They almost got a 40% tip. Felt that was dishonest and slimy. Not cool in my books."}
{"text":"Basic Mexican fare, the prices are way to high for what you get, especially the margaritas (whose prices do not appear on the drink menu - red flag). I ordered the OG Margarita, it was  over-priced, too sweet orange juice that may have been in the vicinity of tequilla. The shredded beef taco left much to be desired - mostly lettuce, hardly any shredded beef. The carne asada burrito is HUGE, the tortilla is delicious but the carne asada was slighly sweet, and strange tasting, not spicy or brightly flavored at all (which to me are signs of quality carne asada). I had about 4 bites and didn't finish it. The waitress (who was very friendly) offered a to-go box but I couldn't bring myself to tell her I didn't want to take the rest of the burrito because it tasted awful. Would I go back - no."}
{"text":"The food was okay but we were appalled at some things that we observed.  First, the food; we ordered the fried shrimp with a chipotle raspberry sauce.  The fried shrimp were ordinary but the sauce was great! We then had the chicken mole and while it wasn't very authentic it was good. Rice and beans were also good but really nothing special.  No complaints about the food but not impressive either.  The causes for concern were this: they had a number of reservations coming in at 6:30 (we knew this because the head server had scolded the hostess for seating us at one of the reserved table - while they were both standing at our table) and in order to be organized the staff brought out two large trays piled high with chips and salsa.  They proceeded to place them on a small box in the hallway right in front of the bathroom door! This box was probably a foot off of the ground! I'm thinking that was a health violation right there.  In about 15 minutes they brought two more boxes and covered the boxes with a tablecloth but they remained in front of the bathroom door.  We also observed a waitress take a straw to 'even out' the top of a frozen margarita, some dripped on her hand and she licked her fingers and then with the same hand took a lime and placed it on the rim of the glass - oh my!  Don't think we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was a bit bland. I had the del mar burrito. The shrimp were overdone, a common preparation mistake in the restaurant industry. The food was a bit bland. I'd like to see a bit more seasoning. Margarita was great, but id like to see course salt used instead of fine salt. Nice atmosphere. Good salsa. I might try it again."}
{"text":"Horrible service!  Would NOT go back. The servers were working hard, but greatly understaffed. Had to beg to be served. We would have left but were going to a performance so by then didn't have time to find another place. Couldn't tell you if the food was good or not. By then we just needed to gulp it down and get out the door"}
{"text":"This review is based on the quality of servie not on the food, as we never received it. Some friends and I went to this joint before a show at the Mesa Theater. The place was busy but not overly packed. We elected to eat at the bar since there was a 15 minute wait for a table. 

When I asked what bottled beers they had the bartender pointed at the back wall where the different bottles of beer were lined up, which was about 40 ft from the bar, and said thats what we have. From the bar I could make out about three or four of the labels, and that was based off recognizing labels of popular brands. The others I could not make out. There was no actual list and the bartender clearly did not have a clue. 

It took about 15 minutes to get our drinks, I ordered a bottle of Dos Equis pretty simple, the bartender then left leaving the bar completely unattended to go to the back to get some bottles of Dos Equis which were not stocked at the bar. He then tried to twist the top off, and even I know that they are not twist off and I have never bartended in my life. 

We placed an order for three quesadillas and waited about another 15-20 minutes for him to notice that we needed another round only after I had to wave him over. The second beer he slammed on the counter and volcanoed it spilling it on the counter then tried to jokingly blame it on me. He did not clean up the spilled beer at all!. 

We continued to wait for an hour for our three quesadillas which should have taken all of ten minutes to prepare. We asked the \"manager\" what was going on with our food and he said, \"some food is coming up I think it may be yours let me check\" only to never return. 

We finally told the bartender after about an hour hour and a half that we had to leave. He ran our tabs for the six combined drinks we had without even offering anything to compensate for the wait times. Then he gave my firend his change and laid it in the puddle of beer from earlier that he did not clean up. He still made no attempts to clean up the mess or exchange my friends now soaking wet bills with dry ones. Though he did unsuccesfully manage to flip his mixer in the air only to drop it on the floor and continue using it.

Both the manager and bartender checked on us about one and maybe a half times in the hour and a half two hours we were there. I'm sure the food would have been good if it ever made it out of the kitchen. Worst dining experience, from a service prespective, that have had in a long time. It was shame because the food actually looked and smelled decent. 

Maybe try it when its dead, but don't go if it is even somewhat busy."}
{"text":"Awful! My husband and I came out to mesa to go to a concert at the Nile and figured we would get out there a little bit early to eat something before the show. We sat outside and the boy that sat us gave us some chips and salsa..which was okay. What was not okay is that we sat around for 15 minutes without someone in the staff even glancing an eye at us..even bringing us water would have been great.

After my patience ran out I looked around and noticed another very unhappy couple asking for the manager and complained about the food. After that we decided we have had enough and simply walked out. The next time I come out to the Nile for a show I will be sure to eat somewhere before we get out to mesa."}
{"text":"Horrible service. All the wait staff looked liked they were walking in circles. They'd be waiting tables then be behind the bar mixing their own tables's drink. I know nothing about running a restaurant but this was the most inefficient place I have ever been in. Margarita tasted as though they forgot the tequila and after an hour our food still never came so we gave up, paid for the tasteless margaritas and left...never to come back"}
{"text":"First time here for lunch.  Ordered a chili relleno.  This was not a good choice.  The food had no appetizing appearance, the relleno was thickly covered with cheese that had melted and solidified making it very rubbery.  The beans and rice were flavorless. I ate a few bites, paid more than it was worth and left."}
{"text":"My mother-in-law and I stopped here for lunch today and got the fish and shrimp tacos.  They were delicious!  I didn't need to add anything to the fish tacos because the flavor was so good.  The chips and salsa were amazing as well. The service was great and the food came out in good time.  I am going to bring my husband back on a date here!"}
{"text":"While I normally only write positive reviews,  I feel compelled to write this review.   Friday night,  regular visitor to downtown Mesa...and not a visitor,  I live here.   Sat at the bar and ordered food and drinks.  As usual,  great food and service.   Got the bill.   $10.50 per drink!  It was a Grey Goose and diet coke.  Seriously????  I wouldn't pay that in downtown Chicago...I certainly didn't expect it on main street in Mesa, AZ.   Total screw!  I'll never go back here again."}
{"text":"What a great dinner spot. Our server was an absolute delight. Service was fast and friendly. Food was excellent. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I visited Margaritas Grill yesterday for a happy hour snack. I ordered a Carne Asada Quesadilla, and I must say some of the most flavorful and delicious carne asada I ever had. The portion was just right and the wait staff was interested in where and why I was there. This is my second time visiting and they remembered me and some things we had talked about previously. The decor and atmosphere is delightful and exciting. Many of the paintings are from local artist and they provide and community feeling. Next time I visit I'm planing happy hour with the girls for some margaritas! I would suggest it to anyone who is looking for some great food and some time to relax."}
{"text":"The margaritas are good the food is not the best and the portions are small. Better off grabbing a few drinks and hitting up filabertos afterwards."}
{"text":"The food is SUPURB! Everything on the menu is great. Margaritas are out of sight...if you want outstsnding authentic Mexican food MargaritaGrill is the place to go. The service & staff are outstanding. We are now regulars! Thank you for bringing excellant food to Main Street!"}
{"text":"Really would like to see this venue succeed in downtown Mesa! However, during my most recent visits here the disappointment level is now high! On \"First Fridays\" the place is packed and not properly staffed!! Orders were randomly presented taking 40 minutes for our table of four to receive ordered plates! My next visit was with a group of eight prior to a production at the MAC! Again, truly understaffed and the place was jammed! We made a reservation; however, our table had to be prepared upon our arrival! Our server, Cisco, was not attentive; delivered our dishes two at a time over a period of 30 minutes and then was offended when asked for our bill!! Needless to say, it will be some time before I venture back!"}
{"text":"One star is still to polite considering the rude and horrible service we received. On 11/7/14 at 6pm I had the single worst dining and professional experience of my life. Prior, We arranged with the owner to have a party of 50-60 people at this establishment and it was agreed we'd get happy hour specials. When we arrived at the agreed upon time the restaurant had one table with 4 chairs available for 50 people. They gave us attitude and acted like we were inconveniencing them. The small group of people who were actually served, were served by a manager who was obviously....um...impaired and rude. He kept making it a point to serve the pregnant girl last and thought it was funny. The majority of our party dispersed before being served and the evening was basically ruined. There were so many negative issus, I could go on and on but I'll just leave it at this...There are MANY quality eateries in downtown and places like this will drive clientele away and ruin the positive vibe in downtown. I know I'll never return and I'll never recommend anyone go there considering the many other better quality options. My group still dropped over a grand at this place for hands down the worst experience of our life."}
{"text":"On top of extremely slow, discourteous  service and 45 minutes to prepare food, the drinks are extremely weak. Had the margarita, had a very slight taste of lime and no taste of tequila at all. (Check out Ztejas margarita, a good model to follow). Three lime slices helped taste, but not much more. The Pinot Noir was my first choice but they ran out of that before 6:30."}
{"text":"We sat outside on the patio.  The weather was beautiful and we really enjoyed the food.  I wish they wouldn't allow smoking out there because having to hold my breath each time the old lady took a puff kinda ruined the pleasant atmosphere.  The margaritas are $3 during happy hour.  They were ok...hardly any alcohol.  The service was great.  Everyone was very nice.  The food was really delicious.   I'd recommend trying it sometime!"}
{"text":"Overall a great place to come for some delicious Mexican food.  To start off, it was very easy to find and with the name Margaritas, it was an easy choice. My boyfriend and i like to try different places for our date night.  

The people were extremely nice and attentive, but not overbearing. They allowed us to enjoy our food ( unlike some other restaurants ) . mango margarita was yummy; the perfect combination of alcohol . I ordered the chimichuga with side of rice, beans and lettuce. DELICIOUS. I am from California and this definitely reminds me of home ! Will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Cisco and Sandra don't miss a beat. Friendly efficient service. Delicious food and comfortable atmosphere!"}
{"text":"It is really expensive for mediocre Mexican food. And it was a little like opposite day for our experience. Was asked if I wanted white or yellow cheese in my enchilada. I asked for while, and received yellow. My husband ordered the overpriced midori margarita and they asked if we wanted sugar or salt on the rim. Asked for sugar, got salt. And for 6 people they automatically added an 18% gratuity? For less than decent service? Won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Wow terrible service - actually non existent due to an event at mesa arts center.  Don't they plan? Walked in and sat no help. Got up and left plus it looks like a run down place. I will recommend a pass!"}
{"text":"They overcharged us by $3 on a salad then when confronted charged us automatic gratuity. First time there, never again!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 8.  Came in to have Margaritas and dinner before heading to watch a fitness competition across the street November 11th.  3 of us ordered their signature margarita.  Others ordered Mexican beer.   Beers came out warm with NO offer of chilled glasses.  Our margaritas were the worst margaritas we have ever had.  Each of us took a sip.  Asked immediately of the waiter to either try and fix them or just offer us a beer.  His response was that the margaritas could not be fixed.  It is a premix and we would have to pay for them regardless.  Wow, great customer service (NOT).  With the lack of concern and service as well as underwhelming drinks, we decided to pay up and head over to the competition.  We hit up a restaurant up after and spent $350.  Had a great time with better than average food.  Can not see how they are called Margaritas and have the worst one each of us ever had.  I am not one to post negative comments often, but this was historically terrible in our book!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  We walked in and were told to sit wherever by the greeter.  We grabbed our own menus while one server proceeded to rearrange tables and not even acknowledge us.  The bartender brought food outside and told us someone would be with us.  He then went to the bar and continued serving drinks in a barely full place.  After another five minutes watching two employees standing around talking, we got up and left.  Service like this will get you no where and I'm afraid this restaurant won't make it unless they train their employees on customer service."}
{"text":"This place should not be in business.  It has gone to the bottom of the barrel.  It used to be ok, but the outstanding part is it is across the street from the Mesa Center.  The quality of the food has gone down to zero, and the same for the service.  Tonite, every table outside was almost comedic!  We were all complaining, then laughing about how could a restaurant stay in business putting out plates like a taco salad without the Taco, shrimp tacos with one shrimp in each taco along with lettuce, and the stuffed quesadilla used to be stuffed with grilled chicken.  This time it was more unfilled than filled.  We waited one hour for them to serve us our dinner.  All the manager would say is I'm sorry.  We asked the server what was going on with this restaurant, and she said they had let three servers go and they only had one chef working on a nite of an event across the street.  Convenient?  Yes!  Do we have to find another restaurant?  YES!  Too bad that they don't know how to run a restaurant.  They forgot to charge for drinks....Not so good for the profit, but I guess it worked out with the 3 shrimps in 3 tacos and 1/4 the chicken in the quesadilla.  Just awful and embarrassing since we brought two couples along with us!  At least the show was good across the street!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here earlier today for lunch and it was amazing! The shrimp relleno was to good to be real! I'm definitely returning to this place ASAP!"}
{"text":"Not horrible by any means, but nothing special either. I got their chorizo burger which was good, but again, nothing special. I certainly would stop in again if need be, but wouldn't go out of my way to return. I will note, their chips are the best I've ever had. Ever. Service was fine and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"While the atmosphere nor the cleanliness was my favorite, the food was pretty good and our server was on top of his game. We only had about 20 minutes to have a quick drink and eat and the server was able to accommodate us.

My friend and I ordered the Stuffed Shredded Chicken Quesadilla, which costed $9.75 and each got a beer. The quesadilla was definitely large enough to split and was seasoned well. My mom ordered the #1 which came with one taco and one enchilada. She was very satisfied with the flavor of her dish and it was more than enough food.

I don't think I will be back for the simple reason that I just didn't feel that this place was very clean and was in disarray, but the service was great and the food was acceptable."}
{"text":"Not worth a single Star. Extremely poor service!   They lost our order, waiter does not come by to refill drinks.  Very poorly managed establishment.  STAY AWAY from this place.  I will never come back to this place.  STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"Ordered the original margarita - it was far from it. More like a slush with no tequila taste whatsoever.  $8 bucks- not worth it."}
{"text":"Tried dining here twice. First time was turned away becuse they were no longer seating at 8:30 pm. Second time I went inside and asked if they were seating the patio, bartender said yes. Sat on the patio and got no service. Went inside just to be ignored by all of the staff so we left. I understand a restaurant being busy but ignoring customers is unacceptable. Mesa needs more and better food places downtown."}
{"text":"We were going to a play at the Mesa Art Center and planned to go to the old restaurant at this location.  It was gone so we tried Margarita.  We were so pleased!  We had delicious guacamole & a yummy cheese crisp to start.  Then my husband had his new favorite chicken mole and I had the best soup!  I just wish I could have tried more of the menu because it all looked so great!  

We may attend more events in Mesa just so we can start with dinner at Margarita's.   The prices were very reasonable as well and their Margarita menu looked so good that we almost ordered some even though we don't drink!"}
{"text":"Overall, I would say this place has decent Mexican food.. the thing is I didn't feel like there was anything above average at this place. I really enjoyed the carne asada and the queso is a really rich appetizer which will leave you wanting more BUT they stop serving food at 8:30pm, and for downtown Mesa, they are a bit pricey. $12 for a cocktail, that is not a craft cocktail, or in downtown Chandler or Scottsdale seems a bit steep to me. There aren't many places to eat open late in downtown Mesa by the Arts Center and I think it would benefit customers if food was served a bit later. While my fiance and I were there they ended up turning 2 groups down at 8:30 since the kitchen was closed, so they walked a few blocks down to go to Desert Eagle. 

If you are downtown and looking for run of the mill restaurant Mexican food, or a $12 grateful dead cocktail- you may want to stop in!"}
{"text":"The best salsa and the pollo asada nachos were amazing. Not greasy or soggy at all. Seasoned to perfection. Defiantly coming back. Our server was very nice and attentive. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have a group that meets a few times a month and we thought eating in Downtown Mesa for 2nd Friday and seeing the vendors would be nice. So I called a night ahead and reserved a seating arrangement for 8 people on the patio for 6pm. I arrived 15 minutes early and they had no idea what I was talking about. Nor was the seating arrangement made for the group. I had to move the 5 tables and 10 chairs MYSELF b/c I was getting no help from the staff. Camyn was very helpful for the first 4 people who arrived with orders and drinks, but  became overwhelmed and neglected the second 4 people of my party. They waited for 30 minutes to get refills on their drinks at one point. Restaurant was busy so we were trying to be patient. But once it was time for the checks the restaurant was dead, I told Camyn we were ready for the check twice and a busser told her three separate times. We FINALLY got our checks once we came in the restaurant and blocked the floor space until we got our checks. This process took 45 minutes to get the 6 checks. Several of the checks didnt agree in check price when compared to the menu price. Manager, who was bartending, and other servers didnt seem fazed. So I take that this treatment is par for the course. Food was good, but not good enough to be worth this hassle. I wont be returning or recommending them to anyone."}
{"text":"My 4th time here for lunch. Delicious salsa! And the friendliest staff in downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"Love this place! We have been to Mesa Arts Center for a few plays and needed a place within walking distance to have a bite to eat. So happy we found Margaritas! Tasty and fresh food, nice service and great margaritas! I had a great tasty soup and fresh elegant salad with chipotle raspberry vinaigrette. So unexpected for a Mexican restaurant with a nice mix of greens and fresh, fresh! Did I mention the margarita selection? Just try this before or after going to an event at M.Arts Center and you'll never need to find another place!"}
{"text":"I liked sitting on the couch in back to eat.  The service was very pleasant and attentive.  I loved the chips and salsa.  The mango jalapeno margarita on the rocks was amazing.  The best margarita I ever had.

Unfortunately the carne asada tacos weren't yummy at all.  Very bland, no flavor.  Same with the re-fried beans.  I added a co-workers avocado and sour cream as well as salsa to the tacos and ate them.  Wouldn't order them again!!"}
{"text":"Horrible!! Should have trusted the other reviews, but this was not my choice to check out this place. A friend's friend said it was a great little place for margaritas & that is the only reason why I went. Little to no parking, you have to park down the street. Arrived around 5ish, it was a bit busy from the Spring Training crowd. Our server was nice, but the food was tasteless. I ordered the shrimp enchiladas. The shrimp was over cooked & the size of a quarter. The black beans needed salt & the carne con queso dip was a bit soupy. The margaritas were too sweet w/a splash of alcohol.  Definitely will not be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Great place. Food was very tasty. The grill chicken burrito was very good. The original margarita was a little bland but the Mango Margarita was amazing. Service was very friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Meh. Stopped in for a quick lunch. Decent food (really good tortillas, actually), and decent overpriced margaritas. 

The star rating is more reflective of the painfully slow service. The server seemed a bit lost; maybe she was new? She didn't seem to think that a pen was necessary when bringing back my receipt to sign, and was nowhere to be found after dropping off the check... Thankfully the lady at the next table had one. 

One and done."}
{"text":"The service was amazing, our waitress was sweet and friendly, just the right amount of attentive. The food was delicious, we ordered the guacamole, shrimp tacos, machos nachos, killer chimichanga, Del Mar burrito and the flan. All were excellent!! My husband and I ordered the blue agave and strawberry margaritas, frozen, and both were really good. If we find ourselves in Mesa again we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My sister's and I had the privilege of spending time together for the Scrapbook Expo, so we celebrated our 3 birthdays here at Margarita' s Grill. Our server, ANTONIO was AWESOME!!! Not only did he offer great service, which included his nice smile and great personality, but he went beyond that. He played our special music, made us special drinks and offered great meals. Salsa was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Please save your money and eat anywhere else small portions tasteless some stuff burnt other under cooked service was good that's why one star if you come to downtown Mesa eat first then enjoy beautiful Mesa"}
{"text":"Can I give this place 0 stars? Because we walked in and couldn't even get service. There were two women servers working at the pace of turtles. With only 6 tables in the whole restaurant, that means 3 tables a piece. If you can't handle more than 3 tables, you probably shouldn't be a server. 

It's unfortunate for the owners that they are losing out on service because of a lack of hustle. Being a party of 8, we no doubt would have spent some money here, but after waiting 15 minutes with no water and no apologies, we got up and left. Not only that, but two more couples behind us did the same. Will definitely NOT be back to try again."}
{"text":"Our nachos were stale and sparsely garnished.  My margarita was served in a cracked glass and was the worst tasting I've ever had. We will most definitely not be back. The only time our server paid attention was when she brought the check."}
{"text":"This establishment should be a candidate for one of those reality TV restaurant makeover shows. Bar Rescue, Restaurant: Impossible, Kitchen Nightmares...somebody (anybody?) help Margaritas out, please!

Chef Gordon Ramsay would scare the living daylight out of the whole staff and fix the menu, Jon Taffer would bring in a mixology to help craft some much needed new and tasty cocktails, and Chef Robert Irvine would bootcamp the decor and management into shape.

Margarita's website boasts: \"Enjoy outstanding service and authentic Mexican food\". 

Whelp! Those are certainly some BIG shoes to fill even at an outstanding restaurant. Unfortunately, for Margaritas, that statement is in a galaxy far, far away from reality. 

The food here was okay...my gosh, that is being nice. I am one to ALWAYS finish my food and if I don't, then I ask for a to-go box. Not the case this time. The food was just not good. It was a very strange feeling leaving unsatisfied and empty handed.

There were a few events happening at Mesa Arts Center that evening so it was a busy night and the place was packed-in like sardines. The wait-staff simply could not handle the amount of customers. 

We received no water or chip refills and all the servers seemed super overwhelmed running inside and outside of the restaurant trying to juggle the customers. Honestly, we only tipped because we felt so bad for our waitress, but the tip wasn't really deserved based on the experience we had here. Redistributing server areas might help or maybe management could step up and help instead of standing around talking (hint-hint). 

Lastly, I have no idea what the issue was but it took well over 30 minutes for us to get our check after our food was cleared. That was just ridiculous. That could have be an open table to seat new customers who had been waiting. Also, once we received the check, they couldn't figure out how to split it. Nothing fancy just down the middle. SMH.

Margaritas would be my last pick for Mexican food in the downtown Mesa area. A more accurate statement for their website would be \"enjoy barely passable service and mediocre food\". Overhaul this place, please! Or just put this place out of it's misery and turn it into a nice wine bar instead!"}
{"text":"I am so sorry to leave such a negative review of this establishment, I just visted this establishment and entered in the parking lot entrance and entered not knowing that it was a step down into to the dining area....and I fell... (ouch) the patrons nearby was very concerned regarding my delima....but the employees thought it was hilarious....very embarrassing....I have been a regular customer of this establishment and I was very insulted by their actions....I will never return to this place, not only was I embarrassed by the the fall but I was insulted by the  reactions of the employees,  what a gracious show of appreciation of customer loyalty....
Your establishment is not the only game in town....I will deter all of my friends and business associates to avoid this establishment at all cost from this point on!!!

VERY DISSAPOINTED CUSTOMER!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, reasonable prices, very good food! The waitress was very helpful, and helped keep things efficient since we mentioned we had a time frame to meet. We came in on a whim, and we were not disappointed. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"My experience here was fantastic. I came for lunch and the veggie wrap was delicious, but the most impressive aspect of my dining experience was the service. My server, Taylor, was incredibly attentive and sweet. I'd recommend to anyone looking for a wholesome restaurant and generally a good time!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! Very reasonable prices, plus 10 percent off for City of Mesa employees. The wait staff are nice, the salsa is good. Food came fast. Only thing I didn't really like is, it's rather dark in there and a little stark so that is off putting in my opinion. Once I was seated though, I was fine. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place. But the service is just too bad. Wish they take a little bit more pride in the place because it's just right down the street from my house on main street. The food is hit or miss. The salmon salad I got was a huge mess! Salmon tasted old, over seasoned, super thin, just iceberg lettuce and standard grocery store dressing. Avocado was fresh and yummy though. It was nice to have chips and salsa included. The salsa was great, but overall this place is not worth the risk with Nunthaporn across the street and the great Republica Empanada just down the street on Hibbert and first Avenue."}
{"text":"Smaller portions compared to others which was ok for me, but same price. Very watered down well Margaritas. Flavorless.  Good tasting food. Reasonable ambience for an old building. Restroom overflow and unusable.   Slow service especially getting check. I probably won't return for So-So experience."}
{"text":"Wow, excellent food and service was fast.  We were with a large group and we were surprised that they were able to serve us so quickly.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ok. The food is quite good. Better than average even. But their bloody marys actually get that flavor trumps hot."}
{"text":"The waitress was extremely helpful! I liked that we could eat on the patio right on main street but it got kind of cold and we moved inside to the couch area way in the back. There were TVs with sports games on and a live mariachi band playing. That was cool. Best part again was the friendly staff.

The food was ok. We were served chips and salsa but the menu was a little pricey and limited selections. The drinks we got were about $14 each which is quite a lot. It's probably one of the only Mexican places in downtown Mesa so it's convenient if you are trying to stay in the area."}
{"text":"First time in tonight. Sat at the bar and started with a margarita.  After using restroom it was clear I needed to leave. Over flowing broken toilet, cleaner sitting out and trash on the floor. I was done after I saw a giant roach next to my foot. I paid for my drink that wasn't good and left before finishing my drink. I told a server, who didn't seem to care at all. Beyond disappointed."}
{"text":"Evidently this was a place called Posh Nosh till 2007, then de la Cruz Bistro from 2008 till summer of 2012. Margaritas Grill just opened up about a week ago and I stopped in tonight because I was in the area and ready for a bite.  I had researched it for info and only found one review, on Urbanspoon, which said it was great and meals were priced reasonably at under $10. I don't eat a lot of Mexican food in AZ because I can get it so easily in San Diego but I'm always game to try a new place of any kind.

The menu is not extensive but has some delicious sounding choices, mostly seafood.  The prices were decidedly not under $10. Dinners were mostly $12 and up, even some of the appetizers were $12-13.  I got a dinner special that was not on the menu after my server told me about it. It was a tamales plate with rice and beans for $10. I am admittedly on somewhat of a budget since I'm just visiting, though long term, and usually just eat out once a day.  I decided to splurge a little and got a House Margarita for $5 too.

My waitress was great, very friendly and attentive, checking on me periodically to see if I needed anything.  A+ for service.

The pork tamales were really good.  They had a lime touch to them that gave them a nice tang, the meat was very tender.  They were pretty mild, which I liked, but some people might find them too bland for their taste if they like theirs spicier.  

The beans were so good I was sorry there weren't more, they disappeared too fast.  They were the thinner style so what looked like a wide portion was really a bit small since they spread out.  They would have made a fantastic bean dip.  The rice was also very good, maybe some of the best rice I've had this trip.  The amount was appropriate.  The tamales were neither huge nor puny, just average.  I would say it was a meal worth the $10.

The lettuce wasn't awful, just not cold, crisp, fresh, or seasoned in any way.  It was chopped large like a salad yet had no dressing.  There was no sauce, salsa, sour cream, guac, cilantro etc to add a little variety to the plate.

The Margarita was very good, didn't seem real strong, but I wouldn't have wanted it to be since I was driving.  It had a nice balance.

If I were to make a suggestion it would be to include a dollop of sour cream and maybe even a bit of guacamole and salsa to make it more interesting, and increase the portion of beans. Beans are cheap, you might as well be generous. 

It was a bit dark for photography but I did get a few pics which I have posted.  The atmosphere was pleasant and relaxing, though.

I would say if you're in the area and hungry, this would be a solid place to eat. If I get back next trip I think I'll try one if the seafood dishes. I almost got the tilapia fish tacos tonight."}
{"text":"This place is super reasonably priced for what you get and the food is great! It has a great atmosphere and authentic Mexican food. 

I love that it's right across from the Mesa Arts Center so we can grab a bite before a show."}
{"text":"We came for Dia de Los Muertos Celebration in downtown Mesa....they could not handle the traffic coming in from the festival.  The service was not great and we only came in for drinks.  The poor customers trying to get seated for food that was a longer wait as this place is not really that big.  

So, 30 minutes later we finally got our drinks at the bar and I will say my margarita was pretty good (3 stars not 2).  We had a server come by and ask if we wanted chips and salsa, we said, YES..never came.  The whole establishment was pretty overwhelm.  Downtown is begging for a great and fun establishments to pop into and after this experience this will not bring me back to Margaritas Grill. Sorry."}
{"text":"Chips and Salsa were delicious!

Enchiladas were fantastic.

I am so happy to have found this little gem. I work down the street and am definitely looking forward to coming here again. The owner was so nice. 

We have been there several times now. Each time the service has been wonderful. There are a few TVs for watching sports. I haven't had a chance to try any of their margaritas, but I'm looking forward to my next trip there."}
{"text":"Awful experience, DON'T COME HERE! waste of time and money! Rude employee named Marisa or Maritsa.... we were fine with paying for drinks but wouldn't take off a disgusting cheese soup. If you enjoy good quality mexican food. Go to mangos just down the road from here or even go to Taco Bell they are even  more authentic than this place. NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Went for lunch first time here, Great SERVICE. Tasty food. Had the Shrimp Tacos yummy with just the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"Steak and Chicken Fajitas Yummy! Fish Taco Delish! Chips and Salsa Mmm! \"OG Margarita\" Awesome!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Not sure how they were able to completely remove flavor. Table was dirty. When I wiped it with my napkin, there was black dirt. Service was fair. Server was pleasant. Walk another 100 yards to Mangos."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner last night, but more important, great service! Our group of 3 had a 6:30 reservation, with tickets for an 8 pm show, across the street, at Mesa Arts Center.  Just before leaving our home for the restaurant, our neighbor fell and was seriously hurt. We called an ambulance, and, of course, waited to see our neighbor was in good care. By the time we left our house,  it was already 6:30. We would be a half hour late for our reservation. When we arrived  there were \"walkins\" at the hostess station, who were turned away, because the restaurant was full. I feared we would also be turned away. Much to our surprise, our table on the patio, awaited.  Aaron, the manager, and our waiter offered suggestions of dishes to order which would give us quick delivery of our meals. The margaritas, quesadillas, guac and chips were very good. We had plenty of time to enjoy our meals and comfortably make the show!"}
{"text":"I really don't know where the 5 star reviews are coming from. Almost gave it a 3, but I won't be back, so 2 stars it is. There were two waitresses on when we came in. One was very professional, the other was high. Guess which one we got. I told her my drink order and by the time my girlfriend ordered a margarita, she had already forgotten my beer. (No short term memory.)  Apparently, at least during the day, the wait staff doubles as bartenders. Our waitress had no business behind the bar. She left the ice scoop on the bar (unsanitary) and left bottles on the bar between steps (bad practice).

The our food came out. Of course, she forgot which one of us had which food. It had been about seven minutes and we were a whopping table of two. The beans come out of a can. The rice had a strange, off-putting taste that I couldn't place, although my girlfriend said it tasted like fish to her. We both had enchiladas, hers shrimp, mine shredded beef. Both sauces clearly came out of a can or jar. 

If you want fresh, well made Mexican food, this is not the place to come. Frankly, I would rather have had Filibertos. As I didn't feel satisfied after my meal, for dinner I went to Ranch Market for the best carne asada in the valley for a quarter of the price I spent at one of the most mediocre restaurants I've been to outside of a chain. 

On the plus side, the chips and salsa were pretty good, although I guarantee they are not made in house."}
{"text":"YUCKKKKK. Cheese dip is basically. Don't order, stay far away from this place. When asked if we can return our food the girl working.. Marisa or Maritza not sure, responded to our soupy, watery, disgusting  \"dip\" that's \"that's how it always is\"  and when asked if we can return it she said \"well it costs money to make soooo...\" and walked away. I can't even handle it. Also, Guac had lots of brown. But it costs money to make so we didn't even bring that up in risk of being walked away from again. I have NEVER experienced such awful \"customer service\" or disgusting food..."}
{"text":"Always great service. Wonderful food great drinks and great atmosphere. I love CUNY day here every time"}
{"text":"Came here for the 2nd Friday of the month event. They weren't aware this was the dog friendly event. They came out flustered. Our waitress didn't take our order for 15 minutes. After 6:30, so she made us miss happy hours. It's 95 degrees out. We need water for our dogs and they don't ever bring it. They don't fill our waters up, the people who sat down next to us got their order before we got ours. We got up and left. Never recommending this place to anyone. It's dirty."}
{"text":"We've eaten at most of the good places in downtown Mesa and driving by my wife said lets eat here. 
     We walked in a realized they are still renovating some of the place and it is coming along nicely.
     Walking in we also noticed the smell of some wonderful food. 
     They brought out salsa and chips. It looked normal, but wasn't in anyway. It was fill of flavor and had just the right amount of kick.
     We ordered the Guac and was pleasantly surprised at how fresh it was and so flavorful.
     I had the Mole de Pollo and my wife ordered the Cheese Enchilada and a Green Chili Burro in Red Sauce.
     Mine was very good though the Chicken could have been chunkier. It was so very good. Their beans are almost as good as my moms.
     My wife's plate was huge and she devoured half and took the rest home. It's not often she comments on how good the red sauce it at most places. This one she really enjoyed.
     If you don't mind the sparse walls, you will love the food."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it was great! Had the shredded tacos lunch special and definitely recommend it! Only negative thing I would say is that the salsa had great flavor but not spicy"}
{"text":"Honestly, why this is called a Mexican restaurant is beyond me. Smallest order of fajitas we have EVER had. Guacamole was literally a mashed avocado and the chicken dish I got with the jalapeño creme cheese sauce I am still trying to figure out. The salsa was awesome and so was the waitress but the food? No..."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is absolute shit.  Drinks were lame. Service sucked. No parking whatsoever. Never will come back."}
{"text":"Do not recommend, and do not plan on returning.  I am not sure if the staff who are there are not able to help the waitress.  Waited a long time to be seated, when we walked in a lady setting tables saw us, kept setting tables and continued to ignore us.  We were finally seated and waited a good while before we received menus, waited another while before the waitress said she would come back. Kept waiting, she offered to take our drinks but not our order.  The whole experience was slow.  It wasn't very busy when we arrived and other tables seated after us received faster service than us.  We ended up having to take our food to go because of the time."}
{"text":"Went in for Friday late lunch and were treated like royalty!!!   Our server, Antonio, was fantastic, attentive, and patient.   The Cadillac Margarita was yummy and hit the spot!   Our food was very good, tasty, salsa was delicious too.   Would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"First time here. I ordered the chicken flautas. And my husband ordered the fish tacos. Both were really good. I think they are a bit pricey for Saturday lunch but it was good. The service was exceptional and the staff were really friendly."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch specials! Great service, awesome environment, and amazing staff!
The food is super fresh, very tasty, nothing gross, greasy, or corner cutty about it. 
I had the two tacos al carbon with Carne Asada and was quite impressed with the size of the meal, as well as the tastiness! 
This will absolutely be my new go-to lunch spot, as I live and work in downtown Mesa!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Had lunch at Margaritas after a swim meet in Mesa and was pleasantly surprised.  If ever in the area and are looking for Mexican food, I would suggest you try this place.  Clean and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Last Sat March 28th on my first trip to Mesa AZ my roommate and I discovered this place called Margarita's Grill. The first thing I have to comment on was the excepetional service we got from the manager/bartender Aaron. Everything he suggested was spot on. For appitizers we had peppers stuffed with shrimp wraped with bacon. For drinks it was cadilliac margaritas. The staff was friendly  and proffesional.

I was in AZ for spring training baseball. When I come back next year I will make sure to come back again.

Nice job Aaron"}
{"text":"Prices a little high for the quality of food and drinks. Went with an off menu item, shrimp inside a pepper and wrapped in bacon set in soy sauce. Something different, tasted good. Lots of homeless people in the area."}
{"text":"I work next-door to this restaurant. Everyone I work with has discouraged me from going there and I just didn't understand why.  When I walk in the place --even though it's a pretty decent size it only has about seven tables. All tables were full or dirty. I stood at the door for several minutes before I was approached. Although the person who approached me was very nice, it still took a couple of minutes or more to get the table cleaned off. Then I sat down and still wasn't even given a menu. I waited five minutes and then I decided to leave. Everything was taking way too long person on a  strict lunch hour, Now I guess I know why no one from my office goes there for lunch. I'm disappointed I didn't get to try their food."}
{"text":"Nice little gem for downtown Mesa! 
Salsa was great, the tacos I had were delicious, and the atmosphere is quite nice. I ordered the Cadillac margarita which was just ok, and the refried beans were pedestrian but a good experience nonetheless"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! We came here for a quick bite and the food was so delicious! We ordered some street tacos that were on special and the macho nachos with carne asada. The tacos were really good, and the nachos were probably the best I've ever had. I would definitely recommend this place. We stopped here before a concert, and we were blown away by how good this place was! I would give more stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Certainly a good Mexican restaurant. I wouldn't go so far to say that it's a great restaurant. 
We came around 6pm on a Saturday and it was packed. I'm taking 20 tables and 2 servers. The Mesa arts center is across street and so this place fills up with show goers. If you just want dinner be sure to come at 7 after the audience has left- way more pleasant."}
{"text":"Saturday lunch consisted of chicken chimichanga and second diner had shrimp tacos. The food was excellent with good potion size. Margaritas were very good, also. Service was polite but very slow. Would recommend the food, but you'd better not be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Their margaritas looked good and staff was friendly.. but I do have to say it was pretty dead for a Friday night.. we stopped here after we did our escape room next door and we were maybe 1 of 3 tables.. couple people ordered food simple stuff like nachos and quesadillas.. I didn't here any complaints about the food but it just looked a little eh in my opinion.."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for dinner before heading over to a coffee shop for some music. It was pretty busy and the staff was a little frantic!

I sat at the bar and waited a few minutes to be acknowledged. There were a couple of other people at the bar that were also waiting to be served. The guy behind the bar was very nice and apologized for the delay. 

The chips were very good; thick & crunchy. I ordered the grilled shrimp tacos.  They were pretty good, if a little on the bland side. Adding some salsa helped. 

Overall, it looks like a nice place. The menu had a lot of variety. I think, if they were a little more organized & prepared for a busy Saturday night, it would have been a much better experience.  At least the chaos provided a topic of conversation for the people sitting at the bar!"}
{"text":"I was in the area with co-workers trying to pick a place to stop for lunch. An employee came out of Margarita's Grill telling us how great the food was and how they are the best lunch spot around. He was friendly and we were hungry so we went in there. The place was almost empty when we arrived but did fill up eventually. We placed our orders and the waiting game began... It took about 45 min for us to even get our food and one of my co-workers was given the wrong meal. By the time we finished eating she still didn't receive her meal. They eventually brought hers out wrapped up because they new we were running very late due to their slow service. We all expected her meal would be comped or discounted but no such luck. The food was \"ok\", I guess I had higher expectations."}
{"text":"Really nice place. I went here with 6 friends and our total was under 140(and that's with the 20% gratuity and three drinks). The food was great, I got the carne asada macho nachos and it was really great for the cost.

The staff was also real friendly and our waiter was awesome( even though he gave us a different name every time)"}
{"text":"Wife ordered flauta plate, no sour cream and no refried beans. Flautas had sour cream scraped off, plate had beans scraped off. At least get a different plate! I got taco and enchilada plate, hardly any beef on the little taco. Dry too. Def not worth the $10.

I had to go to the bar and ask for the check. They were busy organizing bottles behind the bar. Workers were at least friendly, so I'll give them 2 stars."}
{"text":"Meh... The food seemed raw, had the veggie enchiladas, the chips to thick & if you have the margaritas have the owners brother make them! Not as clean as I would like to see... So you are asking why"}
{"text":"Everything was just average. The margaritas were unimpressive and the place isn't super clean. Good if you're hungry and you're here."}
{"text":"We had our first dinner at the Margaritas Grill, and I have to say I was impressed.

A group of five showed up around 7pm on a Thursday. Not surprisingly, it wasn't very busy. Our waitress was very nice, friendly, and helpful.

You'd expect that a place named Margaritas Grill would have good margaritas, and they did not disappoint. The stands out favorites were the Cadillac, the Pancho Villa, and the Blue Agave.

One of my personal litmus tests for a decent Mexican food restaurant is good chips and salsa--I mean, if they can't get that right, what hope do they have for anything else? Both were spot on and plentiful.

Everything we ordered was good. My shrimp burrito was lively spiced and combined with avocados. It was a sublime combination that did't rely on the typical sour-cream-and-cheese to give it flavor.

But nothing we ordered carried a candle to the intoxicating Mole de Pollo and Killer Chimichanga with Chili Verde. The mole was sinfully rich--my friend could barely eat more than half of her's, which was fine by me because I got to have some her left overs the next day. And the chili verde was possible the best I've ever tasted. Our waitress told use the chili verde was very popular, and they often end up making three or four batches on busy nights.

Overall, an excellent experience and my new favorite place to eat in downtown mesa."}
{"text":"Folks the reviews here for this establishment here are accurate. But hey i still gave them the benefit of the doubt, well I was proven wrong.  Out appetizer never arrive because the manager on duty gave it to another party....she showed no empathy for error or never came to apologize.  This place was not busy when we got there, the issue i see is the lack of attentiveness for their patrons, they don't care."}
{"text":"This place had great aesthetics, but was underwhelming in service and flavor. 

Pro: Chips and salsa were good! Loved the salsa. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time.

Con: It was probably our server's first time working as a server since we had to ask for water and again for silverware. Drinks from the bar were delayed despite the sparse amount of patrons.

The \"OG\" margarita wasn't bad in flavor, but didn't have any indication that any tequila was in it. My macho nachos weren't bad, but they weren't anything special. 

Hard not to feel \"eh\" about the place on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Came here on tuesday just to pop in for a quick drink. The bartender and waitress seemingly didnt get a long well and seemed very annoyed. I decided to get a spicy jalapeno margarita while my boyfriend just ordered a beer. I thought id get a nice refreshing margarita with some fresh muddled jalapenos. I watched the bartender make.. i was given tequila, triple sec, pickled jalapenos, the vinegar juice from pickled jalapenos, and pepper. Needless to say i couldnt finish said drink."}
{"text":"This place deserves no stars which means if possible if would have negative stars. Went there last night. We stood waiting for a table outside for 30 minutes as people helped theieselves to tables even dirty ones. There were signs on gate that stated wait for host to be served. We asked numerous times when we would be seated they kept saying five minutes when if came time for us they said they had to split up tables. We told them certain people Sat without being taken to table. They didn't make them move. Waitresses and hostesses were rude unprofessional and very insulting. I will not attempt to go there again. We go downtown every Month to motorcycles on main and enjoy the food and entertainment. We were wanting to try something new but I can guarantee I won't bother going there. We went two doors down to nangos. It had great food and service. I talked to the president of NY group and shared my disappointment with margaritas and he said sell one place he won't try. They were looking for a place to eat dinner. He said he will make sure he doesn't suggest this rude bad customer service place to people he knows. Margaritas needs to listen to their potential customers especially after they have walked by them numerous times seeing the same people standing there and do not acknowledge them and at same time see people change at tables that weren't there before or been seated.  THAT IS A NEGATIVE STAR. CAN'T POST WITH OUT PUTTING A STAR RATING SO REMEMBER IT IS A NEGATIVE STAR. They need to learn how to put  their priorities in check"}
{"text":"Great service. Good food. Reasonable prices. Was bummed that they had lunch menu that didn't have many of the things on the dinner menu I would normally want. ..chimi, guac,cheese crisp. Etc. but overall good experience"}
{"text":"Just an average Mexican bar/grill.  I really do think that they could make better money if the servers learned how to multitask though.  Especially when there is a concert venue across the street and curtain call is in a half an hour."}
{"text":"I looked at the reviews and was hesitant to come here, but happy hour coaxed me. I had the chimichanga with shredded beef and it was awesome. Margaritas were great too. I don't see he low reviews here. Server was friendly, food came fast and hot, atmosphere is mellow and it's a hardly a walk from the performing arts center if you need to eat before a show. Give it a shot! I did and I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Such a bad customer service experience, we didn't even sit down. My friend and I arrived at 11am Saturday. I'd read that they open at 11am. When we arrived, we opened the door and saw all the chairs still stacked upside down on the tables and at the bar. There were three employees standing in the main dining room and one at the bar unstacking chairs. One of the women at the back of the room yelled something towards me that I couldn't understand. She yelled it again, saying \"the floor is wet\". I stepped back. It was very awkward moment; they didn't invite us in or assure us that they'd be with us in a moment. In fact, so awkward that my friend and I walked back outside and waited there. About 5 min later, another one of the employees that had seen us when we first arrived, came out, placed the OPEN sign on a stand outside by the front door and walked back in. Despite us standing there, she never acknowledged us, never said \"welcome, we can seat you now\".... nothing. We left, thinking that their food might be as bad as their customer service. Went to another restaurant. There's plenty of them downtown Main."}
{"text":"We will never be coming back to Margaritas again. It took about 15 minutes for our server to get our drink order and another 15 minutes to recieve our drinks (4 well margaritas). I also asked for a side of beans and rice while we ordered drinks and those came out 15 after our drinks. I'm not sure why any restaurant would take that long for a side dish to be served. After an hour we finally received our dinner (2 entrees and an order of nachos). 
Our server was nice but overall, the wait for anything was obsurd. 
When they said they were understaffed I asked if they anticipated the festival that was happening a block away and they said they didn't which makes for a horrible management."}
{"text":"This place isn't good for groups even if they say they can. We brought a group in with two months notice and they weren't ready for us at all. Made us look bad and made our group mad and hungry. The employees where rude and untrained and the food had no flavor. All in all, I wouldn't go back here ever!"}
{"text":"Had the fish tacos for lunch. Not my favorite but people in in our group love coming here. There's a small patio out front and is comfortable. The salsa that came with chips was pretty good. I would def come back but will try something else next time"}
{"text":"Had high hopes that this restaurant would be a great spot for dinner before shows at the Mesa Arts Center.  We had been to all the previous incarnations with the same hopes but have always been disappointed by the horrible service.

Last night, we took my parents out for their 63rd anniversary.  We wanted a nice dinner and to see a Shakespeare play.  We were seated at 6:20 or so.  When a waitress finally stopped by at 6:30 we asked to order and she said, \"Just a minute\" and walked away.  I told her the next time she stopped the we had a play starting at 7:30 so would need to get our order in.  She again said, \"Just a minute\" and walked away.  

Finally, she took our order and we had the hopes that was the end of our disappointment.  Oh no, at 7:15 we looked at each other and said, \"we aren't going to make it\".  At just that moment, our food arrived.  My friend Trish told them to box it up, which they did and my sweetie took it to our car so we could go to the show.

To top everything else off, in my haste, I left without my leather blazer.  I love that coat, it was a hand me down from my mother that I have taken care of and loved for over a decade.  When I realized that I had left it, we went back to the restaurant and it was taken.  Really?

De Garza family, another loser restaurant."}
