{"text":"Cheap. Fried. Bland.  Pretty much sums up the place. If you want it cheap and fast this is your place."}
{"text":"The food here is actually very fresh & delicious, but the service the times we've dined in has been lacking. However, the last visit we had we were waited on by a young girl we hadn't seen before- she actually *waited* on us and wasn't curt like the usual waitresses we get. Perhaps they can hire more like her and increase the patronage! We'll be back - and if she's working we'll be requesting her from here on."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Great selection of foods, from healthy to good ole southern cookin. Love it. I went to the one on Union St."}
{"text":"Parkway house is my favorite place to get food just like my mom cooks. They have awesome, polite service along with a huge menu! The prices are fitting, and I've never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"This Restaurant is the Worst in concord! food is terrible and service as well! I ate there 1 time and have never been back! I can't believe it's still open I think it's mostly for older folks! Well lol even my grandma didn't like it either so I guess I can't say it's for older folks! Anyways I just don't like there food my fries had no salt tasted like they weren't finished and the soda tasted old so I'm good never again! ewwwwwww"}
{"text":"Order the fried squash \"crispy\"...it's great. Salads are fresh green leaf with cuke and cherry tomatoes, not a bowl of iceberg shreds.  We also love the vegetable soup and all of the homestyle vegetables."}
{"text":"Decent family style place.  Skews towards an older demo, a typical kind of Sunday after church crowd. Prices are fairly cheap, portions are huge, and the menu is ginormous. Pasta, pizza, subs, seafood, burgers, home cooked style stuff like country style steak or turkey and gravy. Breakfast all day. The food's probably worth three stars, but the bathroom was gross so it brings it down."}
{"text":"The Parkway is not as impressive as six months ago and it has nothing to do with the food.  Service has really slacked off.  This morning I arrived at 9:15 and didn't get my cup of coffee til 9:30, they came back and took my order at 9:35.  My food arrived at 9:47, but no silverware.  I had to get up, leaving my food, to get my own silverware.  By 9:56 I had eaten my meal.  Here's my point - it should not take 32 minutes to get food you consume in 9 minutes.  I also noticed another lady get up and go to the kitchen to ask for something.  Three mornings ago I left without ever getting a refill on coffee, even when the waitress told me she would get me a refill.  Perhaps my normal 20-25% tip is not sufficient to warrant a continuation of good service.  It is true that their business has picked up, but management should make sure sufficient staffing is scheduled.  The staff appears to be doing too much talking and going outside to smoke to meet the current needs of their customers.   I will probably still go back occasionally, but when I am pressed for time I will go somewhere with faster service.  I also have it on good authority that Santa Claus has taken the Parkway House off his list of quick stops for milk and cookies.  Your are now advised."}
{"text":"Awesome old diner with great food, sweet wait staff and good prices. The turkey Ruben is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Just had my 5th meal here. I've had great food  every time. Open faced roast beef, chicken and dumplings and cheeseburger and fries all served hot and fresh. The staff is friendly and efficient. I've had Avery, one of their servers, wait on me several times and she has been fantastic and wonderful. And she has a great sense of humor. It's been a great place for lunch and dinner. I'm looking forward to having breakfast at some point. If they keep serving good food and keep taking care of customers, I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would for service!!! Ordered a sandwich and hot dogs for takeout, sat patiently waiting until 25 minutes went by with no food!!!! Cashier tried to tell me it took a while to cook the chicken for the sandwich! Unbelievable I think the cooks saw a takeout order and pushed it to the side to prepare the meals that were taken to tables while I sat waiting!  MANAGEMENT wake up before you lose another 10+ year customer!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Charlotte this past week and asked the hotel to recommend a locally owned place for breakfast. Parkway House was where I was sent. It was about 10am in the middle of the week. The seating was open. Service was prompt and friendly. The food was good, filling and cheap. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Myself and my two children stopped into The Parkway House the other day for dinner. It was our first time visiting this restaurant. We were seated in a timely manner and the food exceeded my expectations.  (I expected your typical diner reheated frozen foods, that are passable for the bargain prices they offer.)   We enjoyed the fried pickles, to start. My two kids ordered the hamburgers off of the kids menu, which were tasty (I snuck a bite) and very generous in size! I, myself, had the cheesesteak sub. It was very good, made with fresh and tasty bread and quality sirloin. The prices are low. Can't go wrong there!  Lastly, what made the experience so great was our service. Our server that night was Deja. She was very efficient and friendly. I always appreciate good service, especially regarding my children! So, thank you again, Deja! Great place, and we will be returning for another visit!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and my girlfriend recommended this place. I was craving a Reuben sandwich and it was wonderful. Service was good and food arrived in a timely manner."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to the Parkway House on Union Street S every Sunday for almost 4 years and today was the first time I've walked out.  The restaurant wasn't full and we got sat down right around 10:20am.  We sat for 10 minutes before one of the waitresses came by to get our drink order.  We place our food order at the same time.  Another 10 minutes passed before our drinks were brought out to us.  Then we started to hear the waitresses telling other customers that they were out of syrup and biscuits.  At 11:10 we asked what was going on with our order and it still wasn't ready so we walked.  There have been a few occasions in the past where food didn't come out in a timely fashion but this was absolutely ridiculous.  Especially with a 4 and 5 year old hungry and asking where there food was.  Ever since Amanda stopped working on Sunday's the food and staff haven't been up to prior standards."}
{"text":"AWSOME southern cooking! Portions and price are great. Clean and fun, service with a smile and on top of refills and bussing tables. We eat here every visit, you won't be disappointed- chicken livers, onion rings, and daily specials are the way to go"}
{"text":"Excellent biscuits and gravy!  Not too spicy not bland.   Excellent value and great service!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Parkway House since I was six years old (now 19).  I've always been a fan, but I've just begun to notice how well executed everything is.  I am a culinary student who has worked in all kinds of fine dining restaurants including Bistro la Bon, Firewater Restaurant and Lounge, and Walt Disney World's famous Hollywood Brown Derby.  I love nothing more than a big night out uptown with my girlfriend at a restaurant Uptown but sometimes you just need a big juicy burger with fried pickles on top. I love Parkway.  I see people on Yelp and other review websites complain about presentation and the fact that there isn't a sign that says seat yourself.  They don't put up a sign because they would prefer a friendly greeting, and for Christ's sake it's a diner not The French Laundry. If you want your food to look like it came out of a magazine, spend your whole paycheck on a two ounce steak and a spoonful of potatoes Uptown, but if you want good food that is quickly prepared in a safe, clean kitchen without breaking the bank, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"I've been visiting this restaurant periodically since it opened 15-plus years ago. Its predecessor, Ted's Family Restaurant, was an outstanding local spot. Parkway House does a pretty good job keeping the tradition.  It is not fancy, and the menu features a lot of traditional American fare and comfort foods. I've never gone for breakfast all these years, but in many lunch and dinner visits I have rarely been disappointed. Very good cheeseburgers, and fried seafood is not bad to be 180 miles inland. Try the Parkway House salad - similar to a Cobb salad and very generous size...Elaine from Seinfeld would be pleased. Many of the daily specials are quite good.   And if you visit, you must have the house wine of Concord - get a Cherry Lemon Sundrop to drink (Fanta Cherry and Sundrop soda with a lemon slice).   Parkway House is a good local family style restaurant, they don't do anything elaborate, but what they do, they do pretty well."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times (mostly for breakfast) and they're always consistent. Pancakes are fluffy, sausage is well seasoned and I have yet to have a bad server. It's a super relaxed diner-esque atmosphere, walk in and seat yourself. Simple comfort food."}
{"text":"Food is great here!  Different vegetables everyday which as a weight watcher fan that is important."}
{"text":"This place has it all. A fairly wide ranging menu, attentive staff, and its a comfortable place to dine.  From salads, sandwiches, to your more substantial dinner type foods. The salads are large! (they offer a smaller version of their specialty salads for $1.00 less)   The sandwiches are tasty, if I had to recommend just one I'd say give their philly cheese steak (or chicken) a try.   My husband assures me their breakfast items are great (I'm not a huge fan of breakfast foods so I take his word for it)! The meatloaf which is a daily specials at least on Friday's is great. So are the sides, the offering vary depending on the day of the week it is.   Also they are open 7 days a week, which seems to be a bit rare outside of chain restaurants in this city. The staff is super friendly and after a couple of visits it will be like visiting an old friend!   We live close by so this place has quickly become one of our regular places to go!"}
{"text":"Under new owners. I got as sick as I've ever been from this nasty place. Had to seek medical attention the next day after a long night. The wait staff are straight from the trailer park. Food is disgusting at best. Typical Greeks who haven't a clue, trying to cook southern food. No luck there!!"}
{"text":"NOT EVEN GOOD DINER FOOD!!!  I've been here several times over the years, and had not been in a while. After church Sunday, we were in a hurry so we stopped there and just as before, no matter what we ordered, we had diarrhea within a hour or so of eating there. The usual unhealthy Southern country cooking fare probably cooked with lard -- if you are into that cholesterol- busting cuisine, you will love it.  The service was also slow and terrible and it wasn't even busy yet! We waited forever to get our coffee refilled.  Then, to top it off, I tried to pay the bill with a $20 I got directly from Wells Fargo and the cashier uses a counterfeit-detecting marker and says my money is counterfeit. I took it back to the bank and they told me it was NOT fake and showed me how to detect a real bill from the markings (holding it up to the light). They -- and the FBI -- also said that these so-called counterfeit -detecting markers yield many false positives. (The ones made on my bill were actually a  light brown color that showed it was real, the bank said.  A fake would turn it black, though it is still an unreliable method.)  So someone needs to tell the owner of these places that is not the way to spot a fake and not the way to treat law-abiding citizens. We will NEVER go here again."}
{"text":"Comfort food in a typical diner setting.  Some of the best omelettes around, whoever is Omlette-man here has it right.  Not poofy fluffy but not flat, fresh, hot with quite a few more choices of things to put in them than your average place.    Been hete for lunch and dinner too and have been just as pleased.  Be hungry if you get the Chef Salad, lots of what you want in one.  And we have decided this is THE place to get a cheesesteak!!  You wont be disapointed!"}
{"text":"I just ordered in from this place using their delivery partner Dellish Delivery. The meal in itself is just what I ordered. It hit the spot. A simple dish of rice, lightly spiced chicken and greens on the side. I especially loved the greens and the chicken. The rice was on the colder side but I went with it since I was too hungry to stop and microwave it. The side salad was okay. The only reason I won't give you a 5 is your delivery service partner Dellish Delivery. It took them a whole 1 and a half hours from the time of ordering till the food arrived at my door."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. And almost everything on the menu is under $15. The service is pleasant and the restaurant is clean. It's a simple laid back local spot with good food. No complaints and wouldn't mind coming back at all either."}
{"text":"I love their fried chicken strips and fried okra so crispy! I don't however love their staff, I had to get up several times for items like honey mustard and extra napkins, I had to get up for a to go box too. it's not a huge deal but it's not my job to keep getting up for items that if I was regularly checked on, would have been readily available to me. but I love love their food and prices!"}
{"text":"Usually love coming here because I can get good breakfast and wifi. Was told today that they stopped turning on wifi because it slowed down credit cards. Server was very irritated that I asked about it. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"It is a good southern cooking restaurant with a wide variety of food.  Everything from wings, pizza, subs, salads (the summer salad is my favorite with chicken salad), variety of veggies, fresh daily specials.  Something for everyone if you are looking for a family friendly place.  It is not a fine dining restaurant so is rated for the type of restaurant that it is.  The daily specials are very good, especially like the country style steak, lasagna, and chicken n dumplings.  Service is so so, but again this is just a great home cookin family style restaurant.  We order take out or eat in at least 2-3 times a month."}
{"text":"This a nice decent cozy old fashioned cafe. Good service and fair prices. Everything is just about in house made. This was our first visit. We shall return!!"}
{"text":"I'm from a small town and I get tired of franchise restaurants.  Parkway House may not have the latest frills but the staff is friendly and I've enjoyed a great breakfast each time I visit.  I can't speak on lunch or dinner but I will definitely give those a try! It's affordable for a family and we look forward to enjoying a morning breakfast away from home every now and then."}
{"text":"The food was average at best, but the service is so irritating. They ignore you forever and then when you finally get their attention they seem to think you want to wait even longer. How about prompt and efficient service from the start ?"}
{"text":"A group of us met here for a birthday lunch. The staff was rude and horrible. The food was bland, the chicken and dumplings was dry and thick, the turkey and dressing was horrible. The gravy was full of eggs and disgusting. The best thing we ordered was a cheeseburger which was burnt. Once our food was brought out, we never saw a waitress again. We will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time, your money, or your patience on this place. Extremely over priced for what you get. I never expected anything less of decent food reasonably priced.  If the prices for the food were 1/2 of what they are now... it would then be 3 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Friendly staff & good food cheap!! We found this place while in Charlotte for a dirt race at the speedway..... I'm sure when NASCAR is in town that this place is full all the time. My picky brother even likes this place, and, he hates to spend money!!"}
{"text":"Good food but very disappointing THREE TIMES THEY RAN OUT OF WINGS! Especially today FIRST DAY OF NFL and they are out of wings. I was going to buy 75 wings!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous.  Twice I tried to eat Sun morning breakfast here...twice the same thing happened. ..Hostess seated us...sat there 5 mins....10 mins.....15+ MINS AND NOT SO MUCH AS A DRINK ORDER TAKEN!!!! If you want to eat breakfast before lunch time rolls around then don't eat here."}
{"text":"Based on the food, you would get 3 stars (not the best, but pretty good breakfast .... excellent biscuits). Service was rude or lacking. The best part is the place is FILTHY! Not like, oh we missed one sweeping...we are talking built up grime and grit. I will be posting pictures soon. We actually got seated at a dirty table (place was empty mind you) and the server comes over and skirts around with a dingy washcloth and wipes the crumbs on my lap. Until you clean up, with tons of bleach, we will not be back."}
{"text":"First time stopping by, but it won't be the last.  I had the breakfast burrito added with avocado and chorizo. The eggs were perfectly scrambled. The potatoes weren't overlooked. Other places I've been to cook the potatoes to a mush consistency.  The peppers were fresh and not over cooked; still got a great snap when I bit down. The added avocado was extremely fresh, too.  It was served with side of green chile to dip/slather and, I have to say, it was on point. Great spice kick but not overdone. I could put the green chile on an old worn leather shoe and it would taste amazing. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good quick bite.  The coffee was also damn good."}
{"text":"This morning, I literally walked out of this restaurant for the third time since they opened.  The first time I walked out was because they didn't offer a dinner menu, which was referenced in an HDR article.  The second time I walked out was a result of being seated and ignored for almost 10 minutes.  Today, I placed a simple order...a ham and cheddar cheese omelet with jalapeños, a side of sausage, and a side of livermush.  After waiting 26 minutes with no food, I walked out.  The restaurant was about 1/3 full.    I went to Granny's in Viewmont and ordered the same thing.  I got my order in 8 minutes.  There were significantly more patrons at Granny's as compared to Parkway House.  I wanted to give Parkway House a chance, but three strikes and you're out.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Today was my second time going to Parkway House Family Restaurant and I did not enjoy it.  A week ago a friend of mine introduced me to is and I ordered the porkchops, eggs, and toast breakfast. It was delicious! My friend's daughter got Chocolate Chip Pancakes, and my friend got a BLT Sandwich with egg. Everything came out quick, made to order, and delicious. Our waitress was real friendly and quick to get us refills and checked on us regularly. I knew I'd have to come back.  Today I go with a different friend and order a bologna and egg sandwich (add cheese, tomato, and lettuce) while she got a bacon, sausage, and egg sandwich (add cheese). We both ordered hashbrowns with add ins (cheese, mushrooms, onions, ham). We waited a good 20 minutes for our food and then it came out cold and the hashborwns were burnt/rubbery chewy and disgusting. I added tomato and egg onto my sandwich but it was not on my sandwich when it arrived. I asked for it and it took another 10 minutes for the waitress to bring it out. Upon bringing it to me she says, \"I'm glad you didn't eat it all because I forgot about you!\" in a happy, peppy sort of voice. By then, my food was more than cold and I was not happy. I decided against my meal and she kindly took it away and marked it off the ticket. She waited on the people behind us and told them \"You can't go wrong with breakfast!\" and they got their meal within 5 minutes of placing their order! I found the waitress I had on the first visit and placed a bologna sandwich to go and told her the last one came out cold.  The menu is very fairly priced (which is what gave it one star) and some service is very good (another star).  They serve breakfast all day, which was why we decided to go there when we did. The second visit was very disappointing and I have decided that I will not try them again."}
{"text":"Parkway is down home country goodness with some of the friendliest folk in Charlotte / Concord!"}
{"text":"After a long absence from the Parkway House for poor service, I decided it was time for a second chance. Boy, was I wrong. I went in at 11:30, they were not busy, only a few people there. I stood at the counter \"waiting to be seated\" for 5 minutes. A server walked right by me, looked and then continued on with me just standing there. It is ashamed that indifference from employees can run customers off."}
{"text":"I have drove past this place many times and hesitated to stop but I finally stopped and I am glad I did! I originally wanted the Tuesday special, beef tips and rice but they were out. I guess that was a good sign but unfortunate for me. So I ordered the Deep South Salad. It came in a huge plate with a generous portion of fried chicken strips. It was well worth the value ! My boyfriend got the Parkway house Sub and fries and he really loved it. We will be back !"}
{"text":"Parkway House I found out is a local family restaurant that serves food like mom makes, so it's definitely food that's going to stick to your bones! It's set up booth style, so you can just walk in and pick your seat. My friend and I both got the cheesesteak sandwich based on the waitress' recommendation and it was very good!! The sandwich was also a good size and it came with fries. We also ordered the wings that are made to order, so they came out piping hot and were HUGE! We had the Buffalo Mild and Bourbon flavors which were both finger lickin' good! I am absolutely looking forward to coming back and trying the fried chicken (part of the Saturday daily special) and the lemon meringue pie."}
{"text":"I really wish we could do half stars; I would rate my visit 2.5. I went alone for lunch, walked in and waited a couple of minutes, then sat down at the entrance. Finally a girl came out and asked if I needed something. I wanted to say yeah, a table, but instead asked if I should seat myself. She said yes and handed me a menu. I guess the regulars know this, but a sign would have been nice.   I ordered the country style steak with fried squash and stewed okra and tomatoes. The steak was ok, but the gravy tasted canned. The squash reminded me of squash I used to get from a Bi-Lo deli when I worked nearby. It was heavily breaded and I prefer fried squash thin and lightly breaded, but it was the best part of the meal (besides the roll) so I finished it. The okra was a big disappointment. I expected it to be more tomatoey and stewey I guess, rather than a bowl of okra with a chunk or two of tomato. It was extremely under seasoned, if seasoned at all. At least the okra wasn't slimy. The roll was amazing and the cornbread was good enough to eat.   I tried to signal I was done by putting my napkin in my plate and playing on my phone, but my waitress walked right by me and sat down talking to some regulars. I wasn't annoyed by this until it lasted more than 5 minutes.  Even though I ate enough to not be hungry, I had to fight the urge to stop and get something else on the way home."}
{"text":"Simply put, the standards have gone down! Greasey spoon is a good descriptor. Place is dirty and management has given up. Just look at the grime on the chair backs. Even the waitress agreed the food was sub standard and she was embarasssed by it. Prices are low and should be!"}
{"text":"This place gets no better with time. I have visited here several times and it is nothing more than a greasy spoon, grease pit."}
{"text":"So my Charlotte hunt for a good \"NY Diner\" brought me here. A few of my fellow Elites have recommended this and swore by this particular location \"must go to Concord PKWY one\", since there are a few in town. Looking at the reviews, I was a bit skeptical, but hey, gotta try it once.  Boy-o-boy what a surprise. We ordered the house Philly cheeseteak, as recommended by our server. We also got an order of 10pc wings, split into Bourbon and their Mild sauce. We got served our orders pretty quickly!  The Philly cheesesteak was juicy and the the bread was crispy just right. Good mix of onions, peppers, cheese and mayo. Really enjoyed the recommendation. The fries were crispy, but not oily.  The wings were just a plate of drumsticks, which is always surprisingly. They are made to order, crispy almost double-fried, yet juicy tender meat. A real surprise. My friend I went with, said that they could compete with Wing Stop and the server noted that they give \"East Coast Wings\" a run for the money (note to self to try them out to compare).  They have a big menu and by the looks of the fellow patrons and staff feel like a home kitchen cooking you can taste! Definitely will come back to explore the menu some more.  They also have a homemade pie and cookie selection by the register, we were so full, we didn't even get to try it.  Atmosphere: A little bit dated interior, the leather on our seats were duct-taped together, but hey, I'm used to Hole-in-the-walls, so it was no biggie for me. Staff is friendly and attentive.  Lots of parking on site."}
{"text":"Food and service were both good.  Wasn't sure what to expect since the place just averages 3 stars on Yelp.  The menu is all over the place which is normally not a good sign.  You are talking homemade pizza, wings, hot and cold subs, vegetable plates, meat plates, sandwiches, hot dogs, burgers, salads, fish platters, speciality entrees, pasta, etc..  Good news is they will have something on the menu for everyone in your party.  However, I doubt they do all of it well.  So I went for one of the daily specials, grilled pork chops which came with two sides (your choice).  The pork chops were thin but you got two.  Very tasty.  The sides I selected were greens and green beans.  Both very good.  So I must have selected wisely and landed on some pretty good food.  I can't speak to the vast amount of other items on the menu.  Good luck with it.    Oh, the men's room was in pretty bad shape.  Water all over the floor by the urinal.  At least I think it was water."}
{"text":"Was highly disappointed with our meal.  Our large portions were more like small ones.  the Mac & cheese and pintos wasn't very tasty, they were very bland!  flounder was tasty but very skimpy on the portion size. The cashier also didn't give us a receipt.  Will not recommend to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"I entered this place for the first time ever on Friday even though it's close enough to my house to walk to! It was in the 6pm hour and it was not busy. The setting and ambiance is what you would expect and the menu straightforward. It was clean, comfortable and well-lit and our waitress was very sweet, humorous and attentive. The food and the sides were actually pretty delicious, home-cooked style and now I'm a fan. If you are looking for a nice, clean, friendly place to eat without spending a bunch of money, this place fits the bill. I would imagine that it's awfully crowded after churches let out. A place this side could run out of some menu items, especially if they are the daily special -- but there is plenty to choose from and our dinners that night were pretty tasty so I don't think you can go wrong. Try them too!"}
{"text":"This place has a wide variety of food, enough for everyone's tastes really.  We went in on a Saturday morning, the place was pretty busy but we got a table fairly quickly.   The food I had was good. Basic omelet with cheddar and some hash browns. My friend had grits which she said were yummy. I will take her word for it. NOOOO thank you!!  She had some eggs too, said everything was good on her end too!  The biscuits were yummy. Seriously. Not dry like they can be sometimes. Melt in your mouth goodness really. I noticed there was an ant crawling in my basket of butter/jelly and mentioned it to my waitress - I almost still ate the biscuit that was in the basket but the waitress was apparently more awake than I was & she stopped me! Brought me out another basket of butter/jelly & a biscuit quickly. I wouldn't have minded an extra free biscuit as an apology but nope. Just 1 for me. I was too full to eat more but would have gladly saved it for later!! :)  Our waitress was very friendly. Unfortunately we overheard another waitress being a bit rude to a nearby table & my friend overheard her say something she thought was racist. Thankfully she wasn't our server. We weren't 100% sure on what she said so we didn't mention anything but my friend was about to tell her off when we were leaving.   Prices were fairly cheap, food was good.  A good place to eat if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"I only come for breakfast but you can't beat the price and the southern home style breakfast options. Small town Diners are great!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and value! The meals are excellent and are reasonably priced. Service is friendly and quick. Great southern cooking."}
{"text":"Just went to Parkway House for the first time this weekend and boy was it good! I got the penne pasta with creamy tomato sauce and it was delicious, as was the salad that came with it. Everything here is made to order and you can definitely tell by the quality. I was too stuffed to have dessert but they have some of the best looking pies! And the servers are extremely friendly and attentive - our drinks never came close to being empty. Can't wait to try out one of their other locations!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Concord for almost three weeks and I've been here three separate times.  Twice I've gone for dinner, once I had the fried chicken special and once the stuffed peppers.  It reminds me of basic meals I could make at home, but it's good, no complaints on the food.  It does seem like they could have more waitresses at busy times as all three times I've been the service is sporadic.  The third time I went, my family and I went for breakfast.  It was okay, nothing spectacular.  I had the biscuit & gravy, eggs, bacon and hashbrowns.  Everything was good, nothing really stood out and the gravy didn't have a whole lot of flavor, I think it needed salt & pepper and maybe some other seasonings.  I'll go back, but for a Family Restaurant, I'd rather go to Marvin's in Mt. Pleasant."}
{"text":"You know even McDonald's have breakfast all day so I go there about 11am sat for breakfast I order coffee and I find out I can't get breakfast ( I just got out the hospital ) she looks down her nose at me (shes a older redhead ) and says you dontt have to pay for the coffee like I'm a bum !!! I was so embarrassed I can't go back now I have been there before the foods OK but I'm not gonna be insulted I'm mad AF"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. Will not order grits again. Grits served with a spoon. I asked the waitress if they ever serve them with a straw at which time she offered to get me one. Had wheat toast which was hard as a rock. Server very sweet but lacking in service ability. Bacon was delish...thoroughly cooked and not burnt. Eggs were cooked as ordered."}
{"text":"I came in for a pick up order for a few sides to eat with dinner. The fried okra were cooked to perfection. The collards tasted a bit off to me, but I'm from the country so my standards are pretty high.   I'll definitely have to come back another time to get a full meal. Then I will be able to give you a full review."}
{"text":"Food is wonderful, nice size portions for a fair price.  Hot foods are served piping hot and salad was a little too chilled for my liking.  Dessert looked wonderful but too full it eat any.  Staff is super efficient and friendly."}
