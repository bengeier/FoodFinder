{"text":"Have been for breakfast or brunch quite a few times. Stumbled on this place my chance and I don't regret it. Menu items are vast and everything I have ordered so far has been delicious. The first few times I came I was served by a gentleman who was kind and attentive.  Today, the server was not so great but the food was good as always"}
{"text":"First time trying out this place, beyond my expectation for the quality of food served here! It deserves a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"After following Cliffside Bistro on Instagram for a few weeks, I HAD to go. The food looked incredible and they kept taunting me with their address being literally down the street from where I live. Procrastinating could no longer hold me back. It was time to brunch at Cliffside!   Upon entering, I felt a little underdressed. It's very nice. Freshly painted walls, classy accents and leather seating made me feel a little out of place in running shoes and a hoodie. Alas, we sat and browsed the menu. I would not have guessed the pricing would be so reasonable. I thought it was going to be on the pricey side, but I was pleasantly surprised. I went with the Egg Portobello($10.99) and my friend chose the Grilled Veggie Sandwich($10). This, I was dressed for. ;)   The Egg Portobello was tasty. Why I chose it over Eggs Benny, was that they were on potato pancakes. I love potato pancakes! These were thin and not as crispy as I'd like. I've always had them with some onion mixed in, but the smoked sausage, mushrooms and hollandaise sauce made everything better. The homefries and salad were great. Loved the house dressing! My friend's Veggie sandwich was stuffed with avocado, roasted red peppers, goat cheese and portobello mushrooms. Those fries though. She 'made' me eat them. I did. No regrets.   The coffee was so good, I think my friend drank a whole pot. She definitely asked our server what brand it was. He said customers ask about it a lot! Our server was fabulous. He handled a couple overly caffeinated ladies just fine. I'd love to come back for dinner, so I can stop being teased by their Instagram!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal. Dropped in on a chance and was very surprised. This place should be busier. The food and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Cliffside is a great brunch spot anytime. My friends and i go almost every weekend, especially after a night out.   Food: the food is incredible. Ive been there plenty of times and have ordered alot of different things on the menu and loved every one of them... The homefries are amazing. They fry them with onions and peppers, and it tasted incredible. The pancakes are also great, especially with blueberries :).   They also have weekender specials which are such a great deal for food you normally wouldnt get at a standard bruch spot.   Location: right off kingston road, decent sized parking pot and easily accessable by transit.   Atmosphere: very casual, relaxing place. Great for a date spot or bruch with friends.  Price: price is perfect for what you get. Standard breakfast is under $10. And i dont think there is many things that jump above $20 on the brunch menu.   Go eat here... Do it."}
{"text":"Went once for dinner and the food was decent, but they forgot our coffee and tea, and also gave us creme brule that was terrible. It was runny, hadn't set at all, was boiling hot, and the brule was still sugar.  Then today, I ordered breakfast through UberEATS, and it showed a delivery time of 10:07am. Suddenly, at 10:12, the restaurant cancels my order. Why accept it in the first place? We were ready and waiting at the table, and then suddenly got a cancellation from the restaurant so I had to get up and cook. Unacceptable.  It's really a hit and miss--both food and service. Unfortunate, since it had the potential to be really good with very good food."}
