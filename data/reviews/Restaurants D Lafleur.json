{"text":"Real fast food, greasy and full of fat. It's the only place where I'll always pick the hot dog over the hamburger (their burgers aren't that good actually). The Hot dog's and fries/poutines... My god heaven.  If you're looking for \"classic\" fast food that hasn't been tainted, or tried to become \"healthy\" this is the place.   It's greasy, full of fat and awfully delicious."}
{"text":"While experiencing Montreal, I saw a sign for Poutine. After falling in love with the gravy and cheesey goodness, i set on a mission to try different places that serve Poutine.   Not the fanciest place in the slightest, seems to me its like a McDonalds of some sort. I order a few various varieties of Poutine, some were a bit whierd to me. Like the spaghetti sauce one, but all in all, this place is serviceable for a quick Poutine fix."}
{"text":"Lafleur est un classique ! Leurs Poutine est excellent avec de bonne frites fraiches et croustillantes du fromage en grain frais et une bonne sauce pas trop épaisse mais juste assez pour enrobé les frites ! Le service est très bon et ils ont même des Tofu-Dogs et des Végé Burgers c'est définitivement un plus ! Les prix sont dans la moyenne des casse croûte."}
{"text":"It takes either a spectacularly good or spectacularly bad place for me to bother reviewing it. This was the latter. Inedible even for fast food. They put at least 1/4 cup of mayonnaise on my veggie burger- both sides of the bun. Vile. They certainly don't skimp on the amount of fries they give you, but they were all soggy and didn't even resemble something that had been fried. They were just a big pile of soggy mess (a really big pile, but more of something horrible isn't really a benefit). They tasted awful and I had to throw away most of them. And throwing away french fries is a tragedy. But not with these.  I can't imagine where the other reviewers were eating, but this place is just terrible."}
{"text":"I personally love this place  They make great bog standard hot dogs, poutines, fries.  Its the totally standard quebecois casse croute food I do really enjoy.    Love the fries.  Yes the buns+weiners are plastic, and so is the gravy, but its kind of the same everywhere isn't it?   I'm into it."}
{"text":"This is what La Belle Province is *trying to be.  While the Lafleur franchise is not nearly as large as La Belle, their steamies, michigans, burgers, and poutines are all much better. Their quality control across locations is also better, and this location reflects that.  Definitely a great place to grab a quick, greasy bite if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Essential eating for any visit to Montréal. I don't know if there is better poutine in this city, but I'd be perfectly content to eat only Lafleur poutine everyday for the rest of my life. Seriously, if you visit Montréal and do not eat poutine, you'd be better off not visiting all--there's scarcely any point."}
{"text":"The same taste and quality from when I was a kid. Great service! Very clean! Still the best fries in Montreal."}
{"text":"This is the first place I ever experienced poutine as a child. This stuff is DELICIOUS.   ::mouth water::  I have never poutine better than I remember eating it from here, so, just for that, Lafleur earns five stars. If you're ever in Montreal, make sure to stop in and clog up those purdy arteries."}
{"text":"I thought this place used to be much more run down.  I'm pretty sure they've done some renos.  It looks like any other fast food resto with booths and such.  It's too bad they only have one cash open, a huge line, and this giant wraparound space to pick up your order which really could've been more efficiently designed.    The poutine here is good.  The cheese could be squeakier.    I'm not into steamies.    They sell Pogos too."}
{"text":"Honestly. I used to be all about la belle province and this place is legit that times 100. Best Poutine i have ever had. Don't let the exterior fool you. This is our go to spot in Montreal."}
{"text":"When u have the munchies you'll eat pretty much anything right?! Well... This is what anything taste like. Dry patties, almost no condiments in burgers. I guess they can make ok hot dogs. I'll stick to that next time I'm up at 2am"}
{"text":"This place gets a solid 3 stars.  This Lafleur Restaurant is one of a chain of local restaurants that feature what is apparently Québécois fast food (at least according to their wiki entry): hamburgers, hot dogs, fries and POUTINE. Having never had poutine, I was excited to try for the first time. This location is on the smaller side and maybe 4 feet below street level, which makes for an interesting people-watching perspective of passers-by.  I ordered a combo of two hot dogs and upgraded to a small serving of poutine. The hot dogs were in a type of bun that I have never before seen in my life: like two top ends of a slice of bread on the sides, but whole on the bottom and a perfect encasement for said hot dog. No complaints on the h-dogs.  The poutine: It was alright. Definitely a healthy portion, but I guess I was looking for a little more flavor! Perhaps it's the gravy that is a little lackluster -- not really sure. The cheese curds are interesting -- they partially melt after awhile under the gravy.  Overall, the food was good, filling, inexpensive. They also have vegetarian options (veggie burger, veggie hot dog), which I give them additional kudos for."}
{"text":"If you've never been to Lafleur on St Denis it isn't much to look at. Sure it has a great corner location across from historic Carre St Louis, but the Lafleur chain's green and white colour scheme - albeit fresh and new - mark this place as a slightly unappealing fast food resto from another time. Inside it's all tile and arborite surfaces. It's clean and neat in a 'don't stick around too long' kind of way. At night - your most likely time to visit - it is over lit and a shock to eyes that may have a hard time adjusting due to the influence of strong drink.   Your first impression as you get up to the order counter may be that the staff are sad barely legal youths with bad skin and goofy grins, chafing under their polyester uniforms. But this is where Lafleur starts to get interesting. We've all seen the teenage fast food worker at various burger places doing a slap dash hash of their simple tasks. We've seen the eye rolls, the dopey faces, the disinterest, the pure boredom. But not here. These youth are god-damn fast food heroes. They always seem super friendly, (they look out from behind the counter with a smile that says \"I know you are loaded and we are here to take care of you.\") they seem like they enjoy their work, and they perform with an above-and-beyond-the-call-of-duty joie de vivre.   Because at 3am when the place fills with drunken idiots, and the line snakes to the front door, these Lafleur employees become hot-dog and fries ninjas. The kitchen is an open square, and you can see all the action. Even at the busiest times, the cashier/poutine operative will drop back and smash a couple dozen freshly peeled potatoes through a giant potato slicer. The others work the back area, flat top grill, hot dot vat, and most importantly the bun steamer. There is not enough time in the day to discuss the age old debate over toasted bun or steamed bun - suffice to say, whatever your preference, they make a great dog.  My standard is a steamie all dressed. Which to those outside of Quebec means it comes on a steamed bun, with a pickley cabbage slaw, and mustard. The slaw makes the Quebec dog a superior food. The fresh veggie crunch balances the salty nitrate soaked meat tube perfectly and (maybe I go too far but) lends it an air of health.   The fries are great, the poutine is always surprisingly tasty. I can't vouch for anything else. And before someone gets bent out of shape - I have eaten here totally stone cold sober on several occasions - just so you know.   I would say Lafleur was a cultural institution, but that would be doing it a great disservice. Culture institutions are often past their prime, resting on their laurels and generally more curiosity than quality. Lafleur and their employees seem to care about what they do and for that they get five stars.    I refer those interested to the following rundown on the Montreal dog.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_hot_dog"}
{"text":"I liked Lafleur.  It may seem dated but that's nostalgic in my books.  Kind of how many La Belle Province still look a little stuck in time this place is a bit so what?  The food is ok and it's a quick place to get a bite.   Hot dogs?  Poutine?  That's a magical combo yes?  If you're looking for a quick fast meal and you feel like having fast food I'd rather come here than McDonald's and yes they also have smoked meat and burgers too.    Just remember trio = combo (fries, drink) but dont' forget about poutine."}
{"text":"What people need to know is that Lafleur's is vegan friendly. They deserve five stars for that. I have stopped off at Lafleur's multiple times after the bar at 3AM for a late night snack. Each time I was blown away by my meal of fries (best in the city) and veggie dogs. But anything greasy taste good after a few gin and tonics right?   Last night after playing softball, my husband and I went through the drive through and I ordered a veggie all dressed hot dog and fries. The guy on the intercom sounded a little surprised at first followed by a confident and enthusiastic oui, on a des veggie dogs!!! My husband ordered poutine which I don't eat for moral reasons but I could sense it was delicious.   Wow, first time eating the tofu dog sober and let me tell you it's the most delicious veggie dog on the planet. I don't know how they do it but you really feel like you are eating a real hot dog. At first I even questioned whether it's just a big Lafleur's conspiracy - marketing them as veggie dogs but  secretly feeding us cow bits... don't worry not true. There is no hot doggie aftertaste. So I know it's made from plants.   I also love the way Lafleur's has resisted the urge to employ overzealous plastic packaging.  My husband and I were each given an elegant unassuming green and white cardboard box. The clever cardboard clasps on the sides keep the boxes shut with crafty precision. No plastic bag. No individually wrapped forks. Instead, my fork was graciously placed next to my fries with a little white napkin underneath. Classy. Unless you are an astronaut flying to new galaxies, why do you need your fork individually wrapped in plastic? The answer is you don't."}
{"text":"There is a lot of hate on here for this place because it's as fast food chain can be...  But the poutine and the hot dogs are just great.  The poutine had good gravy and cheese, and was piping hot. The hot dog had a nice steamed bun and a good relish slaw on top.   Don't go to the fancy places - just try some poutine here. It's great!"}
{"text":"Normalement je ne suis pas très copine avec les fast-foods (Mc Donald mis à part, mais c'est une histoire d'amour qui remonte à si longtemps...!). Mais j'avoue que pour Lafleur, je fais une exception. Je ne connais pas d'autres resto Lafleur que celui du carré St-Louis, alors cette revue ne vaut que pour celui-ci. Je ne suis fan ni de leurs burgers, ni de leurs hotdogs, combien même ceux-là seraient végétariens, végétaliens ou quoique ce soit d'autre. Non, clairement mes burgers je les prends toujours chez Buns. Mais justement, en revenant de Buns, je fais un léger détour par Lafleur pour... leurs frites! Car elles valent littéralement le détour! (c'est le cas de dire!) Par moments -j'avoue-  j'en mange même pour mon 4 heures! Juste comme ça, sans rien d'autre. Enfin ci, une petite mayonnaise maison faite avec une moutarde cognac-noisettes que je trouve chez IGA et qui déchire tout. Bref, le repas spécial grand froid qui rivalise avec une poutine! D'ailleurs ça me fait penser qu'il parait que leur poutine est pas mal non  plus... Je vous fais signe, dès que j'ai testé!"}
{"text":"This place is a throw back to another time. An ugly time from the 70's and 80's. They haven't changed, but they should. I've often felt like I'm in a prison cafeteria waiting for my portion of food. And if you've been here late enough you even feel like you might have to fight to keep your food!"}
{"text":"This place is total fast food and normally I stay far, far away from fast food.  That is of course, unless I see the words tofu and/or vegetarian on the menu.  AWESOME.  We ordered tofu dogs and vegetarian poutine.  I have to admit that the veggie dogs were so real (ok, so I haven't eaten a real hot dog in about 14 years so they probably weren't but hey...) that I got freaked out for a second.   I had regular fries, while my husband got the poutine, fries with brown gravy and cheese curds.  Both were hand cut fries.  For fast food this place is pretty awesome, and pretty damn cheap too.  We spent about $10 for three veggie dogs, an order of poutine, regular fries and two drinks.  Not too shabby."}
{"text":"Restaurent propre. Les frites sont très bonnes. Peu de sel (Y). Les portions sont généreuses. De plus, les employées sont amicales. Tout pour un repas réussie!"}
{"text":"Three stars. Sometimes I feel like it should be more like four, given its extreme convenience and marked superiority to La Belle Province, but this is not the place to subject to rating inflation. It's fast food at its finest, and it'll survive even if it doesn't have shaved truffles and gold leaf on it. The all-dressed hot dog was pretty mediocre, but the poutine was awesome. The guy behind the counter was gregarious, to say the least. The décor is so out-there, it's almost a parody of trashy Montréal casse-croûte. Good enough to dine at while sober, convenient enough to stumble into while hammered."}
{"text":"Not exactly the best place to come for a burger and fries...my burger was dry, tasteless, it had the texture of cardboard...and the fries were soggy, and almost burnt, I would not be surprised if they were reheated...Lafleur for me is a one-time thing...been there...never coming back."}
{"text":"Lfleur is a Montreal-based chain that specializes in Quebécois fast food. It isn't fancy, but the poutine at LaFleur is the real deal. The fries are squishy and swimming in way too much gravy, the cheese curds are clearly high fat and most aren't even melted, and the whole thing is so obviously unhealthy that I'm afraid to finish it (but cant stop). In other words, all is as it should be.  :)   There are tons of places in Montreal that will top poutine with additional items such as bacon or Montreal's famous smoked meat, and the really fancy bistros will add more high-falluting ingredients like green peppercorns or even fois gras.  But my favourite will always be the unadulterated kind found at LaFleur."}
{"text":"I was craving a burger and this hit the spot perfectly. I got the Lafleur Burger in a meal. It came with a decent serving of fries tho they were unseasoned and a bit oily. Otherwise, great fast meal!"}
{"text":"Not exactly comparable to a real casse croute steamie and poutine but it does the job!  Lafleur's has always been consistent in its food as they use fresh cut potatoes and loads of real Quebec curd cheese with brown gravy on their poutines. The steamies are every bit as good as I remember them.  Again, not at la Banquise level for the poutine and not at Montreal Pool Room level for the dogs but it will do the job any day with consistency."}
{"text":"good fast food--a decent poutine for a decent price and pretty much your typical greasy food menu (burgers, fries, etc). quick and reliable and just a block away from sherbrooke metro station!"}
