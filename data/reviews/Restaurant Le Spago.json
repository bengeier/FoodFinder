{"text":"Found this little gem after spending the day skiing. Very happy with the food and drinks. The escargot was AMAZING. We were a group of 4 and found the portion was a little small. The pasta is a little dry so if you like it with a lot of sauce make sure to order it on the side."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian fare, nice terrace, friendly servers. Just generally a good experience. Will go back in the future."}
