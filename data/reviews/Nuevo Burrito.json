{"text":"Placed my order for a chorizo and egg burrito, sat for about two minutes, and my order was ready.  Thought it was good since I thought they had excess food prepped and just warmed it up.  Got home, popped in a movie, settleled in and took a bite,  not a good taste then i notoced that it was partially cooked.  Tossed it trash. First and last visit."}
{"text":"Here's to my lucky first review. The best Mexican food I've had in quite some time. I would strongly recommend this restaurant, if you're looking for some authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Great Food. Great Service. One of the best places I have been too which has authentic Mexican food. I tried their machaca con huevo and their bistec in red chile and it was amazing. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Food was great, it's a small little restaurant.  They charge for credit card use also the outside it's filthy they really need to clean up."}
{"text":"I was in this part of town and looked it up on yelp.  OMG this place is awesome!!!  Homemade tortillas, everything is fresh.
I had the carne asada burrito.  Definitely coming back.  Not a lot of atmosphere but the food rocks."}
{"text":"This is definately good food :) 
 Pleasant customer service :) 
Very clean place (plain but nice) 
Clean kitchen 
Those are my four stars. 
Didn't get 5 th star because tv is on spanish, not everyone wants to watch spanish, Wich happens often in Arizona"}
{"text":"REAL TRADITIONAL MEXICAN FOOD! Customer service was GREATE! Restaurant maintains CLEAN! Variety selection on there menu. Most definitely recommend friends and family to eat here."}
{"text":"First time here and I will not by going back. I got 2 carne asada tacos and a side of beans to go. If I am ordering brand to go you would think they would be put in a separate container. Nope! Beans everywhere they were all over my taco and by the time I got home my taco was soggy. To top it off the taco didn't have any flavor. And they don't even give you a lime for your tacos."}
{"text":"First time at this Resturant. Excellent  burrito which I got cooked like a chimichanga then served enchilada style with a red sauce. Very tasty. Re fried beans probably the best I've had. Although I didn't have any additional tortillas, someone in the kitchen was constantly making them fresh."}
{"text":"Chilaquiles were amazing! Very clean, everything made fresh and from scratch. Definitly coming back!"}
{"text":"Super awesome family run joint. They have the Best breakfast burritos. NOT overly salted, well balanced, freshly made. Service was great, friendly and not too invasive."}
{"text":"We found this place by reading Yelp reviews and I'm glad we gave it a try..  located in a hole in the wall This is a very small setting environment so if you go on a Sunday like we did go when they first open. They make homemade corn and flour tortillas and they are super yummy! This is authentic Mexican food if your looking for food like macayo's or Garcia's this is not for you..this place serves up the homemade beans to menudo. And the moms to grandmas are cooking in the kitchen. The only disappointment was the limited seating and they don't serve lengua. We had the menudo which I like white they only had red and machaca con huevos and jamon con huevos and our boys got cheese crisp with rice and beans. Overall I walked out full and satisfied. I would come back!"}
{"text":"Ordered pancakes to go along with a side of refried beans to accompany the eggs & ham we already had in the office. The pancakes we big & fluffy & delicious, they really look like the picture on the poster. Beans were yummy too, cheese melted on top. Staff was friendly, service was fast & they even held the door open for me when I left."}
{"text":"I liked this placed before like 2 years ago everything tasted way way better and then my husband and I went to eat menudo one Sunday and it was nasty. Then my husband decided to give it another try and everything changed even their logo... We never went back and have heard from other friends that they stopped going too.. NASTY FOOD"}
{"text":"I gave them a 2 for there service which was good but their food was not. Our party of 3 each got burritos, 1 chorizo and eggs, 1 chicken, 1 pastor and all of them were runny and watery. We each had stomach aches after, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"So good. The beans and rice are so flavorful and the red sauce is tasty. Tortas are good. Ladies here know how to cook :-)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome they have a wonderful Chile relleno burrito spectacular rice and beans everything is made with pride and care. It is a small place and closes early but well worth adding to places to eat Mexican food at.Service is great and you can call ahead to pick up your food. A must try location reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Good food, great family restaurant, but a little dissgusting when the waitress was wearing a shirt that was showing her belly ring..The other waiter looked like she had just woken up from a night of heavy partying and never had a chance to put on descent clothes to come in to work.."}
{"text":"When I don't want to cook this is my go to place. They hand make their tortillas! The Costillas as are the best!"}
{"text":"Hace un momento fui a ese lugar a comer,había cinco órdenes adelante de la mía supuestamente eran de puros menudos, tuve que esperar una hora para que me sirvieran mi comida jajajajaja,tardaron una hora para servir dos menudos alas personas que estaban antes que yo ,es un servicio de lo peor no recomiendo ese lugar ,así para cuando el encargado se quiere ahorrar dinero en empleados solo tiene dos personas cocinando  por ahorrarse dinero,lo que le va a pasar es que va a perder dinero,porque no todas las personas somos tan pacientes como 'para esperar una hora para que te sirvan un plato de menudo y 40 minutos para que te entreguen un burrito Jajajaja es una falta de respeto jamás volveré a ese lugar"}
{"text":"Solid burritos, friendly staff  and nice clean locale. Had a custom made burrito. The only problem I had was the salsa wasn't hot enough for me but other than that a good experience."}
{"text":"We found this little spot when we were searching yelp for enchiladas. It turned out to be a very good find. Everything is fresh and the price is great. We're DEFINITELY coming back on a frequent flyer plan."}
{"text":"Had the Pastor Torta and it was great. The pastor was flavorful and not ovetcooked like most places. Very clean and sweet service, will be back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is the real deal authentic Mexican food don't let the little place fool you bold flavors cooked to order great customer service"}
{"text":"Always professional service. Wide variety of options , drinks, and they also have coffee."}
{"text":"Most authentic homemade Mexican food I have found around Phoenix. Worth making the drive. The quality is excellent, service is great."}
{"text":"We love the chilliquiles!  The red is our favorite. The staff are very friendly and always accommodating.  Don't let the location fool you. The food is delicious."}
{"text":"Ok...I guess first time here ordered breakfast burrito pretty small and tortilla was burnt"}
