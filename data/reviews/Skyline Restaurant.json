{"text":"Pretty good brunch option in Parkdale for a decent price.  $12 will get you a full meal and a coffee. The servers are really nice and attentive. 

The vegan brunch is yummy. The tofu scrambled was cooked to perfection and I am in love with avocado so was thrilled that it was included.

The only bad thing is it's tough to eat here if you are gluten-free. My gluten-free friend couldn't have the toast and they weren't willing to substitute which is disappointing. He left hungry. hard to believe there are places who outright refuse substitutes.

Overall: a reasonable place to visit on a weekend morning."}
{"text":"We're so disappointed again. We want this to be our amazing local diner for brunch. But each time we give it another shot we leave more upset. The challah french toast is literally two pieces of bread for the price tag of $12! The first time we had it we sent it back because it was literally dry inside. This past visit we sent scrambled eggs back twice. There were so overcooked and dry that they were inedible. Interestingly the steamed scrambled eggs we ordered for our baby were perfect. Do that instead! This isn't a challenging thing to cook or menu so we keep scratching our heads as to why they can't get it right. It's expensive to begin with, which we are happy to support but the quality is awful. New chef is needed immediately! Or the kitchen needs to slow down. Staff are lovely and decor is as charming as ever but come on skyline, be better!"}
{"text":"BEST.BURGER.EVER.
Great fries, super friendly servers, adorable restaurant, but the freshly ground patty is dripping with meat juice, had a perfect meat-to-bun ratio, the bun was soft, the fries are thin and perfect texture. Change nothing! So sooo good, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very quaint little place, I'm used to a quick, no nonsense diner meal back where I'm from and I was very impressed with the quality of food and the service. I'll probably be getting breakfast here tomorrow morning too, before I leave."}
{"text":"I usually never write reviews but this was probably the worst experience I have EVER had at a restaurant. Our server was an elderly gentleman (quite possibly the owner) who was grumpy and extremely rude. He basically threw the menus at us when we sat down. He came over 10 minutes later, and we said were ready to order. He told us we would have to wait to place our order because it was too busy at the moment. (There was literally two other tables with single guests) and then he told us we could only order our drinks. A little strange....but okay. We (there was four of us) all ordered coffee. When he came back with our coffee, I asked for some extra milk (because I like more than one milk pod for mine). He got pissed off, walked off and screamed something like 'So you want a glass of milk then!' He then proceeded to go get me a glass of milk....came back and slammed it on the table. (I never asked or ordered milk, I just wanted a few extra milk pods).

When he took our order, I was so flustered by the milk situation, that I realized after we walked away that he never asked how we wanted our eggs cooked. He didn't ask what type of bread we wanted either or any of the standard questions servers usually ask at a breakfast restaurant. When I approached him after, he said \"If you don't tell me how you want your eggs cooked, we give you over easy\" and rudely walked away. What kind of server does not ask how you want your breakfast eggs cooked and then assumes everyone likes over easy?

In the end, we ate our breakfast quickly and left as fast as we could. He even had the nerve to charge me for the glass of milk (that I never even ordered). When I pointed out that I actually never ordered it, he got angry. 

I have never experienced such rudeness in my life at a restaurant. We are paying customers and were more than polite from the time we sat down until we left. As a former waitress myself for many years, I understand customer service and know how important it is to a customer's dining experience. We should have got up and left the moment he threw our menus at us. 

Never, ever going back. I'm shocked other people who have reviewed have commented on their good service."}
{"text":"There's plastic flowers, classical radio, heavy paper bills. When you walk into Skyline you walk into Parkdale. Former glory, contemporary good sense. It feels homely and the kinds of simple place where there's no need to pretend. Sit on the vinyl booth, order a tasty breakfast or other 'Canadian' food and read your paper. The main waitress, a charming lady that is a template of professional waitress will be right there. 

One thing I enjoyed the most is their old fashion bar. With a friend of mine, no doubt influenced by the TV serie Mad Men, order a whisky on the rocks at 11am; and cheered sliently to a pleasant day. 

But this is also Parkdale, and there might be some characters in there too. It's real here, what else can I say? Nod pleasantly and go about your business, no one will bother you, if you don't want to.

And take a stroll to Parkdale after. West of Dufferin is probably one of the most burgeoning area in Toronto. This is Queen West before the brand."}
{"text":"I loved this place in the old days when I lived in Parkdale. (early 2000s). It had all the charm you want from an old school diner. 

The new (younger) owners had a difficult balancing act of keeping the charm while raising the level of service and offerings. They've done a great job doing that. It's nice to see this place bustling and busy again. Well done!"}
{"text":"Today, my wife and I stopped in for lunch at the Skyline Restaurant on Queen Street in Parkdale. She had heard it had good food and was an old fashioned style diner.

Walking in was much like stepping into the past. It is not so much of a diner but an old style restaurant that I remember my family going to way back in the 60's. In fact our server said that the Skyline opened sometime in the 60's. The place is very well kept, spotless and again, looks like it would have opening day, decades ago.

The menus seem new also, again spotlessly clean. We were in burger moods and asked what the difference was between a burger and a home burger. The burger is frozen and the home burger is freshly made. My wife had the home burger and I went for a banquet home burger, which comes with lettuce, onion, cheese, bacon, a pickle and a tomato which I gave to my wife. I don't like tomatoes and she loves them 

It was a good hearty burger and delicious. My wife enjoyed hers too.

This is a quaint, old school place to eat. It's not fancy but I would not have a problem ordering anything off the menu."}
{"text":"Greasy old style diner with very affordable prices. The place has lots of character including the wonderful retro sign outside the store and the old 60s decor. I doubt much has changed, and the cooking style, the menu, plastic decorations, old music, utensils, everything feels from a bygone era. The waiters have been there for a while and know their stuff, so don't mess around.

When it comes to eating, one word describes it all - cheap! Breakfasts (few eggs, bacon, toast, coffee, potatoes) cost next to nothing, infact it gets cheaper on weekend mornings (before 11 think). Great value for sure.

Parkdale is rapidly undergoing hipsterification and every once in a while when you have craving for no-nonsense service, basic non-gourmet food and the satisfaction of getting out of a restaurant without burning a hole in your pocket, stop by here!"}
{"text":"Do you remember when Tim Hortons had a bar area with bar stools (and it was spelled Tim Horton's)? They didn't serve booze, but you'd always find neighbourhood men planted on the stools, reading the paper, chain smoking and talking with the ladies behind the counter.

The Skyline takes me back to my childhood in this respect. The regulars here are from the few seniors residences in the area. The servers (and most likely owners) are friendly and seem to know everyone who walks through the doors. 

The furniture, including booths and one awkward little table near the bar, is far older than most people reading this review. The wear on the table tops comes from years of hearty meals served fast. The regulars probably made many of the scratches themselves, literally etching themselves into the history of the place.

We were there for brunch. Service was quick and serving sizes are plentiful. Brunch classics are all on the menu and while you're there to let a little grease sop up your hangover anyways, take some time to soak in the aura, share your childhood memories with your friends and plan the rest of your day."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to visit. This is an old school diner that is not pretending to be anything else. I adore having breakfast here on the weekend. My friend and I spend Saturday morning fitted into the red vinyl booth having the most amazing homestyle breakfast with endless coffee - all in 20 dollars with tip. 

What I really love about the place is the owner. He knows his customers and treats them all well. Smiles are endless, attitude is non-existent. What a pleasure!"}
{"text":"Had their classic breakfast. It's a solid, inexpensive classic diner breakfast in Parkdale. Really neat atmosphere inside as well. Definitely nail the vintage diner vibe, but not in an obnoxious way.

I just wish they opened earlier :)"}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant ! Les plats ne sont pas très chers et vraiment savoureux. Mention spéciale pour la tarte au chocolat qui nous a transportés. 
Le service était rapide et Les serveuses agréables et à l'écoute. 

Une belle surprise en somme !"}
{"text":"Great brunch for the price and good service. We liked the vintage booths. Apparently it was closed and reopened. This is for the reopened spot."}
{"text":"I have been sick all day from what they describe as eggs.

I get that a chef will want to put their own spin on things... this is why I go to independent places.  I ordered eggs over-easy and got eggs sunny side up.  I asked and was told they don't do over easy... they just cook the sunny side up longer because they use a pan than doesn't allow them to flip the eggs.  Texture is something that is key to me and what was presented was revolting.  

Tough spot... the sever was polite but condescending \"(I'm sorry you don't like it that way\") and the place is $15 plate of eggs."}
{"text":"I love the Skyline! It is one of my go to places in the neighborhood and was back when it was owned by the nice Greek family. I eat there about once a week. Daily specials are always changing and they have repeats like spaghetti night and steak night.  I love that they post the daily specials on Instagram. Great Caesar salad, wicked good fries and a solid clubhouse all from the regular menu.

The staff are always friendly giving this place a great vibe.

Easily one of my favourite places to eat in Parkdale."}
{"text":"Love the Skyline! It's been my neighbourhood local since I moved in a year ago. New management is doing a stellar job continuing to feed the locals with diner classics and new menu items like fresh local fish, mussels, steak and a really nice wedgie salad.  Nice crispy fries!

Friendly, attentive staff. Laid back vibe. You can always find a spot at a table or the bar! Daily specials."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant at the Lodge in Mt. Magazine state park. Local beer (soon draft) great service. Very accommodating"}
{"text":"Customer service is horrendous. I ordered steak and eggs and the steak was cook poorly, eggs were too runny, when I asked for it to be cooked over easy. breakfast is the most important and easiest meal to cook, yet they do such a shitty job. 

I'm a huge foodie and this place is absolutely bad. Will never step foot in here again for breakfast. 

Don't tell me it's a dollar extra for a substitution 5 mins after I ordered my food. Sorry. I can afford to pay but I won't. Huslting like this ain't right. POOR SERVICEEEEE."}
{"text":"Looks sort of dingy on the outside, but inside its great. Very cozy and clean. The server was a pro, the food tasty, and the prices fair."}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend before our adventure to High Park for the afternoon. Restaurant itself is very cute. Very unique in terms of decor. We both ordered a cheeseburger, and it tasted pretty good. Nothing to brag about. The condiments (red onion, pickles, tomatoes, lettuce, mayo) were all standard - no caramelized onions or anything like that. If you're looking for a simple burger, this is your place. As for service, it was good. Food came out fairly quickly."}
{"text":"I love me a good greasy spoon diner, and Skyline was just that (sans the literal greasy spoons).

Word has it the owners of this diner purchased a neighborhood staple, gave a quick spit shine, enhanced the menu with some more elevated diner offerings, and added a full bar program for the modern eater. If I had large sums of money lying around to buy a diner and put my own spin on it, I'd probably do the exact same thing. It really seems like the (North) American dream. 

Lots of room to spread out with a large group, and a whole lot of tasty menu offerings to satisfy all palates. I opted for the turkey salad club sandwich, and though the turkey salad was a little drier than I imagined it'd be, it was still a lovely first meal of the early afternoon. Their Caesar, however, was perfect, and the service was as friendly as can be. 

If I lived in Toronto, it'd certainly be an easy option for a no frills meal, whether that meal is breakfast, lunch, or dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent service - The gentleman was attentive, approachable, and funny!
Great food - Had the Smelts, Burger, Coconut Cream Pie, and Fried Chicken. 
Awesome Decor - So amazing and retro! They did a great job restoring and keeping the charm of the place. I actually couldn't stop staring at all the little details!"}
{"text":"Well it would probably help if they had more than one wait staff that knew what they were doing ( we unfortunately didn't get her), the other two just stood around talking about how much better the job was than the office jobs they used to do. The order we received was all mixed up and the food wasn't very well cooked. I not sure how you screw up eggs, but the guy in the kitchen with a beard and no net did just that. It took me standing up to get our wait staffs attention, in order to fix the order mix up. It's nice when people save old landmark places but it would be even better if they hired people who knew what they were doing."}
{"text":"This place has a different menu everyday, and it's posted up on their instagram! So it's hard to give a review on this place after only trying it out twice. 

I really liked this place for breakfast. I remember having the grilled cheese, and a typical breakfast. It was lovely for a slight hangover. Greasy enough, but didn't make you feel more filth. 

The late night/dinner menu was okay those times we went. It wasn't very memorable for me.

The place is very cute and service is nothing to complain about. 

Will definitely go back and update this review over time."}
{"text":"Burger and fries were great. Nice atmosphere, but a little hot when we went around noon. I wouldn't order the avocado toast again. It was $7 for one piece of toast with maybe a 1/3 of an avocado and a plate full of plain lettuce with no dressing."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time since the management changed, and was pleasantly surprised.  Service was fine, menu modified only slightly, but where it was, it has been improved without altering the fact that it is still, first and foremost, a diner, with nice subtle improvements to the décor.  Most importantly, the food quality has gone up a notch, the bacon and bread are of better quality, and everything we ordered came with a mini arugula salad on the plate, which is a step up from your standard parsley sprig/orange slice garnish.

We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food, old school atmosphere, and super friendly service. Had an 11 month old with me and we were warmly welcomed. Love the piano in the back!! Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"They had a dip platter for sharing that had an amazingly good squash one. The other two dips and the fried pita were good but this was so smooth and subtle that one of our group resorted to scooping the last of  it out with her finger. 
Veggie burger really squishy and tasted solely of beans on very soft white retro bun from food basics I would guess. Shareable and good fries. Forgettable drinks with nice beer list. Ginger cider smelled great but no depth. Service was nice and the place is fun. But look at the specials. Seemed to be where the interesting foods are."}
{"text":"When you walk in the place smells a little funny, and looks dark and dingy. But, if you sit down and stay for a meal you might be pleasantly surprised.

I came here for brunch on a weekday, the prices were very reasonable and the service was quick. I had eggs with toast, potato, and pemeal bacon. It was super tasty!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Skyline since the takeover and re-opening, so I'm glad I finally made it back to this Parkdale classic. I'm happy this place is still a thing, but overall the food wasn't as impressive as I'd hoped for.

But first, the good parts:
I liked that they kept the interior much the same as the original, including the awesome red booth seating.
I also like that they have good beer on tap (Collective Arts' Ransack the Universe IPA ftw!), and decent wine selections, both at reasonable prices.
And one thing cool about the menu is that they kept a bunch of classic diner type food that seems similar to the original menu, but offer a variety of daily specials as well. 
And to their credit, the service was friendly and pretty quick in getting everything out to us.

That said, prices are reasonable but the food was just okay for those prices. The burger specifically was super greasy, to the point where a grease puddle was left on my plate, and the apps we had were filling but also limited in wow factor.
So in the end, my review remains the 3 stars that the original got."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place so many times on my various Parkdale adventures, I knew a time would finally come to partake in a greasy spoon breakfast. This weekend, that time came. 
The restaurant is surprisingly large once you walk in and get past the counter area. The environment is legitimately the \"vintage diner vibe\" from the red leather booths, the original oldschool lighting, and cash only payment option.

One cool thing I did like about their menu is the Egg Nog Milkshake. They actually make a house made egg nog which means you're not restricted to egg nog deliciousness exclusively during the winter holiday season. Admittedly its a bit more like a vanilla and egg nog combination in the flavour, but I still enjoyed it. 

Food menu is pretty large but I usually like to try a standard egg/meat/potato/toast breakfast the first time at a diner. For $9.75 you get 3 eggs, 3 pieces of meat, home fries, and toast. It's not the greatest deal but the meal is hearty and adequate. I liked the home fries as they were not overly greasy or overcooked, but still had a nice flavour and slight seasoning to them. 
My dining companion had an cheese and bacon sandwich on toast which I believe was about $6.50 (+$3 option to add french fries or salad). Neither of us seemed disappointed or overly enthused about our food, so definitely in the 3 star placement. 

Service was not great in the attention department or taking orders, but the food came out quickly. So in the end, its as perfectly fine of a breakfast dining experience as you should expect in little divey places like this."}
{"text":"Quaint would be a good word to describe it. 

The owners are very friendly, the interior is very unique, and most of the patrons seem to be regulars. 

While I didn't particularly enjoy my choice of food, I'm chalking it up to my desire to experiment with vegetarian food I've no experience with - definitely prepared to give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Decent food for a decent price. Had the souvlaki meal and fish and chips. Found the fish and chips below average but was happy with the souvlaki meal.

Really old school dinner. Cool look to it inside."}
{"text":"Recently taken over from Louie I was worried the new owners would mess this greasy spoon gem up,they didn't.This was my go to Steak and Eggs place whenever I'm in Parkdale and it didn't disappoint.
 When they reopened after a month long reno.Still a great classic diner with reasonable prices.Steak and Eggs is still $14 and the owners run the 3 Speed,the Wallflower and the Ace on Roncie,so if you like thise places you know what to expect from staff and atmosphere.Bonus points for not actually being a hipster joint despite the number of tattoos."}
{"text":"Had a delicious tuna melt and wanted to say thank you, thank you very much. This place is a delight and feels like home. The coolest band in the world plays in the back on Monday nights."}
{"text":"Very nice service doesn't make up for bad food at a ridiculous price. They advertise a $7 breakfast special well after they don't offer it anymore. I think they should stop advertising it if they don't have it. The sign was still up as we left almost an hour later. No matter, we decided to give it a whirl anyway. Our omelets were pretty good - five minutes before they were taken off the grill. They arrived overcooked and rubbery and the boiled potatoes they came with were mealy and tasteless. It was honestly not a great plate for $6, let alone $13. We really regretted not going up Roncey a bit to one of the many spots where they have better food at half the price.
This place could be very good - the waitress was very nice, the location is killer, and the place has a neat lounge vibe. It reminded me of an extremely cool tiki lounge I used to frequent in Milwaukee. Maybe if they dimmed the lights a little, played up the rat pack decor a little, and fixed the food it'd be great. But for a restaurant, especially a brunch spot, food quality and value for the price range are just too important to me to say Skylight was average."}
{"text":"Well...went in for first time since ownership changed.  Walked out 10 minutes later.  Staring at a table of dirty dishes for 10 feet away for 10 minutes made me lose my desire to give them money.  The menu...nothing special and overpriced.  Kale ceasar salad?  Just no.  The drinks...you're giving me diner/divey  vibe and charging me King West pricing.  Oh no...wait...King West has drink specials.  And can we not with this \"we have fried chicken every second week\" nonsense?  Brought the table of dishes to server's attention as to why we just wanted our bill for a round of cokes...he apologized and did nothing about it.  Paid $7.50 for three CANS of coke and left.  Went to a pub for some real \"diner grub\" and paid LESS than they were charging.  C'mon Skyline...if you just wanted the space...cool...but change the name."}
{"text":"I must have walked by this place a few hundred times, always intrigued by the retro sign, but never venturing indoors. Maybe the cheap breakfast sign threw me off, maybe I just couldn't see past the dusty window. 

One recent morning, with all my cooking implements and ingredients packed away from a recent move, hunger took hold and I decided to take a gamble. I cautiously opened the door...

And it's lovely. 

A well kept and clean interior, very attentive, quick and friendly staff. A sort of cool and understated 60's feel to the place. I feel that whiskey would have been served alongside eggs here in the Mad Men version of history. 

It's not an overly ambitious or creative menu, mostly American breakfast classics, but $6.75 (w/taxes) for the breakfast special (a few eggs, four slices of bacon, toast and taters) is pretty awesome value."}
{"text":"On route to pick up a take out order in the area, we just stumbled on this place and am glad we went in. It's refreshing to have genuine service and the solid playlist throughout really added to the setting. A diner setting, but with a hint of Marley in the air.

Met 3 staff - 2 front of the house, 1 back - all exceptionally friendly and accommodating. Food was good, drinks were nice.

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, a lot of healthy options. My film's cast & crew stopped in late one Monday evening after a long travel day and this restaurant was beyond what we could've asked for. The food was great. The service was timely. And there was even a local band who started playing just before we left. Great experience!"}
{"text":"I remember checking out Skyline several years ago and being far from impressed by the food, so I wasn't exactly champing at the bit for another visit. But when I was informed that the menu had been completely overhauled by new owners, I figured I should give it another shot.

I'm so glad I did.

We arrived at lunchtime on a Saturday and the place was pretty much packed. We wound up with the last table and quickly perused the slim menu. After clarifying the difference between the Clubhouse and the Skyline Special Clubhouse, I opted for the latter (which comes with turkey salad, bacon, tomatoes, and lettuce).

It took a while for the food to come but it was absolutely worth the wait. This is one tasty sandwich (and it's friggin' enormous, too!) The turkey salad seems weird at first, but as you keep eating, it becomes tastier and tastier, and it also proves an ideal complement to the bacon, tomatoes, and lettuce. (All of which were perfect.) The accompanying fries were also delicious.

I guess my only complaint would be that the service was inattentive, to put it mildly, as I think we saw our waitress twice: once to order and then to pay. But the joint *was* slammed, so I'm willing to let that go...especially in light of that phenomenal sammich."}
{"text":"I just love how Skyline has a totally different menu everyday! We were in town for the weekend and decided to dinner. The food was exceptional and tasted like real homemade. Service was also wonderful. Very attentive staff, and a manager willing to give our positive feedback directly and immediately to kitchen staff. We will be back on our next visit to Toronto!

PS.
Try the molasses cake for dessert. It's the servers mothers recipe and it tastes like Christmas!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for anyone who wants  that classic diner feel but get healthy options. I ordered the classic breakfast and asked for salad and the cook not only gave the substitute but it was a wonderful salad."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have passed this place countless times and decided to finally give it a go. Two salads nearing $40 (with tip) seems to be a hefty price. 

The Greek salad was not up to par with the Greek salads we are used to. Unfortunately it didn't appeal to my bf. The dressing was off, the feta cheese was stale, and the chicken wasn't seasoned as a souvlaki chicken skewers often are. 

I ordered the Niçoise salad. It had almost everything a Niçoise salad is meant to have, soft boiled eggs, potato, avocado, mixed greens, onions. My problems were with their \"Italian tuna\", their roasted tomatoes and the fact they didnt have any green beans, like most Niçoise salads have. Their tuna had a weird aftertaste.... I dont even know how to describe it.. it felt off on my palette, like a umamae or something. Their tomatoes were roasted and split. I mistook that for them being bad. They weren't bad. However, their menu did not state the tomatoes were roasted in the salad. I probably would've asked for them plain, as they taste fresher to me.

Overall it was a disappointment because both salads looked so good coming out of the kitchen and we wanted them to taste as good as they looked. 

Next time, we're trying something else. The appeal to return comes from their frequently busy status and their ambiance, which is if you're going in the late afternoon, you pretty much have the choice to sit where you'd like in their diner-esque restaurant. 

They have a hipster, retro feel to their space, with cool bird paintings on their back dining room walls. And picnic blanket style table clothes, making for a homey energy- welcoming and inviting."}
{"text":"Gord and I stopped at the Skyline Restaurant in Parkdale for breakfast.  

I ordered the No. 2 and Gord ordered the No. 3.  

It's not a fancy place but the food was good and at a good price.  If you are in Parkdale, you should check it out."}
{"text":"A pleasant retro/indie aesthetic; including red booth seating and fairy lights really gave this restaurant a great vibe. I also appreciated the interesting daily specials. Food was good not great but at their price point I'll take it. Ordered the breakfast poutine and grape fruit juice, total came to $15.30 (not including tip)"}
{"text":"Something charming about eating in a diner after dark. The food wasn't SPECTACULAR, but the burger was juicy, the fries were crispy and their guac was pretty good. Pies behind the glass were tempting and there's plenty to drink. Good vibes, cool ambiance, would definitely come back. There was a live band setting up as I was taking care of the bill, might have to pop in again."}
{"text":"Been here twice and I really liked the service. Breakfast was good and their house made lemonade is delicious but a bit pricy imo. Had dinner and it was okay, my boyfriend really enjoyed the burger but I found my grilled cheese was burnt (but how??). But the saving grace was the chocolate hazelnut pie... amazing. I'll probably come back regardless but mainly for brunch/breakfast."}
{"text":"You know what I like? Diners.

You know what I don't like? Hangovers.

Put the two together and it makes the day after drinking go much more smoothly. Such is the case for Skyline, aka my lifeline over the holiday weekend. 

Sprite and an egg sandwich is just what my throbbing head needed. Not too light, not too greasy, add a little salt or hot sauce for those toasted taste buds. Juuuuust right!

Once able to look up and enjoy my surroundings, I was quite pleased with Skyline's vibe. Retro chic, clean, and very cool staff working the brunch shift. I especially enjoy the \"picture window\" where the kitchen can see out into the dining room - but you have to look kinda close since said window is part of a paint by numbers collage on the wall. Sneaky...

Whether or not I had too much to drink the night before or just wanted a tuna melt, I'd totally go back to Skyline."}
{"text":"One of my faves. Atmosphere is great and they have classic diner comfort food with some fun twists thrown in."}
{"text":"The only vegetarian option for lunch that i could see was grilled cheese. I got that with fries and a pickle. It was okay. Service was great, so I'll give it three stars. 

I think Pete's Grill has much better for food."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me this long to finally visit this Parkdale institution. I've been a west-end resident for over six years and last week was my first time through the doors. For shame. 

I know its been taken over by new owners recently and I love that they opted to not \"pave paradise\" and instead maintain the classic diner's charm, with some improvements of course. 

From what I understand the menu has been significantly upgraded, but I opted for a pretty classic combo on my lunch time visit: cream of tomato soup and grilled cheese. To be honest, the soup was more cream and less tangy tomato than I prefer, but it hit the spot nonetheless. I also sampled some of my lunch companion's massive onion rings and mental noted to order them for myself next time."}
{"text":"When the old Skyline diner closed I was sad. Where was I going to get my eggs and hot sandwich weirdness on the weekends? 

Then the new ownership took over, my little family popped in on a Friday night and I realized: Who cares?! Skyline Restaurant is my new 'hood favourite. Smell ya later diner breakfasts, hello lovely pastas, burgers, cocktails and, well, still breakfasts... but better breakfasts! Don't get me wrong, I love diners, but this place is just the tops, so I can find another greasy spoon.

They kept the good bits of the old joint: the iconic sign, the general layout, only the counter is now a bar and the back is no longer banquet hall strangeness, but lovely wooden tables and booths. The food is homemade perfection and the staff is a god damn delight. 

Rejoice, Parkdale!"}
{"text":"The big ol' diner sign outside of the Skyline on Queen West West has always called my name, but I'd assumed it was overrun with hungover cool kids on weekend days, so I had avoided it. Well, I now live closer to this beaut and I wanted to brave it. This past Sunday at 11am I wandered in. Here is my story.* 

Much to my surprise, it was a few middle aged couples, a lovely waitress in the front and an awesome old dude cooking diner classics in the back. Typical diner counter with soft booths near the windows and a surprisingly large banquet-style room with red table cloths at the rear. 

I love a good twist. 

I had the club sandwich and a strawberry milkshake, and I watched some lovely men slay some eggs and a hot chicken sandwich. We all really enjoyed our meals. At the end we were pretty surprised it was cash only, but learn from our mistakes, and pack some paper. 

*Said in my most Law and Order-y voice."}
