{"text":"Have not been here for years, new owner/operator. Generally speaking, foods are average +, a few veggies/tofu dishes are quite good, place is a bit older but clean, service is good, prices are reasonable, they have dinner buffet too. if you in around this neighborhood then you can drop in to try."}
{"text":"Tried it again to see if my first experience was just a bad one. I don't like to write bad reviews but this place is just awful. The guy who runs the place points to the  corner and tells you to take a seat. That's the last I even made eye contact with any staff for the rest of the meal. Food was not great with very little flavor. Typical low end buffet with a good selection of deep fried everything that all tastes the same. If you like Jello, you'll like dessert! I gave them two stars because I actually liked the deep fried chicken wings."}
{"text":"We found this place through yelp, it was clean and we did the buffet.  The buffet was small but good value for the price."}
