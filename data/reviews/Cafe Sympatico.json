{"text":"Penne vegetariana was delicious. Will try other dishes next time. Establishment is clean and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Randomly chose this place after stocking up at the LCBO in the same plaza yesterday (what strike??!!).  I ordered the Alla Mama (grilled chicken breast, roasted red peppers, lettuce and pesto mayo spread on a ciabatta bun) and was not disappointed.  Nice and tasty sandwich.  The atmosphere was quite nice, not too brightly lit, cozy ambiance.  It was like walking into a small bistro, replete with blackboards with the menu written in chalk.  Pleasantly surprised at this place...and isn't that what alot of us here enjoy - finding a nice place to east when you least expected it? :)  They have many more sandwiches here, freshly-made soups, the requisite coffee selection, all-day breakfast, wraps and some serious-looking desserts.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"This cafe is the BEST cafe in town. I visit every week while I do my laundry at the coin laundry nearby. The owner Steve is especially very polite and courteous. Their cappuccino tastes extremely fresh (unlike some burnt coffee at other places)and they have a daily fresh selection of pastry and snacks. The main course has a large selection and is very reasonably priced and extremely delicious. They take extra care on allergy alerts when notified. They told me they will be opening late hours soon which is good news. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, quality has gone very low ordered a veal sandwich . The veal was very tough needed a pair of pliers as teeth to eat it . Ive had the sauce before you can buy it at no frills its called ragu . Got cheese mushrooms and zucchini on my sandwhich it came to 15.45 cents highly overpriced garbage sandwich. The only thing i liked was the decore and service . Good place to come for a coffee but that's about all. Cafe sympati-no for the food ."}
{"text":"Coffee service was fast and friendly.  Looks like a good spot for regulars, the strip mall is pretty ugly otherwise."}
{"text":"Amazing spot. Very cozy and relaxing. The food was excellent. I ordered penne vegetariana and chocolate banana crepes. The pasta was delicious. The crepes were THE BEST I ever had. You must try them, you won't be disappointed.   The service was also very friendly. Overall 5 Stars. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here two or three times with my mom. It's a nice cafe, one of the nicer ones in the area. By that, I mean the atmosphere is interesting and the coffee is good (I usually get a black americano). The food was pretty tasty, too, which is always a bonus. I like that they have a patio outside in the summer, and have a friendly staff. It's probably the best cafe in the plaza. It's kind of small, but if you can get a seat pretty worthwhile."}
{"text":"Great little place for lunch or breakfast. The staff is attentive and friendly. Food and coffee was delicious."}
{"text":"Quality Ingredients in simple home made sandwich's an pasta. Ill admit the place looks a little obscure and hasnt found a true identity. But the fact remains that they serve tasty hand crafted sandwhichs, an they use fresh ingrediants in there pasta. This is a recommended TAKE OUT joint."}
{"text":"This is a very unique place that I like but have a few qualms with, first of all the prices in this place are fairly steep especially considering what your getting.  They serve all day breakfast but it is about $10 I believe (even during breakfast hrs) when most places are offering the same thing for much less. That is with most of the dishes here, but I will say they offer a large selection of pastas and sandwiches here with fairly large portions. Much of the selection of pasta includes seafood I am not personally a fan of this but I know some people who are and may find this very appealing.  They do offer daily specials which always change and some delicious home made soups that are affordable and change with the specials.  Some other minor things that didn't sit that well with me were the fact that they do not have ranch dressing... at all. I like my garden salad with ranch sometimes and they only serve it with thier house vinigerette dressing. Also, I am not the biggest fan of their coffee and barista drinks which is a shame becuase I have tried so very hard to like them. The seating isn't the greatest either, this is a really small venue with limited space and seating so you are literally sitting right next to strangers or waiting a while for a seat in the busier periods.  But all that being said, above anything else I really enjoy the service here; especially if you get the pleasure of being served by the lady you see on their signs, she is so warm and kind always geeting you with that trademark smile!"}
{"text":"Nice little sandwich shop with a good variety of hot and cold offerings. Usually busy, but not packed and the service is reasonably fast, ESP for cooked to order meals.  The parking in this plaza is much improved, making it a better place to just drop by and grab a bite. You won't go too far wrong here."}
{"text":"Nice place with friendly staff. Food is good with large portions. It is expensive. I do recommend trying it."}
{"text":"I use to love this place.. This was a hidden gem....however change of management, food quality gone down by alot... Lost its freshness.. Pies are old and cold.. Pasta are microwaved... Sad to see this place go down.. Recommendation bring the old chef back.."}
{"text":"Nice cozy spot, with super friendly employees. You can never go wrong with their coffee. Baristas really know what they're doing."}
{"text":"I love supporting small independent restaurants, and as I stopped at a nearby bank on my lunch and needed to grab a bite I thought I would try this promising cosy little caf√© on a whim.  Generally I run away from neon signs and I was originally going to do take out, once inside I decided to sit and enjoy an Italian panini sandwich. I chose the Alla Mama, featuring grilled chicken breast, lettuce, roasted red peppers, and an enticing pesto mayo.  For just 10 bucks it comes with soup or choice of salad, and I thought a Ceasar would be a good accompaniment, sticking with the Italian theme.  I sat down and waited for my order to arrive, and was not disappointed with the sandwich. However, the train left the rails with the salad.  Now I realize the main feature here is the sandwich, and it was good. But the salad ought to have been more than an afterthought. The grocery store dressing was thoughtlessly gooped on top, and the only discernable hint of parmesan was an off white dust found here and there - it could easily have been mistaken for drywall. I'm hoping the croutons were at least made in house but judging by the store bought sauce (I have the same brand at home) and the Kraft processed parm out of a shaker, I'm not holding out much hope.  This is positively the worst Caesar salad I've ever had ... and I've eaten army Caesar salads made in bulk feeding troops in a dining hall.   It's a shame really, it doesn't take much effort to buy quality shaved or shredded parm cheese, which doubles as great pasta topping too. Croutons are easy to toast and as a sandwich shop they would have plenty of leftover bread. With a little effort and some anchovy paste you can make a great Caesar dressing. They put thought care into their sandwiches, and apparently their homemade soups if I believe the other reviews.  But this salad is an insult to Caesar. It's the reason this is now a 4 or 5 review.   Finishing off, the charm and cosy setting and sidewalk seating is a bonus, plus a huge selection of sandwiches and lineup of coffee that would make Starbucks blush, are great reasons to come and stay to eat. Just skip the Caesar."}
{"text":"Came here for a business lunch and was NOT impressed. The staff was very friendly which was nice. I ordered the veal parmigiana and the veal came to me cold and had an overwhelming taste of freezer burn. I figured the pasta would be better but I was mistaken, tasted sour. I would recommend coming here for a coffee or date, the atmosphere is nice, but god is the food terrible."}
