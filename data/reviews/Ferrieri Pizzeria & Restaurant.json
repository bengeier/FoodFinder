{"text":"Family owned. A good place for an excellent meatball sub. The pizza is really good too. A nice little secret in Houston!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good, calzone was great -- place was clean and the owners were very nice. All in all we'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Ferrieri's is by far the best pizza, sub and Calzone/Stromboli place in Washington County.  It's owned and operated by real Italians from the old country -- Mr. Ferrieri brought the Calzone with him from Italy and introduced it to the U.S.  Their sauce and dough are authentic and made on premises.  Fresh ingredients, large pizzas, portions and sub's.  Nice family as well.

Can't believe someone would rate Vocelli's or any other chain above Ferrieri's.  But then half the time this entire Pittsburgh Metro area doesn't know good food when it's right on top of them -- too many chain op's.  A year or two ago Pittsburgh area voted Pizza Hut number one pizza.......there ya are, go figure.  Anyone who would say that ANY chain pizza was good, is out of their minds and has no taste what so ever.
You always get what you pay for.  Give Ferrieri's a try."}
{"text":"This pizza is good, but the calzones/strombolis are to die for particulary the steak and cheese, expensive but worth it. enjoy."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to anyone. Best pizza around and the prices are good too. Pizza, cheesy garlic bread, jalape√±o poppers and mozzarella sticks are a go to.
I couldn't say enough good things about the owners and staff there. You can tell it's family owned which is great and everyone there is always very friendly."}
{"text":"Great ma and pop pizza shop in houston, canonsburg area, huge slices, huge pizza, huge flavor, decently priced well worth the quality you dont get with the greasy chains"}
{"text":"Functional pizza that didn't elevate itself from others in the area.  The dough was dry on this visit (possibly an unproofed batch of dough) an might not have been the best representation of their product. (However I have to go off of what I served)."}
{"text":"Great New York style pizza and Giant Subs.  Great Family that has been making pizza for years"}
{"text":"Very low key, but THE best kept secret in Canonsburg / Houston PA area. One of the best New York style thin cut pies that I ever had. This is a family owned restaurant that is always treats me well. Probably had about 100 pizzas for take out here. They are very consistent. Not the best place for dine in but do see people from time to time eating in. They are well known for their calzone / strombolis as well."}
{"text":"I don't honestly know what was worse...the attitude of the old guy making the pizza or the nasty pizza itself. I stopped on my way back to my hotel and thought I'd give a local business a try.  No hello, just attitude and a grunt at what I wanted.  I'm sorry if you had to make my food...I thought that's kind of what you do there. It's no wonder the place was empty. 

I got back to my hotel and opened the box. What I had was a pizza with little sauce and almost no flavor. I've had better frozen crap. Skip this joint and save some money."}
{"text":"YUM.  Great pizza. Owner's and workers are very nice.

Every time I take their pizza anywhere people rave about it.  You will not go hungry, these pizzas are enormous too.

It's right off the interstate, so it's convenient to get to and back on your way.

Some of the best pizza around."}
{"text":"Expensive for the quality provided.  Service and friendliness leave something to be desired too.  Even the local chains Vocelli and Papa John's are better.  The best local pizza in this area is Pizzaz on Rt 19."}
{"text":"Pizza and breadsticks were tasty. $22 and change for a 15 inch 2 topping pizza, 6 breadsticks, and 2 drinks. It took about 15-20 minutes after ordering and they were not busy, so I would expect to wait awhile if it is a busier time of day."}
