{"text":"Beautiful decor, Great service and the food, lets just say it was the best pizza I've had and the burgers are top notch.   It's a hidden gem you have to try."}
{"text":"Tucked in the back of Williamsburg Square on the south side of Detroit, AJ's greets you with a warm and sleek decor--rich deep earthy tones, dark wood, concrete floors stain-swirled in chocolate brown. Service is friendly, and spot-on: despite a nice-sized lunch crowd, we've been seated and served quickly, and orders were delivered with all requested substitutions. The food is well-prepared and nicely presented--soups hot and tasty; salads crisp and colorful; sandwiches, wraps, entrees just what they should be. Pleasant atmosphere, consistent menu quality."}
{"text":"Appetizer of fries, $9. Six inch sub with dry meat, $11. All sides cost $3 to go along with your entree. Decent food with small portions, weird atmosphere, and one of the most overpriced experiences I have had in a long time. Definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Have been going here for years. Love then Italian sub, waffle fries, but my favorite is the breakfast border (no mayo)!! One of my favorite places to get lunch in Cleveland.  IMG_0341.JPG"}
{"text":"In town visiting friends who wanted to take us out for a quick bite & drinks. The bartender was great (as were the urban Cosmo and the sapphire & tonic). I have severe food allergies, and our waitress Jodi went above and beyond to check the ingredients of every single menu item that interested me. She ended up having the kitchen alter an existing recipe just to guarantee my safe eating, and checked on me multiple times...but it doesn't end there. The food was phenomenal! This place is a true hidden gem. The table had wings and their gourmet cheese fries, and then we all had some sort of wrap or sandwich. Everything was wonderful, and Jodi was fantastic. Thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"After a long day on he road, my family stopped here for dinner. The food was great, the server was friendly, and the environment was enjoyable. I would come here again if I lived nearby!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  Went with a group of 8 people.  Placed order and waited 15 minutes when everyone's food but mine came out. Waitress told me the new cook burned my lunch and they had to re cook. I saw many other orders for other tables come out but when everyone at my table was finished with their meal, I still did not have my food.  Not a Manager in sight, never came to our table to discuss this.  Horrible service."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome.  I have only been able to go for lunch but their hamburgers are amazing.  Serious kudos to the chef on them.  They also source their bread from a local bakery.  Make sure to check it out and don't forget the waffle fries!"}
{"text":"I'm pleasantly suprised with this place, I wouldn't expect such great food and services from a place in a strip mall. I had the kahuna burger, it was perfectly grilled and on what tastes like a home made tosted bun. The waitress was efficient and nice. Great environment.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My neighbor and I went to Urban Grill for lunch on Monday afternoon and it was our first time at the restaurant. We were impressed with the friendliness of the staff on entering and had a wonderful waiter, Chris. The food was excellent she had the shrimp tacos and Caprice salad I had the perch sandwich with side house salad with house dressing. It was served in good time and everything was so fresh, salads are wonderful not that ice berg some places give you. My sandwich was tasty well done and her taco shrimp tacos were wonderful the Caprice salad was yummy. I would certainly go back again. There is a nice little outdoor patio very cute shame it faces parking lot but very nice."}
{"text":"Having been a regular at Stonehouse Grill for years (and quite happy with my experiences) I was excited to try another restaurant from the same owner.    My first trip to Urban Grill was for carry-out.  They have a special counter just for carryout, which is nice for a busy night, so you don't have to wait at the bar to get your order.  That is where my great experience stopped.  I  had ordered the chicken grinder sans banana peppers.  When I unwrapped my sandwich, I had been given a chicken sub with banana peppers.  I recognized it as their chicken sub, because I have ordered it at Stonehouse.  When I looked at the menu thinking that I might have ordered the wrong  meal, I noticed that they don't even offer a chicken sub on the menu at Urban Grill.  I was disappointed, but could live with it.  My second trip was for a sit-down dinner with friends. We went on a Saturday night and just had to wait 10 minutes for a seat.  Our service was great.  I ordered the prime rib grinder and it was very yummy.  There was a steak special, which my friend ordered and he thought it was good, but not good enough for $28.  Hubby got the Thai chicken salad - it was huge and he liked it.  Other friend ordered the chicken risotto, which she said was excellent.  My third trip was for Sunday brunch, and that trip is what will make it my last.  My husband and I walked in and there was no one around - no guest waiting and no one to greet us. When we were finally greeted, we were told that it would be a half an hour wait - there seemed to be a lot of large parties already sitting and eating, so whatever...  Okay, we'll try to get a seat at the bar.  Now the bar area is very small - about 4 high tops and maybe 10 people could sit at the bar uncomfortably.  We were told that the bar seats were first come, first serve. Okay, we'll try sitting at one of the open high tops.  Sat there for about 10 minutes while watching the bar tender do everything and anything but tend bar. Seats opened up at the bar.  Okay, maybe she'll see us if we move to the bar.  Sat another 10 minutes just watching the bartender count her tips, clean up plates, go to the back and disappear (it's not like she came back with food in her hand).  Then I looked down the bar and noticed that almost every glass was empty.  That bartender knew we were there. I even made eye contact and did the eye-brow raise thing to indicate that we were interested in talking to her. Nothing. She deliberately ignored us.  *@$# her.  We waited exactly 25 minutes.  Should have just put our names on the wait list.  We just got up and left.  No one noticed or said a thing. Shameful.  Never, NEVER again will I patronize Urban Grill and most likely Stonehouse too (will be hard since I usually get food there once a week, but that is how disgusted I am)."}
{"text":"We found the place on the second try and pulled into the shopping center, to look it up again.  It was a little dark but nice and cozy place. I ordered the patty melt with onion rings and my wife the seafood mac and cheese.  While asking for Tobacco I got a sauce cup full.  I got to admit I was a little surprised as with 35 years of asking for Tabasco in restaurants this was the first time I got a sauce cup full. My wif's mac and cheese had a lot of lobster and shrimp.  After my wife was full I got to snag some for myself.    As ith every restaurant on this trip it took longer than expected to get our food."}
{"text":"Food is AWESOME. It's never busy and they have an excellent menu. Best pizza in town in my opinion but there are plenty of other options if that's not what you're in the mood for.  The service is usually great as well but they do have one waitress who's a little less than friendly. Make sure to request any server besides Jody and you'll have a great time. She's the only reason I didn't give five stars!"}
{"text":"Very average food, and service was below average both times that I have visited.  Service today was very slow, and also rude.  Sandwich prices are higher than average for not including fries (unless you pay $1.50 extra).  Most restaurants in the area include fries for around the same price.  If food quality was extremely high, I might feel it was more of a value for the price, but like I said, it's all just very average (at best).  You may not get food poisoning from eating here, but you won't really have an overly positive, or memorable dining experience either.  I won't be going back here, because there are much better dining options just down the street in either direction."}
{"text":"First of all, if you can get past the strip mall facade it's totally worth it. We have been there on multiple occasions and I'm a fan of any of the cajun dishes and the chicken quesadillas, very filling.  Very generous portions and the wait staff was friendly, but not overbearing. We will continue to return here for great food and family atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have to say this is one of my favorite places to eat! The steaks are very good and everything tastes great too!"}
{"text":"Best. Dry. Rubbed. Wings. Happy hour brews are the best deal around. They serve Head Hunter, and on Tuesdays, it's $2 Pint days! The Beef on Weck Special is a wonderful pair to your Pint! The bar and restaurant servers are the best in the area----friendly, expeditious and attentive. You really can't go wrong with any food item on the menu. Lobster Mac n Cheese is a gourmet treat at a bargain. So glad to have recommended AJs to many, and am finally reaching out to you, my Yelp community!"}
{"text":"First time here, came in on pizza night. Got buffalo chicken pizza (needed extra hot sauce) and kahuna burger with onion rings. Both items were good. Excited to give a second try."}
{"text":"Their food is really good, but when having to buy a-la-carte it gets expensive quick! as to mention their drinks are as well! Otherwise I have not had a problem the few times i've been here."}
{"text":"What a great find - you wouldn't expect to find this kind of place tucked in a strip mall in Westlake, OH.  But the food, service and ambiance were all 5 star. We were in with a group of 14 people and were treated to an amazing evening. Starting with the food: expertly prepared, served hot, and nice portions. We had the chicken risotto and blackened salmon. I'm generally a salmon snob, and this fish did not disappoint.  Others at the table had the filet, short ribs and pizza.  All I heard was \"yum!\"  The service: our waitress Kim was wonderful.  She handled our (somewhat demanding) table with great aplomb.  Always with a smile and quick response. Now, the ambiance: this place is special.   If you're looking for casual, chic and comfortable...this is it. We had our group in The Crate Room. The walls are decorated in old wine crates.  So cool!   And, oh yeah, the wine menu compares favorably with the best in the Cleveland area. Lastly, I've not been to many places where the owners make you feel more welcomed than at AJ's Urban Grill. If you run into Audrey, Jeff, Damon, Cindy or Scott...you'll be treated like family. Well, maybe better than family!   ;)    Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"No problem with the food (very good) or the service!  The surprise came when the check arrived....$3.75 for a Budweiser?  Seriously?  That's just OVERPRICED.    We will return to enjoy the food, but will stick with soda and go elsewhere for a drink."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is really nice inside. Yeah-- it's in a strip mall, but so what. If I had to use one word to describe the ambiance, I would say rustic. Nice floors (appeared to be stained concrete), lots of earth tones, plenty of wood, everything is brand new.   I haven't dined in yet, but I couldn't help to notice their full service bar. Looks like it was pretty well stocked too. I wouldn't mind stopping in for a quick lunch and cocktail (nobody has to know).   While I was waiting for my takeout to come out from the kitchen, I was asked by several different servers 'have you been helped yet.' They were all very friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be at work today (always important).  For lunch I went with the southwest salad ($8), add salmon ($5). Mixed greens, corn, black beans, garbanzo beans, tomato's, cheese and tortilla strips. I just loved the meatiness of the salad, (even though my fish came on the side, as requested) they def didn't skimp on the ingredients. The thing that made this exceptional was the house made, southwest ranch dressing. I'd recommend asking for extra dressing, I'd rather be safe than sorry.  My salmon was blackened (upon request) and this was one huge piece of salmon. Put it this way, the portion appeared to be the same thing they serve at dinner as an entree. It was good, but now I'm curious to add steak or chicken next time (I'm too picky about my shrimp).  My coworker went with the margherita pizza, she said it was really good, thin crust, nice ingredients, not too filling. It looked great. I was too preoccupied with my salmon salad to try any.  All in all, this is good, quality food. I believe they are using fresh ingredients and making things in house, which is what it's all about."}
{"text":"I was surprised at how beautiful the inside of this restaurant is. It's packed in a strip mall and such a hidden gem. Aside from the lovely atmosphere, the food is delicious! Try the spinach dip- it was the best app I've had in a while."}
{"text":"We always have a great meal here. Everything seems to be made fresh and the staff is very friendly and helpful. We especially like Mary. She is awesome!!! The decor is nice and clean. Keep up the good work and keep it fresh!!!"}
{"text":"Their new location near Detroit and Columbia is really nice, and every time that I have been, I have been more and more impressed by their food.  Their sandwiches and burgers are amazing, and their pizza is good.  On Saturday nights they have half off bottles of wine.  Very impressed with this place and it's a great change of pace from all the boring chain restaurants in Westlake."}
{"text":"We always look forward to going to AJ's Urban Grille. Happy hour prices and selection are great! We love the loaded waffle fries. The specials each night are very good...The pizza, the calzones, and the soft tacos. I usually don't care for soft tacos, but they toast the shell, so it provides a nice crunch. There was a good combination of cheese, protein, and salsas. The veggie calzone was nice and cheesy with ricotta cheese making it richer.  The atmosphere and the service on the bar side are great.  The drinks are a bit over priced, but we come for the consistently good meals."}
{"text":"I have been to AJ's Urban Grille twice since it relocated to its new home on Detroit Rd in Westlake, OH.   All I can say is that the food, atmosphere, and staff are excellent. I can also tell you I don't hand out that type of feedback and glowing review very often. See my other reviews and you'll certainly see that.   1. The staff are so friendly. Seriously, they are very accomodating, greet you, refill your drinks w/o having to pester them.  2. The food is great and fresh. The salads are remarkable. I've had both the Greek Salad and the Buffalo salad. They are huge! The veggies are fresh. Seriously, super fresh - it's not like other places where you can tell the salad has been in the fridge from yesterday or the morning. They are made with fresh, crispy peppers, onions, tomatoes, etc.  3. The atmosphere is bright, quaint and clean. They keep it simple and clean.   Well done. Will certainly be back to try yet another salad!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour. Great service and strong drinks from Tony. Better than average bar apps and at a good price at $5 each. Will go back."}
{"text":"My GF and moved to Westlake about two weeks ago and we have been to AJ's twice now. Both of our visits we had Jan as our bartender/server. She is a true asset to the restaurant, not to say that the food and drinks are not phenomenal cause they are but she is very passionate about the spot and sells it as if it was her own!   The weekly specials are great, Mexican night on Thursday and wine specials on Saturday. The spicy margaritas are great. Other items we enjoyed were the spin dip and lettuce wraps. We will definitely be back on the first nice day to enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"There was about 8 of us in this party that we went to celebrate 2 birthdays during the St Patrick's Day week. The food was decent but nothing to write home about. Everyone ordered a very good variety of food. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan which was fair again nothing to write home about with the fettuccine noodles that were just buttered noodles nothing with sauce on them at all. I was going to send them back but I was so hungry I really didn't want to wait another half an hour for my food. Service wasn't all that great either. We had to keep asking for things & then she took her good old time returning with the things we wanted. This wasn't my choice of restaurant it was someone else's doing in picking this restaurant out. I will not return to this restaurant if we do it won't be during the Holidays that is for darn sure, but maybe check out their other restaurant that they own instead of this one. Don't waste your money on this restaurant you might not like it or the service either."}
{"text":"First off, I am a fan of StoneHouse grill their sister restaurant on Center Ridge.  Also, I was a huge fan of the Original A&J's and went their at least a few times a month.  I was very to happy to see that they were relocating in the same vicinity.  However, I glanced at the menu and its much pricier than the original A&J's.  Also, I was very disappointed to see that they did not have their signature Hot Fries or Cheeseburger Sub on the menu.  If you ate at the prior A&J's you know what I am talking about, I always ordered the Hot fries and they will be missed.  I ordered the Italian Sub to go and it was mediocre at best.    I'm also confused on why they call it an Urban Grill, when it's in the middle of Suburbia?  Also, they did do a very nice job on the interior and bar and that might be why the prices seem high.  I may go back, but this is no longer the same A&J's that I used to know.  I really miss the Hot Fries......."}
{"text":"I think Aj's is a great neighborhood restaurant. Its not fancy,  not creative,  BUT, consistently good. It's the kind of place you run into your friend or neighbor or maybe sit at the bar and watch a tribe game It has a nice rustic atmosphere. The tomato bisque is a winner!"}
{"text":"This local place has good beer prices for Happy hour but is also good for family with kids.  There is a 5/7/9 menu that you should use if there between 4-6.  Staff is friendly, service is very goddess.  It's a place you need to try."}
{"text":"Food here is really good, and service is great. All the lunches are amazing!."}
{"text":"Pretty diverse menu  Service is questionable  Coca-Cola without Bubbles  Not a great value  Decent Location  Not in a hurry to return"}
{"text":"AJs is a great locally owned restaurant.  Although the food is slightly overpriced, it is good.  Burgers are good, salmon is good, lettuce wraps are good, Moscow mules are good. The ambience is warm and cozy.  We usually sit in the bar and bartenders are attentive, accommodating, and friendly."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place because it is a close by and seemed to have a few unique and tasty menu items, but I really left without much of an impression at all.    Prowling the menu before our visit, I was very excited for the chicken risotto.  I'm admittedly a huge risotto fan-- and this one with bacon, asparagus, and onion straws sounded divine.    Upon receiving my order, I was very disappointed.  The chicken on top was cooked to a crisp, with completely blackened spots that were unedible.  Even the spots that weren't burnt were lacking in flavor and moisture, so it was really just dry, bland chicken. The risotto portion was okay, but way less flavorful than I imagined.  I might come back and try another menu item at another time if I'm looking for something nearby, but it definitely isn't something that I would crave."}
{"text":"Gosh has this place fallen from grace. We used to tell everybody about AJ's and bring friends and family. We had our Mother's Day brunch there last year and I've brought multiple friends for celebrations or causal dinners to catch up. However, the last couple times we've gone the food has changed for the worse and the staff has followed suit. The last time I was there was our last and final visit. My mom, my three year-old daughter and I stopped in for a quick lunch a couple weeks ago. Our daughter got the \"kids\" grilled cheese which was made with white cheese and super thick bread that made it hard for her to eat. It was a sandwich that would appeal maybe to an adult but not a three year-old who is used to \"standard\" kids grilled cheese which has American cheese and normal sized bread. My mom and I ordered the French dip which used to be an absolute favorite and it was AWFUL. First, we asked for the horseradish aioli to be on the side for both sandwiches and both came slathered with it plus some on the side. Second, the beef used to be really soft and thinly sliced but now it's thick and chewy. Our waitress did not return to our table after dropping off our plates for over 15 minutes. We picked around the horseradish and ate only a very small amount waiting for her to return. When the waitress finally returned we told her about the mistake and let her know we were generally unhappy with the sandwiches and would not be eating any further (napkins were on the plates at this point to signal we were not eating it). She told us she could have the cook re-make both sandwiches. At this point we'd been in the restaurant for over a half hour already. It took nearly 15 minutes (four games of I spy and two games of \"what's missing on the table\" with our 3 year-old) to get the first sandwiches. She said it would only take five minutes to make the sandwiches. The beef wasn't going to be any different and my three year-old wasn't interested in her adult grilled cheese and wanted to go. We declined a second round of sandwiches and told her we had to get going. She shrugged her shoulders and did nothing further to make it right or to reduce our bill. If you're willing to remake two sandwiches and spend the money to do that -- why couldn't you at least take one of them off the bill? So, I left a two dollar tip (more than I should have) and a note stating that it was a wholly disappointing visit and we were shocked that not even one of the sandwiches was taken off. I finished my note by saying there had been too many bad experiences lately and this last one was the final straw. You don't treat customers this way or you won't have any for long and you will all be out of a job. We will be letting everyone we know we retract our endorsement of this establishment. Such a shame."}
{"text":"I went to lunch with some co-workers today. Given that this is the same crew that dragged me to ZZ's Big Top for lunch a couple months ago, I must confess, my expectations were pretty low (and seeing a car parked on the sidewalk leading to the front door did little to encourage me). I had heard a lot about AJ's - what a great lunch place it was, how the steak sandwiches were the best, and how they closed to move and remodel. However, I was surprised when we walked through the front door and to find myself in an upscale, European dining hall. Okay, maybe it wasn't quite like that, but still more decorous than I expected. The waitress was very nice, and adding a cucumber to my ice water was a nice touch. For lunch I went with the French Dip sandwich, and it had the perfect balance of prime rib, horseradish, and mushrooms - complemented by a flavorful Au Jus sauce. Probably the best French Dip I have had in a long time. Nicely done."}
{"text":"This place is just incredibly average. Average food, average service. Nothing about it was really memorable or noteworthy. Weirdly tucked into a strip mall. I don't think I'll return with so many alternatives out in the Land."}
{"text":"Love ordering take out from here! All the food we've gotten has been very tasty and fresh. The pizza is one of my favorite things to get from here. I would recommend this place to any one looking for a good place to try."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and it never disappoints. The servers are usually friendly enough and the food is very good. I've had burgers and the pretzel crusted chicken. It's a very solid place with a nice atmosphere. It is becoming more of a go to for me."}
{"text":"We come here often. Not much to chose from locally. This place tries.  Service ok. Food just ok.  Not much else to say."}
{"text":"It's very challenging to review places on your birthday. While you are drowning in happiness and flowers, the last thing you want to do is to grab a pic of mac-n-cheese instead of your guests.   However through the blur of swirling happiness, I noticed couple of things: cocktails were weak, seafood mac-n-cheese was mediocre ( it's literally your Kraft mac-n-cheese with couple of shrimp), chicken strips were even more generic than mac-n-cheese. Good wine and service though. And my friend also had out of this world cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. However I always need more than just a cheeseburger to fall in love. I require exquisite appetizers and out of this world entrees. And of course I didn't go around the table asking my guests: \"What would you give your steak on the scale of 5?\" Even though God  knows was I tempted to do so when one of my guests looked all shocked after receiving his tini-tiny sirloin. His girlfriend elbowed his spleen and whispered: \" Its a sophisticated place. Don't make a scene. I'll feed you some potato chips in the car.\""}
{"text":"It is a very cool restaurant and the food is good. I have been there a couple of times and was always satisfied with the service and the food."}
{"text":"Good food especially the burgers.  And they have awesome daily specials.  Nice decor and friendly people."}
{"text":"As one who dines out more than I change my underwear, I really don't know why I haven't stopped by AJ's Urban Grill all this time i've been driving by.  Perhaps it's because it is in an unassuming strip mall?  In any case, I seized the opportunity when my hard to please, finicky 12 year old could not come up with an \"OK dad\", after exhaustively proposing about 10 different possibilities for dinner as we drove by the joint.  I said \"Let's try this Urban Grill place\", and surprisingly she said \"OK\".  I told her that if she doesn't like anything there, there are always her favorite McDonald's buttermilk chicken strips (kids will be kids) backup available nearby just down the road.  Cut to the chase:  she loved her gourmet burger and hand cut fries and my cajun rumba pasta was out of this world delicious!  They even prepared it without the italian sausage (I wanted just shrimp) for me!  The servers, service, and prep time was excellent as well, and their coffee even tasted real good.  All in all, a great, fun dining experience!  Places like AJ's Urban Grill is why I prefer local 'mom and pop' restaurants over the 'national or regional chains'."}
{"text":"French Dip sandwich was excellent.  Beef was tender and bread was fresh.  Atmosphere is energetic and medium loud.  Good for groups & families."}
{"text":"Food was really good - burgers were some of the best around, soup was homemade and had great flavor and the service was good! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"It's been since November of 2015 that we have had dinner at AJ's! Came in last Friday! Seemed like there was a whole new crew there on Fridays!   I will say, PERFECT service! Servers name was Jamie! She was A M A Z I N G! Personable, funny, intelligent, and so on top of everything! She is truly someone to keep around! A complete asset to a restaurant!   No complaints AT ALL! Good, service, price all great! Can't wait to come back again and see Jamie!"}
{"text":"I've been to AJ's Urban Grill a handful of times for lunch and once for after work drinks. I have always been seated right away. The food is fine, I usually get the portobello mushroom sandwich with fries. I've never heard anyone complain about their meal. It's the service that drives me crazy, so slow. Slow to get our waters, to get our other beverages, to take our order, to get our food, to get refills then to get our bill. Once it took so long to get our bill, I went out to look for our waitress. She was chit-chat to someone. Seriously. When we (coworkers and I) are deciding on lunch spots, AJ's is always mentioned but usually shot down because of the time it takes."}
{"text":"Our first time to go there, don't know how we have missed it. I had a Patty Melt & it was great, my husband had a Steak & Sausage Hoagie with waffle fries, he loved it.Service was very good & a nice drink and beer menu. We will be back soon"}
{"text":"When I'm on the road I am always looking for great local joints with a neighborhood bar feel, friendly staff and good food. AJ's hits on all of these. It has a cozy bar in the corner of the restaurant with a good OH brewery beer selection and good selection of wines.   On the recommendation of the bartender - who was a great fun gal, I went with one of the house specialties. The bone in porky chop with house rub and mushroom risotto. The pork chop was cooked perfectly - so many times restaurants kill pork. It was juicy and the rub was a perfect match. The risotto was packed with mushrooms and not too creamy.   I would definitely recommend AJ's to anyone in the West Lake area for business and looking for a great local joint.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went for my first time today during their lunch hour.  I loved the decor and atmosphere - very traditional and quaint.  I ordered the buffalo chicken salad which was delicious as were the rolls that came with it.  Our waitress was very nice and friendly, she also checked up on our table frequently.  She was a little slow but seemed to be new - she still did a nice job.  I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"Great vibe. You can be dressed up or dressed down, the food will be unbelievable and the environment seems to suit any occasion. This was my first time here. And I'm upset I didn't discover this place sooner. My girlfriend and I had crab cakes that were delicious. They had one of our favorite Malbecs on the menu: Trivento. I had wings and consider myself a wing connoisseur. I've been to so many places where the wings were small, overcooked, etc. These were huge, meaty, and cooked perfectly. I've had wings where the server claimed they were hot only to be disappointed. I had the Suicide wings and they were the best wings I've ever had. Super hot, but not too much. I also had the Pretzel Crusted Chicken which came with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. Phenomenal. Chicken was tender and delicious. My girlfriend had the Ciabatta Steak sandwich and she loved it. I finished our meal off with homemade Sugar Cookie Cheesecake. Absolutely delicious. We will be coming back here often. Loved it. Beth was excellent as well. Overall, an incredible dining experience. Very impressed."}
{"text":"Wow!  Great food, warm service (thanks, Jody!), huge menu, great buzzy atmosphere.  (Whoever said it's never crowded wasn't there on a Wednesday, when wine bottles are half price.)  Many in our party had great entrees but the urban fettucini took the prize.  Our waitress recommended it and she was right."}
{"text":"Love this place , the staff, the food , and the owners. It's family owned , which makes it easy to support! They food is always on par and the drinks are always perfect! They have very well staffed restaurant and there's not much of wait to get seated . If there is a wait, the bar is always there! Taco night - Thursday is my night! I'm from Texas and these are by far the best tacos I have found here in Ohio! Add that to great happy hours and half priced bottles of wine and you cannot go wrong. Also the decor is super modern with a rustic feel , and it's very clean and organized ."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick lunch in between basketball games. The service was fast and friendly and the food was fresh and delicious. The cook inadvertently applied suicide sauce to the wings instead of hot barbecue but our gracious server took care of it. We definitely recommend this spot and would definitely return."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC FOOD! Great atmosphere and even better food. What more could I ask for?! My boyfriend gets tired of me suggesting we go here for every meal. Go eat their food now!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my wife and her parents. The atmosphere is very warm and welcoming. We were seated almost immediately. Our server was Sandy, and to be honest one of the best servers I've ever encountered. Very knowledgeable about the menu and had great recommendations. Since we were there on a Monday which was pizza night we decided to try it. Let me say that we had two pizza's, one pepperoni and one pepperoni and sausage. Both pizzas were fantastic. Definitely will be coming back for pizza night with the family. All in all great food and great service."}
