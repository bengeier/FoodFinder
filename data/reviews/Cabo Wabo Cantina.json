{"text":"The 2-for-1 margarita special was a total rip off; they just doubled their prices for the 10oz plastic cups of margaritas.  But that wasn't the worst of it.  I happened to notice that they charged me $1.00 more on each of our entrees than the price listed on the menus.  When I talked to the manager about it, he said it wasn't a mistake.  He said that the prices changed, but they didn't have the new menus printed yet.  Apparently he saw absolutely no problem with charging all of his patrons more than what they thought they'd pay.  When I mentioned to him that this is clearly unethical, he just said that he'll make it up to me by giving me $25 off my next meal.  In other words, \"shut up about it, and I'll make it worth your while.\"  I told him I didn't want his coupon, and that he should just do the right thing and either lower his prices to reflect what's on the menu, or tell his patrons about the increase when they order.  I don't think he listened to me.  Just think of the thousands of people who paid more than the menu price.  Can I hear \"Class Action Lawsuit\"?"}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple.. If you are in Vegas, you are better off drinking in your room than coming to CWC. 

+ margaritas are pretty good
+ chips were stale and salsa was not that tasty
+ service SUCKS - slow and rude.

We came to Cabo Wabo Cantina because we had a 2 for 1 margarita coupon. Thank goodness, we didn't eat there because the food did not look very good and would probably not settle well in our stomachs. And to top it off, the service was HORRIBLE! Our waiter was rude and seemed pissed off that we were there. He did not even bother to ask us what type of margarita we wanted. Instead, he just got us the flavor that was most convenient for him. 

I'm happy I now know not to ever come back here again!"}
{"text":"Great patio with people watching on the strip. Love the sampler platter and the lobster enchiladas. The service is usually pretty good but in the summer make sure you are under an umbrella."}
{"text":"I give this place five stars it is delicious and the jalape√±o margaritas are awesome their fajitas with chicken beef and shrimp off the hook....... there service was excellent I loved it beautiful view also of the strip...."}
{"text":"The hubby and I stopped here during a quick-but-epic 4-day Vegas run. Despite being an open-air setup, the outdoor area was perplexingly stifling. Tables were crammed together uncomfortably, and there was very little air movement. The tabletop was sticky, which I attribute to the tacky finish rather than uncleanliness....but I could be wrong. More importantly, though, anyone who is in Vegas on a budget (and we DO exist) should not step foot in this place. Overpriced-but-average bar food and drinks are not my thing! Our margaritas were $15 a pop, but not overly large, strong....or good. At that price, that drink should give me a back rub, or at least a kiss!

In short, SKIP IT."}
{"text":"We recently stayed at Planet Hollywood, and found ourselves with a group at Cabo Wabo.  The people we were with sucked, so the manager, Lou, and bartenders John and Nikki were AMAZING.  John made us the best bloody marys we've ever had - we like them super spicy - and showed us a great time.  We went back the next 2 days to have Lou treat us wonderfully.  The service was fantastic, drinks were great, and the food that we did eat was enjoyable.  Having such a great experience here definitely added to our already wonderful trip!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner on the rail last night and it was Awesome. Laura was are server and she made our date night and experience at Cabo. We will be back! 
The chips and salsa is super yummy, but Laura truly made us feel at home

See you Sunday for lunch on the patio!"}
{"text":"Two and a half stars, actually. Adequate food, excellent service, $15 slushies called \"margaritas\" that taste nothing like a margarita. An annoying fee they add to the bill that we had to Google, and it seems it's a fee they charge you just to eat at their restaurant. If you don't mind getting ripped off and you stick with beer, it's not a bad place."}
{"text":"Just went for drinks. Great view of the strip of you stay outside. Bahama mama was delicious. Also had very good live band."}
{"text":"Was here during a hot summer day and the place had a great view at the outside bar and seemed to be very vibrant. Once we walked in to the restaurant it was a different story. I soon found out why. I ordered the charcoal tacos. I think that was the name. Then again, who cares! It was disgusting. My GF had the sopes and man they were bad. The thing was as hard as a rock. Back to my tacos. If you can't even properly warm up a tortilla you shouldn't even bother working at a restaurant. The worst place I ever dined out was a place here in Chicago that I really thought was unbeatable. Until I met Cabo Wabo. Food is just brutal. I was waiting on Gordon Ramsey to walk out the kitchen. Doesn't even deserve any compliments of any kind with that kind of food."}
{"text":"This place has the worst food on the planet. Take this as an indicator: the chips and salsa were horrible, the drinks were flat, and there was a blatant typo on the menu. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE! TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT! I wish I had read the reviews to this place! What a huge mistake!  We ordered 2 large margarita's and 2 waters, about 10 or 15 minutes go by and the server returns to take our order when she stil has not even brought us our water or our margarita's, we place our order and she say's she'll be back with our drinks....about 20-25 miutes later here is our food being brought out by someone else, still no water, still no maragrita's yep kind annoyed so we begin eating I mean we're hungry right, the waitress passes by again and again we finish our food STILL NO WATER & NO MARGARITA'S Well now we are done eating and STILL NO WATER & NO MARGARITA'S  well by now I obviously ask to speak with a manager, well he could care less and the jerk (the manager, tall guy dark skin dark hair maybe 23 or 25) thought we we're gonna pay for our margarita's ummmmm excuse me and when did either one of us drink one??? so yep payed for our food full price had dry mouth and left so if you go to this place good luck hope your not thirsty!"}
{"text":"We loved this place...good for out of towners who want to experince the strip while eating, drinking and especially talking about everyone who walks by...lol. You can watch the water show from the railing seating and the food was great, along with the service."}
{"text":"I was treated really unfair at this place. The waitress recommended a non alcoholic drink to my 2 friends, they both ordered it. When I was presented the check, those drinks were $13 each. I was stunted. How can be a non alcoholic drink so expensive. I complain and demand not to pay for it. They said the price includes the glass, but we were not warned or told. I said I will pay for the drink but not the glass, they will call the police if I don't pay for the glass. And recommend me to read the menu before ordering. What ahole. Ok I paid the tab but no tip. If they just more friendly not to charge me for the glass, I will easily pay them $25 in tip. Dumb people. By the way, the food is not worth anyone's time to go. Overall , avoid it if you can."}
{"text":"Greasy eggs, Who can screw up toast? it  tasted funny and had to be sent back! 
Really bad service - no tip here!
Walk around this one! It is probably a better bar!"}
{"text":"So...after four days of trying to contact this place, they finally recognized their own mistake and credited my account for the tab I was charged for that wasn't mine.  Glad to have my money back but it doesn't make up for lousy service and bad food."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner (Halloween) - thought it was a cool place.

Sat at the bar and the bar girl was really friendly.

People everywhere celebrating Halloween, so was fun to watch.

Cocktails there were lovely, especially the freshly made pina colada - a definite hit!

My husband ordered the steak burrito and said it was lovely.  Nice big chunks of meat and a good flavour.

I ordered the prawn in lime appetizer as wasn't too hungry.  Prawns were lovely and fresh but the whole dish tasted so strongly of lime I couldn't finish the meal - it was so over powering!  The paella rice was lovely and moist and fresh.

When the bill came it turned out she had given us the main course option of the prawn and rice dish, when I specifically asked for the small appetizer version.  We did wonder why it was so large - but left it as you can never tell with some portion sizes.

I would have rated it higher had it not been for the appalling lime flavoured prawn dish and the bar girl serving and charging us for the wrong size.

I would recommend this place for a drink."}
{"text":"Just back from Vegas and wanted to say how much my boyfriend and I enjoyed Cabo Wabo. Service was great (thanks Sara!), loved the patio right on the strip, and the food was awesome.  Boyfriend had the Cobb salad and I had El-Green-go Burrito. Both yummy. I recommend the flight of Cabo Wabo tequila if you want to try them all.  A really good value."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a drink or for outdoor eating on the strip! Food is average, nothing special but not bad at all. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Of all the various ethnic cuisines, \"Mexican\" food is the one I have the most difficulty forking over lots of money. Simply put, there is nothing you can put on 10 nacho chips that makes it worth $15 unless you're replacing the cheese with liquid gold. Then there's the issue of charging $33 dollars for a large margarita..."}
{"text":"As far as people watching on the Strip is concerned, Cabo Wabo fits the bill perfectly. It's right out front of Planet Hollywood and across from the Cosmopolitan. 
My sister and I visited for lunch on a beautiful Vegas day. We really could have sat out all afternoon in the sunshine checking out the crazies walking by, with our margaritas and mojito's. 
Food is not amazing and service was slow on this particular day but we were in no hurry so it didn't really matter. It did take a while just to have our drinks arrive. They were worth the wait in the end!"}
{"text":"Average food, really noisy and too expensive, didn't like it at all. Pros: quick service and friendly waitress, good location."}
{"text":"Came for New Year's Eve

Pros:
- fish and chips are delicious
- fried ice cream is the bomb!!
- great atmosphere
- fantastic customer service 
- no wait time 
- easy parking

Cons:
- tacos were mieh; had much better for much cheaper
- they charge 5% Concession and Franchise fee on every check
- the windows facing the bellagio fountains are deliberately blocked so you can't watch

Overall still a good experience, would have been 5 stars if not for the cons listed above."}

{"text":"We had a party of 12  last night  after my sisters wedding  8/15/15 the waiter seemed to be a little nervous,clumsy  or something  he dropped a few plates that fell all over hitting my husband in the  back and almost cutting my leg just a little  scrap  but the manager there didn't really seem to be concerned  he just said \"O let me help clear the table\"... smh"}
{"text":"Great food.   Great staff.   Great service.  Great happy hours.   If you like good rock music and great food this is the place!!!!  Rock on!"}
{"text":"Came here on a busy night with a large group and the girls up front accommodated us very well.  The vibe was also excellent loved the music they were playing. Now on to the food and drinks, the food was not that great since it's suppose to be mexican it really didn't hit the spot for me who puts crumbled cheese on rice... :/ the drink I got was pretty average nothing I haven't tasted before and everything was a little overpriced but come on it's Vegas what isn't overpriced ."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere. If you want amazing food overlooking the great backdrop of beautiful Vegas hotels, CABO is the place.

The chips and salsa are a must. The quesadilla was so delicious and yummy. The carne asada tacos are so good.

Our waiter, Danny, was amazing, made our experience first time being at the place amazing with no hiccups or any problems. Kudos!!!!

Definite stop if your ever in the Las Vegas strip."}
{"text":"First came here years ago when they first opened to support dueling piano friends who did a gig here. Last nights visit was a result of a Groupon purchased in November 2014 with a Xmas Eve expiry.  Cabo Wabo may be a hit elsewhere but in Vegas I'd have to say its an epic fail. Located at Planet Hollywood this place is H U GE! 

Multi level; huge outside seating area with a great views of the Bellagio Fountains. The restaurant itself occupies the ground floor. There is a stage, lots of tables with limited room to walk around. There is a lift and stairs to take you to the levels above. What is up there I don't know. I suspect a club and/or private rooms. Not exactly sure. What I am sure if is people were constantly on the move, up/down the stairs, causing quite the fuss. 

The music here is loud. Really loud for a restaurant. We were yelling at each other to be heard, as were other diners & staff. The restaurant & outdoor bar weren't busy so I'm not sure why our server Victoria took forever to greet & take our drink order. She was very nice though.  Lots or servers to be seen but none to be found. Food coming from the kitchen was ridiculously slow. 

I had the BBQ bacon cheeseburger & my friend had the Cilantro jalape√±o chicken breast. Hers was served with onion rings. Sadly, upon biting into one she immediately pulled a chicken bone from within the ring. Fortunately her temp crown from a root canal wasn't damaged. We still can't figure out how this happened. 

I order my burger med-well. Since it took forever for our food to come out I was hopeful the burger was properly cooked bSadly it arrived cooked LESS THAN medium. It was gross. The fries tasted like fish. It took a good 15-20 minutes to get our server. Why I don't know. Numerous servers walked by our table & never stopped to ask if there was a problem. It was obvious there was...both plates pushed away from us, untouched. 

Eventually Victoria arrived, along with a manager. He was quite gracious. Free margaritas & a redo on our food. Fortunately they both arrived properly done. 

Dare I mention there were other diners standing on the tables dancing?  Security guards putting on their own dance act, sitting down, hanging out with friends or trying to pick up girls. 

This place is a joke. Ok food not worth the wait or pricing. Irritatingly loud music. TONS of empty tables, inside & out. Bathrooms were disgusting: water & used towels everywhere. Servers galore but of no use. 

Not my sort of place. Not what I expect to see or experience when I go to dinner. No wonder they ran a Groupon. This place is awful.  If you're a local like me, there are better places off strip to go. If you're a young, classless, dumb tourist wanting to do nothing but show your ass, spit, & get drunk...then this place is great for you.  FAMILIES STRONGLY DISCOURAGED."}
{"text":"Always a great time here!!! As Vegas locals we love going to the strip and eating delicious food this place NEVER disappoints it's sooooooo good.  The drinks as well are always good especially the pitcher of the lemonade and iced tea vodka with mint we can't get enough!!! I know it has a name but my husband and I just say mint iced tea pitcher and they know what we mean of course we are there all the time haha.  We love Saturdays especially when the guitarist Shawn is there he is awesome!!!! And soooo good he makes hanging on the patio even more enjoyable!!!!! This is definitely a MUST when your down in the strip good times and a good crowd!!"}
{"text":"Margaritas were delicious, and the food was average tex-mex. Definitely not as good as a hole in the wall mexican place, but it did the trick when we were just off the plane and looking for a decent meal and some drinks! I would recommend for a casual lunch."}
{"text":"Yep. Happy hour on the patio on a beautiful day while on vacation with my Hubs and some friends. Wine, people watching on the Strip, friends, sunshine and $3.00 street tacos. What could be better? 

The service is very friendly and the atmosphere is rock and roll. There is both inside and outside seating options. Happy hour options change periodically. 

Had a great time and have the t-shirt to prove it. (Literally... made my Hubs buy me a t-shirt!)"}
{"text":"I came into into Cabo with my fianc√© and friends. Our server was Yesenia. She was on point with everything, went above and beyond for all of us. From appetizers, to meal, and drinks. She was very attentive and friendly, made us all feel very welcomed and important. The margaritas were very tasty and Sammy  tequila shrimp amazing."}
{"text":"Went to Cabo Wabo tonight for a Vegas Young Professionals event, at first I thought I was in the wrong place because hidden far in the miracle mile shops it can be a bit confusing. The outside looks like any other \"frozen\" bar you would encounter on the strip. I walked up to the hostess stand and asked \"where is the restaurant\" she pointed down a long hallway. 

The restaurant itself is pretty small but it does have two levels. The second level seems to be a banquet/rental area and this is where our event was held. I had a margarita and while it was decent it was way too sweet and syrup-y for my tastes. A friend ordered a vodka soda and we were both shocked to find out the tiny little 8oz cup w/one shot costs $14!!! I have paid less at a nightclub! That's where the place lost two stars, I understand you're a strip bar but come on! $10 would even be an insult. 

I tried a piece of pizza and some taquitos, they were pretty good but I didn't sample the actual menu. The music was way too loud for a networking event or even sitting down to dinner. Overall this place has potential if they lower their prices."}
{"text":"This place is good, but not great.  We went on a sunday afternoon.  The dining room was packed but they seemed to be a little short staffed on servers.  We waited quite a while between seeing out server.  Our server was very nice, however, and accommodating.

As for the fare; my lady had a margarita on the rocks and said it was quite good.  I had a beer, so not much to say about that.  She had the tortilla soup and loved it, especially given how cold it was outside.  Her daughter had the carne asada tacos and gave them a glowing review.  I had a cheeseburger with fries and found it to be quite good.  I found the prices to be a bit on the high side for what you get.

It looks like they may have live music in the evenings, there was a stage with a drum kit set up.  

I'd give a few more stars if the service had been a bit quicker and the prices a bit lower."}
{"text":"I ate here with my two brothers since it was opened  by one of the members of Van Halen.  I didn't bother to check Yelp because I assumed that all expensive restaurants on the Strip are equally good.  The bottom line here is that while the food is good, I'm not quite sure it's worth the price even with the Strip mark-up.  We split a margarita pitcher for $36, which was very tasty, although again I felt it was a little pricy. 

The chips and salsa are AMAZING.  They're cut thicker than regular tortilla chips and fried perfectly.  The salsa has a wonderful tang.  You should definitely pass on the guacamole, as it doesn't have nearly enough lime or cilantro and is bland.

I got the chicken burrito enchilada-style, aka covered in cheese.  It was tasty if slightly bland.  I'd recommend it as one of the cheaper things on the menu at around $16.  My brother got the fish tacos, which he said were amazing but wasn't able to finish because he ate so many chips.

Service was good, not super attentive but not bad as others have mentioned.  I sat outside and it was thunderously loud but that's the strip for you.  The waitresses appeared to be having fun and dancing to the music.  Overall it was a nice ambience, overlooking the strip with a direct view of the Bellagio fountains.

Bottom line: I'd recommend this place for the food but for the price point you could probably find better or more interesting food of another genre elsewhere on the strip."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! I ordered a chicken taco
Salad and guacamole and chips which I ate it all! Went for my Aunts wedding rehearsal dinner and for a party of 50..service was great, brought the food out pretty quick, great portions ..my only word of advice and warning would be don't trust the gorgeous light skinned waitress with no clothes on. I asked her for help on a place for our whole family to go and she recommended a strip club, acted as though she was helping us by getting is a limo and free entry...and it turned out to be a total scam. We ended up all the way at the club and having to turn right back out take a taxi back to the hotel will definitely dine here again but I hope I don't run into her because I'm still bee upset."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was not impressed with food quality. I had only ever been to the Cabo San Lucas location, and hoped it was isolated. Food was not great, service was barely available and drinks were ok."}
{"text":"Summer Rhodes is the best manager. She's great, two of us spilled our tequila shots and she was there to rescue our day! She's extremely professional, and knows how to handle customer service so much! She's literally AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa, Yummy! The guacamole is just a plus and the Margarita I got for checking in on yelp is pretty amazing and so is Brian, our server."}
{"text":"Food sucked. No alcohol in the pitcher of margarita!!!
Great place for people watching."}
{"text":"Bought two $16 slushie drinks, no alcohol in them
Go to Fat Tuesday's instead"}
{"text":"My favorite food place in Las Vegas  . I can go multiple times my whole trip . I have good cravings for their nachos , add chicken.  Best food spot on the strip . with good drinks and great service . I love sitting outside looking out at the Las Vegas strip ."}
{"text":"Best service ever and our bartender ashley was the best!!! Definetley coming back! Also to the manager sumer who was great to us thank you!"}
{"text":"Cabo Wabo is pretty average as far as mexican food goes. Don't come here expecting to be blown away bu the food. The atmosphere helps a lot with your experience.  They play current pop music but then could have a band one night and then a solo artist the next. The patio area is open and has a pretty good view of the Bellagio and Cosmopolitan.  

I was there with a small group of 5 and we only had to wait about 15 minutes on a Saturday night. Not bad. There is no complimentary chips and salsa but we ordered some anyway along with guacamole. The chips were above average and I would buy a bag if they sold them. The salsa wasn't bad either. Once everyone at the table realized the guacamole I ordered was $9, they stopped and let me eat it. I also ordered a bloody mary. One thing I have found recently is that mexican joints have some of the best bloody marys. This proved to be true once again.

I had the chicken sabana which was like nothing I've ever experienced at a mexican restaurant. My wife had the carnitas tacos which she could not finish. Not because they give you a lot but there was a strange taste that did not agree with her. I tried a piece and was glad I ordered what I did. 

With that said, if I'm in the area and looking for a cool atmosphere with decently priced food, I would try them again."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worse expiriences of my life.......we get there and they say \"yall want inside or outside \" we say inside please  we get seated inside only to find roaches crawling on the wall sooooo disturbing and beyond nasty we all get up and go to the front and say we are  leaving and ask for a Manger only to be told sorry we just sprayed the restaurant so they are probably coming out.... that's not ok nly disrespectful but nasty in every sense shape or form!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It took a long time just to get our drink order. The menu items average around $15 a piece and the margaritas were $11. The margarita was just average. The chips and salsa were below average. I got the \"Street Tacos\" and the meat in the taco was not good and chewy. We got to sit outside and view of the strip earned them a star. I would not recommend this to anyone unless they wanted to drink an average margarita with a view."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE.
LONG WAIT OF 40mins just for tacos & salad.

We were here enjoying LV trip and stopped by here for lunch. We had to wait 10mins to get the waiter come to take order an bring waters.
We sat first the other people came around us. Of course we ordered first but we were the last ones to get the food which is just tacos and salad, nothing else.

We feel like we wasted time here that we could spend somewhere else to enjoy lunch and we certainly WON'T be back here again. 
The service is just terrible."}
{"text":"Cool spot for lunch outside on the strip with a great view, large portions so bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"Don't bother.  Food was expensive and nothing special, and service was abysmal.  Manager didn't seem to care.  We waited forever for drinks, had to flag our server down for refills, and waited again another 15 minutes for those.  Watched tables all around us get the wrong food orders - two lonely burritos checked into every table and I'm not sure they ever found a home.  Not a good experience at all... We won't be back... Ever."}
{"text":"After wandering the strip, we decided to eat here before our show. The service was okay and the view was nice on the patio to see the Bellagio foundations. But the food was completely overpriced - even for Vegas. The quesadilla we ordered for $10 only had two miniscule wedges. Choose a different place for dinner!"}
{"text":"Food was lackluster. Service was slow and unorganized.  Typical Vegas over-priced.  The only redeeming quality is the view of the Bellagio fountains."}
{"text":"The view of the strip was awesome from this spot we found walking the strip. Although we couldn't get a table right at the edge the staff was very accommodating. Just can't drink their water!lol"}
{"text":"Great service, good drinks, good food! Chicken tequila was excellent, the tacos were great and that atmosphere was fun!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. Bartender was laughing on his phone while we were patiently waiting for our order to be taken. Then he wanted me to yell my order across the loud bar to him while he continued to stay on his phone. Very inconsiderate. Worst tortilla soup I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Looks like a tourist trap....

My friends are big fans of Sammy so they wanted to check this place out.

- it was cold and drafty inside. It was a very cold Thanksgiving week but come on... keep your patrons warm
- Music was... top 40. Sammy probably would shoot himself if he heard it.
+/- there was a group of obnoxious tourists standing up on their chairs and screaming every five minutes. I get it...it's Vegas but what's the point of that act?"}
{"text":"We were a group of seven who went here... 

We were told that there would be a table available in 15-20 minutes. When 25 minutes had passed, I asked the waiter very politely when we would expect our table and pointed out that we had been waiting for 25 minutes. She gave a very rude answer, which were something like: \"I told you it would be 20 minutes and you have definitely not waited 25 minutes.\" After that I was baffled. Who treats their customers that way? Right after she finished the sentence another waiter comes up with menus and says that the table is available. I turn around to call my friends over. Meanwhile the first waitress is saying: \"Are you coming or what!? she is waiting for you. Go go go.\" In a really hush and angry voice, and the other waiter were off before we had a chance to follow her. 

We were all in some sort of chock; we have never experienced anything like this before. We decided to find another place to eat breakfast after that introduction."}
{"text":"The food was pretty tasty and the atmosphere was fun. We were in early Sunday and they had a great entertainer playing guitar and singing, it was very enjoyable. We had a couple of margaritas, a couple of shots, a salad and Sammy's Shrimp (Which was fantastic by the way) and our waiter was great. The whole experience sounds great right?

Well it was until I got the bill. 160 pre-tip. The lesson we learned was not to let someone else pick our tequila shots for us lest we pay 14 dollars per shot.

Par for the course in Vegas I guess. Still, I would go back looking for Mexicanesque food, just that I might fill up on chips and beer buckets."}
{"text":"Cabo Wabo is a great one of the coolest places in Las Vegas. Their food is delicious, great service(which is very hard to get in LV) live music on Sundays, one of the best views to Bellagio fountain. Check this place out. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Awesome experience!  The outside deck was pretty full so we went inside instead.  It was still a fun environment.  The waiter was friendly, food was out in less than 10 minutes and it was delicious. We would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour...but the happy hour sucked! My friend and I came here because we saw online that there were $2 tacos during happy hour. Not true. There was only $5 shots and a certain beer for happy hour. No discount on any other drinks. The tacos and ceviche were decent, but I wouldn't come back just for that. For locals, there are a ton of other good Taco Tuesday Happy Hours in this city."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere... Bad service. Didn't receive our appetizer and our orders came out incorrect. Ran out of beverages and did not get checked on once. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Took my husband here last weekend ( he hasn't been to Vegas since 2006). 
We both LOVE the frozen lime margs and be careful of on the rocks style (POTENT)!

It was busy about 1230 in the afternoon...but we got seated quickly outside and order drinks right away...we had to ask 20 minutes for chips and salsa. Other than that we both had the Cobb with Chicken.  Large salads with fresh tasting veggie, generous meat and very moist!  WE loved it.

Try to get outside -its great people watching for sure!

We will go back in Sept for our anniversay and it's the first place we plan on hitting once we check in to our hotel!"}
{"text":"Lame bar...nothing like Cabo Wabo in Baja or Tahoe. I mean seriously on the Strip in Vegas and no music on the patio, because the speakers are blown! Come on Sammy this bar is a joke....no live music??? karaoke on the Vegas strip, save your money and go anywhere else!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here in the past and had wonderful experiences, and even though I know there are tourist prices on some things they hadn't be outrageous in the past. Tonight everything changed.

I took my daughter and one of her sorority sisters out to eat and celebrate the end of finals week. Looking over the menu, I decided to have a Coors Lt. draft from the bar after seeing most beers on draught were $8 and then ordered my hamburger as I wasn't in the mood for what you would normally get at a Mexican restaurant. My daughter and her friend had water to drink and we also ordered queso and chips as an appetizer.

It was an unusually cool night dining outside, but I knew they had heaters outside and didn't think twice about it. We asked if they could turn on the heaters and wouldn't you know, all the heaters around us came on except the ones directly above us. We were later given an explanation of they were shorted out. Really? Don't know about others, but it made me want to leave as quickly as possible. (Props to our server who did move us to a warmer area, but it was still lacking and the only reason this review is not a one-star review).

When my beer did arrive, it came in an unusually large hurricane glass. When the bill did come, my $8 Coors Lt draft was now $18. Our party of 3 w/ 1 alcoholic drink and 2 waters was over $90. Again, I know eating on the strip isn't going to be extra cheap, but damn that's just gouging to be gouging to make $$$.

It was the last time I will pay to eat there."}
{"text":"Great place for people watching. Although, they continue to have slow service. The drinks run dry. You should not have to flag your waiter down or get the hostess to take your drink order. But I come back for the atmosphere and location. They would get a 5 star if they would get the service down."}
{"text":"Second time here. First in 2012. Food not impressive. Fish tacos are much better elsewhere. Pork tacos were crazy plain."}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks because of the great location. Ended up staying way longer than expected due to the GREAT service at the bar. Becca was awesome."}
{"text":"The food here was good. I love Mexican food and honestly they didn't disappoint. My husband and I shared an asada burrito and had a few drinks to enjoy the reason I will encourage anyone to dine here. The people watching was some of the best. Sit on the ledge wall where you can drink and watch the spectacle of people that cattle herd by. 

There was great entertainment and we could have honestly sat here for hours! 

The Bellagio water/light show goes off every 1/2 hour so we were able to enjoy that as well."}
{"text":"My sister and I found ourselves quite thirsty after making the trek from the Mirage to Planet Hollywood, so we stopped in here for some drinks. I am really picky about my alcoholic beverages, and I have to say that the pineapple mango mojito was THE BEST mojito I have ever had. My sister enjoyed her beers, and we were both crazy about the complementary chips and salsa. The salsa was just incredible, just a little different from the norm, and thoroughly enjoyable.

The atmosphere was nice, as we had a nice sunny spot at the edge of the restaurant, outside, with a view. A great spot to relax and people-watch.

UPDATE: I changed my review from 5 stars to 3 after trying their food. Nothing terrible, but I would not eat there again. We also ate inside this time, which was a little tacky. In the future, I would come again only for drinks, and to sit outside and people watch."}
{"text":"JR Rocks!!! His recommendations on food were awesome! He was a little apprehensive on making a \"Liquid Marijuana Shot\" but we convinced him it would be worth it! His execution was flawless!!!"}
{"text":"After years of wanting to try I finally remembered to make a point to go here while visiting a city that has one.  I was surprisingly disappointed, especially expecting one of the best to be on the Las Vegas strip.  The staff was friendly but service a little slow which was surprising, the visit was at 1am when only the bar area was open.  The appetizer sampler was alright, but at $24 nothing special, just the usual items.  I would not have been able to tell the difference between it and your usual rinky dinky Mexican restaurants back home.  Now the real reason I went was for Sammy's Cabo Wabo tequila, I ordered one on the rocks ($14).  Who knows if they used the real stuff, but it tasted like cheap tequila, or was extremely watered down already.  My other half had a house frozen margarita ($10), and I swear there wasn't a drop of alcohol in it, just mix and ice.  Total bill for 2 drinks and appetizer with tax, tip and some CNF charge(?)= $60.  So disappointed in Sammy, wish he would make sure the quality stays competitive."}
{"text":"While taking a visitor to see the Bellagio - and with a 2-year old in tow, we looked for a quick dinner spot that can easily accomodate a toddler.  We turned around from the Bellagio fountains and saw Cabo Wabo and decided to check out the prices.  On a Monday evening around 6pm the place was pretty empty and we sat inside.  The service was excellent and overall we had a very enjoyable dinner experience and I will return to eat here.  Now, the food is a bit overpriced for casual mexican-fare - but this is a Strip-facing restaurant and overpriced food is just normal.  If you live here, you know this well and can't exactly fault the place for it.  If the prices are too much for you, go find a mexican restaurant inside a not-so-popular hotel.  

We started with the fresh guacamole and it was simply wonderful and fantastic and worth the splurge if more than one person will eat it.  I had two margaritas ($12.00 each) - both of which were very good and large.  I ordered the shrimp tacos ($16.00) and each taco had 5-6 wonderfully breaded shrimp.  They were excellent!!   My brother in law had the Mahi Mahi tacos ($16.00) and he LOVED them!!   We also order off the kids menu for our toddler - which is often ridiculous of us because she doesn't eat that much - but we did.  The kids menu is very diverse with many options and the serving side was almost like an adult portion.  What she didn't eat, my brother in law finished off - so it didn't go to waste!  

All in all this was a great dining experience - and great for families with kids.  We will be returning here the next time we need a quick meal near the Bellagio."}
{"text":"We ended up at Cabo Wabo because it was around midnight Sunday night and several other places we tried were closed or had long waits.  Cabo Wabo did not, and that should have sent a red flag immediately.  There was a pretty terrible karaoke band playing, and they were far too loud for a small place.  The waitress took awhile to take our order, and when asked what was good or recommended we were met with a blank stare.  She did not want to be there.  We ordered a couple margaritas and they were OK, but far too expensive.  When our food finally came, it was a little cold and just so-so.  I had the nacho plate thing (forgot what it was called) with the 12 chips, and it barely had any fajita meat on it.  Once we finished eating I waited a good 30 minutes to get my check, all while my ear drums were bleeding from the awful music.  My wife ended up going back to the hotel because the check took forever.  Overall, it was pretty bad food, bad environment, overpriced, and OK drinks.  You can do a lot better on the strip.  Heck, you can do better at a truck stop in the middle of Iowa."}
{"text":"Up until now, I've been mostly disappointed with 'celebrity' bars and restaurants.  Most are big on name hype, low on flavor.  Cabo Waco Cantona changed that for me.  The drinks area bit pricey, however, they did deliver on flavor and size.  The Queso Fundida was cheesy and a good portion for an appetizer.  The jalape√±o line chicken was large enough for two, and not SO spices that it was inedible.  Plenty of Sammy memorabilia and a great waitstaff make this a sure bet on the Vegas strip (sorry, couldn't avoid the pun!)"}
{"text":"Food was great! Only reason I give them four stars was because they messed up my friends order but overall food was delicious :)"}
{"text":"The food was terrible do not eat at this restaurant. When the sever asked how our food was, I had to tell her It was not good at all. She looked at me and nodded as if to say I know. Go for drinks that's all."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch because I was going to a conference next door at Paris. I guess since we were a group of ten and the server knew he'd be getting automatic gratuity he figured he didn't need to put forth much effort. It took 10 minutes to get our drink order, then another 10 to take our food order...about 30 to get the food-you see where I am going with this? All of the waitstaff seemed to not want to make eye contact with the patrons for fear they may get asked for anything. The server only checked on us once about 15 minutes after the food had come out which to me was unacceptable, especially because they weren't busy. It took another 20 minutes to get the check. The food was terrible. I got beef tacos and the beef tasted like how dog food smells if that makes sense. An overall horrible lunch with horrible service and horrible food. Plus overpriced. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Greasy chips
Weird, sour ceviche
No ability to do a blended drink other than their pre-made mixed stuff they keep in a slushie machine.
Overstretched waiters who can't seem to get back to your table with the drink you ordered 30 minutes ago.
Nobody in my party of 5 was especially happy with their meal. 
BUT, it did have a nice outdoor patio looking out on the strip and the Bellagio fountains. The view was worth 2 stars."}
{"text":"Over-priced, medicore, pre-prepared food. Inattentive, disorganized staff. Lame."}
{"text":"Wish I had read the reviews first before dining here...

We stopped here for a quick lunch and a drink. Service wasn't bad, though the waiters were all awkwardly sitting at a table near the entrance just talking and waiting around. It was around 11am when we stopped in, so not super busy, but it was weird to have them just all sitting at a table.

The food was a bit expensive for what it was. I ended up getting the carne asada tacos -- not anything amazing or memorable. Roberto's Tacos off the strip is a much better choice. The margarita was strong, but also not amazing taste. Our bill for tacos, a salad, 2 margaritas and 2 bloody marys was $100. 

I'd pass on this place during future visits and try something else."}
{"text":"Please don't waste your time and money at this place!! We got there had to wait 10 minutes then when we got seated we seen that there were plenty of tables available they just didn't want to sit us! Then after waiting ten minutes for a single order of drinks they gave us flat pop. We walked out!! Not worth the price at all pease don't waste your money!! Go some where else!!"}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the price. We were expecting better (I don't know why) but left disappointed. Didn't know we were getting a souvenir glass with our double drinks, and certainly would have declined. Now I have to throw them away, or figure how to pack them so they won't break in our luggage. A heads-up from the server would have been nice. Overall, just okay."}
{"text":"sitting out on the patio on the vegas strip with a margarita and some nachos...little bit of heaven!  Nachos were big though...plenty to take back to the hotel for a midnight snack!"}
{"text":"Fun, affordable & delicious. A bit loud for the older set but great music, free shots, and more food than you can eat. Family of 4 ate for less than $50."}
{"text":"Worst mexican food I have ever had!! Don't go here. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"A big rock star owns this place, I forget who, my friend knows.  The biggest draw of this place is that you can eat while you look out on the strip, so the view is fantastic.  That makes this really worth it.  Food is also good.  I recommend a salad (forget which it was but it was chopped and had avocado...) and drinks of course aren't bad at all.  It's a great stop off before going to a show in planet hollywood other nearby casinos."}
{"text":"We had lunch on the outdoor patio. What a great Vegas experience!  The atmosphere on the deck is casual and fun, and you just never know what you might see walk or drive by on the strip. The service was very good, both friendly and attentive. The fish tacos are excellent!"}
{"text":"We keep finding ourselves back here multiple times  when in Vegas. Love the patio bar literally right on the strip. People watching amazing and Bellagio Fountains within view across the street. 

The food is always good and the service attentive. Great ribs in addition to their Mexican entrees and surprisingly excellent breakfasts. The prices very competitive as well. 

The pitchers of decent Margs are a good deal and their salsa awesome. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Margaritas with Cabo Wabo tequila were awesome! Servers and bartenders were very nice and attentive. Food was typical Mexican fare,  good but not the best. Went back two more times for drinks, chips and salsa."}
{"text":"I have passed this place several times, amazed over the crowded terrace overlooking the strip right outside Planet Hollywood. This chain has made their name by offering mexican food along with strong margaritas.

This is good place to do Taco tuesday at or any other day in the week. Due to its location its ncie to just sit down and have a casual meal without any commitment. You can decide to either go here for a whole meal or just a drink before continuing to another waterhole in vegas. 

It can get pretty crowded so if you are a big company, you should probably be early. If you are just a few and feeling lucky, you can always try to sneak in later. In that case i would also suggest you grab one of the bar seats towards the strip. Here you can easily spend an hour or two crowd spotting without even reflecting about it.

This place is definitely worth a try due to its prime location, and you can either go for a quick drink or an unpretentious meal."}
{"text":"Sun afternoon/early evening - Shrimp ceviche, chicken wings, beers and regular margarita

The place has a nice deck overlooking the strip. The place was packed! They told us it would be an hour wait so we squeezed in by the outside bar & quickly grabbed some seats after a couple left. The bartenders were quick to take our order and bring us our drinks. The food and drinks were okay, definitely overpriced, but it's the location that you're really paying for. It located on Planet Hollywood's property.

My biggest complaint has to be the hidden CNF fee. When we received our bill I noticed the tax and another line that said CNF fee. I inquired about the CNF line and the bartender said she really didn't know what it was or why they charged it. She thinks it's a fee that Planet Hollywood imposes on them, so they pass it down to the consumers. I can't even remember what the percentage was, but the issue is that extra fees should be posted somewhere for everyone to see. I asked to see the menu again and it was not posted anywhere there. I asked them if this fee is posted anywhere and she said she didn't think so. You can't surprise consumers with extra fees on the bill!!! She did offer to bring a manager over to explain the fee to me, but I didn't feel like waiting. 

It's a 3 star place, minus 1 for hidden fees."}
{"text":"Really BAD service and bad attitude.  Lots of places to eat on the Strip, sorry I wasted any time with this one."}
{"text":"This place is awful... 
Lucky for the owner that it is on Las Vegas Blvd and looks happening and good... because otherwise they would have no customers. The food is overpriced, not good at all and the service is even worse (rude!!!!!!!).  I unfortunately ate here twice and my experience only got worse from the first time. Would never come here again! Save your money and eat at Taco Bell instead!"}
{"text":"First off, let me start by saying do not come here expecting gourmet Mexican food; this is not the place to get it(try Lindo Michoacan off the strip if you are looking to find that). That said, I've eaten at many Mexican restaurants and Cabo Wabo is still among my top 3 restaurants. My husband and I come here about once a month and order the nacho platter or something similar. It is always consistent and amazing. Great for a quick bite to a eat.

The servers and bar are a completely different story. Of all the times I've been here, I have never seen a server, hostess, or bartender more than once. Obviously, they go through new staff on a very regular basis for a reason. You will not normally have to wait for your food as those are brought out by the food runners, but water, napkins, or any kind of condiments, GOOD LUCK! I normally just get up and head to the bar to get them myself.

Now onto the frozen drinks. The servers will tell you completely outright the frozen drinks are premade and not strong at all, so don't be surprised when this is indeed true. They do not try to upsell them to you, and while I appreciate that, Cabo Wabo should be doing something to rectify this. If your own waiters even try to sway the customers from purchasing them, you're not going to make a good profit on these. Up the alcohol! Fat Tuesday's is just a few steps away, and for a lower price you can get the best frozen drink the strip has to offer.

All in all, I do like this place. Great food, but the staff has a lot to work on. Lots of room for improvement here! Get on it Cabo!"}
{"text":"Sammy Hagar rocks. As so do our bartenders Ashley and Darien and their suggestions. Never thought we would get seafood in the middle of the desert but it was amazing. And so were the drinks. The variety and uniqueness of the margaritas were impressive."}
{"text":"I'll give this place one star for the music, I would never eat or drink here again, ever. We went in for the 2 for 1 margaritas, which ended up being $11.00 each, even with the 2-fer!! Yeah, the server said they were regularly 22 bucks each. They came in small plastic cups for a nice touch, they weren't bad but the food was horrible. We ordered tons of starters and everything was bla, dry, even the nachos went back!  I went the safe route and got the street style tacos and I'll tell you any Taco Truck in California is 100 times better than that dry, bland, chopped up fajita meat thrown on some greasy corn tortillas and then topped with raw chopped onions and some cilantro, I ate half of one and gave the rest all back. Ew. Actually one of my friends said she probably wouldn't eat Mexican food for a while, that's how bad it was. 
Oh, and the cute bar girl poured tequila all over my face and  neck when I went up for the \"Mas Tequila\" shot at the bar. Seriously.."}
{"text":"This place is really nice. The only thing that's a disappointment is the price you have to pay for beers and the food. I would say, it's slightly over priced.

I got the fish ceviche, which was really good. It has mango in it, so it's not traditional ceviche but it was super tasty, nonetheless. 

I went there for the karaoke, which was super good. It doesn't last long so get there early, but the DJ is very nice and the sound system is phenomenal! 

Definitely going back to this place."}
{"text":"The 2 hostess' was very unorganized and couldn't keep track of the people in line and when to bring more people back. We watched 2 other couples go in front of us who came after us. When we asked about it they didn't remember we were even waiting. They weren't writing down names to keep track either. Once we finally got sat, it took 15 minutes for a waitress to even acknowledge us. We were ready to order our drinks and food by the time she got there. We got fish and steak tacos and they were ok, nothing special. Steak tacos were too spicy and the fish tacos were just bland. I've never been to a Mexican restaurant that you don't get tortilla chips brought to your table either, you had to pay extra for them. I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their time going here."}
{"text":"We went here last Sunday 4-21-13 the servers were rude. We wanted to sit outside they took our name and we to ask how much longer, we went up to see why it was so taking so long. they sat 6 other people behind us, we finally got a table and they made such a fuss we left, what the hell all we wanted was to eat. They get no stars if I could. We had 2 coors light and a chips and salsa 37.00 dollars. Rediculous. We had to explain to manager and waitress about 7 times."}
{"text":"So this place was ok.Maybe its better at night.I personally prefer diablos but even the last time I went there our bartender was a douch! The staff here is actually great our waitress outside still had a smile on her face when we wanted to move inside and the bartender inside was super nice and cute! She even made me exactly what I wanted, since I didn't like any of the drinks on the menu. Best of all I left my phone there and they somehow called my boyfriend and said they found it! So A+ for staffers and B- for food, overall that's a pretty good average I guess?"}
{"text":"The Cabo Wabo Cantina is another one of those tourist traps along the Strip...but then again, isn't Vegas one big tourist trap?  Come here if you're interested in some mediocre-to-average Mexican food and some good tequila cocktails - unless you have a strong aversion to very bad service and an unprofessional wait staff.  In my opinion: YMMV depending on your expectations and the mood of the waitperson.

Pros:
Party atmosphere
People watching
Strip location
Good tequila cocktails
Free shots for outgoing-types

Cons:
Quality of ingredients and taste of food
Wait staff
Wasted time (long wait for everything)

Let's start with the good: nice Strip location with a lot of foot traffic, which means you'll have plenty of people watching opportunities.  If you are the type to \"do anything\" and cut loose, then you might get a free shot, drink, or shirt - they have games or tequila lines throughout the day/night.  During dinner and throughout the evening, it does get pretty loud and party-like so be advised.  This place definitely isn't for families with kids, seniors, or those with limited mobility.

I went in with a party of 5 - 4 adults and 1 child.  The place is too loud for young children and the outdoor seating has you very close to the tables next to you - good luck trying to squeeze through with a stroller or going with somebody using a cane.  I spent about $100 (including tip) on just food - not bad for a casual bite on the Strip.  You get some decent sized portions for your money and the bartenders aren't shy about making stiff drinks, so it's not that bad if you can tolerate the wait staff and don't expect much from the food.

Our table ordered a few things, including: chicken fajitas, shrimp burrito, nachos, an order of tacos, and of course, drinks.  The food was ok, kind of bland and lacked any excitement despite the loud music blaring throughout the restaurant.  I thought the shrimp was actually good, both the way it was cooked and the marinade, which was a stark contrast to the rest of the items we ordered.  The food isn't up to par with Chevy's but the food is better than Diablo's Cantina; I think both places (Diablo's Cantina and Cabo Wabo) offer a party type atmosphere on the Strip with poor service.  

If you haven't guessed by now, I concur with the other reviews: Cabo Wabo has terrible service.  They have a young and unprofessional staff that couldn't care less about doing their job let alone paying any attention to the customer's needs.  Maybe they'll come by for more drink orders, maybe they'll come by to bring you the check, maybe they'll come back with your credit card - the whole experience makes you feel as if you're gambling.  Either the folks who work here have never eaten at a restaurant or they pick and choose their moments based on personal preferences/prejudices.  Management is obviously not looking for repeat customers - they are a one and done outfit.  

I think it is odd that most of the \"hip\" joints on the Strip have suspect service and less than average food tied to a decent atmosphere (because of the customers and nothing to do with the actual place).  When compared to similar outfits, the Cabo Wabo is \"ok\" in terms of food, but you really have to check your service expectations at the door.  This place would be a totally different experience with a competent crew, but as it is, I cannot recommend this place to anyone looking for a stress-free meal.  Unfortunately, the Cabo Wabo is completely YMMV based on the whims of your server."}
{"text":"Visited here on our first night in Las Vegas because it was thriving with people and looked right on to the strip! Best margarita I have ever had here! Definitely order it on the Rocks! Fish tacos were good but not the hottest, good portion size but not what you would usually expect! Friendly server too."}
{"text":"Beware of Mafia Charge!!!  The food was ok, but overpriced.  The service was awful. At the end we had an extra charge on our bill of $5.86
When we asked the waitress what this was, she laughed and said it was the mafia charge.  According to her all restaurants in the miracle mile shops charge this extra fee."}
{"text":"The $10 Cactus Pear Margarita was disgusting, it tasted like double-strength sugar syrup and sour mix.  Probably the WORST margarita I ever had.   I didn't try the other margaritas, but if this headache inducing sugar rush margarita made it onto the menu, then the others margarita are guaranteed to be over sweet premixed crap at best."}
{"text":"Only reason this place doesn't get one star is that the server was great at what she did and was really friendly. Otherwise, the food was not good. Five of us ate there and all five of us had upset stomachs later that evening. If you're a classic rock fan, it may be worth it for a drink, but food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Great view overlooking the Bellagio fountains if sitting outside. chips and salsa were good. Carnitas platter was decent but nothing special.  the beans were tasty but rice was not impressive at all.  Maybe the food would have tasted better or been more impressive if I was a drinker, but I am not. If your looking for good Mexican food on the strip this is not it.  Keep walking."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food. It is fun to sit outside and especially nice to hear great music on the patio and be able to see the fountains at Bellagio and people watch.  Loved the music and comedic talent of Shawn Eiferman.  Have followed this guy for a few years now and he is great and often has mega talented people playing with him too.  He is what living in Vegas is all about. Music and good food any night of the week.  His music is worth the trip to the strip!!"}
{"text":"Music way too loud, had to yell at my server and my friend sitting right next to me, but food was amazing. People watching is always fun too, sat in the outside patio overlooking bellagio fountains and lots of people walking on the street. Very high traffic spot. In the middle of all the action. Margaritas were watered down.. Overall not bad, but far from an intimate setting.  This atmosphere reminded me of a club."}
{"text":"Came to cabo wabo today and danny the chunky  server with  the gay tattoos did a awesome job!!!!! I asked make me the most authentic mexican Margarita you can make. And then  he brought me some shit that looked like it was made at 7-11 . But it was the best damn Margarita I ever had. And he kept them coming til I passed out in the  ph parking lot!! 


FANTASTIC SERVICE LOL !!"}
{"text":"They are getting one star just because you can't give them a negative 5.  I went there while visiting Vegas for a friends 21st birthday.  Sat outside had the NACHOS (in CAPS you will see why later) and some drinks.  The hostesses were absolutely horrible and rude but to top the entire experience off six of us got the worst case of food poisoning EVER!!!!  We were at urgent care the next day for IV fluids and sick for the rest of the trip could not go out of the hotel room.  Needless to say they ruined our trip and the meal turned out to cost us our entire trip and much more.  We will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Don't come here. Our service was terrible.  My drink came AFTER my food and both were ordered at the same time. My friends food (quesadilla) was only 2 tiny triangles. Food is over priced. Not worth a penny. Vegas is full of good food. Save yourself the experience and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Oh Cabo Wabo.  Stopped here for the drinks after breakfast so it wasn't very crowded.  Service was quick and everyone was friendly.  The fufu drinks were pretty strong and I'd definitely hit this place up again/"}
{"text":"So overpriced! I can't believe it, even for Las Vegas! 4 Cocktails and 4 Shots were $125... That's $16 per shot that barely had any alcohol in them due to being mixed with coconut milk and other. Server was inappropriate and slow. Never going back I'm afraid."}
{"text":"Pretty lousy service, and drinks are small and overpriced. We sat for a good 10 minutes before being acknowledged, we ordered a cocktail for my wife, chips and guacamole, and a Diet Coke for me. When the waiter brought the coco-rita my wife, he spilled part of the drink on the table, he left immediately with the drink tray for other tables, as the flow of my wife's spilled drink spilled off the edge of the table. We were left to scramble for napkins from empty tables to soak up the spill. Her drink started out mostly ice anyway, and she had just a few sips left before it was gone. Just a margarita glass 3/4 full of ice. The guac was ok, the salsa was a dark tomato pasty looking thing, not much flavor. Almost $40 for 1 drink, chips and guac, and a Diet Coke. What a lousy time."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!

What an AWFUL place!  The service was TERRIBLE, the food was way overpriced, and the experience was just average.  There are so many places better than this in Vegas that this should be your LAST choice.

To start, it took the waiter about 45 minutes to come over to our table, and that was after we had gone up to the host and asked for service after the first 20 minutes.  We ordered drinks and food at the same time, and we never saw him again until we tracked him down and demanded the check. 
   On top of all that, he got the orders terribly wrong, forcing us to send a dish back and wait another 15 minutes for it to be remade with the correct meat (I was given Carnitas and I am Jewish and don't eat pork).

The final insult was when I received my credit card bill and saw that I had been charged three times what my meal cost.  When I disputed the claim, the receipt I was sent had food on it that I did not order, and DID NOT HAVE MY SIGNATURE ON IT!!  IT WAS NOT MY BILL!!!  The waiter had given someone else a bill with my credit card number on it!!  They REFUSED to refund my money, even though I offered to pay for the food that I HAD ordered.


NEVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!"}
{"text":"What a great experience! We had a large party of 28 and the service was impeccable. The food was very tasty and extremely filling. The drinks were just right!!! Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice place with a great view on the Strip. The food is great as well! Our server was Jenna and she was super sweet!"}
{"text":"Over priced!  But then again it is the Las Vegas strip!! Cool atmosphere, typical food."}
{"text":"the machine at this place \"malfunctioned\" so our table got 10 margaritas for the price of one! so this place ain't gettin anything else from me lol"}
{"text":"Im not a big review type of guy.. But i must say coming into this gem of a spot was the best move i could've made today.. I went in to watch the warriors game and ended up barely watching it because of the phenomenal bar tending staff.. :please note: Kristy (bartender extraordinaire) is a fucking thug and made the night amazing. Some good food, good drinks, and better people made this otherwise normal night one to remember. FAJITASSSSSSS!!!! Wooooooo!!!"}
{"text":"Decent chips and salsa, but I go for the view. The rail seats are some of the best for people watching the tourists and seeing the Bellagio fountain."}
{"text":"Pretty bad. I went here around 9pm on a Wednesday, and it was pretty empty. The speakers were extremely loud for an almost-empty dining room...my group could barely talk to each other! The food was pretty bad too...the flour tortilla and beef of my taco were extremely dry...it was painful to eat. Cabo Wabo gets the two stars for service though--our waiter was attentive, and although the place was empty, the DJs put up a good front trying to recruit passersby for karaoke."}
{"text":"Ordered a taco made from the moon. IT was dry and filled with tons of cheese...where's the beef? I saw the beef like it was on a glory hole. Darn thing didn't even taste like meat. It was dry. I will never go to this place again. Expensive too..."}
{"text":"shrimp tacos were amazing.. service was good. will come back"}
{"text":"Just returned from Vegas and had a great time at Cabo Wabo Cantina. Service was excellent. Danny was a terrific server. The manager of the restaurant came by to say hello as well. The food was also very tasty! I would recommend this restaurant if you are in the mood for a casual atmosphere, good drinks and great food."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the margaritas were HORRIBLE! Way too sweet and didn't taste like it had any alcohol in it."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Food was brought to the table quickly, and was very tasty. Prices were very reasonable. There is a patio on the outside where one can sit and eat, in addition to the nice bar/dining area. It's also very easy to find, right at the front of Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"Better than a few years ago. Food was warm and well covered with toppings. Not fancy Mexican. Very simple. Would tell everyone to also stick with the basics and drink a couple of cervezas. It will help improve food quality. Location is nice to see folks walking by and bellagio fountains. Three stars because simple Americanized Mexican food."}
{"text":"Went in for chips and salsa and a few drinks. Nice place. Good friendly service."}
{"text":"Bad experience!  Wouldn't allow us to use our groupons. Purchased two of them. Had a group of 7. Manager was rude & could care less if we spent our money there. We walked out without ordering."}
{"text":"Everything was great from start to finish. They moved our reservation back when we were running late and even worked to seat us outside which is the way to go. Our waiter Paco gave great service and made good food recommendations. The drinks are strong just like everywhere else in Vegas, and the double Margaritas were huge. Our waiter actually bought a round of shots for us and the table of cute girls next to us, telling them it was from us. Food had big portions and was delicious. I recommend the queso dip and the ribs. Would go here again!"}
{"text":"One of the most unauthentic Mexican restaurants I've ever been too. The chips didn't taste like corn and the salsa lacked real flavor. 

Chicken wings were decent and the sauces came in the side. So don't expect to have your coated in whatever sauce you choose. 

Good for getting outta the sweltering LV weather and getting a break from walking."}
{"text":"2 only because guacamole was good. Service was okay, attentive at first, but no check-ins after food was served. 
Food was eatable, but not impressive by any means. Rice comparable to uncle bens, to paint a picture."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and have never really been disappointed. It does get crowded and service can be slow but we do not like to rush anyways. So far the Chicken Sabana is my favorite dish and will be hard not to order again. Friendly staff and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast menu! Our waitress Liz was awesome. Nothing like checking in and getting a free margarita at 9:00 AM."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for years and the waiters have always been awesome but today we met Danny and this guy knows how to provide great customer service.
Ask for him when you go !!!"}
{"text":"So much fun.  Celebrating my nephew, Mike, marrying Pat and decided to grab dinner here.  Sat at the outside seating area.  Loud, fun, loved watching the strip and all of the people.  Did I mention loud?  If you want to relax and chat....sit inside.
Food was great. I had the Cilantro Jalapeno Chicken.  Fabulous and has a kick!  Pat said Sammy's Tequila Shrimp is loaded with Tequila!  Burgers were big, basket of chips was huge.
Shawn Eiferman (www.shawneiferman.com) was playing that night.  He was great and made the night special for us.  Thank you SO much!!  He called the bridge and groom up for a dance and we really enjoyed ourselves.  Go on a night when he is there.  Got to listen to his CD on the road trip back to California.
Would definitely go here again!!"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday afternoon.  Sat on the outdoor patio with a fab view of the Bellagio fountain.  The Waboritas are fantastic.  Had chips and guac.  Decent size, but like everything in Vegas the price is a little steep.  Sammy Hagar showed up, worked through the crowd...totally cool.  They gave away a free shot.  Didn't need it after two Waboritas.  Would go back again on my next trip."}
{"text":"The service was pretty slow, but the waitress was nice about it. The food was decent and about as much as I expected."}
{"text":"So I really like this place...Went on a Saturday hmmm around 1pm and It was nice and hot out this place looked like so much fun...it was packed they had missters ...so we decided to have lunch there and we had a blast people watching staying cool with the mist and enjoying a nice lunch with cocconut margaritas on  a beautiful day...the server was nice and very helpful when asking questions about good drinks...so yea on our next vegas trip were def. going here again:)"}
{"text":"Service sucked! $13 for a margarita you serious... I would rather buy a bottle of Cabo wabo and chill at home. Service was horrible!"}
{"text":"Dirty table when we were sat down. Waitress did not know how to do her job. Boyfriend had a allergic reaction to the food and we asked for some ice cream, received the bill and was charged for both his food item and the ice cream. There are better places to enjoy in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance, live music, great view of the strip. And the best part are the servers. They are like the nicest people. We went on St. Patrick's day so got free margaritas. Good food, awesome drinks and lovely feel. A must go in las vegas"}
{"text":"Went here twice on our three day stay. Margaritas were good but I think they made me sick :( Food was awesome! Ordered the breakfast burrito with chorizo the first day and the breakfast nachos the second day. Our female server was awesome the first day and our second day male server sucked! Shouldn't have to ask for water three times to start the experience off!! Luck of the draw I guess?"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, right on the strip. Music was good. The gourmet Hamburgers are delicious. Killer Bloody Marys.  Little $$, didn't care for my server. .I never saw her,  she appeared very grumpy and sarcastic"}
{"text":"Prickly pear margarita was good. Chipotle shrimp was the best I have ever had in my life! Fajitas, quesadilla, and nachos were pretty tasty, especially when the extra chipotle sauce is added to it. The waiter was great, respectful, and fun. Wanted to go again before we left due to how happy I was with it all! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I agree, I really don't get all of the negative reviews.  It was exactly what I expected.  Not high end mexican (if that even exists), but good mexican food.  We had the Groupon and had no issues with it.  It seems everyone having an issue with it doesn't read the instructions on how to use it based on the number of people.  We had the Cadillac nachos for an appetizer and the waitress explained that they were individually portioned nachos.  So everyone complaining, maybe you should know what you are ordering.  They were great.  For entres we had the enchiladas and no complaints.  So if you are looking for a decent place on the strip, this place foots the bill."}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour at 4:15. No one took our order until 4:34, got food about 4:45, but they didn't bring the check until 5:20 and then it was full price. Feeling ripped off..."}
{"text":"Happy hour makes the prices fair. The quesadillas are the way to go (mark my words) skip the Cadillac nachos, you only get 8. 

That said, the drinks give this place a nice recovery. Order some margaritas, pass them around the table, the order a beer tower. Food tastes a lot better after a beer tower."}
{"text":"Beware! When ordering a pitcher of marguerites make sure they're not charging you for the \"upgrade\". Apparently our neighbors at the bar warned us and the same thing happened to me as well. Unbelievable! I'm normally a good tipper but I lost trust with this place."}
{"text":"Nice food drinks place. Lounge. Hang out. Wataver u wanna call it. Inside n outside area so my lil Wisdom was able to hang out w no issues. Ppl here are all pet friendly so made my experience much a happier ones! Ohhh. Danny M boy here w cute blk eyeglasses is awsum!!!"}
{"text":"Loud music. The atmosphere of the place wasn't for dinner or lunch for sure. The food was too spicy. Service was ok that's the only reason I gave one star."}
{"text":"This place kind of sucks. The waitress was super nice but the food is awful and the drinks are very overpriced. I'm happy we went because I was always curious about the place but we definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"The margarita was terrible. My wife and I were walking down the strip, and I decided to get a margarita here because the sign said they had \"killer margaritas\". Mine tasted like a melted lime popsicle with zero tequila in it. I threw it away, it cost me $12 but it was so bad I couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Went here at the last minute with the wife. We ordered chips and queso, carne Asada tacos, and fish tacos.

The service was excellent. We had a really attentive waiter who wasn't over bearing, but always made sure we had something to drink.

The chips and queso were okay. My wife and I enjoy spicy foods so the cheese dip was a little mild for us, but still tasty. Could just use some more peppers for our tastes.

The tacos were excellent. Both the fish and steak were cooked perfectly. The steak was spiced perfectly. The taco had avocado, onion, and cilantro on it. The fish taco had thinly sliced cabbage, fish, tomato and cream sauce on it. We did not eat the rice and beans. They were both bland and tasted like canned beans and instant rice. The tacos were filling enough so we didn't actually need them.

Plus use Yelp to check in and you get a free margarita which is a $10 value. Kinda nice!"}
{"text":"This wasn't the greatest place to get food at but it had your typical touristy fare that satisfies the majority. Good location right outside of PH to people watch and to see the fountains. They have misting machines at every table outside which is kind of a pain if you're a girl with frizzy hair(I am). The inside and outside was so extremely loud so talking to your friends that you're there with is next to impossible."}
{"text":"I really liked the location, our view from where we sat was great! Perfect view of the water show outside the Bellaggio. We also had a great view of all the people walking along the strip. Food was good but overpriced. We had the chicken tacos and carne asada tacos both were tasty but portion was very small, not worth $15 a plate, maybe $8, not $15. Beers were $7. Margaritas were around $15, wife ordered the Pear margarita and she said that it was just ok, wouldn't order it again. Overall paid $80 for 2 orders of tacos, 3 beers, and 1 margarita BUT we had a great view of the people. If you like people watching this is the place to hang out. I would go back just for that reason."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. The service is good. I would recommend eating on the deck because inside they play really really loud music."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a groupon for lunch here and it was fantastic. They had great music playing and the food was great. If you are expecting authentic Mexican food here you are an idiot. It is a tex-mex place and their fajitas are great. My only complaint was our waiter brought our food and bill, that is all. He didn't come by at all besides that."}
{"text":"The reason I give it five stars is the terrific customer service this place has.  I went there with an offer from groupon.  When I gave the waitress the groupon, she happily took it and didn't even groan (groupon customers know well to hide their groupon till the check comes),  I wish I wrote her name down, but regardless, she was fantastic.  My friend had the quesadilla and I had the tacos al pastor,... both were extremely filling, good, and were all we ate all day.  They weren't the BEST, but not bad.  Because we had great service, we give this 5 stars."}
{"text":"i loved this place so much, i went there for dinner on my first night and breakfast the following morning! the service is awesome and although the price is a little high, the portions are more than generous. i couldnt finish my food on either visits. the service is great, the whole staff was super friendly. really liked the overall ambiance inside and out."}
{"text":"Seated immediately in spite of a being super crowded and we were served quickly by a sweet waitress."}
{"text":"First time here.  Great margaritas!  Servers very friendly.  Had Sammy's Tequila Shrimp -- spicy and delicious.  GreenGo burrito good, too.  Highly recommend.  Reasonably priced for Vegas.  Ask for Ryan."}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food, our waitresses Amanda was kind and helpful.  Stopped on 2 separate occasions, both time food was terrific, not just the main dishes even the sides were delicious."}
{"text":"I was walking on the strip with my family and needed a bite to eat. We were kind of in the mood for some authentic Mexican food so we went to Cobo Wabo. When we sat down our orders taken right away so the services pretty good. Me and my wife both ordered the Carne Asada. When it came to the table it looked like dog food. We thought it was just something they marinated it in. So we gave it a try but it was terrible it taste like dog food to. The management was nice but the food was terrible. And it wasn't just the state that was bad the chicken tenders for my kids were bad and my mother-in-law ordered pork. And it was disgusting. If you're looking for authentic dog food this is the place if you're looking for authentic Mexican food Look elsewhere. Don't eat here unless it's an emergency."}
{"text":"The Busker Kings entertainment was fabulous.  The food was great.  Service was great.  I will return."}
{"text":"Visit Sept 20 9:00 PM. Yet another vote for the Most Douchy bar on the LV strip!
Ignored at the bar for twenty minutes... Beer selection less than acceptable (by Boston standards).
Bailed and went a short distance to Burgr, much better in all regards. 

Dont bother with Cabo Wabo! One and a half thumbs down."}
{"text":"Excellent magi mahi and shrimp tacos! We sat outside in 100 degree weather but it was the best experience weather as their outside patio has misters! And with a great cold margarita, and having a perfect view of the Bellagio's fountain show, couldn't ask for a better experience!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!!! The food is so delicious that
Even when you're full you want to keep eating! The food was cooked perfectly, they accommodated me! I got very sick from the water at MY HOTEL & I told them can i please bring in a bottle of soda. & they were like of course we understand. If you got here you will not be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Food and service were horrible. The restaurant wasn't busy, but it took our waitress 10 minutes to even greet us, another 15 minutes for drinks to arrive and 30 minutes for food. Bloody Marys were pretty good, but that's the best I can say."}
{"text":"Just returned from Vegas and this place helped make our night (6/21/13) on the strip a blast!  We were celebrating 10 years married with our wedding party and Danny the server was awesome!  I actually contemplated even going as I read some the reviews but must tell you, it was awesome.  The casual atmosphere, the drinks and food were excellent.  Dara, the manager, came over to assure we were taken care of.  This place helped our group of people continue to have a great night!  Thanks Danny and Dara!."}
{"text":"I just love this place. We tried Nachos Platter, Burrito Bowl and Tortilla Soup, everything was great in taste and looks.  If you looking for cool place to hang out on Strip with good old rock music, this is it."}
{"text":"Feekin best - nicest - most educated waitress ever !!! I would wait 2 hours for her table ... Has a new daughter - and needs to insure her college education has a sound base -- don't be a cheap sob . This kid had moxie and is sweet x"}
{"text":"They took over the old Trader Vic's spot at Miracle Mile.  3 stars because it's the perfect location on the strip to people watch and catch the Bellagio water show and their drinks are good but the food is MEH and overpriced.    

That said, would only come back to order drinks and sit on the patio.  If you want better Mexican eats, hit up La Salsa Cantina inside the mall or on the strip next to the M&M shop."}
{"text":"This past week we came here twice, once for dinner - and the second time was for late night tequila shots. For dinner, we were able to get a spot on the patio, overlooking the strip - great spot to people watch! Beers were overpriced, and undersized (so were the margaritas).. but the food is good. Order the fajitas, which can be split between two people (around $20) and you both will be full. There is karoake inside too until late night, so end the night perhaps with tequila and singing?"}
{"text":"Came in here for a pre Britany Spears dinner. Unfortunately we kinda got forgotten after being seated. What brought up the stars was Try'esha. She was just passing by not even supposed to be assigned to our table. She was great made awesome recommendations. My baja fish tacos tasted great. And it was the perfect amount. Thanks Try'esha for saving the night."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I wanted to stop for some lunch on the strip during our early afternoon walk and this place caught our eye.  Bottom line: HUGE disappointment!  Here's what we ordered: 
Fundido de quest con chorizo: it did not taste good at all.  You couldn't really taste the chorizo despite seeing it in there.  It tasted like curdled/cheap cheese. 
Carne asada tacos: I took 2 bites and gave up.  The saltiest carne asada and it tasted like someone scraped it off the pans from last night. 
2xTortilla Soup: the chicken was dry.  It was more of a thicker broth.  
The waiter was great and he took the carne asada off the bill.  
Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"This was really nice Mexican. 

The staff could have shown a bit more enthusiasm; and their attentiveness was so so. 

Meanwhile, the food was good, and it came out at a reasonable speed. They refilled the corn chips and dip, and that was delicious. We had the nacho platter to share as well, and it did not disappoint. The guac was amazing!

I had the cotija cheese crusted quesadilla, the appetiser, as a main, and thought it was enough after consuming a bit of the corn chips. 

One friend had the tortilla soup, and said it was packed with flavour!

The other friend has sammy's tequila shrimp. She was really happy with them. She said they were tasted fantastic, and was plenty food. 

Overall, not a bad place for really good food!"}
{"text":"this was actually really good....some of the best food I had in Vegas this entire trip. It was a tad pricey for alcohol, $11 for sangria (although, it was a pint)....and $15 for a salad with no meat (I assumed they would knock a couple bucks off for not wanting the meat). So the entire thing with tax and tip was $34. So i was a tad shocked.

But...the service was fantastic. Super nice and helpful. And the salad was amazing. Tortialla shells on the bottom, with guacamole, lettuce, onion, tomato, avocado and beans.  Delish. Definitely could have used more beans, however. 

Overall it was a good experience, but like everything in Vegas...a tad pricey."}
{"text":"The Margarita with Grand Marnier was to die for, and the service was great. But don't count on good food. Chips and salsa (not free) were subpar and the tacos were flavorless. The pinto beans were acceptable at best. Don't waste your money here---this place needs to revamp its menu."}
{"text":"Wait staff apathetic, food ok nothing awesome or original. Less than 2 ounces chicken in dinner sized salad with chicken addd"}
{"text":"I just returned from a 3 night stay in Las Vegas. On our first night we wanted to go somewhere fun that was close (We stayed at the Elara Hilton). We were directed to Cabo Wabo. We ended up ordering nachos. We gave them crazy requests to make my teenage daughters and me happy. We ended up with beans and jalape√±os on the side with chicken on half. They were happy to do this for us. They even brought out more chips and condiments for a low price for us. We went back for the same thing on our last night. And the price was relatively good. A big thumbs us from us."}
{"text":"Had the carne asada nachos 4 dollars more for carne and it had very little of it. Not recommended to pay 18.95 for it. Good server though."}
{"text":"I have to give it 5 stars, even though the drinks are grossly overpriced.  The food is just amazing.  Cheese dip, fantastic.  Chicken quesadillas, best I've ever had.  The fried rice is outstanding.  My husband always gets the sirloin fajitas and they actually cook them medium unlike most places who cook them well.  Love the food.  Service has always been great as well.  They do have a really good happy hour with food/drinks though."}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary, the drinks are great , but I ordered the shrimp and I got food poisoning ......not a good way to spend my anny. It is loud inside, service is slow and it is pricing for the food."}
{"text":"I stopped here for breakfast while I was In Las Vegas. I had the Machaca omelet it comes with shredded Mexican beef chorizo peppers and onions Oaxacan cheese sour cream and pico de gallo. It was absolutely delicious and filled me up nicely. A couple of people were sitting on either side of me and they commented on how good it both looked and smelled and one of them ordered it. 
The service was good my bartender was really nice although I can't remember her name unfortunately. 
I definitely recommend going here."}
{"text":"Had this place for lunch yesterday and to be honest it wasn't much to write home about. Service wasn't bad but the waiter kept messing up our order and then tried to charge us an extra  $50 on our ticket. Would I come back here again, nope. The food was average and tasted more like Chili's and was too pricey for the quality of food even by Las Vegas standards. I honestly wouldn't even recommend this place as a top 50 choice of restaurants in Las Vegas. And their margaritas were not even very strong, they weren't nasty but again they are Chili's quality. In my opinion I'd pass on this place unless everywhere else was packed."}
{"text":"The food here is decent considering it's on the Strip.  That's about the best I can say. The drinks however were disappointing.  I tried several different mixed drinks and they were never quite right.  On top of that, expensive for what you get.

Good view from the balcony though."}
{"text":"I usually give companys a break but i truly think this company needs great improvement,  the service as far as how long it took to get a burger was very poor it took 25 to 35 minutes  after the initial 15 minutes it took just to get our server to the table to receive our food the food was ok but not really very good, my friends said they had Mexican food and it was definitely better it hot on the patio no misters ."}
{"text":"The waitress was a real b*tch, really rude I'm surprised she still works there. Never going back."}
{"text":"We went to this place only for appetizers before the show. We were able to be immediately seated since we chose to sit inside. The waitress seemed very knowledgeable and very attentive. 

The salsa was overly salty but was balanced by the bland chips. I was impressed by the nachos they were very tasty and I enjoyed the guacomole, don't using like it.  I would attend again if I return to Vegas."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick drink inside the Miracle mall while waiting for the Marc Savard comedy show.  We sat down, spoke to the bartender for a bit, and ordered Waboritas, very good btw.

However, yet another camera lady came and took a picture of us.  When I told her I did not want to buy the picture, she stormed away with a pretty bad attitude....

Dear Cabo Wabo / Planet Hollywood, please do not allow rude photographers ruin the experience of your guests.  

Cheers"}
{"text":"Extremely satisfied by my service by Jason. He did a fantastic job making sure we felt welcome and appreciated as guests which is hard to find in Vegas. Also the guacamole was really yummy."}
{"text":"We stopped in here before a show and were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. My wife and friend had the lime cilantro chicken breast. The portion was large and the accompanying vegetables were fresh and delicious. The berry mojito and Sammy's Red beer were both good. Service was pretty good. The calamari appetizer was tasty, but a little too greasy. The fish tacos (3) were large and tasty."}
{"text":"I have been here twice on two separate Vegas trips. So service is what ever but the food is darn good! Ceviche is okay. The best is the chicken quesadilla, it has crispy cheese on the outside it's so amazing! Appetizer is too small. Nachos are also great! Lots of cheese!!! Can't wait to have it all again"}
{"text":"Best Place Ever!!! The food was so good.  It was like there was a Party in my mouth!!!! And the drinks were good!!! Excellent service.."}
{"text":"Super fast service and our waitress was fun and perky.  The food was tasty, but nothing to write home about.  I'd for sure go back as the atmosphere was fun and exciting, definitely a great way to start of the Vegas vacation!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty. Me whole table thought their meals were good. Nothing to get excited as far as food goes. The atmosphere is the best part of this place. We ate out on the patio. Very fun, loud place. Everyone seems to be having fun. Not a place to come if you want to hold conversations. But very fun for drinking and people watching. Service was ok. We got our food pretty quick but our server never came back to get us more drinks or see if our food was ok. But, in her defense it was very busy at that time. Probly wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but glad I finally got here"}
{"text":"Laura provided excellent service.  What an awesome employee for this business.  She was attentive, friendly, upsold me a drink, and invited us back for breakfast.  Impressive."}
{"text":"$3 for chips and salsa - ridiculous! This comes free at a majority of Mexican establishments. 
Overall dinner was sub par, and coupled with loud Hip Hop music, the total effect was v dissapointing."}
{"text":"Aia out beautiful waitress just made our day so much brighter getting my grandmother a shot for Mother's Day and treating us so kindly. 
Thank you Aia (1044) saw that # on the ticket :-) hope it's the right girl"}
{"text":"When there on Sunday nite with my wife to have late dinner. I have been here before food is ok service was good but this time service was terrible , we sat there for 20 min no one showed up I got up and asked one of the girls in front for help and that didn't help, finally a waiter showed up to say hello and left as fast as he showed up. I say if they were busy Ok but they weren't. That's the last time I'm going to go there and would not recommended anybody to go there."}
{"text":"I feel like two stars is generous but one star is because my friend and I still had a good time and the other star is because we got the Cadillac Nachos for free with the Miracle Mile coupon book. This place was cute and fun but the food was terrible and the service was slow and nonexistent. Our food was cold, my friend got the wrong drink, and her order was messed up three times (even after sending it back). We won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"I was there Sat for lunch. The food was NO bueno!  my friend had a Bloody Mary, she said it wasnt that good.

I had an enchilada and a taco de carnitas........I might as well have just gone to Taco Bell and saved the money. 

The service was not the best either........... I had to ask one chick/hostess who clearly heard me the first time ....... where the restroom was at.

I would never go back to this place.

Yes, the outside seating patio is nice but thats about it for this place."}
{"text":"Soooooooooo disappointed!!!! It's like being at a cattle drive and you're the cattle.... The food was decent, atmosphere was ok but, the service is absolutely atrocious!! They seat you and tell you to be patient because they just over seated that section. Ok, I'm patient, I'm in the business... I'm not that patient!! We waited and waited and waited, finally drinks and our order taken. Then we waited and waited and waited. Food comes, I wait and wait and wait for salsa. Ask for desert menu, wait and wait and wait. I'm sure you get it by now. They need  a new cattle hand to whip this place into shape..."}
{"text":"Loved their chips and salsa. So kudos LOTS for the best chips on the strip. Service is excellent and our server was awesome. I ordered the carnitas platter, its served with rice, beans, guacamole and hot flour tortillas. Their meat was a little dry but overall it was really flavorful- I added the salsa served with their chips and it gave the carnitas quite a bit of a pop. Would definitely keep coming to this place!"}
{"text":"What I imagine to be the worst place to watch the UFC on the strip. We arrived late thanks to a plan delay which should have allowed the staff plenty of time to take care of EVERYONE before as we were the last table to arrive for the reserved seating area. We stepped into the elevator and expressed our frustration with the delay and how much we were ready to eat and drink. Still so much time went past before a waitstaff approached our table  that my husband had to go bar. They didn't have my drink available on the 2nd floor despite it being on the menu so the bartender said he would go downstairs....nope, never happened. Again we waited. We finally got my drink from another staff member and order food...not terrible. The icing on the cake....everyone left their tables and we still didn't receive a bill...we waited til it was completely empty of patrons, still nothing. Time to go in my opinion. Of course they had our card on file from our reservation so of course they got their money, too bad we didn't get what we paid for. Don't go there. Don't be disappointed. Lame place."}
{"text":"Salsa and Chips are HUGE....Great location, great waiter and seating staff and very good food.  I am not Mexican but I eat Mexican food almost every week.  The food was very good, cost effective, and the location is right in the middle of everything. Stop here and get a drink and an appetizer.  We did this the night before I left but we should have went here sooner......"}
{"text":"Food was amazing but carefull they force you to tip them. The server told us the tip is required and we HAVE to pay it and according to her, her manager told her it's mandatory even when the receipt shows it's suggested. Horrible rip off. I will never go there again. We were going to tip her but she told us $30 is additional tip required. Never again"}
{"text":"Only had the happy hour tequila and a carne asana street taco! Both were yummy total 9 bucks!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Decent service, AMAZING drinks, and great location. Can view bellagio fountain show while on patio, and the food is AMAZING. the Sopas con Carne is the best food i've ever eaten. Their fajitas are pretty amazing as well, and their abondigas soup is perfection. Don't forget to try the dreamsicle! it's amazing"}
{"text":"Good food, large portion!  Not a big fan of the salsa. Great view & people watching if you sit outside."}
{"text":"Always a great place to hang out and people watch ... grab a seat on the rail overlooking Las Vegas Blvd and drink the afternoon away. Great margaritas, solid chips and salsa, decent entrees ... the chicken sabana with beans and chorizo is excellent!"}
{"text":"Excellent Service and good food! We enjoy coming here and will always return. Our waiter,  Jason is really nice and professional. The manager, Summer is awesome as well!  If you want to have an enjoyable experience,  come hang out at Cano Wabo!!"}
{"text":"This place was very busy on a Saturday afternoon. The service was pretty slow. However, the salsa was great! We ordered a pitcher of Margaritas for the three of us. It went for about 4 Margaritas total. Food was good. I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great views of the strip. We did the yelp check-in deal and got ourselves a delicious (strong) margarita. I enjoyed dinner and would definitely look forward to going again, especially with the reasonable prices and good chips/salsa."}
{"text":"I harshed this place in my last review of it, deservedly in my opinion. 

I gave Cabo Wabo another chance on a recent trip.  My buddy and I wanted to chill and have a couple drinks, so we gave it another try for drinks and appetizers. 

We asked to sit on the outdoor deck overlooking the strip, and it was all good this time.  Our server was very attentive and fun.  The margaritas were good.  The chips and salsa were good.  The \"Mexiyaki\" chicken wings were great.  We had a great time and ended up having \"more than couple\" margaritas along the way.   

Pricing seemed fine for drinks and appetizers in Vegas.  I think the tab with tax for chips and salsa, chicken wings, and about 8 margaritas was about $100.00  

All in all, I'd say Cabo Wabo is great for drinks and appetizers if you want casual and if you want to sit outside.  They have indoor seating, but I can't speak to that.  For me at least, one the main draws is the outdoor deck overlooking the strip."}
{"text":"I've been to cabo Wabo a couple of times, sat outside and it was great.  Had the fajitas and a margarita and both were very tasty.  They had a great band for entertainment and it was a lot of fun.  Definitely will go back again and again."}
{"text":"Cocorita! Coconut margaritas are yummy. We ordered chicken enchiladas, lobster enchiladas, shrimp ceviche, steak burrito, and steak fajitas. They were all delicious. Everyone enjoyed their meals. Pricing $16 - $22 each, which is normal for most LV strip restaurants. The lobster was very sweet."}
{"text":"Blah. It was okay. I think if they lowered all of the prices by five dollars and added a couple of waitresses, I would have had an A+ experience. It was a huge tourist trap. Would probably not go back."}
{"text":"Seeing as how I was staying at PH it was only right I came here. Granted I didn't dine here, but I sure did use the walk up bar to get some yummy drinks. I got a mix, of what I really dont remember because I drank so much out there, lol, but it was strawberry and reg margaritas i think mixed in the tall 12 dollar glass. With an extra shot of course. Yes. I know. 12 bucks. for a drink. + a few more bucks for a shot. How stupid, right? Wrong. I'm an out of towner, typical tourist, taking in the sights and Cabo Wabo was actually one of my fav places to drink on the strip. Prob because of the convenience of coming downstairs in the middle of the night getting an alcoholic beverage. Either way, by the time my week long vegas trip was over I brought home about a good 4 Cabo Wabo cups. Looking forward to doing it all over again when I come back in October. I'll give a better review then since my Vegas cherry has been popped."}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe and a great place to come if you're looking for some good eats on the strip. A great, relaxed place for a group. The beef short rib burrito is baaamb. Drinks are good too. You really can't go wrong, the price is eh but all in all a good place whilst on vacation or need a quick place to eat."}
{"text":"Service was very slow! We had to wait about an hour til we get our food. We didnt order appetizers because we thought our orders were simple enough. I ordered fish and chips (it's on the specialties list) and the fish was overcooked. 
Hubs ordered fish tacos. 

Host was lovely. Waitress not so much. If you are hungry or pressed for time, do not come here!!"}
{"text":"good food and they were really busy it took a lot longer for drinks and food to get there but over all the place is good"}
{"text":"OK so the drinks were good... Strong and tasty, a bit pricey, and the waitress was friendly. Why two stars? Because we were going by we saw a sign they'd be showing the fights and decided to stop there for dinner and drinks. We asked about the fights and they said $30/person to go inside upstairs and watch or watch at the bar for free. Well, we said we'd sit at the bar. After inquiring twice about when they'd be showing the fights we were informed that they actually weren't showing the fights at the bar and welcomed us to open our wallet to go upstairs. Felt totally conned. We cancelled our order, got to go cups and left with our drinks. Do not appreciate being lied to."}
{"text":"Good food, live music, good margaritas. Got the chicken Quesadillas and my friend had the fajitas. Both were delicious and the rice and beans were good as well. No free chips and salsa like many Mexican places but I guess that's expected along the strip."}
{"text":"Best drinks on the strip in my opinion. Prices are reasonable and it has a fun atmosphere looking over the strip"}
{"text":"Bomb chips and salsa.

Great seating outside - something rare in Vegas. 

Large glasses of water and soda - also a bonus. Service was great.

Prices were high, portions small. Tacos were like BABY tacos. But again, it's Vegas, so prepared to get ripped off."}
{"text":"This place rocks!! Ryan was our waiter & he is awesome! Super nice & fun. This place is amazing. We sat immediately & put food was here so fast it was crazy. It was soooo good. I had the salad & the lettuce was shredded so fine that it was seriously the easiest salad to eat... I know that sounds weird but if you eat salad a lot you know what I mean. 

Anyway, awesome place & food rocks & chips are made right here & super hot :)
Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great service.  Went there on 01/18/2016 for my birthday.  We were out looking for food and decided to see if Cabo Wabo had any.  They do. It's was great and the waiter certainly is an asset to the company.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"At first I didn't like the place nor how the menu looked but once the food came I was  blown away by taste"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was welcoming, as we were visiting from Out of town. The waiter seemed annoyed, and the first impression was the salsa wasn't good AT ALL. Being a Mexican restaurant and not having good salsa, is huge!! Ordered a quesadilla, and had to send it back because it had no flavor, or taste. Enjoyed the live music though...."}
{"text":"Horrible margaritas. Cabo Wabo is not a good tequila, IMHO.

Service was OK, food was below average for a Mexican chain. I won't return."}
{"text":"we were wanting mexican and decided this based on location. food was ok: margaritas- pretty good, not very strong; chips were very thick, salsa was spicy and fresh; beef fajitas- beef was charred like it like it (though they didnt ask how we would like our steak cooked); tortillas were not homemade- looked like they were right out of a plastic package and werent even warm. if a restaurant uses premade tortillas, warming them would be a good idea. service, however, was very good. we really didnt have any expectations of the place, so there was little room to be disappointed. we were seated on the patio and had a great view of the bellagio fountains, and there were misters all over the patio, which was a nice respite from the heat. overall, it was ok, and we woiuld go again, if only to have a drink and watch the fountain show!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Located in LV so you could imagine how busy it must be. Regardless of the amount of people that decided to eat there at the same time we did, which was a lot, the service couldn't have been any better/faster! Our server was attentive at all times and super upbeat! 

The food was very tasteful and so were the drinks. I got the carne asada torta and a house margarita. I definitely recommend both! The torta was delicious and so filling that I was only able to eat half of it. I put half of the blame on the fries, which were also super good. 

Prices were pretty reasonable, specially compared to nearby spots taking into consideration that it's a tourist area.  All in all, definitely five star worthy!"}
{"text":"This place is good for two things:

1. Margarita headaches
2. People watching (exceptionally good for this)

Ok, this is Vegas; but this place was pretty terrible as far as the food went. I don't think thats why anyone would go here... but still. Skip it.

The margaritas are, meh... sugary and headache-making.

Anyway, good location, you can see the Bellagio water show go off every half-hour, but aside from that and watching all the weirdoes walk by, no redeeming qualities. Save yourself the $50.

There was a Michael Jackson impersonator just standing on the sidewalk and not dancing though...

Skip it"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a margarita and nibble before our show.  The queso fondue was tasty.  Great patio for people watching on the strip."}
{"text":"If i could rate Cabo Wabo a negative score I would. 

We arrive just in time for Karaoke, which I would give 5 Stars.  But that's where the good ends. 

We were not actually sat by the hostess just pointed toward the tables. No menus, so I'm assuming the frat boy waiter assumed we didn't want service. When I asked for menus he looked at me like I was nuts. Then 5 seconds after getting the menus he asked us, \"so are you gonna order something?\" Really?

He never asked us if wanted drinks, I went up to the Bar to get mine. For a weak 8 oz margarita it was TWENTY DOLLARS!!!! For a pre-made Slurpee with house alcohol!!   

I would never go back there again. They treated us like trash and we did nothing to deserve it. 

And to top it off I accidentally left an expensive souvenir behind, when I returned they didn't have a lost n found they said \"we just throw it away\". I tried to express the whole experience to the manager, his response was \"oh well\". 

WOW - worst service EVER!"}
{"text":"We only got drinks but the Vegas crush and the three way too notch! Perfect for a sunny day just walking on the strip!"}
{"text":"I really didn't want to like this place.  I guess it was an anti white-guy-owning-tequila-company thing.  BUT it's pretty good and good on him I guess. Wife and I stopped in to get a quick bite/drink before seeing a show. We shared the queso dip and chips, dos ceviches, and mexican tossed salad. Queso dip - ok. Dos ceviches - amazing. Some shrimp ceviche and some chipotle tuna tartar. It was REALLY good. Like enough to tell people about and \"go back for\" good. The salad - surprisingly good. Very simply dressed, cilantro and corn included. Very good. Overall, pretty good. Even better if you can get a seat out on the patio for some people watching."}
{"text":"My friend & I came here for our anniversary on 9/23/17. We asked for Chips and Salsa as appetizer. That was good! We also asked for a Pitcher of Margarita (Verde, Cilantro, Cucumber) once brought out our glasses were warm, no salt on rim and no lime wedge to emphasize the drink looks. Out pitcher has TONS of ice more than half the pitcher was ice. The it was tasty but  we had trouble tasting the tequila! Price $47+TAX. Our entrees were Pulled Pork Platter: Excess fat on meat, little meat, NO pico de Gallo, No corn tortillas only flour, Beans were runny and no black beans. She order Nachos (no meat she is vegetarian) She found some meat in her nachos and she was gross out and didn't eat. We asked for limes and took about 7 minutes to bring 3 wedges. We asked for the bill and came out to be $99.00 with a $20 cash tip. We had a terrible time here. We enjoyed our company but the food, drinks and customer service was very disappointing. We didn't enjoy our lunch at all so we paid and left. I hope management reached out to me and we can discuss more about this matter. I don't recommend this spot to anyone celebrating their anniversary or a special day. Its bad service and overpriced. Not worth what you pay. I don't recommend Cabo Wabo to anyone out there. How can we had enjoyed our lunch there? No way! We don't seek perfection but we do seek good hospitality."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have gone to this place in the whole country, so I had a blast here. Even though, I didn't order food, we got DRINKS quite a few of them. We were group of 6 guys, everyone else got food and they could hardly finish their meals. The service here was FANTASTIC, super friendly staff. 

So, it was one of my friend's b'day, so I asked the server if we could get him a piece of cake/ dessert on the house . He said NO!    *At this point, I am like shitt*

The very next second, he says, I can do TEQUILA shots. I was thinking maybe it's for him only, but server got it for entire table.

Tip: You can get a house margherita if you do a YELP Check-IN."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on our first night in town. It was the only place I could sway the whole group to go into - we got a bucket of beers and stood out on the uncomfortably packed deck for no reason. We should have moved on. The live music was not that great, and I was in no mood for the crowd. I'll probably avoid this place next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Aia was the best! Came two days in a row for the amazing nachos and the wonderful service. Always a must when in VEGAS! Thank you aia for being so friendly and sweet to my baby girl. We Will always be back!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 6. We went there for dinner . We ordered a few appetizers and drinks. 
The food included a platter of appetizers and one nachos (cheese with peppers etc - it was a vegetarian dish) .  Honestly we wanted to order main course after but we were super full. 
It is a decent restaurant , prices are okay. Not that high. 
But the drinks were bad. We ordered shots , of course tequila shots. Everyone had 2 shots but there was no feel . It felt like it was diluted. Sorry but that is exactly what we felt. 
Then ordered margarita. And it was also like 5.5/10.
I was expecting more :( 
Sorry about that."}
{"text":"I like Cabo Wabo because they serve a complete collection of tequilas. The downside is that the place is so expensive ($15 for a margarita)... and chips and salsa was not complementary.Guess the location is responsible for a portion of the fees?"}
{"text":"This is such a fun establishment! My husband and I sat outside and were entertained the entire time just by people watching and the fun music. The food is delicious! We were able to sit immediately which was super convenient! We'll be back once in Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Fun place!  Hostess attitude is a problem as usual...they really have no power but think they do...lol
 Excellent selection of Tequila...prob best in Vegas!
Outside patio is on strip!!!  Inside very nice but tables a little close..   Cleaner than original in Cabo!
Sammy plays here on occasion."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican food in Vegas. Everything is fresh and delicious. The place is always packed, but the service is always top notch. We try to visit Cabo Wabo everytime we go to Vegas. Great queso, quacamole. I try to order combo plates so I can try all kinds of dishes. I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"My friend and I rolled into LV late and were looking for a lively place to grab some food and drinks. I had high hopes for Cabo Wabo after several good experiences at Margaritaville. Thought this place would have a similar vibe and offer quality food. Not quite....I'll be heading to Margaritaville in the future. 

We sat on the patio...misters were nice in the 100+ temps. Waitress was nice...raucous, horrible sound from the karaoke bar was not so nice. 

The fish tacos were bland , runny and the tortillas were on the brink of expiration. They just had zero flavor. My friend said her tacos were so-so. Didn't bother ordering drinks for I knew it was going to be a quick dinner. 

I would have been better off at Del Taco (at least I would have pocketed some money to take to Sephora to buy some makeup or thrown the $50 in the slot machines). 

Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Oddly enough, I'd never been to a Cabo Wabo before just recently. I honestly don't know why, because the food was delicious and the atmosphere was lively.

The wait staff was extremely helpful and exuberant. Our waitress was attentive and kind, even when we had to wait on a late member of our party. She continually checked if we needed anything and gave us great recommendations for the food. We were really pleased with the service, especially since it was a packed restaurant on the Vegas strip.

I ordered the \"Three Way\" (I know, it sounds terrible) as my beverage of choice. It was one of those icy, mixed cocktails from the slurpee-looking machines in the front of the establishment. And let me tell you, it was far from terrible. In fact, if the alcohol didn't pack such a punch, I might have ordered two. The drink is a mixture of raspberry, blueberry, and blackberry flavoring. It was light, fruity, and very refreshing on a Vegas summer night. 

For my meal, I ordered the Chicken Enchilada Combo, which includes rice and beans. And if you just look at the picture I've supplied, you can already tell that it was amazing. I loved the verde sauce on top of the enchiladas themselves. The chicken was succulent and full of flavor. The rice had a good amount of spice and the beans were fresh. The cheese was also yummy; thoroughly melted and mixed. 

We also had several servings of chips and salsa before our meal. The fact that we kept asking for another heaping has more to do with the fact that the chips and salsa were both crisp and fresh, rather than because we were starving. 

Finally, the food is heavy. In other words, be prepared to pack a to-go box. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Cabo Wabo. And I look forward to my next visit.

Happy feasting!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here. It has a great location, mid strip right outside Planet Hollywood. I had the shredded beef tacos & the sangarita. The drink was awesome, a mix of a sangria & a margarita. I got it in the big souvenir cup, which is a large glass cup with cabo wabo Las Vegas on it. The tacos were also really good. 2 large tacos in a crispy she'll with plenty of juicy meat & fresh toppings. I got extra salsa, I suggest doing that because it doesn't come with much on it. The service was really good & fast. They were very polite & new the menu very well. I would come back here."}
{"text":"Excellent service, good food and outdoor seating where you can watch the bellagio fountains.  Band was excellent too!"}
{"text":"Cabo wabo deserves more stars! The patio is such a fun place to people watch and sip on margaritas! The food and service was really great too and a decent price for Las Vegas. The chefs lobster burrito special was on point and you can't go wrong with the fajitas! Also they have killer margaritas. The seating for the patio can get a bit crowded. But overall, I'd recommend grabbing a bite here if you're craving some tex-mex and checking out Bellagio fountains while you're in the area."}
{"text":"Horrible Horrible place. The service is ridiculous! The host was the extremely rude and made it seem as we were bothering her with our presence.  It seemed as if they didnt want you to come in so she can text on her phone and chat amoungst themselves.  For the great service is Las Vegas im sure this place can do better then need to re hire a whole new staff and start fresh.  Even the security guard was disrespectful! When I tried to walk by him to squeeze through he wouldent move and inch after asking.  Overall this place stinks and you can choose a way better place. DONT GO TO CABO WABO!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is okay if you're hungry. But it's kind of pricey considering what you're getting. I'm guessing the cost is attributed to the location."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere sitting along the strip. Reasonable prices on most things. They prepared the portabello fajitas for me vegan and gluten free. It was pretty oily though! The strawberry lemonade is delicious and if you buy a glass they refill it for free...forever! The waiter was super friendly and helpful and really on top of things. We had a lot of fun here. More vegan and gluten free options would be awesome."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try \"Cabo Wabo Cantina\" on one of our nights out while in Vegas. We were highly disappointed. When we arrived I got a great glimpse at the hostess breasts. I am about to eat, WITH my husband now that is just disgusting! She was wearing half of a WHITE tank top, I could see her boobs completely except fro her nipple truly. It was just extremely unpleasant to begin with, at that moment we should have left, but we did not. A male hostess sat us, ignored me the whole time walked to the stable but had a full conversation with my husband, OK. We sat down, our waiter came by 5 minutes later, we asked for water and my husband ordered a Toasted Colada ($14), he said was ok. 75% ice. We also ordered our food, my husband got some Ceviche appetizer and I got Hot & Spicy Wings which I did not know came with a side of potato. The food was good, the service sucked. Besides taking our order, brining us our food, and our check we got NO SERVICE outside from that. Even if the food had been great, it was OK and the drink amazing, it was not. We would still never ever return to this place, and now when we return to Vegas we never will. The service was by far the worst I have ever gotten in Vegas. Super disappointed. The waiter had the audacity to circle the receipt what we should tip her. HAHA, seriously? My Tip was \"Check on your tables\". ! That's the BEST tip I am sure she has ever gotten. Recommend, NO Way! Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Definitely a place you try for the experience and the environment. The food is o.k., but nothing special. Honestly I would likely not go back, but it is a nice place and of you're more of a drinker partier, then you will probably enjoy this place."}
{"text":"The food is horrible. Not authentic at all. It was so gross I took one bite of my over cheesed food. Yuck. Only thing good was the chips and guacamole which we had to pay for. The salsa is disgusting and overly salted ewww :( never again"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here. Bloody Mary was excellent, pancakes and omelette were in point!  Will be here again."}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food! We ate breakfast and drank Bellinis. Definitely coming here again!"}
{"text":"I have past this place every single day during my yearly stay in Vegas. I always wanted to try it, but didn't know how the heat would affect my dining experience seated at the patio. 

It was surprisingly a great experience and great food. You have a blocked view of the Bellagio water but I just loved watching crowds and crowds of people pass by. The band was great.

I received my free margarita upon checking-in on yelp. Margarita was very strong. I ordered the \"Jack & Coke BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger\" I have to tell you I wasn't expecting anything great but the first bite I fell in love with this Burger. I finished everything on the plate including fries which were also great.

Next time, I will be trying the Jack & Coke Ribs"}
{"text":"What a beautiful place to sit and watch people and the bright lights of Vegas along the strip! Unfortunately the food was awful. Enchiladas verdes was too sweet, the chicken was tasteless, the rice was dry and flavorless, pinto beans had an \"off\" taste, and the asiago cheese smelled and tasted bad.  The salsa had a bitter and dark taste and the queso seemed to be a bit runny and tasted like stale beer.  I also felt like there was a phone signal jammer nearby used so that we could not use our phones and they could turn over the table. The waitresses took our check and our drinks and napkins and we weren't quiet finished wiping our hands. There are a lot of better places close by."}
{"text":"Had the pork tacos, flavor similar to tacos al pastor, but more tender pork. Good for people watching. Wait staff was very fast and friendly, meals came out quick."}
{"text":"Lunch out on the patio was fantastic!  Service was top-notch and food was stellar - I will return!  Our waitress (sorry forgot her name) was so great. I got the shrimp appetizer (cooked with tequila) YUMMM-EEEE!"}
{"text":"No clue how this place stays open. Food is WAAAAY overpriced, as are the driniks; service is horrid.  Four of us: we ordered 2 ceviches, 2 carnitas sopes, chips/queso and a total of 6 margaritas (at $10 a pop), our bill was $127.  $127?! The carnitas sopes came two on a plate with black beans and rice. The sopes had NO flavor to them. Zip. Zilch. Nada. They had to be covered in salsa and queso to even make it tolerable. Our waitress was nice, she was new, but getting drinks took an act of Congress.  Once the margaritas came, we had to ask 3 times for water, that seemed to take the longest.  On a Thursday afternoon??  Really??  I think they were bringing it in by the bucketful from the Hoover Dam. 
I've been to Cabo Wabo in Cabo and we enjoyed ourselves and the service; and even though I didn't think it was possible, this one in Vegas both sucked AND blew."}
{"text":"Bad service at first but Jason took over and from that point on it was great. Lobster enchiladas were possibly the best food I've ever eaten. Checked the sampler too and it had some good things. Guacamole was pretty tasty. Decent beer price and a high energy atmosphere give it a try."}
{"text":"The six of us came here after going to Sugar Factory and having a negative experience due to the hostess Hilary to where we could not even dine. The service we are receiving here is excellent from hostess, our server Alicia, bussers, and food. We will come back here next trip which is already scheduled. Atmosphere is great, upbeat. Good mix of music."}
{"text":"Went for drinks and were asked if we wanted to sit at the bar; I replied if we can people watch from there. 
Hostess then said, Oh, we should put you on \"the rail\".
So, we sat at the rail, under the water mister, drank pricey (but not short on liquor) drinks,chatted, maybe even had a smooch?! and people watched, and watched the water show at the Bellagio.

Our waiter (Marco, Marcus?..tall guy with dark hair and accent) was speedy, attentive and polite...even when one request was only for some water! (he earned and received a good tip)

Someone came and took our \"free postcard\" picture...We may have purchased the \"for pay\" pic, if only she had posed us so we looked representable...not just aim and shoot!

We thought it was an hour+ well spent!!!!"}
{"text":"Great location on the strip, live band playing, mango picante margarita...yum, steak fajitas....yum, love this place. Service was great too. Definitely will be back next time!!!!"}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I came here for a quick lunch while wandering around the strip. they have a fairly large and crowded patio that might offer some good views so long as you don't get stuck in the corner by the server station. The food was mediocre at best by my Phoenix standard for Mexican food. The service was a little slow as well.

As far as reasonable eats go on the strip you could probably do better but not without waiting."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to go.  Food is pretty good! atmosphere is fun and lively!  and if you are on the patio, people watching is the best!"}
{"text":"This  place is absolutely amazing 
The food 
The service 
The drinks 
And the view of people walking in the st 
Best lunch option"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after work before heading to the airport. Huge portions, strong margaritas, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"As many times as I have been to Vegas and passed by this place and seen people walking around with those ridiculous guitars filled with alcohol, I thought its about time we give this place a try.

Your in a Mexican joint so you must get a margarita and we decided on the Cabo-rita. Yes, that is the name. Kinda clever and kinda not. The margaritas were decent, decent amount of alcohol, and a decent lime mixer was used. Not too bad for a trendy touristy joint like this.

We just landed in town and we were looking for munchies, so we got the following appetizers:
* Lobster Taquitos - I actually like these a lot. A little too much. I would definitely order it again next time.
* Some Grilled Shrimp in Butter Sauce Dish (forgot the name of it) - This was excellent as well. The only negative was there wasn't more of it on the plate.

Overall, Cabo Wabo Cantina has good food and decent drinks. I can definitely see myself hanging out on the deck outside, getting smashed drinking margaritas, and eating good food. The only negatives to the place is the wait staff can be a little slow at times and our waitress would hide out so it was difficult getting another drink. All things considered, I give Cabo Wabo Catina 4 stars."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE, waiter dropped of plate of mixed sauces ranch, tarter sauce, all over of my friend. And all he said was are you okay and walked off without saying anything, people need to learn to have better customer service."}
{"text":"I just went there for the Super Bowl party and I was really impressed with the service and the food!  The wings were delicious and the servers came by very often!  It was generally just a really fun event!"}
{"text":"Tuna ceviche so tasty. Burrito insanely drenched in mountains of cheese. Fast drink service and fun loud atmosphere. I'll be back."}
{"text":"In search of food and out of the blistering heat of 103 degrees of Las Vegas, we ended up here just because we couldn't walk any farther. My soles were getting blisters.
The pitcher of margarita was average, but the steak nachos were awful!. The chips and steak were dry and no flavors were flattering my taste buds. At least the presentation was pretty...haha

That's what happens when you're desperate and don't read Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere.  The food is simply not that great.  And expensive even for Vegas.  Would come back for the beer specials and live music but not for the food."}
{"text":"Cool place. Great atmosphere. Bartender was just ok. Confusing Happy Hour. When the sign states 2 for 1 drinks for Happy Hour isn't it for everything ? Vague signage to draw people in.. ?"}
{"text":"In my opinion, it doesn't get better than Cabo Wabo - I don't know why the reviews are mediocre.  It's an awesome location for people watching right on the strip.  The food is good, not great, but it's reasonable quality for bar food.  The food and drinks are reasonably priced for Vegas and it's a great spot to sit out on the patio and chill for a few hours with a pitcher of beer (as long as you don't want to watch a game).  Not a good place to watch a game outside - most of the TVs are inside.  Overall, great experience for what we were looking for."}
{"text":"I loved the guacamole and lobster enchiladas. The sauce was sweet and spicy, my favorite tastes. The free margarita with check in was a great treat as were the birthday shots they brought us for our friends birthday!"}
{"text":"The margaritas are fantastic, the service was great and the appetizers were pretty good."}
{"text":"My woman and I came to this Cabo Wabo one afternoon and I had been wanting to check it out being a Sammy Hagar Fan and Mostly VH fan so I was pretty stoked.  We were able to sit on the patio rail which is the best dining seat aside from Bubba Gumps Patio seat so far in Vegas.... ( on the Strip I haven't had the pleasure of too many balcony Seat's thus far,  Still to come)  The patio is right across the street from the Belagio hence you get to check out the Water show (which is awesome) every 1/2 hour.  Also it's kinda the heart of the strip so People watching is pretty cool as well.  We were sat and waited on in plenty good time.  Everyone was very nice but quick.  I ordered Queso Fondido Con Chorizo and no alcohol since we don't drink although that part of the place looked like it did exceptionally well.  The Queso was super donkey good.... I loved that more than anything.  I would go back for that alone... even above the Patio Rail seating.  We ordered the Combo 2 (Gulf Shrimp & Grilled Top Sirloin) Fajita's.  They were good not the best but the accoutrements (grilled onions, peppers, cheese, Sour Cream & Such)  were awesome that were with them... The steak was just a tad tough and since the Shrimp while large were Jumbo Gulf Shrimp they were not plentiful however, all the same it was an above average Fajita dish.  All in All after touring the rest of the restaurant (A.K.A visit to the local johns and the Big Red Wall of hanging Photo's of Sammy and Friends) I thought it was an awesome place to eat and hang... I will return and not soon enough most likely.  I will however most likely get Taco's next time since those are my favorite Mex food. Oh, and as to why I gave it 4 Stars instead of 5 the music was very loud and I play and sing rock music (so, that is to say I love loud music) and the music here was super loud almost too much to even hear the sever.   ~Vegas Rob!"}
{"text":"This place happened to be really close by while we were waiting to check into our hotel.  Unfortunately, this place wasn't good at all.  I ordered the fish tacos.  They weren't very well seasoned and the salsa was pretty bland.  The cheese dip was probably the worst I've ever experienced at a restaurant and that's saying a lot given the amount of Mexican food I eat.  The only decent thing I had was the margarita (although severely overpriced) because it's hard to go too terribly wrong with tequila.

Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this place."}
{"text":"We came here last night for a late supper and  a bunch of drinks.  They have a nice railing to sit at at look at the passers by.  There is a bit of the view of the Bellagio fountain.  Too bad the seats were so uncomfortable.   We had tacos for supper.  I really liked my shrimp tacos. They were soft shelled tacos which is good as that makes them easier to control.  Fried shrimpa and I Thi k the crispy fries onions on top cane it a nice crunch. Tony had braised rib tacos I think.  Also good he reported.    The drinks were as expected.  I really did not like the I can't drive 55. But the ice tea was good."}
{"text":"I'm compelled to join Yelp and add my review of this place.  Simply put, the food is not good, and overpriced.  I wouldn't mind so much the expense if it was good, but it was bad.  Just bad.

When my partner and I arrived, we were seated by the hostess pretty quickly -- it was late on a week night.  We chose to sit outside, perfect spot for people watching.  We were informed that our waitress would be with us shortly.  \"She was in the bathroom\"!?  We waited and waited, and then waited.  Finally after she finished up in the bathroom , she arrived to take our order with indifference.  Apparently, we interrupted her potty time.

A long time later, some other guy brought us our food.  I ordered the combo plate --  2 taquitos and a tamale.  The taquitos were approximately 3 inches long each.  Finger food.. the kind you get in the frozen section at your grocery store.  The tamale was approximately half the size of the typical tamale you get at any other Mexican food restaurant, and about as good as a Swanson frozen dinner selection.  My partners fajitas smelled, and looked much better.  I wished I had ordered them.  He later informed me they were rather bland.  Not even on par with Chili's or any other chain restaurant.

Ok the drinks.... we both ordered the margaritas.  $10 for a small plastic cup!!  These were the kind you can get down on Fremont Street for a buck, and maybe not as good.  

Advice if you must go here --  Drink soda, sit on the patio for prime people watching, and don't order a combo plate.  Don't expect good food, so have some nachos or something.   Surely they can't screw those up, but I can't attest to it.  I didn't order those."}
{"text":"I'm surprise this place stays open, I assume it does good business since it's conveniently located on the strip.

take my advice and save yourself and eat somewhere else.

-they charged ridiculous prices for Mexican food. Expect $10-15 per person for a small plate. I order the 2 combo with rice, beans, chicken soft taco and tamale. It was not filling, and definitely not tasty. 
-chips and salsa was below par. 
-the guacamole was $10!!! for a small serving. The waitress did not bother telling us how much it was. 
-incompetent workers. Seriously, how hard is it get hot water? first time, you brought out cold water. We asked for hot water.
-Don't bother asking for suggestions, their not at all familiar with their menu!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Great food, great service.  We eat here every time we're in Vegas. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Don't bother booking a party because they will not plan properly either way.  We called ahead 2 weeks in advance, verified the reservation the night before and still had to wait 30 minutes for our table.  We were so spread out for our party of 12 no one could talk to each other.  Food is good and waitresses are very sweet. So for a small party, you're fine. But not the place for a big party."}
{"text":"I was drawn to this place by the awesome atmosphere and great location. The group I was with was a total of six people but they were very accommodating. The best thing about our experience was our awesome server Laura. Five out of the six people I was with are servers and every single person was impressed with her personality, great customer service and likability. If you ever go there, ask for her because she is awesome!"}
{"text":"I had a great Mexican chopped salad with grilled shrimp in a cilantro lime vinaigrette while seated at the outside bar on a gorgeous day. Well seasoned, delicious,  and a good portion size. It looked so good that 4 people around me ordered the same thing!"}
{"text":"Just horrible,  overpriced, no flavor and just all out bad.  My fiance and I  shared an enchilada plate and we each got a drink, and nothing was worth the price.  Our waitress said the drinks were strong and they weren't.  The food was bland.  Nothing special, taco bell would have been better.  Stay away unless you like tourist traps, bad food, and bad service."}
{"text":"Great food great service a little disturbing though that we ask for a jalape√±o and the cook charged us $2 for a pepper! Gotta watch out for that here. Manager took it off but in my opinion it shouldn't of been there. If you are going to charge for something as ridiculous as a jalape√±o you should disclose it not just put it on a bill. Kinda ruined my experience 
Awesome wait staff tho"}
{"text":"Standard Mexican food at sky high prices-- it's Vegas, check your expectations.  I had the carnitas platter and it was fine.  Nothing special and the pork was super dry, but definitely edible.  Luckily, I had a delicious cactus pear margarita to help me choke down the dry carnitas.  You have to pay for chips, but they give you a gigantic basket of it.  The service was surprisingly good for a busy restaurant.  All in all, not a bad experience, but definitely nothing to go out of your way for.  For the price, there are better options in Vegas, but if you have a hankering for Mexican food and margaritas, Cabo Wabo will hit the spot just fine."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and the nachos are the best we have ever had!! We loved it! Everything was delicious and the staff was amazing"}
{"text":"Cabo Wabo definitely is more hype than come thru.

Went there for drinks and food with one of my work colleagues. Waitresses are definitely dressed for tips as it's Vegas, but thought it'd be slightly classier coming from the staff. Only individual drinks applied for the happy hour, but you save more still getting the pitcher. Wasn't a very good deal, disappointing.

Food was beyond average. Tasted like something I could buy at the grocery store, so taking a guess everything is just freezed to prep. It's right along the strip, but still kind of taken back by how overpriced everything was. I wish we had went elsewhere, won't be returning."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, great location and the bartenders were great. Ordered mainly margaritas, mango and cucumber. They were both good but the cucumber was really the superior of the 2. Their prices were slightly high but i feel like those are the prices in Vegas. A pitcher of specialty margarita was $46 dollars without tax. I loved the music and their happy hour as well ;)"}
{"text":"I am surprised about the overall reviews. The food isn't bad. Prices are good. The cabo wabo margarita I got was WAY too sugary. I loved the guacamole!! If you are in the area and hungry, try it. I wouldn't go out of you're way to come here though"}
{"text":"We went in first time for lunch, great food,& service by Jordon. We went back several times would recommend every time.great music & drinks great   Place to hang out"}
{"text":"So I don't know why I checked in here for my recent visit to Vegas although I did come here when I visited previously last time I was here in 2011. Don't even remember what I had here almost 5 years ago to tell you the truth so being that other than knowing that I did eat here a long time ago I'll just go with it was okay...lol. I'll make sure to stop by my next go-around to Vegas to update my review."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars, but as a TexMex lover from Texas, I just can't bring myself to do it. The chips don't taste homemade at all. The salsa is pretty gross. The queso tastes like total shit. Literally, like a block of Velveta microwaved with nothing added in. The only thing this place has going for it is location, sangria, and an awesome server named Pete."}
{"text":"My sweetie and I came here for our anniversary.  The management took better care of us than we could have ever dreamed. Staff, food, view... all amazing. Highly recommend! We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Cabo Wabo Cantina!  Definitely make sure to ask for a seat on the patio outside; it has a gorgeous view of the Strip, and had great live music while we were there.  

I got the short rib barbacoa tacos and they were outstanding!  The meat fell apart and everything tasted fresh.  My husband also really enjoyed his chicken enchiladas, and the drinks were great.  I will say that the chips and salsa were not what we expected; the salsa is not really a traditional salsa, and tastes very much like chipotle chiles. 

The service was good, though the prices were a bit high (what isn't in Vegas?)  I would definitely recommend if you're near Planet Hollywood and looking for something with a great view."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the ballagio water show.... I left a pool party at Marquee and was able to cool down and chill with a appetizer sampler and a house margarita in my swim suit and take in the atmosphere. It was a quick walk from the cosmopolitan and the patio was elevated just enough that I see over the crowds in the strip. The inside looks pretty small so oitdoors was great esp with the mist spray on. The menu seems really good. Classic dishes with a modern twist. The bbq chicken wings were awesome along with the chips and salsa. I loved the queso dip with my taquitos. The sampler was enough to feed me and 3 others. The fish tacos were amazing and the chipotle sauce they add to it made it complete! The service was fast, friendly and they were always checking on us despite the full crowd they had going on. Can't wait to try something else on the menu next time...."}
{"text":"They have done more to piss people off with a Groupon they don't honor.  Would have been better off not having a Groupon.  We only had 3 people instead of 4 so they refused to honor the Groupon.  Hello people, 3 would eat less and it would cost you less.  Rude manager!  Offered to give me $30 I paid not $60 value.  We left and I will get a refund from Groupon.  Talk about bait and switch!!!!  Plus they have way too many table shoved together, felt like I was sitting with the people next to me."}
{"text":"Awful experience the morning of 3/9/17. Our party of three arrived and waited at the hostess stand to be seated. The hostess was flirting with a table of guys so we had to wait a few minutes before we were even acknowledged. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table which was reasonable considering how busy it was. When we were seated she places us along the rail right in the direct sun. When we asked if we could possibly be moved further down the rail into the shady side she just walked away without a word. 

Our server Brian M. greeted our table right away but it was all downhill after that. It took 20 minutes for him to arrive with our drinks. When our food came out, everyone's entrees came out except for mine. Our server never returned to check on us. Finally my friend walked over to another server asking her to please send him over. He came over and I explained I never received my entree. By this time ten minutes had passed since everyone else had gotten their food. Another ten minutes go by and finally Brian M. returns with my dish completely unapologetic. He was gone again before we could ask to order another round of drinks. 

The food was just okay, nothing spectacular. There are many other great choices along the strip. We will never return to this establishment.."}
{"text":"Great outdoor seating and such a fun place to have dinner with friends. Great food and delicious cocktails. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been to this Cabo wabo 2 times.  This is Sammy Hagar restaurant. He is the founder and owner of all the locations. Thhis Cabo wabo is located on the strip infront of planet Hollywood. 

They offer indoor and outdoor seating. The location is pretty big. Both times I ate here it was lunch. We dident have to make any reservations. The inside is all beach island rock and roll themed. There is a stage inside. The music playing on the speakers are loud. It's a good family spot. 

The food is chain style food Mexican flair food. The prices are good. I wasn't hungry this time. My cousin was starving tho. I just ordered a shot of vodka. With a chips and queso. The queso was good. Took a long time to get the queso. The waiter appologozed. My cousin ordered the grilled chicken mountain thingy. He ate the whole thing and said it was amazing. 

Overall Cabo wabo is a solid spot. It's a chain like Hard Rock Cafe or a margaritaville . But different food. The food was good for the price. Nothing special tho. Give it a try. If you like beachy and rock"}
{"text":"The inside dining area is too loud! I'm no grandma but I'd like to hold a conversation over lunch without having to yell like I'm in the club.

Rock Shrimp Tacos 3 for $15....ouch but yum. (best with plenty of lemons) $20 for Chicken Fajitas were alright but I liked the shrimp tacos better, the fajitas weren't as memorable.

Then we watched the staff do the Cha Cha Slide in front of the whole restaurant, it was awkward because nobody really cared for it and the staff wasn't that into it anyways. Portions aren't hearty for their prices but other than that it's still quality fresh mex."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great prices. 

We ordered the fajitas and thus far they're the best we've ever had. We also were pleasantly surprised when our child's kid order came with two delicious churros!"}
{"text":"Fun entertainment, great bar location, Best bartender, fun drinks that are always well made!

I've seen lots of places change over the years. Like New Orleans, the drinks got more expensive while the mixes got more sugar (less alcohol). Cabo Wabo is not one of those places. They stay competitive on the prices of the Vegas strip but the main thing is that you get what you pay for here! Alcohol! The mixes are delicious and the drinks are real.

The bartender was very friendly, had lots of energy, amazingly quick no matter how many customers they had, and had lots of fun while keeping the professional feel. That's amazing! We knew then, that Vegas only hired the best of the best.

We sat at the bar which is nicely situated facing the Bellagio fountains. It held an outdoor feeling without getting burned due to the architecture of the venue and had a fun energetic and interactive entertainer.

We had some light snacks which were surprisingly flavorful and innovative. Thanks! And thanks for taking a group pic of all of us with you guys included with our phone since you're the ones that made our vacation awesome! Great memories, Great times."}
{"text":"Tried Cabo Wabo in Vegas because the outside was eye catching. The food was ok, I had one of their burgers (can't remember the name of it) and their Mai Tai. The Mai Tai was delicious! The decor was cool but the music they were playing kinda didn't go with the whole vibe the place. The hostess looked like she was 10 years old w/tattoos all over, that was a bit creepy and we had no idea who our waiter/waitress was because they kept changing and no one told us anything or introduced themselves to us, so when we needed something we were kinda scratching our heads, because one minute someone was coming to our table asking if everything was good the next they weren't trying to help us but someone else would (& not that we kept calling them over because we weren't, maybe once or twice). Leaving the place was difficult. We couldn't find anyone to give us our check, all of sudden no one was around for like 15 mins, that was odd. Will I recommend this place to friends, probably not."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere where great! The service was quick and friendly! The delicious tacos and margaritas were a perfect combo! Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Very nice location and view with overpriced mediocre food!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere.  Great food. The service is a little slow but your in Vegas so take your time and enjoy.."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but it wasn't worth it for the food poisoning. I probably wouldn't have returned just based on the so-so food, but no one wants to have their trip ruined by bad food."}
{"text":"totally over rated. no taste. chips and horrible salsa are an extra $4!!!! my son ordered chicken fingers they were over cooked (hard!) and the service is even worse! our waiter was either drunk, high, or having a mild heart attack? everything was just bad!"}
{"text":"$11 for a washing-machine margarita on the Strip? Rude service, and the bar is chilly and drafty in the winter. Not sure why I got suckered into going here, but never again."}
{"text":"Albert was an amazing server! He was super quick and friendly. I will definitely be going back. The food was great and so were the drinks!"}
{"text":"I generally enjoyed this place.  I'm kind of a Rock and Roll fan and really enjoy Sammy's work (Chickenfoot Rocks!).  So, when I got the chance to go to one of his signature joints, it was a no brainer.  

First the drinks.  I had the Waborita.  Three of them actually.  They were, as expected, really good.  I've had Cabo Wabo tequila before and it's a good tequila.  These drinks were large and packed a punch.  Not to mention, they tasted good.

Second, the food.  The food was also good.  The portions were large.  Not super large.  But not small.  The food tasted good and the ingredients tasted fresh.  The salsa, which they claimed was XXX spicy, was not what I expected as XXX spicy.  It was hot though and tasted good.  

Next, the service.  Service was prompt.  The waitress was attentive to our needs and friendly.  Really couldn't ask for much more!

The price.  It's a bit on the high side.  But then again, you are in Las Vegas.  If you are looking for cheap Mexican-ish food, there are plenty of Chipotles and Taco Bells floating around.  The quality here is better.  Expect to pay more.  

Lastly, the atmosphere.  This is where I have my only real complaint about this place.  It felt like Jay Z, Pitbull, and Drake were on loop play, with the occasional rock song thrown in.  I know there are people that like that crap, but come on!  This is Sammy Hagar's place.  Play some damn Rock and Roll!

All in all, I recommend it.  Just be prepared to spend a bit above average and to hear some crappy hip hop pop junk music."}
{"text":"Me and  my  husband  went there  today  for  first  time  i really  enjoyed  the food and drinks  i liked  the atmosphere  was a little  pricey but when  my service  and  food  is good  i can  not complain  will  be  back"}
{"text":"The breakfast is excellent, lunch or dinner is ok I own a Mexican restaurant so I know about food, the reason on my 5 starts is the overall rating, love the uniforms, concept so that's how you get a 5"}
{"text":"The service received by Tamara today far exceeded my expectations. She was beyond attentive and genuine in her service delivery. She should be commended for her ability to build brand loyalty through her commitment in providing gracious and humble service.
If you are in Las Vegas and want to experience great food AND great service, GO to Cabo Wabo at the Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"Had lunch here I had the barbacoa tacos and my boyfriend had the carne asada. Also had the guacamole appetizer. All were super good. Plus their rocking iced tea is delicious. Our server Mariah was super nice and attentive. Great place for lunch. Misters and umbrellas make the heat tolerable."}
{"text":"Typical Vegas chain. Been here twice now and I can say the food is consistently OK. Kind of like an On The Border with a smaller menu and way more tequila options. Speaking of which, their tequila flight is reasonably priced (for Vegas) and worth it if you are looking to start your day off on that foot. Service was just ok the first time but the second time I was with a large group and service was excellent. Bathrooms are kinda weird, when you walk in you'll know what I mean. Misters on the patio in the summer which some people love. Not a bad place but not a Vegas destination by any means."}
{"text":"Food was enjoyable. A bit pricey for the type of food (which is why i rated it a 3 star)  but the meat was tender, the margarita was good and the food was plentiful.  I liked having the option to sit on the deck and overlook the strip while eating. We spent $56 on one margarita, a plate of three tacquitos, 1 small bowl of queso/chips and a fajita.   I could see spending, maybe $30 but not $56."}
{"text":"We sat outside to enjoy The Strip view and were treated to a good, quick lunch. We ordered food and in less than 10 minutes it was at our table. Amazing. Try the tacos al carbon platter, street tacos on corn tortillas with fresh ingredients and nice spices.

The wait staff was laid back and cool. A great view and a nice meal."}
{"text":"Stopped on for a margarita. Ordered the the CW top shelf margarita and it was sad, so sad. We sent it back and left. We will not be back. They used to be such a great resturant. Sad, so sad."}
{"text":"I came here on St. Patrick's day and even though the strip was super busy we were sat on the patio immediately. The service was spectacular, our server was attentive and nice and our food came out in a timely fashion. I got the chicken tacos and they were AMAZING. Some of the best Mexican food I've had on the strip. Would definitely come here again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"There is no way this restaurant should be classified as Mexican.

The good stuff first: I came here because of the location - it's one of the few restaurants that have an open patio on the strip. Great for people watching and checking out the Bellagio fountains.

Now the bad stuff: the food sucks. I felt like tacos and the server recommended the grilled fish tacos. He said they were really popular. I like fish tacos so I went with his recommendation. When I got my plate, there was a huge side of disgusting goopy fried beans (I had asked if they were black beans), oddly dry and favourless fried rice, and 2 very sad looking fish tacos. The tacos consisted of a thin strip of cold dry fish jerky with some shreds of lettuce and tomatoes. I managed to eat one taco and a few scoops of rice because I was hungry and left everything else on my place. The server took my plate away and didn't even ask about my meal. I really should have complained but I was just too tired to even deal with it.

I might come back for drinks on the patio but I would be scared to try their food again!!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent margaritas. Also, great views of the Bellagio fountains. Mediocre service"}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high for Cabo Wabo, but since I am a big fan of Sammy Hagar's song \"Heavy Metal\" from the Heavy Metal Soundtrack, I convinced my boyfriend to go here with me one night on our Vegas trip.

For one, a cockroach crawled across the middle of our table before our food arrived. We were in the outside cantina area, so maybe this can't be CW's fault, but several of the nearby tables were dirty and seeing that was pretty gross. 

Since we didn't leave after the cockroach incident (why) we were there to receive our steak and chicken fajitas for 1 to split. They were really, really bland. We discussed whether they had forgotten to season them or if this was the intended taste. As Texans we could not come to a conclusion about how this happened or what was going on. I've seen many 5 star reviews of this place so I'm now completely confused. We should have sent them back but were just a bit embarrassed. Our waitress was really nice and we felt bad for her. 

Finally we got the bill for $60, after two drinks, an appetizer and the most bland fajitas of all time. Not worth it."}
{"text":"The food was okay. There was a lot of it. The place was clean, but the table situation was very crowded. And the music overhead was SO LOUD! I get it. It's a rock & roll place, but I should be able to hear my own conversation. The service wasn't bad, either."}
{"text":"This was definitely the most disappointing meal I had in Vegas.  I'm accustomed to the concept of overpriced food on the Strip, so I couldn't totally fault this place for being any different in that respect.  The chips and salsa were great, and they were promptly delivered.  We ordered two combo plates, a Corona, and a house margarita.  The food was good: not spectacular, not horrible...just good.  We ordered the churros afterwards, and again, just good.  They had nice flavor, but were a bit on the overcooked side.  When the waitress finally brought the check around, though, we were appalled to see that a standard sized bottle of Corona was $9 and the small plastic cup of house margarita was $11!  Seriously?  The larger \"specialty\" margaritas that the table next to us ordered were only a couple dollars more and looked to be at least twice the size!  I was glad that we declined the refills she offered.

Overall, I wouldn't go back or recommend to friends.  The service was slow (with the exception of the free chips and salsa), and our server was inattentive bordering on rude.  The food was average for the most part.  Drinks were average and overpriced, even by Vegas standards."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Waited 20 min for a shaded outdoor table & got one half shaded. Asked hostess for a more shaded table, she said i had to wait... um isnt that what i just did?? Came inside, waitress took over 10 min to greet us. Drinks we ordered sat at the bar for over 5 so I got up to get them. One corona was warm. My crispy taco fell apart in the first bite, shrimp taco was super watery. Bad experience, will not come back."}
{"text":"Food was great, really excellent. Fish taco special, my wife had some kind of spicy pork taco, we had the guacamole app.  The mohitos were also excellent. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"My experience here was not the best.  I only give it 2 stars because their fajitas were pretty good. And even that wasn't worth the price. The atmosphere is loud and crowded and the service was terrible. Everybody was pretty rude. The drinks were okay, but again, overpriced since they were not strong. I wouldn't come back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"YUM!! My husband and I got lunch here while we were in Vegas. We shared the Dos Ceviches and the Appetizer Sampler! SO GOOD! Highly recommend the ceviche. Will definitely be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Don't bother!  I purchased a groupon for here and not only did they try to refuse it.when we came back 2 hours later for drinks they gave us even more nasty attitude.  Not the servers mind you the manager.  I reported this to Groupon and got a full refund for the terrible experience.

And to top it off the food is not worth the prices, it's good for about half as much money.

I say again DO NOT GO HERE!!! There are MUCH BETTER PLACES!"}
{"text":"Went here the weekend of the infamous Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight. This restaurant was located inside of Planet Hollywood. It was extremely crowded that weekend. However, when the four of us entered this restaurant, we were seated and serviced quickly. The food was awesome! Customer service was good, but wasn't excellent. However, no one was rude. They did what they were supposed to, but wasn't exactly working for tips as it relates to service with a smile.. That is the only reason I didn't give this establishment a 5 star rating. I would definitely go back though."}
{"text":"Service was AWFUL. After being seated we had to wait at least 10-15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us, and it was this arrogant rushed server that didn't even apologize for making us wait. 

The place felt grimy and dirty. Hard uncomfortable chairs and dirty booths. 

Drinks were terrible. I got the toasted colada with coconut on the rim that basically was a glass of ice with a little pineapple and coconut juice splashed in for looks. $15 for a glass of ice. My husband got the \"I can't drive 55\" and made it a double and it was $25!!! He barely got a buzz. 

Food was ok.  Chips and salsa were good, salsa was different, like a smoky salsa. They gave a massive amount of chips. 

We got beef tacos, they were ok. I got the Mexican style chopped salad. It was nice and fresh and I liked that they added celery. But I asked for grilled chicken to be added and when the salad came out I thought they forgot the chicken. Then I looked more closely and there was the tiniest bit of cubed chicken on the side. What a rip off. 

Our bill came to $85. I nearly had a heart attack when I saw that bill.  It really bothered me that I wasted money on such a barely mediocre place with terrible service. Would never ever go there again. Go to Nacho Daddy instead which has way better food, service and prices."}
{"text":"Stopped here with the intention of doing some serious people watching.   Asked the hostess for a table for two facing the strip and she obliged with two seats looking directly over the strip.

We ordered a pitcher of pear margarita, and although I am not a huge margarita fan, this concoction was good and I certainly had my share.   We also ordered the appetizer sampler.  The sampler was the perfect amount of food and it was good (as good as bar food gets).

Our server was happy, attentive, and did a wonderful job.   The prices are a bit on the high side but considering the view and the environment it was worth the price of admission. I forgot to mention that they had a live band playing.

If you are in Vegas and want to people watch day or night this is an excellent location."}
{"text":"We came to eat there great chimichanga to our disappointment they took it of the menu  so ordered the Carne asada tacos not  good to much fat on the meat, the chicken enchiladas were good .. Service was good"}
{"text":"I'll preface this review with, due to the horrible Customer service at the hostess stand, we did not even get to experience the food. Being a Vegas resident and someone that works in hospitality myself on the the strip I will never recommend this restaurant. My fianc√© and I were spending a weekend on the strip and walked over from Paris for Mexican food. We put our name on the waiting list and we're quoted 15 minutes. We walked around the area within a minute walk returned back to the hostess stand w/in 10 minutes to check in and were told our table had been called, we missed it and would have to start the wait again if we wanted to dine there. And we're told \"we needed to stay around once our name was on the list\" which we explained we were never told when we originally placed our name on the list. We were then quoted another 15 minutes for a table. Needless to say with the vast selection of restaurants on the strip we will never dine nor recommend any of our guests/family friends Cabo Wabo."}

{"text":"This review is only for the bar that faces out into the shops at planet hollywood. I'm giving it 4 stars because I loved the convenience and never had to wait! We would just walk up and get a shot or a drink on our way out of the hotel! Several times we had a really sweet young girl who said she was new, a few times we had a woman was kind of a...well...you know.  We got frozen drinks, fireball shots, regular margaritas and one time the coconut margarita I had seen on yelp.  Everything was fine but the last one. It was borderline gross and the caramel that they put on the glass to hold the coconut dripped all over me, my clothes, my purse and then the end table in my room.  I was bummed because I had been looking forward to that drink for months after seeing it on line. That drink could have been awesome, they need to rework the recipe for it."}
{"text":"The nachos were good but the margaritas were extremely over priced, they tasted good and looked pretty but I'm not sure if there was any alcohol in them at all."}
{"text":"This was one of my favourite meals in Vegas.  I asked the concierge at my hotel where she recommended we go for breakfast, and this is where she sent us.

Service was fast and friendly and the food was delicious.  Except for the breakfast quesadilla.  It was agreed that that was the biggest let down and was just kind of \"strange\".

My meal however, was delicious.  I had the CW Eggs on a skillet with Chorizo added.  The chorizo wasn't overly spicy or greasy.  Potatoes were perfect, and everything was topped off with a scrambled egg.

Other meals at my table included the same skillet but with bacon, two orders of the Huevos con chilaquiles, the HBLT Breakfast sandwich and the breakfast quesadilla.  As I mentioned, everything was a hit, except for the quesadilla.

I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Like many of the Las Vegas out door eateries I find that I'm drawn towards them like moths to flames.... tall alcoholic flames....(if you think about it, that's really dangerous)... 

I spend a lot of time at the PH and I've never been to Cabo Wabo, but I think that I'll be coming back here more often because their food is really really good. 

The thing I didn't like is even though I was outside I still had to yell at the people I was with to have a conversation... It's a restaurant NOT a club, and no amount of loud music and skimpy outfits can make it so...well maybe more skimpy clothing maybe....

Check back later to see how many check in's I actually have on it as well as a re-review in June after the Miss USA beauty pageant comes through.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Arrived in Vegas after a long day of driving from the Grand Canyon North Rim. Waited a while to meet up with our friends. When we finally met them we were on the brink of starvation so decided to go to Cabo Wabo (we were staying at PH). It couldn't be that bad, right? Alas, we fell into the age old trap of being starving on vacation, picking the first place you see instead of pushing on to find something better, and eating somewhere crappy.

We sat inside for the A/C. It is LOUD in there. There were only four of us but we were practically screaming at each other. We didn't want to order $14 margaritas, so we got a round of Blue Moon beers. They don't have a drink menu, so we found out when we got the bill that these were $8.50 each. Rip off. My friend ordered chips and salsa. The salsa was pretty decent. I got two chicken soft tacos. They were ok. A really huge portion, I could barely finish one of them. My husband got some kind of burrito smothered in cheese that looked disgusting. He said it was alright. 

We were seated next to an annoying stagette with a bride who thought it was awesome to stand on the table in her bikini bottoms singing along (badly) to Don't Stop Believing (eye roll). Props to the staff member who stood by her to make sure she didn't fall on her head. 

No atmosphere, expensive drinks, and bland, overpriced food. The only saving grace was that our waiter was a super hunk."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Cabo. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. Some of the best chips that I've ever had.
Over all an outstanding atmosphere and cool place"}
{"text":"After arriving in Vegas off of an early morning flight, we wanted to find a place to grab some quick lunch and where we could enjoy the beautifully hot and sunny weather.  We headed out from our hotel, Aria, and Cabo Wabo's patio fit the bill.  The second floor patio provided nice views of the Bellagio lake,and the misters under the umbrellas were an added bonus!

We started with some guacamole and queso which came with two huge baskets of corn chips.  The guacamole was ok, the cheese was really runny, and the chips were in tiny pieces which make dipping a challenge.

For mains, between us we had the Baja fish tacos, the jalapeno chicken, and the southwest cobb salad.  The chicken was a bit overcooked and dry, but the overall flavour was good and spicy.  The fish tacos featured grilled fish which was also a bit try, and they definitely weren't the best I'd ever had.  The salad looked great, and was a huge portion.

There definitely wasn't any food that would be worth returning for.  The prices were a bit expensive for what we got, particularly the $15 banana mama drink that was not that tasty.  The waiter was attentive, but was well versed in upselling, however not in a pushy way.

I wouldn't return, there are other restaurants in Vegas with equally decent patios that I would try first."}
{"text":"2.5 stars

I really wanted to like this bar / restaurant since I'm a Sammy Hagar fan and they have live hard rock music most nights. Great location on the strip in PH. They have a really cool patio where you can look out over the strip and people watch. The patio gets busy so you need to get a spot early or hold onto it once you have it.. 

They have a mix of live music, karaoke and jam sessions with famous musicians including Sammy when he is in town. Bonus if your lucky enough to be around when this happens. The bands are very loud in the evening so not a place to have a quiet conversation.

They specialize in Sammy's own tequila - Cabo Wabo. I'm not a tequila expert by any means but this stuff is strong! You can have it straight up, in a mixed drink or in a frozen drink blend. I switched to Beer after the first tequila, unfortunately they had a limited selection.

Food is average. We had the nachos and home made Guac. which was both good and refreshing (lot's of cilantro). The fish tacos were good as was the burrito.  

Service was good, we were given a table quickly and received our drinks within minutes. Not sure if we had a new survey on my last visit but they were not overly familiar with the menu details. The server also gave us some recommendations for various bars to visit later in the evening.    

Prices were on the higher end for what you get which is why I rated Cabo 2.5 stars. I would go back depending on the live music in the evening but would grab dinner elsewhere before arriving. Stick with drinks and appetizers given all the food options in Vegas."}
{"text":"Watered down frozen margaritas and mediocre food.  The one in cabo is great which is why we wanted to go.  With all the choices nearby save your pesos."}
{"text":"The steak nachos were good but the place was a mess. Stunk like sewage. And they seriously need sun shades inside. Was a very disappointing experience. Won't be going back. Sorry."}
{"text":"How could you not love it here!? Great atmosphere  great location, great food and drinks. Just a fun escape, feels like you're lounging at some beach cantina - you forget you're in Vegas. Good music and overall feel.

(Tip - if you sit outside, ask for a table in the shade - it's well-worth the longer wait. If you're in the direct sun, like we were, you'll roast and sweat if you don't ask and once you lock into your seat, it's tough to move because apparently those seats in the shade are locked up by those waiting in line. We eventually got to move though (since they realized we were in for the long haul that afternoon, haha... many, many drinks.) 

PS - Swear this is true but that night after Cabo I had a dream like Point Break where I was in charge of finding the head of a surfer crew who was robbing banks, lead by Sammy Hagar. I found them surfing at a cove in Mexico, chased him up a mountain side to the edge of a cliff where he jumped, turned in the air, flipped me off while smiling, pulled a ripcord and base jumped. He cut the cord in the air, tucked and rolled, yelled and took off in an awaiting jeep.

Um... yeah. That dream was probably because of the combo of Sammy' music, too much sun and too many drinks, haha."}
{"text":"Service is indifferent. Total tourist trap. The food is alright but overpriced for what you get. But then it's Vegas. Enough said!"}
{"text":"Terrible, horrible, awful service. The servers were nice enough, but they were so incompetently slow that had I not been with classy people I wanted to impress, I'd have thrown a full-blown fit.

We sat down for a \"quick\" breakfast three hours before our car to the airport was scheduled to pick us up. The place was dead, and we figured we'd get in and out with time left to throw the last of our self-respect desperately into a slot machine. Heavens, were we horribly wrong. This gorram breakfast took 2.5 hours due to (1) the awful waitresses who kept disappearing for half-hours at a time and (2) the sssuuupppeeerrr ssssllloooowww kitchen. We never, ever got drink refills because the waitresses never bothered to come check on us. We had to ask for our check. We almost ate our arms off waiting for our food. The food, when it did arrive, was ok and it was cheap, so the place won't get one start on those merits."}
{"text":"This is your typical Mexican restaurant complete with huge pitchers of drinks! We were going shopping at the Miracle Mike shops when we stumbled up this place. 

Even though the sun was shining we sat near one of the heaters outside. We started with a pitcher of Bahama Mamas. The pitchers are $46 and for us held about five tall glasses. I had one during lunch and my sister had two then we both got a to- go cup to take the rest with us while we shopped. Totally worth the money given you can pay $16 for one drink at the bars here. 

As far as food goes make sure you order the chips and salsa. The bucket of chips is huge! We each ordered a burrito. Nothing special about the food but for the locations and drinks I can see us returning again."}
{"text":"Ummm HELLO this is Vegas, you're right out on the strip and you lure people in to eat at your establishment. But tell me as I'm crossing the threshold, outside drinks aren't allowed. 

REALLY?!?!?!?! Ok, well I damn sure ain't buing one from you now. I'll have water with my meal. Thanks!

**food wasn't all that, I've had better down the way at Margaritaville...ijs."}
{"text":"Had a pitcher of margaritas, queso and carne asada tacos. Their margaritas are the best. Loved the tacos. The portions aren't that big like most Mexican food places and I'm not a huge fan of their queso but this is one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Wanna be margaritaville. Served small potions and the food came out cold.  Did comp the cold meal so that was nice of them."}
{"text":"Only came for drinks but the margaritas were great.  The hostess, Diana, was super friendly and helpful!  Good place to stop in for a drink/dinner while shopping at the Miracle Mile Shops...."}
{"text":"This place is fun and has some awesome drinks. Prepared to be full when you leave here because between the drinks, the chips and the food with large portions, you will not leave here feeling light. 

It is a fun atmosphere, touristy, but still fun. I love the coconut margarita! They come around and take your photo while you eat (the touristy part I was talking about) and then you can choose to purchase it, or just take the free post card photo. 

I have been here 3 times over the past few years and always have had good service. My friends and I split the veggie fajitas. We split the portion for one, but with chips and guac we were still stuffed. 

Make sure you have some margaritas, they are yummy!"}
{"text":"Salsa was good, it was just like Chevy's. 
A good selection of tequila too. 
Fajitas were ok, chicken was better than the steak. 

Monday at 8pm, the place was packed, but we were seated quickly only to experience slow service & sub par food. It was so loud we couldn't really talk much.  Over all, dissapointed that Sammy Hagar would be using a mediocre place, just to make a buck & sell his tequila."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to trying out Cabo Wabo after reading all of the great reviews. Getting seated was quick and easy, the hostess was great and the service was good unfortunately the food was only give or take. Disappointing but the atmosphere made up for it"}
{"text":"The location is awesome; we sat on the deck and could see the fountains at the bellagio perfectly! Our waiter was really friendly and efficient and did a great job with everything from taking our order to correcting a mistake on the bill...that he actually picked up on not us. I think his name was David...thanks David! From other reviews I was kind of expecting mediocre Mexican food, but I got the portabella fajitas and they were nothing short of AMAZING; the mushrooms and vegetables were grilled and seasoned to perfection, and served piping hot. My husband raved about his meal as well. We will definitely be back next trip!"}
{"text":"Loved this place so much that we came a second time on our following trip. The service was excellent today as was the food!"}
{"text":"Now I am not a chain guy but my wife and I had the pleasure of eating there Wednesday night and it was amazing. The pork carnitas were spot on and my wife's chicken enchiladas were better than great. Plus your sitting outside facing the Belagio fountains which go off every 15 minutes and great live music."}
{"text":"Great food and an awesome waitress. Trish took care of us and made it a fun dinner. The margaritas were definitely a good call!"}
{"text":"Simply Came here to snack between shopping and drink beer. Had a good experience here on a Saturday mid afternoon, It was packed. But 2 of us got a table after 15min. Then then waitress juggled it just right, no complaints on service. When I did need another drink and saw the waitress was busy taking another tables order I simply asked another waiter and he delivered no problem. Food was good, the shrimp tacos ,delicious. I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Sunday evening (6'ish).  It happened to be a place to eat on the walk back to our hotel.  Patio was full but inside it was half empty.  Got seated immediately.  I knew it was a tourist trap but even with that I was surprised how bad the service and food was.  Had to beg for our (mediocre) chips and salsa.  After 20 minutes of not getting our drinks this time I called for a manager.  He told us that our server got tied up with a large group.  I guess our group of 7 was not large enough.  Finally after asking him for our drinks he went and got them.  Having ordered a $7 draft Coors Light he brings that back 3/4 full *sigh*.  

At this point, we just want to get our food and hope it's at least decent for the outrageous prices they charge.  Nope...wrong.  I ordered a steak soft taco and steak enchilada.  If you like the $2 steak tacos at Taco Bell then you would like these.  Seriously, I couldn't taste the difference.  Out of 7 dishes, only 1 person said their food was actually good.

Continuing on with the bad service after waiting to get our check, we all added up our totals.  We were in the process of leaving our bad tip (sorry I usually tip well but this was terrible, un-apologetic, bad service) when a different (new) server comes out and asks if she can see the check because she believes she needed to add something to our bill.  Yeah right...

I know the patio has a nice people/fountain view but avoid this place if you can.  I love Sammy Hagar but he failed especially with this place."}
{"text":"Good time, went with a Groupon which was totally worth it. Our waitress was really nice."}
{"text":"This review is for the margaritas only. We were wandering around the Miracle Mile shops and decided to get ourselves a yard long drink. YUM. $20 for 42oz of goodness. =) The server there (i'm sorry I forgot your name) was sweet, and friendly. She also let us try every drink before we made our decision, AND she color coordinated the straws to match the drink. (nice touch).

We got the Dreamsicle and the Vida Loca (taste like blue otter pop). Both were delicious. Creepers too. You don't taste any alcohol for a little while, then you feel a little flushed. Great combo! And great drink to have while you're strolling the strip."}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch and although the food was really good, the service wasn't good at all. Our waitress hardly ever stopped by unless we flagged her down and the hostesses or whoever the group of girls were that stood at the front weren't very friendly either."}
{"text":"Ambiance:  Definite Cabo feel.  I sat indoors at the bar, but think sitting outdoors would be a fun feel in Vegas.

Food/Drink:  Had nachos, a couple specialty cocktails, and a fried ice cream.  The nachos were plentiful with a nice blend of toppings.  I didn't necessarily love all the cheeses in their blend, but it was good.  They sprinkle on cojita cheese which should be mandatory for all nachos.   I had a alcoholic version of an Arnold Palmer which had fresh mint, which was refreshing, along with a new berry based drink which was also great.  The topper was the fried ice cream.  They put a coat of frosted flakes on it, and it was easily one of the best desserts I ever had.

Service:  The waitresses/bartenders were friendly, and on top of everything.   Being the strip you would hope app servers had this down.

Price:  Slightly pricey.  You do pay for the location and name recognition, but certainly not exorbitantly priced.

Overall:  Great experience, excellent drinks, solid service, good food.  Next time I am staying in the area or with a group of buddies I will stop by."}
{"text":"If you are coming just for margaritas then it's perfectly fine. However, if you are looking for food don't expect you're waiter/waitress to pay any attention to you or even get you're order rigt."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a snack and drink.  Patio is nice, but the uncovered tables can be ridiculously hot.  drinks were ok... good, but nothing special.  salsa and guacamole are good.  chips were pretty bad.  i think they make their own, but the oil wasn't hot enough or something.  they were super greasy, but also tough. bleh.  i also got the lobster taquitos.  sounded interesting, so figured i'd try something different.  regretted that move.  not good.  the lobster tasted super fishy (never a good sign).  had to drown them in salsa and guac to make them edible.  it's a meh kind of a place."}
{"text":"Not good. The outside seating is remarkable in itself. The view of the fountains, the ambience and the general people watching is some of Vegas's finest but the food? Yuk. The service, sad. We had appetizers and drinks...during what they call happy hour. The servers were far from happy. Each one looked and acted miserable. No smiles, no small talk just sad. The food was like frozen appetizers from your grocers freezer. And the frozen margarita special was lame. The cup was so small and a hundred of them wouldn't have given you the slightest buzz. Total dissapointment. Never again, no matter how hungry I am or how cool it looks. This place sucks."}
{"text":"Definitely good Mexican food and great prices for being centrally located on the strip. I had steak fajitas and they were delicious! Only \"complaint\" is that you pay extra for rice and beans. Boyfriend had an enchilada and he said it was good. Server was awesome, wish I could remember his name. Super attentive! Also had lots of TVs so we could watch the olympics. Would recommend for a \"cheaper\" but good Mexican dinner on the strip."}
{"text":"This past weekend, my boyfriend and I made the trip to Las Vegas, and on our first night there, after I saw a concert, we were hungry, and I made the decision to go to Cabo Wabo Cantina, due to its location (downstairs from our hotel room at Planet Hollywood) and their menu offerings. We decided to sit outside, and were seated promptly by the hostess. 

After we were seated, within a couple of minutes, the server showed up, and took our drink order; I let her know we were still looking at the food menu. She left to get the drinks and I later advised her we wanted an appetizer, which didn't take too long to get, which was some type of cheese dip with chips and salsa, which I thought were good. We paid $2 extra to have carne asada added to the dip, but not much meat was given. Things went straight downhill from this point. 

Our server took our dinner order, and left. We were enjoying our chips and once we began sipping on our cocktails, we both felt as if there was barely any or no alcohol in the drinks; the drinks cost $15 and $16. We didn't make a stink about it, but way after finishing dinner, my boyfriend advised the server of the weak drink, and she gave a lame excuse about some type of pour they use there. We usually order 2-3 drinks each at a restaurant like that, but since we were cheated, we opted to drink water after that. Once my boyfriend received his meal, it was clear my meal with not coming at the same time. I waited and waited and waited, and there was no meal. The server, who was not the person who brought my boyfriend's food to the table, asked me if something was wrong with my food. I politely said, \"I haven't received it yet\". She walks away, I'm assuming to go check the kitchen for my meal (which happened to be the chicken enchilada plate, with beans and rice), and she did not offer an apology for what happened. I told my boyfriend to go ahead and eat his food, so it wouldn't get cold (he had fish & chips), and I waited 10 minutes longer to get my plate; still no apology from our server. 

As things were winding down at this place, our server decided to bring us a free plate of churros and dipping sauces, for what happened to us, but we politely declined. Neither one of us was interested in eating anything else, let along those sugary treats. We paid our bill and left. my boyfriend asked me if he should have asked to speak with the manager, but I told him not to bother, especially since we were given virgin cocktails and paid a lot of money for it. I'll go back to Margaritaville next time. Beware if you're buying alcohol here, and you should read some of the other negative reviews this establishment has received here on Yelp, since other customers have had similar experiences there."}
{"text":"we had a groupon, so decided to give it a try.  I had the cheese crusted quesadilla and my bf had a chicken burrito.  He said his burrito was pretty good, I was quiet impressed with my order, being an appetizer, it wasn't much, but it was big on flavor! Our server, ( I can kick myself for not remembering his name) was awesome!  He wasn't even supposed to be our server.  He came over after noticing our table was wobbly and he fixed it.  Then he told us he didn't know where our server was but he had waters on the way.  He earned his tip right then and there.  He continued to take fantastic care of us.  When our entree was delivered, it was delivered by someone else (our intended server)?  Who knows, but this kid settled our bill and we left him a nice tip.  Hopefully he got to keep it and didn't have to share it."}
{"text":"The hostess / person seating us was very rude. Acted like she was doing us a big favor to seat our party of 6. The food was good, but not worth the attitude. Won't be returning. There are too many other great places to eat in Vegas where you are welcomed in."}
{"text":"Hectic, tasty, loud, fun. Always poppin and busy. Reasonable prices and drinks are not bad."}
{"text":"Only reason for the 2nd star was because of the waitress. Forgot her name but she was very welcoming & had good customer service. Kitchen HAD to be backed up because it took forever to get 3 fish tacos. Once they actually arrived i was very disappointed. In this case this late arrival was definitely not worth the wait. No flavor, had more cabbage than actual fish. Did not even finish the platter and trust me when i say i could eat lol
Did not get to try the drinks, will probably not come back."}
{"text":"Our recent visit was on Friday 11/7/14 with a group of 11 girls.  We opted to sit inside since the wait for a table outside was 1.5 hrs.

Guacamole - was delicious
Calamari - it was ok
Spicy Grilled Gulf Shrimp fajitas - the shrimp were humongous and delicious.  This gets 5 stars easily.
Chicken Sabana - Another amazing plate....would get next time for sure.

Service was good, our food took kind of long to come out, but I guess it was because we had a big party.

Will def come back when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Two words - velveeta nachos.  Not what I was expecting. I can get these at the ballpark. Plus we had to flag down a server when there were very few people inside not only to take our order but to get refills and a check. Poor service."}
{"text":"Huge portions. Had shrimp tacos and it was good. Jalape√±o chicken is also highly recommended."}
{"text":"Fun to people watch along the Strip, but drink and food prices are high. Along with relatively high prices, at least compared to the bargains you can get in the Miracle Miles cafes, the service is poor.  We have gone in the afternoon before, and they were having a frozen drink special, offering blue margaritas (very sugary, out-of-the-machine variety), for only $5. In terms of food, the tacos are $15 for a small portion, so we opted for only chips and salsa. For the higher price, you do have make a trade-off in terms of being right outside, on the Strip, able to watch the craziness of the Las Vegas tourist scene, while sitting soaking up some sun."}
{"text":"Location is great, service is lacking, they seem understaffed or something. Also, none of their chicken wings are actually spicy even though advertised as such. Good drinks, ambience, location,  especially if on the patio during good weather but average otherwise."}
{"text":"Our bartender Ron was friendly & attentive. We just wanted to stop in for a few quick drinks & chips, he made it an enjoyable experience by giving us such friendly & prompt service.  I ordered a Stella on tap & although they had just run out he quickly had them replace the tap so I didn't have to wait at all."}
{"text":"This place was really cool and had a great atmosphere.  I went here for drinks along with 3 other people and we sat at the outside bar.  I have never eaten here so this review has nothing to do with the food...although it smelled delicious!

We sat in the back and all the tables were very, very close together.  So close that my chair was about an inch from the other table, it was hard to hang my coat on the back of my chair.  I understand it's a busy place located in the strip but I felt like I was trapped.  Our server arrived and he was very nice and animated.  We informed him that we were there for drinks ahead of time.  We had two mojitos and beer. The mojitos were delicious, but the beer tasted watered down, a little funny.

Overall it was a good experience, and the server was great.  I would go back to try the food but I would sit inside this time.  I hate feeling like I'm intruding on someone else's dinner!"}
{"text":"Don't let this \"tourist\" attraction restaurant fool you to thinking you will be eating mediocre food and drinks. We stumbled upon this place late night (1am ish) ordered chips and fresh guacamole (like the kind you want to stop eating but you keep going back for more) the chips were nice and thin. Perfect combo for the chunky guacamole. We also ordered some pitches of sangria for the table and requested for some fresh jalape√±os inside, the bartender not only did the add on but but his back into it and muddled the jalape√±os into the sangria. What a great drink it turned out to be... a little costly but at least it tasted good and was not watered down. We also ordered: cilantro jalape√±o chicken... da bomb! Our waitress was attentive and sweet. I'm very impressed at the restaurant especially since it seems so touristy since it's smack in the middle of the strip. I would definitely go back and take advantage of sitting outside and people watching."}
{"text":"Nothing too special. Paid a little over a bill for 9 shots of patron. The bartender was very friendly though."}
{"text":"Ive read a lot of mixed reviews about this place on yelp but everyone i know in person has told me the food is delicious here. This is a very chill environment but nice and neat at the same time. There is a nice view of the strip, so we sat outside. I brought my Bf to celebrate his B-day here and we were impressed by how nice the waitress was, always checking up on us and making sure everything was okay. I ordered the shrimp tacos, i loved the chipotle sauce on them, i even ordered extra on the side. I'm not a huge breaded shrimp kinda person but for some reason i was feeling these, it wast overwhelmed with shrimp. My plate came with rice and beans they were good too. My bf ordered the carnitas plate, i tried some of his duhh.... The meat was nice and tender and flavorful. We got Churros for desert, 4 come  in one order. We really enjoyed them because they weren't super sweet and sugary it was just the write amount, it came with 2 different dipping sauces to add extra flavor."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently took our 19yo & 17yo for a long weekend in Vegas. We were typical sightseers and as we were walking down the Strip, we saw the inviting patio of Cabo Wabo and thought that would be a great place to eat lunch. We had a short 5-10 minute wait (extremely great in Vegas) before we were seated under a huge red umbrella by a very friendly staff. Our waitress, Tammy, was the best! She was extremely friendly, helpful, and she did a great job of giving us ideas of what would be good to eat and drink. She was totally on target with the Cabo Rockin' Iced Tea - it may have been the most refreshing drink I've EVER had. She continued to give us ideas of what to order and we probably stayed there and ate and drank longer than we would have because she made our visit so pleasant. Our food was great, service wonderful, fantastic experience. We all highly recommend this place as one of your stops in Vegas!"}
{"text":"So I ventured out alone on the strip for breakfast and I decided I was going to give Cabo Wabo a try. I did not regret it at all. I sat on the bar stools facing the strip. It was a very nice view. I ordered the Cocorita and made it a double. It was delicious!!! For breakfast I ordered the breakfast sandwich. It came with eggs, ham, bacon, lettuce, tomato, on a soft bread and with potatoes. I didn't expect it to be so huge! Despite the fact that it was a big meal, it was so good that I devoured it. Best part was, since I was facing the overlook to the strip, I got to see two ladies undress and paint their bodies in preparation for their \"show\". It was absolutely hilarious watching people's reactions as they walked by and saw two girls painting each other in red white and blue with their goodies out. I decided \"well, this is fun\" and ordered another drink. This time it was the \"can't drive 55\" and I didn't make this one a double because the Cocorita had me tipsy. I noticed that now two men joined the girls. Now this was entertainment. People either loved it or hated them lol. So, the food was delicious. The drinks were strong and the \"views\" were out of this world. My server was the kindest lady ever. I recommend this place and make sure you get a seat that overlooks the strip!!!'"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast the other day, chosen mainly because I had a 20% coupon for the place from our hotel. I was still feeling a little rough from our outing the previous night, so I didn't try any cocktails, but the server was quick to bring over some water (and kept it coming).  I had the Eggs Benedict, which was very good.  You got a nice side helping of some potatoes, so it was a very good amount of food.  I would have liked the eggs to been a little less done, I prefer them a little more runny, but I also could have specified this to the server. Overall, great experience. I would definitely go back and give it another try for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"$45 for two frozen machine margaritas and two shots of Sammy Hagar's shit tequila.  They print on receipt suggested tip of $12.  This place stunk like they had sewer issues behind the bar.  It left such a bad taste in my mouth that I will flip the station next time I hear a Sammy Hagar song."}
{"text":"I recently ate at Cabo Wabo in Las Vegas.  The food and service were OK and the prices were  reasonable.  

However, you need to be aware of the scam Cabo Wabo will put on you when you're not looking.  One of the members of my dining party ordered a $9.00 draft beer off the menu.  Ok,...$9 bucks for a beer is high, however it's the Vegas Strip so that was expected.  

What wasn't expected was when we got the bill, he was charged $18.00 for his $9.00 beer.  We asked about it and the waiter told us the beer is $9.00 and the \"commemorative\" Cabo Wabo glass was an additional $9.00.  WTF!  $18.00 bucks for a 22oz beer?  Needless to say the $9.00 surcharge was reflected in the waiters tip, since he didn't warn us about that.

Buyer Beware!  This is a scam and a rip-off!  Also, you're stuck with an unwanted glass that you have to carry around with your when you're walking the Strip."}
{"text":"It's okay. The 2 for 1 margaritas with the miracle mile coupon book are still overpriced as the one is $10 and its only 12 ounces. We received a complimentary postcard with our picture on it which was pretty nifty though, also had a view of the bellagio fountain show since we sat outside!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and guacamole. We had a great time people watching on the Las Vegas Strip on a busy Friday night with live music playing."}
{"text":"Check your bill. We ordered a pitcher of house margarita (we were given and charged for the margarita verde $11 more - didn't realize until after leaving) chips and salsa, a quesadilla, and tacos. The bill was $99 - 4.7 CNF fee (concession and franchise), $3 split plate fee (x2! Because my husband ate off of mine and my mother in law's meals). Absolutely ridiculous. For mediocre food at best and a crappy atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time here I would have given 5stars but 3 starts it is. Food was great and fast the atmosphere is electrifying and exciting and fun. Amber was on top of everything thank you  but the way other servers were talking to each other next to guest and all on there cell phones was not hospitality like"}
{"text":"This place had hands down THE best portobello mushroom fajitas. I would come here time and time again just to eat those! Our servers were quick and payed great attention to us, considering we were a table of 25 it was good. Some of their margaritas are very syrup based and tasted way too sugary, but the cucumber jalape√±o one was delicious. (However, it was $26 for a regular size). Cabo Wabo was a fun environment for our large party but the pricing was so expensive. My $16 plate of fajitas did not come with rice and beans (added rice for 1.50).

Had to take off one star because the bathroom was a scary scene. Looks like nobody got to cleaning after someone threw up on the floor in one stall and spilled a slushie in another. The third and final stall was out of order."}

I'd gladly eat here again if money isn't a concern. My gripe is a hidden \"CNF\" charge you find on your bill. This is a \"franchise fee\" equal to 3-4% of your total bill. I think it's totally wrong to charge this after the fact. Then just add that amount to each menu item. Just seems shady if you ask me. 

Steak fajitas 5 stars
Jack and coke ribs 1.5 stars

PS another in our group nearly choked to death (yes really) on a chicken bone that was close in size to a tooth pick. This was in a dish that was comprised of some type of pulled chicken. The waitress witnessed him choking.  The manager came out and tried to compensate him for the life threatening incident with a shot of booze from the bar!!?!?"}
{"text":"Always try to come here when in town because its a great atmosphere with great staff who take care of you with really fantastic chow, great drinks, specials, and music with a superb view of the water show at Bellagio and the street.  Tamara took exceptional care of us.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing service from Tierra! The fish and shrimp tacos are sooooo good I got the three shrimp tacos and subbed one out for a fish (mahi mahi) omg they where
Sooooooooo good a Must have when going here !   The salsa is great as well. Not the cheapest place but defiantly with it In my opinion."}
{"text":"Great location. Good food. Fair service. Will go back. Outside seating nice. Turned on heaters under umbrellas."}
{"text":"The place has good food, friendly stuff and fairly nice, casual atmosphere. Drinks are overpriced (as is common along Vegas Strip), but the food we got was plentiful and tasty. The servers were friendly and helpful. The wait time was so-so, but it was a busy Friday evening so that's acceptable in my book. I will come back for lunch or dinner on a future visit to Vegas (esp. if I get a groupon or similar deal :-) )."}
{"text":"Very good food and even better cocktails! Portions were huge! Servers are all so friendly and efficient.  Bronson and kristen were our servers. They were great and made us feel like family!!! Definite must do when you come to the vegas strip."}
{"text":"Great food! Great drinks! Great staff! The sangria was delicious. Our waiter was a sweetheart. Cabo Wabo at this point would have gotten 5 stars from me until I checked the bill. Cabo Wabo charges entertainment fees and or service fees aside from the auto gratuity. Strange and unusual, yes, but they still do it. 
A great place for drinks and dining but always check your receipt for mystery fees."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and drinks. Great food and awesome service! Aie is amazing and she took great care of us!!"}
{"text":"3.5-4 stars. 

The Good:
Great location, awesome to sit outside and people watch while drinking mango margaritas. These people ABSOLUTELY know service. Possibly the friendliest/funnest servers I met all of vegas. 

The Bad:
Food is mediocre. I ordered a burrito hoping to get a huge cheesy burrito filled with sauces and rice and meat. Instead I got served what's more of a \"chicken wrap\". All it had was chicken and some lettuce inside. Not exactly the calorie bomb I was hoping for.

And at no surprise considering its on the vegas strip, it's pricey! Table of six, we all had an entree and 3 pitchers of margaritas. Came out to like $275"}
{"text":"We stopped in here on our last trip to Vegas. We wanted to grab a few last cocktails on The Strip before catching our flight home. 
We went to the bar; the counter seats were full, but not one of the 30+ tables had a guest seated. We let the hostess know we'd like a table since the bar was full. She asked us if we would be having lunch there as well; we just ate and were not interested in dining, we just wanted drinks. Both of the hostesses that were there informed us that they could not seat us at a table if we only wanted drinks. I MIGHT understand this if there was a high demand for tables, but keep inmind that NO ONE was seated at the tables. They couldn't spare one table and serve us drinks?!?!
We asked \"you're really going to turn down paying customers because we don't want food?!\".....her response \"it's our policy; we can't seat you if you're not ordering food too.\"

We went a few doors down to La Salsa Cantina, and had a couple of delicious margaritas & food was not mandatory. 

Why in the world would you turn down a paying customer?"}
{"text":"This was my first time in Vegas and my first time at Cabo Wabo Cantina. I love this restaurant. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. I went there with a friend after a long day business seminar. We were both starving. At first they seated us inside but we requested to be seated outside. They sat us under a high table and chairs under an umbrella with a heat lamp since it was somewhat chilly. We were able to see all of the passers by and the light show. So nice to see. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup as my appetizer and we had chips and salsa to share. The salsa was spicy and smoky how I like. For my entree I ordered the beef chimichangas. It was music to my hungry stomach!  It came with guacamole and more chips with nacho cheese.  It was so delicious. Even after a large dinner, I ordered dessert to go. I had the bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. Omg, heaven for my taste buds! If I'm ever in Vegas again I will definitely come back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Aia was an awesome server very attentive and the food and drinks were awesome Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Most of the reviews for Cabo Wabo pretty much say it all.

-yes, the food is a little pricey for what you are getting....But come on people you are in Vegas and nothing is cheap in Vegas.

-Yes the drinks are served in plastic cups, but who cares it still does the job required so no complaints here.

-Yes the view is pretty as it over looks the strip.

-No the service does not sucks....at least for me it did not. Our waiter was very attentive and nice and offered us great deals and coupons. 

-The food.....Yes it is bland and kind of overpriced for not so great Mexican food ....but again, you are in Vegas. I had ordered some kind of salad. I think it was a chicken tortilla type salad. It was super greasy and upset my stomach. The chips and salsa dip was ssooooo good. I wish I can have some right now. My tequila shots were great and did the job....I only wish I did not have beer right after since I got wasted....

-Another plus was that we were seated right away......I was kind of between 2 and 3 stars since my meal was not so great, but the service and drinks pretty much gave it a 3..."}
{"text":"I think rating Cabo depends on what you really want out of it. If it's sitting at the patio - drinking tequila, margaritas and beers - it is a cool setup and great view. The Red Rocker, Sammy Hagar owns the joint and they blast classic rock all night on the patio of the new Planet Hollywood.

The food was meh. Pretty average, but not terrible. We stayed next door at the Paris, and the Cabo patio served as a great spot to meet up to catch a buzz.

I ordered tacos, nachos and enchiladas in my two different visits. Think of a spicier \"Chevy's.\" The Grilled Poblano Nachos were exceptional - the rest was just aight.

The service was spotty both times too. 5 stars for drinking spot, 3 stars for food, 2.5 stars for service. Let's call it a shade above a three-star experience."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't know why this place doesn't have better reviews. 
The food we ordered was actually very flavorful and tasty! We ordered chips and guacamole with a side of salsa as an appetizer. Guac and salsa were not spicy, but had good flavor. 
We decided to share the Tacos de asada, which came with 3 street style tacos, rice and beans. I'm glad we did, because the chips and salsa/guac were very filling! Everything about the tacos were delicious. The tortilla, the meat, the onions, everything! The rice was also good and fluffy, how Mexican rice should be! 
The environment was fun. Lots of people of course, because it's .. Vegas. But over all a welcoming experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, Great Service.  I am in Las Vegas 6 to 8 times a year on business. I always bring clients here and always make sure I am served by Laura.  Laura is incredible as is the entire staff at Cabo Wabo."}
{"text":"Meh...Came here for chips and salsa and some margaritas. We originally wanted to people watch on The Strip, but unfortunately, it was super windy outside, so we weren't able to sit outside. However, on a good weather day, I think that their bar-style seats outside overlooking The Strip would be perfect for this! 
We only tried the chips, salsa and guac, and overall was pretty underwhelmed. The guac was really plain. The margaritas were decent though. The interior feels like a little bit tacky -- but after all, we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here with a group of friends. Service was friendly and attentive. I had the fish taco which was very good. The food came up quick. We also ordered their margarita in a pitcher which gives a glass for 4 people. Unlike most Mexican restaurants the chips and salsa aren't provided free, if you want any you have to pay for them."}
{"text":"Nothing extraordinary about this place, but I digged it.  I ordered their nachos, which was good for the most part.  Ordered a couple of Mimosas too, but I would skip on them.  They came in small plastic cups and were expensive and I didn't even taste the alcohol!  However, I would definitely recommend sitting outside.  The umbrellas actually work here and they provide a good amount of shade.  And it's perfect for random people watching!  In a non-creepy way."}
{"text":"Giant patio. People watching. Fountains. Cheap margaritas with QUALITY tequila!! No Cuervo Gold here!!!! Calamari was great but the margaritas were better!"}
{"text":"We came for a Bachelorette Party of 22 people. We were in and out within an hour and a half. Great service, no orders messed up, great service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. My group and I were not expecting a 5 star dining experience walking into Cabo Wabo but what we weren't expecting was  to be so dissatisfied before our food even came. Our server recommended the specialty Cabo Wabo margarita because it's \" made in house\" and the other marg was basically a mix. So we ordered some pitchers and then some chips and salsa. When the chips and salsa and drinks came we were so hungry we dove right in. The salsa tasted like burnt cigarettes, and the margaritas were the worst I have ever had. Too sour and soooo watered down. Mind you pitchers were $45 so we were expecting something much better. We decided we didn't even want to give the food a chance (I had previously heard a table behind us talking about how horrible the food was.) We asked to cash out and got out of there as fast as we could. I
will compliment the manager for only making us pay $30 for a $100 bill. Yes $100 for horrible chips/salsa and margaritas. We then headed over to HEXX which was amazing and a much better experience."}
{"text":"One would expect world class food and service with such a high profile name but sadly it was just ok.  The service started out good but as the place got busy our server seemed a little overwhelmed and the end result was service at a snails pace.  I ordered the hot wings which turned out to be not hot by my standards; my wife has the quesadilla which was excellent but a little on the salty side.  The nights winner goes to my sons plate which was the carnitas - he loved it. It was quite a tasty dish!  The ambiance was fantastic and the Las Vegas attitude made up for any shortcomings!  A solid three stars."}
{"text":"I'm sticking with a solid four stars for Cabo Wabo after my second visit! I hesitate to say the service was lacking, as our waitress was a total sweetheart. I'm more inclined to say that there is a bit of a timing issue with the food/drink preparation as we had some lengthy waits for drinks and for chips (after getting our guacamole). 

I can overlook service hiccups at Cabo because the food is DELICIOUS. The chips, salsa, and guacamole alone make this place worth a stop. I also can say only good things about my chicken enchiladas, as can my friend regarding her carne asada tacos. The rice side here is special as it's not just red slop...almost more like a paella sans proteins! 

Of note, my Mango Picante margarita was not particularly strong, but it was pretty and tasty."}
{"text":"My sister & I came here for lunch this past Saturday.  Sat outside to enjoy the scene on the strip.  Even though it was so hot, the mist they have for the customers make you feel refreshing.  It was enjoyable to sit outside. The music, waiters & atmosphere was so fun.

While we were waiting, the music was bumping & this ladies wanted to dance w/ the waiter. He was fun & was dancing w/ the customers.  It was entertaining.  They also take your picture & give you a complimentary souvenir picture. You can also buy larger photos if you like.

I ordered chips & salsa, & carne asada quesadilla. I love how they make the tortilla crisp & their beef is delicious and tender.  It's served w/ sour cream, guacamole, & hot sauce.  The portions are more than I can eat.  Affordable & worth dining here.

The only thing I didn't like was the greeters stand in the heat outside. They should have the mist on them also since they're standing there the whole shift.  They looked beat & I felt bad for them.  

Will come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed.  Server forgot about my order. Probably for the best so I saved $15."}
{"text":"Came here during NYE weekend aka mayhem and alllllll the people. Waited about 30 minutes for a table and when we were sat we didn't get acknowledged or even see a server for a solid 20 minutes. We saw a couple open spots at the outside bar and moved ourselves. Best decision lol. The bartender was great and super friendly. Our food came our really quickly, and was hot and fresh. Definitely recommend the shrimp tacos 3 large tacos with a ton of shrimpies! Great place for people watching too!"}
{"text":"WORST PLACE EVER. 

I was hungry and wanted a drink and an outdoor place to sit. My boyfriend and I sat down and ordered two margaritas. $12 per. - that isn't the bad part. 

Because I was desperate for a snack I ordered the cheapest appetizer on the menu- chips and salsa for $8! 

EIGHT DOLLARS! For nachos you would get free anywhere else. And they were so greasy I couldn't eat them. You have to understand I love junky food, but this was SO bad. Just disgusting. 

This place gets one star because I HAVE to give it something to rate it.  In all fairness, the server was nice and the location is good (across from the Bellagio fountain) but save your money and buy a 6-pack, some tostitos and sit out on the sidewalk if you want a good view of the show. 

Is this what you wanted, Sammy Hagar?"}
{"text":"Overpriced, tasteless food. With all the affordable but tasty food in Vegas..why settle? PF Changs next door is miles in comparison...delicious food with a great happy hour lunch special with dunks and food...don't settle! We ended up here, bc it was the first place we saw, and we were all starving after our flight from NY...never again"}
{"text":"Fish tacos are amazing! Free margarita when you check in as well! I ate here two days in a row while in Vegas. A must try for sure."}
{"text":"YIKES! Unimpressed. 

I have a pretty strong stomach and this place did not leave me feeling well. Maybe it was because of the overpriced food or the sugary drinks but either way... not good! I know Cabo Wabo is a chain so you can't expect gourmet food but for what I paid, I expected something edible. 

Our server was very nice and that was the only really postitive thing about this place."}
{"text":"Good service and good food. Pricey but Expect it on the strip. The server kept calling us love, which reminded me of that South Park episode where they went to Raisins.  we sat outside - great location"}
{"text":"Fish tacos were just OK, would result in more stars, except the service was horrible.
Sat at the bar, was ignored by the bartender. After receiving my food, and finishing beer # 1. My food get cold waiting for another beer, utensils, condiments, etc....
Too many good places on the strip to patronize a poor establishment.
And when the Karaoke started, I couldn't wait to get out of the Wabo."}
{"text":"Loved this place! It has a super chill vibe and the food/drinks were great! The tacos are street style & great proportion for the price. I would definitely  go back."}
{"text":"Came here for specifically for the patio and drinks.

Ordered 3 pitchers of Margarita which were all good. The patio was really nice as the weather was perfect.

Our server was really nice as she constantly checked up on us.

We ordered the avocado fries... It's fried avocado. Damn that was unique and amazing!!"}
{"text":"I can see why it gets 2 stars...hmmmm
Got a pitcher of margaritas...ahhhnnmmm...
Average and steak nachos...less than average.
Made like a baked cheese tortilla, blah...
Learned a leason, Diablos Cantina much better.
I believe after are walk back from Doubledown in 102 temp we just wanted a beverage and saw the mirage of alcohol swimming on this Mexican wannabe... leason learned. 
Stay with the taco trucks on Fairoaks and beer in
My cold frig..."}
{"text":"Good food, great presentation, decent service. The patio is nice to people watch on the strip and they have misters to keep you cool during the heat of the day. The prices are a bit high but it's probably just due to the location"}
{"text":"This place sucks and the food isn't that great. Really shitty service. I came one time and won't come again. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican food spot in Vegas! The food is just as good as all the reviews say. And they make everything big. They also have micheladas that are pretty good as well, I wish they would advertise them more! I would of come sooner! 

Overall nice experience. The patio view is really nice. Staff is friendly and food is delicious. 

Don't forget to order chips and salsa it's not included but definitely a must! They make their own chips and salsa it's so good. They come out hot!"}
{"text":"Great bartenders! Met some great people from my home state of Michigan when we were here. Good location. Sat outside on a hot and sunny afternoon. More misters would have been nice, but we enjoyed our margaritas and beers!"}
{"text":"We had a 20% coupon for Cabo Wabo, so we came here...but forgot the coupon. Story of my life.

The drinks were good, but too expensive. I paid more here than I normally pay in NYC for a cocktail.

The food was good. Especially liked the salsa, nom. We also came back for brunch, and that menu is good too. Liked the breakfast quesadillas. Also too expensive.

The scene is non-existent. But keep in mind, we were sitting inside because it was a cold night out. Warmer evenings overlooking the Bellagio fountains are probably superb.

Server was super friendly. Gave out a free shot for our birthday girl.

All in all, a good enough spot to eat. Maybe save it for the warmer months."}
{"text":"Visited Sammys place and came away impressed. Service was great, only letdown was the margaritas. Wife is a huge fan, and felt these were way over sweet.  
We started with the chips and salsa. Salsa was fresh and cold, blended into pulp. Chips were crisp and fresh. We had the queso as well. Great mild cheese, with pico on top. It was great. 
I had steak fajitas. Fabulous. Steak was covered with a cilantro type chimchurri looking thing and a huge portion of peppers and onions. The beans and rice were Baja style. The guacamole was a standout. Fresh flour tortillas. 
The wife had the Spicy tequila shrimp. This was amazing. It's only letdown was the dirty rice, which was bonded with cheese. Too cheesy. Also, not spicy. But god, the flavor. Over the top. 
Overall, meal was excellent. Lose a star over the margaritas."}
{"text":"Not the best. I love Sammy Hagar, but DAMN IT!! This is another poorly executed theme restaurant. The Monday through Friday happy hour is good. 2 for 1 drinks and half price apps from 3PM to 6PM."}
{"text":"Awesome for tacos!!! If your in Vegas this is definitely the place to go! Not to mention the outside view on the strip"}
{"text":"Total tourist joint, but the Groupon made me give it a go.

Let me just say that if the service weren't so horrible, this place would probably be a four of five star. My waitress took 20 minutes to bring me water after I requested it.

The food:

They have the best salsa I've had in a long time. Not too spicy and amazing flavor. I could eat it plain. I also ordered Cadillac Nachos which chicken. Amazing! Not a lot of chicken, but great flavor. Contender for the best nachos I've ever had.

The liquor:

I think I ordered a Daiquiri. I don't drink a lot. I will say that they aren't stingy with the alcohol. I could liquor overpowered the drink. My mom loved it. Me, not so much. If you like you drink, you'll be okay with it.

I would come back to this place. Hopefully I'd have a different server."}
{"text":"Indoor and outdoor seating. Friendly service with amazing burgers. This was my first and last food trips to and from Las Vegas. It was that good. Their fries are unlike any others you've ever had. Great drinks and great environment. Highly recommended! I'll defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Our waiter was awesome! Service was pretty quick and the food was good. They were quick to seat us which was nice because it was Friday afternoon around noon and super nice out. We really enjoyed the guacamole and queso!! The margaritas were also good!!"}
{"text":"BEST Coconut/Pineapple Margarita, Table side Guacamole, & Lobster Enchiladas I've EVER had!! Amazing meal & fun to sit on the strip & people watch..."}
{"text":"When on vacation or close to home we all have our \"go to\" bars and restaurants we favor most of all to sit and enjoy some time. I found this place for my stay in Las Vegas, on the strip at Cabo Wabo Cantina. Upon arrival, what better way to gear up for a week in sunny Las Vegas that enjoying some great music, in perfect view of the southern portion of the strip, with a Margarita on the rocks with a salted rim. The outside music is played through some really nice sounding, full range sounding speakers and the genre is mainly that of classic rock. 
Two Margaritas with a caddie and I was off, knowing I would soon return.
Unlike more hostesses at many dining establishments on the strip, I had come to the unfortunate realization that most are disinterested or too busy gabbing with a coworker. Addressing the party properly and getting them seated promptly in the dining area seems to play second fiddle, these girls did just that.

The three juice Mojito which is not on the menu, but a quickly thought concoction of pineapple, strawberry and something, the juice was a puree I thought to try something different.

Straight forward menu of traditional Mexican dishes, nothing too dangerous or risky. The Carnitas platter once served looked like a skimpy little nothing plate for one, once we began to dig in the pork showed its density. Seven hand rolled flour tacos later and two people were nicely filled,  if you add in the chips. No up charge for a few additional tortillas. The Macho Salsa will really clear your sinuses as it was the hottest item I had all week and I order everything hot. 

Great service by our server Ron, who kept the drinks coming and did whatever it took to make our wisit to Cabo Wabo an above average dinner experience, he deserves special mention."}
{"text":"We enjoyed lunch here today!  It was a great place to lunch with a party atmosphere.  CW seems to have a good wait staff. We also met the manager, Jason , who was very helpful with information when we enquired about acquiring tix for a Vegas show. Side note:  The \"house\" photographer gave us a complimentary photo of our visit.  

We ordered chips and salsa and a pitcher of margs to start.  Heads up:  The portions are very generous.  We really enjoyed the margaritas, and my Cobb salad was excellent.  We mentioned we were celebrating a special anniversary and our waitress surprised us with Fried Ice cream at the end of our meal.  Dessert was amazing...words fail to describe!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love it here. Its a Must to come have their amazing margaritas and food each trip I make to Las Vegas. 
Their service is 1st class. Our server Wendell was amazing this visit,ask for him! Ambience is for all ages,food is great, and its super clean. 
Put it on your vegas must do list!!!!!!! The tequila is sooooooooo smooth!!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't know if we were so hungry or just picked some awesome items but this place was great!! 

Our server was amazing, very attentive and sweet. We ordered the spicy wings with fries, the chicken nachos, and some asada tacos. Had a few beers and a raspberry mojito that was amazing!!!! I literally chugged the mojitos from this place and I rarely drink. 

Was a great place for small bites, drinks, and people watching lol. Also had good live music. 4 of us shared the items mentioned above and left about half because we were stuffed. 

Pina Coladas were also really good here!"}
{"text":"It's a fun touristy place with good people watching. The food is decent- I didn't like the salsa but the carnitas tacos were good. It's a good place for a fun atmosphere but not the place for fine dining in a Vegas"}
{"text":"Great food, had the short rib burrito, very good and my boyfriend & friend loved their food. Atmosphere is fun and friendly, had the sweetest server + got a FREE margarita for Yelp check in... Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Ok the food was ok. And the service was good but the price is ridiculous. I don't mind paying for a good meal but double is not acceptable. This place is not fancy it's just a tourist trap bar and Mexican grill. Avoid and if you want to spend a lot of money on a meal go to a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast. Had a Denver omelet with crispy potatoes. The toast was dry and lacking butter; asked server to bring some to the table. Salt shaker pours too freely, and you have to shake the hell out of the pepper to get anything. Server (Garland) was attentive and the food was good. Checking in on yelp gets you a free house margarita."}
{"text":"Service and drinks are good. The food was so so. I got a huevos rancheros and my girl got the breakfast quesadilla. Both we extremely mediocre. Nothing special at all. The huevos rancheros had way too much sauce. Not that I would usually complain but it wasn't traditional ranchero sauce either. If you are grabbing drinks I wouldn't recommend checking this place out but not for the food."}
{"text":"Location is awesome for people watching if you sit along the elevated glass railing overlooking the strip. My wife and I sat outside but near the inside of the restaurant. I was not impressed with the food but the location was amazing. The food was just ok I thought by the restaurant sitting on the sidewalk on the strip in front of the Miracle Mall I expected more. I did like the mist sprays to cool the air."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here but I never wrote a review so I wanted to make sure I reviewed my visit from yesterday. While the food came out incredibly fast, my entree did not seem as though it was prepared fresh. I ordered shrimp tacos and they came out with almost no warmth and in tortillas that were semi firm. That was super disappointing because on my first visit this same dish came out hot with shrimp that were freshly cooked. The tacos also seemed to be overstuffed with cabbage and only contained three shrimp per taco. It definitely wasn't an entree worth the $18.95 price tag. I also ordered two appetizers, chips with salsa, and hot wings that came with a side of fries. The salsa for the chips was nothing to be remembered but the chips did come out freshly cooked. The wings came out fresh but the fries had obviously been sitting bc they were not nearly as hot as the chicken. The flavor on the wings was great, but cold fries made this dish incomplete and underwhelming."}
{"text":"Honors groupon and yelp deal! I love u waiter! Had great food- great ambiance. Probably best bang for the buck on the Vegas strip hands down (besides earl or course cause that's a different type of food) if u like Mexican u like cabo wabo plus the yelp and groupon perks u get!"}
{"text":"Omg the food is awesome and I am a Mexican American. Our server was great Jona was outstanding. We will be back again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place this past Dec when I was in Vegas for my milestone birthday.  We went around lunch time and although reviews stated they get crowded, eating indoors was no problem.  The food was good.  We had tacos, and nachos and I had drinks.  I actually visited this spot on my birthday and the waiter kindly gave me a free drink after learning that it was my birthday.  He was very personable and attentive without being pushy.  To my surprise, there was also someone in there taking pics of you (if you wanted).  The pic was so nice, we decided to pay for the memento.  It was a nice experience overall and we'd go back whenever we are in town."}
{"text":"After a long flight we got our free margarita! Completely worth it- and ask for Brian and he will not let you down!"}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for a weekend getaway and walked over to Cabo wabo for some margaritas and was very pleased with the service at the bar. Shane at the outside bar was very friendly and accommodating. Talked with my boyfriend and I the majority of the time and was a great guy to conversate with. Definitely a great spot and outside bar to visit and just hang for a while. Great service from Shane. Cheers!"}
{"text":"TLDR: Good drinks, good atmosphere, reasonably priced food. A nice place to go if you want to grab some drinks and a bite without paying an exorbitant amount.

We dropped by here the first night of our Vegas trip to grab some drinks. We were mainly here to try their drinks but I was hungry so I also ordered some guacamole. The guac was really good and came with in a decent portion. It cost around $9 and there was enough to share with the group.

We only ordered one drink here, the cocorita, and it was delicious! The drink itself was pretty good, but the honey coated coconut crusted onto the rim of the glass was the best part. It was so good, the drink is definitely worth getting just for that coconut crust.

We also tried some of the drinks and snacks that the rest of our table ordered. The Salsa was a good price for a pretty generous portion. It had a little bit of a Chipotle flavor in it which I wasn't that into. The rest of the drinks were all just ok, I don't think I tried enough of them to know if I liked or disliked them."}
{"text":"First timing dining at a Cabo Wabo, and will definitely visit again!! Our service was polite and frequent, Brian was very responsive to our needs which is always good in a large group including a baby. The food was delicious and came out not long after we ordered which is awesome because they were starting to get busy and had a band playing.. Summer the Manager was also polite and attentive. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for good food, good drinks, and excellent service!!"}
{"text":"I mean, I didn't get food poisoning but the quality and quantity, along with the price and atmosphere definitely earned them 2 stars. I have had better food at Roberto's for a fraction of the price. Simple request to leave something off the plate seemed to result in the opposite, I got extra of a food I hate! There was enough jalapeno in the guacamole that it could have been made with mayonnaise and green food coloring and it would have tasted the same. I was unable to discern any actual avocado for the excessive heat. Oh and the chips were hard and thick, like the ones you get at the dollar store."}
{"text":"We walked over from the Cosmo and were able to get seated right away for lunch. 

SERVICE - Our waitress was Christin and she was super sweet! Very upbeat but not overboard. She brought our drinks out fast and refilled our waters when we were low.

Appetizer Sampler - This came with taquitos, chimichangas, cheese quesadillas, chicken wings, and a nacho skillet. All of the items were relatively good. We are from San Diego so Mexican food is amazing there. However, all the items on the sampler were tasty. 

Vojito - This barely had any alcohol in it or tasted like it had none. The overall drink was great if you don't like the taste of alcohol because you taste nothing. It was very fresh with berries in it."}
{"text":"Bryan was great! Good service, good food. Loved this place before the Britney concert."}
{"text":"I really loved this place! The line to sit on the patio is quite lenghty, so make sure you do reservations WAY ahead of time. We had a party of 5 people and it took almost 45 minutes. 

The food is awesome! They had this awesome DJ singer playing and he had such a cool vibe. He even gave me a shot out and a free shot because I was celebrating my bachelorette party! 

The guac and salsa are to die for!!! I loved my chipotle fajitas!!! Yumm!!!"}
{"text":"If I could rate it less I would.
I came here for my dinner during my birthday weekend and it was absolutely 
horrible. We were greeted friendly by our female server. 

Sidenote: My boyfriend and I both work in the restaurant industry, him as a 
kitchen manager and myself as a Front of the House manager so we are
usually very patient and understanding when it comes to restaurant 
problems.

After waiting 17 mins (I looked back to when I checked us in on facebook
when we sat down) for drinks we munched on chips and waited for our
server to come back and take our food order. She didn't come back. 20 mins
later I saw her and flagged her down and she walked right past me. Not long
after she comes back and takes our order. I ordered the carne asada and my
boyfriend had fajitas. After waiting 20 minutes and looking around I noticed that
our female server was leaving and a male server was coming on to take her
place. She told him that we were fine, not waiting on anything. 15 minutes later
when we finished our drinks he came over to our table and asked how we were
doing. I said our food was taking really long and he said he would go find out
what was going on. He talked to our old female server and she said 'oh sh*t' 
and then asked what we had to order again. We saw her go in to put in the order
and 18 minutes later our food came out with our new, male server. He acted
as if everything was ok. Over an hour later and 3 rounds of chips and salsa and
we just now got our food and it wasn't even that hot. I told my boyfriend if I said
anything I was going to get really upset because we had not even been 
apologized to at this point in time. Our new server dropped off the check
with NOTHING taken off and didn't even apologize. We flagged him down and
explained that we had waited so long and it was ridiculous not to have anything
done to our bill. He then apologized and we got $15 dollar off our $120 tab, after
ordering more drinks in the mean time. I didn't know if I was more shocked
that no manager was informed of this situation or the fact that I can remember 
the situation months after it happened as if it was yesterday.

Shame on you Cabo Wabo. You ruined that night and my experience 
at your establishment. Do you not have a manager on duty to deal with
guest complaints?"}
{"text":"Sure not the best margarita I've ever had, the food was just ok.-I have made better at home.  Service was slow , considering there was less than 10 people in the place during the day- there  decor was all right, nothing memorable. It's a not a second trip type of place for me.  Been there, won't go again, not awful just mediocre."}
{"text":"We just flew in from SD for a wedding and this is the first place we hit up since it was close to the hotel. We were here on a Thursday evening, live music and good food ~ what more can I ask for? 

Our waiter was great and the atmosphere was fun. We were seated in the patio area near the live music and a perfect spot for me to people watch. Yes, I'm a low-key stalker...j/k.

It was too early in the evening for me to booze it up but it looks like it could be a really fun place to come back to.

I tried to stay on my eating clean health kick which it really hard in Vegas but I got the Cobb Salad and water. I forget what my hubby ordered but it looked really delish. The service was quick. We never felt rushed and everything was priced accordingly for Vegas. 

I'd definitely come back but this time I'll try some of there other menu items and maybe booze it up a little."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp tacos, my niece had the El Green-Go Burrito. They charge for chips and salsa... and for me anyone who charges for chips and salsa is lame. I'm from houston and we have the best mexican/texmex food around, so as far as the food goes its just 2 stars for me.

The shrimp tacos were good, but just ok. same with the rice and beans. I've had better. Too many other great food places in vegas to spend money here. My niece said her food was good, but also mediocre. probably wouldn't be a repeat for me. 

The staff was very nice. that was probably the best part of the experience. That is all. :)"}
{"text":"Very poor service even on a Monday... Drinks are good, and salsa is a little runny. Eh not my favorite"}
{"text":"Kristy and Melissa were smoking hot and last night had crazy fun - I think we went to the white chapel and I was just going in to have one beer..."}
{"text":"Below average Tex-Mex food.

Experience:
The wait staff was friendly and attentive.  The place is just like anything else in Vegas, loud and tacky.  

Food:
The food is mediocre, but the portions are huge.  It's nothing special and it could be worst.

Overall:
It's a tourist trap, but what do you expect from Las Vegas strip restaurants?  The food is over priced and the place is tacky!  However, they have a large patio for you to eat and people watch. 

It's a great place for drinks and people watching."}
{"text":"Decided to try some nachos at Cabo Wabo Cantina and maybe spot Sammy singing I can't drive 55, but no such luck, he wasn't anywhere to be seen.  The basic nachos were a bit on the expensive side $15.95 and we added pork to bump it up to $17.95.  I thought the nachos were tasty with plenty of jalape√±os, cheese and cheese sauce, guacamole, sour cream, refried beans and plenty of carnitas.   A nice little touch when u check in and order an entree, you get a free house margarita with what else but Cabo Wabo tequila.   We had a fantastic waitress, Deanna, who took good care of us."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican food restaurant in Vegas. We make it a point to come here every time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere, food and service all deserve 5 stars based on our experience! If you get a chance to have Sarah as your waitress, you are in for some of the best customer service around.

Great place to go whether meeting local friends or friends just in for the weekend!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Plenty of it. Place was an it loud and our waitress was very busy kept forgetting stuff and had to re-ask. But overall it was good"}
{"text":"Came here to grab some margaritas and a few small plates to share during the middle of the day. We sat outside and the place had a really great, lively atmosphere (but I guess you get that everywhere in Vegas). Great place for people watching, not only at the bar, but also the people along the strip. Decent playlist of music too! 

We ordered a pitcher of the house margaritas, which is premade. The waitress informed us it was premade before ordering and tried to convince us to upgrade to the margaritas that were made from scratch. We didn't listen, but we should have. The premade mix lacked tequila and was a little heavy on the sour mix. Our next pitcher, we switched to frozen (also premade) but found this one much, much better. If you don't want to pay the additional $10 for the \"from scratch\" margaritas, definitely get them frozen.

For food, we shared the queso dip and added chicken to it. This also came with free chips and salsa. The queso was pretty standard, but was disappointed that it wasn't the traditional white queso they serve at most restaurants - kind of looked like it was melted velveeta (which it wasn't). Was disappointed by the lack of chicken that was included in the queso, since we paid additional for it - definitely not worth the upcharge, as we only got a few pieces in it. The chips themselves were great and were warm when served. I personally liked the salsa that came with it, but my friend did not like it at all. It is definitely not a traditional salsa, but am unsure which ingredient made it a little different. 

We also shared the chicken taquitos, which were amazing. They were served immediately after being cooked, so they were nice and warm. The chicken inside was moist and not overcooked, as most meat in taquitos tend to be. The outside was crunchy. It also came with a good helping of guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gaillo which was nice to dip into. 

Overall, would definitely go back for the atmosphere and frozen margaritas and would be willing to try some different food."}
{"text":"Very overpriced for the portion size.  I ordered chicken enchiladas, which were barely lukewarm when they arrived.  $2.00 for a side of sour cream, which should always be served with enchiladas, not as an extra side.  The rice and beans did not taste fresh or homemade, rather something that came out of a can.  No chips & salsa and the drinks were way overpriced as well.  Completely disappointing, I will never go back.  Our bill came to $75 with one drink each and our dinners.  Not to mention the chairs were extremely uncomfortable, no booths so we didn't have an option."}
{"text":"Okee Dokee, This Sammy Haggar inspired cantina has a Gluten free menu. What a great day for the anti gluten folks.  Thanks Sammy and the Corporation behind the Cabo Wabo Cantina Franchise. Good selection and prices with a Groupon."}
{"text":"I love some good Mexican food. For me, the more authentic, the better. However, when I know that I'm not stepping into one of those real Mexican spots that are peppered throughout the valley, I re-calibrate my expectations. That said, my brain and tastebuds were set for a good American influenced joint, a nice menu with depth in selection and good quality food to match the higher prices- common for the Strip. That's exactly what I got. I always see a lot of people on their patio, so I was excited to try Cabo Wabo Cantina for myself. The goal was to spend $100 because I had a gift certificate. The waitstaff was cordial and accommodating. Our waiter knew the menu very well and had no problem expounding on what was offered. I milled over the selections and finally ordered the sampler as an appetizer which gave us a selection of 4 or 5 items. It was tasty. Next was the main course. The portions were sizable and it was apparent that we wouldn't be able to finish. I barely made a dent in it! This could be partly due to the particularly weak Margaritas that we ordered in the interim. Although the drinks were the biggest disappointment, it was probably my saving grace because I had work the next day. I still would've liked the choice to be risky or not. For dessert, I ordered the brownie and vanilla ice cream to share. It did the trick in size but I did expect more from the brownie. Lastly, I reached and exceeded my initial spending goal and took advantage of the Yelp Check-In for a free margarita. The entrees we're extremely good and made for good leftovers to warm up the next morning! A-OK!"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE:  there are so many great spots in LV, we probably won't be back.

Pros: The location is GREAT, vibe is so relaxed, hot waitresses, good music, optional outdoor seating.  The guests looked happy & the staff were busting their butts....(except the bartenders)

Cons:  we sat at th bar & got awful service which is weird bc they weren't busy.  This is a service based city, so waiting for silverware to eat ur food, not to mention a drink to wash it down (wtf) is not a huge request....

The cheeseburger was w/o cheese :( and th bun (while tasty) was a little cold.  The med rare burger had bled badly onto th bun, which is kinda gross... Overall the flavor of the burger was decent, though.  The fries were fine.  With better execution the meal would have been pretty good - - the bad service was the clencher in this case."}
{"text":"We were on the strip and we're starving so we stopped by Cabo Wabo for lunch. The wait wasn't long and were seated in a timely manner. The chips and salsa was so good. The chips were thick, warm and crispy. The chilled salsa was pur√©ed with some texture from the tomatoes and had enough kick from the peppers. For my main dish, I got the baja mahi mahi tacos which I was very disappointed in. The dish had zero flavor and I think it was cooked in a pan. The menu says it is grilled but i disagree. I was under the impression it would be grilled. My friend got the Chicken sabana which was greasy and so much going on with the pico de gallo, onions and chorizo over the flattened chicken breast. I would come back....only for the chips and salsa. The food is overpriced and not all that great."}
{"text":"Great food, delicious cocktails, and excellent customer service. Danny, our waiter, was attractive AND charming! He was so attentive, made us laugh, and hooked us up with free shots! What a sweetheart. If we could have cloned him, we would have. :)"}
{"text":"Despite the drinks, and the food we had a fantastic time here. Shawn Eiferman was playing guitar and had us in stitches. Not only is he a talented musician he is very quick and funny. We waited for the outdoor seating to enjoy some winter sun and the free entertainment."}
{"text":"Great place to people watch and enjoy the strip. Nothing like sipping a cold margarita and just absorbing the wonderfully tacky and bustling strip. The chips were great= hot and fresh. The salsa too smoky chipolte for me, but the BF loved it. Mediocre food and the service was a bit slow, as they are always slammed. We had a BOGOF coupon for a drink if we sat INSIDE and it isn't worth it. I would go back for HH and chips only."}
{"text":"Shrimp tacos were very, very good. I would have liked a little more spicy crema but overall, very good.
 The CW Margarita: OH MY!!! The best in town
We were little disappointed considering this is a Sammy Hagar establishment that the music was all rap and pop. Yeah, yeah, we are rockers and were hoping!!! 
Despite the slow service and music, we really enjoyed the food and more importantly, the margarita! Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Happy hour is the only time we ever go....I don't really see it being good for anything else. And if you're a girl expect terrible service."}
{"text":"Went here with a few friends from work and was expecting the typical chain type Tex Mex and was pleasantly surprised with the food quality. I had 3 soft chicken tacos with the rice and beans and they were really good. My 3 friends all enjoyed their meals as well, so chalk one up for Cab Wabo. Service was decent, we went for a late afternoon lunch and it wasn't crowded so we were waited on in a timely manner. Waitress was attentive but not overly friendly which is fine. As with all food on the strip, there isn't anything inexpensive anymore, this place is no exception. But overall I'd say give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place was clean and our server was good. The food was pretty good as well. I didn't give it five stars because nothing about it was memorable-it was good. I feel like we waited longer than we needed to wait for things like the boxes to go, and the check. But that's about the worst I can say. It is a great location for large parties as there were several bachelorette parties that were there. it's a big open space and they have a great outdoor area that's sat on Las Vegas Blvd. So you can watch all things Vegas moving up and down the Las Vegas strip"}
{"text":"We've only done drinks and appetizers twice here, but they have been great!! Yesterday chips, salsa and guacamole with margaritas and pina coladas. They were so good we are back today for the freshly made guacamole and all the can drink mimosas!!"}
{"text":"Ceasar and Erica are the best waiters ever!! For real. They went above and beyond to make sure our bachelorette party lunch was a success!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Friendly bartenders, great house margaritas and fantastic people watching. The queso is delicious as was the tequila lime shrimp. Great happy hour, great location. A must visit every time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Over priced and drinks are out of the machine and horrible! Servers appear to be on drugs! Guacamole is bland! They're only gonna make money from out of towners that don't know any better. Margaritaville has waaay better drinks and reasonable."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Mon-Thur 3-6pm

Happy hour specials aren't great.  $3 street tacos and beer and shot specials starting at $5.  I like cocktails and apps so this is not the happy hour for me.  We ended up ordering Shrimp Nachos, Maui Rocker, Sammy's Toasted Colada and Strawberita.  Food was good but they were nachos.  Kinda hard to mess up nachos.  Drinks were strong and tasted great.  We sat at the bar but they also have an outdoor patio.  Our bartender was nice, more so after she found out we were locals."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place five stars just for the nacho starters. They are a meal in itself, we split between two, and were more than satiated. They are one of the best you will have, ever! We sat at the bar and found the bar staff to be pleasant and attentive. Margaritas were just ok."}
{"text":"Eat at the bar great service great drinks. I loved the food I don't  get the negative reviews here   The food is fresh and good way better than any other like place in Vegas. I could come here over and over. My favorite bar and and grill in Vegas."}
{"text":"The band was amazing! Great cover songs and crowd interaction.
The queso was mediocre (and you have to pay for chips and salsa).
The portobello mushroom fajitas were fantastic!
Cocaritas had a great taste, but lacking in booze.
The service was decent for a busy night and the food came out FAST! 
Like, not even time to go wash my hands fast.
Shout out to Danny for being a great server and fixing our order after I had made a mistake!
Extra shout out to the hostess who when being asked, \"What's the difference between here and Las Salsas?\" said, \"This place is better and Las Salsas kind of sucks.\" (We walked by there on the way out and are very thankful for your advice!)

These are all things that should have at least guaranteed 4 stars, however, the margaritas were incredibly weak. I'm a light weight and did not feel anything! When paying $42 for a pitcher, I shouldn't be able to taste the sweet n sour mix over the tequila!"}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour and got right in. Margaritas were just right. Waitress was great. Got our tasty chips and salsa with shrimp. Atmosphere was filled with good music while we enjoyed the Bellagio fountain across the street."}
{"text":"I could not have been less impressed with this place.

We walked up to the hostess station inside only to be ignored by the hostess (and a second employee standing next to her) while she chatted on her walkie talkie with another employee.  Finally one of them said \"You wanna eat?\".  No, we randomly walk up to hostess stations all over the city without the intention of eating there.  I was ready to go but my friend had a groupon so he wanted to try it. 

We were then sent to the outside hostess station to be ignored by *4* more employees.  Seriously - how many employees do you need to stand around chatting with each other??  One girl even had her leg sprawled across the narrow entranceway to the outside seating.  The hostess went to seat us but didn't tell her to move her leg so she continued to chitchat and block the entrance while we waited.  I don't know who manages this place but he/she needs to get on the ball.

After being seated we were greated by our waiter (something Kennedy?) who was very nice but seemed to want to rush us.  

The drinks were served in plastic cups but I have to admit my drink was good (their version of a Long Island Iced Tea).  The prices are not that great (which we expected on the strip) and the food sucked.  It looked like it was going to be tasty but couldn't have been more bland.  There were no condiments offered and there was NOTHING on the table, even salt.

I would never go here again.  Its typical drunk-touron crap.  Bad food, bad employees, bad pricing."}
{"text":"The service was good and they were flexible letting us use the Yelp check in offer."}
{"text":"Great for a quick stop on the strip at the outdoor patio.  Food is as you expect, and get some slushy drinks to cool off that desert heat!

MUST HAVE: any slushy drink
MUST TRY: carnitas - the pork is like cotton candy the way it separates itself from itself before the fork even touches it."}
{"text":"I either tip 15% or 0, but this was a phenomenal experience. Our server Ron was beyond exceptional, to the point that i let the manager know how good he was. He didn't go over the top, just polite, attentive and available!!!!! After checking in through Yelp and discovering we got a \"free margarita\" ($8 house, not a $13 waborita) the manager went so far as to comp us 2 waboritas!!!!! Now mind you, we dropped $215 between the 7 of us, during a quick lunch, but i was extremely impressed with the quality of service here. Hats of to you Sammy!!!!"}
{"text":"Very pricy for the low quality food. For the prices they charge you would be better off going to a buffet. The drinks are expensive the burgers dry and way over priced. Waiters where nice but didn't do to much waiting and only showed up when it came to paying the bill."}
{"text":"Went there to get something to eat. 
Service was great but soup was not. 
Chicken tortilla soup. 
Cool place but do not eat the soup!"}
{"text":"$45 for two margaritas?  Never again. It was a mediocre margarita, at best. Get off of the strip for better food, drinks, and prices."}
{"text":"I had the Sammy shrimp and it was good. sit outside closest to the strip under a heat lamp and watch the craziness while you eat. Great entertainment."}
{"text":"I was expecting something more out of this place. The location in lake tahoe was fabulous, so why shouldn't I get the same food as there. Boy, was I wrong. Our fajitas came out well done ( bad move on taste and texture), when we explained to the manager that we'd had fabulous food at the other location... He was quick to inform me that the owners are not the same, and therefore the food wasn't the same. I don't think I will make this mistake again. He did offer to cook the fajitas to temperature, however, he made it seem like if you want meat that is still flavorful and juicy, you would need to request it. I also notice that the beef used was nit of the same high quality as the tahoe location. Tsk tsk . If you're reading this and want good food, this isn't the place."}
{"text":"It was mid-afternoon and this place was PACKED! We were seated quickly because we had a reservation but we saw many other folks waiting around the host(ess) stand. The outside portion of the restaurant doesn't take reservations.

I give props to our server who navigated the crowd, shouted over the noise, and adequately served our food. It took FOREVER and wasn't 100% accurate, but our hungry tummies let it slide.

I think that Cabo Wabo was kid friendly. There were kids there and they seemed to been well accommodated.

The food was okay but forgettable. We like Mexican food, but we had a hard time finding menu items that appealed to us. We split a salad and our friend got something else. Our salad had too much dressing but was tasty. We had this problem on the strip at many restaurants. It's hard to find health-conscious food."}
{"text":"My server danny was so awesome that i would give my wife to him ;) awesome service and schooled me in alcohol. Keep that guy 
The drinks are amazing that he recommends"}
{"text":"Super overpriced and not worth the amount of food you get. I ordered shrimp tacos and there were no joke 2 pieces of shrimp in each taco. The table next to us got some type of fajitas which didn't look too bad but still small. I'm not afraid to spend money at a restaurant but I would have rather dumped my cash into a slot machine than spend it on the pathetic amount of food they gave me."}
{"text":"O.k. -- so maybe the fifth star is a sentimental star...

I love Van Halen, Van Hagar, and Sammy Hagar -- so I am a fan of Cabo Wabo.  I also love tequila, and enjoy Sammy's signature Cabo Wabo tequila.  Every time we are in Vegas, we stop by Cabo Wabo for some tequila.

The best value is the flight of Cabo Wabo, which is 3 shots -- a blanco, a reposado, and an anjeo.  If you don't drink tequila, this is three different levels of aging, and a great way to start to understand the various grades.

We usually have some appetizers here too -- and they are all pretty good.  Prices are typically Vegas, of course.

Don't forget to check out the gift shop.  My flex-fit Cabo Wabo baseball cap is now of my favorite hats!"}
{"text":"Happy hour specials make it a great choice.  Really great guacamole and prices. Ordered meal and appetizers and both were great."}
{"text":"The food is a bit small for the price, but it is very good. Our waitress made sure we were well taken care of and even had a bit of fun with us. Drinks are a bit steep but they're also pretty stiff so I didn't mind.

Not a must do, but well worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Very cool place on the vegas strip. Went for memorial weekend and while waiting two drunk idiots were causing a scene so one of the waiters was trying to get him out and screamed for them to leave numerous times as they were not leaving. Once the idiots were out he apologized that we had to see that which i totally appreciated. After we got seated he was so nice to bring me and my friend a shot of a yummy drink and again he apologized that we had to witness the idiots being kicked out. Definately made my day and i really appreciated it! Thank you for the amazing service!!"}
{"text":"I probably love Cabo Wabo more than I should. I love getting a table overlooking the Strip and people watch. This is a prime area to watch the people in Vegas. 

They have some great frozen drinks, and their brunch is surprisingly good. There is usually live music as well which makes the atmosphere even more fun."}
{"text":"God this place was so dissapointing...where do i start? 

The waiter took forever to come over. I ordered fish tacos and my husband ordered tacos too...i cant remember which kind. 

They come out and they are fake flour tortillas! EWWW fish taco rule #1: USE CORN TORTILLAS!

I mean im from San Diego so we have a standard here especially when it comes to fish tacos. 

Their baja sauce-made me gag...i literally spit it out. The beans tasted like the canned victoria beans mixed with chorizo to spice it up, anotherwards gross. The rice was meh. I had to send it back and asked for nachos... which came out and had likt 8 green chips with cheese and chicken...the only good thing about it was the chicken. My husband grossed out on his food too. I was really dissapointed and will NEVER go back. These people should change their name cuz there was nothing cabo wabo about their food."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent excellent!

I ordered the Jalape√±o Chicken and it was absolutely amazing. Extremely flavorful and just tbe right amount of food

Our server Danny is excellent as well. Very friendly and he took the time to answer all of our questions thoroughly and in detail. I would definitely recommend this spot"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of spending the better part of an evening at the Cabo Wabo Cantina.  The bartender, waiters and support staff were very friendly.  I ate inside at the bar and the bartender, Nikki, made me a Waborita.  What was special about that, was that it wasn't on the drink menu.  Luckily I was wearing a shirt with the ingredients/recipe on the back.  It was fantastic.  I ordered the split Ceviche and although it looked like small portions, It actually filled me up.  A group of English tourists came in and asked about the Waborita and soon the were drinking them too.  I guess the point is that the bartender was very willing to accommodate a non-menu item in the middle of a busy day.  My guess is that she won't ever forget how to make them.  

The reason I'm writing this review is because I have been to the Cabo Wabo Cantina in Cabo San Lucas, MX.  I came in expecting a certain vibe and wasn't disappointed.  I wasn't there too long before an authentic Mexican Mariachi band showed up and the place got a little more lively.  All of the servers seemed to be having fun and from my perspective at the bar, the patrons were all having a great time too.  I can't comment on food I didn't eat, but I didn't see anyone complaining or sending items back.  It is a fun place to go if you have some time!"}
{"text":"Okay, the 5 stars is for one thing: THE COCONUT MARGARITA!!!!!  I love coconut and tequila but never had the two together until I came here.  A friend told me about it and it was on my \"must do\" list once I arrived.  It was well worth the anticipation.  FYI - there's a little place inside also called Cabo Wabo.  They do not have it there.  Go outside and to the right to find this place."}
{"text":"This place was sooo good. I came here a couple of months ago with my boyfriend and his cousin. And omg, so glad we did. It was busy, fun, and exciting. They also had like a live band playing right next to us; we sat outside. Our server was super nice and super attentive. I saw that he was busy and going back and forth with his drinks and orders but whenever we needed anything, he was right on it. It's been a while since I've been here, but I will definitely be back and hopefully be satisfied just like this first time. :)"}
{"text":"Great food. Very straightforward and good for groups and families. Plus I'm always down to support the Red Rocker."}
{"text":"This is the first place we went to when arriving to Vegas... it was soo hot and we just kept seeing people walking around with large daiquiris in their hands. Mind you this review is only for the daiquiri .... But with all honesty I forgot what i had LOL... (but it was good... ) they had about four flavors and all i know we mixed them all up.... it was under 30 dollars and if you keep the large cup you get $20 refills
Cant go wrong with that"}
{"text":"My friend found a hair in his food. Definitely lost my appetite when he pulled it out of his mouth. They compted his meal and drink and gave him a free double. We're  probably not coming back, the food wasnt that good."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for OK Mexican food this place isn't bad.  It's a little pricey in my opinion.  They do karaoke and were happy to let my 4 year old have a go at it. 
If you're really feeling good try their competition nachos.  You and up to 3 friends have 55 minutes to eat all 8 pounds of nachos, and it's free, otherwise you pay fifty something dollars.  We did it in less than 20 minutes and asked for more chips.  It was a great time."}
{"text":"If you walk the strip without eating long enough, and work up enough hunger, anything will taste good, but I truly believe we would have been exceedingly happy with anything we ate here even if we'd been less famished than we felt when we walked in to Cabo Wabo.
My date and I ducked in on a windy Vegas night and got a table with with no wait, shortly thereafter receiving the Queso Fundido con Chorizo (literally translated \"melted cheese with sausage,\" which is literally what we received) appetizer.  This was fantastic, and we scoured the skillet with our tortillas for every granule of meat and cheese we could.  On the server's recommendation I ordered the Cilantro Jalapeno Chicken entr√©e, which was an excellently-served chicken breast with a spicy sauce and onion straws on a bed of vegetable hash.  I was very pleased with the textures in particular, and the vegetables specifically (alas that I was too full to finish them).
Unfortunately our seats were not very good.  We were at the table closest to the door to the patio on a very windy night, with a poor view of the football games on TV.  Also, our server was quite busy and we didn't get a lot of attention from her.  All told, it was a good time and we were both happy with having come here for a late dinner."}
{"text":"On the positive side, this place has a great view, so if you're coming here, I recommend getting a seat overlooking the fountains and ordering beer and some shots.

The food is not good... we had an overly greasy torta and some very bad basic mexican dishes."}
{"text":"Food was decent.  Not incredible, but decent.  We were there for eats during a bachelor party week.  It took four times to request doing something cool for the bachelors.  They were supposed to do a bar top dance and pour tequila into their mouths but instead got watermelon shots that were supposedly on the house.  Overall we were looking for something cooler but it was  adequate.  I'd relate it to the hard rock.  Cool atmosphere with potential but only moderate tasting food with average service."}
{"text":"Loved Cabo Wabo.  Great location right on the strip next to my usual hotel \"Paris\".  Sat on the patio under the misters and chowed down great chicken fajitas."}
{"text":"Horrible, they nickle and dime you for everything. This is the first \"Mexican\" place that charges you for chips and salsa! Even just salsa they will charge you. Incredible, they need to learn from El Torito, where you can get not only pico de gallo but more creative salsas on the house. I asked to complain to the manager and nobody showed up. They don't deserve any business."}
{"text":"Looks like any other Mexican cantina....but once you go inside it a cool vibe and they have a twist on their meals. Great food great taste and delicious combinations"}
{"text":"Service was slow, had to \"borrow\" silverware from the empty table next to us because the waiter was nowhere to be found. The drinks were overpriced. The Margaritas were good however $12 for a Margarita in a plastic cup at a restaurant seems outrageous. The atmosphere was much like a Hard Rock cafe. With that being said, the food was good."}
{"text":"Service here is rock star, thanks Sammy!

After taking our lives in our hands by crossing the \"race track\" they call the strip, eight of us bumbled in around 9AM (we were across the street at the Bellagio). Just like true Las Vegas tourists we began our day with Bloody Mary's, Mimosa's, French toast and Jimmy Buffet on the speakers. 

Is it a tourist trap? Sure, but if I have to be trapped somewhere this works. The food is hot, the girls are eye candy and the booze concoctions are inventive. The outside bar overlooks the strip and people watching is an absolute trip. Watching the bums harass the overworked hookers and the hookers flashing the \"Jesus Saves\" advocates is priceless! 

Oh, the food, it's not fine dining, if you're expecting that you'll be sorely disappointed. If you're looking for decent vittles priced as expected you'll be fine.  Burritos and burgers....What else what would you expect? They actually have a good breakfast selection too. 

We're really easy to please/fun travelers- very respectful to the people who bust their ass for us. The staff was amazing - really some of the best service I received on my trip - they should be proud of that."}
{"text":"This is a great example of quality.  Showed up during happy hour, server (Jessica) reminded me of the deals for happy hour to maximize food versus cost.  Added benefit, food was  absolutely phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! We bought two appetizers and one margarita (all of which were very subpar) and left $60 in cash on the table. After leaving we were chased down, and my husband confused about what was going on went back and paid again. When he caught up with me in the casino and realized I had definitely left cash we went back to speak with a manager. The manager was rude and allowed our waitress to yell at us and falsely accuse us of not paying. He told us they were checking to see if they could find the cash - but after 20 minutes of waiting we finally left. I am EXTREMELY upset and will never eat here again. I will also tell everyone I know and anyone who will listen to stay away from Cabo Wabo. So unprofessional!"}
{"text":"Great food ambiance and service. Plus delicious tequila. Patio with heaters. Had some great photos taken here as well! Close to Caesar's palace so you can eat before a show   Delish salad wit thinly pounded and seasoned chicken!"}
{"text":"No alcohol in their margaritas. I order a pitcher of their coconut and tamarind margarita . I dint even get a buzz"}
{"text":"Omg this place was soo good! 

I ordered  the salsa and chips with a steak  queasadilla. 

The chips tasted freshly made the salsa had a good roasted flavor.
 
my queasadilla tasted so authentic like someones mexican grandmother was in the kitchen cooking a receipe passed down from generations.

I also ordered  a strawberry magarita that was awesome not too strong but had a kick."}
{"text":"Being from Houston, this food wasn't gonna compare.  But I was hungry and had at least heard good things about their breakfasts.  Unfortunately we went there for late dinner.

Tried to enter through mall and girl told us indoor was closing -- that we had to eat outside and to go around the other way.  So we went the other way and the girls there were like, \"Inside or outside?\"  I should've just said in but blah blah'd out, \"Other girl said inside was closed.\"  After confused looks from two hostesses at outside entrance, they said, \"Well, I guess if she said so ...\" and they seated us outdoors.

I had fajitas.  Again, not very good compared to Tex Mex we have here in Houston.  Girlfiend had some shrimp deal (I think the ceviche app) and it was just OK, too.

What really rubbed me the wrong way was I went inside to go to the restroom about 15 minutes after we got there ... and I see the same hostess who told us we couldn't sit inside seating a party of five.  I asked her about it and she just gave me a dirty look.

Guy playing guitar and singing at least was decent.  And our waitress was nice enough ... though we didn't see her that often."}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang out while the shoppers get their mall on.  These guys make a hell of a michelada.  Smoked salt on the rim!  I have also been working my way slowly through the menu and can report more hits than misses.  Sammy's shrimp is a good one as is the chicken sabana."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a group of friends before going to Britney's show. The inside area takes reservations, so we were seated promptly. Entrance is inside across from Sephora - not outside. 

We ordered the margarita pitcher for all - served like 5-6 glasses for $34.. not a bad deal!! I had the Pork carnitas tacos (3) which were so good. They had a bit of a spicy kick to them!! Music was great and the crowd was singing along to the popular songs. A great atmosphere for a pre-night out on the strip."}
{"text":"Yelp!! Where do i start? Yesterday 7/29 we were walking the strip and came upon Cabo Wabo. Now my Husband is more of a David Lee Roth kind of guy but we decided to check the place out. 
We sat outside but there were no misters where we sat down at so we decided to move in because we were already too hot. Soo we asked the host if its ok we move inside. She walked us in and put us at our new table... WELL this is where it all started our server was SO bad. He had no personality it was like talking to the wall... We sat there for over 8 minutes before he even came to the table. There was only 3 other tables inside at the time so it's not like they were busy.  This guy didn't even ask us if we wanted refills and let me tell you we can drink some tequila.

 We ordered our food which i asked for no pico because it's nasty and i hate it and well of course it had it on there. But i am not the one to complain so i pushed it off to the side and ate what i could. The one drink we had was good and the food was good but the service was not good at all. Right as we r done eating the busser came and cleaned out plates which he was so sweet he should have been our server. 
Before we are about to leave we are looking around at the table, this place as so much Sammy stuff to look at. A lady came over to the table and asked us how we were doing and if we enjoyed everything now i didn't tell her that our service SUCKED but i did tell her that our food had Pico and etc. She was so nice and tried to get us something else to eat because i barley ate my food. We asked about the upstairs and she took us up there to look around which i might say the view is amazing. She showed us around the rest of the cantina and told us a lot about Sammy that we didn't know. She brought us to the retail store which we had no idea there was on and was not sure if we were going to get anything again my hubby likes David. She gave us her card and said next time we come in to say hi. She made us feel like we were VIP. But every one there was SO nice but this guy with the red hat SUCKS. I can't remember his name i think it was Jason but who know i guess it's not important. Ask for Kristen when you stop by she will make u feel at home there.. So for her, the busser and the ONE good drink we had i will give his place 4 stars"}
{"text":"This was a nice little pit stop for us on our way down the strip. We knew we had dinner reservations in an hour, but we were starving and stopped in for a drink and some chips and salsa. Yes, that's all we wanted...but let me tell you, the salsa was freaking delightful. The waiter was pretty nice, especially considering we were only ordering chips and salsa for food! They have great drinks, prices are decent, (I mean you are in Vegas), and again the service was pretty good too. We would for sure stop in again :)"}
{"text":"Horrible expensive greasy food. Came here before Britney because it was in planet Hollywood and super disappointed.  I felt sick the majority of the night from the food.  Additionally, there was literally only one vegetarian option on the whole menu which is surprising for a Mexican joint..where were the cheese enchiladas on the menu?! Anyway, maybe I'm spoiled by good Mexican food in Texas, but cabo wabo needs to step up their game!"}
{"text":"I have tried to avoid Cabo Wabo Las Vegas the past six years because it looks like a giant tourist trap from the outside. Well, I finally caved in one day because I was starving for food and service attention especially after my dinner disaster at HEXX. 

From the hostesses, to the waitress to the busboys, everything was excellent. The staff members here are full of energy and provided our table with great service. I ordered the Cotija cheese crusted quesadilla w/ chicken and requested 2x rice, instead of the beans. I was surprised by how good it tasted. There was plenty of chicken and filling inside the quesadillas. The tortillas were grilled perfectly, with a great crispy texture. For the $15.95 price tag, it was a great deal considering we are in Vegas. My buddy ordered the burrito and enjoyed his food too. The only qualm I had was with the fountain Coca-Cola beverage I ordered. It was extremely watered down and lacked carbonation. 

Cabo Wabo Cantina, you did not disappoint me!"}
{"text":"The staff was so nice! If the outside is crowded try going to the indoor entrance in the Miracle Mile. We apparently had an old check in for a free margarita but since we couldn't redeem it, we received a free round of shots for the entire party of 11! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the sleazy tactics used by the waiter. We had a few hours before catching our flight home. We wanted an outdoor venue. They do have a nice location right on the strip but slightly elevated. I looked at the menu and order the Shrimp Taco's. The waiter decided that I would like the Sammy Shrimp better. When he brought it out, I asked him where my taco's were. He said, \"I thought you might like this better.\"
Everyone else had their food and we had a flight to catch so I said \"whatever\". It wasn't that good but it was food. 
When I got the bill, he charged me for Shrimp and not the tacos. The Shrimp is the most expensive plate on the menu. I said no way, I didn't order that. I said bill me for what I ordered. 
He went to check with the manager and came back and said she said no. He then trys to play the guilt trip on me by saying he will take it out of his own pocket. That may work on some people. I said I will talk to the manager. He stopped me and said he would ask again. He came back and offered to take $5 off. I know this is a scam that they use to increase average bill. They may even get bonuses for selling the most expensive items. Sad."}
{"text":"WORST service. The hostesses quoted me 20 minutes three times, FINALLY we were seated and had to sit at a tiny table where we had NO room for our food, and we had to listen to rock music at a MEXICAN restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow. Six tacos, rice and beans, chips and queso and to soft drinks = $78.00 for two people. If the food was good, I would somewhat understand. Chips and queso were good. Shrimp tacos had no sauce. Shrimp was out of a box. No flavor. Carnita tacos were too spicy. Not much flavor. And then charge me $5 each for a Coke. I'm not going back"}
{"text":"I came here with some coworkers while visiting Vegas for work. Our server was extremely attentive and we had a great overall experience. Their happy hour is awesome! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Had reservations and we were greeted with smiles. I was with a very large party and I don't think the waitress completely catered to our table. The atmosphere is cool but it is very very loud! There are Tv's everywhere and music playing. The food was ok the prices were ok as well. It was just an ok experience!"}
{"text":"Food was ok,  4 stars to that,need more habanero in their \"macho\" sauce and need to pick a better fish for the fish tacos, cheese dip had a great flavor and I know about rice and beens and they know what they are doing there,  but boy, my server BRONSON had such a great personality knowledgeable of their menu and very helpfull, found my self negotiating in a few situations wich is funny because this dude is a good salesman, looks like cabo wabo knows how to pick their staff, margarita not too sweet and well made, ill give 5 stars to margarita even tho a little pricey, but hey! we are in the middle of vegas strip right?  Cant wait to come back when the weather os a little warmer."}
{"text":"We eat here every time when we came to Vegas, food is good and services is nice, ordered Sammy shrimp with dirty rice all the time."}
{"text":"Shane made the best mango picante Ever!!!!!!! Thank you will come back for sure!! Will be looking for him next time"}
{"text":"I'm not sure about their dinner but I'm convinced that like their breakfast it's delicious.Me,my mom,and sister wanted to grab a satisfying morning meal and we found ourselves at this inviting facility and all of the food we had ordered was cooked to perfection and was quite delightful I recommend this place to anyone who wants to satisfy those good breakfast cravings."}
{"text":"Location is awesome, great view & great people watching on the strip.  But that's where the positive ends.  Don't go here for the food.  Even after not eating all day and being drunk and starving, the food was still horrible - bland, dry, just overall bad (got the chicken burrito per the waitress's recommendation).  

I would only go back for drinks on the patio... take your money elsewhere if you actually want to eat good food."}
{"text":"Ask about their Yelp check in about free margaritas! Nice breakfast spot to get the day started"}
{"text":"YOU'LL BE SORRY IF YOU DINE HERE.

I ended up at this beer joint because I was herded into it by a group of friends, who were starving and just wanted to sit down and eat.

THE FOOD: Is commercial at best and expensive. A better dinning experience can be had by buying a Swanson Mexican TV dinner and taking it to your room. To make things worse, the service was slow. The waitress acted bothered when someone from the party made a request.

THE BILL: They added an 18% gratuity and some other mystery charge
( check your receipt for it)  When my friend confronted the waitress about this other fee, she was told that all places in Vegas charge this fee. Well, we ate at many other restaurants and never saw that added charge anywhere; CROOKS.

Lastly, when we paid our bill, in cash, the waitress never brought our change? When my friend asked where our change was she said, \"We always keep the change.\" LOL! AS IF! 
We made her give us our change back. She reached into her apron pocket, grabbed an uncounted amount of coins and said, \"Here.\" (the rest of that was, \"Now go away!\")

Go to Mon Ami Gabi, if you want superior food and a classy dining experience; it is only down the street, in front of The Paris hotel, and less expensive!"}
{"text":"Betsy is the best server I've ever had EVER!!! And the Salsa Macho and Jalape√±o margarita rocked my world!"}
{"text":"\"Fun atmosphere, good cocktails, and yummy smothered burritos\". I've ate here twice I thought the fajitas and Corona would be the only thing I would come for, but I gave the smothered burrito a try, \"delicious and filling!\" I would also recommend this place to watch the games :-)"}
{"text":"I'm a year late in getting this in but better late than never. I had a group of 26 joining us and I called the location and they held a table for us. When we got there, the table was ready and the servers were ready. We had one that took one side of the table and one that took the other side. More friends joined us and they just added another table and never complained. The servers never complained about breaking up the checks and came around often to check on us. We had the games on (Football Season) and even though my Chargers were not a priority game for most, they made it a point to have it on just for me. 

The food was good and the drinks were delicious. I had a drink with coconut on the rim. Yum!

I recommend this location to anyone and everyone who wants to just check out the place or go and enjoy with a large party."}
{"text":"I am vegan and love this spot! We usually order a vegan burrito or vegan fajitas etc. I just have to be clear about not having any cheese/cream/lard/chicken stock etc. I am always disappointed with my drinks at other establishments because they rig the liquor, but I have never had an issue with my drinks at Cabo Wabo. Nice outdoor patio overlooking the strip, great chips 'n salsa, and tasty drinks! Yum!

Tip: We purchase 20% off coupons at the nearby kiosks for like $2 and usually get our photo taken while eating that comes with another 20% off coupon!"}
{"text":"I had a great time at Cabo Wabo Cantina. Our server Avi was great! He made sure we hade everything we needed. 
The food and margaritas were very good.
We sat out on the patio and had a very nice time."}
{"text":"Overpriced touristy destination. You're basically paying for the location, not the food. I wouldn't say it was bad or good, just overpriced. When getting the check, the waiter overcharged us for some drinks. He had to go into the back and change it twice after 5 minutes of explaining each time."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday to watch some football on our last day in Vegas. It was a pretty chill spot with lots of rooms for large groups. They have abut 12 TVs playing different games 

The service was great and the food was ok. I got the cheese crusted quesadilla and it was pretty much what you'd expect from a non authentic Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"What made the day at Cabo Wabo was our visit with Wendell!  He and my wife are cancer survivors that were able to share their stories of fighting cancer.  So inspiring to be open about everything going on in his and our lives.

This was not the only highlight, great beer and an excellent margarita.  Hearty appetizers to fill the void from our morning of exploration in Vegas.  We sat outside at the bar and glad we did, there was a reason for our meeting.

We were so surprised to be leaving and have Wendell meet us outside.  He had shared our story with his manager, very rewarding to know in such a short time we left an impression.  Wendell brought down some Cabo Wabo wrist bands supporting cancer awareness.

In all a great visit, we will be back on our next visit."}
{"text":"We just dined at Cabo Wabo. Patio seating is awesome because you can people watch while you dine. I love the vibe of the place & it's great location facing Bellagio. I ordered the fish & chip (16.95) & my companion ordered the chicken enchiladas (15.95).  The waiter asked if we want sour cream, & we said yes. The food was pretty good, but when the check came, they charged us $1 for the sour cream (you'd think it's free because it's a little dish of sour cream). On top of that, they charged a fee of CNF (2.15) which he explained it's a franchise fee. I've never heard of such a fee. So do you pay for a franchise fee at McDonald ? I don't think so. Also I understand they were busy, (but really not that busy; it's a Tuesday night) the service was really slow. Although it's not much money, I think the restaurant is really cheap to charge for sour cream & the CNF fees is ridiculous. Anyone here can explain what this CNF is???"}
{"text":"We went here because we found it on Groupon. The food is delicious, and the portions are so big! We ordered the guacamole and chips--couldn't finish it all because there was so much. The chicken sambana is probably one of the most delicious meals I've had. 4 stars because it can get quite pricey if you don't have a coupon. I get that it's Vegas, but still around $17 a person. Will go again."}
{"text":"I hosted an UYE at Cabo Wabo tonight, and I have to say the staff couldn't have been more helpful.

There ended up being about a dozen of us, and while the hostess earlier in the day told me that any groups over 6 couldn't be seated together on the Patio, but Roladno the manager made sure we had a place for the crew.

Donnie our waiter was one of the best I have had in a while, he took care of the entire crew and even took care of some minor issues we had.

I booked the UYE there because the las vegas advisor said they had $1 drafts from 9-11p, well when we got there they said it was just for the 4th, but after explaining to them that we have scheduled the event based on that happy hour, they decided to honor it for us. (thanks again guys for going above and beyond)

I personally didn't order anything off the menu (liquid dinner FTW), the few things I sampled were really good.

My only major complaint was that the misters on one of the umbrellas was broken so only about 1/4 of the group had misters, but that is about the only complaint I have.

I would recommend the place, the food is decent, the drinks are good (bonus we got free Cabo Wabo shots at the bar during a Hagar Song), and the staff will go the extra mile, on the strip you can easily do worse, but it's hard to find better"}
{"text":"We sat right away for a party of 3. The server was attentive considering we went on Spring Break and the place was packed for breakfast. The have great patio seating so you can people watch. Can't mess eggs and toast up too much. Also had the chicken chiliquiles over fried tortillas with an over easy egg on top with melted cheese with a mild.sauce. That was good."}
{"text":"I sat on the deck and had an obstructed view of bellagio's fountain. There is mist for cooling off, and heating lamps (I guess for when it gets cold at night?) They play pop music on a loop through the speakers, which adds to the fun atmosphere. Food and drinks are on the pricey side, for what it is (which is why I gave it 3 stars). I had an app and one drink and the bill came to $25."}
{"text":"went here with a few friends from out of town. came during happy hour and wasn't impressed. slow service. hardly any smiles. not so great margaritas. they were actually pretty bland. not strong, but not even sweet. something was off with them. didn't try much of the food but the unlimited chips and salsa were alright. a little too salty on some chips, but eh, better than the drinks.
i'd be willing to give it a 2nd chance because i had some friends that said they enjoyed it. maybe i got them on an off day, but they weren't even busy."}
{"text":"If you gona eat Mexican food on the strip. Eat at Diablos at Monte Carlo. More reasonable"}
{"text":"Awesome food and the service was amazing. Usually in Vegas you get one or the other I feel like and generally it's overpriced. I feel this place has a good balance. The food may be slightly higher in price but what do you expect YOUR IN VEGAS!! 

But if you are going to go eat and not spend thousands this is the place!!"}
{"text":"As my girlfriend and I entered Cabo Wabo, we spotted a cute, quiet table we interested in sitting at. As we were making our way over to the table, we were stopped by the hostess. 

Hostess: \"Are you ladies looking for the bar?\" 
Us: \"Actually, we wouldn't mind sitting at that table over there...\"
Hostess: \"No, the bar is over that way.\"

And then we were escorted to the bar... which was full of low-lifes and drunken dudes. The smell was awful, the people were awful, the servers were awful. It felt like we were attending a \"dudes fart party\"

Why were we escorted to the bar? Why were we denied a table?
These questions will never be answered. 
We were assumed trash.

This place is nasty."}
{"text":"Cabo Wabo locations every where are excellent. Food is always consistent & service good. Excellent drinks & music. We are huge Redheads so always make sure we stop at one of Sammy's places !"}
{"text":"Yikes. We came here for breakfast one morning and man did we regret it. The worst service I've ever experienced and the worst food. Everything was very greasy... Actually, greasy is the wrong word... It was oily. Very oily. Ew. 

We had basic eggs, bacon, toast and hashbrowns which I thought was hard to screw up but somehow they went above and beyond. Took an entire napkin to soak up the oil from my easy over eggs. My friend had the scrambled eggs which were clearly scooped from a bucket of pre-made, and gooey, eggs. Makes me shudder to think of it.

The service was brutal. She forgot to bring us knives and forks, then forgot salt and pepper, and the ketchup and then she sat in the corner giggling with the rest of the staff until we finally asked someone else. What a joke.

Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Seriously underwhelmed.  Great location on the strip but goes downhill fast.  Bad margaritas.  Very bland food.  Overpriced because of the location.  With all the Vegas food options, avoid this place."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes on a Monday night for a table on the patio for 7 people. I can't imagine what the wait is on a weekend night. We were able to get some drinks and sit at the bar while we waited for our table, but it still took foreeeverrrr. The frozen margarita I got was a little too sweet and gave me a headache so I barely drank half of it :( As for food, I got the carne asada tacos which comes with 3 tacos and rice and beans. The carne asada was sooooo salty and the beans were not good. Definitely not worth the ~$15 cost. I would rather have Del Taco!"}
{"text":"Come here for quick drinks and food, I guess. Other than that it really shouldn't be a top pick for anyone. My girls and I only came here cuz we wanted Mexican food. The food wasn't anything special but we liked the appetizer of the nachos. Something that I didn't appreciate was not being notified that Ranch was an extra $1."}
{"text":"Yes, to the Waborita's, Yes to the ambience, food and fun, and YES, to \"YESinia\" the best server, greeter and organizer and rest assured assurer as it gets. We had an accidently cracked glass from a few weeks previous and she greeted us back, intro'd us to the staff, the Loft (hope to invest in that party some day) and enjoyed my time there so much...had to look down to see if my feet was in the sand. Hope you all see our fab foto as this pic is worth 1000 words. sorry it took 4ever and a day to post but...with memories this clear and solid...it also last 4ever. Thanks guys and see you soon . . . -=Run, dont walk...to this location. -chris & joy"}
{"text":"For Mexican food it's pricey and the quality was not great. Most Mexican restaurants chips and salsa is standard complementary but not here it was only 4 bucks but still you get a bucket of chips and small saucer of salsa no bueno. The beer was good the margaritas not good at all didn't taste like a strawberry one was too sweet and didn't taste the alcohol. Probably best to go during happy hour for cheaper. Steak fajitas were awful the meat was rare and cut way too thick. The rest of the meal nachos wasn't great either they use some type of cheese whiz instead of real cheese wasn't good at all. Overall the total meal for two people was over priced for the quality of food. I would probably not return."}
{"text":"Came here with adult family on a late Friday night (around midnight, Jan. 20th) to celebrate a birthday. We sat outside because a band was playing and it was kind of loud. Our server was helpful & pleasant, the food was fine, but it was the bus boys and clean-up staff that made this experience a total turn-off and will not make me recommend this place to anyone...

On weekends the place suppose to close at 1:00 am, but for whatever reasons the bus boys, started coming around and asking are you done yet repeatedly etc..additionally, they went as far as turn off the heating lights on the outdoor umbrellas and the heaters. If you told us, we need to close the outside area and if you mind sitting inside, that wouldn't have been a problem. But, by throwing these subtle hints and not being professional about is a huge turn-off for my family and I. Message heard loud clear...you don't want our business and believe me  will not be back."}
{"text":"A great, fun evening. Ashley is an awesome bartender! The lobster enchiladas are awesome."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular. Watch for hidden charges like $15 for a non alcoholic lemonade! (\" but you get the glass as a souvenir!\") mostly greasy food. Nice view of the strip, though."}
{"text":"very good - and well priced for Las Vegas. Located in Planet Hollywood its got a real nice view of the Bellagio fountains from the outside deck.  I discovered it via Groupon and if you checkin on Yelp while you're at the bar FREE Margarita.

I hope this spot sticks"}
{"text":"Stopped in to have a drink and appetizer. We ordered chips and salsa and some wings. The wings were pretty tasty but sadly the chips were bits and pieces. I could understand if they were free but they were not free and should not have been served. Clearly servers don't care!! Too bad!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved Cabo Wabo!! Chips and salsa were great! Queso was to die for and so were my enchiladas! All of us loved our food! Best Mexican food that I've had in a while! Good food and good vibes!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of people while we were in Vegas because I had heard nothing but great things about it. I'm not one to complain BUT our visit was a horrible. First off, our waitress was a bitch. I'm sure she's not always like that (I understand sometimes people have an off day)  but her service was just horrible. I ordered the nachos, they were nachos, lots of cheese, sour cream, guacamole, tomatoes, a bunch of little hairs, and onions. Yes, I said hairs...not only one but a bunch. DISGUSTING! I quickly called over our waitress and asked if I could speak to her manager. (With attitude) she asked me what was wrong and I pointed out the hair to her. When the manager came up to me he seemed shocked that there was hair and repeatedly told me that all his cooks are in hair nets and properly groomed. He then offered me a free drink and asked if I wanted another order of nachos. I said no thank you to the food but I'll take the drink. (The margaritas are gross btw) then as my friends continued to eat their food, my friend finds a hair in her tacos. YES MORE HAIR....by now we're disgusted and just want to leave this place. We will never come back here!"}
{"text":"I have to say..this place is not all that great. Its actually not even good. It straddles the fine line between mediocre and bad.

On a recent Vegas trip, my fiance and i decided not to go too crazy blowing our money at clubs so we sat on the outdoor patio overlooking Vegas Blvd instead ordering the half-yard margarita, beer, and some appetizers. the half-yard marg was on the rocks and was strong. I had a pint of Dos Equis Lager. We ordered the chicken strips and fries. Within 15 mins, i had a terrible stomach ache and ran to the bathroom to puke. It could have been something in the food or alcohol. But its one incident and it could have happened to anyone.

Why the 2 stars? I asked for another beer and it never came...but it was noted on our final bill. The half-yard came out to be $36!! when you order the same drink at the walk-through counter inside the mall, its only $17!! I tried arguing with the server but was so sick and nauseous that i couldnt. She did remove the extra beer charge and the bill was still $60!! 

i would not come back to this place to eat or drink. I would come back to watch all the drunk people attempt to walk up/down the stairs!"}
{"text":"Whatever Mexican food and crappy service.  Go find a million better restaurants on the strip.  They also charge for the chips and salsa.  This place will be gone within the year."}
{"text":"In general, I LOVE the Cabo brand.  I buy the tequila, I have oft visited their club in Cabo.  

Had a frozen drink from their walkup in Vegas on the strip, and a few minutes later had the dreaded gut rot feeling.  This is not what I would expect from them.  Frustrating that they obviously substituted a lower quality booze in there to cut costs.  Generally that is at the manager level with pressure from above.  I wont be back until the fix it.  These are not cheap drinks!  More than enough margin to serve actual Cabo Wabo or such."}
{"text":"Great location - across from the Bellagio. Fun music and good people watching. The 2nd Mai Tai was loaded with liquor and wasn't very good. Food was ok. Would rate this 3.5 stars and probably won't go back."}
{"text":"This place had good food. The portions were a very nice size. The location is great and the staff is friendly. They have misters on the patio that make it nice on hot summer days. It is a tad on the pricey side in my opinion. So beware."}
{"text":"Nothing special but not the worst place you could eat.

The manager and waiters were exceptionally nice and attentive.

While the furthest thing from being authentic Mexican, the food was tasty. 
The portions were good.

The place was super loud and full of obnoxious drunks but this is Vegas after all. 

I really wouldn't recommend this place for taking the family but if your looking for a quick dinner that tastes ok and will fill you up, Cabo Wabo Cantina is alright."}
{"text":"Great service from Ron by the bar! Thanks for the house margarita!!"}
{"text":"I actually really liked this bar. We went here for late night drinks after watching the fountain show at The Bellagio. Inside it was fairly crowded but not overly so we sat at the bar. I had a frozen margarita that was delicious and not too sugary or tart. The bar tender whose name I am forgetting was super cool and was pouring some good size shots - rare in sin city! The music was really good (we had been blasted with early 90's dance all day at the pool so were happy for some Foo Fighters, The Stones etc). At some point they give away free Tequila shots although that's not my thing. The misters were nice given the 105 degree heat. I'd definitely go back here!"}
{"text":"This place is in a great location for people watching.  We ordered the bottomless mimosas and our server was excellent!  There were not many people sitting outside, it was kinda cold, but Alberto and his side kick guy (didn't get his name)  were AWESOME! The loaded potatoes were pretty good, could have used more queso, but hey the service was amazing."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night drink. Well, late for anywhere outside the strip I suppose. The place was pretty empty at midnight and we got seated immediately. 

They have a bunch of options for their margaritas. I tried the cocorita which is their coconut flavored margarita on the rocks. I prefer them frozen but this one was surprisingly good!

They rim the glass with a coat of honey and roasted coconut slivers. It doesn't fall off easily so you need to gnaw it off. It's a great supplement to the drink. 

When we asked for the check, the waiter was able to split it even though we asked after the fact. Easy and done."}
{"text":"Having been here a couple of times, I can see where visiting Cabo Wabo at night could be downright annoying. It caters to the dudebros.

So why five stars?

Breakfast, my friend. It's the most important meal of the day, and Cabo Wabo had a damn good breakfast special. 2 eggs, bacon or sausage, potatoes, and toast usually sells for $9, but on my last trip it was on special for $4.99. Plus add a $4.99 bottomless mimosa special that lasted until 11, and the most important meal of the day gave me a happy happy buzz.

Consider that finding breakfast under $15 in a sit-down restaurant on the Strip is becoming difficult, this was a great discovery."}
{"text":"We just had a great breakfast at Cabo Wabo. I had the breakfast quesadilla and hubby had the Egg skillet. Both were very tasty. You can't beat the location for people watching on the patio. A shout out to Alberto and the hostess staff for fabulous service this morning. We felt very welcomed and all were very attentive. Great 1st stop on our vacay!"}
{"text":"We stopped in during happy hour and sat outside with a nice view of the strip. We had a great time. Our waiter was a lot of fun, the atmosphere was lively on the patio, the happy hour drink and food specials were nicely priced and our food was pretty good. Overall a fun place to hang out for the afternoon! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Stayed outside by the Strip and people-watched. Guessing where everyone is from and if it's their first  right time in Vegas is relaxing and entertaining somehow. Had a few drinks right under the heater, it was pretty chilly outside. They have different options for food, Mexican style mostly, nice loud music and all kinds of characters. Great spot to watch the Bellagio water show."}
{"text":"A nice moderately priced restaurant on the strip. The food was fine and variety was decent. I love eating outside and this is one of the few places you can do that. The vibe was fun and good tunes were playing. For a casual night out in Vegas, this isnt bad spot to stop for a while."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Cabo Wabo! I ordered my typical Mexican meal, a chicken burrito, and was pleasantly surprised. The food was fantastic! 

The staff was very friendly and the bathrooms are very clean. Prices are definitely reasonable for a nice restaurant on the strip. There was some live music playing which was really nice too.

We went on a Saturday night, and despite it being extreme busy, u still felt like we had space. 

Overall a great experience, I would definitely return here for another meal!"}
{"text":"All we were looking for was an outdoor patio to enjoy a drink or two before heading to the airport but unfortunately, we chose Cabo Wabo.  The outdoor patio is great but the service was pretty bad and the food was nothing special.  There was a sign by the hostess stand that said pitchers of beer for $15 - a steal in Vegas for sure!  We asked our waiter what beers qualified and he listed off a few decent Mexican beers so we took him up on the offer and ordered a pitcher of Dos XX Lager.  About 5 minutes later he came back and told us they were out of that one so we ordered the Tecate instead.  5 minutes more he came back and said all they had was Coors Light, WTF?? How do you advertise a special and not carry anything that's supposed to be on the special??  Someone must be terrible at ordering product or they just don't give a crap, not sure which.  Our waiter was really nice about it though and he was embarrassed as well so I can't place all of the blame on him.  We decided to go with margaritas and then some bottled Mexican beers to follow and when we got our check, we really wished that $15 beer special would have been available, such a rip off!  The chips and salsa were pretty lame and the taquitos were ok but my friend said her tacos were bad.  Overall, come for the beers specials and that's it...but make sure they're available first!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service by our waitress Yesenia out on the patio. The food, drinks and hospitality by everyone was amazing, thanks again. Ask for yesenia!"}
{"text":"The Cocoritas with the toasted coconut and agave is AMAZING! We actually ate here for two meals... once for a late lunch and once for brunch. Both were to die for and the setting is great! Awesome view of the strip while you sit outside under the shade or in the sun and people-watch. The Cabo Wabo Coffee is really great, too. I had the huevos rancheros for brunch and that was the best I've ever had.

Probably my favorite spot on the strip!"}
{"text":"We stopped  at Cabo Wabo to try it out since its Sammy Hagar's Joint. We were greeted  and seated by a very attractive Hostess. She left us with 2 menus.

15 minutes later our Server stopped by we ordered 2 Coronas while we perused the menu. 

When our Server returned with our drinks . We ordered the Carne Asada Nachos and the Steak and Shrimp Fajitas. 

The restaurant was decorated with some cool Rock Memorabilia from Sammy Hagar.

Our food arrived 20 minutes later.. The Nachos were good and it was a good size portion.

The Steak and Shrimp Fajitas were pretty tasty . But the portion size was lacking .

Cabo Wabo is also a little pricey. I paid by Discover Card and Rolled out."}
{"text":"We went here because we didn't want to stand in line for a buffet and we didn't have much time before the show we were going to. My wife and daughter enjoyed their blended margaritas. I didn't feel like Mexican food, so I ordered the BBQ bacon burger. It was a pretty good sized burger with really good fries. We sat on the heated patio and had a good view of the crowd walking below and of the Bellagio water show across the street."}
{"text":"I've been to Cabo Wabo twice & have enjoyed it both times. Is it overpriced? Yes, because it is mid-strip in a great location. The food is Tex-Mex & far from authentic, which is what I like about it. I'm more of a ground beef & cheese taco American taco girl than I am an onion & cilantro street taco girl. I think Cabo Wabo is more for the American taco lover. I had the chicken & carnitas fajitas, & they were good. The server was also good.  I was not disappointed. If you want a big bowl of cheese dip & a boisterous atmosphere, go here. If you want a glass of wine & a Porterhouse, keep on looking."}
{"text":"The food is pricey for the value. They give pretty small portions for a pretty hefty price. My food was good and my waitress was pretty nice, but you are really just paying to eat there because of its locations. I actually think the Bellagio Cafe has better food for the same price."}
{"text":"A small group of us came here on 5/17/13. We went here for breakfast and among the 5 of us we had everything from Huevos Rancheros, Chilaquiles,Micheladas, Pancakes, Los Huevos de Nacho and I had the Cabo Special Breakfast Platter. 

I tasted a bit of everyone's dish, (I was the belated celebrated birthday girl,) so I was taking advantage of my moment. All the dishes were tasty. The micheladas were decent. The bacon was perfectly crunchy. The pancakes were fluffy. The coffee was average. I really liked the potatoes in my dish, but the meat was NOT asada and I had asked for it well-done and got tough charcoal. 

Overall, for our first visit here, it was a good experience. Our server was really friendly, and attentive and went along with all our goofiness and antics. 

I give it three stars because it was just our first visit and I have not tasted anything from their lunch and dinner menus. but would return."}
{"text":"Great food. You have to pay some stupid fee for being on the strip don't understand it. complete rip off."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. The shrimp tacos were refreshing although I prefer unfried. The pork tacos are supposed to be spicy but werent! Wings were lightly crispy juicy and flavorful. Our server, Liz, was a delight!! Thank you for being a great server. Be sure to check in to receive a free house margarita!"}
{"text":"Nice place along the famous Strip. good view just in front the Bellagio . sadly the service is way too slow! pancakes were not so good. I complained but the waiter didn't care at all! anyway American breakfast was good."}
{"text":"I gotta say, Cesar rocked it. Super awesome, can't wait to come back! He made our dinner hilarious and awesome. And Jessica was so good! She made our dinner easy, fast and I'll just say it: Infinitely more enjoyable! Great time!"}
{"text":"Great food, hector our server was awesome and made the experience. Good music... Lots of throw backs, and they were able to sit a large group right away."}
{"text":"Stopped in here just for some drinks and apps as we'd already had dinner.  I had the Cabo Flight (3 sample tequila shots) and the Ahi Tuna Ceviche.  Service was prompt, good rock music (lotta Hagar of course).  No complaints."}
{"text":"When you spend the money to go to Vegas you have expectations. You expect for the most part that you going to have a good time. Your going to get some good service and that your going to eat some good food.. Its Vegas Right? Wrong!!!!!! Cabo Wabo is a Mexican Cantina right on the strip next to the Planet Hollywood. I went in there to grab some dinner and have few beers on my way to do a little gambling.. The place overlooks the strip so I thought it would be fun to sit outside and watch the action from the overlook. The bar was only about 60% full so I felt lucky to have beat the dinner rush. What Rush? you ask.. Exactly.... there was no rushing anywhere. The waiter took 20 minutes to acknowledge me. When he finally did I ordered a beer and the Cadillac nachos.. I sat there for another 10 minutes before the guy brought back the beer. He apologized for the wait and said he was just busy, but the truth is the whole bar was not busy and I watched him talking to other people doing whatever... and it was him that was not busy at all.. That by itself would not be enough to piss me off, but I waited another 25 minutes for the nachos and when they arrived they were the most pathetic greasy and poorly executed terribleness I have ever seen.. They were some kind of stuffed tortilla concoction with a dollop of sour cream and some guacamole. A real disappointing dish.. To make it worse I was out of beer. I tried a couple of the nachos but they were so shitty I just decided to cut my losses and leave. I paid the bill, $21.62 by the way for shit nachos and a beer and left.. If it was not bad enough that the food sucked and the service sucked. I had to endure an hour and a half of Sammy Hagar music.. For a Vegas strip venue this place does NOT Rock in any way shape or form. Cabo Wabo is a just skip it and go on to Hard Rock Cafe for me.."}
{"text":"Overall Experience:
The wait staff was inattentive and rude.  Our waitress was at the end of her shift and made several attempts to take plates while we had food in our mouths.  After she left, other servers kept coming over.  It felt like we were being rushed out, but we still took our time.

I am big fan of Tex-Mex and I really enjoyed the food.  I was looking forward to going here as I have a friend who raves about it.  Unfortunately, the service ruined the experience for me and I would not come back and I don't think I would recommend it to anyone beyond saying food is good, service is awful."}
{"text":"I was pretty stoked to check this place out, being a big Sammy Hagar fan, but I was pretty damn disappointed when it finally came to trying it out.

Dad and I went down for lunch, and we had a Groupon that was good for $30. We popped in around 12:30 PM, and it was already a difficulty just to find someone to seat us. There was no waitress around to seat us, so the hostess had us wait at the podium for a few minutes, and then she finally sat us herself. At this point, it was no biggie.

We sat down, and a waitress came up and took our drink order pretty quick...very friendly girl. She brought us some chips and salsa, which were pretty good.

I ordered the 4-item combo plate with a Carne Asada soft taco, a Chicken soft taco, a beef enchilada, and a chicken enchilada ($19) . Dad ordered Chicken nachos ($13). Let me just say, this is HIGHLY overpriced food. 

The food was brought out, and we marvelled at how little was actually on our plates. Dad's nachos consisted of eight chips with chicken and cheese centered around a scoop of guacamole. To make matters worse, they were extremely bland.

My food was more of the same disappointment. I had asked for my soft tacos with just meat and cheese only, and they were PILED with stuff. When I finally wiped everything off, the meat didn't even taste great at all. It was all extremely bland. The rice was okay, but the enchiladas were HORRIFIC. I've never tasted worse green sauce in my entire life.

Throughout the meal, there was this annoying bus boy who hovered around our table. Whenever we would pause in eating, he would run up to our table and ask if he could take our plate. He did this three or four times, and every time he seemed to get cockier. Let us eat our mediocre food in peace!!

After all was said and done, I'm glad we had a Groupon...though I wished I hadn't even spent the time eating there. Avoid!"}
{"text":"Plus: Chips and salsa were warm and plentiful, with a nice heat to the salsa. Jarritos soda was refreshing after an afternoon of drinking in the sun. Our waitress was also lovely and attentive. Hubby's salad was ok. 

Minus: BLAND, flavourless food. My rice seemed like they it had been sitting under a lamp, very dried out, and the beans were basically kindergarten paste. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I did not expect to like this place at all...I figured chain, similar to TGIF food quality. I started to be impressed with my drink - a mango pineapple mojito. Ummm...yum! Mango puree, muddled mint, and not too weak or too strong. The coconut margaritas were also a hit. My albondigas soup was outstanding. Everyone else loved their food - a mix of salads and seafood tacos. Our server worked hard to keep 7 indecisive women happy. OK, so a line dance broke out mid-meal...kinda corny, but consummate Vegas. The music is a bit loud (especially those Sammy songs) making it a tad hard to talk, but it's Vegas...who needs to talk?"}
{"text":"We liked it. Service was fast. Not crazy spicy. Chips fresh, salsa tasty. The margaritas will bite you quick. In and out as you please, on the strip seating to people watch and live singer."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner even though it has more of a bar vibe. Hey, it's Vegas. We ordered tortilla soup and nachos. We were excited when the bowls arrived with the tortilla shards, avocados and other add-ins in the center of an empty bowl. The soup was in a pitcher which the server poured around the add-ins.  We thought was a fun and unique way to serve it. The soup itself was very thick and brown - which wasn't at all what we expected, but we kept an open mind. It wasn't good. My sister doctored hers with sour cream and was able to eat about 1/2 of it. I had probably ten spoonfuls and couldn't eat any more. Ick.
The meat (beef) on the nachos had a weird flavor and was very strong. Neither of us liked it. The cheese was a runny queso-esque  concoction. The serving was generous, but we barely made a dent in them because they were not tasty.  The highlight of our visit was our adorable, friendly and attentive waitress Sarah Ma.  She was fantastic. If you want to get drunk and then eat, you most likely won't care that the food isn't good. If you want to party and drink, then this place would be great."}
{"text":"Everything tasted so good! Fajitas, green burrito, and chips were amazing. Also our waiter Kyle was the best, great service and hes the kind of guy you want to be best friends with."}
{"text":"Ate here on the weekend with a party of ten. Was kind of nervous because no where else would take us as walk ins. We waited a few minutes at bar while tables were being set up. We ate outside on the patio. The water show at the Bellagio was going on through out our dining experience so that was pretty amazing! The Margaritas were pretty good. We love rock and roll music so had a great time of enjoying the moment. The service was pretty good, could have been a little better, but realistically, on a Saturday night in Vegas when the house seems to be rocking, we have eaten at much worse places! One thing we liked is that our waiter asked if it was our first time dining here. Because we said yes, he went over menu and we listened to his recommendations. The guacamole and Sampler were awesome. 
When we left, the managers and hostesses said good bye(that is rare these days!).
We will be back next month, or next big boys night out!!!!!"}
{"text":"Even with a Groupon, my wife and I didn't think this place was that great... we came in for a late lunch and while their outside area seemed like the place to be, it was packed and it was 110 degrees out so we opted for the middle of their dining area. 

I forgot the name our server, but he had minimal personality and we only saw him once after he took our order and it was to give us our check. The food itself was okay, but definitely overpriced... $18 for 3 street-like asada tacos with beans and rice is kinda nuts... but hey, it is Vegas!

If the service would've been better, maybe I could've justified the food price, but it's hard to say... not sure that I would try again."}
{"text":"Boy, do I miss Trader Vic's.  We went back to the location because the outdoor seating is pretty great, thinking how bad could Cabo Wabo be?  I can almost give it 2 stars because the cadillac nachos we ordered were tasty, and almost worth the price (rare in vegas nowadays).  However, the margaritas were absolute crap.  I had the house, and my husband their \"house specialty\" of the evening - which claimed to be made with a reposado tequila, blue curacao, and grand marnier.  Mine was a teeny bit more drinkable than his, but was basically cheap sour mix in a 14oz. plastic cup filled to the 12oz. mark that didn't appear to have a lick of tequila in it.  C'mon people, I ordered this to actually enjoy the limey tequila flavor, not a gut-rot lime sour drink.  And yes, I did say this was slightly more drinkable than my husbands, cuz he had to finish mine.  And to top it off, those crappy 12oz margs cost us $15 each.  Un-freakin-believable."}
{"text":"Over $80 for a tiny table for two, next to the door leading to outdoor seating next to a pillar. So to avoid having constant traffic brushing passed me, I turned to face the pillar. The chicken tostada salad was good. I will say that. My bf burrito looked very pathetic. Came with a handful of scorched tortilla chips. We both tried the \"Can't Drive 55\". It was so sickeningly sweet, we didn't even finish them. We both regret that we didn't power through our hunger until we reached the south end of Las Vegas Blvd., where there are better dining choices. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Walked in to the bar and had a nice drink and GREAT guacamole.  Bartender gave great service.. overall - check it out!"}
{"text":"Food was good. We had the grilled chicken tacos. We ate outside and watched the fountains.   The pico was great, pass on salsa. I had a coconut margarita that was good, but was 26!$. My husband's drink was 28$!  Watch out. $$$. Buy the tic tonight deal before you go. Service was great."}
{"text":"I always love coming to Cabo Waco ! When in doubt order the street tacos to start off with . Drinks are so yummy . Wasn't a fan of the chicken taquitos but it's okay !"}
{"text":"Service is great and the food is good. Received my order in a timely manner. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Outside bar with bar food.  You can watch the water show from your table.  Decent music. The pitcher of margaritas very good.  Nachos were better than usual nachos."}
{"text":"Unless you are a complete Vegas drunk with no where else to go, well, I guess that's your spot. Loud, obnoxious and greasy. That is about the very best I can offer to this crowded, loud, very dirty spot. The food was microwaved, and greasy. I just won't go on, except avoid it."}
{"text":"AWESOME! The chips and salsa are delicious! Make sure you ask which one is hotter (spicy hot). I enjoyed my time here with my boyfriend. We sat in the patio by the strip, it is across the Bellagio, so we got to see the water show."}
{"text":"First off, their margaritas are top notch.  They offer them with many different tequilas and flavors.  Try the margarita if you happen to stop into Cabo Wabo.

Now that that is out of the ay, the rest of my experience underwhelmed.  I came for a party so the prices didn't bother me as much, but just looking through the menu, I noticed it was way over-priced.  Cabo Wabo has a good view of the strip so it's no surprise the prices are high, but the unnecessarily high prices will always knock off a star in my book.  We ordered appetizers, including chips, fajitas, quesadillas, and other sampler dishes for our party.  The food was actually very subpar - it seemed almost microwaved or cooked in a large batch.  If I were to spend a lot of money on food, I would want it cooked for me in particular, not just placed on my plate.

If you want a drink, come to Cabo Wabo.  I even believe they have a solid Happy Hour during the week.  But if you are looking for a sit-down meal, I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great sangarita. Friendly staff. The waiters will peddle expensive drinks on you if you aren't careful. We went late and they had someone playing acoustic guitar on the patio which was nice. They turn the heaters on if it gets too cold."}
{"text":"It's tasty, the guac is legit and the people watching is on point...over priced but hey, it's Vegas!"}
{"text":"Two because of the very average food. Nothing authentic about this place. Great view of street. Queso and chips were good. I had the fish tacos, which did not have much taste. My wife had the carnitas, which she said were ok. Large portions."}
{"text":"As soon as you enter this Cantina, you sense an upbeat and welcoming vibe.  The menu is varied and even offers gluten free blue chips.  The beer and wine selections are adequate for this type of establishment.  I was surprised to see that there were no items made with ground beef.  In addition, there were no black beans or refried beans; the only choice was pinto beans.  Our dining experience was even better due to the efforts of our server, Adam F.   Adam was helpful, attentive and personable.  His recommendations were right on target.  We enjoyed our experience at this particular restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the fish tacos and chicken nachos. Fish tacos with more cabbage than fish. Guacamole smelling a little stale. Not tooimpressed. Busy place thou. 
Cabo Wabo $20 novelty bottle margarita with no buzz. Give me my money back."}
{"text":"Service was horrible..food was ok. For such a great location so disappointed."}
{"text":"Cool place. good food. Great place to watch the world go by. If you get a seat outside, its cool to watch everyone. The salsa is awesome. they have a few to chose from. Tacos are great. Lots of good drinks to. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great music, atmosphere & patio. Overpriced food. Our server wasn't great.  Had to wait forever to get anything, like our bill, and the restaurant wasn't busy."}
{"text":"I hate to say it but I'm going to have to give it  an. ,,, A.. the Carnitas asada was cooked to Perfection the beans and rice were awesome guacamole with freshest not pre-made somewhere else and shipped in,,,, fresh avocados,, a very good mix salsa mild was awesome chips fresh not greasy good work staff will be coming back here!!!!!!
."}
{"text":"Very mediocre chain Mexican food. Ordered tacos that were super dry and then got charged for aioli.  Seats were uncomfortable and service was very average."}
{"text":"Delicious!   Today I had grilled shrimp tacos and substituted the rice and beans for the vegetable medley.  All of it was good, but the Vegetable medley was extra delicious since it was spicy Corn, zucchini, bell pepper and something else.   The pitcher of Cabo Wabo margarita was to die for."}
{"text":"What a rip off!  $50 for two drinks is absolutely ridiculous!   Will not ever return to this place!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the bar and drinks. We did not order food.

We were looking for a place to rest and relax after walking around and had some time to kill before Peepshow. Our bartender was Maggie and she was great. We had a couple beers and a Waborita, which was excellent! Prices were about what we expected.

I was a little turned off by our drinks being served in plastic cups but I guess that seems to be the norm in many places nowadays.

We did not order food but the fajitas that kept going by us being carried by servers every 10 minutes or so smelled AMAZING. We will try them next time for sure, as we had nothing but bad luck in the Mexican food department in Las Vegas.

A girl came up to us during our drinks and asked us to pose for a \"free\" photo, which she later brought back to us in a cardboard Cabo Wabo frame for only 15 dollars. Does not sound free to me! but we bought it because we liked the picture and we were enjoying ourselves. Why not remember the moment in a free photo that costs 15 bucks?"}
{"text":"We had been walking The Strip and were craving a sit down place that's family friendly.  Well the hostess said that Cabo Wabo was the perfect place for a family friendly dinner.  I didn't think that was probably the case since the word \"Cantina\" and alcohol mixing machines that flank the front of the restaurant don't exactly spell family friendly....HOWEVER, we were too hungry to care at that minute.  

Ambiance - We sat inside (strictly for the a/c)...we found out real quick that we couldn't hear each other talking since the music was so loud.  I normally don't mind that if I'm with the girls drinking, but I was with my family and it was just annoying.  We ended up having a meal that the conversation consisted of \"what?!\", \"what?!\", \"can't hear you!\", \"never mind, tell you when we leave.\"  We ate in silence after that.  

Food - The food was good.  We got cheese quesidillas that had tons of cheese in them.  Yay for the portobello fajitas!  Always nice for a vegetarian to see these on a tex-mex or mexican food menu.  They were very good.   We also ordered beans and rice which were good and a mojito that was very tasty, but had a few brown mint leaves in it which I took out before drinking.

Service - Service was friendly and the food came out quickly.  It slowed down a bit when we were trying to get a box and the bill, but that was since it had become very crowded and our waitress was slammed.

I would have given 3 stars, but since the music inside is so loud to where you can't have a conversation without shouting I gave it a 2 star rating."}
{"text":"Cabo wabo some of the most overpriced place Mexican restaurant
Very oily/ grease... and the rice and been seem TV dinners ... margaritas taste like concentrate syrup 
Sorry everyone to disappoint you! 

At least have a Great location"}
{"text":"I am sort of surprised by the negative reviews of this place. My husband and I are in our 20s and this was a great dinner for a night when we didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars.  We split the double order of fajitas for $30 which is and incredible price for vegas.  The patio is fun and lively.  If you sit along the outside bar, you can watch the fountains. They will refill your souvenir glasses for something like $12 which is also a good price.  The food was good and it was a great atmosphere. Obviously not a gourmet place, but that seems pretty obvious as you walk up..."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon deal after checking that this restaurant has 1000+ reviews but it wasn't worth the effort. A good location of course since it is on the Strip and has a good outdoor seating area. All this would have made sense if the food was enjoyable!

Didn't take much time to get us seated. We decided to sit on the outdoor patio because the view was good and that particular day was bright and sunny! Their music was really annoying. It was too loud. Apparently, that wasn't deliberate. Something was wrong with their music system and the volume was going up and down. Better to rather shut it off!

Margaritas were good. My husband bought Veggie Tacos which came with some beans and they were okay. I ordered Cotija-Crusted Cheese Quesadilla(with Chicken) which tasted good but was super-duper oily!! I don't mean to exaggerate but it was very oily and the oil was just dripping from the quesadilla. It had a side of beans and rice.

Not sure about the parking. We walked down from our hotel. Parking in Vegas, especially the strip is a bit cumbersome so it is better to take Uber/Lyft."}
{"text":"Have no idea what the food is like here, but I went up to the Cabo Wabo bar because I had spotted they had cheap margarita slushies to go. I'm not one of those people who wants to pay $20 for a drink in a souvenir cup (that I'll break or lose) so $5 for a drink sounds much better to me than $20. Of course the $5 drink special was only available for one flavour (mango), but I like mango, and it was a good deal. $5 for a boozey slushie to combat some of that Vegas heat? Yes, please."}
{"text":"The location for this place is awesome. You are right on the strip with the view of the cosmopolitan and other hotels. You have to order food in order to sit on the patio but if ya could just get an order of nachos. Great place to people watch and have a couple of beers."}
{"text":"This place wasnt terrible but it sure wasnt good.
I Ordered nachos and was completely dissatisfied.
The ceviche was actually good, tortilla soup was terrible, DONT get it.
Service was ok, not too friendly and the waitress came around maybe once or twice other than to take our order."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to stop by while in Vegas, and although he wasn't too crazy about the place, I absolutely loved their tacos. Not to mention their bread pudding is the BEST! I must admit the service was a bit slow, it was very crowded and they didn't have enough people. But oooh well, the food made-up for it! Will def. be stopping by again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Fun band playing in the background.  Nice outdoor Vegas experience."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow but the bottomless mimosas for $25 made up for that! Awesome food, great people watching, great atmosphere.  Sitting outside was lovely even if it was over 100! Plus the in house tequila makes for a killer margarita!"}
{"text":"Wow $13 for a strawberry lemonade that sucked. Glad I stopped there and didn't order food. But I got to keep the cheesy glass..."}
{"text":"Food was good but a little overpriced, especially drinks - $16 margaritas seem a little much to me. Guac was pretty good, it didn't taste home made or prepared daily but no guac is bad guac to me. Would go back!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other night. Husband had the fish and shrimp tacos. I had the cobb salad. Both were just ok. Nothing to write home about. It's very loud and dark in here. Not recommended for kids. The one thing that WAS fabulous, was the margaritas. Very tasty!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, great service. Thank you to our server, Morgan, who was awesome and attentive."}
{"text":"Ok, so me and my bf went here with a groupon. All i have to say is that i am sooooo glad it was with a groupon because if i had paid regular price i would have been upset.

Lets start off with, we got seated quickly. That was a good start, but from then on it went down hill. We got TERRIBLE service. We weren't the only ones either because i heard the people sitting around us commenting about the horrible service they were getting also. Finally when the waitress came around, we ordered the sampler platter and the signature margarita. The food was mediocre...you would think for the price is would be wow! but it was \"ehhh\". The drink also was nothing special for the price and for their \"signature\". We didn't bother ordering anything else because for us, it wasn't worth it.

To sum it up, i should have checked out yelp before buying the groupon, but oh well. You never really know until you try something for yourself. Anyways, I don't like this place and i wouldn't refer anyone to it either."}
{"text":"I'd give this a 3.5 but I suppose I'm rounding up for this review. The location is unbeatable. Right on the strip so you can people watch while eating, it's really nice. I'm from Texas so whenever I go to a Mexican restaurant I'm used to chips and salsa being free, so it kind of sucked you had to pay extra here. They were good regardless but nothing Jaliscos can't do better. We all three ordered tacos and they were all delicious, kind of street style like. The steak and chicken tacos were a bit dry so we'd put salsa on them. Fish tacos were really good. The waiter said their margaritas were famous so we ordered that. They were good but not sure how that can be called famous. I'd say go there for brunch or lunch if you're wanting to people watch or relax outside with good food. But don't expect anything life changing. It's the location that makes its great."}
{"text":"A rating on Yelp is just an average, and after 300 plus reviews I think 2&1/2 stars is a little harsh.  After Yelp filters some reviews its up to us to decipher  the reviews that are left.  I've noticed several bad reviews recently for Cabo Wabo's & I must say I am surprised.  

We arrived on a Thursday night & knew we would probably have to kill some time drinking while we waited for a seat, tough life I know.  We were pleasantly surprised when we were sat immediately at the outdoor bar over looking the strip with a clear view of the fountains shooting off across the street @ Bellagio.  When the wind blew just right we could feel  the mist from the fountains, which felt so good in the dry Vegas heat.  Cabo Wabo's was crazy packed but the bar back grabbed us some menus & took initiative getting us our first round of drinks (frozen margaritas & red bull vodkas) while we waited for our server to machete her way threw the weeds she was knee deep in.  It was a gorgeous night to catch up with my Pops & his wife who live here in Las Vegas & we could not have had a better time.   

I can't stress enough how if you go into a restaurant with a chip on your shoulder anticipating bad service your gonna have a shitty experience.  You live in and or you are visiting a great city to party and have fun.   Raise your glass, have a drink, do a shot.... and chill out!  I thought the the food came out in a reasonable time and had no complaints with my service.   The guacamole & chips were money, the chicken chimichangas were as good as it gets (especially after kicking back several margaritas).   I thought my fish tacos with beans & rice were the bomb & devoured every bite.   I was so happy I got my dad to to eat some Mexican fare that night it could not have gotten any better.  This was one bill I had no problem picking up & we will be back on our next visit to Las Vegas.

I know the reviews are mixed but I would roll the dice & check it out!"}
{"text":"fun atmosphere, great patio view, and the manager steve is a babe."}
{"text":"The location is perfect and the food is excellent!!! Oooo Dione the server was great!!!"}
{"text":"My husband a light house collector spotted the only light house on the Las Vegas Stip...we finally made it to  Cabo Waboc. yea us ..we stood waiting several mins for a \"hostess\" to greet and seat us while stood near by folding tee shirts..not even acknowledging our preasents I ask her if we needed to seat ourselves or would some one be with us...the hostess did finally appear and asked us if we like patio or inside seating....Port and I have been on an patio seating kick of late so we chose patio...thehostess the directed us to the just out side the mall doors there was some one there to seat us..we found a 2nd hostess who asked us again patio or inside ....we took the patio...and were led to a small table ..with no room betweem patrons I bumped the lady behind me 2 times..way over crowded..I be willing to wait to have my space..
the waitress was Very attentive and helpfull in ordering...forgeting to metion substutions are extra and add up fast..
Porter ordered a 2meat fajitas and substituted ries for rice and beans ..I got carni asada wet..we had chpis and salsa and guacamole ...
Porters meal cam with only 3 tortillas wraped together and stick together..but lots of meat .
my burrito had rice it it ..lots and lots of rice..hmmmm..the flaver was good and the meat i found was tender...the salsa was more a chhili sause and the chips we stale for the price of the guacamole I expexted it made at my table .well room was limited as was the space on out table ..
on the way out we noted theinside was empty ..just about...well with every one crowd ed on the patio thats why..."}
{"text":"Danny  B.is a great server!!! He was amazing and he helped with the selection of food. The skinny margarita for my date was on point!"}
{"text":"Had the worse waiter. Asked her what her favorite drink was she had none. We order a margarita, she split it correctly. But then I asked for a water, she said \"you don't need a water with that\" and never brought me a water. What a jerk,  I did not even order food because she did not want to give me a water."}
{"text":"Best wings ever, the mimosa deal is great and above all, the conversations were lively. 

Mrs. Tennessee (the nickname our group gave her) was a great host and can't wait for my next trip to trade barbs once again."}
{"text":"I love this place ! I highly recommend anyone to come here especially on a Sunday! There is live music here with someone name jack and he is incredible !!! Very sarcastic and entertaining ! The food was excellent ! Wonderful waiters! Will be here really soon!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a frequently visited spot for the boys when we make our annual Vegas trip.  Love the margaritas and the staff is always friendly and fun.  Have eaten breakfast lunch and dinner here at various times on different trips, never been disappointed.  It's a great location to sit, drink and watch the people walking the strip."}
{"text":"I'm not hard to please but this place was disappointing. I seen it the last time I was walking on the strip and it looked like a fun place with a good atmosphere. I'm back in Vegas and wanted to grab some food on the strip. I specifically looked for this place... We found out, got seated, ordered our drinks and waited on our waiter to take our order. That's pretty much how the rest of the night went. Just a lot of waiting. I ordered the quesadilla plate. The quesadilla was great but the beans and rice were horrible. No flavor, very very bland and so was the guacamole. Margaritas were alright, overpriced but I guess because you're eating on the strip, you gotta pay for it. The waiter finally brings the check and we got fed up with waiting for him to come pick up the money, we walked it up to the register at the front. The hostess started calling our waiter and saw he was at a table with 2 other waitresses flirting. Smh, then she says \"sorry he's too busy flirting\". Never again.."}
{"text":"Generally I won't write reviews for meh meals, and Cabo Wabo certainly qualified.  However they just added a new policy that earns them 1 yelp star, hidden pricing, yea deception.  They charge you a hidden \"CNF\" fee, which is nothing but bull.  If you want to charge more for you food, fine, go ahead and post it on the menu, don't try and hide it with some lame hidden fee.  Cabo Wabo deserves a full boycot for this sleezy tactic.  I will never patronize any establishment that uses hidden fees, and tell others to do the same.  Makes no sense, this is nothing but a another management fail."}
{"text":"Great location in the middle of the strip near Planet Hollywood. We were a huge group and had two large tables near each other. Staff is good but a bit slow. Regular chips and salsa and we added guacamole as well. We enjoyed the Ahi tuna ceviche with spicy tortillas and the baja shrimp ceviche. The Shortrib burrito was good and the fajitas were very ordinary. All and all we had a great time and food was good."}
{"text":"Yes! Great margaritas here!  Great for people watching too. The band was just getting started, but I'd say they were decent enough to enjoy an evening with. I'll check out the food next time. Service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Smells bad and service is bad nobody is coming and we left bcz nobody care the customer service"}
{"text":"After returning from a trip to Cabo San Lucas Mexico, I was still craving for the tacos (fish & carne asada tacos) from Cabo Wabo in Mexico.  So I decided to pop into the location on the Strip.  The location and atmosphere were great.  You can sit outside and overlook the Bellagio fountains and enjoy some great people-watching.  However the food was terrible, nothing at all like the Cabo Wabo in Mexico.  I was really hoping for at least something similar, but it was some of the worst Mexican food I've ever had. The menu was completely different too, and the only similarity was the name on the sign.  So, if you're going for a drink and simple appetizer, you will love the atmosphere.  However if you're expecting a good meal, you should eat somewhere else then come here for drinks."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and I gotta say I really like it. Service was good our server was very nice and fast. The food was very good I had the huevos rancheros they were perfect. We sat outside and the view was very nice for all this the price was very affordable. I will definitely be coming back again :)"}
{"text":"Only based for the UFC fight MCgregor vs Diaz.  We get here right before it started, to get in is 50$ per person. The TVS at the bar are bigger than the rest so hopefully they'll seat you around there. 

We got a pitcher of strawberry margarita for 44$ and wanted something to munch on so ordered the ahi tuna which was a little stack of tuna with 4 pieces chips for 15$.... When it first came out, my first reaction was.. Really? Gaaaahhh... But when I actually had a bite, it had a ton of flavors! I wished there was more, quantity wise, but life's not fair sometimes. 

Overall, I would go here if I happened to walk by and was hungry and didn't want to walk anymore."}
{"text":"Just plain bad all the way around. I had one of those giant fishbowl margarita's and it was way too overly sweet. not a good margarita at all.  I didn't even eat dinner there but tried some of my friends dishes.  The ceviche was a total rip off.  it was like $15 and it came with a tiny tiny portion like honestly its ridiculously how tiny the portion was.  come here for the atmosphere and nothing else.  Don't expect much for food quality here."}
{"text":"House margarita is served up.. which would be ok if they actually shook it to ice cold.. service slow and questionable. Food was ok, view from patio was great people watching."}
{"text":"While in Vegas this place is a must! Surprisingly enough for being on the strip, the food is amazing here! We tried a variety of plates and each and every one of them was amazing. The service was even better. Very impressed with the service we received from Yesenia and Deian! Their knowledge of the menu really made our experience so much better and the food really hit the spot! Thank u guys! Will definitely be coming back and asking for their service!"}
{"text":"Tourist trap.  Looks good but overall disappointing.  The tequila was great once we finally got it!  Food was mediocre and service was just plain bad!  
Do yourself a favor - skip the Cantina and brave the heat to Margaritaville at the Flamingo were you will be well served in a fun environment with great food and drinks!"}
{"text":"The food here is good.  I indulged in the steak fajitas.  Delicious and a healthy portion of steak to boot.  Get a table on the patio outside on a nice day and you have lots of people watching and an energetic atmosphere.  If it is really hot or the patio is full, get a table on the upper floor by the window.  This gives you a great view of this trip and the Bellagio fountains"}
{"text":"This is a great little outside cantina on the Vegas strip just steps outside of the the Miracle Mile Shops. 
It's in front of Planet Hollywood and next to Paris. 
Can't miss the huge sign! 
The outside patio is great. A mixture of tables and high tops and neat metal retro chairs. Large umbrellas keep the sun at bay but do t obstruct the people watching view of the strip. Chips and Salsa are a must for $3.95. mDelicious! I had the Crispy Beef Tacos with rice and my husband had the Fish and Chips. OMG the tacos were amazing in their house made corn shells with just the right amount of fillings. The fish and chips was A LOT OF FOOD!!!  Three pieces of fish and two of the best corn fritter style hush puppies I've ever tasted. Chips aka fries were plentiful!
You will enjoy this place. Go have a drink and enjoy the great food!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant had really good food. The chips and salsa were fresh, the guacamole was made after we ordered it, and we got the chicken tostada salads which were BOMB!! I also had white wine sangria which was fresh and light. The prices are on the high side for Mexican food- probably because you are right on the strip. If you sit outside you can see the fountain show. Go during happy hour to save some money!!"}
{"text":"I have never been to a restaurant that blank out discriminates! We were seated outside and our server refused to get us drinks because he told my brother he had \"droopy eyes\". My brother had a serious eye condition and was shocked by the servers comments. We asked for a manager and didn't get any support. With that said, we left the restaurant and no longer cared to eat there. It is wrong to call customer names. I will take this up with my lawyer and ensure they are contacted. It's unfortunate."}
{"text":"My drink was more lime flavoring than alcohol. Thank goodness I had a personal of 1800 in my purse. I took shots in between each sip. Please forgive me but I came for the alcohol."}
{"text":"Friday night dinner with coworker.  We got seated at the front rail with a great view of the south Las Vegas blvd. The waiters was friendly and very helpful with ordering.  The food was typical Mexican fare with strong margaritas and an assortment of Mexican beers.  We had a great time and would comeback and recommend this to new visitors for the view drinks and food.  Check this place out. YELP SPECIAL."}
{"text":"Between flights, we decided to grab a cocktail or two from the Cabo Wabo Cantina. It looked like a nice spot to rest until it was time to go yet again. 

For my first drink, I ordered the Tequila Sunrise. It was a bit too sweet and had to add a little club soda. My guy ordered a beer and as a finale, we ordered the Cabo Wabo Margarita. That was pretty good and in a nice big glass. 

Our Bartender was very nice, accommodating and had a nice conversation with.  I guess they see their fare share of people from everywhere, every single day."}
{"text":"Came to Cabo Wabo for the first time with LA Epic club crawl and absolutely fell in love with this place. The club crawl is absolutely awesome by the way. Best one in Vegas and I've been on many.  But Cabo Wabo was just a great starting point. Beer pong, fun LA Epic club crawl group, great tequila and awesome bartenders. What more could you possibly want?! Oh and the view of the strip from the upstairs bar is amazing. Bet it's a great place to watch the New Years fireworks. I'll have to remember that next New Years Eve for sure."}
{"text":"Had a bite here yesterday.  Hubby and I shared flautes appetizer and fish tacos. Both were good. Guacamole served with flautes  fresh/good.  Not enough spice for me but that is what salsa is for, right!  Good smoky salsa. Chips ok.
I think I had \"CW\" margarita, very good
Staying next door at Paris so it was very convenient to walk to. Might go again tonight and try something else!"}
{"text":"Horrible Experience-Sammy Should be ashamed of the quality and poor service and remove his name from this venture. One of my friends and I went to Vegas right before Thanksgiving. We took some cameras and a video camera with us to shoot during our trip. 

\"The meat had marks on it from where the Jockey was hitting it\" (Rodney Dangerfield Quote from Caddyshack). 

We stopped at Cabo Wabo because I'd been to the one in Cabo and this one has a nice patio overlooking the strip. We thought we could get some drinks, watch the people, and roll our camera a bit overlooking the strip. We sat on the Patio of this horrible restaurant for 15 minutes while 3-4 waiters walked by without even acknowledging us. 

First person to visit us was the manager dressed in a hoodie and jeans with a radio earpiece in his ear like he was protecting the president or something. Really, this guy is in charge? He came over before asking us if we wanted a drink, welcome/greeting, etc. and started asking us questions about our cameras and scolding us that we cannot use them on the property. Only still pictures. I explained to him that we were there to spend money buy drinks and eat dinner and he was still very rude. I also told him that we had been there for 15 minutes without a greeting while his waitstaff walked by and that we were planning on eating there. He asked us more questions about our cameras then gave us a lecture about 9/11 and that one of the buildings on the strip next to them was threatened in 2001. In a city where most of the population are tourists with cell phones that have cameras and also carry leisure cameras he then accused us of \"Potentially Being Terrorists because we had cameras and were filming the site on the strip\". I explained to him that we were Americans from Texas. His reply was \"And Timothy Mcveigh was also an American\". This manager is beyond Douche-Bag at this point. We took still pics and we also used a camera that looked like a still pic camera and we still recorded video. He couldn't tell the difference even though he sat back 20 yards from us by the front door and watched us the entire time like we were criminals.  We were told NO video but we could take all of the still pics we wanted. Not sure how that will discourage terrorism. 

Finally, our waiter \"Juan\" came by. And let me tell you \"Juan\" was NO SPEEDY GONZALEZ. Turtles and Snails were driving by this guy like the Indy 500 he was so slow. So we order some beers. Juan told us that their carbonation and water was bad and that the beer was flat. And yes, he was right, I had the worst dos equis beer ever and my friends beer was nasty too. Tasted like day old beer. It was warm and flat and tasted like two day old beer fermenting in a glass on a table and it was very flat, no bubbles. Worst beer I've had since I was in high school. Next I ordered a margarita and I tried to get a top shelf that was frozen. Juan explained to me that \"You don't drink frozen margaritas with top shelf liquor\". Really, I'm from Texas Biotch and if I want Herradura or something better in my margarita, I'll order it. I'm the customer. \"Have you ever heard of a TOP SHELF Margarita Biotch?\"

Besides I'm from Texas I drink Margaritas daily and I live in a place where we know our margaritas. I'll have to say, the margarita (that was not top shelf and just well liquor) was pretty crappy for a Mexican restaurant. I've had better margaritas in Wisconsin and Minnesota and those people don't know what the hell a margarita is. So we ordered some food . 

\"the meat had marks on it from where the Jockey was hitting it\" (Rodney Dangerfield Quote from Caddyshack). 

Really for $17 I could have gotten a better meal at Mcdonalds. The guy I was with ordered Nachos which were just a pile of cheese on chips not much for variety or flavor. They were flat and looked crappy too. Oh yeah, the manager followed my friend to the restroom and sat back about 20 yards from us to watch us the entire time. I guess he felt he was going to prevent a terror attack by stopping our filming of the Las Vegas strip. Typically I tip 20% or more but here I left him a 10% tip and even felt bad. So if you want low quality mexican food, watered down flat beers, and watered down \"well\" margaritas you should check out Cabo Wabo. The only positive about this place is that the view off the patio on the strip is cool and you can see the Bellagio fountains. I hope the health department prevents this factory of food poisoning to continue to serve food and sicken the world and the ultimate sin of messing up a great patio that could be much better if they actually had drinks that tasted good and couldn't mess up \"beer\" from a Keg. A few hours later we both got stomach aches from the food and felt very sick to our stomachs. We now know what happens to the horses at the track that don't make 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. Tip for the day: Don't bet or order horse #5"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places we hit on the strip.  Good service and decent food.  Value for dollar and yelp scored us a free drink."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Wow! Danny M was our server and didn't d a terrific job. Kudos. Atmosphere is vibrant, music is a bit loud for conversation."}
{"text":"Great all around. The tortilla soup was fabulous and the service from everyone was awesome! The only reason for 4 stars was nothing really blew me away."}
{"text":"Very happy with our waitress, Aia. The food was tasty, but a little pricy for what we got, but we weren't surprised, as it is Vegas. Each meal was about $17 and my beer was $7. Very unhappy with the table of guests near us that kept dropping the f-bomb."}
{"text":"Outstanding CW Margarita! Guacamole is made in house and delicious!! Sit on the rail and overlook the sidewalk on Las Vegas Blvd. the people watching adds to the whole experience!"}
{"text":"What a cool place ! I'm a hagar fan so this was treat for me.
Food was great.. (had wings mostly). drinks were great too.. and sat outside which was nice as well.."}
{"text":"My party dined here a couple hours before J. Lo's show, and I must admit that I enjoyed the food more than I expected. 

I am a bit of a Mexican-food snob & prefer mom n pop type of Mexican joints. I was expecting OK tasting food & expensive prices since it's on The Strip. 
The prices were quite high for the amount of food you get, but I was surprised at how delicious the chimichangas & cheese quesadillas were!

The setting was very casual & VERY loud. I couldn't hear my friends from across the table. But, it has a decent view of the Las Vegas Blvd & the Water Fountain Show at Bellagio.

Overall experience: it satisfied my hunger & I had a great time with my party.

Would I eat here again? Probably not =/"}
{"text":"CONTEXT: Recently graduated college dudes stop by Cabo Wabo at the tail end of a weekend, because it has the unbeatable combination of queso and 97 televisions.

THE REVIEW: Jesus Herbert Christ.  We went into this not caring that it had a 2ish star review, and expecting it to be standard sub-par Tex Mex.  What we got were plates of butt vomit, mildly unique from each other, served in convenient thirty minute intervals.

I guess I should mention positive aspects of the experience first.  The hostess was very, very attractive, as were many of the kind, smart, and important ladyfolk on the waitstaff.  We must have been assigned the one legacy bid, but that wasn't much of a big deal (side note - there were about 150 waitresses, all coming from upstairs or the kitchen, at all times.  There were twenty patrons.  Who are you serving?  What the hell is upstairs!?  Irrelevant.  I apologize).  When ordering, the waitress let us know that salsa came with the queso, and it would be a waste of money to order the chips and salsa.  That's groovy, in my book.  She did that once or twice again when we were ordering our meals, and probably saved us about ten dollars by letting us know random things our hangovers weren't allowing us to pick up on by ourselves.  Lastly, there was a TV in every corner, and they were all on the Sunday night NFL game.  No nonsense from ESPN8: The Ocho or garbage political newsfeeds.  Bueno.

The one reason we stopped here, above all others, was cheese dip.  It is a staple of our recovery rubric.  It is a communion cracker of sorts, after a bingy, gambly wreck of a weekend in Las Vegas.  The queso at Cabo Wabo was of decent consistency, with pico de gallo sprinkled on top.  It never filmed, it wasn't powdered-cheese-turn-queso.  It was physically acceptable.  It tasted, however, like government cheese with a hint of dirt or motor oil from the ungloved hand that had handled it prior to putting it into a bowl and melting it.  Did we eat it?  Shit yes.  Should we have?  I don't know, but it still feels like the demon sauce is painted onto my esophagus.  It came with thick chips that probably would have been tasty, had they been heated or lightly salted before arriving.  The salsa is a thick roasted pepper (chipotle?) salsa that was on the edible side of questionable.

I had been craving fajitas all weekend, mostly because my phone auto-corrected a slur I had written in a text to the word \"fajitas\" on the night of our arrival.  Karma for my ignorant textual intention greeted me fist-to-face when I received my hamburger steak fajitas, which arrived with a fajita sizzlesmell that literally caused people at the table to cough.  If your lungs bark at the smell of a food, you're probably experiencing the triggering of some sort of evolutionary warning system.  I ignored it.  My meatloaf fajita was served very well done, over a bed of 90% onions and 10% red peppers.  The fajita complements were all satisfactory, and by the end of the meal, I was making soft tacos with just the guac, sour cream, refried beans, and shredded cheese.

My friends ordered the jalapeno chicken burrito thing, the fish tacos, and the kids' menu chicken fingers.  No one liked their food, save for the manchild who ordered from the kids' menu.  I think the chicken fingers would have been difficult to sabotage, though, given the effort in doing so to the other dishes.  Of note - four chicken strips were twelve dollars.  The fish tacos were particularly no good.  It seemed like someone had forgotten to deep fry them, or had intentionally *shrug* *middle finger to no one in particular* *microwave*'d them.

Our bill came out to about 25 dollars a person.  That may be an inaccurate number, though, because I don't know if it garnered interest while we waited for our waitress to pop out of her coma and acknowledge us.  The booth at which we were seated was a backseat pulled from a 1983 Ford Tempo, and our cups of pond water may have had mosquitoes camping out on them.  I can't recall.  Notwithstanding our miserable experience, the $4.00 plastic cup of Coke I ordered was delicious...

OH!  Afterthought!  We were denied outdoor seating, despite the 8-10 empty tables we noticed on the patio.  It was probably for the best, as the daystar would have ruined us worse than Cabo Wabo did on its own.  I wish I had more hands, so I could give Sammy's place four thumbs down.  As a connoisseur of substandard Mexican food, I implore you to avoid this place.  The Megan Fox lookalikes out front are Sirens, I promise."}
{"text":"Awesome service by Sarah Marie! Great energy and atmosphere!! The Ahi Tuna & Jalapeno Chicken was delicious! We look forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Bottomless mimosas?!? What?? Our first visit was so good we had to come back.  The first day we had tacos and a tower margarita, both were perfect.  Our breakfast trip was even better, we loved the mexiacan cowboy platter.  The service was fantastic even though they were super busy.  Tamra and Doug are the best!"}
{"text":"Husband and I went for our anniversary weekend and stopped here for lunch. Jordan our waitress was super friendly, had time to answer my questions (first timers at this location), and didn't seem rushed as she went from table to table making sure all clients were taken care of.

I ordered the fajitas and they were amazing.  The chipotle rub on them was different in a good way and the place was packed as it was the NFL playoffs. 

I also ordered a margarita that was very strong! No weak ones here! So there is an outdoor seating area that usually has a waiting list, but the inside is comfortable as well.  Feels like spring break at this restaurant/bar.

Have fun!"}
{"text":"I don't know if you have to be a complete douchbag/douche-dudette  to work here but, THE SERVICE SUCKS!!!!!

I wanted chicken wings and I had heard they have pretty good wings. Called to make a take-out order and girl sounded chipper when I called but, once I asked for take-out, her mood changed quick and she said, \"ohh, what do you want?\"

Ordered my wings and asked if it came with carrots/celery sticks; and she said, \"I guess..\" 
Really? I guess...if you work in a restaurant, you should know the food you have. And if you don't, you ask someone that does! Simple.

When I went to pick up my order 20 minutes later, they said my order wasn't even placed. I had to wait ANOTHER 15 minutes!

Needless to say, I lost my appetite. For the food. And especially the service."}
{"text":"Had I written a review several years ago - this would be 5 stars.  This place, however, just did not measure up this trip like it has in the past.  We had terrible service that was beyond slow.  Their current happy hour also includes only beer and fireball concoctions.  No happy hour margaritas???  And the beers were expensive, so while it was buy one get one - you were paying twice as much as you would in some other bars on the strip.  I'd only visit again with a coupon from the people advertising on the street.  So many other great places, don't waste your time until this place gets its act back together!"}
{"text":"I was seated at the patio, very tiny place, with cramped seating. Did not enjoy my dinner, because the food looks great but it didn't taste that good. It's definetly not authentic Mexican food, would rate it the best bar food so far. Regardless of the food I found my dinner experience here unenjoyable due to my seating. Most annoying seat ever. People kept constantly walking behind me bumping into my chair. I just wanted to enjoy my view of the Ballagio fountains but this ruined it for me. The food is pricy for what your getting. I get it's on the strip but not worth it. Won't be back unless its just to drink. service was bad the waitress kept ignoring us and being distracted when speaking to her. She also took 30min just to get us cashed out."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  My wife's margarita was too sweet for me (it was the coconut one).  My margarita was very good (not really worth the cost, but this is a touristy place).  Got the tequila \"flight\" which was 3-shots, one of each style of tequila and it was very good and a pretty good price for 3 shots of alcohol.  I probably don't need to return, but it's worth a first-time visit."}
{"text":"We took lunch with inside seating as the outside patio was too warm under the sun.

Food and Service were good!

Steak Taco (mild spicy)
Fish taco
Shrimp Taco (med spicy)
Crispy Chicken Wing and Fries

Will come back next time for patio seating."}
{"text":"This place has reasonably good chips and salsa (I'm from Texas so I'm picky about my salsa). Split a burger and fries that were good. The kicker was the frozen margarita they made me. I wanted a swirl margarita and they had never heard of it. I explained what it was and the waiter told the bartender. They came close but I have to say it was excellent if not exactly correct. (They poured Pinot on top of the margarita which worked out perfectly!) Enjoyed this place!"}
{"text":"I was lured here by the Groupon deal $30 for $60 worth of food and drinks. 

Came here for breakfast, and once seated we went through the same thing as other yelpers, we we're informed that we needed to be a party of 4 to get the $60 worth of food and drink. At this point I didn't even care anymore I was starving and had already ordered anyway. Manager was going to give us the $30 off (what we paid).

Hubby had a \"michelada\" and I had a mimosa. The michelada was warm, the spices and salt on the rim of the glass tasted awful. My mimosa was nasty, the orange juice tasted like sunny d and lacked champange.

I ordered their \"huevos rancheros\" and hubby got the Nachos version of the Huevos rancheros. Both came with breakfast potatoes. The food was surprisingly yummy. The orange sauce on the huevos and nachos had a great flavor.

By this time we had some friends join us at the table and we were able to use the $60 voucher. Overall I would only return here for the breakfast."}
{"text":"The dishes were a notch above frozen dinners of the Hungry Man variety. The beverages were predictable but served in plastic cups. The service was the worst I have experienced in a city that is replete with excellent service at many turns. We were lured into this venue by friends because of the proximity to a follow on function. Upon greater reflection, we should have just kept walking to the next and much better venue. It is a shame because there is great potential with a fantastic location."}
{"text":"Really good place to eat and have drinks by the strip, but my only disappointment was that they charge for EVERYTHING!! You want salsa or lemons for your tacos and it's $4 and they DONT EVEN tell you it's extra, you just see it on your check!!! 
And it's not like it's worth what they are charging you! They brought me 2 slices of lemons and that was $4 are you serious!?!?! 
So PEOPLE eat here but DONT ask for a side of salsa or lemons or even napkins because your going to get charged extra without you knowing!"}
{"text":"We went there on a Tuesday night in Jan. 2010. The weather was nice (of course) so we decided to sit outside. There were maybe 20 people or so on the patio overlooking the strip. There were no seats looking out on the strip so we sat down at a table and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. One waitress walked by and glared at us, giving me a look like \"what the fuck are you doing here and why are you making my life miserable?\" So we waited a few more minutes and left. 

What I observed while waiting was that the ritas are served in plastic cups, which tells me that they are not going to be good. And the food looked very mediocre. I doubt that Sammy would be happy. But then again, everything is so over-priced he probably is raking in the dough."}
{"text":"The food tastes terrible & is way overpriced for the quality. The tacos are mediocre, and they were the best tasting part of the whole dinner. The diablo shrimp was cooked in a sweet sauce, far from spicy. The beans taste like bbq sauce, and are nowhere near refried. We ordered a pitcher of the cadillac margs, but the mix they use tastes very sweet, not like a traditional margarita. Worst part is that the service was great & location was convenient on the Strip. Too bad the food quality is so low."}
{"text":"Being a local in LasVegas , Cabo Wabo is by far the go to place for Mexican and margaritas. The chicken wings are great , but you have to get the jalape√±o chicken ( get it in a wrap ) the secret it's amazing. The staff are awesome always welcoming. If you feel like having a few margaritas and watch a some foot traffic of LasVegas , Cabo Wabo deck is your spot."}
{"text":"We came here for a late lunch on a Sunday, perhaps around 2:30 in the afternoon.  The place wasn't as crowded as it apparently had been during the normal lunch hour as the wait staff informed us.  I asked for a quieter table in a corner somewhere and we were given the table next to the kitchen which was further away from the bulk of the other diners.

Two of us shared the chicken fajitas and a coconut mixed drink.  The drink was tasty and not wimpy.  It had toasted shaved coconut on the rim of the glass which was nice.  The fajitas were shared between two people and with a side of rice and beans provided enough food for two.  

Pros: lots of chips; friendly waitress, tender chicken
Cons: no onions in the fajitas (huh?!), had to ask for water refills, service was slow bringing extra plates, loud background music.

On the subject of the background music, when we came in the music was loud but not so loud as to prevent conversation.  We saw the head waiter/boss/manager-guy turn the music up to something that was too loud, and then at one point he turned it up even louder so that some waitress girls could dance on the bar top for (presumably) the entertainment of the diners.  The music unfortunately didn't make a descent down from the jet-engine level it had been set at for the amusement.  We saw one lady with her elderly mother get up, speak to the manager guy while gesticulating wildly, and then march out.  We couldn't hear anything of what they said because the music was too loud, but presumably they weren't pleased at the conversation-stopping level either.  

The location is convenient but if my memory serves me there is another cantina place in the same mall where one could go to eat and  communicate with fellow diners."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The atmosphere is very lively with great music and entertainment! Our server, Larissa, was very outgoing and helpful. She recommended the carne asada tempequena and it was to die for! The drinks are pricey but totally worth it considering how strong they were!! Every time I come to Vegas I'm eating here!!!"}
{"text":"Best damn breakfast we had the entire trip!!!  Lightning fast service! Great food! And awesome atmosphere! 

I had the.......drumroll.....eggs benedict!  I also had the Cabo wabo fried taters...those were great!  That benedict was perfect. Loaded with hollandaise just like I like it.  Coffee was great.  Chocolate milk was good and cold.  My dad had the Cabo wabo style eggs benedict. It had shredded beef mixed with chorizo instead of ham.....I tried it, should've gotten it instead.  It was awesome! 

I will be making this a regular stop from now on!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my daughter in laws favorite places as it has her cocarita.  I have always thought it was just \"ok\" here, but today was very impressed when one of the managers took over our table because our server got ill.  It's not just that she took over the table, her service and determinati"}
{"text":"Great drinks and a wonderful spot for people watching.  We sat on the bar facing the strip and watched the fountains, lights, traffic, and people for HOURS.  Lots of fun.  Live acoustic music, two guys playing covers. Well done and easy to catch yourself singing along."}
{"text":"If you are hungry, want small portions and pay outrageous amounts of money for less than mediocre service then you might consider eating her. Don't let Domino F serve you. Terrible service! We asked for extra napkins for a party of 6 and were only brought two. Drinks were expensive. $8 beers and $14 margaritas. Taco u -pick two plates are the best deal at $11. 

There are way better places to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"We went on a Monday night late so it wasn't too busy.  We were seated right way in the balcony area.  Restaurant is located outside of the Planet Hollywood Hotel and the Miracle Mile Shopping area, so it's the perfect spot for people watching and the views of the nearby hotels were great.  Our server had a few tables going, but made it a point to greet us right way to get in our drink orders (most important).  We didn't have to wait too long for your entr√©e to arrive, all piping hot!  I had a chicken burrito, enchilada style and the others have the fish tacos, 3 huge tacos!  All very yummy!

OVERALL EXPERIENCE:  Fun atmosphere!  Food is tasty and plenty.  Would've liked to hear more of Sammy Haggar's music playing.  Priced moderately.

When in Cabo, Mexico, check out the restaurant there.  Good food, authentic.  The d√©cor is awesome.  There is a hugh wrestling ring right in the center of the restaurant for Saturday nights Nacho Libre matches!  Now how cool is that!"}
{"text":"I don't know. Years ago I noticed that Cabo Wabo has a lighthouse as part of the exterior decorations. Back when I was single I actually owned and decorated my apartment with nick-nacks of lighthouses. I am married now, with kids, and yes a resident of Las Vegas. Lighthouses, actual and my have become extinct.

Here Cabo Wabo, the food was good. For an appetizer we ordered some good old fashioned chips and salsa, which were fine, although a few of our chips were stale. I ate fajitas (steak and chicken combo) and they were fine. The tortillas, three of them, were served wrapped in paper. two of the three tortillas needed to be peeled apart. I don't know, that just didn't seem right to me. My wife ordered a burrito and says it tasted fine. 

She also ordered a side of guacamole which cost $9.00. I ordered some french fries which cost $5.00. Seems to me these two side orders should have cost the same. I don't know, maybe that's just me. 

Seating, I don't know, I like having some elbowroom myself. But it's non-existant here. Tables are very close together. I noticed severs having to \"squeeze it in\" more than once while walking between tables. If there were an emergency situation. Or something loud like a car backfiring near-by, this crowded patio could become a problem.

When we arrived at Cabo Wabo we were inside The Miracle Mile shops. So we stopped at the host stand inside. We were told to go outside to the outside host stand. Now, I don't know, maybe it's just me, but if I were the host I would have said something to the effect of \"We have a host stand just outside as well, follow me, let me take you there.\" I don't know just sounds a little more professional to me.

As the wife and I were departing, we passed by the Lighthouse to go inside and return to the Miracle Mile Shops. My wife mentioned that the inside of the place was quite empty (it was about 1:00pm) and was surprised the hostess didn't just seat us or walk us through like earlier mentioned. I don't know. I really want to like Cabo Wabo. My wife really enjoyed the experience. I'll wait to read her review and maybe rethink the whole persoal experience."}
{"text":"You had me at tacos. And took me at tequila. Haha! But really. Great place to eat with live entertainment. Can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Food and drink was quite expensive for Mexican food! The margarita was good the chips and salsa were extra and just average not blown away. We ordered fish tacos, carnitas, carne Asada just average. Ambience was great right on the strip probably why the high prices! Probably would not return for a second visit. A Lot of food for the prices though! I do have to say the Spanish rice was really yummy!"}
{"text":"Eat here if you like terrible music playing loudly in your ear, $12 vodka tonics made with Sprite and hair, rude servers, food that may or may not make you vomit four times in the middle of the night, and slow service. Seriously. Don't go here if your life depends on it."}
{"text":"Our 1st time here and we were not impressed with the drinks or service. The waitress didn't like her job & seemed annoyed.  Chips were stale and margaritas were uninspiring and served in plastic cups. Definitely not in Cabo."}
{"text":"Ordered fish tacos.   Food was cold and rice was like rubber.  Waitress Laura was very pleasant and nice.   Hostess was stuffy and acted very arrogant.  Wed.  5/22/13 evening."}
{"text":"We popped in for a drink and I bought one of those obnoxious tall drink thingy-ma-bobs and filled it with some sort of frozen concoction the girl behind the counter suggested.  Some folks ordered food, but I had already eaten so I can ony rate my drink experience.  The atmosphere was fun and seemed low key, but we were there early in the day.  Definitely try it out."}
{"text":"Warning: you will get scammed by their frozen drink bartenders. 

I'm not talking about the strength of the drinks which is also debatable. But what I'm talking about is an annoying pyramid scheme which my friends experienced while here this weekend. 

We were wandering around the Strip one afternoon when my friends wanted a frozen boozy slushy. Cabo Wabo was closest and decided to wait in line for it, myself included since I can partake in a frozen daiquiri from time to time. The bartender tried to sucker my friends into larger drinks than they wanted, and then poured in an extra shot of rum into their drinks without really getting confirmation. The spiel of the extra shot is that you get to spin a magic wheel with prizes on it--hats, free drinks, the like. The catch, which comes after the bartender pours her extra shot is that there is only one spin per group. I'm gonna throw the bullshit flag there. After my friend won a \"Cabo shot\" the bartender said \"the bigger the tip, the bigger the show\" at which point I said point blank to her face, \"so basically it's a pyramid scheme so you guys get more money.\" She looked at my like I was a) right and b) a witch with a \"b.\" 

This whole experience left me incredibly frustrated as a hostess and makes me dislike management and company policy for something so ridiculous."}
{"text":"My husband and I are locals and bought a groupon and decided to try this place out. We were quickly seated at the bar stools that overlook the strip. Perfect since my husband loves to people watch. First, we ordered a margarita. I asked her if there were any drinks they were special for and she said everything so I got strawberry. Probably the worst margarita I've had lately. Then, we ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer. Again, awful. The chips were really hard and tasted stale. We got some type of quesadilla that was pretty good. Overall the service and food was pretty decent. I'm a pretty harsh critic. I would have given 3 stars but it was getting cold and we asked for the bill and she said she would be right back for the groupon. It took about 5 minutes for her return. She finally took my phone and disappeared for another 10 minutes. She didn't give me a book with my receipt so there was nowhere to put my money. So this place was ok, but I definitely will not be going there again. But if you have a groupon, it's worth it if you don't feel like traveling far and you're in that area."}
{"text":"Food was edible but tiny portions for such high prices. My sister and i arrived our server was friendly at first we started with a pitcher of beer and then a couple appetizers an order of guacamole, the shrimp ceviche and the carne asada quesadilla. When we only ordered appetizers our server seemed a little annoyed. The guac was tasty while i only took a bite of my quesadilla since it was oozing grease and my sis liked the ceviche but it looked so different from most ceviche. Now back to the server i wanted to split the cost down the middle i used a card my sister used cash, i wanted to leave the tip on my card so he comes back and asked if we needed the change i said yes and he became such a sourpuss! He handed us $10 cash back assuming since we asked for change we were going to leave him a crappy tip.  I was shocked at his blatant annoyance, i still tipped him 17% even though we were super easy and laid back, what a jerk! One place I won't return."}
{"text":"The place was decent crowded but it's Vegas. We didn't care to much for the waiter she was rude very rude. I felt like she was rushing us to order and get moving. I had to stop her and tell her\"ma'am I would really appreciate it if u would let us order in peace without rush thank you\" she rolled her eyes and walked away I could careless about her feelings or her thoughts. However the food and drinks were good the view was great outside views of the strip. My only issue was her attitude the way she carried herself not lady like."}
{"text":"Me and my wife go to Vegas several times a year and the most recent trip we decided to stop in  and give it a try the food was great and service was good it was very loud inside though we couldn't even hear each other at our table most because of obnoxious other customers not fault of the business. I would recommend it for fast Mexican food on the strip though"}
{"text":"Fun Sunday afternoon on the patio. Loving  the live music by Shawn Eiferman. Great views, awesome food & drink, and service with a smile."}
{"text":"Loved the food and service. The spicy chicken with cilantro was excellent. Plus a free margarita with a Yelp checkin made the lunch even better :)"}
{"text":"Hellloooo Cabo Wabo. After a night of drinking and going out, this place hit the spot. We had their spicy margaritas which were literally amazing. The nachos weren't impressive, probably would not recommend but the rest of the menu was awesome. Our whole party had a great experience and I would totally go back. 

Side note when we went they had live music. Was there with a whole bachelorette party and they played the brides favorite tunes!"}
{"text":"Fun party/cantina vibe. My husband and I were in L.V. this last week and stopped here for some drinks and lunch this past Tuesday afternoon around 1:30 or 2:00 and were seated immediately, we were asked where we wanted to sit indoors or patio, we opted for the patio as it was lively with good upbeat music and bright colorful scenery. 

We were greeted by a friendly waiter and given ice water and asked if we would like some drinks to get started, we ordered shots and a beer and a margarita, the beer could have been a bit cooler, but otherwise it was good.

My husband had the fish tacos and I had the chicken taquitos and we shared the rice and beans from the taco platter. We did have to ask for chips and salsa and wish we had received them when we got our drinks, but otherwise food was great service was great and they had a photographer taking souvenir photos. He did not pester or pressure us and he took a great photo of us so we ended up purchasing one of the photos. 

Would definietely return, the service, ambience and drinks were great for a fun and lively time on the strip. Great lunch spot with a great view, you can even see the fountains at the Bellagio so it was very nice."}
{"text":"Okay, so I admit that this place wasn't first on my list of restaurants to visit while in Vegas.  However, the people I was with were starving and when this place came into our line of sight, we pretty much decided this was it for the evening's meal.  Since we are east coasters, we were there earlier than most for dinner.  We got seated right away and the place was not busy at all.  Our server was fast and brought our drinks, chips and salsa right away.  

Everyone at our table ordered different things, from fajitas to tacos to burritos.  Everyone enjoyed their food and the price was not bad considering how high it could have been for its location on the strip.  

The waitresses all dancing every half hour (or whatever it is) is actually entertaining because some of them are really into it and others are definitely not.  It entertained our group at least.  

Decent food, decent prices, excellent location."}
{"text":"A scrambled egg quesadilla sounded really weird to me, but I agreed to try it. We split the breakfast quesailla and added a side of guacamole. Shockingly, it was extremely tasty. I am glad I added the guacamole, because it really brought together the flavors in the quesadilla. It was served with a side of potatoes and a semi spicy sauce. Great start to the day. To accompany the quesadilla we each got a drink.  I went with the Desert Pear Margarita and Brian went with the crazy, alcohol fueled Can't Drive 55. Both were great choices, but I would suggest getting a pitcher.  You get more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Guac is the bomb! (do people still say that?) Filling and great prices for being right on the strip. Great atmosphere and friendly service. Great view and perfect for people watching"}
{"text":"Went to Cabo Wabo with the family in August 2015, and found it was nothing like the Cabo Wabo in Mexico.

This Cabo Wabo is located on the corner of the Planet Hollywood Resort, on the Strip.

The good part of our visit was the margaritas.  We decided it was a better value to get the pitcher.  The margaritas where delicious, and had a good about of tequila in them.  If you decide to visit the restaurant, I would only come for the margaritas.  The server was also very friendly and attentive.

The food items were very expensive, and the portion size was very small.  I have seen more rice and beans on children's plates at other restaurants.  On the plus side the small portions you do get taste good and are freshly made.

Some of the negatives:

I have never been to a Mexican restaurant where they didn't toss a basket of chips and salsa on your table when you sat down.  Here it's a $6 charge if you want chips and salsa.

Most of the items do not come with beans and rice, that will cost you and additional $7 on top of the cost of the entree dish.

Check your bill before paying.  I noticed a $8 \"CNF\" charge on my bill.  When I asked what that was I was told it was a concession fee because the Planet Hollywood charges them for being on the property.  Basically, Cabo Wabo wants to charge me outrages food prices and then on top of that help pay their rent.  I informed the server I wanted to speak to the manager because I was not going to pay this additional fee.  She returned with different bill with the CNF fee removed.  I can't imagine how many people pay that fee without asking a question as to why. 

Although the margaritas were delicious, and the food good, albeit small in portion, I would not come back here because of the very expensive prices and because of them trying to add on additional charges to my tab without informing me."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there Thursday night to grab a drink and some quick food. It was a little chilly outside and they said the indoors is closed therefore we sat outside. We were greeted by our server, Anthony. We probably had a terrible day because he was rude to us as soon as he came by. He started cursing saying 'why the f*** we need the heaters on' the minute it was on. As i mentioned above, it was cold outside and most of the tables had the heaters on. He looked extremely irritated and he had absolutely no manners. He got the order wrong, never even said he was sorry or how long it will take for the food to cone out. We had to ask for salt, ketchup and mayo from different persons because he never approached the table after he had dropped our drinks. The hostess and the food runner were extremely polite and friendly (I'm sorry i don't know their names). We travel a lot and go to Vegas often but unfortunately one server like this one could make me never go back to the same place. It's sad seeing unhappy customers just because one server has no manners and it's bad at doing his job. Both me and my friend work in restaurant industry and had never had such bad service."}
{"text":"some awesome margaritas were served up in addition to a really yummy lobster burrito.  went here to get away from stuffy bellagio and got grwat food and service!!"}
{"text":"I love Sammy H but this place has the  worst service if u are not sitting at the bar!  Food just ok- I tried it twice last week and won't be back to eat- just drink."}
{"text":"Beautiful view!  However,  the outside seating is pretty tight.  I had to move twice around the table to accommodate people around me.  The food was amazing and average priced for Vegas. Be careful with the alcohol ... i ordered a double,  barely tasted the liquor and one of them cost me $21."}
{"text":"Used to go there often not so much since Shawn Eiferman isn't there playing music anymore. Food is ok, there used to be such a fun vibe that all the visitors would get into the action but now they have a guy from the Voice there and he is just kind of an arrogant guy and the drummer is a jerk.  Too bad they let Shawn go he was the showman, we follow him around Vegas and have for years and take our friends to hear him too. He is an entertainer that fills the house."}
{"text":"YES!!!!!!!!! What a pleasant surprise this place was. Hunted around on Groupon to find a bargain and landed here. The food was soooooooo good. We could walk to it from our hotel since it was on the main strip. Not to busy when we went - but even if it was the space is large! Upstairs for private parties, open main dining area and an outside patio that overlooks the strip. Go on a night when the have live music. Good vibes and good eats. Looking forward to going back!!!"}
{"text":"I am giving 4 stars only because I thought that our server was awesome! The food was good and their salsa was great! The service was kind of slow but its Cabo Wabo so they can kind of get away with it. I will go back later than sooner cause the set up and view is awesome! In would definitely suggest leaving your kids at home!"}
{"text":"Save Yourselves!!!!!!

The only reason for 2 stars is that their Coconut Margarita was so yummy that I promised myself I wouldn't give Cabo Wabo only 1 star.

But really....they're only deserving of 1 star....Cabo Wabo serves Tex Mex food....how can ANY Tex Mex taste bad?  Well, Cabo Wabo does it! 

I ordered the fish tacos...but they were out of them!  So then I ordered the shrimp tacos....and again they were out of them!  But somehow they had the shrimp quesadillas, so that's what I went with.  What I got were these WET triangle things, that had no shrimp and basically just alot of wet cheese.  It was disgusting.  I couldn't eat it....and I eat anything Tex Mex.  

IF you come to Cabo Wabo (and I would really think hard about it) my advice is to just sit at the bar and have a couple margaritas.  Thankfully they don't screw that up.  Don't eat here though.  Eat your Mexican at Dos Caminos at Palazzo or Pink Taco at Hard Rock."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!! Best fried calamari I have had in a long time, and the aioli dipping sauce served with it was excellent. Nachos were a big hit with our party too. Fun music and atmosphere. Definitely will be coming back when in town next."}
{"text":"Came here the day we were leaving Vegas! I loved the food especially the fish tacos ! We got free margaritas because of our yelp check in. Two things I didn't like . We walked in through the inside of the mall and there were like 4 hostess standing at the entrance talking and didn't acknowledge my 4 friends and I  so we walked in then one girl followed us and asked if we needed help . My friend said yeah we'll do we wait for you or do we sit ourselves ? She said no you have to wait for is and laughed . So we just went to the outside entrance.When we got there it was half and hour before lunch so we decided to grab drinks meanwhile I asked one of the 4 outside hostess if they had micheladas. She literally stood there is a \"uhh idk what that is\" and a smirk . I mean???? Common!! By then I had seen it under the menu and told her. What do you mean? It's on your menu!! Cabo wabo please hire people who know the menu. Our waiter tho was amazing! He brought us chips and was very attentive !"}
{"text":"Want to pay a lot of money ($60) for a mediocre lunch for two? This is your place. As an added bonus you get really loud music, plastic cups for your drinks and you have to pay for chips and salsa. Keep walking, even if you are tired and hungry like we were."}
{"text":"Tacos were delicious but the staple of Mexican food is the rice and beans. Rice tasted like it came out of a bag. Even Taco Bell does a better job with rice. Beans were ok. Margarita was strong and tasted quite horrible.  

Overall not worth the 80$ spent. Save your money and go to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"It was just alright. Salad was the best. Seriously overpriced for what we got. I guess you are paying for the name."}
{"text":"Nice d√©cor and we were seated inside quickly.  The service was ok as he was busy with too many tables.  My wife had shrimp and I had the hamburger and we only drank soda.  The food was ok.  I expected a lot better quality for the price.  I understand that because it is on the strip, the prices would be higher, however, the quality of the food should be better.  The bill came to $57.  The only thing that really bothered me was when the waiter circled the suggested tip of 20% on the check.  Don't tell me what to tip please.  And no, he did not get the 20% he wanted just because of that."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend are stopping by here to have a lunch. We were planning to go to the Ramsay but the line is too long and we were starving. 
So I am here. No need to wait. We have a seat right away. But turns out there weren't that many people because of the food is BAD. Tortilla soup was tasteless and the enchiladas was wayyyy too salty. 
BAD experience for both of us."}
{"text":"Decent food. Our waiter was very friendly. Initially they brought out all of our food very cold but apologized profusely and rushed to bring us out new (hot) orders."}
{"text":"This place serves frozen supposedly alcoholic drinks, similar to Fat Tuesdays.

They have blue lemonade, pi√±a colada, strawberry, margarita, vida loca, and cherry lemonade to choose from. You can also choose to get two flavors swirled together.

However, I say \"supposedly alcoholic\" because my boyfriend and I not only weren't able to taste any alcohol (which is fine), after downing a 46 or 42 ouncer together, neither of us could feel any of the alcohol either. And I'm quite the light weight. We ordered less at Fat Tuesdays and felt it.

What a rip-off."}
{"text":"This place was extremely disappointing.  I went there for dinner earlier in the week. It was very crowded, but not just with people, the tables are way too close together it is a very unpleasent atmosphere.  It was also way too loud in there, you had to shout to be heard by the people you were sitting with.  It was dinner time, not night club time, there was just no reason to have to music so loud at that time of day.   Atmosphere aside, the food was just down right bad.  I had the fish and chips and spent the rest of the evening trying not to vomit as I walked the strip.  It actually made me queezie. 
Lastly, this place is expensive, a beer....one 12 ounce bottle of beer was $8.00.  Eight dollars for 1 bottle of Coors Light!   There are many places to eat on the Vegas Strip, I for one will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"I decided to eat inside because the weather was sooo sooo hot in Vegas over the weekend.  I was traveling on a work trip and eating alone.   If you've ever done that you probably know that wait staff tend to look at you wierd as they'd rather serve a table of two and get a bigger tip rather than seat a single person in a booth for two.  That said, I felt that a bit at Cabo Wabo, but overall my waitress was very good and considerate of my needs.

Note - unlike most mexican restaurants you may be familiar with, you pay extra here for chips and salsa.  Even if you want salsa to dress your chopped salad you pay $1 for it. I guess that is the nature of eating on the strip though ... almost nothing's cheap. 

That said I ordered a chopped vegetarian southwest salad an it was EXCELLENT.  Seriously one of the best salads I can remember in a long time and I'm a vegetarian so I eat a lot of salads.  I'd gladly eat there again.

My only regret is I checked into yelp late and missed their check in offer for a free house margarita with an entree.  I ordered an upgraded margarita instead but saved the offer in case I go back.  I'd happily go back and enjoy that salad again.

Don't forget to check in before you order."}
{"text":"I think this might be generous. The fajitas were so bland, the rice was crunchy, they charged $21 for two beers, and service at bar was rude! We will never go there again!"}
{"text":"The fact that you get a free margarita with any entree for checking in with yelp might be swaying my opinion here... But this place does have decent Mexican food.  I've always gone for lunch as I was traveling for work, and never had any problems. I'm not sure if I would give anywhere in Vegas 5 stars just due to the price gouging everywhere."}
{"text":"I got the steak and chicken fajitas, the proteins them selves where pretty good, well cooked and seasoned pretty good. Classic fajitas veggies, red and green peppers, onions. But the thing that was odd was all the other toppings were in these strange shaped side plates, it was kind of messy. Other then that, the beans sucked. Luke warm, mushy and frankly unappealing. The rice tasted like it came out of a box. Honestly this place was a bit of a let down, I was expecting something delicious when i walk down the strip of Las Vegas. The building inside looks cool, lots of art and live music too! I highly recommend taking a picture with the framed picture of nickleback."}
{"text":"This place is really fun. It has a typical Cantina Vibe, true to the nature of Cabo Wabo down and Cabo San Lucas Mexico. Our servers Tammy and Danny were awesome. We actually came back on the following day just because of them. And once again awesomeness. 



Sammy's tequila shrimp is great 6 shrimp in garlic and tequila lime sauce. Just get it. The homemade Chipotle vinaigrette is also great with anything you dip in it. Just a slight burn and tangyness.

Fajitas, and salada. It's all all good. 

The cake Open Table reservations as well as call in reservations however this does not apply to the outside at that. If you want to sit outside people watch enjoy the atmosphere of the strip, just know that reservations don't work. 

But seriously Danny and Tammy are fantastic. Danny is so cool."}
{"text":"This place was the bomb dot com! Ordered the nachos with grilled chicken, they were amazing - they put both regular cheese and queso dip on it! The service was quick and our waitress was very nice and professional, the food is a bit pricy but cheap for a place on the strip."}
{"text":"Happy hour!  After checking into our hotel we had already planned that this would be our first stop and we needed a drink!  Wanted to check out the place, and to get our Vegas on!  The Hubs and I both had a Margarita and we quickly decided to try the Happy hour Nachos and Tequitos. Both were really good and my picky husband commented on how good the beef was on the nachos. A little spendy for 2 Tequitos (even though they were big) Fun place!"}
{"text":"First off I'll be discussing their Margarita bar that faces the mall, and then the actual dining experience.

A friend of mine offered to buy all of us a Margarita. They had the usual sizes, and then some of the ridiculous huge weird ways of drinking. You can get the large long one that you see people walking around or a guitar. Honestly the smallest size they offered was more than enough. It was actually made really well, because usually most places I get them, they taste disgusting. I just had the original flavored one which was great. The person who served us had a well... uhmm huge rack :)

Now as for the food. Our other friend suggested that we try their ridiculous 8lb nacho platter challenge. Only up to 4 people can be involved, with no bathroom breaks, and a 55 minute time limit. If you should complete it, you get the meal for free. Otherwise it's 55 bux. Now I thought... well we just need to each eat 2 lbs, and I have ate 2 lbs of food before. So it's possible.

I was completely wrong. As soon as our waiter dropped it off, I already saw a wall of defeat immediately. It was ridiculously huge and had a ton of sour cream and guacamole. It was delicious to eat for 10 minutes, then the mental breakdown began. Staring at the food did not help, and we ended up quitting after 30 minutes in. We ate a good 70% of it. Now if there wasn't a challenge or hurry, I would have fully (no pun intended) enjoy it. It had shrimp, beef, and chicken in the mix. It was by far one of the best nacho's I have enjoyed.

Things I disliked: The chairs. Some of them or low and some of them are high. They don't give you the best support and are extremely heavy and uncomfortable.

The service was good, and he would regularly check in and check our status."}
{"text":"Food's good but not worth the price; extremely overpriced. You're actually paying for real estate because it does have an amazing view of bellagio. I think it's dumb to charge for tortilla chips; most Mexican restaurants doesn't charge for them.

I did like my margarita though, cabo wabo tequila is actually pretty good."}
{"text":"3 stars because the service was good both nights. I think the prices are too high and the food is mediocre. I had the tortilla soup and it's good but salty. Good amount of chicken. Taquitos were good and a safe bet. Tried the tacos and meh. The tequila lime shrimp is supposed to be a house specialty but the people next to me weren't too impressed. It was convenient and easy to grab a seat at the bar. I recommend the skinny margarita"}
{"text":"Had alot of fun here.

Yes it is overpriced like everything on the strip.  The food is just ok, but definitely not bad.

But it was a cool place to relax. If you become friends with the bartenders at the outside bar it is quite fun. They seem to have great convo's from everything from how to make drinks, to relationships, to Vaginal Flatulence.

Definitely Good Times."}
{"text":"Great views if u can get the outdoor patio on strip-we didn't want to wait 20 minutes...so sat inside. Got the upgraded grand marnier margarita on the rocks-tasted pretty good and looked pretty with different colors. I didn't like their chips and salsa-one of the worst salsas at a restaurant ever-ew like tomato paste. Their pico de gallo wasn't that great either. Food blech drinks good, server/hostess was very nice/attentive."}
{"text":"We stayed at Paris Casino next door earlier this week and had lunch here with my wife and in-laws..  They suggested it since it was close and they were yearning for Mexican..  I agreed. I thinking this would be another \"celebrity\" branded chain restaurant..  I like Sammy Hagar but wasn't sure if I'd like it..  It was excellent!!  I had the Chicken Enchiladas with Salsa Verde.. and the others had a variety of things including shrimp tacos etc..  All loved what they had. The warm chips and salsa was a great start..  I'm a new fan Cabo Wabo fan!!
 It took a while for me to come around but I'm here!  I live in Chicago and KNOW good Mexican food so take that for what it's worth!!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the low reviews because this was actually one of the best places we ate at in Vegas in terms of food, price, and service. Our server, Dione, was friendly and fast. Fast service is almost impossible to find on The Strip, so that deserves more credit than maybe it does in other parts of the country. It's also worth noting that the manager came around to check on us, too, which is a nice touch to make sure we were taken care of. The food was better than expected, and the prices are pretty reasonable when compared to the other restaurants in the area. Some of the folks on here complain about the music being too loud, which is funny because I commented while we were eating the volume was perfect for enjoying the music while still being able to hold a conversation. Personally, I think it's a bit silly to complain about music volume when \"cantina\" is in the name and you can hear the music as you're walking in."}
{"text":"Awesome food! l had the tequila  shrimp  and my wife had fish tacos ,both tasted great  especially  with a few shots of tequila   and a beach bar rum drink.The service was on top notch.I mentioned  our anniversary and the server put  Chicken Foot  on the stereo and gave us a couple  complimentary  shots..This was our 1st destination  on our vacation  and we're not let down.Thanks Sammy we will  be  back ."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Cabo Wabo because it is Sammy Hagar's Joint (He was the best singer for VH....DLR was a pussy-ass pouseur with a bad weave!). The one in Tahoe looks lame, this one looked closer to the original.

I tried the Carne Asada Nachos and my bro had Steak and Shrimp Fajitas. The Nachos were ok, mostly chips and that velveeta-ish type cheese, but the carne asada had good flavor..

The Steak and Shrimp Fajitas looked a bit small.

The prices were way too high for the amount of food and the quality. Next time, just buy a shirt!"}
{"text":"Being at the heart of the Vegas strip this place has the chance to absolutely kill it.  Has a chance....Based on my recent visit I would have tell anyone thinking of trying this place to think twice and try something else.  There are a lot of choices when it comes to eating and drinking on the strip.  The fact that Sammy Hagar has his name attached to this place will put people in the seats, but I won't be back.

Service was poor.  Our server was much more interested in the water gun fight going on with his co-workers than he was in any of the tables.  It's Vegas you should have a good time, but the patrons should have a better time.  Everyone that was seated around us was also frustrated.

The food was a little bit below average.  For the money I was not impressed.  We had ordered some nachos, chicken enchiladas, and a Jack and Coke burger. 

The real tragedy here were the drinks.  Until the day that I ate here I had never not finished a drink.  It was so sweet that it might have actually ruined my meal.  For $10 dollars or more this was the worst margarita that I have ever had, and I have had hundreds in my life.  Nobody at the table was able to finish their margaritas, and we all had a different flavor.  I said something to our server and he said \"I don't know what to tell you.\"  Something tells me they get that all of the time.

If I remember right there is a Fat Tuesdays down the hall inside of Planet Hollywood.  Stop there and enjoy the buzz."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant! Went there a few times. The weather was great to sit in the patio. Loved the musical artist. The drinks were awesome. There is this blue one blended tastes like kool aid and the alcohol just sneaks up on you......it slaps you all of a sudden. Be careful- lol. The service was good and the restrooms were clean. Great spot for tourist, drinks, and party goers."}
{"text":"Quite an amazing spot to enjoy drinks, appetizers or even dinner! Fantastic deck seating overlooking strip and Vegas!! -- Laura was our sexy & amazing server!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and had some tortilla soup as well, it was really good. Employees were nice and friendly, Would return again."}
{"text":"Thanks to Katie, I'm drinking bubblegum vodka drinks and telling everyone they are cosmos to save face... Great shrimp tacos, great drinks and cabo swag."}
{"text":"Loved it !! Could not put my fork down. Food came out quick, servers are super nice and the drinks are so good. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"When in Vegas, I always stop by Cabo Wabo. Not too sure why because we have one in LA. I've always remember this place to have a friendly staff. Eh, not this time around. I don't know if the staff was burnt out from partying the previous night but some looked like they have make up on from last night. The host are point of contact and I'm huge on customer service. The girls in the front have NO personality what so ever. Rude, no smile, plain straight face that looked like they own that damn podium stand, haha. Another girl who handled the drinks in the front looked at me up and down and rolled her eyes. Whoa, girl I was just wear a trench coat completely covered up. Seriously?! What kind of restaurant? Eh, when in VEGAS, I'll leave cabowabo alone. 2 stars for good wings, less 3 stars for terrible customer service.. I mean who wants to deal with attitude before even getting served."}
{"text":"Was OK.  Just a traditional tourist stop.  Bought a tee shirt,.  Reasonable prices for beverages. Glad I visited now checking it off as a place in visited.  Long trip from the JW or secrets."}
{"text":"The margaritas here are about the best I've ever had.  Ice is blended so smooth it was like a fine slush.  Mix and flavor were perfect too.  On the other hand, the food was extremely disappointing.  Had the chicken fajitas and they were not very good. Chicken was good, but everything else lacked flavor.  I've had much better Mexican food at chain restaurants.  I would go back for the margaritas, but I would,eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Happy Hour was such a steal! Our server was awesome and told us about the HH and we ordered so many drinks because it was so cheap! The food was delicious and the margaritas were so good! Definitely got me tipsy on a good one.

The area was generally pretty clean..a little sticky, but nothing too crazy. It's right along the busy parts of the strip so it was perfect to stop right in for some cold drinks!"}
{"text":"Husband and I were walking around and saw where they served breakfast 2 eggs, toast, meat, potatoes and unlimited mimosa's for $5.99 and we had to do it, it was only around 9am but why not we were in Vegas I mean. The food was very good and everything was done just right. The mimosa's were served in a beer glass so these were quite big and I had 4 of them, my husband had 3. We had to take a nap afterwards but it was worth it:)"}
{"text":"Had a great experience with the staff. Very helpful with my wrong coupon from groupon and we're able to help me out. The food was delicious. Had the tequila shrimp plate. Will def return to this place."}
{"text":"two stars : two reasons

location
late night dining

we were desperate and hungry.  this place was open.  we sat outside (nice).

margaritas were nasty, premixed, preservative laden crap.

did the apps sampler, at least we got some food in the belly. 

if you absolutely must, you'll probably survive :)"}
{"text":"Needed some of Sammys famous Mexican food and a margarita. Ordered the carne asada taco plate which does nit come with sour cream or cheese so if like me and need these on tacos order in addition, and only the sour cream was extra. Sampled this time just the house margarita which was surprising very good, and had too just to ensure potency.

The staff here is amazing and so is the atmosphere of the restaurant. What else is better rocking music from the 80s like Van Hagar and Journey. With great art that adorns the walls of all of Sammys triumphs in life."}
{"text":"Service is ridiculous! I ordered an appetizer sampler for take out and when I got to the hotel I was missing part of my order for chicken wings. I called the restaurant back and let them know the issue and considering they were the ones who messed up my order there was nobody willing to remedy the situation. The best they could Do was have me either walk back tonight or tomorrow to pick up 4 pieces of wings. This is the worst experience I've had with an establishment when they've messed up my order. I will not return to this place and do not recommend anyone to go here. I'm all about service at any restaurants I go to and working in the service industry that's a very important piece."}
{"text":"Fast service!!!

We were last minute trying to find something good to eat before heading to the airport, despite it looking busy (judging by the packed patio), we went in and were greeted & seated immediately! 

Our waiter was nice & very attentive! He came back to check on us often and made sure we had everything we needed. 

We ordered guacamole for an appetizer & chicken tacos for our main entree. They offer complimentary chips and salsa. The guacamole was fresh & very good, they are very generous with their portions - we couldn't even finish it. You definitely get your moneys worth! The tacos were good as well. Very filling. 

Overall prices were decent. 

It's a big and spacious restaurant! Located right off the The Strip. 

I'm happy we stopped by last minute!"}
{"text":"Sarah was fantastic, she took us on a culinary journey...nachos...tacos...margaritas...spicy salsa...her service was a cut above the rest...we were absolutely enamored with our meal...our only recommendation was that the chicken was SHREDDED chicken on the nachos...if you don't come here and ask for Sarah...well, you're just a fool"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Drinks, Vegas, What else can you ask for!
I can't believe this place has bad review.
Come on ppl, you're on the strip, drinks will be expensive and if you bought bad groupons, it's your fault for not reading the find print lol
Anyways...this was our last stop before heading home.
Had a drink to sober up ;) Cadillac margarita, strong enough to even us out!
We got sat right away, party of 8.
Our server was super cool and friendly. Even after a table walked out in her and left her with a $90 check. SO messed up. But who wouldn't be bummed after that? So it didn't matter to us. She knew everything about the menu and sold me the house special like it was gold on a plate haha did I regret it? NO. It was fish on top of dirty rice and this green sauce, which I call chimichurri back home. AMAZING combination of flavors.
Everyone was super satisfied with their food.
I'm not gonna lie, the kitchen did mess up on 2 orders but they also fixed a special plate for one of us.
Everyone mentioned the chips and salsa on their reviews and they are right! the salsa is just perfect and super addicting...
We got a super cute group pic taken by the photographer that works there, perfect to end our trip.
I had a great experience here and I will come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Server was horrible. Didn't tell us who he was, explain the menu, etc. Service was worse than Waffle House @3am. Food was EXCELLENT. Stay out of Erick M's section."}
{"text":"I would give this place no stars if I could.  This will go down as one of the worst dining/bar experiences I have ever had.  I like Sammy Hagar, I like patios and I like tequila, but there is nothing to like about this place.  Okay, maybe the patio for the simple fact that the people watching is great and it's a great location on the strip.  

I love food and I'm not ashamed of the fact that I like to get my grub on.  So, for me to leave a restaurant and NOT EAT MY FOOD really says something.  That is exactly what happened at this establishment.

A server took our drink order.  Ten minutes later, we got our water and beer.  Then, over 25 minutes went by before he came back for our food order.  No exaggeration.  All of this could have been overlooked had the server been nice (he wasn't) and/or the food been good (it wasn't).  It took an hour for us to get our order of nachos and fish tacos.  I ordered nachos because I thought, \"how do you screw up nachos?\"  Well, Cabo Wabo has found a way.  The nachos consisted of about 12 individual tortilla chips and each chip had this meat cheese crustiness.  The overall effect was dog food.  My nachos looked like dog food.  They had a really weird taste too.  And the fish tacos looked better but tasted equally bad.  We literally got our check and left without eating our food.  And left a 10% tip due to the bad service, even though it killed me to do it.

I enjoy a good tourist spot.  They're overpriced and a little cheesy, but sometimes I dig it.  If you want a good tourist trap, visit Margaritaville.  I've never had bad food or bad service there and that place is incredibly busy.  Oh, Sammy.  Why????"}
{"text":"Their CW Margarita is delish!  I like Sammy Hagar and I love his place.  We got the steak quesadilla, and while very rich, it was very tasty!  I can't say enough about the margarita though, it was great, I had to have another!"}
{"text":"It was actually a pretty quiet night when my wife and I came in here to eat. The outside portion of the restaurant was crowded and loud and we were initially reluctant to try it out but once we peeked inside it looked pretty sedate. So we decided to give it a shot.

We ordered the Grilled Top Sirloin Fajitas for two with beans and rice on the side. The food was really good. I enjoyed it a lot. I wish that they would bring more tortillas though. The waiter only brought three for each of us. We breezed through those pretty quick and had to ask for some more because there was still a lot of meat and veggies that we hadn't finished that we needed to wrap up. The waiter apparently expected that we would need more from the beginning because when he brought the food he told us to let him know when we needed more. Why wouldn't he have just given us more at the start? They should bring five tortillas per order, not three.

For a drink I had the Sammy's Toasted Colada which was a bit fruity for my taste. It was okay but I wouldn't order it again. I was a little bit disappointed with the drink menu. With the amount of sweet, fruity drinks they specialize in one would think that they might cater exclusively to Mexican Bachelorette parties. Everything seems to be rum (oh wait - Sammy's Beach Bar Rum), pineapple juice, coconut, and various fruity fillings. Not the manliest drinks.

I liked the quiet atmosphere (judging by previous reviews this seems to be a rarity here) and the food was good. Expensive, but good. There's no sense complaining about expense when you're in a place founded by a celebrity and it's on the Las Vegas Strip. Ni modo, as√≠ es la vida."}
{"text":"This is three stars for me personally. Four for the location and two for the food. It just was not my taste. I ordered the carne asada nachos. Next time I would not pay extra for the meat and just go with the beans on the nachos. My date had tortilla soup. It was very dark broth. He said it was okay but he was eating it because he ordered it not because he wanted it. Our waiter was great and very attentive. I wish I remembered his name to give him credit."}
{"text":"Excellent great tasting food, great atmosphere. Indoor and outdoor seating.  Lots of tv's. Great service."}
{"text":"My first experience with Cabo Wabo was purchasing a 32 oz. frozen margarita of my choice.

WARNING may get a little intoxicated.

My family and I were trying to decide where to eat for dinner and the decision was made to dine at Cabo Wabo. They have two separate host stations, one for outside seating and one for inside seating. The patio was going to take about a half hour wait so we decided to dine indoors. The had us wait for a few minutes to get our table set up. Once we were sat, we were greeted by a very friendly server, I believe her name was Sarah. Sarah was helpful, patient, and kind. She offered us suggestions and was very attentive. Sarah is exceptional.

One of Sarah's suggestions for a beverage was the MARGARITA VERDE [Cabo Wabo tequila, lime, freshly minced cucumber & cilantro, served on the rocks]. We ordered a pitcher $44 which serves about four full glasses; delicious and refreshing! For my dinner, I decided on the GRILLED PORTABELLA MUSHROOM FAJITAS [fajitas vegetable, guacamole, pico do gallo, sour cream & flour tortillas] $25.95 (for one); I had it served over melted cheeses skillet add $3.00 and a side of rice. The food was flavorful and well presented. My only negative critique is, not enough tortillas; you only receive three but an additional two would be better but that's a personal preference.

The music was really loud. it was hard to converse with my family or listen to Sarah, our server. Over all, my experience was exceptional and I definitely recommend dining at Cabo Wabo the next time you're in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"They don't even deserve one star. On the busiest day for Mexican Restaurants they failed to provide basic service. They sat us, a table of 9 at a table and got our order of drinks in. We then proceeded to wait an hour and a half until one of us went to the bar tender to get someone to take our order. We needed to leave on time so we asked for our check to come in early and prearranged hat it be separate. The bill came but not separate and before we had even received our food. The food finally came and we still had no silverware. They comped us chips and salsa for 2 hours of horrible service, due to lack of staff."}
{"text":"I'm from LA, so I know good Mexican food when I taste it... and this isn't it. Is it horrible? No, but nothing remarkable that's for sure. And the service? Horrible. 

Let's start from the beginning. Our party of four was crammed at a tiny table with tons of foot traffic. Some girl came over to take our order... not sure who she was, as she made it a point to tell us she was NOT our server but was going to be taking our order. Clearly she wasn't happy at being told to help out our actual server, as she was rude, surly, uninterested and completely unhelpful. 

When ordering, I said to her, \"How are the short rib enchiladas?\" I got a blank stare and she replied, \"they're good\" in such a way that I began to question my order and said, \"I'm not hearing any enthusiasm... should I order something else?\" She robotically replied with a sigh and said that she's never had them, but they are popular there. Um ok. 

Then, my friend who is a vegetarian, was told by the people at the front that almost everything on the menu could be modified into a vegetarian dish. (I mean, it's really not that difficult. Take any freaking dish and omit the meat and voila!) Rude girl taking our order: \"WHO told you that?!!\" and rolled her eyes and put her hands defiantly on her hips. Then she added, \"The ONLY vegetarian options are a cheese quesadilla or a salad!\" After being told what was said at the front, my friend asked if she could order cheese enchiladas with avocado and was told \"Oh, I guess you could do that.\" When our food came, no cheese enchiladas... but instead, a cheese quesadilla. ((SIGH)). The food runner was just as rude. My friend made the comment that it wasn't what she ordered but she'd eat it anyway. The runner insisted on getting the enchiladas as she barked, \"BECAUSE WE WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY!\" Lol.

And during the long period of time we were waiting for our food, I flagged down a server and asked for some chips and salsa. And as if this place didn't suck already, I was told they CHARGE for chips and salsa! What?!! Come again?? Never, ever in my life have I been to a Mexican restaurant (and I've been in a LOT in my time) and been charged for chips and salsa. I mean, I know we are in the price gouging capital of the world, Las Vegas, where dumb tourists will fork out any kind of money not knowing any better, but it will be a cold day in hell before I pay $5 bucks for chips and salsa. One week later, I'm still shaking my head as I write this.

Other than that, we never saw our server again... never checked on us, refilled water, nothing. The food was unremarkable. Average, at best. The mango picante margarita was pretty decent... took forever to arrive but tasted good. I was about 85% thru my meal when someone over my shoulder tried to take my plate away (wtf). And then for the remainder of our meal, there was a staff member table stalking us to fill our table the second we stood up, which was uncomfortable and we felt rushed (even though the service on their end was slow). 

Summary: Disappointed."}
{"text":"While some people would consider Cabo Wabo noisy, I thought it added to the ambiance and gave the place an electrifying atmosphere.  The food choices are plentiful, but the food itself is generally unimpressive.  For a Mexican restaurant not to have black beans, refried beans nor ground beef is inexcusable.  The server, Adam F., was excellent and helpful.  Overall, a nice experience, but one that can be beat food-wise."}
{"text":"My original review was flagged & removed by the moral police @ Yelp because I was too honest. I apparently included \"personal attacks\" by naming names at this God awful restaurant. I still, however want to put in my 2 cents about it. 

We had a $60 groupon that was apparently only able to be used by a party of 4 or more. This was written in the tiny print online only-nowhere printed on the groupon. The \"manager\" on duty was an ass. He immediately said he was going up to his office in order to print something out to prove us wrong. He was VERY condescending, attacking and just an all around awful person. The GM, who was not much better, cam down to us and finally agreed to take the $30 off that we paid for the groupon. The waitress was great and. Feel bad that she has to work for these nimrods. She had no clue that there was a per party requirement either, which again speaks to the (lack of) skill of these brilliant managers. 

I threw a fit with Groupon and got my money back. The chick on the phone did not sound surprised. Also-there were other tables having similar issues with their Groupons. 

Regardless-I'll never ever go back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, but food and drinks are just ok. I had the carne asada tacos,sangarita, and can't drive 55. The patio is perfect for people watching"}
{"text":"Place is super expensive. At $20 a plate they can at least bring some chips without charging extra. 

It's loud and big. If you can't get a patio seat consider just pushing on. 

However, the tortilla soup is amazing. The service was excellent. 

Fish tacos had great presentation and texture but low on flavor. Nachos were standard. 

I rated it 3 considering the price."}
{"text":"I came to Cabo Wabo to use a Groupon ($30 worth of food for $15) and because, frankly, I was intrigued by the schizophrenic Yelp reviews for the place. I had an early lunch around 11:30 am on a Wednesday and sat outside to watch people walk by on the Strip.

I had a pretty good experience at Cabo Wabo. The Cactus Pear Margarita was surprisingly tasty, and I'm not always a big fan of margs. I had the guacamole (not as great as some were saying, but pretty decent) and the jalapeno cilantro chicken. Nothing was spectacular, but nothing was terrible either.

To me, the big downer on Cabo Wabo is the price. But come on, it's right on the Las Vegas Strip - what do you expect? My drink, guac, and entree came to $34, so I used up my Groupon and then some. Between the price of the Groupon and the amount I paid in tax/tip, the whole experience ran me around $26. Without the Groupon it would have been $41, which seems awfully high for one person. However, Cabo Wabo does have a happy hour from 4-7 pm with half-price drinks and appetizers. I'd imagine that would be worth your time - if you can get a seat."}
{"text":"Went there with my friend and her SERVICE ANIMAL and got asked for service animal papers by the hostess . After telling her we don't have it as the law doesn't require it she became very rude about it. 

Needless to say we left

Perhaps, the staff should have been trained what to do when a customer walks in with a dog, or at least use a common sense."}
{"text":"Horrible food and service in outdoor patio! Really weird because we were here a couple years ago. Back then the food was better. Now you get tasteless tacos with canned beans and premade rice, gross! I've had better food at cafeterias! Took me 10 minutes to get my waiters attention just to try to get some hot sauce! Will never return here in Las Vegas again! HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"I ordered a taco salad and was surprised by how huge the portion was. It's a typical taco salad tossed with shredded nachos, Chedder cheese, and guacamole..nothing extraordinary. But if you're looking for a quick, non-fast food and inexpensive place to eat by the Strip, this would be a good place to stop by."}
{"text":"Mark & Christy best bartenders ever. They were way fun & made our day @ Cani wabo ! Thank you !"}
{"text":"No.

Obviously you don't have very high expectations when going to a place like this.. it's basically a glorified bar.. and this location is on the Las Vegas Strip...and to basically mimic what another reviewer said: the service was sloooow - and the food was GROSS. 

I ordered a 'chicken fajita burrito'.. which came to he table as a 'BEEF fajita burrito'.. about 35 minutes after it was ordered..AND it had CHILI all over it... like beef chili.. slopped over the top.. along with fake canned cheese.. which I guess would be fine, if that is what I had ordered.. and i was extremely drunk.  It was incorrect.. it looked unappealing.. but hey, I gave it a chance. Sufficed to say, I won't be going back for that particular menu item. (I did mention to the server that it was incorrect... he claimed they sent the wrong one, and I said I would deal with it.. but on the bill, it was listed as BEEF Fajita Burrito..as in.. he ordered the wrong item and lied to me about it.) Mistakes happen.. I get it... I'm just sayin.

The 2 friends I was with, both decided it was pretty bad service as there were missing utensils, drinks for the 3 of us were coming one at a time.. and there really seemed to be no excuse for the lack in service, because they were not at all busy.   We all agreed that the drinks weren't bad.. and the outdoor patio is a nice attraction to ''people watch' from .. but other than that.. I will not be eating any of their \"signature\" dishes again...ever. They had chicken tenders with fries on the menu, and if I ever visit this spot again to have drinks.. and decide that I am hungry (and very lazy, because there are 10 better choices less than 50 feet away, ) I will be having those. 

I don't recommend the food at all. The drinks were good and the Jeremiah Sweet Tea Vodka(?) Drink.. was tasty albeit very  sweet... but I did have 2! Anyway.. that's that.. good luck in your dining adventures!"}
{"text":"Despite the name, a bit expensive and mediocre, but well located on a busy section of the Strip.  Come here so you can sit outside on the large deck, otherwise it's not worth seeking out.

Despite the proudly featured margarita ads and the house tequila being top-shelf Cabo Wabo, they had no drink list, and minimally described only 3 tequila-based drinks (which are available frozen, mentioned first).  They seemed much more interested in selling us beer.

Tortilla soup was decently spiced, but a little too salty and a little too thick.

Service was attentive to a fault (checking in with us every 5ish minutes).

The location, however, is quite awesome-- at a major crosswalk, across the street from new Aria, with a view of the booming fountains at Bellagio.  Good for taking in the strip while having a drink, if you sit outside.  They have some gas heaters on the deck for the winter, but this sort doesn't seem to give off much heat.  Doesn't seem like there'd be a view from inside.

I've been to the original Cabo Wabo Cantina in Los Cabos, which has better pricing, drink specials, and much much more atmosphere, if much less of a view."}
{"text":"I was not impress with the food at Cabo Wabo Cantina Las Vegas . I went there with my friend, because we were super hungry and we were craving Mexican food. 
The portions are small and they are very, very pricy. 
We spend over $60 for 2 plates. 
Our waiter was nice, but still it wasn't worth it. I can get the same meal for $20 some where else."}
{"text":"My group, ten in all, found that all of our drinks seemed absent of alcohol.  This caused several of us to watch the bartenders pour, ultimately a waste of good money.  The overhead heaters close proximity to patrons was a concern, virtually cooking us all.  

Overall, the service was subpar.  The waiter treated us as if he was bothered with providing service and stated as a matter of fact that the tip will be no less than 18%."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, so are the waiters. Patio is usually crowded, but you can also eat inside. The patio is fun though because there is so much fun going on outside."}

{"text":"My husband and I decided to play \"tourist\" on the Memorial Day weekend.  We started to Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops.  While walking thru the shops, we decided to share a yard margarita.  (If we wanted to play tourists, we had to look the part!)  Fat Tuesdays had a line down the hall and around the corner!  So we thought we'd see what else was in the shops.  We thought we were lucky because just as we were about to walk out of the shops, Cabo Wabo Cantina appears with a margarita/daiquiri stand.  We end up getting the  1/2 yard with a strawberry margarita.  The first couple sips, neither of us said anything.  I didn't care for the drink so I stopped drinking it.  About 2 minutes later, my husband looks at me and says \"Doesn't this taste a little funny?\"   Yes!  It tasted like a watered down slushie/virgin margarita!  We decided to salvage the drink...went to ABC Store, bought Bacardi's Cherry flavor and poured a couple shots in there.  It tasted much better after that.  All and all...the drink cost over $30 (between the cost of the  1/2 yard at Cabo Wabo, tip, and ABC liquor purchase).  Will we go back?  Heck NO!  I'll wait in line at Fat Tuesdays or skip the drink next time.

PS:  This struck me as very strange....Our server at Cabo Wabo was counting her tips.  And not just quickly going thru the cash and then waiting on us.  She was pretending to be interested in us while she was counting out her money.  We told her our drink order and she gave us the \"deer in the headlights\" look with a blank smile!  She wasn't paying attention to one word we said!  We repeated our order, she recounted her money then got us our drink.  Not sure why it was so important to count her money so intensely but it was kinda weird!"}
{"text":"See Photo for Tequila Recommendation.

Came here twice this last year.  Location is nice.  

1st time: Food/Service for the food.....Not really that great.  I tried to eat here and left because the service was lacking.  Waters were not filled.  Food came cold and without condiments we needed like salsa and when we asked for it, the server forgot about us. 

2nd Time: They earned an extra star because of Groupon. They had a special for $15 for $30 worth of food or drinks. The best part was that for some reason Groupon only charged $1! I was like What??? I don't care how bad, the place was before...Dollar for drinks? I'm in. I purchased 2!  

Apparently it was some mistake, but Groupon honored it and I came armed with $30 to spend.  Went straight to the bar and got two $14 shots of tequila that came in a Worm shaped  bottle.

Smooooooooth. So if you come armed with the Groupon or not get the Tequila in the Worm Bottle. You will not regret it. Skip the food.  Hagar earned the extra star for the Worm Bottle Tequila Basically and the nice bartender.  Didn't have time to use the other Groupon on that trip...but Worm Tequila...I'm coming back for you!!!"}

It's good, I've never had a bad meal and the margaritas are really good, like really good.   It's a prime spot for people watching, good music and sometimes they have live bands ."}

Great spot to eat, drink, people watch, and listen to good music.  They had a DJ in the afternoon.   Will definitely be back here soon."}
{"text":"worst food ever. Even my boyfriend who will eat just about anything- did not finish his food. 
I paid $11 for a taco and enchilada, I ate perhaps two bites of taco and a third of my enchilada. NEVER again. Why does this place continue to get business?"}
{"text":"They don't honor the groupon that is out. I bought one of the $15 for $30 food and drinks. All they would give me is the $15 I originally paid. Don't buy the groupon, and you should not dine at a restaurant that pulls stuff like that. My server was decent and understanding of my situation."}
{"text":"Slushees in Vegas because who likes water? 
    Vegas slushees no matter where you go it's a must to get an extra shot. It was a nice place the girls at the front counter where awesome. You get to try a sample of all the flavors but it is recommended to mix them. 
     The drink itself kind of reminds you of a wine cooler with ice. So the collector cup is with the slushee is 24 and the extra shot makes it 29. 
      So I preferred the tacos and Rita's at the mgm had a groupon for a buy one get one. Way worth it to add  an extra shot on that and I definitely could taste the alcohol which is the whole point in buying the drink. 
     You end up throwing the big giant cup away when your finished because who has room for that in there luggage. 
     Might be a better option to buy a small one. 
So as far as the workers they were great and this place is pretty hip and trendy with outdoor seating across from the bellagio fountains."}
{"text":"BOMB FOOD! Omggggg let me tell you. Get the appetizer sampler with a beer of your choice and you won't be sorry! Everything was so delicious. We sat outside on the patio and had a front view of the Bellagio fountains. The sampler came with wings (most amazing sauce on them) quesadillas, taquitos, fries, and other things that I can't remember. Wish I took a picture. The guacamole was so creamy and fresh. The hot sauce (house made) was to die for. Perfect spice. Washed down with a cold beer... with a view... what is better??? I would def return here. Loved the ambiance and our server was the sweetest!!!"}
{"text":"I waiting 35 minutes to get a drink!, WTF, the waitress was complete lost I ask for another beer and she bring me the check lol, food was ok a little salt but was good."}
{"text":"Visiting on vacation and saw this cool outdoor Mexican place and thought I had to go. Went here with my bf and we sat on the ledge where you can people watch all the people walking by in Vegas.  The weather also wasn't too bad, great atmosphere.  Our waiter was nice and friendly.  I ordered the appetizer sampler and it was great! I loved everything on that plate.  My bf got shrimp tacos, and these were the first shrimp tacos I've tasted that actually weren't bland.  If I visit again, I will be returning!"}
{"text":"On my first trip to Vegas we decided to grab a bite to eat. Walking the strip we came across Cabo Wabo Cantina. It was packed, so we decided to see if there would be a wait. They girl said she would be able to seat our party ASAP. We approached the table and it WAS dirty, the girl quickly bused it though and had it wiped down. We decided to get a pitcher of the desert pear margarita. There was enough in the pitcher for two drinks each for the three ppl we had. It was pretty good but I didn't taste the desert pear really. I ordered steak fajitas while the other two in my party got a chimichanga and vegetarian fajitas (portobello mushrooms). The fajitas said they came with flour tortillas and the sever said he was willing to honor my request for corn. We also got chips and salsa for the table. While most of the food was in the $15-$30 range, Chips and salsa were $4! It was a huge serving and was very good! Our food came pretty quickly. The amount of food I had was enough for two ppl actually. I had enough left over to take back to the hotel to eat the next day. My meat was cooked and seasoned perfectly! I was a little disappointed that I only received three tortillas. Being Latina, I LOVE tortillas, so I wish I was given more. All in all, I enjoyed my meal and appreciated the prompt service and that our server was very helpful and attentive! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great place for good food & great drinks! The CW margarita was so good! I ordered the lobster enchiladas they were ok I probably wouldn't order them again though. I think the drinks are way better than their food. Also the music they play is great! Makes ya wanna get up & dance! We like going here for a chill experience which you will get!"}

We also ordered the nachos and chicken wings the nachos were very good I font know about the chicken wings cause my wife had one wing and noticed a hair in her plate and lost her appetite we sent it back they were kind enough to take it off our bill needless to say it was not the Mexican food we are used to here in southern Cali would I go back to Vegas of corse to wabo Cabo don't think so"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here the day after our wedding and it was super busy for lunch. The service was terrible. Also this place gave my husband food poisoning and he spent the rest of our honeymoon in the bathroom and ruined our trip. He ordered the chicken tacos. I tell everyone that goes to vegas to avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"It is not my first time here, nor I have personal feelings towards this place. 

HOWEVER, Anthony was probably one of the worst server I have had in any service industry. I really did not want to mention his name, because it would ruin his day once he reads this review; however, I thought he might be better off knowing why this review had to be written. 

The hostess promptly took us to the patio seating on a Thursday night. Anthony did not approach to our table for about 10 minutes. Once he came, we were not really sure what we wanted, but he seemed to just want to rush us. He never greeted us, nor smiled. He just gave me an impression that we were not welcomed at all. 

Then, we ordered a pitcher of margarita, chicken taquitos and carnitas tacos. A food runner brought out the food. We asked for napkins to this guy, and he never brought us. We ended up asking our server, Anthony, and he actually brought us the napkins and hot sauce right away- which was one good thing he did for us. Then, we were eating and chilling there. We were about done with our food and drinks, deciding whether we were going to order more or not; however, Anthony approached to our table, and without saying a single word, he started taking away all plates and cleaning up our table. HORRIBLE. We are literally thinking what to order next, and he just decides to make us a reason to get out. 

We just ended up getting out of the restaurant. I know strip food can suck, but the only reason why a local resident would come out to the strip and pay extra money for bad food is because they got nice ambiance and proper service; however, Anthony did not even get the basics right. I would never go back to this spot, just because they have failed me so bad last night."}

I'm sure if it had been nice out, sitting on the Strip-side patio would have at least been good people watching!"}

It was a cold night so we were glad they had heaters nearby. There was live rock music that night so we basically got dinner and a show! I ordered the green veggie burrito and my husband ordered the Asada tacos. He was very happy with his tacos but wished there was a larger portion. What he got was only fit for an appetizer! Our bill came out to be a bit pricier than we anticipated but I am sure that it being in the strip in a Vegas is going to drive up the cost. Service was good and the music was entertaining so we can't complain much!"}

The location is awesome, with a great view of the Bellagio fountains which our daughter loves. So we get there and I ask the hostess if we could get a seat outside in the front. She doesn't smile, isn't pleasant one bit and asks, well, are you going to be eating?  Um, what do you think we came here to just sit at lunchtime?  She stands there looking puzzled for about 20 seconds, then finally took us to the seats without saying anything.  The waiter was cool but man, the food sucked - I had burrito and hubby had combo plate.  He asks for spicier salsa... we charge extra for that... jalapenos?  we charge extra for that.... really? You're charging 14 bucks for a burrito and you can't throw us some lousy jalapenos??  Never coming here again that's for sure... terrible hostess, terrible food at high prices."}

The food was pretty good, though I could have used some hot sauce.  Overall, it was a good experience."}

I will not be returning here."}

Ceviche tasted not so good.  Nachos were OK.

N ow let's talk about the performer (deep eye roll).  He's sitting there playing a guitar and singing, wanting audience participation.  I think a lot more people would have been enthusiastic had this idiot not racially profiled a table with some Asian folks.  His first question to them was \"do you speak english?\"  Seriously... he made it that much worse by making lite of his comment, and acknowledging that he racially profile.  Disgusting!!!   He wanted them to move out that table cause.... well who knows why, he just did.  However the next set of folks that say there, he didn't ask them about the language they spoke, nor did he ask them to leave.

To start off, we ask to be seated by the heater and where did we get seated... not near the heater. Uhhh, did you not hear us?!  It was a cold Saturday night so when we saw open space by the heater, we decided to scoot our table ourselves. 

I ordered the mushroom fajitas plate- I wouldn't recommend it. Partly my fault because after ordering it I realized how delicious can mushroom fajitas be?! And partly because the mushrooms were flavorless. It was not marinated and grilled that well.

Our server explained the breakfast menu and was very detailed on what to expect if we came back for breakfast. Great ambience and decor we really enjoyed the lunch experience and we would come back and recommend anyone looking for a good lunch spot in LV to come and visit."}
{"text":"I have a feeling I would've liked this place better before I stopped drinking; oh well.  Ended up grabbing lunch inside as it was a windy day.  Bottom line, food was really pretty good, no complaints amongst the group and I liked my Carne Asada Burrito well enough.  It's Vegas and on the strip so it's overpriced and all, but that's to be expected.  What one shouldn't have to settle for is poor or slow service.  Lunch took well over an hour, about 2/3 of which passed after our food arrived; the waiter just disappeared.   Additionally, they seated us at the table in front of the door to the deck, which would've been find except that remember we sat INSIDE becasue of the wind.  So every time they opened the door, it would slam back against the wall and the rush of wind would blow everything off the table, Took 3-4 instances of this and a few parties complaining before they figured out not to use that door and divert to a door closer to the bar.  Better values and equally good food to be had in the Miracle Mile if you find yourself at PH.

Also, although I am not a drinker, I did use the free Maragarita with a Yelp check in to score a drink for my buddy.  This seemed to confuse both the server and the manager ( the Yelp coupon, not the Margarita). Seems like it would be a good idea to  make sure your employees know your offers on social media!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was really cool - almost felt like we were in Mexico! They were very very busy and our server was nice. 
The portions are kind of on the small side. Hubby got the huevos rancheros (smallest I have ever seen) and I got the breakfast burrito. There wasn't  a lot of flavor to either of them so  we added some hot sauce, and ordered Guac and salsa. The Guac didn't have much flavor either but the salsa was great. 

They also gave us a free house  margarita because we unlocked it on yelp but it was warm!! Blah!"}
{"text":"Horrible.

Went to watch a UFC fight this past weekend, do NOT waste your time. Yes, it was cheaper than other places, but it was not worth it. I was told i was going to get a table and when i came back to check on my table i was told there was only standing room. They allowed way too many people in. People were sitting on the stairs and standing everywhere! Including in my way.

The food was awful. It tasted like a tv dinner mexican food. 

And on top of all this, i almost got smacked in the head by bus boys bringing in tables and chairs for all the extra people they let in.

The plus side? the waitress was really nice."}

We walked around 10- almost 11pm & one of our friends pointed this place out. I asked if we can keep walking to find a better place but we were too famished we just had to stop. Very depressing it had to be this place. If you're hungry & walk by, keep going. There are better places to eat and drink in this desert. Drinks were decent, service was terrible, food was worse. We all took a few bites & left the food at the table. For the price you pay, this place needs to be ashamed. Don't even think about it, just skip this dump!!!"}

She spotted Cabo Wabo Cantina outside of Planet Hollywood, across from where we were standing in front of the Cosmopolitan. 

We head over to Cabo Wabo we were immediately seated on the patio facing the strip (choice of indoor or outdoor seating). We enjoyed people watching, some in their costumes collecting tips for a pic. Some were very creative like Olaf whom looked like a Cholaf, a Mickey Mouse regect, 2 minions and a couple Egyptian guys. 

Our server comes by and takes our order. I ordered the carne asada plate and my friend orders the carnitas burritos. While waiting we're snap chatting away and I check in on YELP --- 1 FREE MARGARITA woot woot!
Then 2 old men get seated next to us - and they were the same old men that wanted to take photos with us when we were at Bellagio. LOL it was funny... we should have gotten a tip for pic.

Any ways, our food arrives and we killed it!! Not cz we were super  hungry cz it was delicious!!! Yummm... the rice, beans and carne asada (3) were just perfect. I've started to appreciate avocados and my carne asada tacos had a slice on each one... made me super happy!

They had a live band playing behind us (more like a solo band). He was really good. He played his guitar maybe it was a Ukele and he was singing live robin thicke, Bruno mars, flo-rida, etc. He sang his version of the songs added a hint of Hawaiian island beat to it. I loved it! 

Our server was ok ((less the one star)) She was nice to my friend and I but rude to the old guys sitting next to us. They would call her and say \"excuse me, excuse me\" she looks at them and keeps walking. RUDE! I felt so bad cz all he wanted was a cup of coffee. - Maybe cz he was smoking in the patio and no smoking was allowed. He probably didn't know, there wasn't a sign or anything. 

Well this place is good for entertainment, food was good, vibe was great!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! They have super fun frozen drinks and there wasn't much of a wait at all if you are willing to sit inside.

I had the Ahi tuna burrito, it was absolutely delicious. I was with four friends and they all really loved their food too. One got shrimp fajitas and it came with a ton of shrimp!! 

The only reason I am only giving them three stars is because our waiter was AWFUL. He wasn't friendly at all and made us feel like we were inconveniencing him when we asked for anything. 

I get that most of the people that go in are tourists so they don't need to be friendly to ensure repeat business but a little smile goes a long way.

Overall, the food and margaritas are totally worth putting up with the crappy service."}

Both of our plates came with beans and rice, which were both flavored nicely. The Drinks are very potent so beware. We are from New Mexico and we know flavor, so Cabo Wabo Cantina food passes our taste test. Servers are attentive and gracious. Will definitely return next time we are back in Vegas."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick snack and a margarita...and were pretty underwhelmed.

We sat outside on the patio in the bar area, and our server was friendly, but the overall atmosphere was not what we expected.  The bar area itself was pretty unkempt with used glasses and half-eaten baskets of chips strewn about, but our table itself was not that dirty.  The flatware and appetizer plates, however, matched the decor of the bar and we had to ask for new sets twice before settling on some that we could use.  

We both had a regular margarita made with Patron silver on the rocks, and while they were not overly sweet, the taste of tequila was pretty negligible.  Since it was hot out, they still tasted good, but not good enough to order more than one.  After getting our drinks, we tried an order of the Chips, Salsa & Guacamole from the appetizer menu, and an order of the ceviche.  The guac was pretty good (but lacked salt), and we liked the salsa, but the seafood in the ceviche was definitely not \"cooked\" all the way.  I would say stick to the easy to prepare items on the menu as far as food goes (the ceviche should be a hard pass), as the focus seems to be more on quantity and not quality.

Also worth noting is that when we asked for our check, our friendly server suddenly turned into our SLOW server, and it took more than 15 minutes for her to just run our card.  I would recommend paying with cash if you can, as it seemed like a few other tables around us were riding on the same train of frustration when it came time to pay.

Overall, there are better spots to grab a quick drink and a good bite to eat, but if you do stop in here, try the inside dining area for a more enjoyable dining experience.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went here after seeing a show at planet hollywood and the atmosphere is upbeat with music and people but the food is just ok. We ordered carnitas tacos, carne asada tacos, chicken enchiladas, lobster enchiladas and as an appetizer we got the rolled chicken taocs. For all 4 of us we weren't impressed with anything but it wasn't terrible either."}
{"text":"We had the most wonderful experience here. The view and the food were both fantastic. The service was excellent and I have 0 complaints about our time here."}
{"text":"This is a perfect spot for hangover food especially if you stay at the Cosmo.
Good food, big portions, great service, it's a win win. Not pricey at all."}
{"text":"I decided to take my wife to @CaboWaboLV for an early Valentine's dinner since she is the biggest @Sammy_Hagar fan & has been dying to check this place out since it opened. 

Before going I did my homework and read all the reviews that had been posted. After reading I was really surprised this place is still OPEN. Not too many good things being said. 

We arrived on Friday night around 10pm and the house band had just started playing. Acoustic Soul-Las Vegas' Original & Only LIVE Jukebox. They play all requests-some good some NOT so good. 

We were seated immediately with no wait even though the place was packed including the outdoor patio bar. 

The menu is mexican food with a baja twist. VERY Pricey. We ordered Beef Fajita Nachos to start-The Carne Asada Entree & a 3 item combo with Hard & Soft shell tacos and a cheese enchilada. Ice Water all around. NO drinks this time:) 

(However they did pour FREE shots of tequila when the band played \"Mas' Tequila\") 

The service was a little slow it took nearly 30 minutes before we saw the appetizers and we spent most of the night chewing on ice. 

The nachos were very underwhelming-10-12 soggy chips covered in cheap shredded cheese and sparse bits of beef fajita meat. 4 melonballer size scoops of (lettuce,pico,sour cream & guac) NO seasoning, no spice, no flavor just cheese. The complimentary chips & salsa are a much better choice. 

NEXT, the entrees came out- The carne asada plate covered w/cheese, onions and jalapenos. a couple tortillas and a plate with (lettuce,pico,sour cream & guac). NO salsa!! Again with the cheap shredded cheese and the jalapenos were not even cooked just sliced and covered in cheese. 

The fajita onions & peppers were way too much compared to the skimpy 8oz carne asada steak. The steak like the nachos had NO seasoning or flavor. FOR $20 at a bar I was really expecting something phenomenal. 

The 3 item combo of beef tacos and cheese enchilada was alright except for the cheese enchilada which again used the cheap shredded cheese which didnt melt well at all and was tasteless. 


The lack of seasoning for a mexican resataurant is really unacceptable and NO salsa with entrees no beans with the chips appetizer. :( 


For 2 people to have an appetizer and 2 entrees-drink ice water and get slow service for $65 pretty disappointing to say the least:("}
{"text":"Not a terrible place, but not a great place either. I came here with my sister who came a year before and said \"don't expect much from the food but they have strong margaritas\" Well I hate margaritas but i ordered one anyway because, well, I'm in Vegas. 

The rita was ok, i don't remember the food but it was a nice place, just not my kind of people, we did go back but only because we were staying there and we saw a concert there. the patio was the best part of this place because you can sit over the strip and people watch."}
{"text":"Made a weekend trip out to Vegas for my Best friends birthday and stopped here for a cold beer and appetizer. By far the best choice we made since we have been here. I gave this place 5 stars due to our server Danny. Not only did he provide great customer service but he was very friendly, did a great job of informing us of the specials that weren't on the menu and was just all around very personable. Danny sold us on getting the trio ceviche platter which included ah√≠ tuna, shrimp and red snapper. The best ceviche I've had hands down and the seasoned chips that came with it were amazing. Been to a lot of places to eat and I can honestly say that Danny is the best server we've encountered. It's employees like him that make people want to come back! Great experience!"}
{"text":"The food was not that good; I ordered the Chicken Fajitas and chicken was dry, re-fried beans were yuk (canned re-fried beans would have been tastier). Service was okay but our drinks went dry twice before anyone came over to refill. 

Great atmosphere if you have an opportunity to sit out on the patio overlooking the strip. Order the Chips & Salsa and a drink and that would be the best experience of this place."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing service ! My waitress whitney is so much fun! I can't wait to come back! The mimosa was delicious, had the croissant French toast it's to die for ! Seriously Whitney was amazing her and her friends were so much fun !"}
{"text":"Normally I'd give this place a 3.5-4 star but today I was snapped at by the server & over charged! We had 2nd drinks on us coupons because Cabo Wabo was closed for a party. They gave these coupons as an I'm sorry. I had 2 margaritas, husband had 2 bud lights. Should've been 1 margarita & 1 beer charged,  1 margarita & 1 beer free... NO!!! They charged me for 2 margaritas=more expensive drinks & gave me the lower priced beers free. How is this 2nd drink on us? We had 2 coupons... this is absolute crap! I do love their outdoor patio over the strip, wish they had live music more often. Food is good but $$$ but then it is ON the strip. Just should've not snapped at me & given me a dirty look then over charged me. Not happy with our visit today AT ALL!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. You get what you pay for. I ordered the Jack and Coke Ribs. Sooo much food. Full Rack of ribs, corn on the cobb and fries for $24. 

They had decent drink specials. But Fat Tuesdays was calling our name."}
{"text":"Amazing food, superior service, fantastic drinks, unique location--had a blast,  will be back!"}
{"text":"I love Cabo Wabo! The waitress Aia is so awesome. Very friendly and great at her job! Would definitely come back here. Food is tasty, drinks are strong, and the people watching can't be beat."}
{"text":"We made our first visit to Cabo wabo this past weekend. We were able to get right in and seated quickly. Service was friendly and fast. The food portions are huge. We could have easily shared a meal. My mom ordered the jack and coke ribs (it's a full slab, but they don't tell you!!!) and I ordered the portabello mushroom fajitas. Both entrees were good, but I favored my mom's jack and coke ribs. The ribs were tender and the flavor was phenomenal. The portabello fajitas were good as well. We did not think the prices were outrageous as others have claimed. It's the Las Vegas strip, unless you eat at McDonalds there are not really any \"cheap\" places to eat.  We did purchase a Groupon but would eat there again without one."}
{"text":"Awesome experience here!  Ask for Ashley T. The service is top notch and very friendly!  If you love people watching, this is your mecca!"}
{"text":"Me and my friends visited here from LA and this place on the strip attracted us instantly. We had awesome service and an amazing waitress! Her name was Liz and we had no idea what to order, so she recommended the shrimp cocktail and it was bomb! Exactly what we wanted. She kept us laughing the whole time, and made us feel welcome. I definitely recommend visiting this joint, and asking for Liz because she was the cherry on top of this awesome restaurant!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly great food. I expected it to be overpriced and overhype's but the nachos had outstanding flavor. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is getting one star for the location and one star for the mediocore chips and salsa. I actually wish I could give half a star for those. A restaraunt usually can't disappoint me when I am starving and hungover but Cabo Wabo managed to do that. Congrats!

For the love of god, please don't come here. The food was so bland and terrible and the service is even more horrid. First off, I am pretty sure our server had tourette's. Not that there is anything wrong with that, I just feel like you should be warned before having to go through that.

I had been walking on the strip for a while before getting to the restaraunt so I was totally parched.  We were seated and no one acknolwedged our presence for 10-15 minutes so I had to get up and go to the bar and ask for water. Tourette's server finally came to see us but he was seriously a hot mess. 

Ok, let's be honest, I don't know if homeboy actually had tourette's or if he was just having a bad night but every time he walked by our t"}
{"text":"wow, only 2.5 stars? I guess it all depends on the individual experiences + what are you looking for.

4 stars for the amazing and scrumptious large-portioned tostada salad. The Cobb salad was pretty good too, very light, huge portions. The bf ordered a fajita however and it was so-so, very meh.

Service was friendly I thought. The waiter even asked if I was 21 then gave me tickets for free drinks.

And it wasn't that loud, during the day/lunch hours at least.
For a quick lunch, why not."}
{"text":"Okay for Mexican. Booked because of how close it was to J lo! Fajitas were average but the real star was Sammy's Tequila Shrimp! Sammy Hagar seems like Guy Fieri with a guitar."}
{"text":"I came here for appetizers and drinks before seeing Britney at PH with some friends. We were short on time so opted to sit at the bar since there was a 30 minute wait to be seated on the patio. The nachos were SO GOOD!!!! Since we just did apps I can't comment on the entrees but the frozen margarita pitcher was tasty as well. Good vibes and friendly service. I will definitely be back for those nachos the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Overall a decent place to grab a drink and quick bite. Fajitas were good, beers cold. Only ate there due to lines everywhere else. Not exactly the Cabo like Mexico, more of a chain feel. Service was good. No live music anymore.....minus a star...
...."}
{"text":"The location is the perfect place to take a break from walking the strip. The atmosphere is fun! The food was very good and the service was amazing. After our meal we had a few drink and just sat and people watched."}
{"text":"First of all this place is WAY too loud. Don't get me wrong, there is a time & a place to crank it up...like my car...but when you give up completely on trying to talk to the person NEXT TO you (NOT ACROSS) because the screaming you've been trying isn't working...it's time to go down a decibel or 2.

Second, the tables and chairs are made of wood. And, 13 hours later, my a$$ still hurts! No joke. I have never been more uncomfortable at a restaurant ever.

Third, the service. I was in a large party and there was one girl taking care of us w/o help and she did a fantastic job. No one's order got messed up, drinks kept coming (she kept track of what everyone was drinking). She rocked it.

And, lastly, the food. As is pretty typical of the Strip, the food was just OK and WAY overpriced. Portions were slightly on the small side. I had a chicken soft taco which was mediocre at best for $7. It was pretty flavor less. Husband got carnitas something which had rice, beans, and big chunks of pork. He gave it a B. He had soda and I had water. The bill came to almost $30.

Honestly, the only reason I saw the inside of this place was because of the group function I attended. I most likely won't eat here again.

There are literally 50 different Mexican places in LV I would have been happier to eat at for 1/2 the price. Chipotle has is all over this place!! Sammy shouldn't have quit his day job!!"}
{"text":"Nice casual place to have good margaritas. Food is good too. House margaritas not so good however cw margaritas are great!"}
{"text":"I am writing this for the Cabo Wabo in the Las Vegas Airport. Wow, with hours to kill at America's most skanky airport, what else is there to do but drink? My lady and I decided to get a marg at the Red Rocker's lair on an extended layover between flights. I ordered the signature drink, the \"Cabo Wabo,\" while my wife ordered the \"I Can't Drive 55.\" As somewhat of a mixologist myself I must say that the drinks were subpar but what do you expect from a crummy chain restaurant at the airport? But upon receipt of the bill  we immediately renamed it \"Cabo Robbo.\" 35 bucks for two lousy, no-tequila, corn syruppy \"margaritas?\" Unfortunately for us, the menu did not have prices but we figured 10 bucks max, not 15. If there had been even an ounce of tequila in the drinks I would not be hating on this business so much. Cabo Wabo deserves to die.

Here's a poem I wrote about it:
Cabo Robbo 
(Sung to the tune of Van Halen's Cabo Wabo)
I've been to Taos; Austin, Texas
Man, I thought I'd seen it all
Around the world, workin' my passport
Man, I thought I'd hit the wall

There's a crappy bar, at Las Vegas Airport
It's called Cabo Robbo cantina and bar
Made me want to file a health report
You know I wanna punch Sammy Hagar

If you go there once, it' won't suffice
Lots of crappy drinks, tasting like bleach
The blue syrup sure makes them look nice
But once you taste one, you wanna screech

We gotta try a shitty bar, called the Cabo Robbo
It ain't alright by me
Come on, let me take you down
The biggest rip off you ever seen
Like a slot machine but more rundown

McCarran Airport, you'd have to see it man
Ain't no picture ever say it right
Walkin' the concourse dodging Nascar fans
Place is filled with scroungy 'Merkans, what a sight?!?
I wanna catch my flight.

You know I wanna get back to Frisco
It ain't all right there
Wish the fog would lift at SFO
Everyone here looks like they eat Crisco

Come on, let me take you down
I will show you around
Let me take you down
The biggest rip off you ever seen
Over the barrel at the Vegas airport"}
{"text":"I ate here with my husband and 2 sisters in law earlier this month. We got the table right in the corner by the street, which was great for people watching. We all really liked our food and our waitress was fantastic. The only downfall was not enough shading, causing us to maneuver the table and chairs so we were all mostly covered from the blistering sun. It was pretty expensive as well, but that is Vegas for you."}
{"text":"First of all, my friends and I are locals. We knew about this place and we were hoping they might have some Cinco de Mayo specials or at least some good Mexican festive music. Nope, the joint was blasting their tinny-sounding MP3 music on impressive looking speakers. (waste of good speakers)

So we went out of our way to get here and park so might as well stay a while. I had a feeling our bill was going to be outrageous in the end, but it *IS* the strip so what do you expect. Sort of wish we went to Casa Don Juan but I was overruled. The service we received was actually pretty decent, especially considering how busy it was on a Sunday late afternoon on Cinco de Drinko. Our server was Ashley and she was really sweet, very on top of things so I have no complaints about service. 

We had a party of 5, and we only had to wait maybe 10 or 15 minutes to get seated inside. I ordered a margarita verde which had some cucumbers in it and it was pretty decent, even if it was an overpriced $12, again, it's the Strip. My bf had a couple of regular margaritas, and my friend ordered the \"special\" margarita which was $20 and you kept the glass. It was a frozen drink and was a pretty big size. She said it was good but on the sweet side. 

My boyfriend and i shared some nacho platter (no meat) and we thought they were really delicious, I was quite surprised especially after seeing such bad reviews on the food. The nacho sauce was really good... and it had plenty of super *hot* jalapenos. We ate it all, it was an enormous portion but I was satisfied with paying $15 for it. My friend ordered an avocado burger which she liked. I think our other friends got shrimp ceviche and beef taquitos. No one complained, and we had been there for at least 2 1/2 or 3 hours. 

I had two margaritas and the bf had 3 margaritas, plus the nachos, and our total came to a whopping $82!!!!! HOLY. COW. The kicker though....  they sneak in this \"CNF\" charge which was I think 3.5% of the bill. It was around $2.70 on ours anyway. We questioned the fee and the waitress said she \"didn't know what CNF stood for, but it was something the casino or the mall made them pay because they had to pay for rental space there??!!!\" WHAAAAAA...? It wasn't a very good explanation. Since when does something like that get absorbed by the customers, isn't that the cost of doing business on the miracle mile? Just another Strip ripoff. We didn't make a big deal out of it with her but we weren't very happy with the extra charge. Probably not coming back here anytime soon. The reason for the stars rating is because of the prices and the ripoff CNF charge, come on, management, really!?"}
{"text":"Below average Mexican at exhorbitant prices. The beer came in a plastic cup. The only thing worthwhile was sitting outside overlooking the strip."}
{"text":"Oh Cabo Wabo! I honestly can't say anything bad about this restaurant.  I came here Sunday night as this was one of the bars for my Las Vegas Club Crawl. The drinks were very good and strong just like I like it! 

I seen people eating but didnt pay to much attention to it since my main mission was to drink and have a good time.

The next day I woke up and all I could think about was Cabo Wabo! I was trying to find good Groupon deals and spotted Cabo Wabo had a $15 for $30 worth of food. I was like two tears in a bucket, f*** it! We're going to Cabo Wabo!

It's walking distance from the Caesars Palace. Once I got there we were seated immediately outside near the heaters as it was very cold outside. I liked sitting outside on the patio because your able to see the water show from where your seating and eating. 

The nice attractive server Stephanie asked us if we wanted to start off with a beverage and i instantly said margarita please! ;). Dont forget to check in to get your free margarita! 

Everything on the menu looked good especially after looking at the pictures on Yelp. I ordered the appetizer of chips and salsa which was not expensive at all $3.95 you can not beat that especially for the amount that you get!

For my entree, I decided on the shrimp tacos and double rice since I'm not into the beans. I was very hesitant in ordering the chicken enchiladas because it looked very good as well but after talking to the server Stephanie she let me know that the shrimp tacos was a better choice. 

Babe ordered a burrito which came with nacho chips on the side which were very good! The cheese that they use for their nachos were a plus!

I also liked that the drinks were very strong and tasty! They know exactly what to do to get you to buy more than one lol.

 I would definitely recommend this if you're in the area of the miracle mile shop and looking for something to eat. They had many different things on their menu with a lot of good varieties you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This spot is centrally located on the strip right in front of Planet Hollywood.  What an awesome spot to people watch and just take in Vegas!  The outdoor seating always keeps cool thanks to the many misters strategically scattered about the deck.  Great spot for tequlia--obviously, and the bartenders are always friendly.  Food was pretty decent here.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here before a show and was highly disappointed! As everything is in Vegas the food was overpriced and the quality was extremely bad. Tortillas that were brought out for fajitas were at least a week old and were very elastic. TERRIBLE!"}
{"text":"We went to breakfast here with excitement for the bottomless mimosas. However, the \"bottomless\" mimosas were only refilled once and that was after having to ask our waitress for another. 

We were surprised to see low prices compared to virtually every other restaurant in Vegas. But, when the food came- it became clear why. The food was marginal at best."}
{"text":"The place was dead at 11pm last night so we assumed this is a daytime place?

The waitress was attentive but we had to track her down at the end to get our bill.

The nachos with chicken were good with a delicious Queso sauce. (about $14)

We also got the Taquitos which were okay. 

The weekly special was a $7.50 Fireball shot but I got the Key Lime Pie martini was too milky, strong, and sweet.

Overall, this is a good place to get a quick bite and drink if there is no wait."}
{"text":"Meh. I got the Mexican Chopped Salad and added grilled shrimp for $6...I received FOUR SHRIMP! The salad tasted not very fresh. The best thing about this place is the location and the outdoor seating right on the strip. That's about it."}
{"text":"I'm shocked that the food at this corporate-merchandising tourist trap was quite good.  Ya gotta love Sammy Hagar, but I despise chains, for the most part.  

I noticed that recent reviews are stellar, yet overall the ranking is mediocre for this establishment.  Based on my experience, they definitely must have cleaned house and changed up the menu/management.  My cilantro jalape√±o chicken entree was delicious.  

Sit outside if it isn't too hot.  It's across from the Bellagio fountains and a massive people-watching opportunity."}
{"text":"We were very surprised by this place. Looks like just a bar when you walk by. We stopped in for breakfast on Saturday morning 9/23/17. Waffles were very good, egg plate with bacon was also very good and omelettes were on point."}
{"text":"We had 2 different margaritas and salad here. Both were good but the margaritas seemed kind of watered down. I really enjoyed the carne asada southwest Cobb salad, it was light and I didn't leave feeling over full like you can in a lot of Vegas restaurants."}
{"text":"We came here because we were starving, and looking for mexican food. Well, we really messed up picking this place.

There's a patio area and then the area inside. We decided to eat inside, even though the girl told us there was karaoke going on inside. Big mistake. We stepped into deafening noise. The \"DJ\" there thought he was the funniest, cutest thing, but he was actually just obnoxious. The only people there doing karaoke were his friends and family. Like, his mom and shit. What was funny is he had a laptop to DJ. And he was shit at it. He would blast a song during every interval, and then act all flustered cause he had \"so many people to get through\" that night. There were two people besides us that weren't his family. Too loud and too annoying.

Also, the cooks didn't take the wrapper off of my fiance's cheese and put it on his burger. WTF. And the waiter was a jerk. I finished my water and ate my ice, and he brought out 3 more waters, I guess to be funny? I finished it because you didn't bring my drink within 10 minutes. Then he randomly stopped by and left his own personal drink on our table. wtf wtf wtf. Never again."}
{"text":"Good job!  Four of us had dinner.  The four different dinners were elegantly prepared and served soon after we ordered.  Will go back.  Check out the Margarita offer if you are a member of Yelp."}
{"text":"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas  ...unless it's delicious happy hours chicken taquito and mixed (watered down) shots!  The flavor was reminiscent of delicious but the chicken was a bit scorched on either ends."}
{"text":"The food is not good enough for the price, but that's what you get when you're on the strip.
A little inappropriate that the hostesses call one of the managers \"Big Daddy\" but I guess that's not my business.I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Came in tonight for my friend's 21st birthday. We drove 4+ hours today to enjoy his celebration and this was one of the first stops we made and we were NOT impressed. The hostess was very friendly and helped us out with finding a seat outside. Once we were sat, our server took a look over our ID's. We are all from Arizona and have the SAME driver licenses. Our server took one the ID's and had told us that she couldn't serve our friend because her I.D wasn't an exact replica. It was a real license. I asked to speak with the manager(crystal) TWICE... and she definitely took her time to come approach us. Once she did, she responded that she couldn't do anything about it.  I told her I would be a cop into  It and she simply replied \"Do whatever. These are my policies\" we closed out our tab immediately. Extremely upset with the way this place handles things. Never coming back again.   
Do not recommend this place"}
{"text":"Last night in Vegas was awesome. My cousin and I had a great time eating here the food was good but the service was amazing! Danny was awesome! Thank you for the wonderful service and great ambience."}
{"text":"Found our go to restaurant in Vegas when visiting the mall or going to the hypnosis show. I loved the steak quesadillas...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stay away! This restaurant is the epitome of the shitty overpriced food that the Strip is well-known for. I dined here based on the recommendation of a friend who said that the atmosphere of the restaurant was lively and entertaining. However, they had never actually dined there themselves. I did them a solid and told them to avoid this place at all costs.

My main motivation for choosing this spot was that it is directly across the street from my hotel (Cosmopolitan). While the service and atmosphere were fairly pleasant, the food was a downright letdown. My sister and I ordered two cappuccinos, carne asada tacos, and guacamole. Everything was at most mediocre in taste with the exception of the carne asada tacos. Those came with a side of rice and beans which were absolutely disgusting to the point where I couldn't get myself to finish them. The beans were stale and lacking in flavor. They literally tasted as if they had been left out sitting for an hour or so. Gross! The rice tasted as if it had come directly from a box and soaked in tomato sauce. This may fly for unsuspecting patrons whom have never had the distinct pleasure of having a solid plate of rice and beans, but no sir, not me. It was pitiful. Not only that, but I really do believe I got food poisoning from that disgusting food. What an absolute disappointment. Not only did this restaurant shaft me with their overpriced, subpar food, but they also caused me to have severe stomach pains (I'll spare you the details) for the rest of my trip. Avoid this place if you want to be able to enjoy Vegas."}
{"text":"Outstanding fish tacos. Sat on the patio under the heated umbrellas watching the water show across the street from the Bellagio. My friend always gets the shrimp tacos because they are her #1 choice. Definitely check this place out if you want great ambience on the strip to eat. We ate at midnight I think."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the chips & salsa were tasty, not spicy. I ordered two margaritas, one with cucumber and cilantro (refreshing and not too sweet) and the other was a mango and jalape√±o margarita (way too sweet and thick for me). I enjoyed my experience and soaked up the sun for 2 hours. It's a great place to just chill and enjoy a refreshing drink."}
{"text":"Good food, great drinks. I especially love walking in and seeing/hearing everything rock n roll around the place. The couple of times I've been here there has been very good service and no complaints about the food or anything. In fact, one time I went they were doing a special where you got a free frozen margarita (with Cabo Wabo tequila, the house favorite) with an entree order. This was during the summer, so I'm not sure when it will be back, if at all. I always order the Sopas con Carne (carnitas on corn cakes) and, when I'm feeling fancy, a margarita with Sammy Hagar's own Cabo Wabo tequila."}
{"text":"Should have known this would be the ultimate tourist trap but it was time for a break. Stopped in after shopping the miracle mile. Great view of Bellagio fountains but too much of the usual obnoxious Vegas Stuff. You know the street beggars and entertainers/impersonators. Waited forever for drinks and food. Would not go back. Wish this place was inside Cosmo. Would be fun!!"}
{"text":"Good Margaritas, decent gazpacho and a nice place to sit outside and catch some sun while people watching.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Katherine's margaritas are incredible!!  Best bartender ever."}
{"text":"This place was great! My boyfriend and I got free margaritas with the yelp check-in deal! They don't offer chips and salsa before your meal which is weird for a Mexican restaurant, but the service and food were good, so I'd definitely be back."}
{"text":"Holly wow this place was awesome! We got a place on the patio. The Decor was fun. The best part was the ahi ceviche was incredible! I don't usually like ceviche but I've been craving it ever sense. I highly recommend squeezing some lime on it! The service was also spot on! Four thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, slow service, nacho add a flavor rip off, hidden unavailable shrimp enchilada !! Taco bell is a much better deal. !!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch our second day in Vegas. The pictures all looked good so we decided to give it a shot. The food was okay. We each had one drink that were also just okay. I felt it was way too overpriced for the quality especially since they were just tacos. But since it's Vegas and on the Strip expect to pay a lot more for everything. The staff was friendly and our waitress was pretty attentive. Just wish the food would have been better."}
{"text":"The food was just \"ok\" and didn't do much for me. I didn't even want to finish my quesadilla because it tasted plain; so I left unsatisfied. Good thing we had a nice server who was on top of keeping our drinks refilled and checking in on us."}
{"text":"When we saw this so close to our hotel we got very excited and couldn't wait to try it.  We were hoping for a memorable meal and some yummy tequila.  The place was mobbed when we arrived for lunch but we were able to sit at a high top inside right away.  We asked the waitress for some recommendations on which tequila to try first and (of course) she suggested the Cabo Wabo.  OK, we both got margeritas. 

I inquired about gluten free and she brought me a gluten free menu which, to my surprise, was rather small considering a lot of mexican food is gluten free.  I ended up ordering the Shrimp Fajitas.  FAJITAS....as in comes with soft corn tortillas?  NOPE.  My meal came and no tortillas.  I asked and the waitress told that they had gluten in them.  Uh, ok.....shouldn't the menu state they DON'T come with them?  I mean, fajitas are fajitas.  

Next order of business was to get some silverware so we could actually eat our meals.  We asked and then waited, and waited and waited.  I finally got up and took silverware off an empty table.  Hubby asked for some hot sauce, which was never delivered either.  Service sucked, flat out.  Our waitress acted as if we were an annoyance to her.  The food was mediocre at best and EXTREMELY overpriced.  I'm sorry Sammy.....I really had high hopes for this place but we will not be back."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by all the bad reviews. I didn't think our lunch was *that* bad. We took advantage of the patio seating right on the strip. Great people watching of course and a great view of the Bellagio fountains.

Our server had a spunky personality and made us feel comfortable. We wanted margaritas so she suggested we get a pitcher to share. We went with the Coconut Margarita and we all really enjoyed it. 

The chips & salsa were REALLY good. Since we waited quite awhile to order and to then to finally get our food we had our share of them.

I had the Cheese Enchilada/Chicken Taquitos combo plate ($10). I thought it was on the bland side. Good but not great. My friends enjoyed their Shrimp Fajitas. 

Overall I thought it was a decent place for cheap eats and a good marg. I probably won't come back since there are so many other great places to eat."}
{"text":"We had a table on the patio, which was great for the view of the Las Vegas Strip. Friendly server. I wish I could remember her name, but she was awesome, very attentive, and super fun. We decided to go with a pitcher of Mai Tai's and were not disappointed. I was a bit taken back by the price at first ($50), but we were each able to get 3 full glasses, so we actually made out much cheaper than if was buying drinks on the strip. We would defiantly come back to eat, the food that was delivered around us looked and smelled divine."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon to go meat browsing aka check out guys on the strip.

We sat on the balcony outside, ordered a pitcher of blackberry mojitos with a side of chips and guac. 

The people watching here is awesome, a great place just to kick back if you are over the pool scene for the day and just want to get your drink on."}
{"text":"Food was very mediocre and relatively overpriced, and there's a plate-splitting charge. The mango margarita I ordered was strong but not very good. They also sat us by the door leading outside, so every time the waiters came in and out we were struck by a blast of freezing air."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review to hopefully stop people from visiting this place.  It's a great location, and a fun atmosphere.  Its my opinion that doesn't matter when a party of 4 pays $130 for an easy to forget  lunch.  I have to correct myself,  it's very memorable, but only because of the cost.

Yes, 3 of the 4 got margaritas, but the entrees were not high quality and over garlicked.  The drinks were okay, not great.  Yes I understand Vegas is not dirt cheap, and I am perfectly willing to pay good money for good food.  If you are going to charge gourmet prices, please at least make above average food!

Great server, with a good attitude,  but the food and price dynamic didn't work for me."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We ate here 3 different times our last stay and 2 times the last!
Great day spot for a good brunch or lunch! Their salads are amazing, they give you a free mimosa on your receipt for the following day too which is nice as the drinks are $12 a pop. Don't be surprised though on the wait, we waited awhile for service but the view was nice and we weren't in a rush anyway so we didn't mind!"}
{"text":"We were at a conference at PH and stumbled upon this place for lunch on 3/5. We had a party of 7 and waited no more than a couple if minutes for a table. 
Ambience: low key rock n' roll theme restaurant. Looks like a place that could get nice and rowdy later. They had a nice patio that appeared somewhat crowded. 
Service: pretty decent. Our server came right away to introduce herself. Drink orders were taken right away. She came often for refills. Most if food came put right away. One dish had a mistake and took a little time to be corrected. 
Food; pretty decent. Chips and salsa were good. I had the chicken sabana. This was recommended by the waitress. I couldn't tell how big the plate was, and she recommended against ordering more. Food was good and tasty. A little in the oily and greasy side, but good. I liked the chimichurri sauce on top. The chicken was flattened nice and thin and was still juicy. 

All in all, a good lunch. Value was decent and well. Good for groups."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and the food was great and cheap! Only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is the server. My husband and I were a little tired and thirsty from the night before. We needed some water and food to get us through the day. We waited about ten minutes before a server came to just get our drink order, which was just water. We were ready to order, but they had to come back to get our order? Finally after another 15 minutes, he returned and got our order. Luckily the food came out super quick, then it was time for the check and we waited about 20 minutes for the check. For the price of breakfast compared to other places in Vegas, this place is awesome. For $10, you get eggs, bacon, toast and breakfast potatoes. And you have a nice view of the strip and hotels if you eat outside. I think they can do a bit better with the service though!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand the good reviews this place has gotten. As bad as I've always thought this place is, we've managed to end up there three times. I know...I know...

The first time wasn't all bad. We had some generic nachos and I got a free drink, because the bartender messed up someone's drink order, and handed it to me instead of tossing it. Freeness aside, it was pretty gross.

Round 2. Definitely the worst of the three. Our margaritas were SO disgusting, we had to make up drinking games just to chug them down. We NEVER complain about drinks...too strong, too weak, too warm...nothing really phases us. We finally added \"too tastes like they used the shaker that still had sour cream in it from two days ago,\" to the list, after much debate. Plus, the shake weight commercial kept playing, so we made the best of it.

Third and final. Nothing stood out as being especially bad. The food was eh. The service was eh. I just finally learned my lesson. The only redeeming quality this place has is that it's a good people-watching location."}
{"text":"This place gets a two because it is insanely overpriced, and the portions are small. The food tastes fine, but not great.. Cabo Wabo  has a nice patio on the Vegas strip, but I could eat better somewhere else for the same price or cheaper. I will say, they do have decent margaritas. 

Oh and avoid the nacho appetizer. It's literally one dozen nachos for WAYYYY too much."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Saturday night and to my surprise got seated right away. We sat on the patio which is dead center in the chaos of the strip but still a very good atmosphere. There was live music that night which was nice. I used the free drink coupon offered on yelp which saved me $10, I got the tortilla soup and my boyfriend got the fajitas which were very good. Overall it was a good experience and not overly priced which was a plus."}
{"text":"The Reuben is almost as good as bartender Daryn. Fun atmosphere, cool people, great food and drinks. Daryn is efficient without making you feel rushed. Love this place when I'm passing through McCarran."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Maybe because I got a burger instead of a Mexican dish because I been here before and their tacos are pretty good. Also what I didn't like was how the tables were so small. Overall the costumer service was good."}
{"text":"Saturday Breakfast:

Cons:
Orange Juice - horrible, tastes like Tang
Service - so slow
Pancakes - came cold, not with 'fresh' fruit instead about 10 newly       thawed blueberries on top, did not come with syrup and took about 10 min to get some

Pros:
None

Conclusion:
Don't go here."}
{"text":"There are only two stars to give to this place, one for the location and patio view, and the other for the decor of the restaraunt.  The salsa was great too, but I'm out of stars.

I and another guest at the table ordered a steak and chicken taco combination, there were three of us total. Our food came out in minutes!!  WOW!  I read another reviewer here with the same experience, littlerally a minute or two after they ordered it, and for that gave it 4 stars.  Let me clue you in!  This Vegas magic performance is not a good thing. Chicken and Steak take time to cook!!!  I can tell you, from the taste, that this was not cooked to order.....  NOR was it cooked anytime in the past hour prior to eating it.  I'm suprised I didn't donate my food to thier bathroom afterwards, it was so gross I didn't finish it.  The waitress never came back to ask us how our food was, nor did anyone for that matter.  **Ramsey alert, I think this place is a canidate for Kitchen Nightmares!!

If you want a cool patio view and a drink of some sort, this is your spot, otherwise, RUN, not WALK, somewhere else.  Overpriced microwave food can be had elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I LOVED this place! the atmosphere was great. Over looking the strip and people watching. Before we were served I asked the waitress about the free Marg when you Check In and she said she would honor it even though the coupon to pop up on my phone. She suggested fish tacos and they were amazing! My boyfriend got a wet carne asada/chicken burrito that was good as well. I think out of the two days that I was in Vegas I got my biggest buzz there lol off of two margaritas! I will def be back my next visit!"}
{"text":"We sat inside because we didn't want to bake in the July Las Vegas sun, but the patio would be good for people watching.  Inside the music was too loud and while our server was nice, it took a while to get our drinks and food.  I had the carnitas tacos for a late lunch which were pretty tasty, but the meal was small.  The place is pricey especially for drinks.   Luckily I had the Yelp check-in offer for a free house margarita that the wife enjoyed."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Super fun atmosphere too. Definitely a place to stop by if you're on the strip."}
{"text":"hands down the very worst dinner I've ever had..
My family waited despite a reservation and the 6 of us were shown to two very small round tables pushed together despite a half empty restaurant. I said it wasn't good for us and back we went to waiting for someone to push a chair over to a regular table. Food was bland, fish tacos were dry, no cheese or any seasoning, the nachos had liquid cheese ala Velveeta. No live music, just two girls handing out free Heinekens. It was 7 pm and dead inside except for football games without sound and security outside the ladies room with a stone drunk woman inside. Skip this one, you'll thank me.
Cabo Yucko...I gave them one star because you have nothing lower on Yelp"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa is so yummy... I had chicken taquito appetizer they were really good."}
{"text":"Not a lot of value in terms of bang for your buck but what you end up getting tastes pretty good and the house margarita was exceptional as they use Cabo tequila. A check in on yelp (no prob) gets you a free margarita on the rocks and then the AAA coupon book from the mall that gets shoved down your throat nets another 20% off your bill. So, it became reasonable but after tip, we still spent $40 for tacos and chips and salsa. But we got free margs that are normally $10/ea and we enjoyed the service from the staff."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Best Mexican I had in Vegas. This is definitely the spot to go to if you're craving Mexican. Should warn you the music is really loud so you would enjoy it with a group of friends with a lot of drinks! We had these really nice pictures taken by a random lady inside saying they were \"free\" but then saw the really nice frame and how it was put together and paid 20 bucks. Totally worth it"}
{"text":"Cabo Wabo is a lot of fun. My husband and I came here on Sunday to watch the afternoon football games. The hostess was nice enough to put us at a table in front of the TV with the game we wanted to watch. We ordered a pitcher of pi√±a colada, but instead got a pitcher of the Cocorita, but didn't complain because it tasted good. We shared the tuna ceviche, guacamole, and quest fundido which were all great. We also shared a carne asada burrito, which wasn't bad, but the enchilada sauce was too smokey and the carne asada pieces were a little too grilled bordering on crunchy. We'd definitely go back for another lunch next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came for lunch.  The chips and salsa were above average, my entree was pick 3, and none of it was spectacular, also louder(music, not ambient noise) then I would have expected for a lunch crowd."}
{"text":"For a chain, I thought this was actually pretty good.  Decent amount of food for what you pay for.  We had a couple of the special Caborita's - really tasty on a hot day - and we didn't get suckered into paying for some cheap ass souvenir glass with this one (unlike another spot on the strip recently reviewed by me).  We tried the Nacho's with the Carne Asada - HUGE order of Nachos, but we were starving and eat every bite - hold the jalape√±os for me, but everything else on that plate was really great.  For lunch, I had the Carne Asada taco plate - with rice and beans - after the gigantic nachos, I could only eat the tacos and did a tasting of the rice and beans - everything was really good and some points for a nice presentation.  No waiting, service was quick and our waiter was always one step ahead of us with water refills and checking on us during a busy Memorial Day weekend visit.  I'd go here again and try more things on the menu.  Cool Millenials with those fake cigarettes that only blow vapor where everywhere - so you know it must be hip! LOL"}
{"text":"Didn't expect much and was last minute but was not very clean, service was good but fish tacos looked as if they were frozen then heated up- no flavor."}
{"text":"If you like good food, good atmosphere, and good service then you'll like this place. They have a great selection of food to choose from from the breakfast menu to the dessert menu, Cabo Wabo has got you covered. The staff is super friendly, and will leave you with a smile and wanting you to come back on your next visit to the strip."}
{"text":"They have some great margaritas!  The cocorita was delicious. We also ordered the fajitas for 2, excellent flavor and generous portions. Plenty of seating for small or large groups.  We went on a Friday night, party of 6. Only complaint is I wish they had faster service, hence the 4 star.  Would definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had just arrived in Vegas on a Friday a few hours earlier.  First day was for exploring the strip.  We started at our hotel (MGM) and when we got to Planet Hollywood, she just wanted to find some place to relax with a drink and people watch.  We saw cabo wabo, though margaritas would be good, and stopped.

This is a good place for what it is - chain restaurant type of Mexican food.  But the location is superb.  We sat on the patio at the railing and had a great view of Bellagio, Caesar's up the block, and the people walking along the strip.  So it's a great place for just that - relaxing on the strip in the sun to people watch.

They also have skinny margaritas, and good ones too.  We're both a bit health conscious (though you couldn't tell by the giant nachos we ordered), and try to avoid drowning drinks in sour mix.  It wasn't too pricey for Vegas - $10/margarita, $15 for the nachos - so we got yards of skinny ritas and nachos and had a really nice afternoon.  

I wouldn't come here for a nice dinner or anything, but if you want a patio on the strip, this is a good place to come."}
{"text":"It was better than I expected. Being a chain type place I wasn't expecting much but the drinks were good, food solid and staff very good.  Also, we sat outside and enjoyed a beautiful sunny day.  The staff was quick to seat us. The waitress was busy but stopped to tell us she would be right back. She got our drinks quickly. Our food was delivered by someone else in a reasonable time and hot.  The food tested good. The guac was great!  Had a waborita which was overpriced at $12 but tasted good. Was very pleasant sitting outside, watching the strip, and seeing all the crazy people. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner with my hubby. This location is inside the Miracle Mile Shop at The Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. The atmosphere was fun but a bit loud. The chairs however are uncomfortable. This is a good spot to come with a group to have drinks. Now to the food. We ordered the teriyaki wings to start which were very good. They were crispy and the sauce was tasty. For the entree I had the Fish Tacos which tasted good but the fish was tough and over cooked! My hubby had the beef enchiladas which he said he enjoyed. Both dishes came with rice and beans which we both didn't really care for. Our server was very attentive and catered to our needs. I had a Groupon that I purchased which made our bill only $20 bucks! Can't beat that! Will we return here probably not but overall the meal was okay!"}
{"text":"Service here was great, we ordered a couple margaritas which were great and the Chipotle chicken fajitas which were pretty tasty (I was worried they wouldn't be good) but, luckily they were! We came here for lunch and blew $75+ with the two drinks and two entrees. Prices are pretty steep but, definitely a great spot to people watch out on the patio and enjoy some (very loud) music and strong drinks."}
{"text":"The food is amazing as always and our waitress is on top! Nothing but an A+ for cabo wabo and for our waitress Ceara! Smiles all the way!"}
{"text":"It took a really long time to get our food - not to mention we had to keep asking for some of what we ordered.

Watching people dance on the bar was fun though."}
{"text":"Food & service were equally great!

Server suggested the ceviche and it was to die for!

Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"One of the better Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas, Cabo Wabo's service for us has always been top notch. The food is some of the best Mexican food in Las Vegas that we've found. 

Our server, Mario was very swift and helpful with the menu. He gave us the perfect amount of time we needed to look at the menu without us having to call him over and without hounding us. The food also came out in a timely manner. We ordered fajitas for one which was enough for us to share between the both of us and get full after our queso and salsa chips. I'm not a fan of the chips and salsa not being served freely but being that it's on the strip, it's understandable seeing as though so many people could just be drunk and want to come eat free chips. Lol the charge of three to four dollars isn't bad but if you're going to invest towards the chips and salsa, get the queso and chips for nine dollars instead because the queso is amazing and very filling. Both queso and salsa are bottomless. Our fajitas were steak and shrimp. The steak could have been a little more tender, it was a little chewier than we prefer but the shrimp was absolutely delicious and had a sweeter flavor. Mmmm...portions of sides were all well measured.

After our meal we were both full and satisfied. Mario brought us our ticket but informed us that happy hour just started at 3pm! He encouraged us to try the sangrias since we're not big tequila drinkers and we ended up getting two, one white and one red for $6.80 per drink when originally they are double that! Mario brought them in to go cups which was pretty handy and clever! The white one is my favorite but my fianc√©e likes the red so it worked out perfectly! 

If you're going to eat here, eat outside. If you eat by the you edge you'll get a good view of the Bellagio fountain show! 

We'll definitely be back! Thanks Mario!"}
{"text":"The food are great. Cilantro jalape√±o chicken, chicken taco, nacho and mango margarita are so delicious. Danny M is our server and he is awesome.
Everyone should ask for Danny M."}
{"text":"Ok, didn't eat here, didn't sit at the bar here, but we did visit here to get a drink in a guitar after seeing someone on the strip carrying one. We decided to venture out to find Cabo Wabo and finally found it at Miracle Miles in PH. The decor is very tropical, but we weren't here to admire the scenery. Went to the side of the restaurant that's actually in the Miracle Miles shop and there were two girls taking drinks order. We requested the drinks in the guitar, but couldn't decide on the flavor. She gave us samples of the ones we wanted to try. Finally we decided on the drink that tastes like mango..I forgot what it's called. She puts it in a guitar and turns the guitar on which was pretty cool. The drink was $50. Now I'm not much of a drinker so I don't know if 100 oz of alcohol is worth that price...is it? Very cool experience all in all."}
{"text":"Oh my....stopped here to sit outside for lunch.  We ordered bloody marys.  They were DISGUSTING....probably the worst bloody mary I have ever had.  It tasted like dish water.  Gross....not a good way to start off a day.  Then I ordered the taco salad.  It tasted like something from Taco Bell....dont get me wrong...I love me some Taco Bell but not at a place not called Taco Bell...yuck.  They did have some good chips and salsa.  Also, the outdoor area was cool despite the sweltering heat.....so MEHHHHH"}
{"text":"My husbnd and I visited on 4/4/2012 with a Groupon that was set to expire on 4/4/2012.  We advised the waitress that we had a Groupon when we were seated.  Thank god we had that Groupon...talk about terrible service!   It took 20 minutes to place our drink order and we got our food long before our drinks!  When my husbd to go to the bar to get it!  The food was TERRIBLE!!!!  Wehad a $60 Groupon, so we ordered food and drinks to get to $60.  When it was time for the bill, the waitress advised that the Groupon would not be honored because it \"expired\" that day.  We asked to speak with the manager who stuck wit hthe story that the Groupon expired at 12:01 minight and that we would only get $30 knocked off of our $75 bill.  He aslo tried to tell us the Groupon was for parties of 4 or more, which was not true as the Groupon nevestated this anywhere.  We argued with the manager, who eventaully agreed to take a bit mor off of our bill due to the horrendous service.  I will NEVER eat at this establishment again, the food was terrbile and the service was even worse!  Do not waste your time or money here...eveif yo do have a Groupon!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was so, ridiculously, unbelievably, horribly....slow!!! omg so slow. So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so SO slow. It was like there was only one server working, and we pretty much only saw one, so, well, you know.....It took us two and a half hours to order, eat, and get a bill for a meal that should have not gone one minute past one hour, max.

I ordered chips and salsa, and the waiter upsold me to get the salsa/queso/something else trio things. It was good. Ordered some kind of dinner that had chicken and a jalepeno-cilantro type sauce. It was good.  Not very spicy, but I liked it that way.

And yes, it was very, very expensive."}
{"text":"Deian was our server...  Great sense of humor,  conversation and great customer service skill! Sampler app has a bit of everything...  Ordered a strawberry margarita-good amount of flavor."}
{"text":"Super nice and sweet waitress BUT worst Mexican food I've had. Like no kidding is really really bad. We were super hungry and it was late, usually when we are that hungry everything test good but not Cabo wabo's food... yes it was that bad.  The 2 stars is only because the waitress was super good otherwise I'd give zero."}
{"text":"Ate inside - hostess said the wait is 15 min, we got the table in 15 min. Wanted Chicken Sabana, waiter recommended Chicken Jalape√±o; switched to that and really liked it. We  felt the food came a bit late, but didn't time it and could have been subjective as we were tired and hungry. Waiter was nice and friendly. Overall, great food and smooth experience, which given how busy the Strip was at the time, it was quite something."}
{"text":"Was looking fw to coming here as my BF is a Sammy Hagar fan. We were seated in a booth after I requested it. Our server Adam was not very professional. We showed him the yelp check in free margarita and
asked for light ice. He brought the margarita it wasn't light ice and I said I asked for light ice... he shrugged his shoulders. Really??? My BF while dipping chips into the salsa discovered a long hair literally buried in the salsa that was served with the greasy tortilla chips. Omg how disgusting. At this point we were Leary and my BF wanted to leave so I asked for the manager. She came over and said we threw out that batch of salsa and we told her about the margarita with the ice issue. She got me a new margarita with light ice. Also we told her that we're off to a bad start and were Leary about ordering anymore food. She assured us she would make sure that our order was checked by herself personally before coming out and she would come back to check in. Well that never happened. My BF asked her which steak platter to get and she recommended the NY strip. So trusting her recommendations that we decided to order. I ordered a salad with carne assda aka there version is (sirloin steak) and my BF ordered the NY strip. Omg my salad had no carne asada. It was chopped up pieces of bacon and my BF NY strip steak was all grizzle. We both sent back our entrees. They remade my salad with slices of carne assda which was very chewy and he got the carne asada (sirloin steak). My salad was meh it was thrown together very quickly and his carne assda again was extremely chewy uneatable and tasteless. Reluctantly we ate the meal. Adam brought the bill and they tried to make it look like a discount. But it wasn't much especially for all the issues we had. So we again asked for the manager and my BF noticed our waiter was whispering to another server and both looking at us. Wow....how tacky and unprofessional. The same manager came back along with a guy which was never introduced to us and she said I was dealing with a party but she did walk past are area several times but never stopped by us during are entrees as promised to us so my BF told her that his gut feeling was he wanted to leave after the hair in the salsa and that he sent back the NY strip and he showed her the uneatable carne asada (sirlion steak) as proof and said this wasn't the experience he was looking for and was extremely disappointed.  She paused and her body language wanted to do nothing. The guy with her said remove the carne asada. Wow really??? Thanks....so my BF went to wash up and the manager came back with the adjusted bill and I told her this was overall a horrible experience and my salad was meh. She said finally I'm taking care of the bill. Please come back.

LOL had you not avoided us and been more attentive when are entrees came out and also didn't come back after we both sent back are entrees. We arm wrestled with them to get the entire meal compted in itself is just bad customer service period. My BF gut feeling was correct. He wanted to go to the Border Grill after the salsa incident but I wanted to give them a chance. HUGE MISTAKE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, mediocre food! That's a one line experience at the Cabo Wabo cantina in Planet Hollywood casino. We went here for lunch one Saturday, after finding an hour long wait at our first choice restaurant. Their patio was packed, but they had seating available inside.

It is located right on the strip between planet hollywood and paris. The location is great since you don't really need to walk inside a casino or actually look for this place. It overlooks the Cosmopolitan and Bellagio.

The place is well setup in mexican decor. I think it's also a sports bar, so they have plenty of TVs lined along the wall. An bar runs along an entire wall, which is pretty big. They also have an outdoor patio, which is great for people watching, and if you're lucky, you can see the Bellagio fountains as well. Even though we were inside, our table was just by the open patio, so we had plenty of direct light. The service is pretty decent, but not prompt or too friendly.

We started off with a pitcher of bahama mama, which was excellent. I'd recommend getting this here. We later had a pitcher of the maui rocker, which was too sweet and syrupy. I didn't enjoy that one.

The food was just meh. We got a queso to share, which we great, but it went downhill from there. We got a burrito, a steak fajita, a chicken sabana, and a cilantro japaleno chicken, none of which are worth a mention. They were fine, but just fine.

The prices are definitely on the higher side, but the location, decor and ambiance justifies it. Our check was $250 for two pitchers, one appetizer, and four entrees.

I would not really go back here for a meal. However, this would be a great place to get a drink on the patio on a warm evening, and try some appetizers."}
{"text":"A great place to eat outside when the weather's nice, and watch the crowd going by on the Strip. The food is very good. We had chips with salsa and guacamole, grilled chicken tacos, carnitas, and a burrito. We all enjoyed our food. The service was good. The only problem for us was that there was a singer performing there, and he was rather loud, so it was hard to chat. If you're interested in music and partying more than chatting, not a problem. The prices were reasonable for what you get, considering the location."}
{"text":"gets two stars purely for the people watching aspect.  as far as the food, it sucked.  couldnt eat it.  sent my wabo margarita back, gag me gross."}
{"text":"It has been 3 years that I have been coming here. Some faces are new and some are still here but one thing remains the same... great drinks and awesome service. 
I have now discovered they make skinny margaritas which is cool for those of us watching our figures ( and not just watch them expand). I also love the chopped salad with chicken. It is so filling and not heavy. 
Only thing I miss is when the bartenders could have a shot with you and they made it more of a party on the patio kind of atmosphere. But they are still great to hang out with. 
Shout out to Kristy, George, Dara, Louisa, Dee, Joe and everyone else who works there. You are what makes Cabo Wabo so awesome 

Last night for the  first time we sat at an outside table instead of the bar because we
Had our minor daughter with us. Laura was our waitress and she is AMAZING! We also had Jennifer, one of the managers check on us and she truly takes her job seriously. We made a \"suggestion\" and she made sure we were taken care of. Dara, one of our FAVORITE bartenders, also
Made sure to make our drinks exactly how we like them. 

Again... as a local going to the strip... this is THE place to frequent!"}
{"text":"Went to Cabo Wabo December 18, 2014.  I can't remember the food items I ordered.  I can only remember the free margarita for checking in on Yelp. Drink needed a bit more alcohol, but hey, it was free!  The atmosphere was decent at that time...not too loud The waitress was nice and very friendly."}
{"text":"We've been taken such good care of by our amazing server Israel and our awesome bartender Darrien that this has become our daily pit stop before our festivities. Such a nice crew of staff and giving us all kinds of recommendations of things to do while we're here!"}
{"text":"The only reason we went here was for the free margarita for checking into yelp- but I'm so glad we came!  This is such a fun place!  We sat outside along the counter and people watched- so Vegas!  Our sever, Laura, was incredible!!!  So patient, sweet and efficient!  I HIGHLY recommend the Southwest Cobb Salad!!!  It was incredible!  Worth every penny!!  This is definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"All I got was a frozen margarita at 1 in the morning, so my review doesn't apply to the food. But the drinks arrived fast and you could taste the tequila without feeling like you just did a shot of it. And the cups are actually nice enough to keep."}
{"text":"If you want to experience the Vegas strip this is your place. Sit outside facing the street and be entertained for hours. Check in and get the free margarita but don't expect anything fancy. Chips were too thick for my taste and the burrito bowl was fair but it was enjoyable to sit outside. Loud music and a good location. Jessica, my waitress was very attentive and helpful and I would probably come back for the atmosphere but not the mediocre Mexican food."}
{"text":"WHAT A HORRIBLE PLACE! PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE. With so many great places in Vegas.. Don't waste your time at this place

1. The food was a cheap/horrible attempt at mexican- very dried out and tasteless
2. The waitress never came around with our drinks, even after asking 3times
3. Pricing was way too high for the quality of food and service"}
{"text":"Meh. Loud. Overpriced. $13 for a glass of house wine? Nuts. The improv troupe was phenomenal. Too bad we could barely hear them with the downstairs sound so loud. Would come back to see them, but won't be ordering anything. 

What's sad is that it's a prime location with lots of potential. If they weren't so greedy with their prices, they would actually make more, because this place would be packed with locals. Parking is good, walking through the mall isn't too bad, and the service is pretty good."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great food right on the strip. We stopped by for something fresh from all of the savory food that's all too common at most restaurants around the area. We sat outside, which was nice with some of the sun but under some covering. 
We started with shrimp ceviche and a margarita; really nice and fresh, perfect for a hot day. She got barbacoa beef tacos, and I got fish and chips. The tacos came with standard beans and rice, and a few slices of lime on side, but they were really good. I think she got 3 tacos, and I had 4 pieces of fish. The fish were nice and crunchy and hot and juicy on the inside; the fries were comparable with most other places, and they were at least hot and crunchy, not stale nor too starchy. 
It was some of the best food we had during the week, good price, no wait, and sits right on the strip, so great location. We'd definitely come back and try some more margaritas and other food :)"}
{"text":"Great location on the strip but the food & service needs improvement. 
Wait a very long time to someone to take our order. The queso was a disappointment:("}
{"text":"Just had a great lunch!! Art was our server and he made us feel like he was really glad to be helping us!! The chips and salsa were some.of the best ever and the lunch plates we had - carnitas platter and carnitas tacos were delicious!! We really enjoyed our time and would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"The 2 stars is based on the service specifically, nothing to do with the quality of the food. The food itself was delicious. I went last night with a girl friend and our server was Homero. He was nice but really pushy. I'm currently over 9 months pregnant and it's pretty visible... My friend and I ordered waters and she got a soda, but the server went on and on about the margaritas for what seemed like a few minutes when we had already established that neither of us was going to be drinking. It was pretty busy but it took quite a while for us to get our water. 

My friend ordered the tortilla soup and when they brought it out there was no spoon, so she politely asked for one. The food runner who brought out the soup and our server kept asking, \"Are you sure it's not on the side of your bowl?\" and frantically looking all over our table as if they've recently had a mass amount of spoon thieves? Weird. 

The price of the food was as expected for being on the Las Vegas Strip. But $9 for some guacamole? Beat it! I should have brought my own avocados.

When the check came, Homero had no shame in handing it to us while very bluntly POINTING to the tip section and said, \"Here you go, ladies. And so you know, any tip is appreciated.\" At that point, it was tempting to not even leave a tip. That was pretty rude."}
{"text":"Food was good, my little daughter enjoy the place... great vibe... and nacho hit the spot"}
{"text":"Awesome.  Love this place.  We come every time we are in Las Vegas!  Guacamole is great, fajitas are great.  Sit outside to really experience all that Las Vegas has to offer.  People watching is a plus!!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended. We grabbed lunch here and boy were we in for a shock when the bill came. Our server was really attentive and so graciously charged us for extra funny-tasting salsa and salad dressing. I didn't feel like the food and beverages were worth the money that we paid. I have had better chain Mexican food but cool for drinks and apps.... I guess."}
{"text":"Food was not authentic tasting and for 16.00 for a carne asada burrito definitely  not worth it . Chicken tortilla soup tasted just like their salsa with cheese and chicken added to it horrible has to send it back. Service was supper slow waited 25min to pay our check . Would not recommend this place . The only reason I gave it 2 stars and not zero was the atmosphere was pretty cool live one man band was pretty good ."}
{"text":"I went here briefly before they were closed so I expected somewhat crappy service.  But since I was craving for some chicken wings, I braced myself for the abuse.

 I was shocked when the food came out literally seconds after we ordered it.  I have never in my life received food so fast.  Not even from a fast food restaurant.  I was thinking that it was just me since I had wings, but even a table of four that came in after me, was served in less than a minute.  

It was the best magic trick I had seen in Vegas! Go there just for the show, if anything else.  

I am not big on Mexican food, hence the reason I ordered chicken wings at a Mexican restaurant.  Don't judge me...the wings were excellent, by the way!!"}
{"text":"Manager is very disrespectful to staff and customers. Had to leave and go elsewhere. I've been asked to elaborate so will at the manager berated the staff while I was attempting to get service. I complained and the manager called security to remove me. Really didn't think that needed to happen."}
{"text":"We visited 4 people group at night time, and ordered different plate and beer. I ordered tacos plate which was nice volume for Japanese so that was abe to be finished.
Everybody enjoyed the good taste meal, but little bit expensive. I'm not sure this is regular or not at the center of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Being a HUGE Sammy fan, as well as a lover of cantinas and mexican food, I couldn't wait to hit Cabo Wabo in Vegas.  Walked there from MGM in over 100degree heat and sorry to say...VERY disappointed.  Sat at the bar and the bartender wasn't your jovial bartender you'd hope to find behind the bar.  Ordered a marg and an app and the app took sooooo long and with no acknowledgment from the bartender, we asked for the bill and left.  Had planned on cocktails and lunch and instead had one drink, shared a dip and left.  Probably won't go back.  Sad."}
{"text":"I came here because of Sammy Hagar.

He was in town for Rock 'N Roll Fantasy Camp, so I figured he would come by his bar at least once during his time here.  Well, as far as I know, he didn't.
That said, the food here is very good.  I can vouch for their breakfast menu well, I had both the CW Eggs Benedict and the CW Huevos Rancheros.  Both were excellent, and the CW Home fries were great.  The breakfast adult beverages, the CW Bloody Mary was excellent, up there with some of the best I have ever had.  The Bellini, Blood Orange Mimosa, and regular Mimosa are also good and contain a healthy amount of alcohol.
I also sampled the lunch menu on one of the visits, and had the fish taco's, which were also excellent.  The beans and rice that came with it are also very tasty.
The only complaint is everything is a little pricey, but then again so are most things on the strip.  The food was great, the atmosphere was fun (even without Sammy showing up) and I can check Cabo Wabo off the bucket list after four visits."}
{"text":"Place was happening on Friday night. Got an couple of Patron shots, each shots were $12. It wasn't your normal shot glass, so I was pleased about that.

Ordered some frozen Margaritas they were about $17. I know you could get them maybe little cheaper someone else, but was nearby and ready to party.

I would go to this spot again if I ever returned to Vegas. 

Bartender was super cool."}
{"text":"We were initially told about 30 min of wait time but luckily we were called within 10 min!!We got a table outside on the patio. Great ambience with music playing in the background and the Amazing view of bellagio and Eiffel Tower.

We ordered nachos platter and chicken enchiladas. The food was good but not great. 
The server was so kind and we Got free margarita as part of Yelp checkin. It's Vegas what can you expect!! 

The patio table was too small and it could barely fit for 4ppl and their food!!"}
{"text":"Free margarita with check-in! Crispy shrimp tacos delicious for a touristy place. Our server Christine was awesome super friendly and fast."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said?  Well the Cabo Wabo Tequila shots are GENEROUS. Maybe someone else has said it, and I may have missed it, but if that is the case it is worth repeating!  GENEROUS.  It is like a triple shot! Which is good cuz it's like $9 a shot. Love this place!  Must sit on the patio!!! Excellent location for people watching, sipping a few drinks and chatting it up.  Food is mmeehhh... but I have endured worse.  Chips are good, salsa is okay.  I am a people watcher and in Las Vegas there are freaks a plenty!!  Plus Cabo has a fun carefree party environment with live music.  NO... it isn't the best live music, but it is entertaining while you people watch, chat it up with your mates and drink generous tequila shots.  It is what it is and what it is is good."}
{"text":"Located in the Miracle Shops and you can hear them play Top 40s and David Guettas' entire album while walking by. They have an outdoors area to sit and eat as well as space inside but we sat at the bar trying signature drink, the Waborita and boy oh boy was it tasty. Of course a camera girl walked p to us asking to take our picture for a discount and blah blah blah. We declined on buying the picture and she walked away frustrated, well why even bother?"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after a show. We were able to split fajitas for two $38.95 amongst the four of us. Needless to say there was plenty of food! It wasn't the best food, however, it was edible. I was bummed with the chips and salsa $3.95 because the chips were cold and the salsa had no taste. Trust me I have had better in the LV valley. The only thing that made up for the food was the good service. Our server Laura was awesome and thoughtful!"}
{"text":"Pretty bland food, from the salsa to the tacos. The tortilla soup is good, but heavy.  Great service from Calvin though, the others are drones with zero personality. MaitreDs were too engrossed in their own banter to even acknowledge us."}
{"text":"Eat here if you are strolling around the strip and looking for a quick bite to eat. I HIGHLY recommend the Chicken Tortilla soup. I love chicken tortilla soup, and their version easily makes my top 5. The Short Rib burrito is DELICIOUS! Even the chips and salsa were flavorful. I loved the salsa so much, I wanted to take it to-go, but didn't want to look like THAT person. LOL Overall, I had a really great experience here. Oh, and you get a FREE Margarita when you check in??! SOLD!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and service despite how busy it was. My BF and I were out for a date night and decided to check this place out. We ordered the fajita and 1 pitcher of margarita. Fantastic view too really enjoyed!"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends and had the best tortilla soup of my life!! Our server Whitney was absolutely amazing, she knew the menu very well, and was super sweet and patient about all my questions! She recommended to me the shrimp tacos and they were amazing! I will def be back to visit this place and see if Whitney is still working."}
{"text":"I had a couple friends in town and we were drawn in by Buy one get one free margarita coupons. The coupon are only good for 12 oz frozen ones out of the machine but I was also told those were on happy hour too without asking for price. We also got the chicken nacho platter.
The nacho's were actually very good and enough toppings for every chip. 
The drinks however turned out to be $12 a piece on special. So for 3 12 oz (fat Tuesday style) really bad margaritas at a \"tequila cantina\" for Cabo Wabo it was $24. You would think they would take better pride in the drinks here since it carries the brand name of a Tequila company but no...

So, for all you tourists or locals... do not accept drink coupons from the strip because it will most likely be some type of scam.  The house always wins! I have learned this the hard way now from Rhumbar, Dick's Last Resort and now Cabo Wabo."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Service was good. Not this best Mexican food that I've had, but for a bar it was great. We had a seat facing the strip outside. It was nice. A great way to start my Vegas trip. Drinks were strong and good. It was a chill and fun place. I recommend starting your Vegas trip here for drinks."}
{"text":"I have a mixed review of Cabo Wabo. We waited about 20 mins to get seated outside, for a party of 10. It's a great atmosphere, music, beautiful views of Bellagio water show. 

I ordered the Baja shrimp Ceviche and it was quite salty and lacking flavor. A friend ordered the Ahi ceviche and she said it tasted strange and was sweet. My husband ordered the carne asada tacos and he loved it. Some friends ordered steak Fajitas for 2 and they raved about how delicious the steak is. However they all got charged extra for rice and beans which they received but didn't order. But was later removed after we brought it up to the manager. When paying our $300 bill, I asked about an odd additional \"tax\" they charged which was close to $13. They said Planet Hollywood charges them for being their so they pass that charge along to the customer (which is ridiculous). 

Really, a Mexican restaurant that doesn't have complimentary chips and salsa?!?

We dined inside last week and it wasn't anything special. Today we sat Outside is way better if u can handle the heat or in our case the wind!"}
{"text":"My mom has been dying to check out Cabo Wabo for while because she loves Sammy Haggar! It was much better than we expected being a chain and after reading all of the negative reviews. It really exceeded our expectations. 

We started with the house margarita and they were delicious and strong. Probably better than any margarita I've had. I went with the shrimp tacos and they were really good, they also came with rice and beans. The whole meal was really filling. The pork tacos are also worth a mention if swine is your thing. If you're gonna try one thing, try the chimichangas. They were on the 'specials' menu that day and had beef and queso cheese, I'm craving these right now! 

The service left a little to be desired and I wish that chips and salsa were complimentary (they are $3). 

All in all I would definitely check this place out if you love tequila, Mexican, or Sammy Haggar. You also have a great view of the Bellagio fountains if you sit on the patio."}
{"text":"had breakfast there. thought it was better than sitting in dusk inside. terrible eggs, artificial orange juice. expensive"}
{"text":"Food was good TexMex fare.  Margarita was one of the worst I'd ever had.  I was totally dumbfounded that their Margaritas could be so bad. Order a beer and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had at a bar.  I would go into detail, but if I did the bartender that served me would likely be jobless and that is never my intention when I leave a bad review.  I will never return to this establishment, and will advise that others avoid it as well."}
{"text":"Food is simply amazing. Ive eaten here several times and it is my favorite place anywhere in the country hands down. Last visit was yesterday and I had the short rib enchiladas and my wife had the beef fajitas. Mine was out of this world. The wife's looked every bit as good as it tasted. The beef was tender and very flavorful. It's more like a tex mex I'd say. How people rate it so poorly I don't know. Service was awesome. Make sure to try the salsa. It's out of the world good. Sammy hagar nailed it here!"}
{"text":"Good spot to eat on the strip. Nice views of the strip and good food and good drinks. Took us awhile for someone to get our drink order but after that service was pretty solid. Had the shrimp tacos and they were knock out"}
{"text":"* Welcome Experience
- Ordinary

Nothing to report here...

* Establishment
- Encouraging

Interesting decor, especially if you are in to Sammy Hagar and all the trappings.  Big, loud, Vegas.  

* Service
- Outstanding 

Alexis was really good!  She was personable and attentive and showed up at all the right times.  Someone who came to clear the table accidentally knocked a glass of ice water in one of my party's plate.  He promptly apologized and sent a manager.  Without question the manager removed the entree from the bill and offered an alternative.  (To go even!)  The leadership definitely emphasizes service.  Bravo!

* Food Quantity / Quality / Presentation
- Discouraging

Keep your expectations LOW - it's CABO WABO.  I mean, any place that has MEXIYAKI on the menu had to be appetizer and beer fare.  It was.  

The $32 New York strip I ordered was smothered in dark sauce to hide the poor quality, and was way past med rare, and tough as can be.  

It was good party food, not a dining experience - (keep your expectations low!)

* What I'll remember

Alexis genuinely cared!

What I can't wait to forget

The gristle I had to cut out from my $32 New York strip."}
{"text":"Our group came in on St. Patrick's day. Some of us went to hang out at the outside bar while we waited for a table. The bartenders out in the patio section were really great and fun to interact with. One of the bartenders who we kept interacting with was Cindy (let's hope I got the name right). She was really great and friendly towards our group.

Now, upon waiting on the list for a table, we were met with an inconvenience. Long story short, we asked to speak to the on-duty manager. The managers name is Yesenia and she came in clutch. We were accommodated and she certainly bettered our experience with this establishment. Yesenia, you are The Real MVP!

Our server this trip was Sarah. She was really great and made great suggestions. Our group looks forward on having Sarah as our server again in the very near future. Thanks for your help Sarah. You are also The Real MVP! She also has some really kick A$$ tattoos :P

Aside from service being very excellent, the food itself was on point. We will make sure to make our return.

See you all in the very near future!"}
{"text":"This place looks like your average casual dining/bar (which it is).The waitresses are dressed casual but all of them are wearing belly shirts! Hey, I'm not mad at them, just wondering if this is some kind of dress code? They were friendly and there was definitely a very laid back vibe. I think I was in my bikini with some small cover up and I didnt feel out of place. There were moments when I felt the service could have been a little quicker but I am a very fast paced (like to be in and out of casual dining in 30 minutes or less) so I can forgive them a little for that.

What warrants the 4* rating? 

The FOOD!!

I would describe it as \"upscale\" or maybe more \"fine dining\" ish... nothing was heavy handed or greasy or overly cheesy as with most mexican restaurants...it was presented nicely and tasted delish and my husband and I did not feel overly full (I hate that).  We ordered the ceviche and a combo that had a cheese enchilada and I think a beef taco, with rice and beans. 

I really did not expect that caliber of mexican food when I walked into this place so I give them their props. 

Also, the location is really great- right off the strip and next to alot of shopping (Sephora is right next door) 

Anyway, seems like alot of mixed reviews of this place but my husband and I truly enjoyed their food; maybe it depends on what you order."}
{"text":"I always come here because i love there taquila but after this time im done. There burrito we got just fell apart bland and oily. Salad was mostly lettuce a couple of sliced tomatoe pieces and and couple of chopped avacado pieces. For 2 fries, 1 salad, 1 burrito, 1 chicken tenders and 2 margaritas spent 92 bucks. My grandmother ate nothing, wife ate nothing kids just had fries. Terrible experience. Margarita was very sweat and made me feel sick. Glass was dirty as well. Not sure how they can do so wrong and they werent at all busy."}
{"text":"After strolling through the streets of Vegas, a common sight were people drinking \"adult slushies.\" At first i thought that these were virgin, until i continued to see empty beer and wine bottles everywhere.  I had to finally ask someone, \"can you drink on the streets here\" and they were like \"yes.\"  I was amazed,  and then it all made sense.  Seeing all of this, i started to crave a margarita badly.  After passing Cabo Wabo a few times, i thought that this would be an appropriate place to quench my thirst.  There was a slight wait to get into the cantina, but the outdoor elevated patio was worth the wait.  Upon being seated our server told us that they were out of menus, so we just asked for a margarita and a mojito.  We started with some chips and salsa.  The salsa had a really smokey background, but not that much flavour.  Shortly after our drinks came, after taking one sip, we both realized that these were very water downed drinks.  We were both very unsatisfied with the drinks, mine literally tasted like just a lime slushie, no alcohol.  We basically just wrote off the night as a poor restaurant pick, but then our bill came.  My drink was $10 and my sisters was $14, i have never felt so ripped off.  I think that is why Cabo currently has a low Yelp rating, because people are feeling ripped off. 
Overall, i would not come back here, because i believe it is a tourist trap.  They are banking on the one time diner, versus the returning diner."}
{"text":"So I came with low expectations, this is a place I normally would not go to since it's not my style and I'm rarely on the strip. However Chris told us about some specials and I love hanging with my group of Yelpies so I came along. 

The staff is awesome at this place!

Firstly, they went above the notch in honoring a drink special that was only for the 4th but we mistakenly thought was ongoing. Thank you to the manager, Roland, who was very nice in doing this for us and for checking in on us a few times in the night. 

Our server was spot on. Seriously- we were checked on often, water cups never empty, chips and salsa never empty until we friggin' were so stuffed and saying \"no more!!!\". Some of the best service I've had in a long time so a shoutout to Donnie. 

Sometime in the night they put on the \"Mas Tequila\" song and were giving out free shots at the bar. No glass here, the dancing ladies poured it into your mouth and poured as much as your mouth can handle. I dont know how often this happens.

I had a 2 for 1 frozen margarita (this is from a coupon) and got a regular margarita and a pina colada though there were a few other flavors to choose from (strawberry daquiri, orange creme and peach I think). It was hot on the patio and hey, I'm at a place called Cabo Wabo so might as well drink something beach-y. They weren't very strong, I probably wouldn't buzz if I didn't get the big shot of Tequila at the bar. They were refreshing none the less so for $10, it was not bad at all.

I wasn't feeling like eating something heavy (I was waiting for my BF to have dinner with) so I was just drinking and noshing on chips, but I took a bite of my buddy Nins chicken taquitos and dipped them in a cheese sauce. They were actually decent and the chicken was juicy. I think most of the food seems ok. I wouldnt go as a local out of my way to drive down there, but you're in the area, it might be fine. 

If you like Tex- Mex food, Sammy Hagar/classic rock blasting and a unpretentious atmosphere, a patio to people watch (and watch the Bellagio fountains) this might be a place for you.

I wasn't expecting to have a good night based on the negative reviews of service, but I am pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"The outdoor patio is a popular place for people watching and to be seen as it's on the corner of Planet Hollywood.  We opted to enter from inside and asked to be seated indoors which only had about 7 tables occupied.  Our server came promptly to get our drink orders.  I had checked in on Yelp which offered a free margarita ($10) value but I also had a coupon for 20% off (it's in the Miracle Mile coupon book).  I opted to get the free drink but after, I should have used the coupon, as the drink was too strong for me and I drank less than half.  My husband happily finished it for me though.

I focused on the tacos and fajitas on the menu.  The fajitas come for 1 or 2.  We shared the grilled sirloin fajitas and for $3 more we got beans and rice.  The food came out quick and the platter had lots of cut up beef and grilled peppers on it.  We each received 3 warm small tortillas wrapped in paper.  We devoured them pretty quick and asked for more.

Service was more attentive at the beginning of our meal and then died off.  It still wasn't very busy inside so it wasn't that the server was so busy.  The food was good, but I'm not sure if it was worth $42 for 2.  The drinks are about $14 each so it can add up.

There was a little stage set up when you first walk in but I don't know when bands play.  It seems more popular to sit outside, listen to music, and enjoy the Strip views."}
{"text":"To start with the bright side, the service was very good. Our waiter took the time to let me sample all the drinks at the front and then mixed two flavors. 

The food was pretty awful. The food was cold and very average for the price. I ordered an appetizer and it was 12.00 plus very cold. When I asked the other people everyone else had a complaint about the food too."}
{"text":"Their fish & chips were awesome and so was their service. Laura was really kind and always check up on us. The vibe is pretty chill. My girlfriend and I sat outside and it wasn't too bad, just a tad bit hot at night. Overall great experience will be back again! Oh and we got 20% from the Tix4tonight place!"}
{"text":"Great service, quick delivery of drinks and food. And delicious pork carnitas and short rib enchiladas!"}
{"text":"Sitting out on the patio, great way to people watch!  Brian, our server, was 'Johnny on the spot!'  Brought drinks just when we were finishing,  talked with us about our experience here at CWLV, and stopped by every now and then to check up on us.  Bring the house of Sammy Hagar, they had shit music on when I first got he re.   I requested some Sammy music and got a great set list of Sammy music, solo stuff, Van Halen, and Chickenfoot!
When I'm not in Cabo, this is where I get my Wabo!
Brian ROCKS!
Update:  Manager Kristin stopped by when she found out REDHEADS were in da house!  Thanks Kristin!"}
{"text":"Food was very good for what it was, and it came very quickly.  The speed on our order was especially good for being as full as it was and a Friday night.  We also never had to wait more than a couple minutes for our drinks.  

Price was still expensive with the drinks added in, but as far as pricing in Vegas goes it wasn't all that bad.  

The thing that made the price worth it was the excellent and friendly service we received from our waitress, Aia.  She was, as well as the rest of the staff, very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed.  

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went here for our first breakfast in Vegas. Service was speedy & our server was attentive and friendly! The food was awesome. They have a nice selection of breakfast cocktails/mimosas. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had the appitizer quesadilla. It was great. I wasn't sure, when it arrived, if it was going to be enough but it was plenty. i can't remember our servers name but she was fantastic. I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I swore I'd never come back here since the staff was so rude last time I was here.  Glad I did. Everyone was so nice and helpful. What a difference. Now if they could make the food more authentic, warmer, less salty and less Americanized it would be five stars!"}
{"text":"Pretty overpriced and overhyped \"Mexican\" food spot in Vegas. The wait is ridiculous if you want to sit outside, but you can be seated faster if you walk to the inside. I ordered a calamari appetizer that I thought was good, but found lots of just fried pieces of nothing in my food as well LOL. The waitress was hard to get ahold of, but it was pretty busy so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. 

They do however have some of the best salsa and chips I've tasted! We had to pay for them unlike other Mexican food establishments that offer them complementary, but it's vegas. 

Save your time and go elsewhere, unless youre just getting chips"}
{"text":"15 min for drink when they say there is a first time for everything it wasn't a lie. Very disappointed will need to find a new Latin American cuisine. Waited over 15 min and no chips or salsa want to make it a better experience for your customs TREAT EACH ONE LIKE THEY ARE IMPORTANT had me pour my own drink I am beyond livid trying to enjoy myself and have a great one should not even be a ? If you would pour my drink ! SMH"}
{"text":"Think overpriced (I know that's Vegas in general) chain restaurant.  I have been to the original in Mexico and the relation is apples and oranges. Food was not great and the atmosphere was nothing special. The waitress forgot part of food order and if it wasn't for the location and outside sitting area I would have given it 1 star. 

It's basically Mexican TGI Fridays. There are plenty of other non-chain Mexican restaurants on the strip if you have a craving for Mexican . 

Don't get fooled into thinking this is going to be anything like the original Cabo Wabo."}
{"text":"Typical Vegas...Way overpriced food and drinks. Food is average at best. Drinks are outrageous. Staff was very attentive and fun but they don't give you a little heads up on how badly your getting \"raped\". I was drinking Dos Equis in a plastic glass,,a little bigger than a bottle. 13 dollars a piece!!!! I asked the waiter: Are you serious ? Never again."}
{"text":"I came here by chance because the Oyster Bar line was too long and I could not wait any longer in line, so thought I would give Cabo Wabo Cantina a try.
It was mid afternoon and their was hardly anyone there except people sitting at the bar. I got seated pretty fast but then I had to wait 30 minutes for my food which I thought was long considering it was slow time. 

I got the pork tamales, it tasted okay, but I felt I could have just went to Roberto's for the same thing except with a cheaper price tag.

I don't know if Ill be going back"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!  I fell in love with the tamarind margarita. It's a must try!! I would also highly recommend the nachos with beef fajitas. 
The ambiance was fun and relaxed and the service was great!"}
{"text":"We stayed at Paris and were able to walk around the corner to Cabo Wabo (We actually went twice). First time, we had the guac and taquitos. The waiter claimed he couldn't split the guac between us 3. When we went today and got chips and salsa, the waitress split it for us without even asking. So clearly he just didn't want to do it for us. Kinda rubbed us the wrong way. Besides that, today I had the carne asada burrito queso style. It was awesome and hit the spot. Our service was pretty slow and our waitress didn't split our checks, there were 6 of us there! We had to wait til she came back so we could ask her to do individual checks. She made it seem like such a chore. Overall the food was pretty good but service could be improved."}
{"text":"We're here in Vegas for a few days and many of our friends have ate here and said it was good so now it's our turn.  Service was a little slow to start but once our server came by she was very quick with our drinks and answering questions. 

Food lookes and tastes great!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for a couple of cocktails because they had a nice rooftop patio where we could enjoy the sunshine. My frozen strawberry margarita here was the best frozen drink I had in Vegas (I had quite a few in the four days we were in Vegas!) The glass was frosty and kept the drink nice and cold.....flavor was perfect and the right strength.

Can't speak to the food because we didn't eat here but the service was great and we'd definitely go back for at least drinks the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"We loved our food. Chips and Salsa were great and huge portions. I ordered the chorizo and cheese appetizer and my husband ordered the chicken fajitas."}
{"text":"This place gets a bad rap. You have to take it for what it is. A Mexican food chain. It's not going to be authentic. It's going to be average. Get a drink, it'll taste better. Our food was good. My husband and I got the fajitas for two. Enough to fill both of us up. 

Server was hardly seen and it took 10 minutes just to get drinks, and that was from another server who saw that we had been waiting for another while. 

Also, they leave the doors open to outside. There was a serious breeze coming through which made it pretty cold. I would have much preferred to sit outside with a heater than inside with the cold! 

Also, if your bill comes to $24.11 and you give them $25 they will automatically keep the change. Our bill came to $6.11 after our groupon and gave $10. We only got the bills back. Not cool."}
{"text":"My husband and I visit Vegas often. This is our go to place for happy hour/reasonably priced Mexican food. You have the option to sit indoors or outdoors. We always sit outdoors which allows you to do some people watching and look around the heart of the strip. 

We order the Chicken Fajitas which are pretty delicious. We also checked in to get a free Margarita. 

What I don't like is that they now charge for chips and salsa which they never did before.  It also does take a long time for the waiters to attend to you."}
{"text":"If you travel frequently to Vegas and end up in Terminal C, check this spot out for a quick bite and drink. It wasn't so crazy overcrowded like the other options by C 12-c16... this is  in the newer section of Term C. But I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon it and I got a bar seat and fast service. Melissa was my server and she provided great service. I will be back for sure if and when I have time between flights. They had 2-3 sports games on for sports buffs this will be a hit. 

So the food is pretty good for bar food (you are not coming here for organics!), I had a burger cooked perfectly and the fries are decent (they put cheese on them, so request no cheese if that is an issue). They also had a decent Pinot Grigio available vs. their 2 chardonnays which I won't touch ever - so that was the saving grace for me. It is odd that they offer you a 9 oz or a 6 oz pour and literally measure it right in front of you - I am sure this is management's orders, but not so customer friendly. It cheapens the experience for sure. BUT with all that I would still go back because it was easy, fast, provided a good enough environment to spend an hour before my flight and had nice servers."}
{"text":"Great people watching. Fantastic drinks. Good sizes. Our server, aia was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Cabo Wabo. The food was good and so was my drink. The drink was a little pricey but it is on the strip. The chips and salsa was really good. The chips were fresh and so was the salsa. We sat outside and it was nice to see the strip. The outside area is a little tight for space but it's not that bad."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch hour and sat inside because it was wayyy to hot outside. We were seated immediately and our waitress was very friendly and attentive. I enjoyed the atmosphere, relaxing but fun. The food was good... just got some tacos and a lot of coronas. Overall, I thought the prices were reasonable and I would come back again."}
{"text":"I'm surprised Cabo Wabo doesn't have better reviews.  I'm picky as shit and so are my friends- we are there twice last trip to Vegas- and loved it!! We had a Groupon and went for dinner- because we needed quick and close- and were blown away by how good it was! The drinks were awesome- mojitos the best! And their chips for salsa- were thick and perfectly made. It was so good we went back for breakfast! Something we never do as we want to try different places.  Breakfast was the best!!! They have a great selection of Mexican breakfasts. And you get a lot of good for your money! In fact this was better then some of the crappy restaurants around and half the price.  I'm so glad we took a chance on this place!"}
{"text":"The happy hour tacos were soooo good. They were flavorful and the service was quick. We tried the Naughty Santa shot. Just wanted a light snack before a show. Everyone at the establishment was friendly and engaging."}
{"text":"This place met expectations. I have been to the one in Cabo and wanted to go to the one in Vegas. Got a groupon which made it a great deal. I had the nachos off the appetizer list. They were to die for. It was big enough for three people. I would definately eat here again."}
{"text":"Ok so I came here with my 5 friends at first I thought it was going to be just another chain restaurant that had average food like most American commercial chains.
This place is far above that , they have kept the culture of the place and had an exceptionally high standard  of food.
We had to start wings which were great.
Guacamole with chips and margaritas.
We then had 2 ribs, 2chicken jalepeno both dishes were great and had more margaritas , come on we are in Vegas you have to have margaritas with every thing!
I recommend sitting outside and enjoying the live music it's also a great people watching locations as it has a little bit of hight on the balcony .
The price is great for Vegas standards I think the ribs were $23 and they were MASSIVE servings."}
{"text":"Limited gluten free options. We planned on eating here but opted just to get chips and salsa with a pitcher instead. One of the best Pina coladas I've had!"}
{"text":"I was really expecting more for being in a pretty decent location in Las Vegas.  The food was really sub par - I had three styles of the soft shell tacos and two were very dry.  Also when I ordered a \"bottle\" of Miller Lite from the menu it came in a can... I know its only Miller Lite but if I order it in a bottle I expect a bottle...

The service on the other hand was very good, attentive and on top of things.  There was no \"push\" to turn the table and get another tip which was nice in that type of setting.  Unfortunately the food was not very good and with so many other choices in the area I don't know if I would venture in to give another meal a shot."}
{"text":"We walked past this place several times and knew we wanted to give it a try.  We made it in for breakfast and it was awesome.  The breakfast quesadilla was one of the best things I've ever eaten.  If you go for breakfast/brunch, the coffee cocktail was great!  Service was awesome too!"}
{"text":"On a sunny morning this is a good place to enjoy a breakfast burrito out on the patio and people watch."}
{"text":"NOT REAL MEXICAN FOOD! I wouldve to say that their food here is not real authentic, their services here is horrible! Took me 20 mins just to get the bartenders attention to order my food to go and to top it off it wasnt even busy! Being a restaurant on the strip and in the miracle mile I would really think their service would be top notch."}
{"text":"Yuck. Cabo Wabo is really just an overpriced Chili's. Salsa was flavorless, beans were flavorless also. The tacos were bland tasting and were made with what seems like cheap ingredients, like they use a Chili's Restaurant food vendor like a US Foods, frozen and not fresh.. So bland and generic. The tortillas had gotten cold so they were chewy, the rice was also cold upon arrival. NOT worth it, save your money and go to Nacho Daddy. Or you can just spend it all on liquor, that is always worth it. If you are a tourist and don't care about great tasting Mexican food and you love Del taco then this is the place for you!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner to celebrate my friends 22nd birthday and it was great! The staff was super friendly, fast, and attentive to all our needs. Especially Stephanie our waitress and Cuco our busser! Definitely coming back on my next trip out to Vegas !"}
{"text":"Food was ok but to have a frontview seat of the strip in all its glory, right across from the Bellagio water show, while watching all the drunk misfits on Vegas Blvd all while sipping a margarita, this is your spot."}
{"text":"Fun place! Best salsa in town! Food is reasonably priced for Las Vegas.  

But good drinks fun people"}
{"text":"This was a 5 star for me... I am a pretty \"clean\" eater and was a bit worried I wasn't going to find something that would  fit my meal plan.
However, they were happy to help and did a Grilled Chicken Breast with a sides of salsa and jalape√±os. It was very filling and wonderful! 
Service was prompt and friendly.
Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Great food! Ended up eating inside, close enough to the patio that you can hear the live music. Which was pretty great. 

We had ordered the chicken fajitas to share, which was yummy! They accidentally brought us the dirty Mexican rice instead of the rice and beans. Which was a great mistake because it was incredible! 

Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So disappointing. In Vegas for a convention and noticed the Yelp deal for a free margarita with check in so my coworker and I planned our night around Cabo Wabo for dinner. Let me tell you - the Yelp deal is SO NOT WORTH IT.  

The on the house yelp Margarita was way way way way too sweet.  It was like a bunch of sugar with a tiny splash of lime and tequila.  I would have rather dined at another place than wasting my time.  My carne asade tacos themselves were good, but the rice and beans were cold.  Like they were just sitting in the back in a silver bin waiting to be served to the next victim. 

Lastly, the server seemed attentive but really wasn't.  After asking him - TWICE - for some hot sauce for me meal he then questioned why I would need it and asked wasn't the salsa on the tacos hot enough?

Thanks yelp for the incentive but next time I'll definitely pass."}
{"text":"There was no wait, waitresses dress in cute cut-up shirts and most are good-looking, GREAT music, and they have a cool gallery where they have a pic of my fav country singer Toby Keith, I enjoyed that very much. 

Now as for food, the salsa was amazing, I loved it, boyfriend thought it could use more spice. Waitress kept trying to force us to buy drinks, but we didn't want to get too wasted and not be able to go out on the strip late-night so we just ordered waters. As for entrees I ordered the chicken fajitas, they were okay kind of bland and the seasoning had a funny flavor going on. Boyfriend has the carnitas platter and he said it was \"better than expected for american mexican food.\"

The big negative was that our waitress didn't come pick up our check . We waited for about 30mins and ended up giving it to another waitress.

All in all atmosphere was great, food was decent, service wasn't too good, but they do give you a little postcard with your picture on it that you can use for 20%off your next visit which is a nice souvenir."}
{"text":"Great little place to rest after a hot walk in Vegas! They have a patio with misters to beat the heat. Also their food was very delicious. I had one of the specials, it was good, can't pronounce it or even attempt to spell it, but it was good. The Jalape√±o Picante margarita was amazing! Mangos, jalape√±os, tequila, and spicy salt. Mmmmm.  Service was very good. Waiter was friendly and very helpful. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"In Vegas for few days........one of our first stops on the strip was Cabo Wabo Cantina. Needless to say, it was not our last visit!!!  The food was great but the service was even better.  Ask for Laura if she is available.........what a sweet girl and great server. 
As far as bartenders........OMG,, Kristy will have you splitting your sides laughing and she makes the most AWESOME MARGARITA!!!!!!!!!!!!   All around good experience."}
{"text":"Had the hand stirred pina colada with agave rim & roasted coconut flakes! It was definitely a cocktail to remember. Shared the red enchiladas plate with rice and beans, since we weren't too hungry. It was the perfect combination for a relaxing brunch on a beautiful day! The view and weather was great... we will be back! Especially since we are sister states. See you soon Cabo Wabo!"}
{"text":"Our final Saturday evening meal in Las Vegas was supposed to be at Burgr, but the line wrapped around the casino. So we decided to go to Cabo Wabo. We were seated inside right away. Not very busy around 5pm. The waitress was nice and attentive. Our food and drinks came quickly.

I ordered the chicken quesadilla, which was quite possibly the best I've ever had. The tortilla was extremely thin and crisp. It came with the perfect portion of rice and beans. The side of guacamole and sauce went really well with it. I'd definitely come back. For 4 entrees and 2 drinks we paid about $25 each after we split the bill with tip. I think the prices are what's expected of Vegas, but of course over priced for the food you get especially the drinks. I paid $12 for a tall beer on tap."}
{"text":"Note:  we were under the influence during this meal!

Chicken fajitas were well flavored and juicy.  The portion size was pretty large.  Gotta love homemade tortillas (at least they looked homemade).  We also ordered queso.  It had a unique taste that at first I wasn't sure of, but it grew on me over time.  The salsa was a highlight of the meal with a smoky flavor."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for drinks. Rock Daddy was playing, not too bad of a band (80s and 90s rock). Went outside to sit and people watch for a little bit since there are tables right on the Strip. Too cold, so went back inside. Surrounding people were all very nice. The bartenders were all really cool, too. Generous pours , huge shots, and not ridiculous prices for drinks. 

Some people were still ordering food even though it was late. I did not try the food but the smell of all of the fajitas when they were brought by started to make me nauseous. 

Supposedly all of the bands have to play Sammy songs as part of their sets. It's a requirement to play there. The only song I heard when I was there was \"Can't Drive 55\"."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for happy hour. 
Margaritas were good, sangria was so-so, nachos were delicious, wings were fantastic, service was great and location and patio were wonderful. 
I will def go back for happy hour during my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food and drink !!! Great place eat having a few margaritas sit on patio and people watch."}
{"text":"My margarita was perfect. Chips were good and salsa was amazing. The music drew us in. We really wanted to eat but way too expensive, but I guess we were on the strip with an amazing view, so it's expected. Our waiter Anthony was awesome and very attentive."}
{"text":"Great little place to come have a drink 
And little quick stop if you're walking  the strip and you want a quick sit down drink and snacks 
They have a greasy little snack menu 
Great chips and salsa and guacamole
Prices are ok 
Drinks can use a little help 
Service was great tonight that we came the man that served us loves what he does and he was amazing 
Restrooms are all the way back there if you are sitting outside 
Inside have a cute little country touch"}
{"text":"Wonderful!!! Average price for Vegas. But incredible drinks, even better food and even BETTER service! Joe was our server and he's so friendly, attentive and not pushy. Chicken tacos and the best and chicken enchiladas are wonderful. I will absolutely return."}
{"text":"This is always our go-to spot when we visit Las Vegas because the service is always amazing, super fast, it's not over priced like the other restaurants on the strip, and the food is amazing! 
The last time we went, we had the shrimp tacos, fish tacos, nacho platter, and a pitcher of the CW Margarita. In the past we've had the enchiladas, chicken plate, and all of the above has always been amazing! There is even a patio area located right along the strip so you can enjoy awesome views of the Bellagio Fountain!
I've always wished there was a Cabo Wabo exactly the same as this here in LA but unfortunately there isn't. Can't wait to be back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast!!! If you're staying on the strip and don't want a super expensive breakfast at one of the hotels, definitely check out cabo wabo. I highly recommend the CW eggs Benedict and the breakfast quesadilla. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"*Pitchers aren't happy hour*

Went for Happy Hour for drinks. The waitress said that margaritas are half off so we ordered a pitcher. When we got the bill the waitress then told us that only individual glasses of margaritas are Happy Hour, not pitchers."}
{"text":"Very bad, rude and bitchy service. My cousin and I baught drinks while on our way out and our server at the bar was just so rude! She's fortunate I don't remember her name but I think she was one of the supervisors (because she was telling people what to do and ppl came to her for things) and she was not pleasant. The way she talked to us was just bitchy! I do t know how else to explain it.

Las Vegas is one of the most popular vacation cities and you need to work on your customer service because you never know who's gonna write about you on Yelp!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch at Cabo Wabo when we got tired of wandering around The Strip. The outdoor seating in the sunshine was definitely a huge draw. Still a bit chilly in the shade, but they had heat lamps. Bonus: there was a decent view of the Bellagio fountains. 

It may be a Mexican food chain, but I thought the food was fine. The service was great too. Friendly and attentive. Even though there were vegetarian options on the menu, we stuck to appetizers. The salsa had a smoky flavor, and the guacamole was good. We also shared a cheese crisp, which was similar to a cheese quesadilla. Overall, not the cheapest spot for food and drinks, but it is Vegas after all."}
{"text":"Ask for ITSEL SHE IS SO AWESOME!!!! 

VERY cute and very sweeet. 

She was super helpful and happy. She deserves her job!"}
{"text":"Sure.. Tourist trap! But excellent service, good coffee, and the Eggs Benedict was soooo good! It was so windy and cold when we were here so we couldn't sit outside on the cool deck overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Oh well

Decor looks like Margaritaville a block away, but I think the food was better here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate lunch on 5/5/2015.  We had the Short Rib Enchiladas and the Chicken Tostada Salad.  Both were very good, and the service was great also.  We were surprised how good the food was for a novelty chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Due to the plethora of reviews, I will summarize my comments via bullet point:
-Great and personable bar tenders
-Classic and spicy Bloody Mary (lovely cure for rough mornings)
-Go with the any of their chicken breast meals
-Great people watching during the day
-Gets a bit douchey at night.

Collectively, not a bad place to spend an afternoon."}
{"text":"Very delicious food and good service. Will come back. 
We had baja fish taco and carne asada tacos. Both really good. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, pretty good drinks, expensive but that is typical for Vegas.  The best part about this place is when they play Mas Tequila you run to the bar where the wait staff is waiting standing on top of the bar to pour tequila right into your mouth.  Pretty good tequila too.  Go on Sunday night when the have karaoke to a live band.  VERY FUN!  We went the end of August this year and it was not very crowded.  I will for sure be back the next time I am in Vegas which I hope is soon!"}
{"text":"Great location right in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip. Service was super friendly and the food was yummy. Large portion sizes and reasonable prices considering the prime location.
I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Way overpriced, even for Vegas. The food is an embarrassment. \"Nachos\" are six chips on a plate with a sprinkle of cheese. I would expect much better from the Red Rocker. You're dead to me Sammy."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice. 

Service was good. Server told us about the drinks happy hour. 

Food was decent. I would come back to eat here."}
{"text":"$14 for a draft beer? Only reason I stopped was because we had walked all day. I know the strip can be pricey but come on!!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was slow. The tamarind margarita was awesome! The chicken with cheese was very flavorful."}
{"text":"This spot was awesome, great location outside on the strip. Music playing, and our server Nathan was knowledgeable and cool."}
{"text":"We have loved visiting Cabo Wabo on recent Vegas trips. We like to belly up to the bar to people watch and take in the Bellagio fountains from a distance. I had shrimp tacos on this visit, subbing chips and salsa for rice and beans. I would have preferred grilled shrimp over fried, but I still enjoyed the tacos. My husband had the lobster burrito. He gives it a 7/10. We both left satisfied. The price is what it is...you're on the strip. Service was great on the patio. We will continue to return. 
Also, live music on a Tuesday night at 8:30 just as we were finishing. He was entertaining."}
{"text":"No surprise. Very basic grub served by tough looking staff. Overpriced. You get what you would expect from something owned by Sammy Hagar. Only went to take advantage of deal for frozen margaritas - meh. Skip it unless you are DESPERATE."}
{"text":"I started here on a club crawl. They were very nice to us. They put out appetizers and chips and dips. Drinks were fine but a bit pricy. Should have been able to pick our own shot. The one they gave us was awful."}
{"text":"Empty dining room at 7:30 pm?  Should've know it would suck.  If I'm paying $20 bucks for below-mediocre tex mex could I have a glass instead of a frat party plastic cup?  I'm trying to think of something that I liked about this place besides my company and I can only come up with \"well, at least I didn't get food poisoning\"."}
{"text":"This place is fun and a party time.  We sat at the outside bar and the staff was great.  Drinks were fantastic and really enjoyed the Taquitos.  Great place to party.  Cinco de Mayo party was great, especially the music."}
{"text":"After seeing \"Vegas the Show\" we were famished and needed a bite to eat before hitting a club.  We stopped at Cabo Wabo Cantina for an appetizer sampler.  To call the food mediocre would be generous.  The chips came from a bag.  There was fat in the meat on the nachos and everything was greasy.  It was loud as a club in the empty restaurant for no reason at all.

On the plus side: our waitress was friendly.

Also, there is a \"franchise fee\" tacked onto each bill.  They do not tell you this ahead of time.  I have never seen this done anywhere else.  It is a percentage of your bill, so BEWARE!"}
{"text":"The epic debate of how many stars to give! Almost gave 3, but...
First off, on the food, I've had only had the guacamole and I loved it. I'm an admitted avocado whore so it's hard to not make me love guac. 
Usually when I come to Cabo Wabo it's to have drinks outside and people watch (perfect spot for it).
I would give this place 5 stars if I could always sit at the bar top outside... primarily because that's how I know my drinks are amazing! And I do mean amazing. Whenever I've ordered a drink from a server, it tends to come to me...not what I had ordered (hence 3 stars). I'll admit when it comes to margaritas I'm relatively particular, but I'm pretty clear about what I'm looking for. 
Either way, it's still my favorite \"cantina\" on the strip, and will always fight for a seat at the bar top. Wait, I'm off tomorrow! I'm so overdue."}
{"text":"First night in Vegas. Saw the fountains then headed over for a drink. Just for checking in on yelp I got a free voucher for a margarita with the purchase of an entree. I don't like margaritas but as a teacher getting something for free brings a smile to my face. 

We sat at the inside bar
Waiting for a seat on the rail outside so we could watch everything. There was a band upstairs also. This place is owned by Sammy Hagar and his beer Red Head is on draft. If your in Vegas it's worth a stop."}
{"text":"I came here for the new Santo Mezquila and my Waborita fix (and to satisfy my need to add another Sammy shirt to my collection).  A forever fan of the Cabo.... Happy hour shots are $5.  Yes sir may I have another!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was awesome but we had a HORRIBLE experience with a manager named Ryan. He made us feel like we were in the wrong and very uncomfortable when we wanted to change an order. We will not be returning because of him."}
{"text":"The food is standard Tex Mex fare, but the shining aspect of Cabo Wabo is their staff. The wait for a table was close to half an hour, on a weekday, so we sat at the bar. One of the barbacks, Chris(?), was phenomenal. He took care of us from start to finish. 

The signature margarita was good, but the coconut one was the best. It is similar to a daiquiri. 

The food teetered on okay to good. The bacon wrapped shrimp was delicious, but it is hard not to love goat cheese stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon and then fried. The rice needs a little work. Not much flavor there. The tuna ceviche is closer to a tartar. It borderlines on the sweet side. The spicy shrimp with garlic chips was one of the better dishes. It had a balance of flavors and not just overtly spice levels.

Jason, the GM, came by to talk to us and was very friendly. It is refreshing to see management touch the tables and actually care about the guest's experience. Adam, another manager came around to introduce himself as well. It was a fun service experience. I would like to come back when I have more free time to check out their tequila selection."}
{"text":"Good food at reasonable prices, especially for Las Vegas. A bonus the have Coke products in an area where it is all Pepsi!  Pete was our server and he was friendly and made sure we were taken care  of.  Food proportions were plentiful, but not so much that you are wasting tons of food. It looks like it is hopping later in the day, but it is quiet in the morning. I definitely recommend it for breakfast."}
{"text":"It does not get better than this on a Spring day, with chairs on the patio and chips and queso! I wasn't really a fan of their sangria, it was the weakest I've ever had. If you want to sit and relax and have a view of the strip this is the best spot! But as far as drinks go, at least the sangria....pass! the waitresses are very nice. had a spill and they were very fast to come with water and napkins for our little mess. Vibe is so chill and lovely spot to see the whole strip action."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service and awesome margaritas on the patio made for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Really not much here to say. The location overlooking the strip is amazing. City center and Bellaggio's fountains are across the street. The food and drinks are mediocre. But the food is overpriced and the drinks are wayyyyy overpriced. Seriously, $11 for a margarita served in a plastic cup and a $9 beer. Stay clear. Go to the lounge in Cosmopolitan for similar prices. 

Exc - View
Good - None
Ave -Food
Poor -WAYYY overpriced

WOULD I GO BACK? No."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night during a rush and were seated on the patio (our preference) within 10 minutes. We had the pleasure of having Danny as our sever-he was fabulous!! Attentive, fun, and charming. Do yourself a favor-come here and enjoy a delicious margarita and live music!"}
{"text":"John bartender at this joint is by far welcoming and responsive.  Although it was a short visit dude took care of me and I am very appreciative....Dennis Rodman was here during the night however it was calmly handled...it was my birthday and John took care of me....appreciate the restaurant vibe as well as John."}
{"text":"My first trip to Vegas and we went to Cabo every night. The drinks were amazing. Being able to get pitchers of mixed drinks was awesome. Yes it's pricey but so is everywhere you go in Vegas. 
Our waitress is what really gave it the 5th star. Her name was Laura and she was great. Very friendly everytime we came in. 
If you are in Vegas you need to go to Sammy Hagars Cabo Wabo!"}
{"text":"Worst experience in Vegas.  No one knew how to light the heat lamps.   No rice and beans with fajitas until we asked and then were told they were extra. Fine, so offer it when we order, dude! And then the waiter stood and waited for us to pay when he dropped the check. Really? You're gonna hover over me after you drop the check? Ghetto!"}
{"text":"Order a steak burrito and got a rice burrito. They bearly put any meat on my burrito. I decided just to throw it away and write this review."}
{"text":"I've been to Cabo Wabo a couple of times and while it's pricey for what you get, it's Vegas and that's how every place is.  At least at Cabo Wabo, you can sit outside and people watch while you eat and drink.  The tacos are fairly good and the drinks don't have to be sweet if you ask for them to be that way.  Service was pretty good and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was wanting one of those humongous margarita's everyone was walking around town with.  I got a pina colada flavor and the whole thing was a giant slushy. No alcohol taste whatsoever. I guess I paid the price for falling into the the tourist trap type drinks. Not doing that again."}
{"text":"This was a fun environment. The food tasted good, just a little pricey. My husband had a quesadilla that was coated in a Parmesan cheese that was great! I had the appetizer chicken taquitos that made for a nice small meal. You did have to pay for chips and salsa which I'm not used to. Our waitress was friendly as well."}
{"text":"Bad, bad,bad and BAD! Right from the beginning with had issues with this place, as soon as we walked in, the host wanted us to sit in the middle of the restaurant, right in front of the sun, we explained her that we don't want to be in the sun so she suggested another table, IN THE SUN. We pointed out that there are at least 15 other tables that are not in the sun, so she finally allowed us to sit there, while mumbling something about \"how she just sat someone else in this area\" (Not sure what she meant by that, but didn't really care). 

After that, It took forever to order, then, I asked for Ketchup and they totally ignored me, after 10 mins I asked from someone else for ketchup, then I finally got it.  The food was OK but nothing special. 

Skip that one."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD
Great view
TERRIBLE service

We sat first, couple to the right got served their drinks before us, we ordered an appetizer, guy to the left sat after us and got his appetizer before us.  Our waitress THEN came back w/out drinks to ID us after about 10 mins of waiting. I was not a happy camper. Appetizer never showed, dinner came, and unfortunately it was really good. BUT I'd never go back.  Go to Border Grille or the Mexican place in the shopping center across from the Wynn. 

But don't go here."}
{"text":"Cabo Wabo for breakfast. The breakfast special is a great deal and well worth it. The Mexican Omlette is delicious. The Breakfast Burrito is great. The Bloody Mary was ok not the best not the worst.  The Mimosa was good. The frozen margarita was good. The service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Cool place, the server was great!  Had a Denver omelet which was very good, great margaritas, and a flight of Cabo Wabo tequila.   Will definitely be going back here on the next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Not a very pleasant experience as I had set a very high expectations for this place. We were a party of 8, got a table and until that point everything was OK, the wait wasn't too bad. Off coarse, we get a waiter that all hyped up and was rushing us to order, I ask for some Salsa and Chips, he acted all surprised and said that he will charge me for it, OK, no problem. Then we go on and I asked for a green salsa and his reply was \"you can have whatever you want\" not to mention he was going to tag me with additional $9.00 for Guacamole dip, well I asked for green Salsa not a dip. We go on without any complaints as we all felt the situation was weird. The food comes in, I ordered the fish of the day, Scottish Salmon, good plate presentation until the plate tasted like all SALT, went on and tried to eat as we were all starving, it got to the point where I could not continue. Mentioned it to the MOD and she did a great job by addressing it. Bottom line, it wasn't a well perceived experience."}
{"text":"Okay, so the margaritas aren't great. The food isn't either. The music is mostly annoying, BUT the chips are really delicious. They're like the perfect thickness, warm, and salty. Just perfect. It's a good (unhealthy) snack when you're stuck near Planet Hollywood and need to burn some time."}
{"text":"Great drinks. Incredibly rude service. Very unfortunate"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, drinks were on point and the service was fantastic. Thanks Bernard!!!"}
{"text":"good spot for people watching -but the service is rude and beer was warm and slow to arrive."}
{"text":"The Cabo Wabo Cantina is one of my favorite places to visit every time I go to Las Vegas! 

They have an awesome deck that is right on the strip just outside of Planet Hollywood.  One of the best people watching areas in the country!  Combine that with awesome service, solid food and great drinks and you've got yourself a great time!

Our most recent visit was on 10/20/14.  We were pleasantly greeted and opted for a table right on the rail so we could enjoy the sights.  I will say that they now pump in music...and my previous choice of the bar style seating is now less desirable because the music would be a bit loud there (wait, did I just say that?  music is NEVER too loud..but you get what I mean).

Our server, Ashley, was very nice, kept our drinks filled and provided great service....consistent with every single time we've visited Cabo Wabo! 4 or 5 times there and we've always been very well taken care of.

I tried a few different drinks...a cucumber based margarita...a 'sangarita' (their twist on a sangria, it's pinot noir and tequila) which was better than I anticipated but probably wouldn't get it again, and the standard ol' Waborita, which is my ultimate favorite.

The food is consistently good.  You DO have to pay for chips and salsa (only a couple bucks though) and the salsa is worth it..very tasty.  I used to get the tequila shrimp, but they've removed it from the menu so this time I had the fish tacos (with chipotle crema), while my date had the carne asada tacos (which looked and were delicious..and included avacado!).  It's not 5 star food, but it's way better than normal bar food.

Ultimately it's the combination of location, atmosphere, service, drinks and food that makes Cabo Wabo a winner.  Grab a seat on the rail, a Waborita and enjoy the sights and sounds of the Vegas strip!"}
{"text":"Betsy was the best server. Week night. The food, server. All amazing. Couldn't, wouldn't complain. Amazing over all."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Sat outside and people-watched on Las Vegas Blvd. Fish tacos were delicious and served with a side of refried beans and rice. The Cabo frozen margarita was AWESOME, both the original and mango version. Wonderfully refreshing on a 97-degree afternoon. Server was very good. Only reason I didn't award them 5 stars is that I found the menu items a bit pricey, even for Vegas. Even so, I would go back, if only for their margaritas!"}
{"text":"After missing out on trying the Bacchanal buffet with my friends (I got in a few hours later than they did), I was determined to try something new so that I would still have something else to write about.  Fortunately/unfortunately, that \"something new\" ended up being Cabo Wabo...which always seemed like more of a drinking spot than as a place to eat at.  Now I know why!

Although Cabo Wabo isn't a mainstream type of chain restaurant, it's still pretty much a chain, and the food really reflected that.  I kept expectations to a minimum for my CARNITAS TACOS, and what I got was pretty mediocre...and overpriced.  Two tacos, Spanish rice, and beans for $15?  I know it's The Strip and all, but damn (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cabo-wabo-cantina-las-vegas?select=vguZqf4mTUutzMe9wgw8Sw#J9PUAWgzOp0UnrzmnXG4bg).  The taste of the carnitas was driven heavily by their generic sauce rather than the savory, seasoned flavors you'd get from something authentic, but at least the tacos were fairly full...so yay?

As far as our drinks went, my friends seemed mostly satisfied with what they had.  I ordered the CHUPA CHUPA cocktail, which was kind of fun to drink but not particularly amazing.  Essentially, they flip a mini Corona into a regular margarita at your table, and you have to quickly drink it before it all overflows (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cabo-wabo-cantina-las-vegas?select=vguZqf4mTUutzMe9wgw8Sw#RV-cRSWcsgg5ITs4n6OcAQ).  Creative and unique, but pricey considering it wasn't that heavy on the alcohol.
 
Amazingly though, what hurt more than overpaying for generic and medicore food was my lack of reception stopping me from checking in on Yelp when we first sat down.  As petty and trivial as that sounds, I would have seen the \"Free margarita with the purchase of an entr√©e\" deal before I ordered, and I could have saved myself $12 on that Chupa Chupa!  Ugh..."}
{"text":"I go to Cabo Wabo every time I come to Vegas. The margaritas are strong and some of the best I've had. I always order the Cocorita but am often tempted by other enticing drinks on their large menu. 

They do not serve free chips and salsa, which is unfortunate for a Mexican restaurant but I go there for the nachos so I don't mind. The nacho platter with carne asada is my go-to and perfect as a meal for two people, alongside some ice cold margaritas. 

I always come to Vegas during the most crowded times of the year and have never had to wait to sit inside. There is usually a wait for outside seating, which overlooks the strip."}
{"text":"Although the margaritas were tasty, they were pretty expensive!! And honestly I had a hard time finishing my grilled fish tacos, they just weren't  that great, my dad had the lobster enchilada and that was ok, I also tasted the Cadillac nachos, all in all nothing special. Good location mediocre food over priced drinks. Nothing surprising here"}
{"text":"Love love love  love, LOVE Cabo Wabo. Make a special trip every year to the Tahoe location for my birthday. I've been to the Vegas location once before and wasn't overly excited. But this last trip, once again, made me fall in love all over again! I eat nachos ONCE A YEAR and Cabo Wabo is my only choice. The server suggested shrimp on my nachos. Freaking amazing. Great margaritas too. Good Service. Really nice patio with great people watching. Can't wait to go back. Counting down. Oh, and strangely enough, my boyfriend tried their burger (I know right, burger--at a Mexican restaurant?) and said it was to die for!"}
{"text":"I was in las vegas staying at the Paris hotel for my sisters bachelorette weekend and we decided to come here for breakfast before walking the whole strip. I thought it was way too early to drink so I didnt get to taste the drinks but the girls said they were strong and good. I don't recall the name of what I had for breakfast but do remember finishing the whole plate and it was just what i needed. In fact, all the girls devoured most of their food. We were at the outdoors seating and it was nice for people watching, and to plan our next adventure. I would return here on MY future bachelorette weekend !!"}
{"text":"We had a bit of a service problem at lunch time. We couldn't get refills in a timely manner and it took some time to get through the meal. It's better than Yolo's and the other Mexican food I had there but it's not up to that Texas - Cali Mexican food level.

That said - the quesadillas were fantastic. They have a nice crust to the outside that I hadn't seen before. The queso was below average in my mind but the drinks were good and it was a nice place. Again, this whole no free chips and salsa thing kind of blows my mind when getting Mexican food..."}
{"text":"If you come here, ask for Danny.  This guy will definitely make sure you're taken care of.    Tacos were awesome!  Margaritas are some of the better ones I've found on the strip!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here before heading out to a show because one of my friends that we were with has a little bro who's obsessed with Sammy Hagar. The place was pretty empty, so we got seated quickly.

For a place that's named after a tequila brand, I was expecting WAY more from my margarita. Super, super sugary and not much tequila taste, and no where near enough salt.

The place gets 2 stars because the nachos were really good. They're \"build your own\" and over priced, but tasty and a HUGE amount. But they arrived just a couple min before the rest of our food. And the rest of the food was TERRIBLE. My husband said the fish tacos were just ok, and everything on my combo plate was bland and greasy. 

Service was super slow for an empty restaurant, but the girl who came around to take pics was nice, and the hostesses let us snag a menu for my friend's bro.

We ate at Salsa Cantina in Miracle Mile a couple nights before and it was SOOOO much better, even the margaritas, and cheaper. Save yourself the trip to Cabo Wabo unless you're drinking Modelo on the patio to people watch... bottled beer they can handle."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday mid-afternoon and were pleased to hear that buckets (6) of beer were only $20 - NOWHERE I found on the strip had buckets for less than $35 so that was a nice price break!

We had THE BEST server... very cool, conversational, fun and handsome.  We really enjoyed our time with him.  

We each ordered a chicken and a beef taco.  The flavor of the tacos was good and it was great to see a place claiming to serve Mexican food ACTUALLY USE MEXICAN CHEESE!   But $13 for two tacos was a little steep, regardless of how good they are.

Overall, my experience seems to be better than some on here...but YES it is a tourist trap.  And if I could offer a suggestion - when in Vegas - try your hardest to avoid female servers/waitresses/bartenders.  They are all so sick of drunk tourist and/or businessmen hitting on them non-stop that they all have a chip on their shoulder.  Avoid them."}
{"text":"What a fantastic afternoon of day-drinking. Sat at the bar and Shane was our server. Such a fun guy- lots of conversation about the area, kept us hydrated with his phenomenal cocktails, and the food was tasty as well. Going back tomorrow for breakfast. Check it out - great drinks, great food, and GREAT TIMES!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places!!! It's so much fun! Great place for large groups!!! Definitely a must go when in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars but I'll round up because everything in Vegas is pricey. 

The atmosphere about this place is cool.  So for those tired of going to upscale Vegas restaurants, this is a good place to chill and drink some frozen margaritas and relax.  Especially a good way to get out of the Vegas heat.

Order the Carne Asada tacos and it was nothing special.  Tacos were a little small but it was good.   But its no way it should be 17 dollars.  Anywhere else and this would be a taco plate appetizer.  Grabbed some shots of tequila that were $11 dollars as well.  Overall just a meh experience. 

Again the 3 stars is generous because everything in Vegas is high.  And our waitress was really cool.  But otherwise it would be more towards that 2-2.5 range."}
{"text":"Cabo Wabo averages 2.5 stars so let's face it I didn't choose it for the menu or service. This place does have a few great things going for it- they took our reservation of 14 (tough to find on the strip without a set menu), there is a beautiful patio located in the middle of the strip (with a view of the Bellagio fountains), it's a fun atmosphere with music, and the price point is low. Sold!

So why only 3 stars? We should have been assigned our own server with a group our size, but we weren't. It took forever to get chips/salsa (which they charge for!), I got my drink after my meal though I ordered it long before, and a couple of the orders were wrong. I asked for no onions or sour cream on my tostada and it had both. Also, one of the girl's tostadas was missing the tostada (no tortillas)! Not sure who else's order was screwed up.

The food was actually really good, no complaints there. But my big complaint was when the checks came (we had 7 checks) I left to go deal with our transportation at this point... I got back 20 minutes later and checks were still sitting there with our cash/credit cards. As you can imagine our hummer limo waited for an extra 30 minutes for us and I paid about $40 more because of it. Not happy with the service here at Cabo Wabo."}
{"text":"Um....is there booze in those things!? This review is for the \"to-go\" frozen drink stand only. Seriously. Go for the 'extra shot' deal. They may be expensive, but they don't taste like they have alcohol in them. They are OK in flavor....definitely mix the Pina Colada with Strawberry."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre and pricey. All of their tacos are soft shelled except for one of them, so I was forced to get that one because they pre make them so they couldn't switch out the shell and I hate soft shell tacos. 

Tacos come with rice and refried beans which I didn't want, so I asked for double rice. I think they forgot that I asked for double rice. I'm kind of glad they did because the rice was dry and unflavorful. I literally had to drown it in salt and pepper. The tacos were good. They were the beef ones without any dairy, added avocado and cilantro. 

We got the bill and we were charged some odd fee. I asked the waiter about it and apparently it's because they are in the Planet Hollywood mall, so they pass it on to the customer. NOT COOL. I won't be going back for expensive, mediocre food and ridiculous fees on top of it."}
{"text":"Best dinner! Ask for Loriana as your server, she is a BOSS! So attentive and fun. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Omg Cabo wabo is the full Mexican experience.  I haven't had tacos this bomb since TJ.  Bartenders  are hello kool.  Mt new bar tender homeroom is getting  down with the mix drinks.  I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Our group ordered the appetizer sampler to share. It was okay but I think the only reason I thought that was because I was starving. In retrospect, it probably wasn't that good. The short rib taco I got was okay as well. Portions were very large and they have a good variety of drinks. They do have a nice patio overlooking the strip. Service was good."}
{"text":"Cabo Wabo has some tasty food and is one of my favorite places to eat and drink in Vegas.  We love the outside patio area at night or during the day.  They do have misters' on a warm Vegas day to cool you off on the patio.  The breakfast here is good too.  The fish tacos and shrimp tacos are both great.  The chorizo queso is excellent, and the chips and salsa are also great.  The drink prices are kind of high, but you get an awesome view of the strip.  If you want some tasty food or a good drink go here and try to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"ROACHES! ROACHES!! Went to eat a late dinner ended up throwing up my $22 Nachos after a cockroach crawled across the floor next to my foot! Bus boy stomped on it and just left it there next to my table on the floor. Was totally grossed out!!!! The waitress tried to explain why because of the indoor/outdoor setup but that really didn't help with the dead cockroach on the floor still!! Called the restaurant manager the next day and all he did was apologized,..... totally disappointed in how the whole situation was handled including the manager. Didn't even comp our meal or anything.....bad ending to my birthday weeke"}
{"text":"Went for some quick nachos and a margarita- Waited 15 minutes for someone to come to our table.  When the waitress arrived she dumped her jug of water on my wife, an instead of cleaning it up, she stood there for a minute with a \"embarrassed\" look on her face. We changed tables and told her \"not to worry about it\".  She didn't come back for along time so we left. Grabbed a margarita on the way out from the bar which sucked. There is way too many great casual Vegas restaurants to even bother giving them another shot."}
{"text":"Good food & great rock & roll music.   Fun place."}
{"text":"I've been to a few of their locations (including the original in Cabo) and I must say I like this one the best. We came here on a Wednesday night, so it wasn't as packed inside as it was outside on the balcony (facing the strip). The decor is awesome and the staff was great on this particular night. 

     Eric was our server, and he didn't waste anytime coming over to ask us what we would like for drinks. My friend and I ordered their bucket special which was any (5) Dos Equis or Heineken for $21. For food I ordered their delicious Baja style grilled fish (mahi-mahi) tacos. The fish tacos are not like the carne asada tacos as far as their size. The carne asada tacos are on a \"street taco\" sized tortilla while the fish tacos are on a regular sized tortilla. They are a mouth full and come with all the delicious fixings (cabbage, chipotle cream, and pico de gallo). Careful when you bite into them as they will drip onto the table, clothes, and eventually on the floor lol. I didn't notice it, until I was into my third and final taco. 

   Some of you might say we got great service because we came on a weekday when it was slow, but I've been to many places and got crappy service while not being busy. Besides, this is Las Vegas, there is never an off night."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican food we've ever had! Visiting from Texas. Food was amazing, flavorful, FRESH. You can not go wrong here."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was fast. Sitting out on the balcony is very loud so if you don't like loud I would sit inside. Otherwise this place is
Pretty cool!"}
{"text":"--- Review from www.JerseyGirlinVegas.com ---

Several months ago we came across a groupon for a restaurant on the strip in Planet Hollywood called Cabo Wabo. It's a Mexican/Cantina type of restaurant with some great dining options.

As we approached my birthday, my boyfriend asked where I wanted to have my birthday dinner. Without hesitation I said,\" Cabo Wabo!\"  Lucky for us, they have another Groupon going for $15 for $30 worth of food and drinks!

Last time we went we shared a 3-Choice Fajita. It's a bit pricy for $45 but it is well worth it! Both times we selected the sirloin, chicken and shrimp. Both times they were fantastic!! There is the perfect amount of food for two people where you leave full and satisfied. 

During our first visit I went with a margarita on the rocks which was soooo yummy!! This time we went with the buck of beer, 5/ $21. It was a bit frustrating when we walked in to the hostess and they have a little bar with a sign for $5 beers but when you go inside to dine, they bump those same beers up to $6-7 each. Not that it's much of a difference, it's more of the principal. I guess they try to get the tourist as they leave the resort with the $5 beer? 

Moral of this post: Eat at Cabo Wabo's but get your beer at their bar near the host area."}
{"text":"I cannot say this clearly enough, DO NOT GO! We wasted $86 on this place. Took over 20 minutes to just get our chips and salsa. Chicken Fajitas and Pork Carnitas were bland and tasteless. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas, I am a lightweight, I had almost 3 glasses and never felt a thing. My husband used to bartend and seriously doubted ANY tequila was in there, the overwhelming flavor was sweet and sour. No dissing the waitress as she attempted her best with no help from front door staff or bus staff. Yes it was a busy Saturday night but did they not expect that? C'mon already it's the strip! The only part that made us feel any better was the view of the Bellagio water show. Come sit at the bar overlooking it and have water!"}
{"text":"Great place to people watch!  The service just absolutely sucks.  Takes forever to get food and drink.  But if you can sit outside on the patio you can people watch and it's a great view.  Very cool."}
{"text":"I bought a groupon for this place because I figured I could just get some drinks with it. We got there and told the hostess we just wanted to drink so she pointed us in the direction of the outside bar...well there were no seats in the bar, so we wandered around and eventually sat ourselves at the inside bar. The BF and I got a couple of their 'signature' margaritas. They were pretty terrible. I had the prickly pear margarita and it was very strong and tasted fairly terrible. Also, they put some super spicy stuff around the rim of the cup that was really unpleasant and was not mentioned on the menu. The drinks were 12$. This was ridiculous. I would not come back here again."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick frozen margarita, which was okay, not too icy slush. They offer different flavors. Unfortunately I don't remember the names of the flavors but thinking about their bar all I can remember was blue, green , yellow, red, and black margaritas from the dispenser pump. 

I'm not too much of a margarita guy but hey they serve these at different hotels , it just so that those colors of margaritas are tempting for a nice cool inject of alky for the mood. 

Service here was good, the bartender was pleasant, sucked that typically they tell you for extra shots cost an extra few bucks (hook it up?) Overall for a quick margarita to go, this place is recommended if you happen to walk down Planet Hollywood for some re-charging."}
{"text":"Three stars for the great service.  The  waiter was awesome. He was on top of things and offered many options and specials. 
The food on the other hand wasn't that great. My beans were runny and I think there was one actual bean included in the watery bean stuff.  The rice was fluffy but not very tasty. My asada was dry but had some good flavors. 

The churros were pretty good. 
The facility was very clean but a little run down considering it is on the strip where everything is glamorous."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast and the food was AMAZING! So many options, very affordable and great service."}
{"text":"First time trying this place, been coming out here year after year and never took the time to come in, and that's a big mistake, definitely a must try, came in for breakfast, had chilaquiles and the quesadilla, both were BOMB ! And packed with flavor, will be returning here, also had very good service, nice host, and our server Amber was very helpful and made great recommendations. Thank You Guys !!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food.  We sat on the patio under the heated umbrellas and with the cool night air, laughed the night away.  We had the duo ceviche appetizer and LOVED IT!  The tuna was my favorite.  For dinner, I had the short rib tacos!  Phenomenal!  They are served like tapas (which the menu did not describe very well) on little corn tortillas.  So if you're really hungry you may want to add another appetizer. It was perfect for me since having just had the ceviche.  We highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Terrible service and way too loud music. Waited for refills way longer than I should have. Waitress wasn't polite. The good news is that I got a free drink when I checked in on yelp:)"}
{"text":"Ehhhh, I don't even know where to start. 

We were seated quickly on a Friday night which was great. The first thing I waiter did was pull an old waiter tip trick -- putting coaster under a \"wiggly\" table. The table wasn't even slightly off kilter. Whatever. I asked for water and Dr. Pepper to drink. He brought waters for everyone and 2 sodas and 2 beers. While we were looking over the menu we had questions. My mom and I don't eat beef or seafood, and their menu is very heavy with both of those things. We asked the waiter if we could switch the meat in the beef tacos to chicken. The answer was no. We asked if we could have chicken tacos in hard shells instead of soft corn. The answer was no. We finally settled on chicken taquitos which is technically an appetizer, but the only thing on the menu we MIGHT eat. It didn't come with anything so we both added beans and rice. My brother got some kind of beef taco in a soft corn tortilla and his friend got some kind of beef burrito. When they brought out the food, I had 4 taquitos on my plate, and my mom only had 3, so she asked, and they brought her another one. I ate exactly ONE taquito. The chicken inside was tough and bland. The rice was tasteless as were the beans. 

The waiter brought our check and it was $100 for four dinners, two of which weren't even eaten. We ended up boxing it up and giving it to a homeless man on the strip. 

Don't expect chips and salsa either. That's an extra $3.95, where I come from chips and salsa is always complimentary. 

Honestly, we had a hole in wall down the street that was SOOOO much better. 

Our waiter was rude, never once smiled, and seemed legitimately agitated. 

My brother and his friend liked it, so if you eat beef or shrimp, you might too, but if you are chicken eater like me and mom I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"We made a reservation on Open Table for this place. It was convenient. I found the seats quite uncomfortable. The food was okay. I had the chicken Sabana. I didn't love it, but it was interesting. The chips ans salsa were pretty good.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"don't get so excited - it's not the world's next Mexican food revelation. The location is prime, especially for those of us who love to people watch, and the staff is quick with a drink or pitcher refill. The food is good, though it doesn't blow me away - it is a chain, after all. The biggest draw to the CWC location is definitely just that - the location. Seating may get a bit tough if you come at a peak time, so be prepared to wait or walk elsewhere. I enjoyed the guac and the tacos, though the price didn't quite reflect the quality. If you're passing by and can catch a happy hour I would certainly recommend stopping by for an icy, salted beverage and some apps. Don't go out of your way though if you're looking for a place with some true authentic lip smacking mexican - Vegas has lots of it, but this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Below average service, decent food. THE WAITRESS ADDED AN EXTRA $10.50 to her tip! This is the biggest let down. If the service was decent a 20-25% tip is a nice thank you but when the service is poor close to an 18% tip is generous when there was very little interaction. My wife and I had a $51.96 check, tip rounded the amount to $60 and the charge to our card posted $70.50! The tip was for the service, the food was only decent and so how the waitress earned a 35% tip is outrageous! Apparently she didn't realize I don't drink and rounding the check is an easy way for me to keep track of the amounts. I will be placing a call to speak to the management as well. We satay the table next to the bar and the kitchen. This was on 6/17/2017 during lunch. It posted to my account as a service on 6/18/2017 which is Sunday Father's Day and we were on our 
----------------------UPDATED----------------------After speaking to the Manager Jason I feel the service has been rectified. When management is proactive in acknowledging poor service it speaks volumes for any company or restaurant. Now to clarify my review of the food being decent, the carne asada tacos were enjoyed by all as well as the queso dip. My son-in-law really enjoyed the BBQ wings, and for me they had a little too much BBQ sauce, but for BBQ lovers you'll obviously enjoy them. The taquitos where the also split, my daughter really liked them, but she was the only one. So that would have to be the weakest item. Overall food was enjoyable at a fair price. After speaking with management I know we will return.

{"text":"The margaritas (on the rocks) are excellent! Their coconut margarita is fabulous! The atmosphere is great and they play good (classic rock) music. The food is just okay but then again, I'm not a fan of Tex-mex anyway! If you are looking for a place to relax with friends and have a few tasty margaritas, this is the place to come! Oh, as far as the service, I only delt With the bartenders and they were fine."}
{"text":"Got the basic breakfast burrito..loved it. Perfect size and very reasonably priced. I will definitely revisit this place in the future... maybe tonight. The only reason didn't give 5 stars is that there was a small amount of construction going on inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast, it was really good!!! I had chilaquiles and my wife had a veggie omelet, it was great!!! The waitress was awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"I was expecting a much better experience from Cabo Wabo, but it was just OK. 

The food was the worst part of it. I thought it was meh, and my girlfriend didn't even finish her food. 

I had the Carne Asada Burrito served Enchilada Style. I was not a fan of the flavors. 

My girlfriend had the Chicken Enchiladas. She was not OK with them at all. There was so much Cilantro in the sauce and even more cilantro mixed in with the chicken it was extremely over powering. 

But what saved a 1 star rating was the service and the drinks. The drinks were awesome.
I had the key lime martini because I love key lime pie. Its really tasty. It is rimmed with graham cracker crumbs and it tastes like a kicked up key lime pie. 
She had a Margarita which she really liked. 

Overall I guess I just had a meh experience because of the food. I would probably give it another try, but try different food."}
{"text":"I will start out by saying that the food was good. Not great but it was above average. We had the shrimp ceviche and chicken fajitas. The ceviche was on point and we loved it. The chicken in the fajitas was very dry but still the fajitas were tasty enough. 

The day we went, the place was maybe 1/3 full. We were seated after waiting 4-5 minutes while the hostess made small talk with some ladies who weren't sure if they wanted to eat there. Meanwhile another hostess/employee stared into the abyss twirling her hair.  Once we were seated, we were told that our server would be with us soon. After 10-15 minutes of no server, we got up and sat at the bar because we were really hungry.  The bartender was very friendly but clearly new. She took our order and after a half hour, the food had not arrived. After about 35-40 minutes, the food arrived. Again, the place was in no way busy.  As we left, we saw a couple sitting at what was originally our table and I overheard them telling a waiter which they flagged down that they had been waiting for 15 minutes and not seen a server."}

{"text":"Good service & cold beer. I would recommend drinking here and eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Mexican I have ever been to. The food amazing, chips and Queso with beef steak added to die for!
Also we had steak fajitas GREAT
Eat here and you won't be disappointed .
Great atmosphere with a little rustic charm added.
Great service from Kate, thank you. we will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent location off of the strip! Must sit on the patio! Faces the strip, outstanding atmosphere! Live music, GREAT food! Outstanding ribs, sweet and spicy chicken wings and best of all...the MARGARITAS!! The entrance is in he Miracle Mall! GREAT Mall by the way!"}
{"text":"As a tourist in Vegas, this is a very touristy spot to visit while on the strip. Located in planet hollywood, you can't miss the restaurant right in front. We came for lunch and sat inside. The outside was more packed than the inside, but the Vegas dry heat is not our friend. The inside is extremely spacious with plenty of tables, and a photographer came by to take our picture as a souvenir while we waited for our food. They end up giving you the picture printed for free, plus 20% off discount on your next visit! The servers and hostess were accommodating and they never left us alone for more than 5 minutes. I might be exaggerating a little, but it seemed that way. Now the tacos, they were too spicy for my taste. I should have ordered what my boyfriend got, but I don't like ordering the same dish twice. I could barely finish them since the spice was too heavy, but if they weren't too spicy, I would have definitely finished every last bite. It's a memorable place because we have a picture souvenir, but definitely not somewhere where we'd go again. Even if we lived in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love this place. Good food, good music, AWESOME service from Betsy. I hate Vegas but I love this place"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the food!  It is not authentic Mexican food, which they don't necessarily advertise authentic Mexican food, but the salsa alone was disgusting, so I didn't touch my chips and salsa.  Their rice is gross as it tastes like paper.  Their beans tasted like can.  The chicken enchiladas were edible though, I did eat those.  The frozen strawberry was super yummy!  I think it bearly had alcohol though."}
{"text":"What are these people complaining about?  Didn't they arrive blasted drunk?  This place was great!  Sure the hot female staff in daisy dukes advertised turned out to be a prissy dude in jeans, but that wasn't too bad since the female waitresses tended to have a muffin top.  The drinks weren't good and overpriced, but with a few good drinks and several okay ones before you get here, who cares?  I ordered the mahi mahi. It's all right that it arrived rubbery and tough, because I just sent it back and got the short ribs with spit tacos instead. Given enough alcohol, the blandly seasoned meat won't matter as you revel in the extra grease that was such an integral part of the dish. If you're planning on being blind drunk in the area and are looking for a place with a bathroom, this is an easy half star better than peeing in the street!"}
{"text":"This is my first and last experience here. The service was slow to begin with but when the waitress came it was fine. I had a dinner salad that had so much vinaigrette it was inedible.  The short rib enchiladas was ok, the meat was good but the tortillas were so tough a knife wouldn't cut it.  Thank goodness I played the slots and this meal was paid by the winnings.  I guess it was better then losing the 40. at the slots.  But I may have more fun playing the slots then I had eating the food.  Once was more then enough."}
{"text":"We wanted to visit this restaurant because Sammy's \"Cabo Wabo\" tequila was a sponsor for a stunt plane we loved seeing at the airshows and we are loyal to folks who sponsor the sport we love. So while we were at CinemaCon this year we stopped in for dinner. We were very disappointed. I would have given it 3 stars for food. 1 star for service. To start with it was not busy, We were seated under a heat lamp on a rather warm night and had to move, I felt like I was getting a sun burn. Unfortunately no one came to check on us for some time. We almost walked out but right then we found a table not under a heat lamp and the bus boy helped us move to that table. Finally we met our waitress, she was very rude right off the bat. \"what do you want to drink?\", I told her I was hoping to see a drink menu. I was informed they were out. \"If you come back next week you can see one.\" Yes she really said that. WOW! So I just got a boring margarita. Turns out it tasted like almost every other margarita I ever had. I had been feeling festive and wanted to try something new but oh well.  At this point we changed our plans and decided just to have our first drink and finish our dinner and find someplace else to have a few fun drinks and desert. Too bad because we had permission to use the company credit card for a night out. Cabo Wabo could have made more than a few bucks off of us sucker tourists. Haha. Well, When the waitress would condescend to stop by, she never once smiled. Made me feel like we were bothering her by coming in. Food was pretty good. I was just shocked at the attitude of the waitstaff we encountered. Also on a side note, I slipped on spilled ice when going to the restroom (womans restroom was a mess). The employees did not even help me up, a couple customers did. Luckily I was not hurt just turns out high heels and ice dont mix well, but the girl working inside, who was about 20 feet away when I fell,  could have asked me if I was okay nor did anyone seem concerned there was ice on the floor.

If I had to sum up our visit in one word: BUMMER"}
{"text":"The chips were okay, queso was not tasty definitely one of the worse. I ordered the carne asada tacos...definitely over cooked, the rice seems like it came out of a rice-a-roni box if I am being truthful. It definitely had a chain feel and not a good chain. The atmosphere was okay except sitting outside and a breeze hits...reminds me of the hot stagnant smells of New Orleans streets the morning after a mardi gras parade (warm regurgitated alcohol and urine)....take caution in dining and don't expect great food and you won't be disappointed....ps the service was great, very attentive waitress..."}
{"text":"Epic. These guy BROUGHT US A TABLE. We just sat in the middle of nowhere on some chairs and they BROUGHT THE TABLE.  Quality. The margs are great too."}
{"text":"Spent an early evening there last night. Great bar staff x3 and one man band. Live music was awesomely entertaining which went with the personal touch of the staff and tequila!"}
{"text":"I don't really know why this place has so many poor reviews.  My friends and I ate lunch here and we thought the food, drinks and the service were all pretty good.  I'd definitely eat here again if staying near the city center area on the strip."}
{"text":"We got our breakfast to go and I wish we had stayed to really enjoy the meal. I had the CW Skillet and my husband had the Huevos Rancheros, and both were AWESOME. The CW potatoes are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside ... some of the most \"home fries\"-style potatoes I've ever had. My scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked and my husband said his Huevos were the best he's ever had (and this dish is a go-to for him). Would have loved to stay and enjoy a morning bevvie with my food, but I was also very happy to learn they did take-out orders so I could get my hangover back to bed"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to review this place. If it's for atmosphere I'd give it 5 stars. People watching on the strip was a blast. We sat at the counter seating overlooking the Bellagio fountain show. It was awesome! Our hosts and server were also excellent! However, I had to knock it down to 3 stars for the food. My boyfriend and I both disliked our meals. I am a mexican food lover so I just couldn't be happy with the food here. I would definitely come back just for drinks and thr view though!"}
{"text":"YUM! Came here twice during our stay in Vegas. Service is great! Food is even greater! Highly recommend the ribs (yumm) and the pi√±a colada as a drink :)"}
{"text":"Yummy fajitas, but not so yummy Sunday night karaoke.

Skip it and sit outside if you can.  The entertainment is much better!"}
{"text":"Who went there a couple days ago we had Ryan for our server
He did a really good job friendly explain all the plates .
Great recommendation for dessert.
The sound it wasn't that good that's why it taking a start.
It seems like it was a live band but we do not see it there was some video music from the 80's old school but Mary had to listen to that music in general it's a pretty good place for tourists I want to the blue moon for us."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food, drinks and atmosphere of this restaurant.  My husband LOVES their spicy steak (makes him cry every time) and I love their shrimp tacos (so light and delicious)!  Their margarita's are very yummy, my favorite is the one with coconut and honey on the rim.  Great place to eat!  Also, I love how the waitresses dress!"}
{"text":"Located right on the strip. Horrible mixed drinks and expensive food. The service was not good. Our server was wearing a hoodie and called me \"bro\" ....i am not a bro."}
{"text":"I am a texmex junkie! I could eat it everyday. Cabo Wabo was a pretty good experience and here is why : 

1. The nachos were very good. Also the chips and dips were good also.
2. I ordered the beef tacos with rice. My food was good and large in portion size. Not the best I've had but okay.
3. Our waitress was cranky at first but warmed up. 

Would go there for happy hour"}
{"text":"Service was fabulous here, our server was super friendly and attentive. The food was delicious and our group of 11 was happy with where we landed, especially after the poor experience we had at the first restaurant we tried that night. o.O The food was delicious and the place was PACKED. In reality it is in a great spot so of course there is going to be a lot of foot traffic. They made room for our large group and were very accommodating, our starving group was appreciative!"}
{"text":"straight to the bar....order the 'flight of tequilas'. that's how my visits start! great drinks. great food. great music. great vibe. great service. gets crowded, so keep that in mind when planning your visit. the fajitas are to die for!"}
{"text":"Loved the food....drinks were advertised as  hearty & were weak as allllll get out.  And, they added a 5%  franchise fee  to the bill.  Seriously a 4-5 star until that.  Asked the wait person, who got defensive (want a manager to explain it to you?).  Always, great food held back by cheesy pass on of 5% franchise fee to the patrons.  Recommend you drink elsewhere.  Food very yummy."}
{"text":"A nice place to rest your feet after walking the strip and have a nice refreshing drink. I came down to vegas for my best friend's wedding and me and my friend decided to do the tourist thing and walk the strip. We decided to head there since the live band called to just. Friendly bartenders and we got to meet a nice older couple. Defenite recommendation"}
{"text":"The inside of the place looked like a glorified Taco Bell, I was really disappointed with the layout and feel of the place since it is a celeb owned restaurant. The nachos were terrible and made my husband sick, but I got the Carne asada tacos and they were really good and I was fine later. We also had tons of food we wouldn't normally eat and drank a lot more than usual. (I think it finally caught up with him and made his stomach hurt) I ordered guacamole and chips as a side and it was SO good. I wasn't able to eat even half  of it, but I wish we had one close by just so I could get the guacamole."}
{"text":"The empty bar should have been the first clue to the mediocrity that is Cabo Wabo.

The food was ehhh (\"tostada\" was more a pile of oversauced food on a nacho)... The service was ehhh... The music was slightly too loud... And the karaoke (which consisted of two creepy, old male singers and no crowd) was pretty awful.  Quite saddening."}
{"text":"I only can here to drink  had a pitcher of margarita it was pretty good I could definitely taste the alcohol in it can't tell you what the food was like but it was pretty packed so it must have been decent"}
{"text":"We stopped in before a concert. The food was okay. It felt like they squeezed us in at our table. Waiters kept walking into us and the table. The food took quite some time to come out. We didn't get everything so we had to keep asking. The food tasted good. The whole experience wasn't great so it lowered the experience. The four stars is for the food. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"This is a really great beer stop on the strip. Specials on buckets of beer and chill spot to hang with friends. Great view of the strip and the Bellagio fountain. The only down side is service is kinda slow and you might have to hunt them down."}
{"text":"This is a place I've been wanting to hit for a while. NYE was super crowded but was able to return for my birthday trip. Dining in for a quick snack on a weekday, the vibe at this place was awesome, they had a cover band (which I didn't catch their name) covered a mix of alt music and rock, it was absolutely chill as if it were a Sunday afternoon. The nacho platter was delicious, cheese blend covered perfectly and had the right amount of sour cream and guac. The weather was perfect. I high recommend this place to sit back enjoy great food with great company. The staff was so attentive and great, came in with beer from the casino and offered to refill, they all were on point. Wait time was zero and fit us in super quick. Definite repeat customer here. Great job. Can't wait to return for UFC on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Had the dos ceviches, the shrimp was almost as good as mine.  The tuna was a little oily, but the flavor was good.  Drink prices are good and my margarita was good.  Atmosphere was busy and loud, but fun!"}
{"text":"Of all the places we are at during our recent trip to Las Vegas, our random stop into Cabo Wabo Cantina was our favorite of the trip

The atmosphere, we sat outside was top notch. The view was excellent and service was very prompt and attentive. 

We had the Cabo wabo margarita and now jealous we can't have one back home. Best drink we had during our stay! 

We shared fajitas and we chose the chicken and carnitas mix. That didn't let us down either. We saw the next table over had the Mexican corn and we are now food jealous. 

We were expecting the price to be outrageous because of location along and again we were surprised. 

We will definitely go back when in town."}
{"text":"My experience at Cabo Wabo was Awesome!!! 

The hostess was friendly, the location and view was perfect (right on the strip),  the food was delicious (FYI... I had the shrimp enchiladas) and my waiter Danny M. was INCREDIBLE! He knew the menu like the back of his hand and was friendly and engaging. Definitely recommend! Ask for Danny M!"}
{"text":"Went to Cabo Wabo because we were in town for a bachelor party and one of the groomsmen was feeling a need for some mojitos. I was skeptical at first because I figured these guys focus their efforts hocking 3' tall slushy drinks on the miracle mile. I was wrong.
We sat at the bar and ordered a round of mojitos. Before I knew it we were 2 mojitos down and the bartenders started pouring shots of fireball on the house while grilling us on our favorite nfl teams. It was basically nfl trivia; get a question right, get a shot, get a question wrong, get shot with a water pistol (I got shot a lot). We laughed with these guys for a solid hour while drinking some of the best mojitos I've ever had and laughing about sports.
If you get the chance to sit down at Cabo Wabo I highly recommend sitting at the bar because these guys know how to have a good time."}
{"text":"We came here about 2 years ago. I'm mostly to blame. Being a Van Halen fan I wanted to eat at Sammy hagar's place....not a bad place to eat at all. In fact we had fun at our seats which overlooked the strip and had a view of the ballagio's fountains. But the food was just \"ok\" I had a burrito (I've had better) and my girlfriend had the street tacos....maybe we're California Mexican food snobs, but this was definitely some white washed Mexican food. Still edible but I guess go for the experience."}
{"text":"This place was horrible! Went in for dinner, place was about half full, if that... Should have been a warning sign... Took more than 20 minutes to get a drink order in. Over 30 minutes to get some chips. Chips came, and the server had dropped off a load of beer for another table at the same time as getting out chips. He had manages to get the run off from the beer all over the chips. Didn't notice it till we were like wonder why the wet!?! Gross! Food came about 45 minutes later, it was nasty... Dry, flavor-less, and my stomach was all messed up after this place. Wonder why... 

Save your money, don't go here. Everything from the food to the service is a joke..."}
{"text":"Go here for a Rita and watch the Bellagio fountain.

Even it's a bit cool you can sit on the patio above the sidewalk and enjoy the view and do some people watching and stay warm with the patio heaters.

You will find the food and service is average at best. 

A Cabo Wabo Anejo rita will set you back $14 and served in a plastic cup."}
{"text":"Stopped in to cool off... Nachos are awesome.  We wanted to compare it (restaurant) to the cabo wabo in cabo, Mexico.  Totally different but good none the less.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We stayed in Vegas for 4 days and came here 4 times. It was hands down my favourite casual dining spot on the strip. The happy hour menu is best as it is half price apps and margaritas. Also good for brunch and also good for drinks. The patio is the best. Great atmosphere and live music at night and it was an incredibly reasonable price. This place felt like a home base restaurant while we were in Vegas. 
Food was great for the price and the atmosphere can't be beat, right in the middle of the action.
The wait staff is ok. They are inconsistent And one waitress was great and another was slow etc. It did take a long time for the food to come but ...hey, we were on vacation and had nothing better to do but sip our drinks. Loved this place. Bottom line... Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Are you looking for the best sugar water in town you found it!!!! Better go to Fat Tuesdays!!!! Better deal!!!. I got the 18 dollar drink wit supposedly 4 1/2 shots it tasted nothing but like sugar water I will not recommend this to anyone avoid this place at all cost! I even asked if she put the extra shot she said yea but you will taste it!! Nope I didn't"}
{"text":"The beef and chicken tacos are excellent. Make sure you check in and you will get a free margarita!!"}
