{"text":"Calgary is a city with dozens of Pho places, and Pho Hoai remains my favourite. The broth is so rich and beefy in a way that others aren't. The salad rolls and other accompaniments are good too, but the real star is the pho."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy. It is hands-down my absolute favourite Pho restaurant.
The portions are huge and the basil is always super fresh.
I always order the # 15 Pho Sate with Rare Beef. It's the best I've found in the city and very reasonably priced.
The ladies there are sweet and they serve free Jasmin Tea. Yay!
Only wish they also served Taro bubble tea."}
{"text":"Cute booths, generous portions. I ate the salad rolls and the #2 (noodle soup with rare beef, chewy but not bloody). Comfort food. Neat service."}
{"text":"I've come here since I was a 14 so I'm quite familiar with this place.  They've since renovated this place which is nice but the open kitchen still bothers me.  The smell of pho is so overwhelming that you'll smell of pho all the way back.  

The food comes out fast and furious and if you want to come at lunch, you better get there by 11:30 or else, good luck finding a spot.  I could live with the poor service at times because the food makes up for it.  The Pho Sate is excellent although, no longer my favorite.  I've tried other items but it's the Sate that keeps me coming back for more.  

This is a place where you want to go get a quick bite during lunch.   Eat and get the hell out because the longer you stay, the harder it is to get that smell off your clothes.  I don't go here as often any more since I no longer work in downtown.  It's just not worth the hassle to find parking around Chinatown just to have a bowl of Sate when I could go somewhere else.  Relocate to a place with free parking and plenty of seats and I'll give this joint one extra star.  Put in a huge furnace fan with a turbo engine and close off the kitchen so that no air can escape to the dinning area and I'll definitely give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place has not much going for decor, but you can't beat the food. One of the few places in town that makes bun bo hue, and it's fantastic. I hear great things about pho, but can't wean myself from the spicy, orange wonder of bun bo hue. I've had their noodle bowls, and they're okay, not my favorite in town, that award goes to Viet West on Centre St."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the Far East Shopping Center, you'll find Pho Hoai. 

I opted for the beef sate which came with a substantial amount of noodles, topped with thinly sliced rare beef, onions in a spicy broth that carried a hint of curry.

For $10, you get an authentic Vietnamese pho which I think can be hard to come by in downtown Calgary these days."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Pho places in Calgary.  In addition to the restaurant being relatively clean and the food being fresh (particularly the vegetables that one adds to the noodles), I really love the broth.  It has a clean taste that doesn't dominate the noodles, but adds the perfect balance of flavour.  My favourite dish is the Pho Sate which, while spicy and may make you sweat, does not feel like napalm on your tongue.  Also, the salad rolls taste fresher than most places.  It isn't cheap as far as Pho is concerned (large Pho Sate is $9.25).  However, when I seek a quality bowl of Pho I find myself often coming here."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. I actually don't eat the Pho Thai noodles anymore, I order # 22 which is a beef dish served on a bed of lettuce with a bowl of rice on the side. A large one of these costs about $13.00  I usually get my two little guys some rice and spring rolls. That's all they really want."}
{"text":"I ordered well done pho and it was bland and lacked spices. But maybe I just dont have good taste haha. It was 11$ for a huge bowl I could have eaten over 2 days. The place is not really clean but spacious and cozy"}
{"text":"Favorite for downtown pho- sate pho is awesome. Impersonal staff most days, good pho every time."}
{"text":"My favourite Pho shop in all of Calgary. Hard to find--it's tucked in the mall, off the street. I'd highly recommend the spicy beef pho, they have it mastered; the right amount of spice and flavour, perfect for a cool day, or whenever you're craving pho really."}
{"text":"Today was a bit chilly when it almost hit lunch time so my co-workers and I decided we needed a big bowl of hot soup that can warm our souls. What better way to satisfy that quench for heat then a big bowl of Pho!

We made our way over to Pho Hoai and as I haven't been there before I definitely made sure I was coming today as I've missed out on other days going there. Pho Hoai is situated inside a strip mall in Chinatown. You can sit inside the restaurant and they have a few tables outside the restaurant as well. 

I would recommend coming here like any other place downtown around 11:30AM - 11:45AM. If you plan coming after 11:45AM (like we did) you should expect to be waiting anywhere from 10-20 minutes for a table depending on who sat first and how long it takes them to finish their meals.

What I really like about this place is their efficiency, there are quite a few people working here on the lunch hour and as soon as people stand up to leave, they have busers coming to take away the dishes and wipe down the table ready for the next occupants.

If you read my Pho reviews you know I only and always get the Pho Tai Bo Vien whether it is on the menu or not (usually it will either list Pho Tai OR Pho Bo Vien but not both as a combination).

Boy, was I ever delighted to dip my soup spoon in that broth and have a taste because it was delicious. It's the kind of broth that has the perfect balance of color and taste, where one does not overwhelm the other and you can enjoy the broth right to the bottom of the bowl.

Pho Hoai being so close to work (3-4 block walk) I will be definitely coming here more often (earlier of course) for my Pho, pho sure. Get it? Toodles."}
{"text":"Whole in a wall but the food is tasty and relatively cheap. Don't expect 5* service but you will leave satisfied"}
{"text":"Writing this while recovering between throwing up for the past half hour. Food poisoning, enough said. Try at your own risk.."}
{"text":"Never coming back to this place.  For pho, it's expensive.   For those you think they have good prices, you have to try other pho restaurants.  Soup is just so so.  Horrible horrible service.  We were there at 11:45, so it was not busy yet.  Nobody seated us so we seated ourselves.  Talked to at least 3 waitresses to finally get some tea.  I wanted to order, but every waitress that passes by keeps saying another waitress is coming.. Huh??? What are they there for then? Why can't they just take my order?
The owner finally came out, I thought I was finally going to get some service, then he tells me we are sitting on the wrong table because the two seater table was suppose to be combined with more tables.  Well, if they had seated us when we first came in, we won't be sitting there.  I didn't mind moving, it was his commanding voice that was very rude.  One of the worst service restaurants with unjustifiable food quality."}
{"text":"We love this place. We come from Edmonton to visit family and always HAVE to atop in for soup."}
{"text":"The Pho broth here is rich and delicious. It is also the only place in Calgary that has clear noodles. Your food comes quick and steaming hot (perfect for me!) and the sauces are very addictive. 

The service is definitely lacking and needs a lot of improvement. But I guess you don't go to a Pho restaurant for the service!"}
{"text":"I like this place for sate beef pho and spring rolls. I like the owner - an older gentleman who's really nice. The staff are quick to get you a menu and the food comes out fast and hot. Prices are inexpensive, the portions are large (if you get a large pho). I like the broth which is flavourful and spicy and hot enough to cook the sprouts. Generous amounts of sprouts and basil, which you can get cooked if you're worried about getting e-coli. One of the best deals in Chinatown and one of the better Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"If you are offended by the distinct smells of a shopping centre in China town then you may want to skip this place.  If you can get by that and hold your breath until you make it into the restaurant, you'll be happy you did.  
My favourite Vietnamese soup isn't on the menu here which is Bun Cari Ga, so I had the fairly standard Sate rare beef pho.  Quick service and reasonably priced. It was pretty good, spicy and flavorful but not overbearing.  A few too many noodles for me but lots of beef as well.  It comes in three sizes and I think you'd have to be pretty hungry to finish the XL bowl.  
Not sure what else to say about Pho?  It was good.  I'll go back.
If it's good enough Pho me it's good enough Pho you..."}
{"text":"Me and my companion ordered the number 6 small and large. The meat was definitely okay but nothing amazing. Tried the number 11 and it was vastly Superior. Why didn't the manager take my crappy number 6 and replace it with an 11?  next rime he said.  der wih be roh rext rime.  forget it."}
{"text":"The best pho downtown if you can get a seat!

Easily my favorite pho restaurant downtown that also has some good vermicelli dishes. The only issue is that a lot of people downtown feel this way. You will need to be there before noon if you want to be sure to be out of there before one. I also enjoy their salad rolls which are pretty typical. There are three sizes (S, L, XL). I usually eat a large and then remember I only really needed a small so I would recommend starting with that size unless you're really hungry (or plan on taking some home). Service isn't great as they have a small staff with a lot of patrons and the owner/manager doesn't place any emphasis on courtesy but he doesn't need to due to the quantity of patrons.

See you there at lunch (although I think they're open at other times)."}
{"text":"Looking for some good Pho in Calgary, we stumbled across Pho Hoai while roaming around Chinatown.  We both ordered a large bowl (one was rare meat while the other was well done).  The beef was very fresh, the noodles were done perfectly, and the broth was very good once it was flavored with my favorite basil, lime, and siracha.  Service was good, prices were a bit more the California (where we are from), and the ambiance was average (but fine).  Give this place a try...so many eateries to choose from in the area, but this one is definitely a strong bet!"}
{"text":"Okay the ambiance leaves a lot to be desired but the food... the food is bang on. Inside of a mall, this little gem has the most delicious soup I've ever had. Their portion sizes are out of control. The small was more than enough the large could have fed a family of 4. The pricing can't be beat. The service was fast and efficient. 

Really the only reason I'm taking a star off is the whole mall thing and the bathroom situation is weird (it's down the hall and you need a key but the only key they have is for the men's room which left me holding it for about an hour as we walked around downtown. TMI??). 

If you're looking for great pho without any bells or whistle or just a cheap filling lunch, this is your jam."}
{"text":"Probably my top 5 Viet Pho places. Portions are good (not like most places now, stingy with noodles), the soup base is very tasty, doesn't give you that super-thirsty-after-all-the-msg kind of soup.
The rare beef pho here is good, so is the rare beef satay noodle!"}
{"text":"I find the beef satay soup to be absolutely outstanding. So much so that I rarely order soup and any other restaurant because I know I'm just going to be disappointed. The ice coffee is exceptional as well and if you like fresh spring rolls they are very tasty. I usually order the large soup which is filling without being overwhelming. If you have an exceptionally large appetite then you may try the extra large."}
{"text":"I had a craving for pho on a stormy chilly day in August and a web search brought me here. It's in a small Asian mall across the hall from a meat counter which had a strong foul odor that spilled into the restaurant. After a while (and with the smell of food) the foul meat odor waned. I've had a ton of pho all over North America and this was comparable: fresh vegetables and good quality meat. The broth was unique - light, not heavy as others and not as rich and cloudy. Consequently, the meat had noticeably flavored the broth. We also had a side of fresh spring rolls: pretty tasty, nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Best sate beef pho i have ever had! I can't even explain how good it is! If your ever in china town or just looking for some good Vietnamese food come here!"}
{"text":"Friend recommended me to come here for lunch. She said its the best Pho Noodle in Calgary Downtown. So I have to try and see if she is right about it. I have to say the pho base is very clear and tasty. Tasty as in I can't taste any MSG and or maybe there are none (not a pro to know). But afterward I am not thirsty. I got number 3 which is rare beef with beef flank pho. They are very generous in the meat. That is a plus. 

The place is super busy especially at 11:30. Everyone is trying to beat the rush and they all fail. That is when the rush starts. OK, I came at noon and was able to get a seat but still have to wait for someone to clean the table. When we sat down the spoon was dirty and so I sent that back. Also the glass of water had lipstick mark left by left customer and yes I sent that back too. 

Food wise its good. 

Its located in the Far East Mall. Inside near the back of the mall. They are so busy that they even took part of the outside of the restaurant. Yes they have tables and chairs out there too. WOW. that is how busy they are. I mean with that many people, it must be good.

I highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Best Pho in Calgary. No contest. When you walk in, before the manager rushes you to your seat (they move fast!) take a moment to pause and look in the kitchen. What you will see is some very hard working ladies standing next to massive pots of boiling soup filled with pork bones. An assembly line of flavour and flurry as they toss the various combinations on ingredients to make your pho or bun to order.

This piping hot liquid will soon be dumped into amazing fresh flavours, they will toss in raw beef and run it to your table. Just perfect. A few blocks from the main downtown Calgary I go here once a week and always bump into coworkers."}
{"text":"The food was fine but the takeout packaging was terrible. After I picked it up, I drove out to get gas and then headed home. I realized that something was leaking so I pulled over. The way the takeout bag was assembled was just horrible. The soup broth was balancing on one side with the vermicelli bowl crooked on top, when I reached in to rearrange things half the vermicelli spilled out. The bag was already full of broth and I ended up getting soup everywhere. To add to my frustration, I was in a rental car so had to make sure not to get anything anywhere which was next to impossible. Buy the time I got home the two dishes were basically just two giant messes and half the broth was missing. And to top it off the food was just okay - nothing I would go through that hassle again for. 

If you pickup make sure they arrange the bag properly before you leave."}
{"text":"This place is very busy on sundays... And I know why.. I think the Vietnamese food here is really good. Even when it is not a fancy place, I think the food is delicious!!.. I will definitely go back there!!.."}
{"text":"Rude and over priced!  The food is OK but you get just as good around the corner at Pho Pasteur.  

The guy in charge on weekday lunch always has a frown like he doesn't want to be there.  He even yelled at a coworker of mine for taking too long to decide on the menu choices."}
{"text":"One of the most unassuming, delicious pho spots I've ever been to. Located in a tiny strip mall, this spot is unassuming but brilliant. 

I was visiting my parents for the holidays and we decided a bowl of pho would be a perfect part of our chilly Christmas Eve. 

The broth: excellent. Could drink it from a teacup every morning. I've had plenty of pho, and this broth tops all the others. 

The noodles: perfect cook, the ideal amount. 

Service: friendly, quick and unobtrusive. Let me slurp my noodles in peace. Thank you!

Price: reasonable, a well-worth-it meal

Every time I visit from CA I will swing by my new favorite Canadian pho spot."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We got the pho and bun Bo hue. The pho broth I felt lacked some depth, it was a bit bland, but the bun Bo hue was very delicious. Flavourful, spicy and delicious!  The salad rolls were excellent as well. I probably sat at the most popular seat in the restaurant as it was patched up with duct tape. Alas, I'm here for the food, not really for the ambiance as in most Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"I ordered the #36 veggie spring rolls vermicelli. I must say it was pretty good but in all honesty I fairly enjoy Vietnamese food as long as it's made by Vietnamese people. I would say though that the food was pretty average and I have had better but nonetheless I was satisfied. I give an extra star for the hardworking older gentleman that was our server. His work ethic (the place was completely dead and he was still tending to us and tidying up) and his smile just melted my heart. Good place!"}
