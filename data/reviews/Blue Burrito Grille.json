{"text":"Pros: 1. Hot salsa was pretty good             2. When I called to complain about my burrito being wrong they did offer me a                             free burrito.  Cons: 1. Burrito was super small. I like a burrito that is the size of a small child and puts you into an immediate food coma. This was not that place. The only thing hefty about these burritos was the price. $7 for a burrito and I expect a loooooooot more.   2. The food was cold.   3. I paid for guacamole and opened up my burrito and there was a little guacamole smeared on, but not much.   4. They got my order wrong. I wanted rice in my burrito and they left it out.   Ok, so I have high expectations. But I am super loyal once a place makes me an outstanding burrito. So, for now Blue Burrito I'm not smitten, but I will give you one more chance. If you impress me an update will follow."}
{"text":"3 stars is accurate, love this place but not amazing. I would say go there if youre around, but dont go out of your way."}
{"text":"Serving cold food on styrofoam plates= class. The service was horrible, with the waitress saying they had 'ground beef' and came out with steak, saying 'Thats what we have'. Also, got food poisoning. Stat away!"}
{"text":"A fairly new addition to Scottsdale Fashion Square, Blue Burrito has seemed to have reinvented itself before. Whereas before, you could order items like salads, enchiladas and tacos off the menu, BBG now has a Chipotle-like setup that lets you pick burrito, bowl, salad or tacos and choose your ingredients. Much better than what they had before because before they had a tendency to mess up my order.   If you're lucky, the salsa will be good on the day you visit. Some times it's watery and upsetting. Other times, it's thick and flavorful.  I'm told the rice & beans and both vegetarian, unlike many local Mexican joints, so that's a big plus. You can add things like corn, cabbage, peppers and guacamole to your item of choice if you like, too. Although, the guac could be kicked up a notch w/ some cilantro and lime juice.  In the future, I'd like to see a vegetarian \"meat\" option but I'm not going to hold my breath. It's easy for a place like BBG to add grilled eggplant, or tofu, or strips of grilled portabello mushroom or mock meat at very little cost to the business. The additional costs could be passed on to the consumer, in so gaining the heart of the vegetarian community, expanding their customer base, and giving vegetarians a heartier, more satisfying burrito.  And I think that about wraps it up."}
{"text":"Blue Burrito Grille is a clean, friendly little place near gate C5. I ordered the Green Chili Carnitas burrito, and was pleasantly surprised at the speed at which the food came out, but also at the quality. The tortilla was warm, but not the same temp as the fillings, which made me realize it wasn't microwaved, but properly warmed. The carnitas was moist, flavorful and tasty. Definitely a good place for a pre boarding snack."}
{"text":"Wowza!! Rock bottom honors. Worst in the universe, I'd rather eat dirt on Mars. One would have to be quite mentally and physically incapacitated to conjure this taco. Bitter black soft-shell, rendered un-ending by loads of cabbage like hay to masticate. Uncooked and unseasoned, hard black beans are paired with beef rendered lifeless as if washed in a laundry and beaten to pulp. Fly away, refuse to pay, someone say something this is an assault to all human sensibilities!!!"}
{"text":"Blue Burrito is very similar to Baja Fresh, but healthier.  I'd recommend the shrimp burrito.  You order at a counter and get your food when they call your number.  My only complaint is that for the price, you should get a side besides the chips and salsa bar.  Also, love the stamp card option."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING ALERT!!  Do NOT eat at Blue Burrito in Terminal 3 of PHX.  On March 15, 2013, I was really contemplating between Blue Burrito and the Wendy's at T3.  Not many choices behind security, and had had enough fast food that week.  Decided on Blue Burrito with hesitation as I have had poor quality food there once in the past.  Bad move!  I ended up ordering the Blue Corn Chicken Tacos.  As one reviewer noted, the corn taco shells were awful - tough, stale and tasteless.  The worst offense though was the chicken.  As I ate the generically spiced chicken, I noticed that it seemed a bit watery and slightly off in color.  I should have stopped there.  Instead, I finished my meal and got on board my flight to Atlanta.  Within minutes of getting on board, I begin to feel nauseous with a pounding headache and upset stomach.  Somehow I held back getting sick during the flights, and held out until I arrived home.  I'll spare you the details, but it was not pretty and, in fact, one week later, I am still feeling the after effects.  This restaurant should be cited for undercooked food and food poisoning.  Further, even without the health incident, you will notice that the menu items all have the SAME exact ingredients.  This is mass-produced, poor-quality food clearly made by people who don't care and have no plans on ever seeing those who they serve again.  A likely scenario for an airport, but really unacceptable.  In closing, when faced with a food choice at Terminal 3 at PHX - avoid Blue Burrito at all costs.  While Wendy's may not be the best alternative, at least you know what you will get and know that it will be cooked properly.  Safe travels!"}
{"text":"Got a recommendation to eat here from a friend and was somewhat disappointed. Expecting a sit-down restaurant with wait service, I was surprised to find it layed out more like a fast food joint with the addition of a bar--kind of odd. The service was fast and friendly, but the food was average and didn't seem quite warm enough and got cold very fast as a result. The best part about dining here was the churro I picked up on my way out, which was surprisingly delicious. All in all, I don't see myself returning to the Blue Burrito Grille unless it's to pick up a churro or two after seeing a movie at the nearby theater."}
{"text":"Just awful. So called 'asada burrito' was cold and bland... just a lump of plain carnitas and some iceberg lettuce in a cheap tortilla. reminiscent of Taco Bell in the 90s but worse."}
{"text":"Had the fish tacos.  Corn tortillas were nice and moist/fresh, not rubbery. Fish was just okay. Didn't really like the small chunks of fish. I give it 3 stars because the sauce was terrible. It was kinda like salad dressing.  Tacos were drenched in it and it killed the whole meal...lose the sauce."}
{"text":"Great value for airport food, nice tender whole chicken pieces, real veggies, good spices, tasty salsa and generous portions make the chicken fajita rice bowl a winner my in my book."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Blue Burrito in years, not since it was the cool place to go before you went to a movie at Shea 14 in high school! I wanted to grab a quick lunch today to take back to the office, and while Chipotle is closer to my office, I just wasn't in the mood. I ordered the beef taquito and chicken soft taco combo, which came with a side of rice and beans. I waited less than 5 minutes until my order was ready, neatly packaged with salsa and chips thrown in as well.   I really liked the taquitos, they were still hot and were delicious dipped into the cool sour cream and guacamole that they came with. I am not normally a chicken taco kind of gal, but I found this chicken to be wonderful. It was grilled chicken, but it was very moist, not dry like you may find at other places. I just ate the chicken out of the tortilla, but I am sure it would b good wrapped in the blue (get it?) corn tortillas that it was intended for as well.   I normally am not a rice eater, but for some reason, this rice looked really good, and it was! It was tender and moist, but not greasy a all. I actually didn't even try the beans...I just went for the rice...weird!!   I sampled 3 of the 4 salsas that were offered, and none of them really had much flavor. They either just tasted like tomatoes or were just hot, so the salsa was definitely a disappointment. I will give them a nod for keeping their chips warm in a chip warmer, you don't see that too often.   My meal was cheap, coming in at under $8.00. I liked the food that I had, but the menu didn't knock my socks off....I think when it comes to fresh Mex, the number one for me is still Rubio's! (Crispy shrimp season is my weakness!)"}
{"text":"I found a yelp deal for this location of Blue Burrito, so I thought I'd give it a try. It's about 7 miles from my home, but I rode my bike because it was actually cloudy and nice for an August day. I ordered the build-your-own burrito with the grilled cod, sat at the bar, and had a couple blue margaritas with my meal. The cod was perfectly prepared and seasoned, the margaritas were refreshing, and the service was excellent! The staff are very friendly, the restaurant is impeccably clean, and they even have an outdoor patio with comfy seating.   Bonus - because the burrito was so large, I was only able to eat half. They wrapped it up for me, and placed it in a bag of ice, so I could take it with me (which was the only way I could get it to go, since I was on a bike, and though \"nice\" for AZ in August, still about 100°).  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the salsas are weak - none hot, none all that great. Otherwise, this place is fantastic, and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This was a great local find! I agree with other reviews comparing Blue Burrito to Baja Fresh. It fits into that same level of better than fast food, but not a true sit down restaurant. The build-you-own burritos are awesome! I absolutely loved the machaca chicken and that all of the optional ingredients are free. Nothing worse than having to pay $0.79 for a spoonful of guacamole at most Mexican places. Here, my burrito was STUFFED with delicious ingredients that I was able to pick out.   The chip and salsa bar is great. The salsas were fresh and flavorful.   The best part was the yelp deal, we got two burritos and drinks for a $10 deal. That's tough to beat! We will definitely be back soon! Always nice to find a good local business with great service and great food."}
{"text":"After a great week in Arizona, my family and I decided on one last southwestern meal before flying home. We lived in Arizona a long time and have many time enjoyed a meal at the Blue Burrito on Camelback and in Scottsdale. I wasn't expecting much from the airport so I was very surprised when everything we ordered turned out about as good as we remembered from the main restaurants. My son enjoyed the blue burrito, which sadly was not colored blue as it should have been. But it tasted great. I ordered carnitas tacos made on blue corn tortilla (which actually was blue colored) and it was delicious.  I would definitely eat here again and would not hesitate to recommend it to my fellow travelers."}
{"text":"I stop at the blue burrito about once every other week when I'm passing through PHX. I'm a big fan of the Works burrito for breakfast and the fajita burrito for lunch and dinner. If I have enough time to dine there, that great otherwise I will just head to the carryout. It's worth walking here from other terminals."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. I had the grilled shrimp burrito. On par with Baja Fresh or Rubios.  Mediocre staff. It was 2pm Friday and I got the impression all the help just wanted to leave. Big scary cook literally just tossed the chips in the general vicinity of my plate. 4 made it on. Bartender was pretty annoyed when I asked for news instead of sports. (No one else was watching) Turns out they don't get news, just 30 sports channels. Was a typical restaurant \"after the rush\" atmosphere."}
{"text":"Eh asada burrito was unimpressive and bordering on bad but I also adjusted since it's airport food...  Also, it was closing very soon, so maybe it was just a bad batch.  Unfortunately won't recommend =P"}
{"text":"After stepping off the plane hungry, I looked around the terminal for food as I walked to the next gate. \"Wait a minute, I'm in Arizona. I should get some southwestern style food or mexican food. Is that a burrito place? Surely it can't be bad.\" I ordered a #1, standard burrito. I take a bite. And another. \"Not bad I thought.\" Then I took another bite. And promptly spit it out.  The cheddar cheese in my burrito was moldy. And no, I'm sure it wasn't blue cheese. It was even obvious visually. After pointing the cheese out to the manager, she brushed it off as \"the bag was just opened, it's not possible\" even after showing the obvious mold. People around me started looking uncomfortable. Someone muttered \"wow\" and stepped out of the line.  The best part? I wasn't even offered a refund or a new burrito, or an apology for the moldy burrito. Are you kidding me?"}
{"text":"Great quick, healthy Mexican joint. Very casual and friendly staff. Order at the counter and they'll call you when it's ready. In the meantime, free chips and salsa (4 varieties). Must say, really good salsa.  Try: Chicken machaca burrito, smothered in green enchilada sauce, side of sour cream. Delicious."}
{"text":"Oh the joys of airport food. Generally most of it is (1) really expensive and (2) unfit for human consumption.   The Blue Burrito Grille is the best of a bunch of bad options in terminal C. Burrito was made fresh, reasonably warm, and didn't taste terrible. I was a little concerned when the cashier didn't know what cilantro was, but the end result was ok.   It wasn't cheap though. One burrito, one rice bowl, a snapple and a coke does not = $23 value to me. But from what I've read elsewhere on Yelp, it's far less than we would have paid next door and a lot better.   So it's only moderately expensive and is fit for human consumption. And for airport food, that equals three stars."}
{"text":"What a HUGE disappointment. I had gone to BBG back when they had a location on Central Ave. That closed and I would go out of my way to go to the location on Shea Blvd in Scottsdale. Then I learned they had closed. The website said they had a new location at the the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall. I took my family there thinking it would be the experience I remembered it being. NOT EVEN close!!! The BBG in the mall is nothing more than one of 12 or so fast food outlets in the food court. The food is terrible and on a good day is nothing but a Chipotle wanna-be. A real shame. There is an old saying ... if you cannot do it right, don't do it at all. Advise to BBG, go back to your roots and only have one location if you have to. What you have become will not last long. I for one, will not be back."}
{"text":"The hot salsa is delicious.  I always end up getting the Chicken Machacca Burrito. It's tasty and fills you up.  Service is friendly, too."}
{"text":"Best healthy mexican food around. I crave it."}
{"text":"Its a burrito stand in an airport. Come on people, what do you expect. However, their chorizo breakfast burrito is pretty damn good. I've been known to schedule my eastbound flights to allow enough layover to have a breakfast burrito.  BUT!  They recently went from a good salsa in a small plastic cup to packets of Tapatio. BOOO!!     Nothing against Tapatio, but the salsa was what made their chorizo burritos worthwhile. Bummer."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 4 stars for the grande margarita.  OMG, it was tasty.  It is not cheap at $8.50 but it is soo good.  One of the better margs I have had in a long time.  It ranks up there in the top 5.  Wasn't real busy when we went here and I haven't been to this particular location.  I decided on the taco plate.  My only complaint was that the machaca was a little salty IMO and I like salt.  The beans and rice were just ok nothing special."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE is nothing but SUCKS!   I ordered the dry chicken, microwaveable-\"Mexican\" rice bowl and it was disgusting. The veggies were mushy and over \"sautéed\" almost drowning in oil and the fake, industrial-tasting flour tortillas are so gross.   To make things worst, I get two Perrier waters and it came to $8 for both! NO THANKS! And when I tried to return them, Ms. Patty who rang me up, gave me so much attitude. I could care less about it, I am not paying $8 for carbonated water. She said \"I have to get the manager *rolls eyes, gives me the \"you little punk look\"*, and I said \"i have an hour layover, so I'm not going anywhere\"  Horrible experience and I beg you, please just go elsewhere. I ended up getting free water from SBUX, instead of throwing away $8. Hopefully  LAS gets better food and soon.  Just go to the slot machines and make better use of your $$$ there."}
{"text":"bf and i ate here when we had a couple hours to kill before we headed home... i got a taco salad w/shredded beef and my bf got the machaca burrito both items came with chips and salsa... this was by no means what id really consider good Mexican food.. same caliber as baja fresh/ Chipotle. but the food wasn't bad at all. our total w/ two sodas tax and tip came out to around 30bucks. friendly waitress was quick and always refilled our drinks and even brought us drinks in to-go cups @ the end so we wouldn't have to go out n pay for another drink.  i dunno if they have full bar but they do have margaritas :)  i'd come back if  i ever had a long layover or time to kill before a flight..."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  Utterly disgusting.  I had their trademark Blue Burrito and nothing about it was good.  All I wanted was one last good burrito  before leaving Arizona, and I should have eaten at the BK nearby. Yes, it was that bad.  STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"I knew I would have a fairly long layover at LAS but decided to quickly Google for decent food instead of Yelp. What a mistake.  I skimmed several websites that gave this place good marks so I decided to try it out.   Bland flavors, dry meat (I got the \"special\"), soggy iceberg lettuce and tortilla, watered-down tasteless pico.   Thought about giving this place 2 stars considering it's airport food but decided against it for the $9.72 I paid.  I had thorough time to explore terminal C. I'll probably be sticking with Burger King next time I'm back."}
{"text":"Local Biz Alert!!  I had no idea this was a local business for years. I remember seeing them in the airport, then in Scottsdale Fashion Square, and recently after looking for some good Mexican food near Scottsdale Shea Healthcare to take my girl to lunch I noticed a Yelp Deal for this place and thought it was finally worth a shot.   It was not until I walked up to the front door and noticed the Local First AZ Sticker that I knew it was locally owned. Sorry for taking all your time to mention that, it's important to me.   So to the restaurant, it's your typical fast casual restaurant, you order, pick up your food with a number, get your own drinks, salsa, but a waitress comes around to refill your drinks or clear away empty plates.   The food was pretty delicious. HUGE portions. For sure something that can be shared, or eat half of it and take it back to work for lunch the next day.  The ingredients tasted fresh and the menu looked exciting enough to where I had trouble picking something and I look forward to going back and trying something new, like the enchiladas.   The salsa bar and chips deserves its own paragraph. If you like Baja Fresh's salsa bar, then you'll also like Blue Burrito's. I believe there was 4 different salsa options, plus cilantro. Then there is a big container of fresh chips. They were still warm and very tasty. It's all you can eat for the salsa and chips which is awesome!!  Next time we go back, I want to get a margarita too!"}
{"text":"I ordered Asada Burrito with beef. Wow! It is Big! One bite another bite all I taste was lettuce. I cut burrito into half I found lettuce and discolored avocado! Oops,Looks like discolored avocado but it was burned meat. If you like $6.90 lettuce burrito this is the place!"}
{"text":"Finally a place where my kids and I both love the food that doesn't serve chicken nuggets and fries! My kids love Blue Burrito's kids chicken quesadilla, especially the churro that is included. I love their salads and taco plates. The free chips and salsa bar is a big hit with the family. The place is always super clean and the staff is very friendly.  The perfect place for lunch on their new patio now that the weather is cooler."}
{"text":"Awesome nachos for anAirport take away! Good prices and very filling!"}
{"text":"Not bad when you're looking for something healthy after only having the option of a sesame seed bagel with peanut butter on your hellish overnight stay in Columbus's CMH.  Not awful pricing either for airport food.  Tortilla is a little floury, and it's not strictly authentic mexican food, but it is probably your healthiest option here for the price.  I got guac extra on my veggie burrito.  And believe me - a big burrito is NOT what you want just before getting on a plane.  You'll end up passing out and wake up with angry people who have requested a seat reassignment.  Small burritos at airports rock.  What, you're going to save it in your bag for tomorrow?  Good luck with that . . ."}
{"text":"It's Mexican fast I don't expect much. But overpriced. More than chipotle and not as fresh I think. This is my second visit, and maybe last? I got the nachos both time but I take most stuff off. Last time because I didn't want gauc they doubled my sour cream. Well this time I asked for a little more cheese, she charged me! I didn't get the gauc or beans lets not be cheap!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant if you are in the mood for fresh and healthy style Mexican food and do not want to pay extra money to be waited on hand and foot.  I am from California, and the closest thing I can compare it to would be Baja Fresh, but Blue Burrito has a full service bar which is a really nice addition.  The only negative thing I noticed was the mini taco soft shells.  They are about the diameter of an orange which is a little strange.  They do provide an unlimited supply of chips and salsa so that helps.  The burritos are large.  Everything seems very fresh and they don't use lard of other unhealthy additives.  They need to open one of these in L.A..  I would go there all the time."}
{"text":"Good little burrito stand in the Phoenix airport.  Service wasn't great, but never is in airports.  Ordered blue tacos with chicken, very tasty.  If you're nearby, I recommend."}
{"text":"Had some time to kill at the airport so I decided to come here for some Mexican food!   -Their signature burrito was about $8... -I had their rice bowl for $7 (spanish rice, steak, chili, and veggies) I was expecting some huge bowl full of the ingredients mentioned, but the bowl was so dinky I finished it in less than five minutes! I mean it was really good and all, but the size and portion was not worth that! -Fiji water was 5$!!!!!  I'm not really a big fan of fast food (burger king, McDonald's, etc...)when I'm on vacation so I like to try places like this one! Lesson learned though, eat before heading to the airport!!!"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, inexpensive, and delicious.   The meat in both the chicken tacos and beef flautas were perfectly marinated (not steamed, cut up, and drowned in salsa) and cooked slowly. Fresh tortillas, too. Salsa was very good.  Rice and beans were on the \"pretty good\" side of \"Ok\". (The airport location is not nearly as good)."}
{"text":"In a hurry in the Phoenix airport and saw Blue Burrito Grille. Ordered the Big Blue Burrito with pork. Unlike a previous reviewer, I got a LARGE burrito with plenty of fillings including some very tasty pork. The salsa was also very good. Their website says that the burritos come with chips and there was a huge bin of them on the counter but alas my burrito came sans chips... which I didn't notice until after I was on the airplane. A good place for a quick Mexican lunch but make sure you get the chips."}
{"text":"the blue burrito is decent.. not quite authentic Mexican style, but this is an airport and for a quick bite in between flights it was a reasonable option and the price was OK by airport standards"}
{"text":"Blue Burrito is an average Mexican restaurant for quick sub par food. It is located in a shopping center that at one time used to be very popular before Kierland and Scottsdale Quarter were built. I would recommend the \"Build your own Burrito\" that way you can pick and choose what you want. They also offer a chips and salsa bar which makes it convenient for those who pig out on chips and salsa."}
{"text":"With a quick layover in Phoenix, I did some research and found there was a vegan-friendly Mexican eatery right in the airport. Blue Burrito Grille is its name and lard-free beans are its game.  It offered a limited menu in the airport that included breakfast, burritos, favorites, and salads. I went with the vegetarian burrito with no-lard black beans, grilled peppers & onions, lettuce, and guacamole. I added the guacamole and asked them to hold the cheese. With it, they gave me some of the Tappato \"hot\" sauce.  The burrito really wasn't that good, but I was happy to have a real meal. The beans and veggies were pretty flavorless and the hot sauce wasn't that great either. And there was so little guacamole that it didn't add much to the meal. That said, if I'm ever in this airport again, I'd eat here again because the options are limited and this sure was better than nothing."}
{"text":"Always consistent, great and healthy Mexican food! Same cook since I can remember. I can grab a chicken fajita bowl with chicken, rice, pinto beans and a tortilla and it all comes in under 500 calories with about 5 grams of fat. Extremely tasty and I enjoy the spicy and rojo salsas. I never have to wait long for my meal and always enjoy a house margarita for $2.99. They also have a Blue Burrito card that you can get stamped each time and on your 10th visit you get $5 off. If you want some healthy options I would recommend BBQ over Chipotle. I respect a place that shows the calories and fat in their dishes and gives people options to enjoy good food that is healthier than the usual lard loaded, calorie disguised foods.   I only wish they offered baked tortilla chips similar to what Top Shelf does."}
{"text":"Not bad for airport food (Terminal C in Las Vegas' McCarran Int'l Airport) - it actually felt like a decent burrito. I got the Green Chili Pork Burrito for $7 and change + tax = $8.10 It had pretty good pork and chili sauce, along with filler of rice and beans. or maybe it's healthier that way. anyway, i was filled and pleased.  They also do breakfast burritos.  They do sell bottled beverages (no fountain drinks), but for $3+ for a drink, i'd stick to the water fountain a little further down the terminal."}
{"text":"blue burrito grille - mexican redefined... my question is... redefined to what?  dont think good mexican needed to be redifined in the first place... when they say your burrito comes wtih sour cream and guac... its like a thin thin layer spread by a butter knife.... failed..."}
{"text":"Great place. The black bean burrito is my favorite by far, though I am occasionally tempted by the vegetarian taco salad. Pablo (hot) salsa is the absolute best. I could drink that stuff!"}
{"text":"The location that is not at the mall stinks. You can't see what they are putting in your burrito and it doesn't represent the chain well. If one of your stores has all it's food in the open , then the other one should too. The Shea location is cavernous and not personable at all to customers. The food quality was poorer, the price was higher and nothing tasted the same as it was in that glorious food court location. The burrito was overloaded with black beans, skimped on the meat and it was  a mushy, not well rolled food item. This is a clueless chain because chains mean continuity and this location lowered the standards on all their other restaurants. Waste of a meal and almost 9 bucks for a burrito."}
{"text":"Never trust a restaurant, especially if it's in an airport, that doesn't list its prices on the menu.  Or server constantly tried to recommend expensive options, but the price was a mystery! For a serving of wet yet burnt nachos and two margaritas, $40...wait, $40?!   The nachos were so disgusting, we ate two bites and left the rest.  The margaritas were ok, but NOT $14 apiece ok. Beware! Eat at McDonald's...at least you know it's mostly consistent."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here when we were in town for the B&J auto auction.  The food was good and affordable.  We liked the fact that they had a full bar and we were able to have a couple of tasty Margaritas.  Staff was friendly overall we had a good dining experience."}
{"text":"I LOVE Blue Burrito.  Unfortunately, I no longer live in AZ, but when I did, I was here once a week at least.  Everything is super healthy and delicious.  I highly recommend the Machaca Chicken Burrito, it is the best!"}
{"text":"This is a tried and true place.  Perfect spot for a large group or if you have kids with you. The prices are also very reasonable, its casual and there is unlimited salsa and chips from the salsa bar.  My favorite item is the beef burrito!   Overall a great family spot."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time this past Saturday night. It was aWESOME!  Description: Blue Burrito Grille is very much like a Chipotle, Baja Fresh, or Rubios, only probably better than all 3. There are no servers. There have the typical Mexican fast food condiment bar, but complete with chips.   In comparison to similar establishments, Blue Burrito Grille offers    -Better Chips. Tri-colored restaurant style chips that are NOT stale     like Rubios and Baja Fresh.    -A wider variety dishes, combination platters, salsas, and meats.        E.g. Cod, shrimp, Mahi Mahi, Grilled Chicken, Machaca Chicken,  Beef, Carnitas, Steak?     - A wider variety of wraps/torillas. For health-nuts, like me, they offer spinach or multigrain wraps instead of the typical boring flour or corn torillas.     -A better variety of teas as well as beers. They use China mist teas and have a descent variety.  ** The Salsa Verde alone is worth the trip!!! I make my own salsas at home all the time and I will tell you this is the best Salsa Verde I've ever had. I could drink that salsa by itself! (In fact, i did a little when i got home -- i took some to go).  I will definitely be Back."}
{"text":"Bought a deal on Yelp after driving by this place for the last three months.  The staff were incredibly nice and attentive.  The food was just okay.  I really did not care for the pinto beans they use.  They had an odd spice/aftertaste.  The quesadilla was an average quesadilla.  If I go back I would skip the beans. but wouldn't mind hanging out here with coworkers."}
{"text":"Decent mexican food considering it's in an airport.  3 stars cuz the prices weren't bad, again, considering it's in an airport.  I like the selection of tequila's they have.  Good size bar and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fresh, healthy, quick and tasty, The Blue Burrito is a sure bet. We recently tried the Shea/Scottsdale Rd. location (NE corner), which has a very attractive bar. The whole restaurant has a modern, comfortable, welcoming feel, but the long bar really caught our attention. It's the perfect place to come after work to enjoy a drink, some socializing, not spend a lot or wait long for your food.  We originally ordered only iced teas until we saw how reasonably priced the margaritas were, which were delicious and refreshing.  The staff was friendly, patient, helpful and exuded the feeling that they liked working there. I even chatted a bit with Memo the cook, whose open kitchen was clean and orderly.  As for the food, it's very satisfying and will cause next-day cravings! My husband orders the shrimp burrito, which is really big! I must have the machaca beef tacos and our little one likes the cheese quesadillas. The rice and beans are good sides, but the free chips,  pico de gallo and the available salsas are positively addictive!   This location is now our favorite Blue Burrito :)"}
{"text":"With one hell-of-a-layover, and starving I decided to stop at the Blue Burrito Grille in the Phoenix International Airport. I had many, many choices but this restaurant's friendly and warm ambience lured me in. I sat down to a semi-cleaned table that I had to wipe clean myself. Ok. Bad. But not that bad. I was quickly greeted and offered a drink. Looking over the menu my stomach told me to go with the chicken burrito. I hadn't had mexican food for quite some time, and the restaurant was bragging that they were known for their burritos so, bonus! Bring it on. The menu read that it came with all the ingredients that you would expect from a super burrito. It was delivered fairy quickly and cut in half, which I normally do not prefer. Come on now, I'm a big boy now, I don't someone cutting my food into smaller pieces anymore. At first glance it looked pretty tasty, and then I took a bite. Disappointment set in and if it wasn't for my gross need for nourishment at that point I would sent it back and left. This large burrito had no flavor what-so-ever, except for the taste of leftover chicken that has been reheated. There was absolutely no seasoning, and one third of the burrito was shredded lettuce. Adding the accompanying hot sauce did no good either. I don't know what to say. I had another bad airport food experience, again, on this trip. And, apparently, the people who were sitting two tables away were having their own bad experience as well, so bad, that they got up and left. In the end, SEASON YOUR MEAT! YOUR FOOD! Ambience is nice but food, especially mexican, usually has great flavor, so give it to us. Now that I am home I will be visiting my favorite taco truck in Oakland where I can get a real, authentic, great tasting burrito."}
{"text":"Don't eat here. One of the worst burritos I have ever had. It was almost all tortilla and they didn't add the guac I paid extra for. Gross."}
{"text":"Good burrito.  A bit overpriced for what they offered, but airport food is always a bit more expensive. Regardless of the price, I thought it was a good breakfast burrito. And they had it out pretty fast."}
{"text":"It's 7:00 a.m. with nothing really good for breakfast open while waiting for our flight. We came upon here thinking...could we want Mexican food so early? Well of course...love the stuff.  I ordered the Chicken Big Blue Burrito which was delicious. Hubby got the breakfast burrito and didn't say a peep, so I'm not sure his thoughts. I was in a flavor heaven with all the wonderful seasonings coming together in this wrapped up tortilla. It's a must try. I have to add that the Burrito is a good size. I could not finish it off. Hubby had to take over and he loved it. I believe more than his breakfast burrito based on his attack on the thing.  We got some chips and salsa on the side. Even those were good with the blue chips mixed in. There were 2 types of salsa that did a nice burn in our mouths just like we like it. We are chilli junkies what can I say.  What I want to know is...will Blue Burrito Grille be coming to California? We like it!"}
{"text":"Ordered the \"Big Blue\" burrito expecting that the size of the burrito would have lived up to the name.   Perhaps since I didn't expect the burrito to be blue, I shouldn't have expected it to be big either. :-)  The pork burrito was just ok."}
{"text":"I just got a carnitas rice bowl with a small drink for a tad less than $10.  The food was good enough.  I'm glad that I stopped here instead of at one of the California Pizza Kitchen outlets in this terminal.  Now on to the next flight..."}
{"text":"Great value, food was excellent as was the service.  Definitely recommend.  Love the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Life's funny.   Not HaHa funny. Just funny how you can go back to the same restaurant fifteen months later and end up ordering the exact same meal, though not intentionally. LOL  We came to the Blue Burrito after a movie in January, 2012. The only reason I know that is the Tip I wrote on Yelp:  \"Make your own burrito bowl $7.99, Chicken Torta $7.99 and one ice tea came to $19.59. A very tasty meal and a great deal!\"  Not a lot has changed since then. The above meal ran us $15.25 this time. The Chicken Rice Bowl was reduced to $6.59. The food was okay just nothing special.   The photos of the Chicken Torta on the menu look good, but for some reason they do not toast it as they show in picture. The bottom piece of bread is soggy and beaks apart. It's impossible to pickup.  Till next time then.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"This place really is A-OK.  Loved the fact that they had a green chili burrito.  My own little slice of New Mexico.  This location oddly doesn't sell fountain drinks and has over-priced bottled drinks.  The people working here were nice, so it's worth a stop -- definitely the best cheap option in this terminal."}
{"text":"Perhaps expected in an airport terminal, but the burrito my wife and I had were just barely food. The lettuce was browned and the wrap soggy. The only redeeming point was the beans are lard-free."}
{"text":"This is the worst burrito I've ever had. Although, it is the best food value you can find in Terminal C. I had the veggie burrito and it was terrible. The tortilla smelled like bleach and was absolutely stale. The grilled veggies inside were okay but as a unit, I couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Oh black beans....how I love thee.  Blue Burrito Grille has a healthier menu, such as those black beans and whole wheat tortillas, which is great.  I've came here to both pick up a meal and sit down and eat.....never having to wait more than 5 minutes for my food.  They have several high top tables, outdoor patio seating, a yummy salsa/chip bar, and alcohol.  The house margarita is okaaay.    Bottom line....if I'm feeling \"fast\" mexican food and a lot of it, I'll head to Chipotle and down a burrito.  When I'm feeling health conscious, I head here."}
{"text":"Very good burritos. Best food inside security."}
{"text":"Blue Burrito is the perfect combination of non-greasy mexican food, chearful staff, bottomless chips, salsa and drinks and no push to turn the tables.  The food is very tasty and healthy and the \"impact\" is not the same as with traditional mexican food.  The full bar, local sports on the screens only adds more reasons I make a weekly stop for a salsa fix.  The outdoor patio is also a nice touch for those evenings when the sunset is a thing of beauty.  I have yet to find a menu item that was not tasty."}
{"text":"Was catching an early morning flight and this place was a life saver. The burritos were made fresh and they had quite some options to choose. I had to grab one fast before the flight and the service was quick and super easy. I would recommend this place for pit stoppers at Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"I'm still trying to figure out if this is fast food.  I suppose that technically the quick answer is yes, since you do go up and order your food and get a number.  But the dining area looks more like a normal restaurant, complete with a bar and high top tables.  And more people seemed to be hanging out there having a leisurely meal compared to those picking stuff up to go.  I appreciate that they have some \"healthy\" options and provide the nutritional content of these items (although to really be healthy you should only eat about half of the portion).  While it was comforting to know that we could eat healthy there if we wanted to, my friend and I of course shared the nachos with chicken and the big burrito, which were not \"lite\" in any way, shape, or form.    I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and quality of the nachos and burrito.  I'm pretty picky about chicken, especially fast food chicken, and theirs was actually pretty good.  It tasted fresh and had a nice normal texture, unlike at, say, Chipotle.  I liked the little chips and salsa bar too.              I just have one suggestion for Blue Burrito: get rid of the styrofoam, especially for dine-in."}
{"text":"I've tried a few things here, and there have been some hits and misses.  The Burritos are a little sloppy, so I usually grab a quesadilla.  Stay away from the taco salad, but mini-chimi's and cheap margaritas give it that 3rd star!"}
{"text":"Blue Burrito is the little place that tries hard.  Go back, say ten years, and this store would be a very hot item.  That's before Chipotle started their global conquest. But we cannot go back in time. Well, at least not yet.    Blue Burrito makes your burrito along a assembly line process.  You choose how you want it -- burrito, bowl or salad.  Sound familiar?  Then you choose which meats or fish options you want.  Finally, you add your veggie fix-ins.  And, poof!  You're on your way.  Okay, I need to back up.  The meats and fish are basic, though good. The tortilla comes in either  flour or wheat.  Most recently I tried the wheat and found it tasty.  The veggies they offer, come in only a small quantity and appear to be reasonably fresh.   Surprisingly, I've found their Veggie Burrito the best and more interesting than either the meat/fish option.  It had a lot of flavor and they didn't up-charge $2.00 for the Guacamole!  LOL  I've never understood Chipotle on doing this, since avocados are normally two for a buck.    So, go to the Blue Burrito. It's what Yelp'er Matt D said, a: \"good mall burrito\"."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town -- the fact that it is healthy is a bonus (that is if you can resist those warm chips)! I've never been disappointed and have been a customer for 17 years!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst burritos I've ever had.  Given that PHX is a short distance from Mexico, this was appalling.  Their menu is totally bizarre. The two older hispanic gentlemen  behind me, spent a good 5 minutes going back and forth in spanish trying to figure out on earth their discombobulated menu was all about.  My chicken burrito contained: a cake-like tortilla (not warmed, not grilled), a handful of lettuce, an few measly pieces of chicken and a dallop of sour cream. No beans. No rice. Plastic container of what seemed like Pace Picante salsa on the side. Total dissapointment."}
{"text":"For airport Mexican food I will give it a little credit.  My suggestion is keep it simple, order something like a quesadilla where odds of failure are really low and you'll probably come out alright."}
{"text":"It takes very little in a burrito to satisfy me. Mainly, it's fresh ingredients. In a pinch, I can even enjoy Taco Bell.    I threw my veggie burrito away uneaten. It was just bad. Stale, tasteless, and soggy. Finally decided on CPK for my second dinner, but Burger King would have still been way better than Blue Burrito Grill."}
{"text":"Seriously if your Jones' n for anything remotely healthy..or to take on your flight , because no airline caters coach 100%.. & even if that pre 9-11 perk does come back.. Just say eh eh., no... The B B is open early & crew members love this place. You can get vegetarian Mexican fare, and they will foil it for you for the trip.. I always get a vegetarian breakfast burrito..& after I'm done being fly sky godess.. I have it & usually warm.. So for airport cuisine.. This is pretty 'fly'..   Ps.. Located in T4 , near high A gates.. :-)"}
{"text":"I was starving; it was 2pm after a tough hike up Camelback Mountain.  We came here at my friends from NY suggestions. I already had doubts when New Yorkers are suggesting the Mexican food.  The menu here is quite large and it took me some time to decide on the grilled fish burrito with a whole-wheat tortilla. It was a bit pricy for just a burrito.  Before our food was ready, I discovered the chips and salsa bar. Naturally, I had to try every salsa, and with the multi colored chips I tried to get mostly blue chips, they have a neat side effect.  The salsas were fine nothing too special. The same can be said about my burrito, which I quickly devoured. It was not bad, but I am not going to make the long drive to go back just for another burrito.  If you are looking for indistinct inoffensive Mexican food this may be a good place for you."}
{"text":"Decent vegi burrito. Not mind blowing, but not bad either. Service was friendly and they got me my burrito quickly.  One of the better and quicker options for vegi folks in the airport."}
{"text":"After a lot of great food in Scottsdale, I grabbed a couple of chicken tacos here prior to a Delta flight. The service was good and the food came quickly. However, the chicken was seriously overcooked. (In retrospect, this beats the alternative). I read a lot of good reviews, so maybe I hit this place on a really bad day of holiday travel.   Dried chicken taco's = yuck! I'm starving, so I ate these anyhow. Next time I'll try the burrito!"}
{"text":"Shitty burrito served by an angry old hippy.  I asked if the guac had onions, and he answered \"yeah, but you can't taste it!\" to which I replied \"then why's it there\" and then he said \"for flavor, but you can't taste it\"  then said angry old hippy talked smack about me to his coworker while I was still in earshot.  Worst burrito ever made by someone who honestly doesn't dig his job.  He lacked customer service, a sense of humor and the ability to whisper.  Fuck you old hippy & fuck you blue burrito!"}
{"text":"The Big Blue (Chicken) Burrito was remarkably tasteless. The only reason I gave this place 2 stars was the prices are good and the food seemingly fresh. Good luck in Concourse C...you're going to need it."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's fast food in a healthier Mexican style, not fast greasy Filiberto's style (but let's be honest, that style is still delicious) food.  Two key highlights to my five star review (1) self serve Salsa Bar (2) Full Bar! Yes, my friends, you can order your healthy Mexican food and then completely ignore the health of your liver and indulge in an alcoholic beverage, WIN!   The lady taking our order at the counter was really nice. The food was ready really quickly and the salsa bar was well kept! I got the fajita burrito that was cooked and wrapped to perfection! There are plenty of tables to sit at inside as well as outside on the patio."}
{"text":"Disappointed, just another Mex chain restaurant.  Pro: clean and spacey, friendly staff, easy parking, very nice salsa bar with all the chips (fresh) and salsa you wish, dishes have quite large portions of pork and chicken in them as well as green pepper, their green chili sauce is very tasty.  Con: chicken has no flavor, somewhat dry, skimpy on the onions in the fajita burrito, all the sauces taste alike and none are hot, crispy taco just fell apart, was truly finger food.  I would rate them 2 1/2 stars.  Obviously, we won't be back!"}
{"text":"Boring food, but at least you know what you're expecting.  Aptly named place, but I didn't think they knew that they were talking about their customers being blue after they received their order.  They're going to make you a boring tasteless burrito in a chain place where no one cares."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to try this place, as it hasn't really been reviewed well. However, I'm glad I trusted my gut (not the hungry part, the sensible part)!  When I walked in, the dining room was absolutely packed! Obviously, it's a popular destination. So, I took a minute to see what looked best to me. After a few minutes perusing their menu, I opted for the Shrimp Burrito. The young lady behind the counter informed me that it would take about five minutes for my order to be ready. So, I took my drink to the dining room and waited.  As I was waiting, I passed by their full bar. I wasn't really in the market for an alcoholic beverage during lunch, so I didn't really price anything. The fact that this bar exists, though...that's the important thing! The self-serve chips and salsa bar was really cool! It's similar to ones that you would find at Baja Fresh, except for the endless chips. That's a pretty nice touch, in my opinion.  After about five minutes (a touch longer, but I wasn't in a hurry), my burrito was ready. Size wise, my burrito was comparable to ones that you find at Chipotle or Qdoba. However, the difference maker for me was the actual content. I made sure to pay extra close attention to the amount of shrimp contained in my burrito. I've been burned at places before when they skimped on contents. Not here. EVERY single bite I took was accompanied by a full shrimp...and I don't take small bites. For $8.85, I was definitely impressed.   If you're in the market for a sort of change of pace with regards to your Mexican food, you should check out Blue Burrito Grille. If you need more incentive, they do have a couple of televisions, free Wi-Fi, and a nice patio. The patio is covered by umbrellas, but it doesn't have misters or anything like that. So, if you want to sit outside, make sure you get in on the action before it gets hot!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos. Great, no, but good. Simple cod with that purple cabbage on a soft white tortilla. Skipped the cream sauce.  Salsa bar looked good, yeah I just looked. You get chips, $8. I did have trouble ordering, which was a good thing. The selections are many. You order at the register and wait for your lucky number to be called out kind of place."}
{"text":"Although I am not from the Scottsdale area, nor am I even from Arizona or Mexico I do however enjoy a good hearty burrito when I am able to get one.  The Blue Burrito provides just what I am looking for. The place is modeled after a rather \"upscale\" type of \"neuvo\" Mexican Cantina where you \"Belley up to the bar\" so to speak and order what you so desire to eat or drink.  The restaurant is clean, the staff is usually busy, but always helpful. The food is really clean and really good. Having been deep into Mexico and thus I have patronized many restaurants there, I can truly say that this is much better.   Not to downplay real Mexican food, which is superb in its own right, however the food in Mexico is often cooked in an excessive amount of lard, and is just indigestible at times.  There is also a chips and salsa bar, which I found to be very enjoyable. They also serve alcohol, but I have never ordered anything but soft drinks there.  The Blue Burrito is very good for an AMERICAN STYLE burrito. It is worth the money. You will not leave there hungry.  Whenever I am in the area, I always go there with my son who attends college in Phoenix.  Having been to many many burrito restaurants throughout the east and west coast of the USA, I have to put this on my list of favorites."}
{"text":"You know whats really fucked up about this place? Its consistency. For instance, if you eat in the dining room you get a burrito so damn big that you cant finish it! Seriously, this thing was humongous and pretty much full on burrito madness. It tasted alright, very  in line with Chipotle or any other shitty corporate burrito joint, nothing special I assure you except for its girth.    So on our return trip to there airport we deiced to get a burrito but this time ordered it from the counter instead and had it to go. We deiced that we would only order 1 since they are so damn big. I'm not sure if in the 2 days that we gone and came back they had some serious changes or what? This burrito was so chicken shit and terribly small we wondered if there was a problem, kids size maybe? Anyways of course I asked and was told that was the normal to-go size.   That's pretty much bullshit anyway you cut it. If you're going to sell a burrito, sell the same one whether you dine in or take out. So if you're in a pinch like we were, order your food in the dining room from a waiter, NOT to-go."}
{"text":"Oh airport food, always sad . . . .  Plenty of seating in this colorful cantina.  The sports play on the big screens and the waitresses are pretty quick and friendly.  A simple menu makes it easy to order - we decided to split the big blue burrito.  It really is huge!!!  The steak was dry, not very flavorful, the tortilla seemed dry too and overall it was a sad bland burrito.  Comes with light fluffy chips and a bland salsa too.  Tons of food for about $8 - so it's a good deal but just not very good food.    Our waitress was fairly attentive and made sure we had what we needed.  Overall the service was nice but not amazing.  I don't blame her though.  I also didn't like that they had the super cheap plastic cups and plastic utensils.  Eh .. . . ."}
{"text":"Blue Burrito Grille in all its Southwestern, Arizona chain glory, is a shell of its self in the airport version. It is instead a haven for hungry travelers, all willing to pay the marked up prices while expecting a lackluster burrito. It is true when the food is neither life changing nor cheap, but this BBG will do when the pickins are as slim as Sky Harbor Airport.  More likely to be a coincidence of my flights, I seem to be around whenever there is a decent sized line of folks. Contemplating on ordering a burrito while your departing flight is boarding? Aim for the plane - BBG workers aren't going to assemble a burrito and dress it in the time that you need. Service isn't exactly bustling here and knowing the burrito is going to be subpar is going to make one why you bothered to pay $9-11 for it in the first place.  Instead of ordering the usual asada burritos, my secret weapon is to try to score one of their breakfast burritos during the morning. They're cheaper, the same size, and often more fresh than others since they have to be cooked on the spot. People who aren't fans of burritos can take their chances with a taco salad, which sits inside of a shell bowl, but is largely unappealing. Finally, the quesadillas are a popular option, but they cost nearly as much as the burritos with significantly less portion.  The sad part is the other options in the terminal aren't much better. It might be better to sneak out of the airport entirely for some tortilla action at Carolina's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/carolinas-mexican-food-phoenix). Your tastebuds and wallet will thank you for it."}
{"text":"I have a large collection of plastic cups from Blue Burrito Grill. We used to go there on Fridays. When i gave up meat for awhile, we would come here and I would eat the fish burritos. Delicious."}
{"text":"I grabbed what I had hoped would be a quick bite to eat here. Let's just say it wasn't quick. Rather than having time to eat the food, I had to sprint for the gate with my middling burrito finally in hand. I mean, for an airport burrito, it wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't great either. Standard airport prices + sloth like speed + mediocre fare = 2 stars."}
{"text":"Decent airport food.  I usually am here in the AM, so I do breakfast.  The pork carnitas burrito is awesome (for the airport). Its made to order so you can substitute as you like it. (For me no cheese and sub black beans instead of potatoes)  Also they give A LOT of food (I usually can't quite finish the whole burrito by myself) so you get a bang for your buck (um, FINALLY an airport restaurant that doesn't follow the code of \"shitty and overpriced\")  Also the coffee has a nice flavor (not the normal burnt black that I actually LOVE), and it comes in one of those taller glass mugs (I would prefer a regular mug, but I guess it makes it look nicer?)  Overall one of the cozier places I've hit up in the airport."}
{"text":"BLAH is really all I can think of.  Blah, Blah, Blah.  Everything tasted the same.  Everything!  I got an open chicken burrito which is basically a burrito in a bowl, opened.  It had chicken, rice, cheese, peppers, onions and the shell.    I ate a piece of chicken, tasted like the grill.  I ate some rice, tasted like the **Burnt** grill. I ate an onion, tasted like the grill.  I are a pepper, tasted like the grill.  I ate the cheese, tasted like a burnt grill with cheese on top.   YUCK!  I ate about 4 forks full and was so disgusted I had to chuck it.  Fail of an airport dinner to the max!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while but my lunch was good on this recent visit.  The chips are fresh and I love their rojo salsa.  My two enchilada combo with rice and beans made for a nice meal."}
{"text":"your dining options are quite limited at this terminal..   but this place is not bad for an airport burrito.. prices are decent too.."}
{"text":"Ok, so it wasn't an AMAZING burrito, but for airport fare, it was top notch.  Seriously, healthy food is hard to come by in airports- I always find myself grabbing a yogurt amidst the sea of french fries and cinnamon roles that are abundant in airports.  This time I was able to scarf down something healthy during my short layover in Phoenix.  No lard or MSG and plenty of vegetarian options.  Prices are fantastic- I spent $6 on a vegetarian burrito with chips, salsa and guacamole.  There was a neighboring Mexican sit-down restaurant with a fully stocked bar."}
{"text":"With delta agent not knowing when we are leaving, I took chance and ordered take out here.  Not expecting much from airport food, yet to my surprise the blue burrito was quite edible. In fact I actually liked it very much. I'm sure my next seats didn't appreciate my sneaky deadly hello from rear end...."}
{"text":"Having to wait for the plane, I decided to stop by the place next to this to sit and get something to eat.  I didn't know at the time, but basically it was food from the Blue Burrito they get through a window and they serve their own drinks.    It was well worth coming in and sitting down to eat.  The burrito was great and the salsa was excellent as well.  The chips were just store bought, but everything else was great.  I would say it's some of the best airport food I've eaten."}
{"text":"No beans in a carnitas burrito?? Wtf?  I arrived in the Phoenix airport tired and hungry after being stuck on a crappy flight in steerage from the other side of the country.  I needed some food in me and there were very few choices.  The service was fast and the people at the counter friendly enough.  The burrito itself was disappointing and unhealthy without the benefit of being flavorful.  It is one thing to indulge in a guilty pleasure (think cake, donut, similar) and trade the fat and highly refined grains in exchange for something delicious every now and again.  But to get a white flour tortilla with unremarkable meat and nothing else is hardly worth the calories.  How about some guac or salsa (inside the burrito), some flavor in the meat, or at least some BEANS?  Fail.  I got on my next flight unsatisfied, with sticky fingers from the burrito falling apart on me, and a vow to never return here again."}
{"text":"I tried this place at the Phoenix airport. I ordered the chicken fajita rice bowl. The server was nice but he was frazzled since there was a long line. I didn't like how the price on the menu was around $6 but my bowl rang up as $7.99. By the time I noticed, it was too late. They really need to work on the discrepancy and either update their menu pricing or stop overcharging customers. The chicken bowl was a decent size but the chicken was WAY too salty. The rice and veggies were good and had tons a flavor. Overall, a semi-decent place to grab food before a flight."}

{"text":"I have low expectations for airport food, but this place wasn't bad.  The breakfast burrito beat the other McChains in the terminal."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I know that this place is located in the airport, but airport food can be great - this was NOT!  This was my second time visiting the Blue Burrito Grille in the Phoenix airport. The first time I tried a chicken and rice bowl. The whole thing was very bland, and needed tons of hot sauce. I understand that a rice bowl doesn't always scream flavor, so I decided to give them another shot while in transit back home to San Diego.  I asked the girl at the register how the Blue Corn Soft Tacos were like, and if they were any good. She replied \" I don't know, haven't had it.\" Ok, maybe she's new. I ordered in anyway and got it with chicken. Once again, BLAND and tasteless. The lettuce was soggy, the cheese was stringy and the chicken had no flavor, not a fan. Even the side order of chips were stale and tasteless.  Not a fan, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Bland blah food. I had to smother my carnitas in hot sauce to make them edible. Do not recommend this place at all!"}
{"text":"Their food ROCKS. Great quality and their burritos are large."}
{"text":"Was connecting through PHX on 3/8 and had the Blue Corn Chicken Tacos. The chicken had the consistency and taste of an old leather shoe with the price of new Nike's. Would not recommend, but was the only choice at the time."}
{"text":"Blue Burrito - Quality Mexican food for a not-so-bad price.  My girlfriend and I both chose to have a choose 2 dinner, to get a good variety.  While the Taquitos and Street tacos were good, the Flautas and Steak taco shined!  The steak was perfectly cooked with a bit of char, and the Flautas, drenched in sour cream and guac were on point.  Throw in the $10 for $20 Yelp deal and this is a must visit.   ** Reason for 4 stars instead of 5:  the side rice could've been better.  It was rather dry and flavorless."}
{"text":"On a one hour layover to Fort Lauderdale My friends and I ordered 3 steak burritos and 3 small Redbulls. The total came to be around $45! For fast food airport food, I thought that was a bit over priced.   The food was prepared fast.   The burritos were kinda small, and the so called steak, should have been called shredded beef.  The taste of the burritos were good, and if I were in a rush to catch a plane, I would come back again."}
{"text":"I tried the Carne Asade and Diablo buritto. Definitely better than Taco Bell, but not outstanding.   I appreciate how they have complementary chips and salsa (and they try to keep the chips warms)."}
{"text":"This is a favorite lunch spot for me. You can customize the veggie burrito to be vegan and it's not bad. I would give the burrito itself 3 stars, but you get unlimited chips and salsa from the salsa bar for FREE and who doesn't love free unlimited chips and salsa?!  On a few occasions they have goofed up the order so vegans beware, more beans would be nice in the burrito but overall it's decent and something different compared to heading to Chipotle, Rubios or Baja Fresh (plus, these guys are local!).   They have a nice patio for when the weather is accomodating and enough staff and seating so that at lunch time service is always good and speedy. Give it a try."}
{"text":"This the best \"fast mexican food around\". The chicken machaca is so delicious!! It's good quality food for cheap prices that doesn't leave you feeling really gross after. I also like the chip and salsa bar. I've been coming here since I was a little kid, and it always had the same great flavor."}
{"text":"Went here recently with a family member who was back in town and used to go to BBG all the time.  I've been here plenty of times over the years, and I do have to say that it is sad to see the contraction that they have experienced...I remember when they had at least five locations in the Valley.   Based on their restaurant list, it does seem if they have found a niche in food court/airport type settings, so maybe that will work out better for them.  I got the chicken tacos in corn tortillas.  They were OK, nothing interesting, nothing bad about them.  Should have stuck with the usual, black bean and cheese burrito with steak or chicken...I'll know for next time.  A strong benefit of BBG is the unlimited free chips they have out, usually nice and fresh."}
{"text":"Airport pseudo Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great? No. A decent, reasonably priced burrito for an airport, and fast? Yes.  There's not that much to say about a place like this, other than if I was hungry in this airport terminal again, I'd probably be back.    The staff was both fast and friendly, given that they were busy.    They sell decent (non-alcoholic) drinks, including Naked Juice.  Probably the best thing on the menu is the Blue Burrito Super Burrito."}
{"text":"First visit yesterday- I ordered a burrito.  Whole wheat wrap, no lard black beans, steak asada, shredded cheese mix, lettuce, jalapeño slices, and sour cream.  $8 and change. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-burrito-grille-scottsdale-2#ejrnr7b_7ryVNTisxMGpvQ  Tiny wrap, since I had omitted many fillings, but delicious! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-burrito-grille-scottsdale-2?select=NDnyxZS0u-DfeOVDZyMVKQ#NDnyxZS0u-DfeOVDZyMVKQ  I'd like to return, but $8+ is a little pricey.  I'll have to make sure not to be/become hungry while at the mall..."}
{"text":"Met a good friend here for lunch.  The place is a nice little meeting spot.  The food was delicious.  I had the Chicken Taco Salad.  Price is reasonable and the staff was great."}
{"text":"Great chicken quesadilla.  Made with real chicken cooked right there.  Not from bag of pre-cooked chicken like most airport eateries. The mild salsa was made fresh and not from a jar."}
{"text":"Was delayed for an hour in the dinnertime, and Eric R. and I wanted a snack.  He sent me off to find something that would please both of us.  Well, he loves Mex food.  I see the Blue Burrito, and Peter A's burring (I mean purring) about its yumminess.  I ordered the big blue no sour cream with steak.  The prices are Chipotle-esque and the portions are slightly smaller, but it is tasty and INCLUDED GUACAMOLE!!! yesss!!  The menu had a new addition, the chicken torta - it had all the goods and jalepenos on it, so next time I am delayed in Terminal C I might get that (Eric R. does not like hot peppers besides moi)."}
{"text":"They should write a book about how to ruin a soft taco.  I didn't think it was possible.  The corn tortilla was raw, not sauteed or warmed up at all, and thus tasted like cardboard.  The whole thing was cold.  The only good thing was the rice, which was very tasty.    A woman at the table next to us warned us that her chicken taco was horrible.  So why didn't we listen?  We figured it was just the chicken, but we should have asked more."}
{"text":"typical mall faire, but not bad. Their food is on the spicer side which gave me heartburn. Probably will saving my Mexican cravings for some place else."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time in the Phoenix airport... I was looking for a burrito on the way to Minneapolis, and this fit the bill perfectly. I had their signature blue burrito, and everything tasted nice and fresh, including the tortilla. The only problem is that the person who filled my bag didn't put a napkin in... didn't realize it til I was sitting at my gate. Oh well."}
{"text":"Stopped here because it was close to my Real Estate school. Had the Big Blue with red sauce and I really enjoyed it.  The free Salsa bar with chips, easy-going atmosphere, lobby cleanliness and great service makes this a place I will recommend to friends."}
{"text":"We tried this for office lunch as a change from Chipotle, since the menu has some interesting options that Chipotle lacks (like fish!) and the dieter (not me) was impressed with the low calorie counts.  Next time, I'm going to suggest we all bond by getting root canals together.  Credit the low calorie counts to tiny portions, so figure your meal will cost the same as at Chipotle, but you'll get maybe 2/3 as much food.  The one counter clerk correctly noted that, since I was clutching a list of items, I was a captive customer. She did the obvious thing for corporate efficiency and kept me waiting (and waiting and waiting), then was snippy while taking the order (after having been sweet to the family ahead of me). She was even snippier to the person after me, so I guess it's not difficult to be inadequate to the glories that are the Blue Burrito.  The carnitas in the street tacos were dry and flavorless, so it's a good thing the portions were so small, as it would have been unkind to ask me to chew through more of that. Refried pinto beans tasted as if a box of black pepper had been spilled in the pot, but the rice was quite good. I can also summon mild enthusiasm for the chips, though the \"hot\" salsa also tasted more of black pepper than of jalapeno.  So if you're looking to pay $7-$10 a meal for small portions of mediocre (but varied!) food dished up at low speed in a mildly hostile but industrial-chic environment, this Blue Burrito will be your go-to lunch spot in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Marginal at best. Most any choice for a snack at the airport."}
{"text":"$17.50 for a serve yourself bean burrito, 2 flavorless fish tacos and 2 sodas. Too much for boring food and no waiter service."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Not bad for you.  Big chunks of chicken--good protein fix.  Not quite up to Chipotle's level but I'd do it again...nothing is as portable as a burrito!  The perfect airport food."}
{"text":"I had a lay-over at Phoenix, AZ on my way to San Diego, CA (wierd lay-over right?!) and this joint caught my eyes.  I chose their Signature Big Blue Burrito with carne asada. Of course, since this place is inside the airport, pricing wise was expensive ($8). I think I was just really hungry when I landed so it tasted pretty good to me. It came with guacamole, sour cream, rice, beans, and cheese.  Overall, I think I had better burrito in the Bay Area for cheaper price."}
{"text":"Worst fajita chicken burrito I've ever had in life. The chicken was dry and flavorless, and the onions and bell peppers were slimy and mushy. Even adding Cholula hot sauce did not help it. Thank goodness the portion was small... I couldn't have been able to handle any more of it anyway."}
{"text":"Service Great - Rosemarie helpful in selecting drinks. Food great as well. Price reasonable."}
{"text":"So my flight was delayed and I was hungry.  Very hungry.  After walking around the airport looking for a Popeye's (because we saw a sign for it), we gave up and ended up at Blue Burrito.  I ordered a Big Blue Burrito - a double-size burrito with carne asada, rice, sour cream, guacamole, cheese and tomato.  It was good enough for me to keep eating even after spotting Donny Osmond at the same gate.  I also couldn't finish the whole burrito, so that will give some insight to its size.  Really nice lady working the counter, too."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant one day for lunch with the bf since I work at the hospital down the road, and oh it was worth it. I got the carnitas green chile burrito and my bf got the signature burrito with chicken. They were both good and the salsas were tasty (along with the all you can eat chips). I love the staff there, everyone was so warm and inviting. The people walking around clearing the tables were also polite, they even offered to refil our drinks even though it is a self serve kind of place. Based on service and quality of food, I give this establishment 5 stars! Will definitely return soon.  p.s. we could only eat half of our burritos, we took it home and ate it for dinner the next day, and it was really good (i added some sriracha or cholula to every bite!)."}
{"text":"Thought I'd be hanging in the CLOSED Delta Skyclub (Delta -reopen it!)  Two of us shared the Big Blue Burrito and Carnitas soft tacos - great way to enjoy both entrees!  Not a huge menu, but I'd eat here again!"}
{"text":"The girl at the register was nice enough but the kitchen behind her was in worrisome chaos. She called my order back about five or six times before anyone heard her, and even then the workers seemed more interested in jawing than in making my food. The food itself was undersized and bland, though with the salsa and Tapatio, it had a little flavor and heat."}
{"text":"I'm not crazy about the Blue Burrito Grill. I like that they have all you can eat chips and salsa. They are serve yourself and the salsa are good. I usually get the vegetarian burrito bowl and for some reason it always ends up watery and not very flavorful. I think Chipotle, Qdoba, and Fiesta Burrito are a lot better."}
{"text":"You think once you leave the strip the prices will go down...until you hit the airport!   2 Margaritas and a shared nachos $41 dollars. There wasn't even prices on the drink menu?  Good place to hangout though while delayed. Seat yourself...no one helps you even when its packed."}
{"text":"Okay, this isn't usually our first choice for quick Mexican food, but sometimes you don't want to feel so guilty after you eat a burrito. The Blue Burrito offers a healthier version of classic burritos. Although it isn't as good as Carolina's it is a good choice if you are trying at least a little bit to be somewhat healthier. Yeah, we would much rather scarf down a Bean and Cheese at Carolina's, but not being able to run the trails in AZ in the summer makes Blue Burrito our choice every now and then. Love the salsa bar, good salsa options with warm chips."}
{"text":"Checked this out last week and the chicken fajita burrito was actually ok based on my airport food standards (lower than regular food standards). I would look for other options if you have more time than I did."}
{"text":"A good mall burrito.  Would return if hanging at the mall and needed something quick."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of dining options in this area of the terminal so I went here. This place was okay but nothing special. I tried the pork bowl and the pork itself was lean and tender. The vegetables didn't seem too fresh and were also just okay. The rice was overflavored or overseasoned and tasted like one of those premade boxed rices. This place is alright for airport food I but I wouldn't go here otherwise."}
{"text":"I had the rice bowl with pork during a quick one hour layover. The pork was lean and had decent spice, the onions and peppers were fresh, and the rice was spicy and fresh. The meal came with hot thin tortillas and was a better meal than I expected from a food court stand in an airport. If you eat here though eat this in the airport not on the plane, your seatmates really don't want to smell a Mexican lunch on a cross country flight!"}
{"text":"Why bother reviewing? To warn my fellow Yelpers of course.   It was bland and unfortunately there is such a thing as a tasteless burrito. The salsa was boring as it was all heat and no flavor. The blue corn tortilla wrap they use tastes like recycled cardboard and the price was an added insult.   This was clearly a mistake in the culinary pantheon of airport layover meals.   Stay away. You may find more authentic Mexican at Chipotle."}
{"text":"For Mexican food this place isn't great but for airport food it did the job. I got delayed an hour on my flight so I stoped in for a beer and a bite. They have dos equis on tap which was nice. I ordered the fajita burrito which was ok no real flavor but again for airport food wasn't bad. If you are at the high c gates it's the best of your options."}
{"text":"I needed some breakfast...and I felt like having a breakfast burrito.  Deciding on the Blue Burrito (T4 near A22) , I wasn't too sure what to expect of my breakfast burrito with chorizzo.  All in all I was pleased that it tasted relatively authentic and didn't leave me regreting my decision later on my trip.  It filled me up and left me stuffed for several hours."}
{"text":"I was super disappointed with Blue Burrito.  I realize it is in the airport, but I thought that being in the southwest would get me something that could at least compete with Taco Bell.  Not the case.  The only upside was that it was pretty fast."}
{"text":"Simple and tasty. Big blue burrito was just what I needed."}
{"text":"Better than average fresh-Mex food.  I like their chips and salsa bar, but none of their salsas are phenomenal, just mediocre.  Their food is kinda bland and lacks flavor and their plates are a little on the small side..... not enough beans / rice.  Their prices are decent.  If you're thinking Chipotle or Rubio's or some crap like that, you'd be better off here, but that's not saying much."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! Sick for 6 days compliments of Blue Burrito (PHX terminal 3) egg burrito. Shared this contaminated food with my husband who too is finally recovering.  Outfits like this get away with dirty food all the time.  People passing thru only to become sick after leaving PHX!  Read reviews.  One poor guy ate there before leaving for Europe.  Sick for 4 days.  Beware!"}
{"text":"Ummm, can I have a little Mexican food with my salt?   Holy crap! This food is over salted and waaaaaay over seasoned. I went here and ordered a veggie bowl thingy and I did not like it at all. The peppers and onions (fajitas) were way over cooked and tasted like they were sitting there all day. The guac was bland and over salted, and the lettuce wasn't crunchy. The food was luke warm and really not impressive at all.   I will say, their chips are really good. Maybe get nachos or something?"}
{"text":"For some reason, I pictured that when ordering a 'Blue Burrito' it would come in a blue corn tortilla.  But it didn't.  (Maybe it used to but Godzilla-sized crows have decimated the blue corn supply? An upset in the food supply as blue corn farmers switch to growing the oh-so-popular quinoa?)    I had the signature Blue Burrito made without meat and without cheese (on that veggie kick again) and it was pretty marginal. Just your usual black bean, rice, salsa affair that was unfortunately tasteless.  The guacamole tasted exceptionally over-mayoed.  Being from Southern California, I always have high expectations for Mexican fare and am routinely disappointed when I'm not dining in my hometown.  Also, I had a little heartache over the fact this puppy set me back $9.39.  Not a great way to begin a 2-hour layover."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of burritos, especially the \"garbage\" variety of mixed meat, rice, beans, sauce and salsa that I remember from living in Los Angeles and Southern California. They were super big and super tasty.  Not so at Blue Burrito.  My burrito was barely edible.  A Taco Bell Cantina Chicken Bowl is better tasting than this and it's a far cry from a burrito at Chipotle.  The service was pretty quick but for some reason they were out of chicken, so thanks, no thanks I'll skip Blue Burrito next time.  Would have been slightly better if I could have gotten the sauce packets opened.  Maybe it wouldn't have tasted too salty and on the bland side.  There must have been a thimbleful of guacamole on my burrito as I couldn't taste it at all.  The flavors never mixed or fused into anything enjoyable.  What was imagined as a healthier alternative to airport food was pretty disappointing and resulting in my drinking a lot on the plane to get the salty taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"The best breakfast burrito I've ever had. My mouth is still tingling with delight and heat as I type this. Really just happened to be waiting for my flight and did not quite want a breakfast I could get back at home.... aka a Wendys breakfast.  The Blue Burrito Grill was right across the way.  I had their \"works\" breakfast burrito which features freshly seared chorizo, scrambled eggs, and potatoes. It came with a small plastic container of hot sauce which went perfectly with the burrito.  This is a quick stop and run type place without any seating. They do have a bar height table to stand at and stuff your face."}
