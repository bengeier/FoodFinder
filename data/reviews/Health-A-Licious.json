{"text":"This is probably my favorite food truck! It is healthy and delicious. It is so true to their name. I can't? wait to eat there again. I had the chicken salad which was awesome. The chicken was grilled to perfection and the dressing was so so so good! My husband got the taco salad. I tasted the chili and I wanted his salad too. The kids got the chicken wraps and it had colorful vegetables. I can't wait until next time!"}
{"text":"Had them booked for our School District today and they did not show. Tried calling them and their phone is not taking messages. If you are depending on a truck to arrive as they promise, this might not be your best bet."}
{"text":"Just had the best salad of my life, with amazing bbq ranch dressing, super tender and juicy chicken, corn and black beans, and fresh mixed greens (no janky sad lettuce) The person who served me owns the truck, and she couldn't have been nicer. My coworkers also love the loaded fries, but I haven't tried them yet. Don't sleep on health-a-licious!"}
