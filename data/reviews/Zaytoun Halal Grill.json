{"text":"I was excited to try this place as I had heard good things about it. The restaurant was smaller than I had expected, I came on a weekday so it was pretty empty though. I tried the burger with yam fries. I normally love yam fries, but these were not crispy enough for my liking. The burger was okay, the sauce on it was good but the patty itself tasted like something I could barbecue for myself at home. Probably wouldn't order it again, but the rest of the menu looked promising & I'll definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Great food , awesome atmosphere and their homemade hot sauce is awesome! Too bad they're closed Tuesdays but well worth the trip to mississauga!"}
{"text":"The food was really good.   The place just happened to be empty when I went.  My food arrived quickly. Service was attentive and prompt. Food was delicious."}
{"text":"Passed by this restaurant several times in the past. Finally decided to tryout. Nice decor with modern and Arabesque paintings. Menus is mixed Arabic and Mediterranean. It attracts the Muslim foodies looking for Halal meats and cooking. While they provided napkins embroidered with their logo. No one cared to light the candles already placed on each table. Service was spotty. No side plates were provided for sharing the appetizers. Bottles of Perrier were left unopened and we had to ask for lemon wedges. We ordered Humus and mini cheese burgers. The burgers were tasty though the mini buns were non attractive.  Humus was the worst we ever had even if compared to the one served at Paramount, Jerusalem, and Tabbouleh in Toronto. We returned the bulk of it when the mains were brought. For the mains we ordered Fillet Mignon and Red Snapper.  My wife liked the taste and tenderness of Fillet. It was a mixed plate of steaks with a piece of Fillet sitting on other cuts of meats. Quite an intriguing way of serving a Fillet Mignon. The server was proud to show us that he was sending the order to the kitchen on an IPhone type device. But when he brought the food he did not know as to who asked for what. My fish was OK, like standard fare at any nearby restaurants, and there is plenty of competition for similar food. There are various steakhouses and Mediterranean places just down the street.  Zaytoun is purely catering to Muslim customers in search of Halal food. There is a very large Muslim population in the vicinity, though many may not come here since it may be considered a pricey joint. We may go there with my sons just to get a second opinion on steaks. We have had steaks at Morton's,  Barbarian, Ruth Chris, Keg, and recently at Cafe Boulud. Though Zaytoun is serving Halal I would like to see that they are following the basics of Steak  cuisine. Our evening was saved after the spotty service and OK food since the server removed the horrible Humus from the bill. We also in return added the traditional tip. If they improved on the small touches on service I may add another half star to the 3. I am not sure if Alcohol is served there. Seems not due the need of attracting Hall food customers."}
{"text":"we drove around trying to find the place, there is some construction in the area so access to the restaurant was kind of tricky.   So we finally found the restaurant, and quickly went into the parking lot access to the restaurant is only marked through the main street and it leaves you wondering where to park and where to go after parking.   we finally in the restaurant, had to wait to get someone's attention to be seated. Restaurant is nicely done and very clean.  Menu is also kind of misleading, is it mediterranean? is it Italian?   I ordered Pesto Salmon, wife ordered Chicked with Penne Pasta and kid ordered chicken parmesan.  let me start with the good. Chicken parm was spot on and was tasty. Chicken with penne pasta was spicy but had a flavour of indian spices, there were two different size of penne pastas that lead me to believe that they had two different kind of pastas left over and dish was creation of those two. Pasta was also tough and oily.  My Pesto salmon also was very minty and soupy, i thought pesto is suppose to be thick, i do not believe i got my money's worth.   From decor and cleanliness restaurant is nice however food is a miss, as far with what we ordered and needs some work."}
{"text":"This place is really what I have been searching for! I went there on a Wednesday night, and so it was not very busy and we had the undivided attention of the waitress (who was absolutely fabulous - gave suggestions, was friendly). This is why I cannot comment on the service on busier days.   However, what I can comment on is the food, which was absolutely delicious! We went as a group of 8 people and so I got to taste a bunch of different dishes. The Chicken Oscar was my least favourite but it was still tasty. The Chicken Mediterranean, Chicken Parm were great! But the stars of the show had to be the Filet Mignon and the Philly Cheese Steak! They were so juicy and flavourful!  For dessert we got the tiramisu, which was very good -- but it was heavy and I would not recommend it after such a hearty meal.  I will definitely be going back!"}
