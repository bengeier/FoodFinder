{"text":"I love this place. I've been about four times and there hasn't been a night I didn't enjoy. The most recent show I went to was a comedian from Wild n Out. Hilarious. The set up is fine. Staff is friendly. I don't think they typically have food/drink specials (on weekends anyways), but the prices aren't too bad. If you're having trouble finding the building..go down the ramp you'd use to get to Label, or you can go in through Wet Willies and head to the back."}
{"text":"This is a great place to see some hilarious improv comedy performed by some of Charlotte's most talented and funny people !"}
{"text":"I took classes from Keli here at CCT . She did such wonders on me I moved to Chicago to continue my training and no I am huge here! Ok, only kidding. But if you want an amazing teacher who knows the best in the biz then take from Keli. She can break you out of your shell and keep your mind flowing. The theater is small but it is all she really needs for know. She is worth the price and I did it for 18 weeks and loved it. Thanks Keli."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were visiting Charlotte for about a week from Los Angeles, and I can say that the comics we saw at the 10pm explicit show on a Friday Night were more entertaining than the comics we had to pay twice as much to see in LA a month or so earlier. 

Some of the comics were a little nervous, but none of them totally bombed, and most of them were really great, had original hilarious jokes, and kept the night moving along with laughs. 

We only paid $10 each, and laughed more than we would at some silly Judd Apatow movie, so I'd say if you're looking for something to do in Charlotte, check this place out. 

It's also in a very cool part of town, with lots of good bars to check out, so make a night of it. We did, and had a great time.  (It's hidden in a bar called THE NOOK)"}
{"text":"Best improv in Charlotte.
Very talented actors that can go blue, but keep it mostly above the belt.  Just $10 and you're already in NoDa and ready for a wonderful Fri or Sat."}
{"text":"I left this place place in tears a soar jaw and stomach pain. Not from being beaten up but from the laughing so hard. Improv comedy at its finest .found this place while looking for something to do while on vacation. $10 per person and al the laughs you can handle. Very interactive and a lot of fun. If I come back to Charlotte I will go back."}
{"text":"Nice venue, comfortable seats.  It was funny, not side splitting. There were more \"games\" that the group did, and not a lot based in audience suggestion. I would have appreciated the \"improv\" more if there was more of it. Much of what was done could have easily been performed previously and passed off as \"improv\". 
It was nice to experience something different, and it is good to see more options for entertainment in Charlotte."}
{"text":"If you've ever been curious about learning improv - or would like to try something fun and unique - join a six-week class with Keli Semelsberger, executive director of Charlotte Comedy Theater. 

Inspirational, outrageous, hilarious, and spiritual, Keli teaches the gifts of improv that can be really useful in \"real\" life as well. 

And the shows on Friday and Saturday nights are super casual and tremendously fun. It's like hanging out with all your funniest friends for the night. (And the cover is only $10.)"}
{"text":"Still a 5! 

Went to see the Improv group this weekend in their new location - the back room of Wet Willies. The new venue is a wayyyy better. Cover is still $10 per person (you can make reservations, but you can also just show up). 

Now they have waiter service - you can order any drinks or food from Wet Willies and they bring it right to you. I'm not saying the food is stellar, but at least there's the option if laughing gives you the munchies. The seating is also better, lots of comfy leather couches and small tables. 

Big improvement from their old venue. Shows are Fri/Sat night at 8 at Wet Willies and Sunday they have a family-friendly version at Comedy Zone. Something fun to do on the weekend!"}
{"text":"More people need to know about this! $10 is a steal for a fun Saturday night in Noda

This is an improv-style show and is put on by some great comedians The show changes based on audience suggestions and is truly hilarious. The show is R rated but not bad enough to where I felt uncomfortable bringing family...but use your best judgement. The show runs from 8-9:30 every Saturday - reservations are suggested but not mandatory. 

Venue was rustic, small and actually pretty cool! The bartender was serving up drinks at a reasonable $3-4 price and he wasn't too shabby to look at haha. He brought my dad some chocolate to go with the Guinness which I thought was a nice touch. One thing to note was that everything including bar was cash only. 

I'll be back with friends for sure!"}
{"text":"Great venue. Leather couches for a comfortable night of laughs. Bar service during the show. Different shows each week. Located in the back room of Wet Willies."}
{"text":"I was on a trip to Charlotte, NC and this comedy theater came up as highly recommended on Yelp as well as a few other sites. It's located in the back room of Wet Willies which is great because you can get liquored up at a reasonable price and bring your drinks with you into the comedy theater. You can also order food when you enter the theater; however, due to the setup of big comfy couches with only a few side tables interspersed, I don't know that it would be very easy to eat in the room. Tickets are only $10. 

I went to the Saturday night late show and had a blast. There were only eight of us in the room and while I do think it would have been more fun if there were more people, it was still very entertaining and lively. There were two girls in the back and I think they might have been friends with the comedy troupe because they were really trying to keep the energy level up with the small audience. So, for example, if one of the comedians was looking for an improv suggestion and no one spoke up immediately, they would shout out an answer to keep things going. I think they might have been planted there to do just that but it was fine and it did help with the small group.

The comedians themselves were hilarious, professional, and had a great range of personalities. On this particular night there were a few guest comedians visiting from another city and it was really interesting to see how well everyone worked together. During my show, there was one person who was acting as the host and then everyone else was playing predetermined games with details suggested by the audience. It was very \"whose line is it anyway\". The subject matter ranged from G to MA. I think the late show is a bit more adult than the early show.  

For $10 a ticket, you will really get your moneys worth with this show. The comedians are diverse and very funny and all seem to enjoy working with each other. The theater is all the way at the back of Wet Willies and you'll pay for your tickets at the theater door. You can reserve tickets in advance but I didn't get the feeling that this was necessary.

My last note is about the general North Carolina Music Factory area that this is located in. When we first arrived, we were there early to grab dinner at an Italian restaurant near Wet Willies. At that time it was tame but still lively with people in their late 20s and up enjoying drinks and dinner. By the time we left the comedy theater after 12 the place was teeming with 18-early 20 year olds in club gear, all of which seemed drunk and angry. The whole vibe sketched me out and I'm from Atlanta so that is saying something. The good news is that there is plentiful free parking so it was quick to find parking when we arrived and quick to hightail it out of there when we left. There is also valet parking available right at the entrance to Wet Willies. This wouldn't deter me from going back to the comedy theater, but I wouldn't plan to spend the rest of my evening there."}
{"text":"Awesome! I've never heard of this place before, and we found it through Yelp! It's a small place to sit and watch, but the personalities are not small at all! The improv group was hilarious, a little crude, a little rude, but all funny. I would totally recommend it, grab a drink at Wet Willies and some fries and enjoy the show. For the improv group, it was $10 cash. You can reserve a spot online, and I did (just to see if it were necessary). It wasn't reaaaally necessary. But if you have a big group, I would reserve your spot online so you can get a comfy couch.

It's in the back of Wet Willies, NOT the Comedy Zone. It was a little confusing when we got there."}
{"text":"I love comedy, but never knew this place existed for some reason. They get under the radar comics here, but they usually aren't under quality. 

The place smells a little bit funny, but you stop noticing it after a few minutes. You sit at regular restaurant tables and get waiter service, which is nice, so you don't have to go to a concession stand and grab a drink during the show. 


You will laugh a lot and have a good night out for a pretty reasonable price."}
{"text":"I recently relocated from Los Angeles and a new friend of ours invited us out to see him perform at the Charlotte Comedy Theatre.  I wasn't expecting much, after all it was a free comedy show, in an obscure location (the back hallway of the Graduate on the corner of Plaza and Central) and I am used to \"Hollywood -caliber\" improv shows, like those at the Groundlings on Melrose Ave.

We grabbed a bucket of beer and headed down the hallway that said \"Restrooms,\" then into the tiny theater with makeshift seating and a simple stage.  I started fast on my beers, a strategy intended for enduring what I anticipated would be a lukewarm performance.

Much to my surprise, the Charlotte Comedy Theatre was a breath of fresh air, a sign that Charlotte has more than a pulse, it has a soul.  And I mean this with no disrespect, but as a growing city, looking to be more cosmopolitan than southern, Charlotte needs more culture and more entertainment; Charlotte Comedy Theater serves up both.

A friendly MC warmed up the crowd and they started with a Du-rap-rap, improv rap sequence, with the entire cast, who took turns rapping a comedic rhyme based on a name with a single syllable.  As cheesy as this may sound, it was quite enjoyable and funny.

The rest of the evening, different pairs of cast members did a variety of improv exercises, involving suggestions from the audience (which unsurprisingly veered toward the R-rated).  There were moments of brilliance, hilarity and sometimes even genius.  

What stood out to me was the raw joy that each performer had in what they delivered.  Absent was the smug conceit and what we saw was a a special combination of talent, chemistry and spontaneity. 

The cast as a whole was pretty good, but there were a handful of standout performers, which I will attempt to remember.  

JAMES (a bald, black guy): Wickedly funny; he gets lost into the characters and is a thrill to watch.  MIKE (a guy with brown hair and glasses): Sharp, left field in his improv style, with the kind of humor of a \"still waters run deep\" sort of way. ANDY (bald white guy): His best moments were during physical comedy situations (the ostrich farm and kung fu sequence). A YOUNG NEWCOMER, male, lean, curly hair: this one showed real potential, unassuming in appearance and stage presence, he sneaks up on you with some deadly funny lines.

You must check this crew out. So far, this has proven to be the best thing I've discovered in Charlotte.  For $10, you can't beat it."}
