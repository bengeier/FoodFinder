{"text":"Brunch service is great here. You'll be greeted with complimentary orange juice shooters and a chic rectangular basket of muffins, sweet bread, and mini crossants with jam and nutella. Then you can choose from a fresh one-page menu of Italain inspired breakfast staples. I've tried the Veggie Frittata and Eggs Benedict. Mostly all of the plates come with sides of fresh fruit, etc. You will be served real coffee here. This is not Eggspectation or some other Breakfast Juggernaut . The expresso is quality and you can rely on it, because it's an Italian Cafe afterall. Warning: this is not a walk-in resto. I've seen a lot of people turned down here. You must absolutely make a reservation ahead of time, because this charming little cafe is barely a 50 seater. Futhermore, make sure you know who takes your reservation, because sometimes, anyone will answer the phone, and your reservation will be lost. It happened to me once and they totally made up for it (big time) with amazing service and comlimentary Lattes! So like I said, this is not a quiet place to sit back and read your newspaper for brunch- it's packed with jovial customers and a frantic waitstaff , which make it fun. But maybe not for everybody.  Speaking of fun: Dinner can be romantic here too- yet, pleasantly laid back and casual. They offer a fresh, compact menu with classic Italian dishes. They do a tasty shrimp risotto and the cheese risotto that comes with the (average) Oscobuco is really tasty too. Although the food is fresh, the execution of dinner is only slightly above avergage (in general) for this type of cuisine. But the prices are fair, the Tiramisu for dessert is excellent and they have some tasty wines. I recommend the 2010 Saladini Pilanstri, DOC Falerio. It doesn't say Bio-wine on the menu, only on the bottle, so ask for it by name, because the waiters typically don't know much about the wine. Also, I hope you don't have the bad luck of getting the stinky B.O. waiter that hasn't washed his wavey ponytail hair in a month. Fingers crossed. 3 stars for dinner service.  So, the risk in choosing this resto is that it can be very unconsistent at 2 stars or a solid 4 star experience; which is a big range to consider."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner. I like the restaurant, but couldn't say too much about their food.  I would suggest getting the daily/weekly specials, I think they are worth it in terms of freshness and quality.  I would like to go back here and try out their brunch, but I am not dying to do so immediately since it is a bit pricier.  I had the eggplant appetizer and cod sicilian style -- and neither was amazing.  Someone else got the soup of the day and the special -- house gnocchi with gorgonzola -- and they were both really good.  The tiramisu tasted authentic and delicious.  I spoke briefly to the chef, a lovely Sicilian woman who doesn't speak too much english/french, but is delighted to talk to you.  My waiter, who spoke perfect Italian, was actually Cuban, and was a great host."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in Montreal. You need a reservation for Saturday/Sunday brunch. For Montreal that says a lot.  Before you order they bring you a tray full of very very good Sicilian pastries, coffee and a glass of juice. Included.   Food is incredible. I love their eggs benedict and florentine. Did not like their shrimp omellette, but tastes differ. It was well done, not my food though.   Highly recommended."}
