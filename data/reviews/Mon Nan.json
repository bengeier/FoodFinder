{"text":"Found this place open late at night and we were so lucky. So much food for little money and the taste was good too, there's definitely tons of variety, I'll definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Pekin Duck is excellent."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was awesome.  We ordered incorrectly.  Other meals that arrived to other tables looked spectacular/people's reactions were great.  We enjoyed our time there however- mostly due to the previously mentioned \"long eyebrow waiter\".  Who was a total helpful sweetheart.  I am a person who has worked with large groups of Chinese people and I think that the person who thought the \"long eyebrow waiter\" was mean did not know how it works.  To us we thought he was super nice.  Late night post drinking Chinese total recommend."}
{"text":"From the fresh wonton soup, spicy shrimp soup to the Crispy duck (not fatty), Beef and broccoli, sauteed vegetables and tofu,the food was fresh and well prepared. Our waiter was attentive and helpful. The place was clean, food well priced and service very good. we will certainly return as there were many dishes we want to try."}
{"text":"Commonly known as the best Pekin duck in mtl  (according to my chinese friends)  This restaurant used to be on Clark second floor, across from maison VIP, but now it's moved to la gauchetiere and st-dominique, first floor.  If you come here you have to get the Pekin duck, it's their best dish bar none. My only complaint is you never seem to get enough pancakes, and when you order more it takes a long time to come... Pekin duck is a 3 dish affair, they use the whole duck. Comes with soup first from the bones, then it's the Pekin duck with pancakes sauce and pickled carrots and dicon radish. Lastly chop suey with duck meat, you can ask them to turn this dish into a noodle dish for an extra charge.  The salt baked squid is quite good, good saltiness and mildly crispy and soft inside.   The mongolian beef here is decent except it's just too sweet...  sweet and sour pork here is just average, nothing to crow about. It's one of my favorite dishes eventhough according to my chinese friends it's not authentic chinese but more north american chinese...  Whatever one of them told me general tao's was not a real sichuan dish... low and behold i went to China no less and found it on their menu... turns out it's a real sichuan dish except they use sichuan peppercorn in china but not here, something to do with customs and peppercorn pest infestation... so there's variations in north american and chinese versions of dishes...  All in all, it's just like all the chinese restaurants in chinatown MTL, they're all about same same, except they make one dish better that anyone else, and this one has the best Pekin duck."}
{"text":"I went there with some friends after a badminton session. Super hungry! First, they assigned us to a table which was in the middle of the restaurant.  The waiter tripped on my sport bag, got mad and asked us to move near the aquarium.  Building tension already, which was bad for us.  We ordered chef's specialty: Beef stew, pork belly, mongolian beef, sizzling chicken.  They serve us chicken/ vegetables soup and tea for free, which was great.  Amazing quality food. I felt in love with the beef stew. Such tender meat.  Quality is excellent. Price range for each dish was around 13-15$. Very very very rude owner or waiter with unusual long eyebrow. We came in the front to pay. He didn't pay attention to us until we make a sign.  Then, we asked the bills to be split. He played with his calculator and add 15-20%+ tips on our bill. Look at us like we were shiet.  Despite this horrible person. Good quality food.   Good after party place as it open from 11am to 4am. Overall, good place for the food. Beware of the long eyebrow man. haha"}
{"text":"Cheap, greasy, but delicious Chinese food.  Best dish: salt and pepper sea food. It's amazing."}
{"text":"When you ask for traditional Peking duck, they offer you two options: deep fried (called crispy with veggies) duck or BBQ duck. Neither of which are actual Peking duck. I went with the first option, the meat was dry and bland. The skin soaked in batter and oil. The dish was served on translucent thickened up frying oil with no flavor."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Do NOT order the Pekin or Beijing roasted Duck; dry, old, expensive and taste nothing like the real thing. There is a restaurant near Guy Concordia which serves authentic beijing roasted duck (larger quantity, tastier, and cheaper!!!). What an embarrassment to the dish.  Most of the tables were occupied by non-chinese people, which is a clear indicator that chinese people don't go to this restaurant. If chinese people don't go to the restaurant, it is likely that the food is not good and really expensive. And that is exactly the case.  Yes, the restaurant appears cleaner than other restaurants in Chinatown, but unless you want to waste your money on tasteless and expensive food, choose any other restaurant in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Great service! Supper cheap for awesome food with huge portions!!! I really wanna give 5stars altho the server was dismissive, which was alright i guess because we had two other servers at our table..was confusing to some extent. But wtv the food was there as we had ordered and i left wanting to plan my next return lol numnumnumnum!"}
{"text":"Habituellement j'y vais à 3h du matin avec mes amis, mais les gens avec qui j'étais l'autre soir voulaient y aller pour le souper. C'est un des seuls restos Chinois auxquels je mange dans le Chinatown et c'est un de mes préférés. Tout ce que nous avons commandé était superb, surtout les dumplings au porc frits dans la poêle (pan-fried). Je n'étais pas capable de trouver la soupe won ton aux crevettes (et non au porc) sur le menu alors je l'ai mentionné au serveur et il nous a arrangé ça :) Le seul hic ici c'est les prix ; ça nous a quand même coûté assez cher pour 5 plats et un litre de vin blanc maison (que je ne recommande vraiment pas, ça goûtait les fleurs)."}
{"text":"Okay so... The older bald guy who escorted me and my BF to our seats was just unpleasant aswell as unhelpful when it came to ordering. Then when our food came and I had ordered chow mein which I always order and it's stir fried noodles.... I even googled. Their chow mein came as just a plate of chop sewy and chicken... The waiter or whoever he is told me I'm wrong and that chow mein is not noodles!!!! He seemed more concerned about poker or whatever was going on in their \"sketchy\" basement. As for our food, he wouldn't do anything about that. Not to mention the food tasted like stuff you can get at all u can eat buffets like \"fu lam\" ! I don't understand how this place has good reviews.... I recommend this place to people who are stoned or drunk at 3am with no other places to go haha"}
{"text":"I've been going here since the mid-eighties.   Food and service have ranged from okay to outstanding over the years, but they've never served me anything resembling a bad plate, and they have never screwed up my order.  Our waiter and busboy this past Sunday evening were really on the job, and the food was just what the doctor ordered.  The pan-fried dumplings and the Chinese broccoli in garlic sauce were standouts, and the Cantonese chow mein and beef with two kinds of mushrooms weren't disappointing.  Perfect rice and drinkable tea completed the order.  We ate all the bits of it.  Restroom was usable without gagging.  That's not always been the case.  Despite its austere decor and lighting, and cyclically unpleasant loos, this place remains my go-to Chinese spot in Montreal.  Why?  Because it's been a consistently reliable spur-of-the-moment choice for deeply-flavored, stick-to-the-ribs westernised Cantonese cuisine for 25-odd years.  Just the ticket to raise one's spirits in the pit of a Montreal winter.   I'm happy just knowing it's open, some days."}
{"text":"Nul besoin de se déplacer jusque dans chinatown pour se gaver de cette pitance infâme et sans âme au parfum industriel. Un simple arrêt à la cantine de l'hôpital le plus proche suffira."}
{"text":"Mon Nan has a cozy, late night atmosphere with their diffused LED wall lighting that gradually changes colour every few minutes.  You'll notice a fish tank and a lobster tank by the entrance, so you know the lobster is as fresh as it gets.  That said, for some reason we ordered beef, shrimp and duck. The duck was a greasy mess, not crispy as advertised. The shrimp was similarly lacklustre. If there's one thing these guys do well, though, it's beef. We enjoyed both the broccoli beef and BBQ beef ribs and were satisfied with both.  The service is typical of a Chinese restaurant; nothing fancy, and personally that's how I like it. Tea is on the house as you might expect.  What you can't beat is their schedule, they're open until 4AM, so it's perfect for those late night cravings.  Overall I was satisfied. I still have to get to know their menu to figure out what else they're good at, but I do intend to return. Probably in the wee hours of the night with my boys, ordering the wrong thing."}
{"text":"What a great meal that my wife and I just had. Both entrees were 5 star great.  She had the Chicken with Cashews and I the Gen Tso Shrimp.   Have had Chinese food all over the Globe (China twice on big tours) and Europe - this was the best hands down.   Makes me bumbed that we don't live anywhere near (from PA/USA)"}
{"text":"I was on the hunt for Peking Duck in Chinatown. The first time I tried it was in Chicago - we had 5 courses and I was completely fascinated how every part of the duck is salvaged into a different Meal- literally nothing is wasted!  I walked into Mon Nan with no expectations- since I've never had it in Montreal. Recommended by a friend - this place was in the 2nd floor. Chinatown standard white plastic table cloths, scattered utensils on the table, sides of ketchup, soya sauce. The menu had a lot of choices but we had one thing in mind -peking duck! 25$ for half for 50$ for the whole duck served in 3 dishes:   1- tofu based soup- broth was excellent, perfectly salted and seasoned, with chunks of fresh tofu and, shallots and cooked duck.  2-5 crepes, duck with sides of pickled radish and carrots, shallots and a chutney type sauce (looked like siracha mixed with hoison sauce - not spicy) these were by far my favourite. Down side- where I take away a couple of stars - hair in my pickled radish - I was grossed out. They replaced it brand new - but hygiene is a big factor for me. Hair equals gross.  3-duck chow mein with crispy noodles-nothing special about this dish. Tasted like regular take out.  I like that the duck did not smell, and was thorough cooked. Considering we ordered a half portion, our server did not cut it in front of us - which is the most entertaining part of having peking duck!  Dessert - complimentary orange slices and fortune cookies.   Steady good meal minus the hair!"}
{"text":"Really not much to brag about, only advantage is the long hours and nice decor for Chinatown.  I got 2 dishes to go.  Mongolian Beef was insanely sour with barely any veggies a steep $15. The duck was a bit better, but lacked much seasoning (just 5-6 chunks) (more reasonable $10)  The service was very direct, barely giving me time to order or look at the menu, much less ask questions. Food was suspiciously prepared in less than 5 minutes, and the result was what felt like re-heated food."}
{"text":"Vous êtes tanné de manger du Mcdo, de la poutine, des pointes de pizzas un peu passer date après le club ou bar? Pas de problème, le Mon Nan est ouvert jusqu'à 4h (comme plusieurs restos du quartier chinois)   C'est succulant. C'est bon! C'est cochon. Je vous conseille le riz frit, général tao, chow mein, homard fruit de mer sel et poivre et les baby ribs au veau...UN DÉLICE...ET pas cher quand on y vas en groupe! On s'entend que la qualité du service n'est pas excellente, ni les supers nappes blanches en plastique, mais on oublie vite ce détail quand on y mange."}
{"text":"They just renovated so It now looks like a W Hotel Lobby, but same mostly asian clientele and still great food.!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here after the imax cinema with a couple friends as my friend told me her friend loves it here!  We found it at the end of a street that was Doing some construction work but once we hit the corner you can see the lights changing colors in the room from the outside window and with a large crowd eating we knew it was gonna be great.  Sat down and had a pitcher of water and tea brought to us which was well needed after the walk in the rain to find this place.  There is a million options so I would suggest going with a big group because you can't finish it all. We chose peanut butter dumplings which were fantastic and spring rolls were really fresh and home made. Salt and pepper shrimp are probably the best I've ever had you must try.  Nice location I for sure will be back and try some more authentic items next time."}
{"text":"Food was decent I gotta admit, but the service was beyond horrible. After we ate, my friend went to the cash counter to ask for the bill. One of the waiter gave him the bill of another table, and my friend realized that so he told him it wasnt what we ordered. Then, he started to scream on my friend for \"being complicated\" and \"those bills are similar in terms of cost so just pay up\". After we refused, he finally gave us the right bill, so we left after paying. Ive never seen someone that angry in a restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is known for opening after regular restaurant hours from like 10pm until 4am on the weekends. I especially love the way they do the stir fried lobster with ginger. Also it's the only place in Chinatown that still serves snail in  black bean sauce."}
{"text":"I was in downtown on a Monday at 3am, quite hungry at that moment. Looked for a Chinese place and saw that this one was open until 4am, cool. Decided to go there, quite modern. One of the waiters was pushing me to order before the kitchen closes, showing a very grumpy attitude with his Chinese accent, so I asked what would he suggest, and he was even more rude \"I don't know you, I don't know what you like, read the menu \", hahahahhaa, that was hilarious, an stereotypical Chinese man giving me hard time, it was so funny, it adds it to the whole kind of underground experience at 3:30am. Additionally you would see entering all these amazing hot babes that I'm pretty sure worked at strip bars because of their make ups and super tiny dresses at 3:30am on monday.   Being pushed by the old man, I kind of picked the first thing I saw on the menu. See attached picture, I didn't like it that much because I feel it lacked more meat. But that was only my bad choice, cuz I saw other people's plate and they looked delicious. So I'm pretty sure I will come back any other time I will be partying downtown. But yet, cannot complain, it was a good dish."}
{"text":"This is one of the favourites of the actual people who live in Chinatown. A nice relaxing place with great food, a nice wine selection, and drinks."}
{"text":"I've been coming here with my family since I was a kid and it's probably one of my favorite Chinese restaurants to date. In terms of what they offer, it's pretty standard but the quality is high."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my parents and some out of town guests.  It was my first time in this restaurant. My parents normally order \"x course meals\" (replace x with a number) as opposed to ordering \"a la carte\" and this restaurant didn't really advertise their \"x course meals\". These meals generally come with a soup, a vegetable dish, a few seafood dishes, a chicken dish, a lobster dish, rice, and a fish dish at a slightly lower price than ordering all the items separately.  My parents received a menu showing the \"a la carte\" options. When the waiter showed up to our table, he asked my parents if they would prefer one of the meals as opposed to ordering \"a la carte\" and my parents answered yes. He then outlined what was available.  We had the duck which were slices of duck on a plate with some wrap on another plate and some pickled slice vegetables/carrots (somewhat similar to coleslaw). It was like a make your own Asian/Chinese burrito. There were also some plates of sauce. Since I didn't order, I'm assuming that this was the Peking duck and it was my first time having/trying this. I guess it is popular in some parts of China but I'm more used to the Cantonese type of food so it was the first time for me trying this. I found it to be good.  We also had some lobster, some vegetable dishes, a pork dish, a mushroom dish, etc. They were all very good."}
{"text":"The most decent chinese food in mtl.  Best service.  This is the only chinese food we eat in mtl."}
{"text":"The food here isn't the cheapest u can find in montreal, but it's ur only option if ur looking for Chinese food late night. I thought everything we ordered tasted average. I'm from Toronto obviously I've had better Asian food. We ordered 3-4 things take away last time and the bill came up to be around $90. Very expensive for what we got and compared to other places. And we didn't even get seafood. Literally just stir fried noodles and fried rice, typical Chinese food dishes."}
{"text":"To my surprise, this Chinese restaurant is actually quite good. I usually am not a fan of Chinese food. Seriously, I dislike it very much which surprises everyone since I myself am Chinese. But this restaurant managed to make it enjoyable for one! It's not my first time going there, but I used to only enjoy the toothsome shark fin soup. This time, I also got to eat seafood that I liked very much, although the soup will always be my #1!"}
{"text":"The best late night Chinese food in the city. Open very late, recently renovated so very nice ambience. And the food, the late night standards are great - Salt and Pepper shrimps, Cantonese chow mein, Chinese Mushrooms and Chinese broccoli"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic spot for Chinese food, right in the heart of Chinatown. A nice ambience and friendly staff that work extra hard to make your dining experience fantastic.  We took the sweet sour soup, won ton soup and they were perfect. Then we had the peanut butter dumplings and these have to be my favourite thing in the menu.. So fresh so delicious. We then had some sweet and sour pork, and pineapple chicken, kimchi was nice and spicy ! Chicken friend rice is the best in town IMO and the fried squid is nice and delicate with a crispy batter.  The best thing about his is the price, 6 ppl ate a large amount of food for 130 dollars.  Only thing I wasn't crazy about was the duck we had, a little to fatty for my taste"}
{"text":"We ordered a 2-person meal plus a couple additional dishes for three people.   1. Hot and sour soup - I'm never a fan of hot and sour soup anyway, but this one was quite salty and rather spicy in my books.   2. Pork dumplings with peanut sauce - Delicious! The peanut sauce was thick enough and had a little spice, went very well with the boiled dumplings.   3. Spring rolls - Fresh and crispy.   4. Orange beef - The beef was too thin so when it was fried they became too crispy.   5. Shrimp with black bean sauce - Really good. The shrimp were large and not overcooked at all. The sauce was tasty and not too salty.   6. General tao's chicken - Sizeable pieces with just enough batter to make them satisfying but  not overly heavy, went well with the steamed rice.   7. Orange chicken - Same basic chicken and the sauce was good  8. Mixed vegetables - Really crispy mix of bok choy, broccoli and mushroom   9. Shanghai noodles with shrimp and chicken - The shrimp was also amazing in the noodles. Sauce was good and generally what you would expect from Shanghai noodles.   On the whole, I'd say that Mon Nan is hit or miss depending on the dish. I'd say their 'good' dishes (by Westernized Chinese food standards) consists of around 70% of their menu. The rest are just no good at all -- It's just about knowing what you like and sticking to those dishes."}
{"text":"I take it back. This place is fantastic. I think I just sucked at ordering last time. Long live Mon Nan!"}
{"text":"Exquisite Peking duck the way it's supposed to be served. Tasty dumplings and a relaxing ambience"}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love! I've been eating at this restaurant since i was a little tiny kid when they were on Clark street. Never been disappointed with the food. My personal favourite would definitely be the cantonese chow mein, the beef and black bean sauce, all the salt and pepper dishes and of course their steamed dumplings. The cantonese lobster and the ginger scallion lobster is to die for!!! Fast and efficient service! Not the ultimate service but it's what you would expect in China town! Whenever i crave Chinese food, bad or good weather, this is the place that i go to. Just writing this review makes my mouth water. Maybe for dinner tonight !"}
{"text":"If you are homesick for Asian food whether it is Cantonese, Szechuan or Thai this is the place to go. I assure you this is the real deal. No need for me to go into detail about how delicious the food is look at all the posted pictures and don't waste anymore time reading reviews. Eat at Mon nan now!"}
{"text":"I have been to mon nan many times, but last Saturday, the portions were much smaller than we were used to.  The waiter was also in attentive and left us hungry for what seemed to be a long time."}
