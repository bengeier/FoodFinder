{"text":"Very disappointed.  Considering the price was way too expensive, we expected much more in quality.  Service was not good nor bad.    Small burgers and serving size for fries was worse."}
{"text":"Great food but poor service. Limited supplies ruined my ability to receive what I wanted. Didnt have enough ice cream for the shakes, ran out of condiments, didn't have enough drinks and tables were dirty. Fix the service and then this place maybe has a chance. The food isn't enough to save this place."}
{"text":"I tried Hero Burger for the first time today. The location is a bit out of the way and I had not noticed it before. The 6oz burger was tasty, but I have had better though more expensive burgers in Brampton. I would rate it between 3 and 4 stars. Service was friendly. The ambience of this restaurant is minimal, so I am giving it 4 stars with a chance to up the rating later."}
{"text":"Eh, just ok. Their meat has a fresh taste to it, which is nice, but I also feel it lacks some taste somehow. I was here for a burger promo and found out the limit was only one burger per purchase. I wasn't too thrilled with that because the condition was small print in light grey off the white background which made it hard to find - purposefully I suspect. That might have more to do with the company than this location in particular however.

It took a bit too long for the food to come and it looked as though everyone working was family, with one of them not seemingly knowing what to do. In spite of the promo, it wasn't all that busy. I was with a couple others and we took our food to go.

Unfortunately they messed up on a couple of my toppings, but it was still ok. Really good fries however. The burger was enjoyable, though I don't think I'd be too motivated to come back and pay full price.

They have one of those pop machines where you're supposed to be able to choose between several dozen flavours (i.e. coke, cherry coke, vanilla coke, coke with lime, etc...), but virtually none of the flavour additions were available."}
{"text":"First time having a hero burger. Great food, excellent service, and nice place. My only criticism would be the very dirty high chairs (I wouldn't put any kid in those) and lack of change tables in the restrooms. I don't expect all restaurants to be family friendly, but with a kids menu and high chairs available, I expect they would like families to visit. Other than that I will return for sure!"}
{"text":"RIP OFF. This place is a cash grab. What a waste of money got a pile of fries that are okay and a dry burger for 12 and change. I would never go back here, I cant believe this is a chain store. I think they are the worst burger deal I have ever been too(beside FINN MCCOOLS)"}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service.

I haven't been to a Hero in a long time, so I decided to give this place a try since I was passing through.

I had a hero burger 4oz with white cheddar cheese, sauteed onions, portobello mushrooms, and hero sauce. Everything in the burger was absolutely delicious, except the bun itself was a little soggy for my liking. Considering I paid $12+ for the burger I somewhat wished the burger was actually a little drier on my hands.

A nice feature of this restaurant is their drinks stall. They have over 100 drinks available! How do they do that? They list the standard soft drinks available (coke, sprite, etc), but then you get options to add different flavours to your drink (such as grape, orange, etc). I found that quite neat, and it's the first restaurant I've seen with such feature.

Service was great to the point  the cashier came up to me later and asked how the food was. I told him about the soggy bun, but I was satisfied with everything else.

I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is halal.

During the weekdays this place is pretty dead, which is nice.  The burgers are not thick or huge or super well seasoned.  You get a more plentiful serving of ingredients at Harveys. This place is just adequate.

The price is a bit much for what you end up with on your tray.

I wouldnt recommend this place unless youre looking for a burger spot that slaughters the meat in a humane way (halal)."}
