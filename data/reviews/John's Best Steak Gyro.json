{"text":"Great food and fast service...been going there since I was a kid. It's on the way home from work, and generally not too busy when I stop by. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Decor - friendly neighborhood diner motif.

Service - the cashier/waitress was polite and helpful. Even made jokes and small talk with her, while I waited for my food.

Food - the food is the reason for the low review. My veggie gyro was made to order. It smelled and tasted good. Nothing amazing or awful for a gyro. However, a couple hours after my meal, I had to visit the bathroom for quite some time. Since all I had was crackers and gyro for the whole day, I'm going to blame the food!

Overall - friendly staff, but I would not come back due to ill prepared food."}
{"text":"Arrived there at 10:30am (Had an appointment at 11am) I asked how long was the wait for their breakfast combo (sausage/eggs & toast) and was told the wait was 15 minutes; waited for almost 30 minutes and food brought out after people had came in - ordered, got their food & left! 

As I went to the counter and told them I'll just take my $ back; (I had to go) I asked for the manager in which they replied, \"he wasn't there.\" I later called to complain about the service but was hung-up on twice. When I called bk the 3rd time, a representative yelled a profanity at me and hung up on me again.

All this over breakfast?! It's not that serious but don't appreciate being disrespected, cussed at because no one wanted to take responsibility and talk to a dissatisfied customer.

I'll never return there and will advise others not to do so as well."}
{"text":"Theeee dirtiest place I've ever been to in my life. I'm not sure how it stays open and how it has passed health codes and health inspections."}
{"text":"Family owned.  Been there a long time.. must be doing something right.  Staff and owner courteous and friendly.  Really good food.. gyros and such.  They also serve a great breakfast.  Been going to Best Gyro (there are about six in the area) since I was a kid (long time)."}
{"text":"I've driven/walked past this place for years growing up and never thought twice about going inside until a recent visit back home! So glad I did. The menu offering is extensive and it is a great place for both breakfast and lunch. They also have great hours (open 24 hours on Saturdays I believe) and extremely great prices for the food portions they offer! I'll definitely be back on my next visit home. I was pleasantly surprised when I came here for lunch and then back again for breakfast!"}
{"text":"HUGE gyro - be prepared to get messy when you eat one!  I got the combo meal: gyro, fries and a drink for $8.98. Great deal and a lot of food. I'll definitely be going back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Thank you for being you! 
    Dont get to come here often as I don't live in the state but when I do get back its always just how I remember! The gyro was hot, delicious, filling, and beautiful. Staff was friendly which made my visit back even better and I def will try to be back again before I live town.
   If your ever in the area...try it out...great Gyros and also great corned beef! Enough said!"}
