{"text":"This place is AUTHENTIC Italian all the way!  People are speaking Italian, the vibe is Italian... so much fun to be around. The staff is family and KNOW that menu!  All 4 of our meals were supurb, beautiful and delicioso!  The lasagne was meaty & had perfect sauce ballance. The eggplant parm was thinly sliced and had a smooth texture.  The pasta with anchovies, sardines, raisins and peanuts (think thats right) was a great mixture of different/uncanny ingredients that paired very well!  I cant wait to try more! Yum!  This is one of those places that you might over-look because of its location... but we decided to try it and we will most definately be back.  For those bad reviews that touted poor service, or no hours, this is not an Olive Garden. Get over it. They can do what they want... it seems like they have enough repeat business."}
{"text":"This is a family-owned restaurant and it is cared for with great pride.  My husband and I enjoyed a real Italian dinner here a few nights ago.  I loved the prosciutto e melone and he enjoyed the antipasto.  Our main courses were puttanesca for my husband and vitello al parm for me.  Extremely fresh and well prepared.  Roma Caf√© Ristorante will become our \"go to\" restaurant when we want good Italian food."}
{"text":"The staff were friendly but the foods were not that wow! We were not impressed with the sauce were like watery, the calamari was like no taste but rubbery, the eggplant parmigiana had no flavor. Would not come back there again."}
{"text":"This place was Great.  We really liked it.  The staff were attentive, dinner delicious, restaurant clean and nice.  Save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were so excited to find this wonderful Italian restaurant near our house.  It is owned by a very friendly Italian family who serves up great, freshly made food.  Our favorites include the Tortellini alla Roma which has prosciutto and mushrooms, and the Risotto dishes.  But everything we have tried has been excellent!  The soups of the day (often minestrone) are also very good with big chunks of fresh vegetables.  Their desserts are also excellent, particularly the homemade tiramisu and the Italian Cream Cake.    We used to enjoy their lunch buffet during the weekdays, but I'm not sure they have that anymore due to lowered traffic with the economy.  But they do have many of their dishes for lunch specials."}
{"text":"Salmon with mushrooms and artichokes was very good. Great service , enjoyed the complimentary bread. Chicken Alfredo was OK not my favorite. The atmosphere was perfect for a valentines day dinner without the pricey cost of other restaurants."}
{"text":"First time going there last night and was very pleased to find such a fine establishment.  We've lived out here two years, had never heard of this place and certainly have not had any good italian food, until now.  They have a very wide range of italian dishes and regional specialties.  That part is nice but it made it extremely difficult to narrow the choices.  Guess we will have to keep going back.  We were served by a very pleasant woman named Carmen who had a very good knowledge of the menu.  She recommended the house dressing for our salad, a vinagrette, which was awesome.  I had a regional specialty with sardines which was extremely delicious and my partner had spaghetti and meatballs.  He feels that if a place can do the basics well then the rest should be awesome.  Well they passed the test hands down.  I tasted the meatball and it had to be the best I have ever tasted.  You can taste the high quality of their meat.  Everything was extremely good and we look forward to returning there shortly.  Thanks Carmen for such good service!"}
{"text":"Last night in Mesa before heading home, looking for some really good Italian take-out without a lot of driving. Yelp said Roma Cafe would fit the bill, and you were absolutely correct. Marco greeted me at the door, said I'd probably be more comfortable waiting for my order at the bar (he was right!) and poured me a very nice Chianti whil\e I waited. He was busy as the only greeter/waiter, but still made time for a very friendly chat. There was no problem filling my special request (hot pepper flakes on the side: \"It's all made-to-order so that will be easy\" . Ordered putanesca from their extensive (15? 20? More?) list of pasta entreesa, along with calamari fritti for my wife. The wait was probably less than 15 minutes, and very agreeable. Once back at the resort, both the pasta. and the calamari were still hot; I've had better squid but theirs was nicely seasoned and plentiful. The putanesca was excellent, full of fat juicy capers and lots of green olives. There was enough to share, and even a little bit left over. I also loved the side salad, which was a very authentic caesar. I look forward to visiting Mesa again, so we can visit and enjoy the ambiance in person!"}
{"text":"Having recently moved to Mesa AZ choosing a place to dine can be a crap shoot.  We decided to have Italian for dinner and picked Romas as our place to try.  Thinking, if it wasn't what we expected we could cross it off our list of places to go.  My oh my, were we ever pleasantly surprised.  What a great place.  Starting off with out server Marco, all the way to the end with our cappuccinos. Everything was top notch.  I had the sea bass ravioli with sauteed shrimp in a brandy cream sauce.  Every one else in our party raved about their food and the service.  This will definitely be a place we will visit again."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian family owned restaurant. Delicious, friendly, clean, and seated our party of six without reservation.  Reservations best. If you to be treated great and enjoy great food this is your place."}
{"text":"I'm in town visiting relatives and this was our first time and Roma Cafe - It was absolutely outstanding.  Our group had two of the specials (oso buco and lobster ravioli), manicotti, and caesar salad,  and we can't say enough about the place!  Marco was an excellent and attentive server. We really appreciated that the owners stopped by and checked on us.  I really appreciated the quiet place and laid back atmosphere and we can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"my husband took me there on a Saturday evening and we liked it a lot! It was so nice to eat a great Italian meal without having your ears assaulted by the loud music, clanging plates or other clients shouting at each other to be heard over the din. The Italian love songs were just right. The food was very good, and the service excellent. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Can't really comment on the food. From what my friend tells me they are pretty good. But when we went to go eat there they were closed on a Saturday afternoon/evening."}
{"text":"Eccellente!!! A bona-fide family run Italliano ristorante that is a \"MUST\" for anyone in the east valley craving Italliano food.   We ate here last night with my folks whom had been here previously and highly recommended it. The service was very good, but expect it to be a tad on the slow side. This is quite normal over in Italy, so expect it here as the owners are themselves from Italy, and enjoy the great aroma coming from the kitchen as you anticpate a delicious meal arriving at your table. Our server, Carmen was great, the food was absolutely amazing, and the owners even came by to chat us up exuding a great vibe and making us feel very welcome.  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the East Valley.  I eat dinner there at least 3-4 times a month.  The food is authentic Italian....the tomato sauce  (various pasta dishes) is mouth-watering good!!  My favorites are the lasagna, and the veal picatta.  The service is very attentive, from Mama (Anna) to Antonio (Tony, chef and Father) and Marco (Son, and server extraordinaire)."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is rated so high. I ordered the chicken parmesan and my husband ordered whatever a #40 is (some seafood pasta). About 45 minutes later we finally received our entrees. My chicken was so soggy and the sauce was so watered down and tasted terrible. The potatoes it came with were dry and tasteless, and I didn't attempt the vegetables. I had to drain my side of pasta on my bread plate before I can eat it. Though my husband enjoyed his meal, we will not be going back!"}
{"text":"We read good reviews of this restaurant on Yelp. So we gave it a try. My wife had the mussels, and clam's on a bed of pasta, with  what was supposed to be Alfredo sauce, but it was red and watery.  She liked the seafood, but not the sauce. I just had spaghetti with marinara sauce, the sauce was so watery, that I only had a small portion of it. And they did serve a small basket of French bread with the meals. But the bread was not warm, and if you request some more they charge an extra $2.25. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Roma Cafe is a favorite when we're in town. Marco and his dad Antonio deliver the best Italian food every time...from specialty pasta dishes to seafood to veal or chicken Marsalla and Picatta ...it is always amazing. The friendly, family atmosphere is a bonus with the great food! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Very good food!!! Family owned, great to support local businesses!! Good service and great yummy food!!!"}
{"text":"Our go to restaurant for Italian. The atmosphere is quaint and the staff which is the family is outstanding and welcoming. The antipasto was delicious. Everyone enjoyed their dinner. It was my birthday so they served a wonderful tiramisu."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian/ Mediterranean cuisine. Homemade, Organic ingredients. From Seafood to the best bread,great salad and fast service. I, as an Italian, HIGHLY RECOMMEND this restaurant. Really the BEST. Tried others, no comparison. Guarantee you'll LOVE this place."}
{"text":"We love this place! Great, authentic Italian food and more. Our Rotary club meets here weekly and they are like family to us. There is a full bar and they make their own limoncello that is fabuloso. Marco is always our waiter and never forgets a name, a favorite drink or even a favorite appetizer. You just don't find truly family run restaurants like this anymore. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"WONDERFUL!! My friends and I met for dinner last night. We were welcomed and lead to a nice table. atmosphere is surprisingly nicer than the outside of the building! Marco was very friendly and provided good information from the menue. Antonio was friendly and informative too. So many choices on the menue we will have to go back many times to taste all of the HOMEMADE items. If you have tsted the difference between homemade and \"boxed\" or \"canned\" items! ALL FRESH!! Not to mention the home made Lemon Chello---WONDERFUL! Thanks We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"WE love this place. When we take new people there, they are always happy with the food. And the bar really serves a nice full drink! The meals come with a bread and a salad. Fresh veggies always. And the pasta is so tasty. We love the Osso bucco. And The service is tops!"}
{"text":"Wonderful!!! My girlfriend and I travel to Italy very often. My Mom is from Italy and cooks Amazing Authentic Italian Cuisine. Needless to say, we are foodies and know good Italian food. We were looking for a good Italian restaurant in Mesa. We finally were able to try this place after many failed attempts to find a good Restaurant. What a Diamond of a Find...Buon appetito!!!  :)"}
{"text":"I cannot understand how anyone gives this more than 1 or 2 stars. Are these people who think Burger King is fine dining?  I was greeted by an older woman who was somewhat surly, yet I got the impression she's one of the owners.   First disaster was the wine. There is no choice but the house wine if you order by the glass, so I had the Chianti.  Lousy, and served very warm. Not just room temp warm, but almost like the keep the bottle (or maybe box?) by the stove.   Salad was a boring blob of iceberg lettuce with one cherry tomato and a tiny slice of cucumber.  My entree was cannelloni, barely edible.  The pasta was overlooked and hard to eat, and the filling was pretty flavorless.   Seriously, an Olive Garden is a far, far better choice if you feel like Italian-like food. And given my low opinion of Olive Garden, that's saying something."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian restaurant in the east valley. Antonio, Anna, Marco and the entire staff are great!"}
{"text":"We love this place.   We've been here twice and always get seafood which is fresh and well prepared.  It is worthy of a drive out to Mesa - so hop in your car and head on out here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible lasagna, over cooked noodles, processed meat. Frozen Costco lasagna is better. Over priced too. They can make your everyday spaghetti if that's what you're looking for. Very disappointed with my first experience."}
{"text":"An authentic local restaurant. Marco was our server.  He was attentive,  efficient and friendly.   A pleasure to dine with the family.  Our group all had excellent dinners. The staff was friendly and attentive.  Enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"We were out in Mesa, and decided that we were in the mood for Italian. I did a quick search for a non-chain place nearby, and they came up. We came in on a Sunday early evening. It is a small family owned restaurant, where \"dad\" was cooking and the son and mom were serving. They offered a good size menu, with lots of choices. We opted to start with the anti pasta, and it was more like I was used to it being (ie no lettuce) where it's meat, cheese, olives, pickled vegetables. It was very tasty. For our main course, my daughter opted for kids spaghetti, and told us how good it was. I got the lasagna, and it was very good. We really enjoyed the red sauce. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Went there because of the great reviews it had gotten! Service was good ... But was very disappointed by the food!  Calamari was prepackaged and defrosted from frozen, salad was just prepackaged bagged salad with bottled dressing, bread was hard as a rock and lasagna literally tasted like chef boyardee sauce and meat from the ravioli cans! :-( so disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Tonight's trip to Roma Cafe was the worst restaurant experience I have had in months!  I ordered the bruschetta as an appetizer and it was sub-par at best.  The soup tasted like it was out of a middle school cafeteria.  After an hour waiting for our entrees, we cancelled our orders and left.  The place wasn't even that busy!  I had really high hopes for this place, but they were quickly dashed.  In my opinion there are much better Italian options in East Mesa.  Alessia's on Brown Rd.  is probably my favorite as they seem to truly treat their customers like family."}
{"text":"Super limited menu... No one in place for lunch... Meatballs taste frozen and re-cooked. Blah."}
{"text":"The owners are from Italy so everything about the dining experience here is authentic. Get to know the chef. He will likely visit your table for a quick hello. The ingredients are fresh and the meals are artfully prepared with an old-world Italian sensibility. The menu offers plenty of lighter fare as well so there's something here for everyone.  Everyone is treated like family here."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years and absolutely great food and awesome service! Family owned and operated great experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible!  Walked through the door to a not very welcoming hostess.  Sat down with two kiddos (5 and 8 years old) in which they weren't given anything to draw on or color.  The same hostess came and yelled at them for touching a number sign sitting on the table.  Very aggressive to get us drinks and didn't respect us having a family to sit down and eat a nice dinner.  This is NOT a place to bring kids, obviously.  If you don't know how to deal with all sorts of customers or have any sort of customer service experience you should not be running a restaurant!  Feel free to walk in, sit down, and walk right back out just like we did in this situation."}
{"text":"I mean, I guess it is ok. I had the Carbonara. Nothing homemade about any of it. Just ok. I've for sure had better. The lady waitress was the wife of the chef. She's definitely the kind of European not so friendly type. Don't think that she should be the waitress. The chef came out and talked to the table. He seems sweet, so I told him it was lovely. Basically, I'd rather go to Olive Garden, and that's not a place I eat."}
{"text":"Marco, Antonio,Ana...from the moment we walked in Love of food, family and friends greeted us. 6 guest 6 cleaned plates and 6 desserts. Marco said he has never seen 6 people each order their own dessert.   Lemon cello cake and tiramisu. Excellent can't wait to g back."}
{"text":"Good food, great service. Doesn't look like much on the outside but give it a try. Vast menu selection, something for everyone. Pesto sauce was wonderful, as was tomato sauce. Fresh ingredients, good flavor. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great local Italian place!  Family-owned, incredibly friendly. Food delicious. I had the lasagne (meat--with chunks of beef and sausage). Salad was good mix of Romaine & baby greens--lovely homemade Balsamic vinaigrette. Server Marco (son) super and attentive. Owner even talked to me personally. Great little place."}
{"text":"#Whatsamattaforyou ? My mommy wanted authentic Italiano lunch today. So must only go to #RomaCafe. The food is homemade from scratch fabulous, service wonderfully Italian and Chef Antonio is amazing. If you're in East Mesa you have to stop in here for lunch or dinner.  Amiamo questo posto"}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to the Mesa, AZ area and we decided to go to dinner yesterday evening with his brother and sister-in-law.  Of course, we all agreed on pasta and decided to give this restaurant a try.  We weren't sure what it was going to be, but to our surprise it was everything and more than we expected.  We were greeted by the hostess and our waiter was Marco.  What a polite young man he was and he made our dining experience a very pleasant experience.  I had never eaten Gnocchi (Potato Dumplings) so I ordered that and it was served with a meat sauce to die for.  Not over spicy, but a very delicate meat sauce to enjoy.  After dinner we had a Cappuccino and the only thing that could have made it better, was a Rock Candy Sugar Stick to melt in it.  Marco's father came out to the table a couple of times to make sure that our meal was prepared to our liking.  I can't say enough about this restaurant, but I highly suggest that anyone in the East Valley give this restaurant a try. The meals are all reasonably priced and the service was top notch.  Hats off to Roma Caf√© Ristorante."}
{"text":"We were told to go here for a great Italian meal, and we were not disappointed.  We began with the bruschetta which was excellent, and then my husband ordered the ravioli with a side of meatballs, and I ordered the #62 meal (a wonderful linguine dish with fresh asparagus, pistachios, garlic, and an amazing white sauce).  The pasta itself is fantastic - very light (not heavy like you get in many Italian restaurants) and the sauces are primo.  Our server Marco was very quick to please, gave us great recommendations, and checked on us often to make sure that everything was to our satisfaction.  Primo!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but I was literally the only customer there and it still took over 30 minutes for my food to be made, and I waiting at least another 10 after I was finished just for someone to come out and get me the check. I'd have expected a little better attention since they had no other customers. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Wow! Anyone who knows me, knows that I need variety and I am not a creature of habit! Think again! When it comes to Cafe Roma, I can't seem to leave this place alone! Love, love, love the food! Not to mention the owners! Antonio, Ana along with their son Marco, make you feel like you are part of the family! I'm so addicted to the Eggplant, I order it every time! I make sure to always taste my husband's dish, as he mixes it up and usually gets one of the nightly specials because he has never been let down! Tonight we had the mussels as an appetizer and loved them! They were so fresh and tasty and seemed to melt in our mouths! The Calamari is wonderful too and only lightly fried! My husband had a dish that consisted of pork shank with penne pasta and the meat  literally fell off the bone! No knife needed here!  If you find yourself in East Mesa and want GREAT food, this is the place! Not heavy Italian but light and delicious! You will thank me later!"}
{"text":"So,  after finally finding this place again we came in and the staff was outstanding.  So very friendly.  The chef,  his wife,  his son Marco,  the water girls.  Everyone was lovely,  and you could tell they treated everyone like family. The chef came out to our table to talk with us and everything.  We were disappointed in the food though,  found it bland,  and the lobster ravioli was not lobster,  it was imitation crab,  and it was $24!!!!! Risotto was dry, clumpy and tasted bad, shrimp were overcooked. Everything needed seasoning.  : ( We won't be back,  but it was a fun experience. 5 stars for heart& atmosphere.  1 star for food.   The heart overcame the food,  and I swayed the 2.5 stars in the 3 direction."}
{"text":"Great place - food, prices, hospitality, and atmosphere.  Small, cute, clean, and comfortable place for both lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Sorry, but I was pretty disappointed with our experience at Roma.  Took the family out to experience a different Italian restaurant and when we got through at Roma's we all agreed for the price we paid, the food and service wasn't there.  It's one of the few times we left an Italian restaurant without any doggy-bags.  Everyone was willing to leave the leftovers, which is a sign that we aren't looking forward to the food again.  It may have been just one of those night for Roma, but unfortunately I'm not sure we'll give it another try."}
{"text":"For those of you who crave real Italian food served in a family oriented atmosphere, this is the place! The owner/chef is authentic, and every dish we tried was not just good, it was great! Eggplant parmigiana made from scratch brings back memories of East Coast splendor. Tiramisu made on site will have you dreaming  about the next time you eat it.  Saltimbocca the way grandpa made it! I cannot say enough about the food and e people who run the restaurant, a warm friendly family who take food and warmth seriously. Try it,  you'll be back for more!!"}
{"text":"A very disappointing  experience .   I went there last night for dinner, and was very disappointed .  The prices are high, the food is good,but not worth the money 2 people  came  to dinner, each had a pasta dish, no drinks, no appetizers and no desserts .   The bill $35.00. The pasta  was not home made, and when the meals were served there was NO fresh cheese. It was tasty but not worth that kind of money, and even 5 he tasted as store bought . ..."}
{"text":"This is my friends favorite restaurant, so I got us take out for work.  I called ahead and the woman just kept telling me how busy they would be and that I better be on time.  I was, and of course had to wait anyway, despite there being no one in there.  We got Eggplant Parmesan and Gnocchi.  The eggplant was absolutely awful.  Soggy, pale pieces of eggplant on bow tie pasta.  If I hadn't known what it was I wouldn't have been able to guess.  The sauce is like water with some tomato chunks in it.  The salad is pre-made bag salad, and the bread is hard, store bought rolls.  My friend had the gnocchi and said it didn't seem homemade at all.  I cannot imagine anyone actually eating this, let alone enjoying it.  I am throwing mine away, so that was $35 wasted.  My advice...keep driving."}
{"text":"About thirty of us Miata Clubbers went to Cafe Roma for a car show and dinner today. Everyone treated us very well. We had the whole parking lot, with music, prizes and lots of car talk going on all over the place. We then moved to the dining area where we all had lunch/dinner. The staff took orders quickly, delivered drinks and salads in short order. This was followed by either an order off the menu or the buffet line. The buffet was surprisingly good, just a few items but all were cooked well (not overcooked). Those that ordered from the menu were happy with their selection. The staff did a great job of taking care of everyone quickly and with friendly service, orders of more bread and refill of drinks  were quickly filled. All in all a great day of car stuff, good food and camaraderie."}
{"text":"Had to write a few words about Roma cafe because they deserve it! To start I'd like to say they are so nice a its family ran from the front of the house to the back and it was so nice to get to meet first the mother, then their son our waiter, then be checked on by the father \"the chef\" at the end of our meal was very nice!! This place was family friendly, they will even make any meal on the menu into a junior portion which nobody does and I love that we get that option;) we ordered two of the daily specials one for my husband being the Italian meatloaf second being crab and shrimp ravioli for our daughter and both were awesome! I ordered the chicken Florentine and our son ordered spaghetti and meatballs and we both were super satisfied everything especially with the freshness and portion size! everything was so good that even though we were stuffed to the max we opted to get desert... 2 homemade cannolis... They were awesome and a perfect end to an amazing meal!! We are definitely going to be returning and would recommend anyone that hasn't tried Roma's...SHOULD! Thank you Roma for a great dinner and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Expansive options of tried and true Italian classics served up competently. Relative to the options in the area, a pretty good dinner."}
{"text":"I'm very picky about where I go out to eat and even a little skeptical by the location but if you like authentic Italian food you have to go here. It's ran by an Italian family and it is DELICIOUS! It will be our regular spot for Italian food for a long time to come! Try it. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Was brought here by my cousin. It was St. Patrick's Day so it wasn't crowded.  The food was outstanding, the staff were very friendly...definitely hope to return when in the area."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. I arrived for lunch at 1:30 with my handicapped 80 year old mother. After getting her walker and getting her out the car and slowly walking in we were met at the door by a rude lady yelling \"We, re closed, we're closed. The posted hours for lunch are 11am-2pm and we were there at 1:30. The lady was very rude and we will not be coming back. There are too many other restaurants to eat at that honor their posted hours of operation and offer a welcoming to their customers."}
{"text":"We found this little jewel today. It is a family owned place that is truly shows the love.   The pasta dishes were cooked well and seasoned exceptionally. The special linguine with clams and muscles were excellent with a spicy sauce. In an earlier post someone mentioned price being an issue with the specials. We did not find that to be true. Both specials ordered, the seafood and the bracciole were similarly priced to other pasta dishes.   The Veal Marsala was excellent as well. You could really taste the good quality Marsala used. The pasta with artichokes and capers also used the best quality capers I have seen since Sicily.    If you can, save a little room for dessert. The cannoli should not be missed.   This will become a regular stop when we are in town."}
{"text":"The pork oso bucco is last meal worthy! Seriously. This is a wonderful family owned and operated business."}
{"text":"This restaurant menu is fantastic! The salad was crisp and their home vinagarette is nice, light and tart! I had the lasagna and the pasta and sauce were excellent! Try this place out and you'll agree!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken Marsala. The mushrooms were tasty however the chicken was dry and lacked flavor. It was a thin sliced piece of breast meat that was over cooked and tasted previously frozen. The dinner rolls were soft but cold and dry. The employees were very nice but the food was not good."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and superb service. This was our first experience at this restaurant. It is family owned and ran, and all of the folks are so hospitable. We did not have the buffet special, I had eggplant parmigiana, which was to die for. The butterfly pasta was cooked to perfection, and the sauce was divine. We will definitely return for many more meals."}
{"text":"When the owner comes out to greet you with a hand shake and a smile you know you are going to get great service. In a time when service is hard to find you will find it here. The food was great made fresh to order. We will definetly go back."}
{"text":"Very expensive for what you get. I got better meatballs at Costco. Meat sauce had about two tablespoons of meat in it. Pasta with meat sauce is 14.50. They never refilled our drinks. I would not go back.  Service sucked. Took forever to get the check."}
{"text":"Great place.  Family was warm and welcoming.  Service was fast but not rushed.  Food was fantastic.   Will be making this a weekly stop."}
{"text":"Roma Cafe is in the retail plaza at Main and Sossaman, but in a free-standing building at the west end. The exterior is nondescript. The interior is cozy - the walls dark and covered with photos and other decoration. There are more than 70 dishes on the menu, from chicken to pasta, seafood to salad. The bread basket is mediocre at best, with those little packaged pats of butter. I have heard that there is a charge for more bread, which is not cool. But, we didn't need more, so we dodged that bullet. The starter salad with vinaigrette was also nothing to write home about: lettuce and one slice of cucumber. The dressing was ok. A tomato or small carrot shred would. Have done wonders. I wanted something simple, like a cacio e pepe, but simple wasn't on the menu. I suppose they might have made it if I had asked, bit I didn't. But like I said, the menu had tons of choices. The meals came in a good amount of time, and our beverages never ran dry. I ordered the special lobster ravioli, and my husband had what I think was called Risotto di Marco. Marco was our waiter, and the son of owners Ana and Chef Antonio. It was basically a cioppino over risotto instead of pasta. My husband raved about it. I loved mine as well, although the crab cream sauce was made with imitation crab. The bill for two meals and nin-alcoholic beverages was around $50, so a little bit pricey for two meals. My husband's plate was large and filling. Mine could have used a few more ravioli, but left me satisfied just the same.  We were very excited to find a great Italian place so close by! When you can order in Italian and the Italian-speaking elders all eat there, you know it's legit. We will be returning for sure, and recommend it for anyone who likes good Italian."}
{"text":"This family run restaurant has really good food, but it's quite pricey and the portions are small. Love the old school Italian atmosphere, but don't love having to pay for more bread when what you were given in the first place was skimpy. Service is rather slow even when it's not busy, almost like eating in Europe. Sometimes closed when sign says should be open."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed out meal at Roma Cafe tonight.  We had a Restaurant.com coupon which made it even better.  The Lasagna and sauce over it were wonderful, just a little slight on the portion size, considering nothing came with it except a small salad and a small bread basket (you have to pay $2.25 for extra bread).  Service was attentive and she was very knowledgeable of the menu.  The Caesar Salad with calamari and shrimp was delicious and made for a huge entree."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Family owned and operated with fresh food. The son/waiter offers great wine pairing. The linguine is spectacular. Start with the calamari. Very yummy. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been patrons of Roma Cafe since before it relocated a couple years ago.  The family is so nice and welcoming, and the food is amazing.  I love their pasta dishes, and my family typically orders the specials.  And when whoever is taking your order asks \"soup or salad?\" - always get the soup, no matter what it is!  It will be to die for, I promise you."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on 'Check Please! Arizona' a PBS show and they gave this place pretty good ratings. We were seated and I didn't know who our server was, but after awhile, I figured it out. Mainly, all the servers help each other out. My wife ordered a glass of Chianti which she loved so much that she bought a bottle. I started with the Insalata Gorgonzola and Isalata Contadina. Both salads were fresh and enjoyable. I followed that with Carbonara and you get to pick the pasta. I chose Angel Hair. Chosing the pasta is important because my dish the pasta was clinging to each other and I probable should have ordered the Linguini or Fettucini. My wife ordered the Pesto with Linguini and she loved hers.  Our server was just there to take orders and didn't seem very happy to be there. But the lady server that help us in between was friendly and enjoyable to talk to. This restaurant is pretty far for us, 40 minutes, and I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Great selection and reasonably priced. Excellent service. Food is made from scratch and very tasty.  Best calamari I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Went there 3 weeks ago for my friend's graduation dinner. Lots of choices, low prices, excellent service, and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Went in and waited to be seated for about 10 min. And was completely ignored the waitress sat people who came in after us with 6 plus because  she knew them. Very disrespectful will never be going there again"}
{"text":"3.5 is a better rating. Service was good then nothing then good. Food was ok. Sauces are to bland like others have stated but the meats tasted good. The meatballs and sausage was good and the canoloni was good inside but again, the sauce was to plain. Bread was ok but how about some olive oil? Salad was bag salad like most restaurants these days, at least it was fresh. People were friendly but they seemed understaffed. We liked the decor and atmosphere and the place was clean!"}
{"text":"I must say I am visiting from Texas and I came across this restaurant and called and they said come on in. I am Greek and I have been to many restaurants and no one came close to my daddy's linguini and clams until now. I thought my dad was in the kitchen. Tony the owner cooked a delicious meal and his son Marco and Tonys wife were wonderful! I highly recommend for you to visit and dine it. They will make you feel at home.... The Chocolate Martini was delicious..... Originally I am from Boston..."}
{"text":"Are they still in business?  Went by for Saturday lunch and not a soul to be seen. Also, their hours on the door a completely different than on their website (we were there at 11:15am)."}
{"text":"This *was* our go-to Italian place.   +++ The food is good; chicken piccata, calamari, cannolis, eggplant parm, all excellent.  Nice 'old Italian' ambience. The waiter we usually get (I believe it's the son?) is very jovial and kind.  ----  Upcharge for bread refills Prices are high for the portions; I never have leftovers from Roma Cafe, and I ALWAYS have leftovers anywhere else. While the waitstaff is friendly, they are generally very slow. Last time we went in a small group of 6, we were there for a solid 2 hours because he just never checked back. I guess they assume if you are talking, you aren't done?  The older woman (owner/owner's wife?) is rather unpleasant and does not seem happy about being there.   I say \"was\" our go-to place because we will not be back after last weekend. Their obviously recently made, handwritten sign says they close at 9pm on weekends. We were getting out of the car at 7:55 and the older woman poked her head out and made that \"Um... yeah....\" face. My fianc√© confusedly asked if they were closing and she just nodded and said \"Yeah.... sorry......\" (though it was more of 'sorry not sorry').   I have a special pet peeve spot in my brain for businesses who don't adhere to their own hours. If you live any distance, make sure to call first."}
{"text":"I could have been in Italy having one of the best meals possible. The eggplant was fabulous. Not your typical eggplant with breading but fresh and lightly sauteed. The sauce was light and homemade tomato sauce. The fettuccine alfredo was light and wonderful. The owners are Italian. They were very attentive and refreshing. The service was impeccable."}
{"text":"My husband and I randomly stopped here for dinner while we were staying in Scottsdale and I'm so happy we did! The food was amazing!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to have dinner and after looking at our options on Yelp we decided to try Roma Cafe. We pleasantly pleased with the cleanliness of the restaurant. We were greeted quickly by a friendly lady and seated. The owner came over and greeted us talked about the different items on the menu and the fish that was fresh that day. He answered questions on different dishes and made recommendations. Our waiter came and took our cocktail requests and also brought us water without us having to ask.   I ordered Chicken Florentine and my husband ordered Cioppino.Both meals were out of this world. Salad and bread were also served. We shared tiramisu for dessert and it was by far the best we have ever had.  Our entire visit was fantastic and will make this one of our \"go to\" places to eat!"}
{"text":"Based on most of the reviews we had pretty high expectations but were horribly disappointed. Imitation crab meat on the seafood ravioli and pre-made sausage chunks like you get on a Domino's pizza in the lasagna. The lunch lady at Mesa High wouldn't do that.On top of that the red sauce was bland, probably out of a jar of Ragu from Fry's. Either folks in Mesa don't know what good food is or you need to be part of the mob to get a decent Italian meal at Roma's."}
{"text":"Looking to try a new place, we found this place and based on rating we decided to give it a try.  No wait for our party, we were immediately sited.  Our entrees came with either a choice of soup or Salad.  Soup was ok, def can be Better and have had better else where.  Our food was Bland and sauces water down. Compared to other restaurants I think this restaurant is over prized for the quality of Food and Service you get."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. ...great Italian food,  service was very good.  We had 3 children,  they accomdated us with reservations of 8. Will definitely will  be back. Wonderful family, even gave us an extra desert!  Well worth the trip, the outside doesn't do justice for the inside.  We were all very happy with our meals and desserts.  See you soon!"}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior fool you. Driving by Roma Cafe, it looks like a greasy spoon, with neon advertizement stickers on the windows.. The food here was excellent ..fresh made pasta. rich sauces. When we went, they had a guy jamming on a Yamaha keyboard for entertainment. I cannot wait to go back.. i had the Chicken Picatta $15 delish!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us, was expecting some great spaghetti and meatballs but what I got was terrible marinara sauce, wife had white sauce plate said it tasted water downed. Service was just ok, also prices are a little higher than on the menu when the wife asked about it the lady got rude and asked if we knew how much new menus cost. Will never go back this was the worst Italian food we have ever had."}
{"text":"Since I left Italy, I've been searching for that authentic Italian restaurant.  This place was a drive for me but well worth the trip. The place is in the middle of nowhere and doesn't look like much on the outside. As soon as I opened the door, the smell alone reminded me of being back in Italy.  The waiting staff was attentive but not hovering.  Its a family own place grandma coming out every once in a while to see how everyone is doing.  Each dish I had looked well prepared and tasted great all the way down to dessert washed down with limoncello.  I highly recommend checking the place out."}
