{"text":"State Street* has a here-today, gone-tomorrow feel about it.  I've lived in Madison for slightly over two years and not many of businesses from my first visit are left.  Yummy Buffet, the Russian Dumpling place, Real Chili, Fuddrucker's, a couple of small ladies' clothing stores (sorry, don't go in them), etc.  The list of new arrivals is equally long.  D.P. Dough, American Outfitters, The Love Shack, The Crab House.  For a college town, Madison is devoid of local institutions.

Nick's is not one of these fly-by-night operations.  It feels like it's been around for a while, and it's true - Nick's has been open since the 70's, I hear.  The floor is old, the wooden paneling is old, the booths are worn: much more New York or Chicago than Madison.  It's one of these places where you fully expect to pay cash only at an old fashion register - you know, one that looks like an over-sized type-writer.  Zero concessions to modern business models.  

What is surprising is the mediocrity of the place.  How has it stayed, when everything else just goes?  I've had hamburgers at Nick's, Club Sandwiches at Nick's, Liver and Onions at Nick's, Grilled Cheese at Nick's, and it's always a disappointing, soggy, indifferently prepared meal.  Or does everyone not agree?  

Someone, please explain Nick's to me.  Is it the pie?  

*For non-locals, State Street is a pedestrian mall that connects the Capitol to the University of Wisconsin Campus.  It's only a few blocks long, but it feels like a major commercial and cultural thoroughfare.  That should tell you something about Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Nick's.  I love Nick's Restaurant.  Let me preface by saying I haven't actually had anything to eat there.

I like stopping in to get a drink before a show at the Overture.  It is right across the street, and the bartender guy is always very friendly.  It feels like a classic old-time diner, minus the cloud of smoke I would get in mountain country bars back in day (living out west).

I like being able to stop in, have a drink, and inconspicuously head on into the night."}
{"text":"I initially loved Nick's - it was cute, divey, and Greek, what's not to love? Our waitress was a total sweetheart, which I think saved the rating.

We were first brought mini-glasses of water, which were about a shot of water a piece. A pitcher would've been nice as well (rather than trying to get refills after a few tries).

I was so excited to get the feta-stuffed chicken with american fries, and my boyfriend to get the BBQ special of the day. Our meals arrived quickly (pro) but my chicken was completely raw (looked like it came straight from the fridge without meeting the oven) and boyfriend's BBQ was full of chunks of carrots (?). Our waitress was very sweet and brought my chicken to be re-cooked, but at htat point I was fairly grossed out by it already. No refund/special was offered (free dessert? soda?). Unfortunately, I had high hopes but was dissappointed with the food.

If I go back, it will be strictly for cocktails."}
{"text":"Nick's is what it is and it always will be...and that's the way it should be.  A throwback to something you could have easily found on State St. in the 40's and 50's...oh, I guess you could have found it then too!  Nick's is the place to get no-nonsense food, good drinks and yes, the decor is EXACTLY what it should be.  If you've walked by here for years and looked in with trepidation, relax, walk in, hang your coat up, sit down, eat, drink and you will have a great time!"}
{"text":"They have the best Greek salad in Madison, ripe tomatoes, lots of feta cheese, the right balance of oil, vinegar,and lemon in the dressing. Add the grilled chicken breast if you what a  hearty meal.  Fast friendly service and a Madison icon."}
{"text":"This is the place on State Street to avoid the crowds. I never considered it a restaurant. Sure, the pies are good, and you can grab a few snacks with your drinks. But mostly this is a great place to pull up in a large booth with a group of friends, have a few drinks, and talk until you are hoarse. You can always get a table, which worries me. I have no idea how a place like this in that expensive location can be profitable. The wood paneling, faded velvet paintings, and great juke box really do give the time warped feeling that a previous reviewer mentioned. There's nothing retro about it, because the place has always looked exactly as it is. And that's great, when I want a modern-flashy bar, there are plenty to choose from. There's only one Nicks."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Nick's in college and always enjoyed the old school decor and unexpected fact that it offers multiple sandwich options for vegetarians. We went on a whim today for lunch.

Typically I give a less-than-successful restaurant server the benefit of the doubt in all but extreme cases. As a former server I know that there are often many variables out of your control when it comes to food availability, kitchen promptness, and staffing issues. None of these seemed to be the reason behind our miserable experience at Nick's today. Our server just seemed straight up incompetent. 

After we sat with our drinks for 20-25 minutes after we'd ordered (and it was not busy) it became obvious that our server had taken my boyfriend's meal to the wrong table. By the time she realized her error, my plate had sat in the window for ten minutes. She brought me the soggy veggie melt with a vague apology about the wait we could anticipate for his plate to arrive. When it did, fiveminutes later, she dropped it off without a word and proceeded to avoid us for the rest of our meal. My theory is she was anticipating a complaint so she drew less anxiety from simply standing behind the bar and chatting with her colleagues. My boyfriend had to walk up to her to ask for drink refills after she attended to the table next to us, but walked right past our empty glasses.

Besides the food being soggy and bland, the service was ultimately the biggest disappointment. The place seemed really disorganized and every time an order would be up, the servers all seemed really confused about was on the plates and where they should go. 

Rarely do I stiff a waitress by leaving less than 20 percent. Rarely do I take to the Internet to complain. Today I did both. I hope my experience was a fluke and doesn't indicate such a vast decline in the restaurant's food and service, but I probably won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday for lunch, and they weren't that busy. Waitstaff/hosts did not greet us at the door, as they were sitting and standing around the bar. I came with a party of 7 and one waitress simply pointed to a table instead of leading us there. That's my only complaint. 
A different waitress was our server and she was attentive, friendly, and quick. I ordered the spinach and feta pie which was delectable. The other members of my party were also satisfied with their meals."}
{"text":"OMG....never go to Nick's. Passed by the restaurant on a Friday.  They had a huge Fish Fry Menu posted outside (looked very inviting).  When we got in (I assume the owner Nick) asked if we had a reservation.  The restaurant was EMPTY.  We replied \"no\" and he said loudly \"figures\".  We were not lead to a table, but were told we could sit where there were not reserved signs.  So, we sad down where we were told it was ok and then were asked to move to a \"2 Top\".  The waitress told us it was about to become busy (really), and that we needed to move.... with NO ONE in the restaurant.  I told her we were not feeling very welcome and uncomfortable.  She went to the bar and told the owner. He loudly said \"then they should have gotten a reservation\".  Even the entire bar was \"EMPTY.\"  By then we were so offended we got up to leave.  He balled me out for coming in without a reservation.  I told him he should then take down the large signs outside inviting people in.  He told me \"good luck\" and I replied \"good luck to you!\".  He said he did not need luck.  ANYONE who treats customers like that needs more than luck.  They need to learn how to run a restaurant and how to treat people.  Went down the street and had a GREAT fish fry and great service.  Assuming the food at Nick's was as bad as the attitude he did us a favor!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in before a play at the Overature as I had read good things on Yelp about it.  We were not disappointed!  Its a small place and it was busy so we were stuck in a table in the middle of the room, but not to worry.  The wait staff was very attentive and kept us filled with soda as we waited for our meal.

Three of us had the gyros and my wife had the burger.  The gyro's are excellent!  Lots of meat and the pita bread was fresh and soft.  The cucumber sauce was just the right tartness.  The burger was meh. . .  Not bad, just meh.

But everyone raved over the fry's!!  Perfectly done and had a bit of spice to them.  I'd get just a plate of them if I was just in the mood for an appetizer.

All in all, a gem of a place for Madison."}
{"text":"Not too bad!  Get the fried cheese curds -- YUM!  Good selection of beer, too."}
{"text":"This place was pretty decent. They had pretty good Bloody Mary's. They used Tito's vodka. Staff was very nice and friendly. Good potatoes and bar food. Easy place to find and pretty clean. A few people came in with children so I take it that this is a good place for kids too. Drinks are reasonably priced. Decor was pretty cool in here. A lot of theatre pictures. I'd recommend coming here before or after the overture."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite breakfast spot, especially when I'm hungover. The omelettes are great and the hashbrowns perfectly crispy. Very solid bloody mary as well!! I can always get a spot here even on busy Farmer's Market mornings"}
{"text":"Great local restaurant! Diner-ish experience. I love the grilled cheese, but everything I've had has been consistantly good. Don't forget the pie for dessert!"}
{"text":"We stop in here before every concert or show at the Overture Center and it always pleases me.  It's sort of a throw back to days when the service and food, the quality of drinks, and the coldness of the beer mattered.  Fish fry is perfect, cheese curds can't be beat, steak sandwich is delicious.  Yummy."}
{"text":"I'm just in Madison for a couple weeks, and stopped in Nick's on a tip off that it was one of the best gyros I could get around.  

I can't complain about the gyro - it was pretty good, nothing miraculous, but the meat felt non-mystery (always nice) and the pita was fluffy and good.  

So if the food was only pretty good, why five stars?  

Because this place is amazing.  It's like walking back half a century, and not in the pseudo-ironic way of Brooklyn restaurants made to look old.  This is just a place that hasn't changed.  Man with a martini at the bar who knew everyone.  Chatty bartender, lovely waitresses, the kind of place where you want to say they were just a peach or a doll because it would work.  Great, low key music, and a good bottled beer selection.  

Thumbs up."}
{"text":"The food - especially the weird looking pie - is absolutely terrifying here, but the place is pure Greek-Wisconsin classic.  I remember it being a long, narrow joint with some worn out old booths and a long counter with some bar stools.  Great drinks and a really fun, low-key place to hang out late night."}
{"text":"Ordered a med rare burger and it came well done and smelled like it was very near going bad. Service was decent, and I felt bad for the waitress for the kitchen serving a rare burger to someone who ordered a medium. I don't like to give bad reviews but this experience was very bad."}
{"text":"It's a diner. Nothing fancy. It wants to be a supper club, but it's a dingy diner. Food is okay. If you're going here before a show at the Overture, know that this is nothing more than a diner. Your lady in her heels and little black dressed will not be impressed. If you're looking for some good greasy food at a wood-paneled dive, then you'll love this place. It's all about expectations."}
{"text":"This is going to be short and sweet. I just had lunch here for the first time in many years. Nothing had changed. It was the heart of lunchtime but there were very few folks present.

My friend and I split the Greek Chicken Salad. The salad was chock full of crisp romaine lettuce, ripe tomatoes, crunchy cuke, red onion and and loads of delicious feta cheese. Atop the salad sat a very lovely sliced chicken breast. The breast was steaming hot and incredibly juicy. No dry cold chicken here. We asked for some tzatziki sauce instead of salad dressing. It was creamy yogurt heaven. 

We had plenty to eat and felt healthy to boot. The waitress was attentive and responsive. 

I want to go back for the soup that I love that I can never pronounce.... avgolemono. The waitress said that soup is available  always on Friday, often on Wednesday and sometimes on Saturday. That about wraps it up."}
{"text":"Went in there at midnight on a Friday for a drink, they told us they were closing up. On State Street?! LAME! The food is mediocre. The decor makes me feel like that is where people go to die. It's a good idea but carried out so badly."}
{"text":"This place is kind of amazing... it's like walking into a time capsule. It's a gem hidden in plain sight. This is my go-to place for before or after event drinks. This is a place you can walk right in without a wait before heading to the Overture or Majestic, when other nearby restaurants and bars might be mobbed. A place to sit and relax instead of wondering if you can be in and out with enough time to make it to your curtain call. 
If you enjoy comfort, homeyness and a low-key bar experience over hip or trendy digs then this place will do it for you. I've tried some of the food and it wasn't half bad either. The one area that could use improvement is the extremely bare bones restroom that is located in the basement... the ceiling is very low and claustrophobic. I appreciate they are working with what they have and the restroom has been clean every time I've used it.  
Try it out you may just fall in love with it's mix of epic 80's tunes piped in over the speakers, mood lighting and it's $5 Old Fashions."}
{"text":"We were visiting my parents in Madison (making us a party of 7) and were starving for breakfast.  It was a holiday and a lot of places were closed or had long lines.  We passed by Nick's figuring we were running out of options. The person who I think is the owner sat us down and took our order.  Since it was more like brunch time, some of us had breakfast, some had lunch.  We were the only ones there when we got there, and maybe the place was half full (at most) when we got our food. 

It took FOREVER to get our meals, and before it came the guy we think is the owner passed us off to a waitress that just arrived.  I'm sure he wanted to give her a table right away, but she of course had no idea what any of us ordered.  When the food finally came they forgot my dad's breakfast -- straightforward eggs over easy, bacon and toast.  The waitress said it would be coming right up.

It took another 5-10 minutes to get his eggs, which I really hate.  When it came the waitress didn't really apologize, only said it got chaotic.  I hate servers with bad attitudes. I couldn't help but tell her we were the only ones in the restaurant when we ordered (and truthfully if a small restaurant half-full is chaotic for a couple of waitresses to manage then I wouldn't want to be there when they are busy.)  She got defensive and said she got there 5 minutes before our food came out and had no control over the kitchen.  When the bill came the waitress was not at all apologetic for the long wait or the mess up.  To top it off they charged us for the particularly delayed plate, which I feel is a rookie mistake.  When the kitchen messes up and someone has to practically eat by themselves they should take something off to repair for the annoyance.  

As far as the food goes it wasn't that great either.  My ham and cheese omelette had small pieces of sliced ham instead of chunks, which made it seem like it was supposed to be for a sandwich (petty I know but it didn't look professional). Hashbrowns were good.  My husband's patty melt and my son's burger they said where good. My mom said her food was cold, and my daughter barely touched her turkey melt (which was more like turkey on toast than a turkey melt).  The kids said the deep fried cheese curds were the best they ever had. So if you are hungry for those this seems to be the place.

Overall the place doesn't feel clean to me.  The kitchen is in a low-ceiling basement at the bottom of the stairs right across from the bathrooms.

My parents said they have been there a few times before because it's right across from the Overture Center, but I really doubt they will ever be back. They were embarrassed they suggested it since it was not a big success.  We won't be back...ever."}
{"text":"We arrived 90 minutes before a show at the Overture on a Sunday night. We waited nearly an hour for our food. And when it came, the sandwiches were cold. There was barely enough time to wolf down our food and make the show. The grilled chicken salad was a salad (sans chicken) that had been sitting on the counter for 45 minutes. Several times the waitress and manager apologized and thanked us for understanding, saying the kitchen had been backed up (and that he had gone downstairs to do some cooking himself) . Well, we didn't understand. They did offer to pay for our cocktails, which we accepted. I'd like to \"like\" NIck's but this experience was pretty hard to swallow. I can't see going back."}
{"text":"Hey put some Windex on it! 

To start, the ambience and decor at Nick's are second-to-none if you're interested in a flashback to the days of the rat pack. Let's just say that if Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra hopped in a time machine and came to present day Madison, this is where you'd find them. 

I had the fish sandwich with fries; both were great. For me fries can make-or-break a spot, and Nick's fries definitely made the cut. 

It's just a really cool atmosphere and a really cool restaurant. The fact they don't really have a kitchen, opting instead for a flat-top grill out in the open, just adds to the overall experience. 

Realistically, I'd give the place a 6/5 if I could."}
{"text":"Got to show some love to my Wednesday lunch spot! I LOVE Nick's Wednesday special, Greek style chicken. It is a 10.95 special that comes with an herb crusted chicken thigh and leg, roasted potatoes, and a lemon cream of ? soup. Not sure what the soup is called but it is yummy! The chicken is heavily coated with olive oil, and has a bunch of seasonings and lemony flavors. Extremely tasty! This dish reminds me of the Greek chicken I used to eat back when I lived in Chicago. Christine has been my server every Wednesday that I've gone. She is awesome! During the summer when the patio is out, I have a lunch date with my little pooch. Christine brings him water and she is so attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"They have Pepsi products!  Huzzah.  We went here in the middle of a concert.  My husband had the mushroom swiss burger...his take, he'd get it again but next time we have to try the cheese curds.  I had the Mediterranean steak sandwich.  It was a bit messy, but tasty.  I'd recommend getting the pita on the side and assemble it yourself. Easier to pick up and it won't get soggy. The side salad was mediocre and the blue cheese dressing wasn't so desirable.  The service was good."}
{"text":"The gem of State street is Nick's. The exterior is unassuming, but the interior is like stepping back in time. Nick's is not quite a supper club, not a standard pub, but a classic restaurant with reasonable prices and a simple menu. The Greek influence is found in many of the entrees but stands out the most in the soup. It's indescribable! The tangy coleslaw is a close second. The staff is attentive and the Old Fashioneds are served in the classic Wisconsin style. Make it a point to stop into Nick's if attending an Orpheum show, or after a trip down State."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place. The man (who I assume is the owner) was NOT friendly. We asked a simple question on how he made his Bloody Mary. His reply \"do we have time for this.\" We were planning to get food here but decided to take our money else where."}
{"text":"Heather's a doll face.

Heavy cosmopolitan. 

7 plays on a jukebox for 2 bucks.

Amazing cheese curds.

Down-to-the-floor urinal."}
{"text":"I feel like Nick's is one of the \"hidden gems\" of State Street!  Although the menu is a pretty standard selection of American cuisine, it is always delicious!  Plus, the service is always good, & the ambiance is always authentic & \"homey\"."}
{"text":"On the one hand, the bacon cheeseburger and fries were absolutely delicious.
On the other, our service was ridiculous. Soon after we entered, we were greeted and told a booth would be cleaned for the five of us, which was wonderful. After a while, though, we thought maybe we'd been forgotten (it's also a very busy weekend, so we understood they were busy). When one gal asked another if a table for five was available, because she noticed we'd just been standing around, the gal she was speaking to said \"well I've cleaned off a table for five, but I don't know if that's for these people.\" She said it right in front of us, as if we couldn't see and hear her from six feet away. We were the only party of five waiting. A few minutes later, we were seated. Someone should have taken a name to prevent the confusion. And never call customers \"these people,\" it's rude.

The place is charming, but my god, at least do some cleaning. The floors dont NEED to be dirty. You can have character without being filthy. After washing my hands in the bathroom, I left feeling more dirty.

What irked me the most was our (apparently) busy bartender/server, who was the same \"these people\" commenter. She never checked on us to see what we thought of the baklava, which was the most disgusting thing I've had in my mouth in a long time. She'd asked if we wanted it warmed up, and I said just a little bit, but when we got it, it was soggy, freezing cold (except the small portion that warmed, somehow), and was overloaded with cinnamon. Baklava should be at least room temperature, and always crisp. She never asked us how it was, which was irritating because I would've appreciated a substitute for something I didn't eat.
She also didn't tell us that we had to go to the bar to pay, so we waited much longer than we wanted to because we assumed that she would take our cards at the table.
When we finally noticed her nodding us over to the bar, we went and paid there. Her excuse was \"yeah, I'm bar tending, so I can't just..\"
I don't care. You should have said something, or taken the twenty seconds from your TWO bar customers to take our checks. The whole place was practically empty by then (five tables including ours, and the rest were 1- and 2-tops), and I'm sure one of the dozen of you there could have made that slight inconvenience for us."}
{"text":"The food is good and the people are nice, but I really don't think the portions were worth what i paid.  I left sort of hungry.  I had a feta stuffed chicken and like I said, it tasted good, but for the $12-15 range in Wisconsin, I was shocked to get the amount of meat you'd find in McDonald's quarter pounder.  Yeah there was the gooey cheese and the stir-fried vegetables, but overall, wasn't worth the price."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to have reservations for dinner on a Friday evening, this place is busy!  Nice atmosphere, great food, exellent service, and fair prices, we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We ate there twice this week because of some events at the Overture and were satisfied with both the food and waitstaff. Greek salad was decent and the turkey sandwich very good. It is really fun to eat at the bar and see the Greek intercom system they have here. It's a dumbwaiter that looks like a dishwasher with the door removed. The food comes up from the kitchen thats in the basement and the dude that passes it out to the waitstaff  sticks his head in the dumbwaiter and yells to the cook in the basement what he needs! Really old technology but it has been working here for decades. The two big Greeks who work the bar and service area, who I am sure are named either Gus or Nick, were very pleasant and friendly as were the waitress. This has got to be the oldest place on state street and does show some wear but is clean and fun to eat here."}
{"text":"Nice strong drink for a good price :) Haven't tried the food yet, but recommend stopping in for a good drink if you're out and about on State Street."}
{"text":"I like how this is a retro bar that is also a diner...making it a good place for a hangover cure with a mimosa or bloody mary in the morning, but that is pretty much the bright side.

Service is fine and they do a have an outdoor eating area on State.  We went for brunch.  My friend's ordered omlete's that were not really memorable.  We were disappointed to find the Greek omlet contained gyro meat rather thant he tomato, olive and feta that we were hoping for.  I wanted to order an omlet, but found that they would not make egg white omlets, even for extra that I was willing to pay.

I ordered coffee with skim and splenda and was given 2% with soggy packets of sweet and low.  The breakfast menu was limited and there were no fruit plates.  

Ok place to go if you want booze and don't really care what is in your omlet."}
{"text":"Nick's is a casual diner that takes you back a few decades. My college newspaper editor friends and I would hang out there after stressful deadlines for greasy food, pie and drinks. My memory is that the mood was smoky and the decor saturated with dull greens and dark browns. There is a nostalgic feel there, like it's the last restaurant of its kind in the area, and has never ceased being a great meeting spot for an unpretentious group of friends."}
{"text":"Honestly, i hate to give Nick's a one star review.  I like the interior, and I like everything that it stands for.  It's one of the last unpretentious places left on State St. to get something to eat.

That being said, the food is overpriced and terrible.  $11 for a greek salad that looked like it came from a high school cafeteria?  Sorry, no thanks.  I'll go O.D. on ironic velvet paintings somewhere else."}
{"text":"I went to nicks for the first time last weekend - great sandwich, great fries, great service (the owner). I went back yesterday with two friends - great sandwich, great fries, great service (amelia). I love this place!"}
{"text":"I've been taken to Nick's (for pie and drinks) twice.  The odds of me suggesting a visit are virtually nil.

It's okay.  It's like the bar/rec room that your Uncle Ed decorated in the early 70s and never got around to updating.  

The music is okay.  The pie is pretty good (the cherry pie has a heavy cinnamon taste, which *I* liked, but you might not).  The drinks are good.  The service is okay--generally prompt, but not really friendly (and considering that there are usually only...6-10 people in the bar at any given time, I'd expect a little more smile and a little less grouchiness, but whatever).

Overall: Just okay.

BTW: While the restaurant/bar is wheelchair accessible, the bathrooms are not."}
{"text":"A relative of mine said to meet here.  I have lived here for a long time and never noticed the place.  Crazy.  Had the spinach quiche and it was truly delicious.  I guess it is a secret recipe.  We were pleasantly surprised and will return for more.  Thanks Nick's!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick early lunch. Service was great. Food was good. Had a steak pita sandwich that was very good. Three of us were happy. The burgers look like they are worth a try for sure. Owner was very friendly. Would give it 5 stars if I visit again and they are consistent. Nice place to stop and have a drink if your not wanting to eat also."}
{"text":"We had $20 in gift certificates from our insurance agency, so my husband and I decided to try this place last night.  It wasn't the worst meal I've ever had, but I'm definitely glad we only paid about $8 plus tip for it after using the certificates.

My husband really liked his fried fish sandwich and fries, but I was underwhelmed by the turkey melt.  The roasted turkey they used was good, but the wheat bread was soggy and the cheddar cheese was completely tasteless.  I might as well have ordered American--it had no bite to it at ALL.  I also didn't like the fries as much--husband said he thought they were \"double-fried\" or something, which is too much fry for me.

I had a glass of the sauvignon blanc, and that was good; my husband also really enjoyed his beer (bottles only, no draft, I heard a waitress telling another customer).  Our waitress was competent but seemed kind of overwhelmed and not very personable, which was particularly noticeable since the place was almost empty and she had, at most, one other table.

The decor was very nice, and the prices aren't BAD, but as noted, I'm glad I wasn't really paying my own money for that meal.  I have no desire to return."}
{"text":"Saturday lunch, ordered a traditional burger..DELICIOUS!  Requested well-done, which it was, but not tough, and tasty.  Served with a generous slice of tomato and nice piece of dark, leafy lettuce..and grilled onions, per my instructions.  All with a generous serving of fries.  Excellent service.  $9.44 without beverage.  Also I like to patronize this establishment on the occasional Tues. for lunch (hot meatloaf sandwich and mashed potatoes special smothered in gravy) and Thurs. for the hot turkey sandwich and mashed potatoes special with nonstop gravy.  One time I ordered dessert, a good-size thick piece of blueberry pie with whipped cream.  Back to basics on State Street.  Num!"}
{"text":"Fun evening at Nick's before the Jerry Seinfeld show at the Overture. Reservations were handled by Dino, even though we had a late addition - Dino was accommodating. Jack our server did a great job, kept things moving since he knew we were on a schedule. The ladies had reuben's and a veggie reuben (\"best ever\" she exclaimed). A patty melt was served as well. I had the fried perch dinner - and it was equally as good as the rest of the meals served to our table. The soup was an eclectic mix of flavors, apparently a greek house specialty - I'd highly recommend. I also enjoyed the perfectly boiled, whole potato drizzled with melted butter and parsley flakes - it was a delicious substitute for fries. Nick's is a \"State Street\" original that dates to 1959 - one thing for sure, nothing ever changes at Nick's - which, honestly, I applaud - that's what I like about the place. Genuine. Stop and visit Dino at Nick's Restaurant on State St, I believe you'll enjoy the quaint charm and genuine hospitality."}
{"text":"Amazing Food!
They have this burger that you can order with different meats, and chesses and stuff cooked inside and it is to die for. I would recommend it definitely!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy everything about this place. Classic feel - like stepping into a time machine set for 50's. Really good lunch menu & fantastic specials. Meatloaf and mashed - out of this world good.  Eat at the bar or big vinyl booth  - enjoyed spot on service and seems owner / family are hands on running the place. Nicks is what many places wish or try too hard to be - only better."}
{"text":"Went on a busy Friday night and was not disappointed. Cute, diner-ish decor and a very friendly staff that made it feel much more intimate. My boyfriend had a steak sandwich that he said was the best he'd had in Madison (and he is very, very picky about any type of steak). He ordered it rare and it came as expected, he said he would be happy with that steak on its own had it come that way. I had the Greek salad, and it was prepared wonderfully. Perfect light dressing. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars was I thought the salad was small for the price (a dollar more than the steak sandwich and quite small), and the chicken was just a TAD dry. Otherwise, great service and great experience. Will go back!"}
{"text":"Love it. Every town needs a cool, but unassuming place where a man can get a decent drink and sit alone at the bar with a frown without worrying about it."}
{"text":"Order a turkey sandwich and you'll get turkey that the cooks baked themselves, not some store-bought cold cuts from a plastic bag. The pies and the soups and EVERYTHING is home-made and simply wonderful, which provides ones culinary experience with a decided old-schoolness that meshes well with the decor. My only complaint: the severe lack of vegetables, whether on sandwiches or as sides. Reminds me of the places Grandpa used to take me after fishing. Classic like downtown Vegas, but without the cacophony that is kryptonite to your hangover anyway."}
{"text":"I did not have a good experience here.  I came on a Sunday morning with the intention of ordering breakfast but after looking at the short breakfast menu decided a Reuben might be a better option.   The sandwich came with fries and coleslaw.  My partner ordered the gyro with fries.  Our food took over 40 min to arrive.  

At the 35 min mark I asked the waiter how much longer out food would take would take and she said it will be right out. What she didn't know is that I had seen her cutting my sandwich 10 min prior and just letting it sit there.  When my sandwich came out it was soaking wet.  The bread was inedible.  I had to take the few pieces of meat out of the bread and eat it by itself.  My fries were soaked in oil and the coleslaw had a ton of water in it.  The entire is experience left a bad taste in my month. Literally.

The service was no better. I never received an apology regarding our wait time. Also the place seemed a bit dingy. 

I have no desire to ever step foot in here again."}
{"text":"I love Nick's. It's one place on State Street that the grown-ups have left. The decor is hideous but charming and it's never crowded. If you're looking for a good dive downtown, this is it."}
{"text":"I was in town on business and was strolling down the street and thought I'd pop in for some traditional American food. Tuesday is meatloaf night, which is major comfort food. Very good stuff, meaty without being too dense. Juicy without falling to pieces. Nice onion gravy and warm rolls. Warm baklava for dessert. 
The decor is straight out of the eighties. Took a star off for the Sting album playing most of the time I was here."}
{"text":"I have been coming here my whole life and it is one of those places that you will always remember.  It has changed very little in the last 30 years except I think it has had a few different owners.  Nick's is a classic Greek diner with nicer dinner options (steak, fish fry, a few Greek dishes, etc).  The food is always solid and straight down the middle.  I always have the basics (burger or a turkey sandwich) and they are totally fine.  Nick's feels like you stepped back into the 50s and I appreciate that the owners decided to keep alive what is one of the coolest interiors in the US."}
{"text":"I live in Austin now. 

If you live in Austin, I urge you to read the other reviews of this place to know why the Belmont is a traveshamockery of everything good and pure in this world.

Nick's Restaurant, \"Home of Good Food\", is everything good and pure in this world. I worked there off and on in my early twenties as a cook with people who are now probably dead or retired (sans gold watch), and smiled even though life gave them little reason to. 

It looks like Dino runs the joint now; I worked for his dad, Aristides, who took over when Nick died in '73. 

Back in the day, it was the same pocket of a time-warped restaurant that it is now. You didn't tell everyone you knew about Nick's, because some of them wouldn't \"get it\", and they would just tarnish the times for those who did: cab drivers, grad students, retired govt clerks, professors...

I can't add anything more about the pies, drinks and food to augment the other reviews. 

But, I can suggest you go in there on a freezing cold Madison evening, sit at the bar and order a Stoli Gimlet, put a coin in the jukebox and press 1-6-5, and stare out that big plate glass window at the wet, black night, and become unstuck in time."}
{"text":"Came here for a bite to eat while visiting the Capitol and UW campus. The sign outside sad \"Hot Turkey Sandwich Special\", which drew my attention (I'm a sucker for Turkey Sandwiches). 

It's a surprisingly cozy restaurant with a bar / diner-esq feeling. We came for a pretty late lunch and it was not crowded at all. The waitress was very nice and seated us immediately.

We got the Turkey Sandwich, the Capitol Club (Turkey, ham, bacon triple decker), and a Gyro. The Turkey sandwich tasted like Thankgiving on a plate :), which was good and the portions were huge. The Club sandwich was huge and very filling. The Gyro was mediocre at best. Small portion and not very good. 

Overall, good place. I did find the bathroom to be unappealing, so I would probably save the trips for after the meal. I also found a hair in my sandwich (it could be my own... I'm not sure and didn't really mind)."}
{"text":"Dewar's with soda and lemon, please.

There's a stocked pie carousel at the end of the bar, and a painting of a velvet castle that makes me think of El Club Dumas.

Show up on a regular basis, and Dino's bound to hook you up with some free drinks."}
{"text":"Husband and I ate here before a show at the Orpheum. I had the fried Haddock special. Got plenty of food. Fish was pretty good. Dinner rolls tasted fresh; nice and soft. Boiled potato was tasty in its pool of butter. The Greek lemon soup was okay, not my favorite thing but it was alright. Husband liked his chicken sandwich.

I loved the decor of the place. The pattern on the booths was awesome and they were playing some old black and white shows on a TV. I wish the music being played would have gone with the decor. 

We would maybe stop again."}
{"text":"Got to love the decadent combination of pie and bourbon.  

I came here after a concert at Overture on Thursday night. It was surprisingly empty, yet had the warm welcome feeling. Think of Plaza; it's \"homey\" in that way. 

A waitress greeted me and my date in very pleasant way, and we sat down at one of the booths (love the booths). We ordered warm cherry pie and a sniffer of Knob Creek. The pie had the perfect amount of slightly tart cherry - ah, what more do you want after a great concert? They also have blueberry, pecan, cream pie, and all the other staples. It's not the best pie in the midwest, but does the job to make you purr."}
{"text":"Quite good restaurant for a number of reasons. Nice atmosphere and lighting, and very well made food. Their steaks are reasonably priced and cooked just as you ask, their coffee is good quality. They have a friendly serving staff who are quick as well.

Their Friday fish fry is amazing. Try it."}
{"text":"Nick's is not a haven for vegetarians.   The wood-paneled interior is most certainly Wisconsin supper club circa 1955, and that's how it should be.   I keep coming back for the drinks -- they make a grasshopper that is more mint shake than booze... and it's amazing. (and in general I'm a fan of booze)"}
{"text":"I love pretty much everything about this. 
Atmosphere. 
Staff.
The institution that it is. 
And you have no idea where the kitchen is but one of the best grilled corned beef sandwiches of my life made it's way to our table. (of. my. life.)"}
{"text":"This is my buddy's college town and favorite dive. We had outside seating in the summer, server was super new, food was bland, beer selection is uninspired. Location on State Street and history is all this place has going for it but I guess it's all it needs."}
{"text":"I still love you, Nick's. Your spanikopita is SO nice, along with a bottle of Rocky's Revenge and the last half of The Empire Strikes Back on the telly... :3 

One of these days I need to get one of those Grasshoppers."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink before a show at the Overture. I can't believe I have never been in this place! It is so cute. I've only heard great things about it but I have never eaten there myself. There were quite a few people there at the tables for dinner and some people eating at the bar. Walking inside is like being transported to another time. It's old school inside and I love it. The service was excellent and it was a great atmosphere. I definitely plan on coming back for dinner sometime and updating my review. Such a cute little spot that you wouldn't expect on State Street! If you haven't been here before, check it out. It's worth it just to stop by."}
{"text":"So, Nick's is a place I went a lot in my late 20's and early 30's.  It was the kind of place you can get a burger and a drink for a nice price.  I have not been here much of late since I don't work near State Street any more.

Me and two pals were heading to a show at the Overture Hall the other night and were looking for a dinner spot.  We didn't want to spend a lot of money but we didn't want fast food.  Nick's came to mind.

Nick's has the same interior it had when I was there last.  A bit dated, a bit worn.  But the booths are still comfortable.  The space was lit better than I remember which is good for reading the menu.  The interior could scare folks off who have never eaten there before.

One friend ordered the spinach pie and the other two of us had the steak sandwich.  The sandwich I had was on a soft roll and the size of the steak was just a touch bigger than the roll.  It was cooked just the way I wanted it done.  It is really hard to find a steak sandwich like this anywhere else in the city unless you are going to this type of old school joint.  We all enjoyed our meals.

Go to Nick's for a solid dinner choice."}
{"text":"This place, like the Memorial Union, is old-school, well-preserved and very much alive. The guy running the place was friendly and the waitress was adorable.  When I asked her who the Billie Holiday-ish singer we were listening to was, they both knew the answer (some French name I should've written down), and she brought out the CD!  Usually when I ask restaurant employees what music they're playing, they don't know and they don't know why I'm asking.

I started with a side salad and was impressed that the lettuce was actually green!  My entree was a turkey sandwich, which came with their \"special sauce\".  I was afraid it would be mayonazey, which it was, but it worked well with the crisp lettuce and turkey on the pumpernickel bread (my choice).  It was good!  The fries were nice-sized and crunchy on the outside. Next time I'm in Mad-town, I'll try to stop back through."}
{"text":"Tried the fish fry. I went with the perch but was pretty disappointed. The fish did not seem fresh and did not have a great taste. On top of that, 2 of the filets had bones in them, which was pretty unpleasant. 

The soup I had with the meal was terrible and the side of potatoes was very plain. Did not finish either of them (or the fish, for that matter).

The service was good and the decor was fun. I just wish the food was better."}
{"text":"Nick's was pretty great and was an unexpected fun Friday night. We stopped in because we had heard they have great Greek food, but what we also found was a cozy supper club-esque place right on State Street. 

To drink, I got a glass of the house red, but they also offer Greek selections that are the same price as the house wines, in addition to some higher priced wines. My house red was $6 and pretty solid. 

I opted for the fish fry, which was decent, but the real winner of the night was the avgolemono soup. It was so so tasty and creamy, and it came with the dinner! 

It was bustling with people when we showed up around 7, but most of them cleared out by the time we were done dinner. They were having some sort of celebration that night with a competition to win free champagne. Our waitress was telling us about it and was very friendly. 

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Some items on the menu are edible if you want an inexpensive lunch, but otherwise I usually steer clear of this place. It usually feels a bit dirty. The drinks, while priced well, are usually a bit weak. I have rarely had good service here, and it is the type of place I would visit if I wanted a Wal-Martesque ego boost.

However, I never feel the need to observe sad people to feel better about myself. I suggest moving up the block in either direction. There are too many great places on State Street to make Nick's part of your repertoire."}
{"text":"Big props for making a turkey club with fresh, not processed, turkey.  With a lot of diners, this one has Greek origins but I don't love the Greek dishes here.  Food is good but not great and is a little overpriced for a diner.  Decor is is classic diner/supper club."}
{"text":"The Old Yeller of restaurants (minus the rabies), Nick's is my go-to place if I'm looking for a quick dinner on State St.  Cheap prices, friendly service, decent food, full bar.  They never disappoint mostly because I don't expect too much.  Some might say the decor could use an update but I think it's part of the charm."}
{"text":"Super lunch! Lemon soup, spinach pie and gyro were just what we needed. Old city charm you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Nick's is my go-to for before the show drinks whenever I am attending an event at the Overture or Orpheum. It's a great little spot to pop into and usually not too crowded. It's definitely a dive, so know that going in, but don't let it sway you. 

I've never eaten there, however, the past couple times I've been in the food has smelled incredible and the plates I've seen looked great. 

The bathrooms leave much to be desired, but that's whatever. Get in, get out, you'll be fine. 

Tonight was a great night to sit outside, however when we arrived the seats outside were totally full. It was beautiful outside so that made sense. Inside, unfortunately, it was crazy hot. Uncomfortably hot. I heard someone (presumably Nick) telling a server that there was something wrong with the ac unit so that would lead me to believe the warm situation was not normal. 

Either way, I'll be back. I love the old school decor and throwback feeling you when walking in the door. Service is usually decent and drinks are poured generously. Check it out!"}
{"text":"We came here during St. Patrick's Day so  that was probably our mistake but 1.5 hour waiting at our table for two sandwiches and one was the corned beed special. Overpriced sandwich--I was close to asking giving me the meat and bread and I can make the sandwich myself."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite before Chen Yun at the Overature last night. Just ordered an appetizer to split. 
Kalamata Olives & Feta plate. Came with 2 pita's, sliced into 4 pieces each, 4 slices of cucumber with Roma tomato on top, a small handful of olives, and four chunks of Feta. The entire app was drizzled with EVOO. Not the best EVOO, but what do ya want from a place that's kitchen is about the size of my bathroom? 
The olives were outstanding. Some of the best we've had.  The Feta was salty and delish.
All in all, pretty good."}
