{"text":"One of the best places I have ever ate. They make homemade Pretzel Sandwiches and they are beyond amazing. They have a small store down the road where you can purchase their lunch meats and cheeses, as well as other products and baked goods. If you are in the area do yourself a favor and stop by for a sandwich!"}
{"text":"Great tasty treats.  Good: nice selection of sweet food.  Freshly made.  Con: Cash only.  they don't accept credit cards.     I like their apple walnut bread.  I loved it so much that I want to eat the whole loft every single day.  Well of course, in reality, I only eat 3 slides per day because I care about my weight."}
{"text":"Good bakery located in Bainbridge Ohio . The staff is friendly. Is delicious. The price is very reasonable considering everything is homemade here. It is a little out of our way but to me it is really worth it."}
{"text":"WOW---best bakery ever!  My husband and I stopped at Country Crust Bakery during a recent road-trip and we were amazed at the selection of items they had available.  Everything... donuts, cakes, pies, breads, turnovers, muffins, whoopie pies, honey, made to order sandwiches and pizza, and beverages.  Then there were the pretzels....  Within a span of less than 24 hours I had eaten two (they're pretty big!) of my own and half of one of my husband's and I also purchased some to take home and freeze.  The woman at the counter kindly wrapped them individually in plastic wrap for me, too!  The smell of the bakery nearly put me into a sugar coma, as did the delicious pumpkin bars with cream cheese frosting!    I live about an hour and a half from the bakery and will definitely be returning to restock my freezer with their delicious goodies!    YUM!!!"}
{"text":"I used to live near this bakery and visited their store at least once a week for several years.  The building is small and run entirely by the Amish. You will not find better products anywhere!  The apple fritters are absolutely wonderful. The homemade pretzels are worth every penny.. so make sure you get there early enough that they aren't sold out. Whoopie pies are great, in every flavor.  I have no complaints on anything they have there. I've bought it all.. from butter to pizzas to pretzels. You absolutely HAVE to try the pretzels if you don't try anything else. Around the holidays the fruitcake cannot be beat. It's not like any you've ever had.  This is a wonderful place to get great homemade baked goods."}
{"text":"I have had a sampling of most everything there is to offer from the bakery and it is all delicious. My favorite is of course the fresh baked pretzels. All the other items I don't particularly care for and think most of the breads are over priced. They increase prices a lot here. But I will always come back for a box of those pretzels."}
{"text":"Best homemade goodies around. Highly recommend the pretzel sandwiches. They are worth any wait."}
