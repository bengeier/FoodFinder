{"text":"I've been here several times in the last year, why can't they keep employees? Every time you go in, they have almost a whole new staff. The young girl who claims to be the manager, wears booty shorts, because that's professional. Maybe if the turnover wasn't so crazy, you could actually have a consistent experience at this place. This last time will be the last. No coffee refills, no smiles, nobody every checked on us, had to ask for the bill, and the food presentation which has always been excellent, was seriously lacking. Hopefully they can pull it together."}
{"text":"Great food ! The place is small and usually packed, plan ahead. It's breakfast and lunch only"}
{"text":"My husband and I drove across town to try this place out. Sadly it was not worth it. The staff is too casual when you come in. They sat us all the way in the back, there was no one in the restaurant. In the middle of the restaurant is the server station to fill up sodas, where most of the servers gathered to chat. The food was honestly nothing special. I would compare I to IHOP."}
{"text":"Eat there regularly on Sunday mornings, very extensive brkf menu & very tasty food. For good service I always ask for Jessica who is very professional, friendly & fun to joke around with like one of the guys. She is very thorough when it comes remembering your order & bringing it just the way I ordered it, with every detail spot on."}
{"text":"Trying to find a quick breakfast place in Vegas is always a challenge.  We were debating on Mimi's Cafe, Eggworks and Egg & I.  All seems really good...but we wanted something quick and easy.  We always passed by The Griddle, but never got a chance to eat there till last week.  

They have a seating for outside and a decent size inside.  The two individuals that gave us drinks and refilled them were really nice.  I ordered the red velvet pancakes and my husband got the griddle platter.  He loved it; and mentioned it was not greasy at all.  I also loved my red velvet pancakes...they were really moist.  I liked how it had powered sugar and chocolate syrup.  I wished I was able to just used the chocolate syrup instead of the pancake syrup.

It took some time to get our bill.  I guess because there was only 1 server.  I believe he was the owner?  He took the orders, caculated the bill and took the payments.  He probably needed 2 servers to get that place to turnover people really quick.  There was a line at one point to get people seated and to pay for their checks.

Overall, it was a good place, and we will return."}
{"text":"These guys server were the ultimate worst. I felt as though I was eating at Dick's Last Resort (which is famous for their intentional rude service)... The server was more interested in having a conversation with his friend at the table next to us. Wish the food tasted just as well as it smelled however my stomach requested that I stop eating and go chew on dirt to remove their taste from my mouth. Food is over priced. I also watched several servers load toast in the toaster and butter it w/o washing their hands first."}
{"text":"Let me just say worst service ever. Sorry would have wrote this sooner but couldn't get it to load properly. My husband and I visited stack and yolks on cheyenne and jones on Memorial Day. My fries were to crispy I  couldn't eat them, our drinks were gone about half way through our meal. Nobody checked back on us. And they had like 5 waiters on staff And they all kept walking past our table but not 1 person stopped And asked if we needed a refill or how everything was.  And I had to ask for the bill 3 different times. The cashier asked how everything was and i told her worst service ever we will never be back. She did apologize but that was all."}
{"text":"The staff was so sweet. Every one of them I spoke with was so pleasant, so this has nothing to do with them, but I wish everything else could have been even half as good. 
Walking in, the establishment is small, but clean. Sadly, the air is heavy with the smell of grease. I was there for only an hour and my hair and clothes stink like it now. There was a huge lip smudge on husband's glass. Looked like the cup had not been washed at all. 
We ordered french toast, biscuits and gravy, and some sort of chicken, mushroom, potato, and feta sauté that came with eggs and pita. The French toast was less than thrilling. Stereotypical Texas toast with hardly any egg even coating the outside of it, and was very dry. It came drowned in cinnamon and powdered sugar. I hate powdered sugar. There was so much I wondered what they had to hide under it. Also, the French toast had been carelessly cooked over what looked like drops of someone else's red velvet pancake batter. 
The biscuits were from a mix. Hard and dry like a desert.  The gravy was from a mix and hadn't even been made properly to hide the fact. It had no flavor beyond flour and msg.
The sautéed thing was burned in many places. Spinach over cooked, mushrooms rubbery, and the chicken pieces were smaller than a dime. The chicken tasted like it came preseasoned from a package  and didn't match the seasoning from the rest of the dish. Pita bread was over cooked on one side and doughy on the other. 
I love supporting small businesses, but this place was such a let down with the food and greasy smell that I honestly don't plan to even try it a second time. However, I wish the employees only good things because they were very good people."}
{"text":"No wait but it takes forever to get your food. Food is average, I ordered pancakes. Servers were nice but not attentive."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The only one really working seemed like the hostess that was trying to clean tables, seat people, cash people out, and bus. The servers were seriously super nonchalant about the fact that it was a busy restaurant. Food coming out was slow and nothing special at all. I used to be in the service industry and tip very well and left a 10% tip because I felt bad for the hostess and hope they give her something. People that serve/have served know that even with bad service you would usually give 15% and give people the benefit of the doubt on having a bad day or something but all around you can tell it was a bad operation."}
{"text":"After driving by Stacks & Yolks for years I decided to give the a go.  The staff was pleasantly serving guests & all the food looked & smelled delicious.  1st impression all good.
  The restaurant was extremely busy, so waiting was not a problem and expected since it was NOON on a Sunday.  It took 10  minutes for a table, the table was cleaned up quickly however not thoroughly (still sticky in area's and when you serve pancakes you must be more careful to wipe with a clean hot towel), when the table was wiped all the crumbs fell on the chairs which were left there for us to shake off.  It took 20 minutes to put in our order, the food took over 40 minutes to prepare (It may have taken longer had I not asked about it after 30 minutes of waiting).  The staff were kind & helpful after getting their attention, so I excused the slow service to the volume knowing how you can get a major rush from time to time since I use to be in the restraint business for 13 years.  However the servers lacked the skills of acknowledgement & communication to us \"their customers\" which is especially crucial when you are busy & people are waiting a long time.   Leaving people wondering & hanging is the worst thing you can do!!  
 After 1 hour + the food was delivered.  The pancakes the kids ordered all looked great, my mom's food looked comsi comsa.  I ordered the Chef's special Corned beef hash (which is my favorite & it's one of the most expensive things on the menu and the menu, the description made it sound sensational.  Presentation was 1 out of 5 and when I tried to cut into the golf ball sized corned beef chunks I realized it was all fatty & grisly (not little cube pieces as normal), so I got the attention of manager came over and offered to exchange it for something else and he did.  I went with the chorizo egg special which was very tasty (yet only had traces of chorizo...3 or 4 very small penny size pieces).  The only reason I gave a 2 star instead of 1 was that the 2nd order received literally was prepared in 2 minutes (all breakfast cafe's should be able to provide quick table turnover because volume is everything).  Unfortunately this was the 1st & last time I will dine here.  If I am ever in the southwest part of town again.........Egg Works will be my choice since they provides a consistent quality & great service every time I have gone.  I am taking the time to write this, not to bash them (in fact this is amongst one of my only negative reviews & experiences dining out in years).  Hopefully help Stacks & Yolks will take this feedback to improve their service & food quality for all their future clientele & to keep their existing customers happy."}
{"text":"The First and it will be my last time here. It wasn't busy and we waited 30mins for 1 pancake,2 eggs,and 2bacon. And it wasn't hot. It was the WORST red velvet pancake I ever had. It was big,hard, and touch to swallow. The environment had a weird vibe and The only thing that was quick was Sam picking up the her tip. The reason for the 1 Star is when we told the busboy about how Disappointed we were in the pancakes he laughed and said I know,  I heard they taste like rubber now. 

It was funny in the moment but then I started thinking about paying full price for something that they are very aware of that's not good. So I'm saying NO to the Stacks and YES to the Yolks"}
{"text":"You now the first time I went to the Griddle, I was semi-pleased. It was the second and third time that got me fed up! For service: I have to say its a 50/50. They're service is very unproductive, they almost have no professionalism and knowledge to what the waitstaff need to say or do. The very first waitress that we had was very pleasant, but the second and third time sucked ass. We had to ask for this and that too many times. The food is also inconsistent, the third time I went I ordered \"Griddle combo or something like that\". I asked for fruit instead of the house hash for $1. So when it came, it was incorrect and the portion size were so small. Here's an example, house hash, mushrooms,spinach, onions, and chicken. Portions came out in that order and there was literally 4 pieces of chicken that were the size of croutons . Pathetic! For $10.   VERY OVERRATED. Just order pancakes and that's it, otherwise you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Servers were friendly and helpful.. food great. lemon -blueberry pancakes are awesome."}
{"text":"I was not a fan of this place. We had the corn beef hash, biscuits and gravy and blueberry pancakes. The food was mediocre at best. We were sat by the door on a windy day and it was very cold and everything was blowing all over the place and nothing was done to keep the door shut. I can make a better breakfast at home."}
{"text":"Delicious food and awesome servers. It's a nice home feeling and everyone is so nice. Try their red velvet pancakes it will melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the five stars. The only reason why it gets three stars is because the staff is great and so is the service. I'm a firm believer in that just because you get big portions of something that it doesn't necessarily mean it is good. Big portions does not replace good food and quality of ingredients."}
{"text":"This joint looked like it was good but unless you wanna wait 45 minutes to get a seat and 30 more for your food by all means this is your kinda place it's smelled like burn grease in there when I left I smelled like I've been working over a hot stove for 12 hours straight but that's just my opinion"}
{"text":"This was supposed to be my first time here heard about the place from mt family and \"tge best of Las Vegas\". We got the drinks fast but when we were ready to order the waiter was no where to be found. I hate to walk out of a restaurant but THE SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE NEVER COMING BACK!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time at Stacks & Yolks on Durango. I was not sure what to expect especially since it was a smaller restaurant but I'm always on the hunt for amazing pancakes. The staff greeting us upon entering from every section of the restaurant. We sat down and we were handed menus promptly. The staff had energy and worked amazingly together. Our server Talia was phenomenal. She was attentive and answered questions. I always walk into restaurants wondering if I would come back and almost instantly I knew it was one of my new favorite places. Major kudos to Talia, Brandon, and Allen for making us feel welcomed. You are one of the best teams I had the pleasure of being waited on by. We usually compare our servers to the ones on Disney Cruise Line and without hesitation I felt like this was one of those teams."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast I knew it would be busy considering it's a Saturday. I waited for about 20 mins no problem. Food and server were great. However, checks took almost 25 mins to be passed out. A young aggressive, female cashier stood in front of me in time to pay my bill. She was speaking on the phone the whole time during our 6 minute encounter.  Which makes it 26 minutes to pay my bill, more time than it took to eat. I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EARS... She was criticizing the waitstaff in front of everyone standing close by to register. 

Do you not want my money? Poor management. Taking the payment is the last memory a guest should have and she really put a poor taste in my mouth. My poor server was stretched thin running inside and out to be talked about in plain view of customers. The servers and cooks really seem to make this place run. Management owes them BIG $"}
{"text":"Hostess -pink ponytail- friendly great with greetings and farewells

Server - looks like Odell Beckham Jr- friendly , answer my questions honestly and was knowledgeable 

Busser - looked sketchy needs a uniform, poor set ups missing utensils etc.

Management - didn't see in floor

This place is pretty busy in the mornings we had a 30min wait for 3ppl. No problem, but you do have to wait outdoors so wear a jacket.

Once sat the server greeted and brought drinks very timely. Food comes out pretty fast as well and it was delicious . 
My issues were , being my first visit I had to wait over 15 mins after being severed my food to receive a fork so I could eat, ridiculous. Second was a hair in my friends food but the server did immediately replace it with no problem 
If this wasn't my first experience I would give 3 stars but the blew it for a first time guest who yelps."}
{"text":"Love this place! We go 2x a month and bring all our family when they are in town! Everyone loves it! Great friendly service! Today we called ahead to reserve a spot with our large party we arrive and the young lady wearing green contacts at the check in stand never put our name down and gave us the worst service and attitude ever! We decided to take our business else where.. Very disappointing!!!! She should not be working with the customers with such a bad attitude!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I were just here for breakfast.  He was there yesterday and enjoyed his bacon pancakes so much he brought me back today - lucky me!

We were warmly greeted by the owner and as we sat down the nicest lady came by and took our drink order.  Fresh coffee and filtered ice water were brought right up. While trying to decide what I wanted I kept seeing plate after plate of delectable pancakes being delivered to other patrons.  Our waitress came by a couple of minutes later and I asked her what she recommended.  She recommended the lemon blueberry pancakes and I was sold!  I ordered a short stack (2 huge cakes) and made it a combo ( 2 eggs and 2 pieces of bacon or sausage) for $2.99 more.

It was packed but the service didn't reflect that - everyone was friendly and our coffee cups and water were refilled without having to ask.

Our pancakes came up about 15 minutes later.  They were huge and fluffy with the perfect amount of lemon and fresh blueberries.  They were so good they didn't even need syrup or butter.  Perfectly cooked eggs over easy and two strips of crisp bacon were served separately.  In hindsight I should have only ordered the pancakes.  I could only eat half of them.  Our server and the sweet lady that took our drink order came by to check on us throughout.  I am already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Went in around 12:30 on a saturday. Ordered our food quickly, waited over 35 minutes for our food after ordering and ended up leaving without eating. People that came in after us got their food before us, and by watching the kitchen it looked like they weren't anywhere near completing our order.  Disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Last time we were here was not a very good experience, but we decided to give them another chance. This visit was much better, the service was far superior this time, the staff was friendly and attentive. My food was good, hot, and correct. No wait either, walked right in and was seated, as a family of 4 we usually have to wait. The pancakes are big enough to share so my kids shared a cinnamon pancake and my wife and I had skillets. The price was reasonable, though we only drink water which helps lower costs. We will definitely return again."}
{"text":"If you are hungry...go somewhere else. We were seated right away, mind you it was just the two of us, but the food took a long time to come out. When it finally arrived it was mediocre at best. Definitely won't be back, there are far better breakfast places around."}
{"text":"Good food but terrible service.  Waited about 15 minutes for wait staff to take order after seating.  Bill was high by $15 as they charged us 3 times for 1 meal.  They did correct it but should have never made that mistake.  Will just stay with ihop in the future."}
{"text":"I have to say...the service there is horrible. I kept hearing commercials on the radio about it and I figured since I'm in the area I'll try it out. Wow...very disappointing. I waited almost 10 minutes to be seated and it was only half full. There we're plenty of tables I could've seated myself at. It then took another 10 min to get a cup of coffee, when the waiter showed up to finally take my order...I heard, 'you weren't my table.' Yikes...I hope whoevers table I was doesn't work there anymore. I don't want to sound like a complainer, because I'm not, but this place needs to stepup their service. Idk if I'll come back. I probably won't. The food was fair and lukewarm. I think I was doomed from the time I walked through the door."}
{"text":"Great food and casual environment that's our first time  here for lunch we had Humburguer and iced tea our server Chris wad very friendly and attention to details we will most definitely come back again and bring our family and friends"}
{"text":"I LOVE red velvet! Here they make the most delicious red velvet pancake! The hot chocolate is delicious and the hash browns too. And the staff is professional & friendly."}
{"text":"Tried it once a few months back, food was OK, service not so much.
2nd try - DONE!! Waited over 30 minutes for our food. When it came there was no toast. Told it would be right up. Meal 80% finished & still no toast - excuses galore but  NO excuse for bad service all around. 2 cooks, a lot of water pourers, silverware set up people, an order taker - BAD all around!!
The name change will not make up for terrible service."}
{"text":"First off, the food is great. Maybe better. However, it wouldn't be worth it to go back. The person who we assume was the manager on duty, was unapologetic and less than pleasant to his waitstaff. While we were seated quickly, we waited quite a while for our order to be taken. Once it was, it was around 45 more minutes whilst we waited for our food (we're talking pancakes here). In that time, we had five different servers, did not receive the water we requested until the third time, and were notified about 40 minutes in that what our daughter ordered was not available today (not that they just ran out, but our first server neglected to tell us). Finally, we were all served, and it was delicious. However, while we did not ask for a comp, some sort of gesture would have been nice. When we went to pay, we overheard our server approaching the person we assumed was the manager to ask to provide an orange juice to another family that had similar waiting issues. He indicated, \"No, we don't do comps...they have to pay if they want anything,\" then told her to go check on her tables in a dismissive way. I think we found the problem.
Great food, but one can get great food many places that somehow manage to treat their customers and teams well. That was not demonstrated on this particular Wednesday morning. Sigh..."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday and were able to sit right away. Took several minutes before we got menus but the order time was quick. We each ordered the Garden Skillet which was good. The biscuits and gravy were quite good as well. Service was lacking. Our drinks were never refilled and they forgot toast for one of our orders. Server never checked on us. They comped us the coffee and said it was the guy's first day working there. Not sure if that was true or not but it seems like a recurring theme there regardless. Perhaps it was an off day but I don't know if I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Really good place! Feels more like a home meal. The food was great. The service was great once you look past how funny the people speak, the cup of coffee was not empty once! The price is the same or better then IHOP. I will be back to this place."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time the other day and I can't say enough about this place.  Yes it's crowded but worth the wait.  Food was great, even the coffee was good and I never order coffee in a restaurant.  Service and the workers are so pleasant.  Freddie was our waiter and he was great. I would definitely go again and I'm coming from Henderson."}
{"text":"First time here as we have been wanting to try it out because it's right by our house. The waitress said the special of the day was loco moco and that it was very good, hamburger patty over white sticky rice and few eggs on top. Being a regular white sticky rice eater this sounded pretty good to me.

When the food runner brought my order it was a carne asada skillet and I said that wasn't what I ordered, he said \"YOU must have been confused because this is the special.\" I explained to him that, no I wasn't confused and he needs to check with the one who took the order. They took it back and started on my order. By the time she brought my order, my family was finished  eating. 

Was pretty hungry at this point and just glad to get the food. That excitement quickly ended when I took my first bite. Scrambled egg on top was ok, it's hard to mess that up, hamburger patty was decent but gravy was bland. However the rice, which to me is the main part of this dish because everything is on top of it, was just bad. Sticky rice doesn't mean it should be like mash potatoes, too much water and no taste. My daily white rice eaters would agree. After a few bites I couldn't even eat it. Just wanted the check so we could get leave. 

When I got the check, I see that this hamburger patty/egg over white rice was more than anything on their menu, even more than the steak. How is that? And this is the special? Now I knew why the waitress was so eager to say it was so good. 

I would have gave it one star but my son liked his happy face pancake. 

I still tipped because I'm in the hospitality business but very disappointed in service and taste.  After all, you only get one chance to make a first impression. It's too bad because it's by the house and we really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great food! My number one choice for breakfast anytime I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has such a huge following?! Every single table was full and others waiting... on a Wednesday at 1p. 

It took us a while to get our order taken but the gentleman waiting tables was working VERY hard and was quite sweet...with a funny sense of humor. He was workin' his bootie off but maintained a positive attitude and smile. The waitress on duty wasn't working as hard but was stunningly beautiful... maybe she is why the resturant was so packed? The employee tshirts are super cute and available for purchase. 

The food was the lowlight... yikes!  I got a tuna melt that had a weird wet and mushy consistency... and a bizarre sweetness to it?! It was definitely made from the cheapest tuna available... at least I hope that was tuna!. I could barely eat half. Good french fries tho... and decent ranch. My daughter ordered a grilled cheese sandwich from the kids menu. It came on big, thick french toast bread. It tasted like powered sugar?! It was so greasy and odd tasting. She could only eat 2 bites. The flies buzzing around the table seemed to like it tho?!

We paid 19 bucks for two inedible sandwiches... always a bummer to leave a resturant hungry. I give praises to our waiter tho as he was polite and kind from beginning to end."}
{"text":"I can't seem to get out of this place in a reasonable amount of time. Staff is very friendly and food is good but don't come here if you're on a time crunch. We waited at the door for a solid 5-10 before we were even acknowledged and told we could sit down. No greeter, is this seat yourself or? We had no idea. Finally got sat then waited another solid 5-10 to even get menus. 1 of the 2 servers taking care of the full restaurant apologized and finally got our order in. We probably waited 20-25 for our food and I only got half my order. My pancakes came out when my company had already finished her food so I took it to go. This has become the norm. I really want to keep coming back but each visit makes it more difficult to find reasons to."}
{"text":"My wife wanted to go to this place for months and we delayed  it for various reasons. Well today was the   big day and we decided to finally go for breakfast here. The potatoes were overcooked  and tasted funny like they've been cooked in old oil. I had scrambled eggs that were also overcooked and even a little burned in other words, they weren't fluffy and moist as scrambled eggs should be. The bacon was greasy   and not crispy. I think that any casino buffet can make breakfast then this lace for half the price."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic brunch/breakfast spot! My wife and son don't eat traditional breakfast food, and they ate very well."}
{"text":"So here is a review for another neighborhood breakfast restaurant...
I should say we have tried almost all within 3-4 mile range and Original HOP is still a champ with Mr. Mamas coming in second.

Stacks and Yolks... neither your Stacks nor Yolks were good enough to get a good rating. 

Yolks: ordered scrambled med/soft and sunny side up... both came out done wrong.
Scrambled was all browned up (which is immediate turn off) and sunny side was fried hard on a bottom. I understand that we all want our food fast but it still has to be cooked right and I don't mind waiting a few extra minutes for that

Stacks: ordered french toast which turned out to be rather dry and chewy - not good.
Pancakes were OK... but honestly they could make them smaller there is no need to waste so much food. 

Bacon... looked like a post-nuclear strike atrocity. 

Overall: not going back, unless they give food for free. Service was spotty, drinks were only refilled after waving and asking. Dining area is cramped and it is difficult to get in between tables."}
{"text":"My family and I go here all the time now and we love it. Food is great and the service is good. I read some of the bad reviews and I didn't understand them.  Someone was mad that there was butter in everything?  Really? I work in the restaurant business and this place is clean as a busy place can be. Elvis pancakes are amazing by the way:)"}
{"text":"Just wanted to try it out... soo NOT worth going.. service was poor, we were the only people in the restaurant besides a family of 3.  We had to ask for everything, the server didn't serve  us at all.. very disappointing."}
{"text":"My husband and I had breakfast yesterday morning. Staff was very friendly. Was fairly quick on taking our order.
I ordered the lemon blueberry pancake with scrambled eggs and bacon. My husband had an omelet with turkey sausage, tomato and cheese.
The pancake was fluffy with a good amount of blueberries and lemon flavor. Would get again. Eggs were well cooked, not over done. Bacon crispy. Hubby said the omelet was good. 
I would have given them 5 stars but the food was only a little warm. They seems to have plenty of servers so I don't understand how the food didn't get to us still hot. 
We were on a time limit that morning or I would have sent it back. 
But even it being a little warm the food was tasty. 
I will be willing to give them one more try."}
{"text":"tried this place while in vegas and it was so good I came back the next day. great food, great service"}
{"text":"Loved the food...I had pancakes and corned beef hash...will be coming here from now on!"}
{"text":"Worst deal ever,showed up for breakfast at 10:20 am Sunday was told it would be a 10 or 15 minute wait at 10:45 am a party of 6 walked in at got sat down,we were told reservations were called in so they were getting seated first, no problem waiting,however you should have a sign ,stating reservation will be honored over guest waiting ,in line, I will never eat at that establishment. Lost my buisness,and everyone I know.wow glad that others that were waiting behind us left as well so 8 customers you lost at once.... wait a waste of my time. Left there and went to Jamms much better choice took me 12 minutes to get here and waited 6 minutes already seated....hmm mm imagine what it's like to have good service"}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Close to my house and and my girl loves ihop for some dumb reason. Got 2 big meals for about 10$ less the IHOP well worth it.  Will ho back"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! The portions were way bigger than we expected and the prices were great. Service was very slow, but the staff was very friendly. We think they should offer a sampler platter so you can try all the different pancakes! There's too many to choose from!"}
{"text":"This place seems to be always busy and packed but I will never return there, so sorry about the 1 star. We waited over an hour to be seated here, normally we wouldn't wait but it seemed like such a popular place we wanted to give it a try. The restaurant is small and the tables are crammed together, we were seated in the front corner by the window but I still felt completely claustophonic, don't know why since I've been in smaller places. The service started out promptly with our drink order taken right away but after that I think the waiter forgot about us, we ended up having 5 different people waiting on us. After we flagged someone down to take our order it took about 45 mins to get our food, all I ordered was bacon and eggs and my partner ordered the chorizo scramble, we thought that they forgot to put our order in so we flagged another wait staff down and asked about it, they went back to check but never came back to update us, our food came out about 10 mins later and I asked for some Cholula hot sauce. I waited and waited for that wait staffer to bring it while my eggs got cold and finally had to flag down one of the 4 wait staffer standing in the aisle chatting with each other to ask for it again. She brought a bottle out and left and seriously it was empty! I got out 2 drops, I flagged down another person and after a while he brought out 3 bottles that had only a few drops in it saying that they were having a shortage. And again, we had to flag down one of the wait staffer standing around for our check just so that we could get the heck out out of there 2 and a half hours later."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and friendly.  Prices reasonable and food very good.  I had Pancakes with eggs and bacon and it was a lot of food for the price.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Cheap prices!!!! I can't believe this place has been here for so long and I never eaten here. The service is good and the food is delicious! Way better than IHOP, Dennie's, and Egg works. Just make sure you get before 3pm."}
{"text":"I never write reviews. I didn't even have a yelp account so I created on so I could write this review. Ppl who came in after us were seated first. Food took a long time. Table of 5 ppl who were seated 10 mins after us got their food first. When food finally came out I was missing an egg and my girlfriend was missing a pancake. Food is good ya.. Could have been better with better service.. We almost walked out before food came.. We had enough time in between the time we ordered and the time it came to think about it"}
{"text":"Walked in and it was pretty busy, that's always a good sign.  Was shown a table and then was left alone for 20 minuets!  We had to ask for place settings and water and the tables and floor were a bit dirty.  I was about to say \"let's go\" when our server came and took our order.  I ordered the Red Velvet pancakes without strawberries and my friend ordered strawberry pancakes.  Our order came with eggs and hash browns and that was pretty good but the RV pancakes fell short on flavor.  
Overall, I think that I'll try a few more places before I head back to The Griddle."}
{"text":"The worst customer service/attentiveness I have ever seen in a restaurant. Watched two different persons whom work here spill coffee and food on customers. My wife and I we're sitting at a table without service for a good 30 minutes. No drinks or acknowledgement. Upon being through eating, we were not acknowledged at all for  another 45 minutes. Our own waitress walked by us about 20 times also. The best part, upon asking for our check and a box we got attitude. Great food but horrendous service. We will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast stops in town.  The staff is always friendly and the food consistently good.  This location is what some would call \"loved\", it isn't the newest building in town but I like it all the more because of it.  In a town full of glitz and gilding, Stacks and Yolks forgoes the glamour to focus on good food and friends."}
{"text":"I am happy to say the food was very good, but the service the second time going there hasn't changed from the first. The restaurant had a total of 6 patrons and we were seated  and waited for 8 minutes until I asked somehow who my server once, because the server was talking to ignoring us, same circumstance as the first visit. I am super dissapointed in the service, but the food is good. Customer service needs to get way better there though!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow,  the food was enormous and delicious definitely worth Coming here.  The customer service is great."}
{"text":"1. We had the red velvet pancakes with bananas and Adding a topping is $1. Second was chicken and waffle, and the crab cake Benedict. They all didn't taste that great

2. Staff was nice but inattentive. It took awhile to get their attention. Seems like most of the workers are new and need training regarding their menu."}
{"text":"Yummy Food and Friendly Staff. Brandon is awesome! Had the November Stacks combo with fresh squeezed oj.. Bomb.com Thanks B for the recommendation :)"}
{"text":"Just order the Always November Pancakes and jalapeño bacon and I'll promise you'll return. Can't speak for anything else on the menu but those two items would get me back there on the regular. Staff is friendly, menu appears to have something for everyone. Perfect place for a family breakfast outing with the kids. Also they serve fresh squeezed orange juice :)"}
{"text":"The food here are massive portions and delicious! My favourite was the Philly Cheesesteak skillet, they actually used really shaved steak for it! Plus, the red velvet pancakes is amazing too! I will be back for sure to try out other options!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here, we were visiting from Hawaii. The philly skillet was super ONO(DELICIOUS), the velvet pancakes were awesome, but what really stood out was the SERVICE by a server named BRANDON. He wasnt even our SERVER, and he helped us with our drinks and change for our meal. He was really hustling and on top of that had a fantastic personality. Coming from Hawaii we know hospitality when we see it! So shout out to BRANDON, thank you my braddah! Mahalo nui loa e STACKS & YOLKS!"}
{"text":"Went here Saturday around 9:30 am. There was no wait to be seated-- I would assume there were 4-6 open tables. The hostess is outside and before seating us at the closest table, she went in to see if there was a table further in the back so we wouldn't have to be near the door getting cold every time it was opened. That was nice of her. Overall, it is fairly small inside; you have to wait for servers to grab food at the bar and take it to the table before you can walk past, and we were close enough to the table next to us that we could bump elbows with the other patrons. This is the reason for 4 stars. Our server was not as personable as another waitress, but that doesn't bother me. She was quick to take our orders. OJ is fresh squeezed and contains plenty of pulp. Pancakes are as big as a large dinner plate, 2 of us could have split 1 pancake and been satisfied."}
{"text":"love this place. it's my go to for breakfast fun. the many offerings keeps my taste buds happy. personal favorite is the Monterey Skillet and Alabama Slamma."}
{"text":"Feeling adventurous, my hubby and I stopped by for brunch as we had not tried this eatery before. We were seated right away and almost every table was filled. The first impression for me was that it smells heavily of grease.  The menu is large, something for every taste. Our server was pleasant and attentive. It took 30 minutes for our food to arrive. We both ordered pancakes with combo deal of 2 eggs and bacon. The pancakes are huge, so a short stack of 2 cakes was more than enough for me. My order was correct, but my hubby's cranberry orange cakes arrived with blueberries instead of cranberries. Our over medium eggs were more like over easy, pretty loose.  Along with the cakes and eggs, we had one iced tea and a coffee and by the time we added a tip, we had a $40 breakfast. Note for the handicapped: there is not even one ADA compliant parking space here. There is, however, a curb cut out by the door. Doubt we will go back, especially after reading some of the other reviews here."}
{"text":"Good was terrific, good portions and the service was excellent. Multiple people came to check on us and kept the coffee full. We will be back."}
{"text":"So today we made our first visit to Stacks and Yolks.  A lot of action for a small space,  but it was Sunday and very busy. 

The food is good,  but the real asset to this place are its employees.  Awesome service with smiles and attentiveness.  

That being said... We ordered gluten free pancakes for an extra $2,  which we are used to.  The gluten issue is an allergy,  not a preference. The pancakes came out looking incredible.  Big,  fluffy and delicious.  

Here's the kicker... No gluten free options to put on the pancakes.  No syrup,  no butter,  no honey.  The regular syrup and honey has gluten in it.  So the pancakes had to be boxed and taken home. 

Initially I was going to give them a 3 star.  Who makes gluten free objects,  but fails to augment that dish with gluten free sides? 

Well,  the manager or owner rushed over to our table and tried every thing to find a gluten free option for the pancakes.  He listened attentively as we explained how the syrup he has in the restaurant has gluten in it.  He seemed very surprised and promised to get a gluten free syrup. He was very kind and apologetic. 

So all you prospective managers out there,  learn from this guy at Stacks and Yolks.  Simply because of good communication between him and a customer,  I bumped it up to a  4 star. 

We will return in a week or so to see if they added a gluten free syrup."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I stopped by after church on a Sunday and thoroughly enjoyed our experience!

It's a small, cute place to grab some good grub.  We arrived around 1130 am and the place was full but not packed.  We seated ourselves and were promptly waited on.

My husband got the fried chicken and vanilla waffle and thought it was MUCH better than Hash House.  He said the fried chicken was the best he'd had on the west coast (he's a southern gentleman).  He likes the chicken to shine through and not be overwhelmed by seasoning and he thought that The Griddle nailed their fried chicken.  I did take a bite of his waffle and it was literally the best waffle I've ever had.  Now, i'm not a waffle expert or anything...but it was light and deeeelish!

I ordered the french toast combo and again, I was super pleased with the taste.  The french toast was thick and had a hint of cinnamon.  I ordered my eggs over-medium and they were cooked to perfection!  The bacon was done nicely, crispy but not charred.

My daughter had the kids smiley face pancake and it was ENORMOUS.  We ended up taking 3/4 of it home. 

The orange juice was freshly squeezed and very tasty and the coffee was good for diner coffee.

All in all, we were extremely glad that this place caught our eye.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Don't even know how the food is because we never got to order. They sat three of us at a two top. Never dropped menus. Got a drink order in and got one ice tea. Waited 15 more minutes then dropped three bucks on the table and left. Hope the tea isn't much cheaper then three bucks. Bye."}
{"text":"I got the marinated steak tips and they were amazing. I was welcomed right away as I came in. The place is pretty small and I can't even imagine what it looks like when there busy. The food came out quick which is always a plus. Even with it being slow the staff wasn't very attentive and only checked on us once when we were done with our meal."}
{"text":"I absolutly love this place! I HIGHLY recommend The Griddle for breakfast and lunch isn't bad either! There selection of pancake and french toast is what really wins me over! I requested coconut on my french toast and what do they do...they bake it inside my french toast! THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD! 
I love that The Griddle gives off a home like feel and it's quiet most of the time. The staff also checks up on the table and always refills drinks before we have to ask.

I love this place and recommend it to everyone who loves a lil breakfast place with great variety!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. 4 servers standing around while the busser Angel served us because I asked if anyone was gonna take our order after sitting while with no greeting only Angel serving coffe, water and making sure we had our proper silverware setup the servers stood around and talked didbt even come by. I have no idea why Angel isn't a server he took the order and remembered without writing it down.  He was the hardest working person in the restaurant besides the chef. Very disappointed for my first impression.  Food was pretty good decor and ambiance all the makings of an intimate passionate breakfast spot that I won't return to often because of the  unpassionate servers who expect a tip for standing around.  So Dissatisfied made the food pale to what could be better tasting and a great experience. Not impressed get new servers who actually care about working for a tip because they earned it not because it's expected. Tips stands for= To Insure Proper Service.  The morning staff on 11/20/14 ."}
{"text":"They can cook the hell out of a Stack, but can't cook a yolk to save there life. Eggs cold, hash brown cold and barely cooked. French Toast was good but they have a bad kitchen process or a bad cook. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Please teach you servers and managers to not tell the customers (like it's a great excuse or something) that \"it's your Friday\" dreading like they work you to the ground, or that \"I just got thrown into this, my owner just told me to take care of it.\" 

The food wasn't that bad, but the service was unbearable. From the hostess, to the server, to the \"just got thrown into this\" Manager."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place. Little did I know... We tried it out last Saturday. We were sat at a booth in the corner. The floor was filthy dirty with food all over the place. Where was the bus boy to have cleaned this up?  I ordered a freshly squeeze orange juice and it tasted as if they mixed molded orange with it. I exchanged it for an Arnold Palmer which was not that great. I tried the special marinated steak with eggs. The meat was so salty and rubbery; the eggs nothing special, home fries were cold and tasted almost like a frozen product. I asked for them to put some more heat on them and make them well done. Also my sour dough toast was so lightly toasted that it was also disappointing.  My girlfriend's son had the waffle and he did not like it all. She mentioned it was gooey and not properly cooked. She also asked for her potatoes to be made crispier. We also tried the Red Velvet pancake and that as well had a strange texture. It was gummy like the batter was over mix. Maybe my expectations were too high? Or maybe we came to close to the closing time that the staff just wanted out!

The owner mentioned that they had no affiliation with the West Hollywood Griddles. Pity cause the California one was so much better!"}
{"text":"If I could exclusively eat at Stacks and Yolks for breakfast, I absolutely would. They always cook everything to perfection and it's delicious. I've been about 5 or 6 times and they have something on the menu for everyone, even my vegetarian girlfriend. Check out their specials for serious awesomeness. It's a breakfast place and gets busy on the weekends. Obviously the servers are going to be busy and it might take more than 5 minutes to prepare the most delicious breakfast skillet you've ever had the privilege of putting in your mouth. As for the folks who complain about the service, I have to imagine they are among the ranks of the most impatient people in the Southwest. The servers are all super cool and have always taken great care of us, with lot's of coffee refills and recommendations."}
{"text":"If you're starving and have 30 minutes in your hands, this is the place to go. Prices are reasonable, servers are friendly and swift and the food is superb."}
{"text":"The food was great put the service was a little slow. Had to wait about 15 minutes for someone to take our order then we had to wait for the server to come back so we could get refills"}
{"text":"This was the worst dining experience I've had in the past 10 years. The service was absolutely terrible. If you have kids, this is the last place to go. My food took around 45 minutes to come out because they \"misplaced the order ticket\" and by the time the food came the kids were so upset I had to leave with the kids and get the food boxed to go. Ended up paying $50 for soggy pancakes and horrible service. The waiter took an additional 30 minutes to run the credit card on top of all of their mistakes already. The worst part is upon calling to speak with the owner I was told they would refuse to refund the amount spent because we were sent home with food to go in boxes (which never ended up getting eaten) and refused to accept any responsibility nor apologize for the terrible service. DINE AT YOUR OWN RISK!"}
{"text":"Ahhh....The Griddle! Cute little restaurant in a strip mall with the greatest owner! 

Ok.....here's the play by play of my experience. I walk in the restaurant after a LONG night of drinking. Hungover and looked like a HOT mess! Lol. Anyhow....was greeted by the owner with a funny hand shake and was quickly sat. It was obvious that I was hungover and tired, so coffee was quickly brought by one of the waitresses. I browsed over the menu and was going to order the biscuits and gravy. But as I was waiting for my friends to decide the owner comes by and tells us that there are specials that are off the menu. 
He tells us about all the different pancakes that he's come up with....like cranberry orange, chocolate chip, red velvet....ect. There was also a marinated beef tip special that he had as well. He made everything sound SO delicious that we all closed our menus and decided to share. We ordered the red velvet pancakes, cran orange pancakes, side of bacon, sausage and the beef tips. 
Once we got our food we devoured everything! There wasn't one thing left! The pancakes were moist and full of flavor. The beef tips were perfectly marinated and juicy! 

SO GOOD!

I love little mom n pop shops! By the time we left we felt like a part of the Griddle family. 

I'll definitely be back every weekend.  :)"}
{"text":"If Burger King served it's breakfast as a sit-down establishment, it would be 100 times better. Enough said."}
{"text":"Food was fabulous!  Service was great..... All the bad reviews are crap! Try it you won't be sorry....."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular.  Salad had over ripe strawberry and red delicious apples.  They claimed they unexpectedly ran out of buckwheat pancake batter...there are better places to eat for the money."}
{"text":"We found this place right before moving away from Las Vegas =(. The red velvet pancakes are AWESOME. Unfortunately the rest of the food is so/so and the service is very slow on weekends, but the red velvet pancakes would keep me coming back despite those two major issues....that's how good it is."}
{"text":"I don't usually post reviews on Yelp however this is necessary. My boyfriend and I went here for the 1st time because we have heard great things about this place. We were not impressed! I ordered the lemon blueberry pancakes with cream cheese, boyfriend ordered philly skillet. Three cups of coffee later, finally got our food. My boyfriends food was ok, my pancakes however were completely uncooked after cutting into them. They offered to remake them, fine. After watching multiple tables get served food and 30 more mins of waiting, still no pancakes. You would think they would have made my breakfast a priority considering we have been there for a long time already. The server even handed us the bill before the pancakes were even served. We ended up asking them to take it off the bill because my boyfriend was already done and I was already frustrated. We were excited to try this place, however we will never return here again."}
{"text":"Took 20 min just to get our drinks in. After getting our drinks it took another 10 min to order our food and it took another 25 min after ordering to see if our food was ready (witch it wasnt) to see if we can just take it to go. They said another 5 minutes and we just decided not to wait. Seems like a good place just service is way behind and everything takes long."}
{"text":"The pancakes are delicious. I had the blueberry lemon poppy seed pancake with the whipped cream cheese topping, it was great. I would put the whipped cream cheese on everything. I also had the veggie burger. It was good but I think the breakfast here is awesome:)"}
{"text":"No complaints from me. Pretty large portions for the price and unbelievably better than the other chain breakfast restaurants."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed at all. Read the reviews and we were excited to try it out, but was very disappointed. Especially since we called our order in and they forgot to put part of our orders in the bag. Drove home to our hungry out of town guests, but had to drive back to get the rest of our orders. 

Luckily for us, we had leftovers in the  fridge and the kids ate that, because they didn't enjoy their food. Honestly the things we ordered, we can whip up at home and I wish we did. Sad to say my pops left on his last day of vacay here in VEGAS having had this terrible breakfast. 

The red velvet pancake was far from yummy and we also had the philly skillet, which also wasn't great either and the great gobbler tasted like any meal you could throw together yourself at home. If we weren't pressed for time, we would have just made breakfast in our own. When your toddler doesn't even want to eat the meals, what does that say to you? In total we ordered 6 different dishes and not one of them wowed us. Not too sure we even want to come back to try anything else, especially when 6 out of 6 dishes we ordered today didn't wow us."}
{"text":"We ordered churros French toast and corned beef hash. The French toast was so good. The combination of sugar, cinnamon, and syrup made my morning. The corned beef and hash was okay, nothing special to it. Will be back to try the pancakes. I was eyeing the Alabama pancakes."}
{"text":"Stood in the doorway for five minutes. No one greeted us.  Probably great food since they were busy.  But with waiters and waitresses buzzing all around, even going around us to get outside, it would have been nice to have been noticed."}
{"text":"Sunday morning at 8:30. Good food, nice decor and good service.  We were full from the large portions and leaving shortly after 9 am. I enjoyed the country breakfast."}
{"text":"I've never written a single review on any restaurant but I feel like this place deserves one. My husband and I just recently moved to Las Vegas and have been to many different breakfast specific places, because breakfast is our favorite so we are picky. We came to Stacks and Yolks and had their Arizona skillet and French toast, hands down best breakfast we've had and since then we go every weekend! We love this place!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast this morning. Gotta say the food was great and the staff were friendly and attentive. Well worth the wait ! Definitely coming back for another stack of the Lips and friendly service !!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible!!!!  Baja the owner has no clue on how to run this establishment 
the food isn't  good & the wait to be seated is ridcoulous!! 
 the hostess wasn't knowledgable & while we were there 4 people came in that knew the owner  Baja & they were seated right away & me and my husband had been waiting for 45minutes.  DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE ITS HORRIBLE!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my worst restaurant experiences. My family walked in and and we're greeted by a staff (has star tattoos on her neck) who you can tell was uncomfortable with seating brown people in ethnic garbs. We're seated after 10 minutes and wait another 10 for our drink order to be taken. From that point we receive no service. I watch as every other table gets multiple refills, and every time skipping our table. We notify the staff and she says we were just seated. We've been sitting for 40+ minutes. You can't see a table of colored people in a sea of white faces? We live in the neighborhood. Will not be returning, and will notify others to avoid. Totally disgusting. We wanted breakfast, not a plate of racism."}
{"text":"Ehhhhhhhhhh.   Sat outside and roasted in the sun.  If ur gonna go stick to pancakes."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today.  Service was piss poor and extremely slow, but the wait staff was very friendly - We were given another diner's check two different times by two different servers.  The protein pancakes tasted like rubber.  Will try again but this is not nearly as good as Egg Works and Egg and I..."}
{"text":"Stacks and Yolks has gotten it right. Not only is the food great they want their customers to feel welcome. Freddie was our waiter the last time we visited and he was funny, attentive (but not too much so) and shook my husband's hand as he left saying \"Thank You\". It may not seem like much but it was refreshing. We were seated quickly, my coffee was filled often before I knew it and the wait was negligible considering the amount of buisness happening that Friday morning. Ben, my husband, had the special which was a Carne Asada skillet and I had the lemon blueberry pancakes.  I tried Ben's meal and it was delicious. The pancakes were light and had the right amount of flavor, not overpowering.The portions were more than filling and we ended up taking some home. I would definitely recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"A weekly must! It's filling, they use fresh fruit, and it's consistently good. I get an Always November combo. It tastes like a pumpkin pie, and don't forget to spread the cream cheese topping (it's not a lump of butter that comes on top, be sure to try it!!!). The portions are large, so I usually ask for a single pancake because they're so filling. Every meal has been excellent. The original server crew is excellent and most of the new staff is friendly. Baja, the owner, will often say hi personally to guests and will sometimes surprise us with a new pancake flavor. Btw, s'mores pancake? Pure flavor! I'm drooling! But it's sweet so leave it as a dessert."}
{"text":"Owner is hilarious and staff is super friendly. Every meal I've ever gotten here is damn good. I recommend the Philly skillet and peanut butter pancakes with bananas!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? I originally heard about this place after seeing a Valentine's day special on the morning news. \"Come here for heart shaped pancakes!\". They must've really needed the business. 

My boyfriend and I came to the Cheyenne location on a Wednesday morning around 830am. It wasn't too busy. The first thing we noticed was how the building appeared to be an old remodeled drive through taco shop. The front door is very loose and it swung open and hit the wall as we tried to walk in. 

It was confusing walking in as there was no sign that said \"seat yourself\". After standing in a small line of people for a few mins the woman at the cash register advised us we could seat ourselves. 

We sat down at a little booth and the first thing I noticed was how uncomfortable the seats were. It seems as though they just kept whatever furniture was there from the previous owners. After sitting down I  noticed there was a couple utensils under the table that had not been picked up and my feet kept kicking them around.

Now onto the food. VERY DISSAPOINTING. The coffee was WEAK. Most of the food seemed overpriced. I got a Belgian waffle and 3 eggs scrambled with toast and home fries. The begian waffle was so dense I'd didn't finish it. The potatoes were greasy and under seasoned. 
My boyfriend who usually eats all of his food and more didn't even finish half of his skillet. 
We had high hopes for this place but will stick to other breakfasts places we've been too(egg works!)"}
{"text":"Immediately inviting decor and staff. Very artistic and cozy! Freddy was a rad server! The fact that they have vegetarian/vegan options a huge plus. The food is freakin delicious and I can't wait to bring everyone back!!! See you's soon. 1ove"}
{"text":"This place is a dump. You walk in to no waiting area and have to stand right next to people sitting trying to eat their crappy food. When you finally get seated don't ask for a highchair for your little one .... They are all broken & sticky. All of them don't properly work according the waitress we had. Now.... I wanted to wash my hands before I ate... This bathroom... Omg...the toilet was clogged. (Possibly by someone who was able to choke down the eggs?). It was a filthy bathroom. I've seen way cleaner bathrooms on road trips across country. Now for the food... I ordered Portuguese sausage and eggs, the other people in my party also ordered eggs... Scrambled. The eggs came out with a brown slime on them. When we questioned it the waitress said they were soft scrambled. Having not asked for \"soft scrambled\" we sent them back asking for regular scrambled eggs. While waiting for these eggs to be cooked properly, I dived into my potatoes. I went for the ketchup only to be disgusted by a sticky bottle. Not to drag this out any further the new eggs came back... Still with brown slime. The waitress tried to explain that they use fresh eggs and this happens. Please do not insult me... I know how to make scrambled f'ing eggs. Never seen brown slime. End of story.... When cashing out we told them how terrible it was and we wouldn't be back only to be stared at blankly and told sorry as she took my debit card and charged me for a cruddy meal I didn't eat. 
The positives... The potatoes were cooked. We had napkins. And the one plain pancake we got was fluffy. Not enough for me to recommend or ever go back to."}
{"text":"Pancakes are great! I didn't care for the meat lovers the orange juice was great! We sat outside it was so crowded inside.  But better than the food was the service. I really like attentive service and I was not disappointed. We stopped in on our way to the barbershop next door I am really glad we stopped."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here a few months ago. The wait was super long. Once seated I felt we were crammed in the building like sardines. How close to you have to be to the next table. Such a tight squeeze so ridiculous. Since the place was so busy we were hoping for an incredible meal. The food was okay good. Nothing spectacular about it. 

Ordered the pancakes which they are know for but it seems like a generic recipe. 

The floors were dirty didn't seemed to be cleaned between customers. We love other breakfast places way more then this place. Probably won't be back again. 

A little claustrophobic."}
{"text":"Got the corned beef hash kit. With a pancake. Food was not hot which was sorta disappointing. Flavors were decent. Fast and friendly service. Big portions."}
{"text":"First time here.outstanding. had the garden skillet sizzling fresh veggies,big portions cooked just right. Service hit all the marks, Antonio did a great job. The dining room could use booths,but I sat outside. Best breakfast I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"First time we went was 45 min wait. While they brought out my table's food they informed me they were out of gluten free batter. They offered me something else but I declined bc my family was already eating. They pressured me to order something else and against my protest my family waited for my new food to be delivered. Once the egg dish was delivered we all began to eat (family's food cold now). After two bites I realized my veggie egg dish had meat in it (20 yr vegetarian). I sent it back and watched my fam eat lukewarm food. 

We tried this place again bc I really wanted gluten free waffles. They were mushy and bland. We had 5 different servers and every single one of them offered to top off my coffee (which normally I like) but this was excessive. Literally every 30 secs I declined coffee. Went to bathroom at end of meal. No toilet paper, no paper towels. They should telling one of the coffee pushers to check out the potty. 

Will not return obviously."}
{"text":"This placed is cramped with people in such a tiny space. The hostess told us it would be 15-20 minutes wait but we finally got seated after 25 minutes. Service was horrible and the food was not as described in the menu. I ordered a short stack of meat lovers pancakes and got a single which turned out to be a blessing since it did not taste good. The menu portions were not as expected having tried Egg Works and Pappas. I would not recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"Ordered The Lumber Jack, The Great Gobbler and the Kids French Toast. The Lumber Jack came out perfect with everything it suppose to come with. Did not receive our sour dough toast with the Gobbler and also did not receive the bacon that came with the kids French toast. A bunch of kids run that place. No one came to check on us until they were ready to give us the bill. We paid the bill and left. We did not ask for what was missing.
Will not return, can get the same food somewhere else with better service."}
{"text":"It was our first time being there, both my bf and I have worked in the food / customer service industry. The \"hostess\" who in my honest opinion hated her job, was unwelcoming. Without even written our name on the waiting list, we were ready to turn around. Food isn't so pleasant either."}
{"text":"Stacks & Yolks!! Nom nom nom.. Always heard good things. Definitely lived up to expectations! Channeled my inner fat kid and had the chicken&waffles, Arizona skillet and the Elvis pancake. All bomb!! Would order again for sure. Loved the atmosphere, laid back and friendly. Everybody was really cool, their vibe is perfect! It's like a place you can cure a hangover AND bring family."}
{"text":"okay so my corworker and i went here for lunch. i was oober excited because i had heard from a friend that the food was good. anyhow, we ordered the red velvet pancakes with eggs and sausage aswell as the pesto pelt. now, off the bat the service was awful; the sever had no personality and was rude and not so helpful. ( i was already wanting to leave). 50 min later ( without anyone checking on us) our food finally comes out ( only half the order) no pesto melt. no syrup, no condiments with our order so i get up and go get it myself.
 five min later the pesto melt comes out. now i have to say the pancakes were beautiful, definitely tasty. as far as the pesto melt, blah super oily i didnt even want to eat it. with the experience with the service and the tired turtle speed i was left dissapointed and debating on even returning. food 3 1/2 because of the tasty red velvet pancakes and 1 on customer service and speed!!!! so i would highly consider or getting new staff or train them to be friendly and lay off the oil with the pesto."}
{"text":"Ate there a few weeks ago but wanted to give my review a little distance from my visit for a \"cooling off period\" to see if my feelings would change, nope, didn't help.  So totally bummed.  I read and heard very mixed reviews about this place but wanted to check it out myself because those that reviewed it really well had some very compelling arguments as to why they loved this place.  I'm a caterer so I understand that you just can't please some people and I don't give credibility to bad reviews until I check it out myself.   I was hoping that those that had bad reviews just had no taste or were just angry people that were hard to please.  Well I'm not an angry person and I'm reasonable in my expectations of others and boy did this place miss the mark on all accounts.  Food: POOR QUALITY-can you possibly find cheaper products?  I know your in business to make a buck but do you have to up your profit margin so high that you cheat your customers of decent quality?  Service: UMM......who is my waiter?  Several people running around but I can't figure out who does what?!  I think the big guy was my waiter, but I'm not sure.  I saw him once when he took my order and then he never graced me with his presence again during my visit-oh wait, he did take my money but really didn't care that I seemed a little miffed at being ignored.  Guess I'm not a VIP.  You could tell there were some people in there that made the \"cool kid cut\" and they seemed to get personal attention but not the little people (who by the way will still be there when the cool kids find another hang out).  Value: see  \"food\" category above.  I don't mind paying for good quality-I know how much good products cost but I refuse to pay those kind of prices for crap.  I HATE giving reviews like this so if I ever find myself in a spot like this, I do try to look for SOME positive, the pancakes were great but they are not enough to bring me back.  Pancakes are a dime a dozen in this town.  whah whah whah.... on to bigger and better home fries that aren't hard in the middle."}
{"text":"Never again. This was our second time trying this place. (We were optimistic because we live so close) Service surpassed horrible to laughable. We had 3 different people try to take our drink order, and then once we received our waters, we waited about 10 minutes for someone to take our food order. (The restaurant was only about half full) We waited another 25 minutes for our food and a server came to drop off the check. Once she noticed our puzzled look, she asked if we had eaten yet. (Which she should have noticed since our silverware were clean and had no dirty plates, napkins, etc) When I replied \"no, we haven't gotten our food\", she asked \"really??\", and walked away. We waited about another 10 minutes and we received our food. My husband had $9 pancakes and I had a $10 egg white omelet. Both were very bland. I asked the same server for a water refill and she said \"ok\" and never came back, so I proceeded to get my own. I have no idea how this establishment won a \"Best of Vegas\" award."}
{"text":"We had a really nice server, he moved us in as it was getting hot and took care of us. Food was good, big portions. A lot of cinnamon on the French toast, almost overwhelming but still good. Will be back"}
{"text":"I came in today specifically for the pancakes and as always they were good, but unfortunately the cleanliness of this place is not up to par..the walls need cleaned of food and debris, the salt and pepper shakers need cleaned off, the windows are absolutely disgusting as well as the air vents located next to the restrooms I cannot believe how gross they are...they are black and filled with dust,please clean up it has turned me off from coming back."}
{"text":"The Griddle has recently changed its name to Stacks and Yolks, but is under the same management and still serves good food. I'm not much of a breakfast person, but my boyfriend is and we've gone to Stacks and Yolks several times. They have a solid menu and serve good food. If you are in the mood for a classic American breakfast; pancakes, eggs and bacon, this is a good place to go. They don't have the best potatoes and I feel there are plenty of other breakfast places in the Vegas area that are worth going to as well, but come here for a solid breakfast, they won't steer you wrong."}
{"text":"When the owner isn't here, customer service  lacks significantly, especially the shorter hispanic hostess girl. The coffee is served weak and in mugs with crusty stuff on them. The reason they have 3 stars is because the food is awesome and when the owner is in, customer service is on point."}
{"text":"not what i was expecting.. i mean with all the good wall decor.. food is mediocre.. im a corned beef and hash guy when it comes to breakfast.. i must say the corned beef and hash on this place is straight out a can.. not good.. 11.99? i rather pay $7 for it with eggs and bread. Service is all right although theres times where my cup of coffee is empty and i guess nobody pays attention to it.. took them 32 minutes and 16 seconds to bring out my food, i mean it wasnt that busy.. but im going to try this place again and im bringing my wife and kids and see how they do on that time.."}
{"text":"Great food but make sure you don't sit near the door.  It is extremely windy and everything blows off your table when the door opens. I asked to move tables and was told they were too busy to accommodate my request. Excellent food but I won't be back for this reason"}
{"text":"If you're alright with waiting, this place has a pretty awesome breakfast/ brunch menu. The staff is a little stiff, but the food is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Large dry pancakes. Ordered food pretty fast. Took over 30 minutes to get the food. It was also cold. We won't be going back. There is a old school car show in the parking lot though."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here last Saturday and we are back today. First off the owner is very hands on and a great people person. 
The pancakes are fantastic. Way better than baby stacks. Here they actually taste like the flavor you ask for and not baking powder. 
It's a small restaurant but service is pretty fast except for weekends because it is packed. Make sure to try this place out. 

Stacks on stacks on stacks. 
Cakes on cakes on cakes."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast and the oj is freshly squeezed sooo good 5 stars! Scrambled eggs with feta cheese is my fave w a side salad and fruit. Their pancakes with whipped cream and strawberries is sooo good as well"}
{"text":"Our go to breakfast place for lazy weekend mornings.  Servings are massive, and always hit the spot"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning around 9am.  The service time was unsatisfactory.  Took 10mins before someone came by to bring water.  It was another 10 mins for a server to take my food order and then 30 mins to get the food.  Considering it was only a short stack with eggs and bacon, that was too long. 
   The food was average.  The eggs arrived cold, and considering the pancakes are one of their main dishes, I would have expected them to be less rubbery.
  While I would like to have something positive to say about this restaurant, I struggle to do so."}
{"text":"OMG let me tell ya....Philly Skillett is da bomb !!! Blew me away...awesome food awesome everything !! Be prepared and hungry..."}
{"text":"Went in with my family on a. Busy Saturday morning. And before I give the ad review , I was in the service industry for years, I get it when you're slammed at a breakfast joint on the qeekend. Anyway, I ordered an omelet that was incorrect. Sent it back. I should have just eaten the first one because the next omelet I received was all waterly. I took one bite and just stopped there. The server politely asked if everything was okay for the second time and I told her and showed her it was watery and that I would rather just not eat it. She didnt eveb suggest to remove it from the bill and at one point she just laughed and said sorry you had a bad experience I guess we made made a bad first impression. Due to this, I will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Heard about this restaurant on the local news while on vacation, we ate breakfast there on our way out of town to go home.
   The hostess who sat us was awesome,  the food was delicious,  our waitress however was rather rude, kept cutting my daughter off as she was trying to order and saying \"oh, I thought you wanted french toast\" (I wanted french toast not my daughter)  and we felt like we were being rushed through our breakfast, about 5 minutes after we received our food we also received our check (also rude). 
  Would recommend the food any day but defiantly need to work on the staff."}
{"text":"We found this place while driving around looking for someplace to have lunch. When we came in we liked the decor and menu options. We first ordered drinks, two waters and one coffee. I think our waitress forgot about the coffee because she told us twice she was coming back with the coffee before she actually brought it. For our meals, I ordered the cranberry orange pancake and made it a combo and added an extra egg. My fiancé ordered the Country Combo and added a vanilla pancake. Our food tasted good but I found a hair in my eggs and my fiancé found a hair in his pancake. Neither of us told the staff, we were almost done eating so didn't want to make a big deal out of it. Also, the vanilla pancake didn't taste like vanilla, just a regular pancake. We told our waitress about the pancake not tasting like vanilla so she took off the extra dollar charge. However, when we got our bill my fiancé was charged $13.99 for his $6.99 meal and I was charged $2.99 for my extra egg that was supposed to cost $.99. Our waitress seemed a bit annoyed at us for mentioning anything but took the bill then another waiter brought it back fixed. They apologized but didn't seem too concerned about it. It's a shame the service is not good because we did like our food, except for the hairs. We won't be coming back after this experience."}
{"text":"Servers doing the bare minimum. 
We were in the neighborhood & decided to try this place. We we promptly seated, but waited more than 10 mins to be acknowledged by a server or bus person. In fact, the two parties that came in after us had their drinks and orders in before anyone came to our table. 
Food was ok. Nothing out of the ordinary. Had to repeatedly ask for water refills. Service counters were dusty and glass partition between dining area and kitchen hasn't been cleaned in a minute. Seating is crowded, not much room for people to walk to/from their table without being on top of other diners."}
{"text":"I have tried to give this place chance after chance and have been let down all three times. The restaurant DIRTY, the bathrooms DISGUSTING. My friend received a cup of coffee with lipstick still on it. Do you even wash them? Or check before you bring them to tables! The food is below average, no flavor definitely not worth your buck. Never got a refill, the waiters never checked on us. I came here a few months ago and over heard someone from the waitstaff (younger teenager) ask the owner something, the man told him to \"deal with it,\" grabbed his take out and left. He's also the a**hole with the white Mercedes who parks in the HANDICAP spot in the very front. Cmon dude are you kidding. How disrespectful. Did some research on the place, they were once on dirty dining. I will never return."}
{"text":"This place SUCKS! I'm more than willing to pay high prices for a good meal, but man this place robs you. Plus the food is very bland, and for what you pay you leave hungry. Also the service sucks with a smile."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Too bad the cashier doesn't wash his hands after every cash transaction. Notice he would use a dirty towel to clean his hands and dry them with his pants. He also puts the bread in the toaster and butters them, and gives out the food To the servers. To my knowledge that's a health code violation."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?? The reviews below must not have gone to the same \"the griddle\" as I was at. This is by far, the best breakfast experience I have ever had at any restaurant. The food was incredible, french toast was perfect. The freshly squeezed orange juice was fantastic. Went there two days in a row, and both times were exactly the same experience, wonderful. My Fiance and I are definitely making this our weekend routine. The service was just as awesome as the food. The owner even brought out these little french toast fried bites for free. So freaking good! He was super nice and really made the whole experience great. Made you feel like your part of his family and you are over at his house for breakfast. Truly amazing service. 

P.S. whats with the three dollar signs?? This place is not expensive at all?"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the pumpkin pecan pancakes, home potatoes, turkey patties are the Bomb. Great friendly service and prices are reasonable.."}
{"text":"Yet another breakfast joint to add to my long list of favorites! Just like their sister store in the east, The Griddle in the southwest does a great job of serving up the first meal of the day. 

First off the service is great. Friendly people with a sense of humor. The place is tiny but great decor and there is also outdoor seating. I usually stick to the basic egg, canadian bacon duo but I did a combo on my last visit due to a severe pancake craving. All good! The choices of pancake flavors are plentiful! The coffee is also pretty great quality for a place that churns it out nonstop, not watery or lukewarm. The people next to us got a skillet and MAN it smelled amazing. Lunch lovers they take care of you as well with assorted wraps and sandwiches. 

The pricing is just fine and just off the highway, can't beat the location. They do a steady business but I've never had to wait at this location. Watch for the sign though, you could miss it from the road!"}
{"text":"This place has great customer service and has a wide selection of food for all appetites. The pancakes are huge. And they also offer \"Fresh Watermelon Juice\" it's sweet but DELICIOUS. Will definitely be back a lot"}
{"text":"This place was so good! Gavin was our sever and he was so friendly. My wife had the hot chocolate and it was one of the best. My red velvet pancakes were something I would definitely order again. My wife and I will be back."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to this location and I'm still not impressed. The hostess was overwhelmed, put us on the list and said we only had to wait 7 minutes(group of 3) Another group of 4 came and waited 2 minutes before getting seated. Our name was crossed off the list and the hostess didn't realize until after she'd seated the other group that we were still waiting. She did not apologize immediately. She kept going back and forth inside. Finally she apologizes, takes us inside and makes us wait for a table to be cleaned that was still being occupied by other diners. When I asked her why she crossed off our name as \"seated she could only say \" it's been hectic.\" My opinion, get a new hostess. If she can't handle a brunch rush, then she needs to be moved and someone else who handles stress better placed outside. Once again. This is my second time at this location. The food is good tho."}
{"text":"Just don't bother. 

The restaurant seems harmless, but it is not worth having to endure mediocre food and absentee service. I noticed some of the other comments about lack of cleanliness and it is still noticeable today. The chairs and booster seats for kids looked filthy. Silverware is dull and dingy. Sometimes it's OK to spring for a new bottle of ketchup when the original labeling is nearly worn off and the cap is battered. It makes one wonder what other corners are being cut...

The food is OK, just unremarkable and unmemorable."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast restaurants has officially gone from 5 stars to 2 stars. Never coming back again!

First, they are way understaffed. The restaurant is always busy, but they don't have the staff to accomodate. The food is slow to come out, the waiters are running around telling guests that they are busy, and the check takes forever even if you go up to the registered.

Second, the quality of the food has gone down tremendously. Their recipe was perfection but the cooks have ruin them. My food was cold, my eggs were not cooked how I want them, and their food doesn't taste great anymore.

Third, this is more of a personal issue, but I found a large piece of glove.....in my food! IT WAS GROSS! When I brought it up to the staff, they were annoyed at me. I'M SORRY YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMER'S HEALTH. In addition, they charged me for the food and did not bring me a new plate of food. So I had to ask the waiter to take my meal off the bill. They were giving me nothing, but attitude. I will take my money somewhere else then."}
{"text":"The pancakes, eggs and bacon were delicious.  A great assortment of pancakes and they are HUGE so you really only need the single stack.     But service is SLOW!  Prepare for a 2 hour experience to have breakfast here.   The ambience was great and we were with family so we had fun."}
{"text":"How anyone can compare this place to Dennys is insane. After reading some old reviews I definitely think the owner made some changes for the better.

 First time here on Sunday for brunch was great! The place was busy but we were seated in a timely manner. 
We ordered a skillet, lemon blueberry pancakes, pumpkin spice pancakes all of which were great! The menu has a lot of variety.
I did not see one worker on their cell phones and I Love That, (phones have so many germs and you look lazy)
I think the prices are fair and I would definitely recommend that people give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Service was good, clean restaurant. The food is sad, canned corned beef hash,canned gravy over stail rock hard biscuits. Home potatoes cooked good but no flavor. Hubby had meat skillet, & we both could taste & see it was Jimmy Dean sausage chopped up in it. Nothing fresh & original here. One can make a better breakfast at home. $30 for canned & reheated frozen food. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"At first me and my girlfriend were hesitant to try this place since some reviews talk about how their service isn't the best.

I don't know what they are talking about to be honest.  

We had a great experience. 

Brandon was our server and he was not only fast and efficient (like the rest of the staff that approached our table at some point) but also friendly and had a great attitude. 

Give this place a chance like we did. The food is incredible, it has a great ambiance and atmosphere. 

And frankly, the service is great. 

We will be returning costumers for sure."}
{"text":"Stacks and Yolks was our favorites breakfast place we used to go there every weekend until it got so busy that you cant even get it anymore we recently tried to go there for breakfast and after waiting for half hour we decided to go somewhere else, you guys need to expend!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping to love this place because it is right across the street from me. Unfortunately it's just ok. My hopes were high as we arrived because the place was busy with families and hipsters alike. The staff is very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive and the decor is perfect for a casual breakfast and lunch spot. 

But it's all about the food, right? My wife had the French toast with a side of two eggs, over easy, and bacon. It was very tasty and she enjoyed it. My son (4) had the kid's pancake and bacon. The flavor was good but it was over cooked on one side and you couldn't cut through it with a fork alone. These pancakes require a fork and knife. I had a hankering for biscuits and gravy and they were extra disappointing. Neither were homemade. Rather than light flaky biscuits these are heavy and doughy. The gravy is straight out of a package and isn't doctored up with any sausage or additional flavor at all. Even my wife who will eat any version of biscuits and gravy found this offering blah.
 
The lunch offerings looked pretty tasty and I wished I had chosen the patty melt. I'll give it another go for lunch but won't return for breakfast."}
{"text":"I LOATHE the slumburbs, but get out of my downtown Las Vegas bubble to keep friends. I met a buddy here for breakfast a couple of weeks ago and was really surprised. Very nice interior, not corny looking 80's style country ducks and crap of my childhood. The food and service were dang great. Wish they had a place closer or I would have given it 5 stars. I rarely drive so far, but I might again for this place!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Amazing food and the guys there could not be more nice.  Sometimes service is pretty slow but generally understandable when you go in on a Saturday or Sunday morning and the place is packed.  I've taken a handful of people there and they all have said the place is great and have all become Griddle breakfast fans."}
{"text":"Huzzah for them staying open later, but I wasn't as impressed with the food as I thought I was going to be. I honestly will probably give them another try, because this trip was pretty average as average gets, and I have a gut feeling they can do better."}
{"text":"I'm impressed I heard stacks and yolks was a good place to eat. Those that told me this weren't kidding I had poached eggs on sourdough toast. A lot of places can ruin poached eggs but this place made them perfection. The service was excellent several people waited on me and made sure I was taken care of. Next I'll have to try their pancakes with are as big as a platter! Thanks stacks and yolks for a great breakfast I'll be back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, I get different vibes each time. Sometimes food is good, sometimes service is good. I ordered some breakfast, a Hobo skillet and a Lumberjack meal, plus a large OJ. I paid about $25! I think that's very pricy for breakfast food. I feel the portions definitely don't match the price. It's just close to where I live, so I'll go once in a while."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while.  Now I can cross it off my list forever. Had the pumpkin pancake combo and the pancake tasted sour. Not appetizing at all. Place was busy so I guess that's why the coffee refills were slow in coming. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Great customer service, but there was just nothing about the food I had that was worth returning for. I had one of the skillets and red velvet pancakes that were so highly raved about. Both were okay, but Neither were great. Potatoes definitely mediocre. I'm a huge breakfast person and go to places all over town and I really wanted to like this place but it just didn't do it for me. Maybe I'll go back and try it again just because the staff was so friendly, but unsure."}
{"text":"This was my first visit.  The food and service were fantastic! I was greeted immediately and coffee was poured promptly.  I had heard about the pancakes so I knew I only needed one, and it was the best I have ever had. I also had 2 eggs and 2 slices of bacon both cooked to perfection.  I will definitely be going back! I will avoid the weekends, 'cause this place has to be packed on those days. This has to be the best breakfast place in the north. I used to think it was the Cracked Egg, but now it's Stack & Yolks - Jones!"}
{"text":"Went in with three other family members was told 10 to 15 min wait place was packed . Waited 15 minutes for a party of 6 to  come in and be seated before us. To be told they called in a reservation . What no signage nothing . Then the lady behind counter wondered why we would do a review on yelp . Lost my business and anyone else who will listen"}
{"text":"great  food lol , fantastic... if you're tired of going to the same ol breakfast restaurants IHOP and Denny's in all the other regulars when you want something different like a down-home breakfast made from people that really take pride in their food and their quality this is a place to go everything is always excellent been there numerous times this is one of my favorite places that I always go before anything else customer service quality and 100% satisfaction"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast spot I have found since I moved to Vegas. Their pancakes are soooo good. One thing I don't like is the smell. I have been there a few times and it always smells damp, like mop or towels or something. Overall the food is good. Would be good if the coffee was better"}
{"text":"Ate here today for the first time. Great service and food was awesome!  They catered to our dietary needs no problem! We can be picking (weight cutting sports) and they had no issues cooking without oil or butter. We will be back often!"}
{"text":"No matter the time of day or the day of week this place is always hopping with people!  Expect a small wait but you will be rewarded with good service and excellent food."}
{"text":"WORST PLACE EVER!! everybody's sucks !! Just went there for the first and last  time ever. Bad customer service. Dirty dinning. No manager present so if u complaint either u suck it up or walk out. I'll be sending out health department.  What a nasty place ,I can't believe I stayed so long in that place. It deserves zero stars"}
{"text":"I have brought my wife and my daughter here. I love the staff and Baha is a great guy always working and great portions . I highly recommend this place for large portions and great food.."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Delicious chicken fried steak. Incredible (and huge) pancakes."}
{"text":"Great food , stuff very friendly, great selection on menu but only thing that it turned me off  it was the floor the tiles and grout wete very dirty I asked the server it seems like it's a big deal I hope they get it cleaned someday also silverware needs to be polishing before going to table atention ti details it's important does the  health department sees that too ?"}
{"text":"Great food, ok proces, too busy most of the time but they end up making it work.  My whole family was happy and we'd definitely go back.  Get e bacon, it's cooked to perfection, and the orange juice is for real fresh squeezed stuff which no one EVER does anymore.  Good eats."}
{"text":"My two sisters, 5 year old son and I come into this location today. My son ordered chicken fingers and as I'm cutting it I find the chicken is raw. We sent it back (without any kind of apology) and it took about 25 minutes to get another batch of 2 chicken fingers. No managers came by, they still kept it on the check... very disappointed. We enjoy the food there but raw chicken for a kid?? A little ridiculous."}
{"text":"This is our go to breakfast place. The fresh squeezed oj is so good. Beware--the pancakes are HUGE (think the size of a big dinner plate). Even the kids pancakes are massive."}
{"text":"Hidden gem... I've never been to either of their two locations, and I wasn't sure about this place at first, as it had a drive in thru and I didn't want \"fast food\" then I walked in & was pleasantly surprised, it was a nice, clean restaurant and people were very friendly & attentive. It was close to their closing time & they didn't try to rush us outta there. They close st 3 pm on Sat

Our waiter Gaven was so friendly (they all were actually) and helpful with his honest opinion on food was refreshing. He help me nail down a great omelette! He really did perform well, which we reflected in our tip. 

The breakfast menu was extensive & the several different pancake batters were impressive & interesting, I wasn't in the mood for 
Pancakes, but I am for sure coming back to try some red velvet pancakes or maybe peanut butter batters. I Can't recall them all but if you're pancake person I'd highly recommend Stacks & Yolks (Jones/Cheyenne) they had skillets, stacks, the burritos sounded great too, but I got the made to order omelette w/homes fries. Took half of it home with me as the food portions are good size,tad above normal, but not too large that it was too much. 
My friend got a skillet I should had taken a picture as it looked amazing! She enjoyed it as well... She ended up taking half hers home as well. 
So over all I really like this place as it's a hidden gem & we'll for sure be returning
There are too many delicious meals I'd like to try. Try this place You won't be disappointing. 
Thanks Gaven you made the difference'"}
{"text":"Food was decent but beware, they charge $2 for a cup of hot water. When questioned, they said that they charge for the cup. ... really???? So we should be able to take the cup home then???? It's just hot water!!!!!  Service was slooow (went on a Tuesday morning). We had to wait so long for our check. The table next to us was totally ignored. Had I not told the waiter to take their check too, they would have been waiting much longer. It was busy but still had open tables and no one waiting for a table."}
{"text":"You get seated quickly, then you order, then you wait for 40 minutes to get your food. 

Can't say how the food tasted, we left 40 minutes into waiting for our food

Their kitchen is terribly understaffed"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the staff is attentive and courteous. My boyfriend and I came here during a busy breakfast hour and we were immediately greeted and handed menus, the food is great. But I would mainly come back for the impeccable customer service, the owner even came by to make sure we were being taken care of!! I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food is ok. Had a really good dish just once & the other few times it wasn't anything special. The food takes a pretty long time to get to the table and there are always flys in the restaurant. The staff is nice."}
{"text":"Awesome service and great food. Highly recommend the speciality pancakes! Red velvet ones are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Beware 
If I could give a no star I would 
My order was incorrect 
Pancakes totally not what I asked for wait said so they are remaking them 
My family ate and I still had no food 
Finally got my pancakes 
Oh now they gave me raw pancakes 
Eggs were cold 
Waitress said she will get me new ones 
She returns in a minute 
I said that was quick it looked looks like the same eggs 
They were supposed to be over medium 
They look over hard 
She said they are the same eggs they sent them back for me to bring out 
That's really nice I said 
Is this establishment safe to eat at????
Never again will we return 
What a wast of time and money
We waiting long for the wrong food and long to be seated 
Looks like this establishment needs some cleaning and has gone down hill 
Windows nasty dirty 
When seated even had to ask for the leftover food to be cleaned off before we could sit down 

You think a manager would of came to rectify the situation 
Heck no 
So guess they don't care about satisfaction of their customers"}
{"text":"My second time was even better than the first. This time I got the chicken and waffles. OMG!!!! It was glorious. Love, love this place."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!! I love the protein pancakes, and the biscuits and gravy...Which I stole from my boyfriend's plate. The service is fast, food is quick even when they're busy and the staff is incredibly pleasant!! I love this place and I'm super stoked that I live down the street so I can come back often. And it's so inexpensive, I can afford it"}
{"text":"So apparently the trick is to come when it's not busy - the service is better. When they get busy, everything goes to hell. 
Food this time was again so-so."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service & they messed my order up.  I ordered eggs over medium & they were hard, I ordered the thick cut maple bacon & it was hard, & I ordered a side of tomatoes & never got them. I didn't get silverware until my food was cold & the server never came back till my plate was 3/4 empty for me to remind her about the tomatoes while the whole time I'm eating I'm listening to the awkward conversation of the Hostess talking to off duty employees eating hearing about the guy & girl the manager \"fucking\" fired. I heard the F bomb so much I wanted to go elsewhere. Then the waitress came over & was eating off his plate but nobody could do anything to up their service!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. Pretty good crowd. Limited menu, it appears it is just for breakfast and lunch. 
Enough choices. I had the special which was London broil tips with eggs, home fries and biscuit with gravy. My BF had biscuits and gravy. 
the special was very good, the London broil was very tender, the eggs cooked perfect, the biscuit fresh out of the oven, the home fries tasty and crispy which is how I like them . My BF's biscuits and gravy was a huge platter. 
The waitress was super friendly and provided very good service. 
The place was clean and had a nice aroma of breakfast upon entering. 
Will go back again."}
{"text":"Terrible service! My fiancé and I took our four kids here to enjoy breakfast together. We arrived and were told the wait would be 30 minutes, which we didn't mind because the menu looked awesome and the place had great reviews. Twenty minutes after being on the waiting list Vanderlei Silva shows up and insists on seating his party before ours. To top it off, the host crams our party of six at a table for four. I'm outraged! You won't be in business long if that is how you treat customers. We definitely won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"A HOMELESS SHELTER IS CLEANER THAN THIS PLACE!!

Wanted to try this place for a while now and I'm actually regretting my decision. I took my husband there for breakfast last week and when we arrived, we were told to sit anywhere. I guess that meant the ONE table that wasn't dirty.

This was just the first sign of many things wrong with this place. 
- The chairs are absolutely filthy!
- The floor looks like is hasn't been mopped in weeks!
- The encrusted, nasty ketchup bottles are a total health hazard.
- There NEVER seems to be sugar for your coffee.
- There's visible dust and dirt on the stainless counter under the kitchen window
- Kitchen storage looks unsanitary!

The food was lackluster. You're better off going to Denny's or an IHOP because its clearly a step up from this place. Service is extremely slow and they honestly don't seem to care. The OWNER, Bahador, (or Baja as the employees call him) was outside on his phone having a cigarette and is clearly in denial his place is falling apart. 

This \"restaurant\" closes each day at 3PM so there is NO EXCUSE was to why this place is so DISGUSTING! I'd be surprised if this place is still open by Summer's end. 

I will be contacting the Southern Nevada Health District and making a formal complaint about the unsanitary conditions of Stacks & Yolks!"}
{"text":"DEAR LORD AND THANK HEAVENS WE FOUND THIS PLACE... stumbled upon this place on a whim while starving and searching the internet and have never been so satisfied by a breakfast... the menu is huge and has so many creative, innovative options... I got birthday cake pancakes and my friend got deep fried French toast and we are currently trying to replan our road trip so that somehow we can stop back by this breakfast haven again!!!"}
{"text":"So I love coming here been a couple of times . Sometimes there is small wait but never more than 3-5min . I ordered the single stack meat lovers with only bacon with strawberries . But I make it a combo with eggs n sausage .So good keeps me coming back every time . They also make their own ok so good . They have a good variety of breakfast food from a big variety of pancakes with great toppings to skillets freshly made. I love it here n will be back"}
{"text":"Breakfast is so good here. There is usually a wait but it's worth it. I've noticed there isn't much to choose from for lunch. But this is a great place to go for breakfast. The owner is nice and is at the restaurant frequently. The staff is always very nice."}
{"text":"Best pumpkin cakes I've ever had in my life !!!! Kylie was the sweetest waitress and the whole staff was busy yet efficient.. Great way to start my Saturday !!! Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.  Hubby and I stopped in and had an amazing breakfast.  There is no way we could finish it all.  We will be back...and we will bring reinforcements!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is awful.  Very unorganized. If you are in a rush its not the place to to go, not enough staff for the amount of customers"}
{"text":"In Vegas for the weekend...Neighborhood Awards.  Stopped by ...on references ..the coffee is weak...water cardboard taste. However, the stacks and chicken is good. Price a bit high for breakfast and Vegas suburbs. Will come back service great!"}
{"text":"Overpriced , pacakes were like rubber...crabcake benedict hard as rock. Service slower than molasses..and yet staff young ...hmm so sadd."}
{"text":"Have been to stacks and yolks twice. 

 Have never had to wait for a table (both times have been pretty early to mid morning) 

Tried the lips pancakes both times (red velvet with strawberries and cream cheese frosting) very good. The other selection of food is pretty wide as well. Friends tried waffles and enjoyed it.

Downfalls to this place: service is pretty slow and unorganized. Tables are pretty close together. Both times I have found the place to be a little dirty (Silverwear/ plates/ cups)"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend for breakfast as I've heard good things. Well, not really impressed. Portions are good but not much flavor. Server never once came back to check on us. Water went empty and had to drink my girlfriends. Girlfriends food was under cooked on potatoes and poached egg over cooked. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place out much sooner since it is right down the street from my house. 

We were seated right away and our drink order was taken.  When our server came over she said, \"you guys ready to order?\"  No \"hi,\" \"how are you?\" or anything of the sort.  A little strange.

I ordered the french toast and added bacon, eggs, and toast.  Obviously I ate with my eyes.  It was okay.  There was way too much cinnamon on the french toast, even on the butter.  The eggs and bacon were just okay.  And my toast was forgotten about.  When our server brought over our food she said \"i'll be right back with your toast.\"  After a couple minutes of waiting I started looking around and saw it just sitting in the toaster.  The manager came over and asked what I needed, I told him my toast was just sitting there.  Obviously it was cold and hard when I got it.  My boyfriend liked his chicken and waffles.  I had a bite of his waffle and wished I'd ordered that instead.

Our server didn't check up on us,  just started clearing our plates.  

I wanted to like this place.  It gave off a cute family-owned feel.  Not sure if it is family owned, but it was a bunch of very young girls working and \"family\" signs on the walls.  Their checks are old-school, they write it all out, which was pretty neat. 

The lack of greeting/communication, forgotten toast, no check-up, and mediocre food earns this place two stars.  Maybe it was an off day, maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  Not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"Excellent peanut butter pancakes! Very filling but of course added the scramble eggs and sausage which hit the spot. Highly recommend trying."}
{"text":"Went here to enjoy their tasty churro items . We're seated upon entering well as drinks. Enjoyed a lemonade until noticing that the cup had stuff stuck to it from another meal. Picked up fork to notice 1 being dirty. then ordered chicken and churro a waffle , Only for it to come out with hair on it. So then 10minutes later they come over and try to replace my chicken n waffle with just french toast ... now I have to wait another 10 minutes . I mean the food is excellent but I wish we'd pay better to detail.  Like u should be able to notice a dirty glass."}
{"text":"The food itself was ok, but the waitress was rude and barely came to check on us. She didn't give us any refills and gave us our check while we were still eating and told us she would meet us in the front without telling us there is no rush or anything like that. I doubt I'll come here again."}
{"text":"Pancakes WERE dry that last review wasn't crazy. maybe its just a certain cook i dunno. but when we went, there was only 1 other table being served our meal still took around 30  minutes to get our food. he messed up our order but was quick and pleasant to fix the error. pancakes are HUGE. so if you like pleasant atmosphere, dry pancakes, and don't have anywhere to be soon, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast/brunch on Saturday after attending an Autism walk in Town Square. Located just south of 215/Durango, it is in the same plaza as Firehouse Subs, Volcano Grille, etc. Parking was a mild pain but we all got lucky and got enough spots for all our cars upon arrival. Lol 

Apparently, they are \"CASH ONLY\" According to my friends who's been here before, its been cash only for quite a while, and have yet to fix their system. My theory is, they trying to drag it as long as possible and take cash like some asian places LOL .... 

Also according to friends, the menu has been updated and changed a bit. Prices compared to menu's posted on yelp from late last year seemed to have up'ed a dollar, on average. 

To be honest, i'm not much of a breakfast person, but to have once in a while, im not against. And when there's a good one (like another place i had recently with a friend), i dont mind having again. mmm Lol unfortunately not this place Lol... 

After long consideration, decided to go for a simple breakfast. 

Corned Beef Hash w/ over easy eggs, hash browns, and a biscuit. Flat top grilled/cooked corned beef hash created a nice amount of crispy bits. Eggs were mildly under 'over easy' as some of the white hasn't set yet. Hash browns, were hash browns. XD Biscuit was good but quite small. Amount of food in my order seemed less than what you would get from a skillet, but then again, i may have been overly hungry. XD 

My friend had ordered canadian bacon, as she was craving it for some odd reason. It was quite thickly cut. Because it was so thick, it reminded us of ham. XD 

Two other friends had ordered philly skillet and carne asada skillet. Both piled quite high and looked pretty decent actually. Lol 

Luckily i didn't get the toast. It looked kind of sad and hard. awkwardly sized too. Didn't seem like a normal sized slice of bread 

I didn't see the mentioned poor service or dirtiness some other people have mentioned. We were served fairly well in a consistent fashion. Seated promptly. Yeah they didn't refill my water without asking but eh. We had a mess up with our \"bread\" orders and my friend had ate my biscuit thinking it was his english muffin. We recalled the waitress calling it an english biscuit when she brought the food. My mind/ears turned off when she said 'english' and i ignored it. Later realized it was my biscuit when his english muffin came later. She brought another biscuit, even after my friend said to put the new biscuit on his bill, but we weren't charged for it. When the waitress first brought our food, she asked us what hot sauce we wanted. I asked for Tobasco. Later my friend has for Cholula. Some how a 2nd bottle of Tobasco showed up too. Haha ! 

Maybe ordered the wrong things but this is like a normal breakfast place. Nothing that stands out, but nothing bad. A-ok XD"}
{"text":"This is a small, local restaurant that has a pretty creative menu that will have more than a few things for anyone to like.

This place is nearly always very, very busy. You will wait since this isn't a big chain restaurant that can afford bigger space. For anyone that doesn't have the time, go to a chain to avoid writing a bad review.

The servers are busy but friendly. They will take the time to assist by explaining some of the more unique items on the menu. I have eaten several things and can say they were all good.

Check it out but be prepared to wait. If you give it a try i am sure you will be back"}
{"text":"I'm happy to have finally found a breakfast spot by my house that doesn't have an hour wait on the weekends. When we first walked up we were actually concerned that there was only a 10 minute wait when every other breakfast spot around us is an hour or more. Stacks and Yolks did not disappoint though, breakfast was on point! Hubby and I each got a different skillet, I got the Arizona. They actually bring the breakfast skillet to you the way it should be, still sizzling and popping on the actual skillet. We got a stack of buttermilk pancakes to share that were fluffy and delicious, oh and HUGE. FYI one pancake is the size of a large plate, so if you just want a few bites you can probably go with a single pancake. Service is also on point, really friendly and fast wait staff. Prices are normal for a breakfast spot, total was $46 for a family of 4 so not bad at all. We will definitely be back here for our weekend breakfasts."}
{"text":"What a great place!!! We were looking for a place to eat after 7:00pm on a Sunday night and just happened to find this place. They are opened late and the food is fabulous. We had two of the specials as well as the orange cranberry short stack (which was huge). Everything was fresh and arrived quickly. The drinks were constantly replenished.

The staff made us feel like part of the family. The waiter was so engaging, making the dining experience so much better.Thanks Drew!!!!

We will definitely be going back to try the sandwiches, salads and other great breakfast items."}
{"text":"According to the staff they were short handed, which translate to, we can be jerks because we are overwhelmed. I would rather get McDonalds take out than deal with these people again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised. This place is super cute inside. The staff was really friendly, service was quick and efficient and the food was delicious! They are only open from 7-3 daily and my bet is that they are packed on weekends. If your looking for a new breakfast spot be sure to stop by."}
{"text":"First time here and unfortunately I'm not that impressed. Which is really sad because I had high expectations with this placed based on the reviews. I ordered the Lips stack with eggs and sausage and it took forever to get our food, probably around 25-30min. And when it came the food was sub-par. The red velvet stack (\"the Lips\") was like eating a rubber disc. When I went to cut it it pulled back and was \"tough\" to eat, literally. The eggs and sausage were fine so maybe this place is better suited for its skillets and omelette's. Also, the bus boy came by and asked how the food was and I mentioned the pancakes weren't that good and he said, \"they're like rubber huh?\" WTF?? The food isn't free for me to sit and listen to you talk it down. Also, they were quick to pick up their tip for the worst red velvets this side of Clark County, lol. When you hold a pancake on a fork in the air it should fall off to the plate, not this pancake. This thing stuck on the fork like a cheap TUFF steak."}
{"text":"Poor service. Food quality is just ok. Ran out of food items and it is only Saturday morning!"}
{"text":"This was the first time my Husband and I have been to a Stacks and Yolk. Wow. That's all I can say. Food was beyond amazing and the staff are outstanding. Our server was Keira and she was amazing! I only wish we lived closer to this location! If your eyes are bigger than your belly, I highly recommend this place! I would write more but I'm currently slipping into a food coma."}
{"text":"This place has great service with great food! One of the best breakfast places that I have been to in Vegas for a while. One of the pancakes was a little bit burnt but they offered us a new one and took the old one off our receipt. Manager and servers were all super friendly and very good and serving us. Thanks for a great experience! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious!! But we waited 30-40 mins for the food and it wasn't so busy and never did our waitress come by to see if we e needed something else or to even to apologize for the wait ."}
{"text":"Have eat here many times. Food is always good and plentiful. Service is always good. Sometimes you will have to wait to get a table as this place pulls a crowd nearly every day. They are only open till 3pm. Highly recommend this place for breakfast.."}
{"text":"Decent service - bland food.  It's like this place lost its mojo.

No fault to you, Freddie.. your service was great.

Eggs Benedict was okay, nothing to write home about.   The Hollandaise sauce needs a little something... like, flavor or whatever.  My boyfriend had the Meat Lovers Scramble and basically licked the plate clean.   It's breakfast, so I'm not going to sit here and nitpick the place to death.. it is what it is.

Convenience would be the only reason I ever go back to this place."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times with the wife and we like it here. Good food, nice small intimate area with the mom and pop feel. Good portions. Good prices. Kept the coffee coming (only complaint is a joke...no flavored creamer lol) will be back for breakfast again. And again."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast place. Service was great and the food was amazingly scrumptious. 

I had the Kit's Homemade Corn Beef Hash for the third time in a row. This is homemade hash made with red peppers and onions. It came with (3) eggs, potatoes, and a biscuit with gravy for $15.00. The biscuit was moist and the gravy was exceptional. I loved the hash - one of the best I've ever tried. The eggs were made exactly as ordered. 

The coffee was also good, but I wish they served flavored non-dairy creamers. I love the decor of the restaurant. It is a pleasant atmosphere as long as you are not close to the door during winter.       

I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"As someone that does not go out to eat often this was he absolute worst experience of our life. Not much to say because we don't want to waste out time, but in a city of countless breakfast places, stacks and yolks comes out on bottom.  We r in this industry and this place should be avoided at all costs.  Candy  the server was one of many that was lazy, not interested  and even sat down to have her food while we were still  waiting for our food to be completed.  Coffee was not full until I asked and juice was never offered again and never got checked on.  We were confused on who was out sever since many people came to us and we got switched 3 times to 3 different servers. No bueno. The only good part of our meal was Daniel the busser . For being a busser he checked in us more then the actual severs and he showed genuine interest in our concerns.  For first time impressions especially in this city and being 2 employees that work for the strips most luxurious hotels, guests ask us all the time where they should dine in this city off the strip. We get asked by thousands a year, and unfortunately this establishment will not be on our answers to them ;-( 
Promote Daniel. 
Sincelry nahum ."}
{"text":"We have been here a ton of times. Had to write a review hoping the owners take notice. The \"Homemade\" corn beef hash was really the nasty canned stuff that taste/looks like dog food. The meatlover omelet my wife ordered was salty and inedible. Sadly we ordered to go so couldn't send it back to the kitchen. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Busy, busy, busy... Every Sunday when we stop in, there is a line. Once you are seated, the service is quick and efficient. Everyone works together here to ensure the customers are well taken care of. The pancakes are delicious, though don't order more than one. They are plate size. Throw in some bacon and oj and I am a happy camper. My boyfriend likes the gravy and biscuits, though he will change up his order."}
{"text":"This morning was our first time here and wow why haven't we tried this place sooner? I can't wait to go back and already have my next meal picked out. The service was superb and the craftsmen ship of our meals was amazing. The portions are huge and delicious. The restaurant itself has a clean modern look throughout. It's very small, maybe 20 tables total? We got lucky and went on a weekday right when it opened but I have seen lines outside on the weekends."}
{"text":"The servers were nice but they got one of my friends order wrong, I asked for whipped cream on my pancake but gave me cream cheese whipped. I let them know it okay only because I didn't want to wait for a new one. I'm from out of town but I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing, and the staff was just delightful.  The food was great, and it came out so efficiently.  Friendly servers and good food?  That's an A in my book.  I will be seeing these people very soon!"}
{"text":"Cute, modern breakfast spot on Durango. This place is tiny though, from the tables to lack of space, I would suggest going early to avoid waiting. The staff appeared to be mostly high school/early college students but they were all so polite and attentive! They have some delicious sounding pancake creations but I am never a sweet person in the morning. I did notice they offer protein pancakes though, which is something I might consider next time! We ordered our food and it was out within 10 minutes, they really hustle back in the kitchen. Overall I really enjoyed my breakfast & experience here!"}
{"text":"My first visit here was decent, standard american breakfast with pretty good service. I couldn't remember much about the food so my boyfriend and I decided to come back and give it another go. 

Our second visit was much worse. We agreed to sitting outside since the restaurant was relatively busy but received the worst service. Our waitress never came to check on us and we received zero refills on our coffee after asking the staff member who delivered our food (which also came out close to 45 minutes after we placed our order) and also attempting to wave down our waitress. She came by to drop off our check and left immediately after before we could say a single word and never came to pick up our bill.

Eager to leave and disappointed at the extremely poor service, we went inside and asked another staff member to run our check. I try to be lenient when places are busy or if perhaps our waiter/waitress is having a bad day but this was one of our worst experiences at a restaurant. Though the food was decent, we won't be returning here again."}
{"text":"Ummm yum! Awesome breakfast place. My family loves the different specialty pancakes. They have gluten free pancakes that are delicious. I love the skillets. They do to go orders over the phone too and are always ready in 10-15 minutes which is awesome."}
{"text":"The thing I love most about this place is everything is fast. You get seated fast and the food comes out fast. But it for sure does not lose its taste. I've been here multiple times and have not be let down yet. So if you want good food and nice help stop on by."}
{"text":"This post only deserves the stars that it does because my experience with the food has been good. The food that I have tried is delicious. However, I have never actually dined inside the restaurant, I've only ordered for pick up through the phone. This is only my second time ordering today and the service and attitude is the worst with these employees. Today my experience was calling in to order. The first order was their steak tips. The first guy who answered said they didn't have steak tips so I said ok give me a moment let me look at the menu again to choose something else. The first guy who answered said in the background to another employee \"hey can you take their order?\" Another man answered. I said \"just one moment please.\" And in the background noise I heard the employee say \"GOD!\" How inappropriate. Not even a minute later, with such a confused look on my face I told them I was ready. Then he said \"well I need you to hold on now\" and he put me on hold for 2 minutes. I honestly think it was on purpose. So I tried to be nice as I told him my order. They never repeat the order to confirm nor take a name down for someone to pick up the order. They said it would be ready in 15-20 min so my boyfriend left to go pick our food up. He proceeded to tell me that this place is a joke. He walked in not greeted and nobody spoke with him and cashier was running around people. Good service and good food makes a person want to return. Horrible service and good food will make a person never want to go back. So thank you for proving to me why I shouldn't go back. They have horrible service and their employees are NEVER kind."}
{"text":"First time here ,  it was absolutely amazing the food was great the philly steak skillet was so good ! And the biscuit and gravy was to die for I'm super picky with breakfast gravy but this was ahhhhmazing my boyfriend tried the infamous red velvet pancakes definitely scrumptious and the whole staff was so friendly .love the vibe of this place ! Can't wait to come back :)"}
{"text":"No. Not this place. Never again. Especially for their consideration for the handicapped.

1) There are NO handicapped parking slots and VERY limited parking unless you want to park in the larger lot behind the building.

2)  It's impossible for the owner to have missed the handicapped person with me: she was in a wheelchair, yet he went past the 2 closest (and 2-person EMPTY) tables to a 4-person table at the farthest corner of the room.  We had to be VERY careful as the pathway was very crowded and narrow.

3)  Their food was generous in portion size, though the price demanded it.  $$

4)  For cranberry-orange pancakes to show up with blueberries in them is insufferably poor cooking skills.   And, the pancakes were very doughy and bland, even with the pseudo-berries.

5)  The wait was not the best we've seen. Other folks, who arrived well after we did, got served similar plates at the same time we did. (And, not they were not orange-cranberry pancakes.)

6)  The décor was right out of a fun-house horror movie with badly strung lights. Holy crap, dude: hire a REAL interior decorator!

7)  My wife told me that she read about the owner telling patrons to get out if they didn't like the service/food.  If true, this place won't last any longer than a summer flood in Vegas."}
{"text":"The only reason I give 4 and not 5 stars is because of the inefficiency of how runs. Lots of back and forth with all the staff.  It could be streamlined and run a little better. Super friendly staff, fun and nice to talk to. 
Delicious food."}
{"text":"We ordered red velvet pancakes, their egg benedict, and meat lover scramble. I personally don't like their hollandaise sauce. It was very oily and separated. The meat lovers scramble is delicious though. It's definitely loaded with meaty goodness. As for their pancakes, they are HUGE!! They are made to be shared. The pancakes weren't bad, but they weren't the best."}
{"text":"I loved the Always November Pancake with eggs over easy and bacon! My friends however hated everything not too sure why! It was all good but they're picky. Maybe it's the area it's in, but I loved it. I tried Stacks and Yolks at Bite of Las Vegas and finally got to go in and really try it!"}
{"text":"Awesome BIG pancakes, and many different choices to chose from! A bit of a small atmosphere but a great spot to check out! Definitely go on a weekday, Sunday and Saturday could face LONG lines."}
{"text":"Wonderful family spot!

I always see families with children here. They have some decent portions for all their dishes. Pretty traditional breakfast food. Great service as well!"}
{"text":"Tried this location while visiting Las Vegas. The building was not so appealing but was comfortable once inside. It was a large restaurant with plenty of seating. The food comes in large portions and is tasty. Try the blueberry lemon pancakes, yum!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but the service was extremely slow. As far as pancakes go, this place has nothing on Babystacks. 

It presents as a family restaurant but there are no changing stations in the bathroom so I had to change my son in the floor. Egg Works a mile or so away is much better and if you're willing to drive, Babystacks is worth the quick trip."}
{"text":"Decided to try them again after our last visit when I had to send my food back twice to get it right. Will never go back. Prices went up 20-30% and the service got worse. We try to support local business, but this one will not see any more patronage from us."}
{"text":"The only reason why I can't give this place a 5 star rating is the SERVICE. I've been there 3 times now and only once was the service ACCEPTABLE, the other 2 times it was HORRID. The customers shouldn't have to ask for a waitstaff to take their order and ask for place settings, or refills on there coffee and water or \"to go\" boxes. An attentive waitstaff should be in top of it, anticipating their customers needs. There's NO REASON for this BAD of service. I really love the food though, especially the skillets. So far there hasn't been anything I didn't like. The portion sizes are generous and the flavor combinations are excellent. My boyfriend and I especially like the outdoor seating available. It just sucks that the service is so BAD."}
{"text":"I come here regularly and only one waitress ever gets it right (Mariah) I love her!!! Today Marisa provided by far the worst experience ever! All I ever order is the three egg breakfast with extra crispy hash browns. One would think this a simple order but after being there for a entire hour I left without even eating. First she brought out my breakfast before my sister who was with me got her meal which was a soggy chicken melt that she didn't eat much of. Marisa apparently didn't hear me the three times I said extra crispy hash browns when I ordered and brought me home fries. About 30 minutes later she brought me back non crispy hash brown and what looked like dried out shrunken eggs. When she asked if that was ok I asked her for a percentage off the bill for such inconveniences because I wasn't going to wait again for her and the cook to get it right. She said she was alone so she didn't know what she could do. At that point I gave my plate back and told her to forget it. She took the plate with nothing else being said and walked away. When I asked her name she said \"they left me alone and I had to restock.\"  I almost forgot to mention that she forgot to bring me my tea and I had to ask her again for it. Total the whole time we where there she waited no more then four tables so no excuses to either Marisa or the cook. She needs a new profession quick because this regular is not coming back again. Sorry Mariah I'll miss you! You always toke such good care of me but it's only you who ever gets it right and I'm just totally over it."}
{"text":"I don't know why but I love going out for breakfast!

I met a friend here during the week hoping it wouldn't be too busy.  For a Wednesday brunch time, it was still pretty full and I was lucky to get a table.  Having a table near the open kitchen area, I was eyeing up all of the delicious food being prepared.  Our waitress was fairly attentive throughout our meal.  My coffee cup never went empty which is always a bonus in my book.

My friend and I decided to split the Crab Cake Benedict breakfast as well as the Always November Stack.  The crab cakes had a light breading topped with perfectly poached eggs.  The yolk just oozed onto the plate satisfying to the eyes.  The taste did not disappoint with a savory and fulfilling flavor. It wasn't overly sauced with hollandaise so you could enjoy the flavors that create this benedict.  

On to the sweet stuff: Ordering the 'Always November' stack will prepare you for fall with the pumpkin batter pancakes stopped with whip, cinnamon and drizzled with a cream cheese frosting.  The pancake size are a larger size which made me happy we only went with the short stack (2).  

Our breakfast was filling and delightful.  Since breakfast is the most important meal of the day you might as well stop into Stacks & Yolks for a happy morning!"}
{"text":"The food was great, and I definitely plan on giving this place another go, but it came out really slow.  It took forever to get our food.  The service was good except for that. 
Maybe my next experience will be different."}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE Stacks and Yolks and have been regular customers for the past five years. I went in to pick up a to go order just now, the young lady that took our order over the phone didn't even acknowledge my husband and I at all. She past us by three times and even had a spare moment to socialize with the hostess. We waited for someone to assist us for ten minutes. It wasn't until two other guys walked in to pick up an order that she looked past us and asked them if they were there for pick up... Again no hello, how are you, how can I be of service Nothing?! I then looked at her to let her know we were there for pick up too! So disappointing"}
{"text":"Brandon helped make breakfast that much more awesome. Great food! Definitely watch the size of pancakes. It's easy to get more than you can eat. Lol"}
{"text":"Great service. The breakfast is great portions and feels like home!
Love the decor! Might be my favorite breakfast place!! Apple cinnamon pancakes are great! So many pancake options!"}
{"text":"We just visited the stacks and yolks on North Jones the food was really good (good kitchen staff) however servers did not use universal precautions  the two servers were on their cell phones (our phones go everywhere with us these days)and handling the toast no gloves handling money no gloves it was not a great experience also one server was running her hand through her hair and the other wiping at her nose and not once did server check to see how we were can't say I would feel comfortable eating there again"}
{"text":"This place is okay. Thoroughly okay. The menu is very confusing and needlessly complicated first off, second cheap simple breakfasts are nearly absent on it- even Denny's and IHOP have these choices. The service is so slow. I feel like a sucker for tipping them sometimes. Good luck if you like more than one cup of coffee. Overall a very mediocre and clunky restaurant. They need to simplify the menus and sharpen the service."}
{"text":"Old review: 
Great local spot for breakfast.. service is awesome. The owner is ALWAYS there shaking hands and talking to customers. Treats you like family! Biscuits have been cold a time or two but still good. 
Bonus: Brandon from the challenge works here :)

New review:
Service just isn't the same.. A little boy took our drink order.. And the food takes so long to come out.  It is good don't get me wrong but If you're in a hurry don't go here for breakfast. The owner isn't as friendly.. Used to walk table to table and ask how things are.. Now he parks right in the front (I get u have a nice car, but customers should come first) comes in for a few minutes then stands out front to smoke (seriously right in front of the restaurant and there was a child eating outside) before leaving..
Guess that's what happens when you make money. Sad"}
{"text":"Accidentally saw this place on our way home after dropping my dog at the vet. We just want to try something new. The experience was good from the beginning to end. The pancakes were delicious and so is the bacon and eggs. Brandon was awesome explaining the deal with their menu. He even gave us a taste of his favorite pancake. Andrew was awesome too. Really polite and very attentive. I'll recommend this place to my family and friends!"}
{"text":"Good food and service each time we have gone. A bit pricey but for convience and food quality hard to complain!"}
{"text":"Filthy place..tables, floors, chair legs are black and greasy towards the bottom, menus, bathroom so greasy & hasn't been cleaned since I don't know when. In desperate need of deep cleaning! Food mediocre, coffee tastes weird and buttermilk pancakes strongly taste like baking soda..Blech! Won't be back ever!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. It was busy, which I thought was a good sign, and the host told me to expect a wait of about 10 minutes. Closer to 30 minutes later, I was seated. My table was unfortunately positioned where anyone coming in or out from my side of the restaurant had to squeeze past, knocking around anything sitting on my table. This did not seem to be a problem at other tables, though, so it's probably bad luck on my part.

Service was horrendous. I waited another 15 minutes to order, requested a coffee refill 3 times before someone brought coffee, and it took about 20 minutes to get my overcooked meal. The person who took my payment was gone for a long time, and when the table beside mine asked what happened to THEIR payment, they gave my card to them.

Food was edible but overcooked and a little bland. I won't come back."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in awhile due to the fact that every time we go there's a long wait and the customer service sucks. I decided to give it another try today and again disappointing. I will NEVERRR come back!!!!! We walk in and there's no wait and isn't busy. Maybe 5 tables.It seemed promising. Nope. The hostess approached us and brought us 2 coffees. We then sat for 15 min and our server hadn't been over to take our order so I asked hostess if they could come over bc we were ready and she said they would be over shortly and still no one came to take our order.  I asked for the check to pay for our coffees and simply said \"sorry.\" As I'm paying for my check the family of 4 behind us also got up and asked to pay for their juices bc they also had been waiting forever. The server said sorry and not to worry about it. I handed him my check and said \"thank you !! I'm so glad their drinks got taken care of for the wait but not mine.\" This place continues  to disappoint and I'll never make the mistake of coming back again"}
{"text":"Took my Grandma/Grandpa here and we waited for over an hour and 15 minutes for our food. I wouldn't say it was super busy but they literally told people after about 45 minutes to leave when they walked in because the wait for food would be so long. They had plenty of tables open. Just super understaffed. Not their fault but nonetheless. 
When we got our food it was actually cold? The pancakes were hard? Cold and hard. The wait staff was nice, but looked
Super stressed. I knew I should have gone to Babystacks. This was my second time there and first time was no different. Thought maybe they were having an off day the first time. Second visit was worse."}
{"text":"My husband, friends and I figured out there were over 10 billion kinds of pancakes you could choose from. How is this possible? There are ten different batters and 11 different toppings. The possibilities are endless!

They have plenty of standard breakfast choices - eggs, bacon, etc - their fresh squeezed orange juice is too good to be true, and their portions (all freshly cooked and delicious) are generous without being overwhelming.

Did I mention the pancakes?"}
{"text":"When the food is good and you're happy that its close to home so you don't have to drive a million miles away, you eat everything!!"}
{"text":"A popular breakfast spot! 

We arrived on a Sunday at 2pm and this place closes at 3pm so we were very surprised to see a line and we ended up waiting about 15 mins in the rain so I was really hoping the food would be outstanding. 

The small restaurant is very colorful and has a fun vibe so things started off well. We both ordered freshly squeezed orange juice and it was fantastic with the perfect amount of pulp. Next came our egg breakfasts, mine with bacon and his with ham. The portions are huge here and both plates were very delicious, no complaints and we would definitely order them again. 

Now to the disappointments. I ordered a single stack of the lemon & blueberry pancake and it was very dense, no fluffiness, no moisture and no lemon flavor. The portion was huge but I didn't want it :(
Next came the single portion of the French toast which again was dense and covered in cinnamon which wasn't pleasing. Both sweets left us regretting we ordered them. 

The service was fantastic and our waiter was a funny one which I always love. 

I hope someone reads this who can make improvements on the pancakes & french toast. 

Overall we enjoyed ourselves except for the sweets."}
{"text":"Nice and quiet place. The waiter was very attentive to our needs. Many visits to the table and nothing was missed. The food was hot and my teenage daughter enjoyed the music that played in the background."}
{"text":"I don't review much but this place isn't worth it. The pancakes are the opposite of light and fluffy, the coffee is watered down, and the skillets are under seasoned. They do have a nice sized menu so maybe it's only the six items a friend and I ordered that were bad."}
{"text":"I ordered a protein burger because I'm on the HCG diet and it was bomb. You can even get it with chopped sautéed peppers. We went around 7 and there weren't too many other people in there. Maybe they could offer a night owl special for those of us who enjoy breakfast for dinner! Server was sweet. My son was particularly fond of her. I think her name was Jessie or Jessica. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've visited the other location and had a great experience. I was just as happy here. The service was fast, the food was great and everyone is always friendly. I had the lips pancakes with extra whipped cream cheese and they were amazing! The portion was large but I could not stop eating they were so good. My daughter had the pumpkin. I am not the biggest fan of pumpkin anything but she ate every bite. We will definitely be back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"STACK AND YOLKS IS GOOD. NOTHING EXCITING. 

My honey and I have been going to Egg Works and The Egg and I lately and this place is tasty plus we always know (with the egg up or down) we will get good service. We recently tried Stacks and Yolks on Warm Springs and Durango and it was so-so. Very busy in there! About 10-15 to sit down but the tables are SO CLOSE TOGETHER that you can barely move (my purse got knocked off my chair several times). The servers definitely have a hard time moving around in there. We enjoyed the large portions - pretty awesome! The Strawberry Pancakes, sausage patties and eggs are good. I don't feel like it was anything to boast about but good. 

Ps. I don't get why everywhere we go with \"Best of Las Vegas\" on the window makes us excited but when we try the place, we think... but why?? Hmm."}
{"text":"Great service. Pancakes are huge and about 3/4 in thick. Soft and fluffy with every flavor and topping you can think of, even meat stuffed! I had the corned beef hash. The ground kind, which is what I like, but they also have the home made shredded kind. Pretty busy place for breakfast so there may be a short wait but worth it."}
{"text":"Great hangover food or breakfast for anyone craving classics or pancakes with a twist. I had a skillet breakfast and it was perfectly greasy, my friends had that day's special and the breakfast burrito. Once our food arrived we couldn't talk because we couldn't stop eating. Friend staff too!"}
{"text":"Excellent food & breakfast. Coffee was very hot. Very clean place.  Huge point there. Red velvet pancake was excellent and the omelette was done just right. Will be back soon with more family."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of hype about this place and thought my boyfriend and I would give it a shot.  We went around breakfast/brunch time and it was slammed packed busy. All places that have good breakfast/brunch typically are busy. Walked in and it was quite small but we were seated right away.  Everyone was SUPER friendly and nice however customer service was super slow but that was because the waiter said that he was the only one out on the floor.  YIKES!! They did have clean up crew to bus out tables for the next customers but for just having one person out on the floor with it being packed on the weekend is tough - With that being said it took a while for us to receive our food & beverage order. When the food came I wasn't impressed - Lacked flavor, quality of food wasn't fresh. Everything was just tasteless. Definitely wouldn't be my first choice. I would put this place on a back burner unless we were in the area."}
{"text":"Breakfast, the best meal of the day! 
Solid choice when I'm in the southwest side of town. If you're a pancake lover, you'll love this place. I usually opt for a make-your-own omelet and potatoes on the side. Egg whites for me please. There's always a wait but you won't be waiting too long. That's what I love about breakfast. People have things to do and places to go. Eat and go, keep the line moving. Now you have time to burn off those calories at IKEA...if you have the time, of course. ; )"}
{"text":"This place is so cool and totally different from your basic breakfast food place! They're food is ridiculously delicious! Good price good location. I got the potatoes with steak and a fried egg on top! Their pancakes are really good as well!!"}
{"text":"Sadly, I have to give this place 2 stars... I was excited to try it out especially since they have gluten free options but after today's visit, I think it's necessary. The whole experience was frustrating and I was disappointed that none of the staff seemed aware to how poorly they were doing. Here are my major complaints:

1) We stood \"in line\" to be seated at the makeshift hostess stand (out front)for about 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. At that time another 2 top had also walked up and was hovering a bit closer to the HS. She immediately greeted them and when my husband mentioned we had been waiting awhile before them she responded with an \"Oh\" and just took our name.  

2) We were told the wait was 15 minutes... We waited 45. This could have been somewhat avoided too. I noticed several un-bussed tables that sat unattended for a good 10-15 minutes.  

3) Once we were seated everything went relatively smoothly. Greeted quickly. Drinks came out in phases but relatively quick. Staff was a bit stand off-ish and obviously confused about quite a bit. I have dietary restrictions (allergies) so I feel like I'm playing Russian roulette when servers seem confused by my questions. 

4) This isn't really related to us but I find it disgusting... The table next to us sat dirty for nearly our entire meal and the \"hostess\" kept piling other dishes from different tables onto it. Both unprofessional and gross. 

Food was ok, not my favorite and was definitely not played to be appetizing to look at. The check was dropped off without a thank you or any real acknowledgement. Our entire time here was over 2 hours because of the set backs. All in all, I really wanted to like this place because it is a locally owned small business but I doubt I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Horrible service, we waited for one hour for our food,  the food never arrived and no one took the time to apologize for the delay, everyone was so rude , we saw the owner he never approached us or the other costumers and explain the situation he just left, if the owner doesn't care why ghe workers should care? worst experience ever never go there!"}
{"text":"I just had breakfast this morning, the servers were AMAZING! The manager was awesome! Food was good. Then it was check out time. Our total was like $23 gave $30 wanted change. It took at least 20 minutes to get the change, Maybe more. I called my wife shortly after turning in my ticket.l, went back to look at the call log,l. Sure enough it was 15 mins. After I had asked multiple times for the change back. They were only taking cash. So I needed change to leave tip. The OWNER ( not sure his name, but his pictures are posted on the shrine for him)he was running the register. So in this 20+ min span, I watched him walk to the back at least 3 separate times. Finally the manager could see my frustration so he stopped what he was doing to get my change. Sucks because I've been here before and had a good experience. But this time was horrible."}
{"text":"Just order the waffle.  Thank me later."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Honestly nothing exceptional given the options in the area.
 The major problem with this place is a completely disorganized kitchen and inattentive staff. It took between 45-60 mins to get our order out, one of which was wrong, we took it anyway because we didn't want to wait another 45 mins. We werent the only ones. If we hadn't seen the people in front of us get their order 10 mins before we actually got ours we would have walked out. The table seated after us did. 
The manager (I'm assuming) was apologetic, however no communication about our order, wait time, etc. From the staff or mgmt. No quick snack to hold over the customers while the kitchen gets it's shit in order. 
Bottom line, I won't waste my time or money here again."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and I am definitely coming back again! I was looking for a quick brunch place, and this is where I ended up! and oh boy! was i happy!!!

When I went, there was no line (around 30 minutes to closing time). The man at the counter was very friendly in going over the menu and what they specialize in. Even upon entering the restaurant, all of the waitresses were UBER friendly and nice, Everyone said good afternoon and smiled. 

So cool note - they marinate their corn beef hash in new castle beer!! At first, I was hesitant because I'm not a fan of the dark beer, but you cannot even taste the beer yet the corn beef was so flavorful. It was different, but in a good way. I got the corn beef hash, egg whites, biscuit and gravy, and hash browns - this was for two by the way haha 

I hear that it can get pretty busy here early in the morning, so it's best to come as early as possible. But it is worth it!!!!!! This has definitely become one of my favorite breakfast spots eben though I have yet to dine in - I took my food to go. Oh, and the portions are pretty big.

Definitely coming here more often!"}
{"text":"Visited Stacks and Yolks for the first time today and the food was delicious and plentiful!  The service was prompt and attentive, and the restaurant was clean. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant.  I tried it once and now I have breakfast there once a week.  Not only is the food great, but the orders are reasonable.  Single stack french toast to go with my bacon and eggs? FINALLY!!! Whoever made the menu \"gets it\".  Sometimes you want french toast or pancakes but you don't want ONLY that as your meal.  Brandon, one of the servers, really ties that place together.  I'll keep going back.  Show up early!  The seats go quick on the weekends."}
{"text":"I usually have a good experience in this place, but today was disappointing, toast was hard as a rock, it tasted old and looks like it was a reject from another table, my coffee was warm and refills was nonexistent, the section I was setting smells like urine, so maybe it's just one of those days, consistency is the key so guest will continue to come back..."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best places for service & food anywhere!!  A restaurant that not only has quality, deliciously prepared dishes, but cares how your complete dining experience is. Pancakes are light and fluffy, hot eggs (perfect and not greasy), toast (perfect), home-fries (real potatoes cooked perfectly, not tater tots like so many of the other \"Egg\" places in the valley).  Coffee is poured hot, fast and frequently. (again, like so many other places where you have to constantly beg for another cup) the coffee keeps flowing here. Stacks & Yolks is the trifecta of a great restaurant: Great Food, Great Service, Great value.  Fresh food served promptly - and they genuinely care about your dining experience. I think we found our new favorite!"}
{"text":"integrates modern sterile envirinment with good 'ole American brekfast. pancakes are \"Killer\" but and large but camouflaged underneath was one that had 1/4 cut off and missing. Incidental? Hard to say because first time there. Service was prompt, especially since only one waitress was working, food well prepared as well. although it lacks the diner ambiance, will likely return."}
{"text":"Got seated right away and ordered but food took almost an hour to get and it was disgusting. The chicken fried steak taste like dog food. Waitress didn't seem to care that we weren't happy about the food or the service. Coffee was the only good thing. We'll never eat there again."}
{"text":"Service is great, resturant is very clean and food is tasty.  Red Velvet pancakes are to die for.  I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Honestly I was a bit disappointed...i waited about 20 mins for a table (no big deal) and was told they were cleaning off a table and I would be seated next. The hostess then came back and said someone decided to seat themselves at our table and it would be another few minutes. By this time I was just hungry and annoyed. We were then seated and our food took over 30 minutes. I felt extremely rushed by our waitress and it was so crammed in there. The food was not even worth the wait.....i won't be back."}
{"text":"I don't know where the dissatisfied diners ate, but I found Stacks n Yolks to be perfectly delightful.  The service was fast and friendly.  The food was well prepared and tasty and we got multiple refills on our coffee. The facility was clean and I really liked the multicolored wood wall. 

I often have a problem with restaurant prepared breakfast potatoes being too greasy for me.  The potatoes that came with my Eggs Benedict were just right and the poached eggs were properly done. My daughter's breakfast skillet was also very nice.  It must have been good since she wasn't able to finish the whole thing and took the leftovers home with her. 

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service is always awesome and the breakfast is amazing. Come here at least 3 times a week just for the bacon and eggs, and it's great every time."}
{"text":"Red Velvet Pancakes is sinfully good!!Service was good! Price is very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Got there sat down right away. Waitress came after a 15 min wait at the table. They are short staffed. They need more waitresses and cooks I think. We waited 45 min until we got our food. Pancakes outstanding! Eggs were cold and bacon was really fatty. I will order it again but to go. We loved the pancakes but not the service."}
{"text":"We have been to the other stacks and yolks and it was great so we decided to try out the cheyenne/Jones location. We went on a Saturday morning and it was a short wait which was nice. The waitress was good initially but after we got our drinks no one came to check on us for more coffee until we flagged someone down. It took over 30min for us to get our food. My bacon was over cooked almost burnt. I ordered my eggs over medium and got them runny. My husband ordered his eggs over easy and got his over medium. The meals weren't as good as the other location. But I do understand they are new and still getting the groove so we will try it again to see if it was just an off day."}
{"text":"I had the gluten free veggie scramble and a single stack of the lemon blueberry pancake. I had the veggie scramble mostly because I am just trying to eat healthier, not because I need gluten free. That being said, I somewhat expected it not to taste all that great. It actually turned out pretty good. The blueberry and a lemon pancake was absolutely phenomenal. I didn't expect the pancake to be so large. It's a good thing I only got one. Service was not too bad.  There's a bunch of \"kids\" working there and they can sometimes be easily distracted but, they do a good job."}
{"text":"Where to begin...

What was supposed to be a 20-minute wait for our group of 5 ended up being a solid hour. 

I ordered the crab cake eggs benedict. When it finally arrived nearly 45 minutes later, the eggs were overcooked and the crab cakes were undoubtedly frozen, store-bought and probably made with imitation crabmeat. They tasted like high school cafeteria fish sticks. Furthermore, it wasn't until everyone's food was delivered that my friend was told they were out of his entrée, corned beef hash. 

The orange juice and skillet potatoes were good, but that's about it. This restaurant could be much better, but they've got some service and kitchen management issues. I can't say I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"This place was ok food.. now the negative they sat us next to a bucket on the floor that was catching water dripping from the roof.  The water had a terrible stench. We were never asked if we would like to move.  All in all I could have cooked that breakfast at home but the place seemed run down and not cared for.  It's a newer building but the restaurant was DIRTY."}
{"text":"Very sloppy and slow service. When we arrived they told us to sit anywhere but all the tables were still dirty and haven't been cleaned. They didn't bother to ask if we wanted refills on our drinks. We needed an extra plate and didn't get one so my nephew decides to go up to the counter and ask for one because he's hungry.
They gave our check when we were still eating. The list can go on and on. I wouldn't recommend this place. Go somewhere else for faster and better service. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Me and the boyfriend were hungry for breakfast and decided to go to a place nearby the house. We finally decided on trying out Stacks & Yolks. We arrived roughly about 11am. When we walked in we were greeted and seated right away. They had a wide range to choose from but I was in a waffle type of mood. So I ended up ordering the Belgian Waffles. The waffle presentation was definitely pretty and unique that it came out in the shape of a flower. The waffle itself was light  and fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Overall had a great experience and will be returning."}
{"text":"This place is great. It has home feeling and great positive vibe. Food is great. I recommend it"}
{"text":"The food had great flavor. I had the corn beef hash which was tasty. However was way over priced for the portion. Their food cost may have been 20% on my meal. Terrible service as well. One cup of coffee and an uninterested waiter."}
{"text":"Fast service, awesome server, great atmosphere. We arrived when they opened so I didn't have to put up with the wait problems that people are having.

Elvis pancakes 4/5: Peanut butter pancake- stuffed with bacon and topped with bananas.... Deeeeeeelicious.fresh OJ was yummy, over easy eggs cooked perfectly.

Benedicts 4.5/5: hollandaise was good, hash had good flavor, eggs cooked well but could've been more runny."}
{"text":"I came here with 3 of my fellow workers for breakfast and I have to say this place ROCKS!!!  The server was attentive and very pleasant and he gave us recommendations that were outstanding.  I had the Portuguese Sausage with eggs and hash browns and it was so yummy!   My colleagues had eggs Benedict and meat lovers pancakes and an omelette and they all loved the food!  I for sure will be back. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"The owner Baja and staff are super friendly and very personable. This is my one of my favorite breakfast spots in town due to their specialty pancake batters. The batters come in hot cakes as well as waffle form. My absolute favorite is their pumpkin pancake with cream cheese topping....it's a foodgasm! Also, their marinated steak tips are apparently marinated in \"unicorn tears\" lol. The corn beef hash is homemade and savory. It's a great place to go with pals and or family."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and def better than I expected! The menu has a great variety of things. My daughter got the peanut butter pancakes topped w/ peanut butter and loved them. I got the homemade corn beef hash and poached eggs. The hash was fantastic! I'm always nervous to try it at new places because it's my fav and not that many people do it right ITS WONDERFUL def recommend trying it. My poached eggs were perfect. Service was fast and friendly and prices were just right. We will be back!"}
{"text":"would of given 5 stars for the food.. the low review was for the service. Waited about 5 mins for a table no problem, took about 15 mins for server to greet our table, after we received our food we were pleased very good scramble and biscuit and gravy were delish. No refill on waters and we didn't even see our server for the remainder of our breakfast, the busser gave us our check and dropped off the receipt for me to sign... $32.00 and not even asked if anything was okay or if she could get us some more water... plus my friend was missing her biscuit and gravy we didn't even bother asking anyone where it was b/c they were too busy to bother,.. hopefully next time will be better"}
{"text":"Omg you will get full so BRING AN APPETITE. I ordered the smores pancakes but did a switch and turned it into chocolate cheesecake. I must say.. those chocolate pancakes (full stack) was AMAZING!! My husband have the carne Asada skillet and THAT was soooooo good. If u want to just nibble don't come and waste good food!! Be ready to slip into a good coma."}
{"text":"We had 1 red velvet and 1 coconut pancake, the Arizona, and the crab cake benedict. Everything was good except for the eggs Benedict which was more like hard boiled eggs with hollandaise sauce. Our original server stated that every cook is different and didn't apologize for the over cooked eggs. The other server noticed I cut open each egg and barely touched my food and he offered to bring me more eggs, if it wasn't for him I would have scored this place a 3. I would also come back purely to be entertained by Taylor!"}
{"text":"Small and PACKED but excellent food.  The service was really slow, but they were packed and people just kept coming in.  A couple customers got up to get their own coffee a couple times.  Food was fantastic and we will go back."}
{"text":"This place is just right down the street from me, I come in here at least 3 times a month. The service is good and I love the food. I usually just get my usual though French toast eggs and sausage or pancakes haha. I love little hole in the wall places and this is one of them. I very much recommend everyone to check this place out."}
{"text":"Food was excellent but the service seriously lacked. We were there after 1:30 and the place was pretty empty. Even with 4 servers milling around we had to ask to get order taken and also for the check."}
{"text":"Well, this place for sure lost my business forever. The service was beyond disappointing. 

We get seated.
About 5 minutes later, couple gets seated at the table next to us.
Another 5 minutes later, no interaction with any waitress yet. 
Suddenly, waitress starts taking the couple next to us' order.
We finally get our waitress's attention, and get our order in. 
Shortly after the food is delivered, she drops the check and that was the last we saw of any kind of service. 

I had to get up, ask for boxes, etc."}
{"text":"At one point I heard several radio commercials saying how Stacks & Yolks was the go to spot for the best breakfast. I looked up their menu and saw they had a lemon blueberry pancake batter and I was sold from there.

I got to Stacks and Yolks at about 1pm on a Saturday. They have a random table placed outside and what looks like a hostess station. There was no one manning the hostess station and after an awkward 3 minutes of just standing in front of it I decided to go inside. I approached an employee at a cash register and told him no one was outside, the hostess comes up behind us and seats us right away. The table was very small for me and my friend, so small that I had to place my keys and wallet on the floor. 

The waitress comes over to take our order. I told her I would like the lemon......... And before I could finish saying blueberry she cuts me off and says WE'RE OUT....... No apology or even the common courtesy to let me finish my sentence. I end up deciding on a red velvet pancake and my friend orders an orange flavored pancake and we decide to share a chicken melt. 

The red velvet pancake looks great visually. It's drizzled with chocolate and strawberry syrup. The chocolate however was very bitter and the strawberry sauce was very tart so I ate my pancake the entire with a face like I just sucked on a lemon. The chicken melt comes and also looks very good. The chicken inside the bread had to be about 2 to 3 inches thick so taking a bite and having that much meat in my mouth was very unappetizing. The fries that came with the sandwich were very good and the pancakes
did have a yummy tangy whipped cream. Also it took a solid 45 minutes to receive any of this haphazard food. 

Overall was very disappointed after hearing all the hype. I recommend The Cracked Egg. If you're trying to make a better breakfast choice."}
{"text":"I had time to kill before my appointment so I decided to stop in and grab breakfast. Never been here. I ordered a coffee, protein pancakes (with Nutella, of course) and eggs. The service is quick and I think every employee in here has asked \"would you like more coffee\" or \"how is everything?\"  Amazing service!!! The protein pancakes are not as fluffy as traditional (I fully expected that) but thought I'd mention in case anyone decides to try them. Very tasty!!"}
{"text":"Wait staff was on it... I personally give them a 10 out of 5.... food was great however  my only complaint was my pancakes were cold when they came to the table. However very delicious! The western skillet was fresh and excellent."}
{"text":"Service was on point, great atmosphere. The burrito was amazing! Highly recommend!!!! The red velvet pancakes were a little chewy, but the topping they had was to die for!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for some pancakes at 11:5O am
The bus or girl but our menus and some drinks we sat there till 13 minutes after 12:00pm still no one waiting on us we asked and we never got anybody so we left will never go back again service was awful  was nobody in there three other tables all had food but one and as we were leaving we saw the waitress cleaning the countertop or something I need more help for better help we will not be going back"}
{"text":"Solid food, much like your normal \"diner\" type place without typical \"diner\" decor.
Staff is extremely attentive and friendly, and the food is really good for the price.
I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"The staff  was friendly and efficient. Prices were reasonable. We ordered too much food but worth being full. Kids enjoyed themselves and their \"Happy Face Pancake With 2 Bacon Strips\". Everyone seemed happy to help you. Overall exceptional service. Good start to our Saturday together."}
{"text":"Brandon and Randy were awesome!! Great food and the best customer service. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time coming to this spot....Staff is very friendly and attentive....Food I will give them a big 8 rating....definetly coming back..."}
{"text":"I've usually had a good experience here with good food but this time was absolutely terrible. The service was very disorganized. Multiple different people came over to serve us or rather provided discombobulated service. Clearly not well trained and were reprimanded and berated by managment when customers would get upset. The pumpkin pancakes were terrible bitter and undercooked. We were without service for 15 mins, bypassed multiple times, had to go ask for our check 3 times before I had to just get up and get it. Absolutely ridiculous, horrible service and just a really awful experience. I might not come here anymore. I'll stick with Babystacks."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  Highly recommend chicken and waffles.  The batter on the chicken is absolutely amazing!!!  Not sure if they make chicken fingers out of it but they would be unbelievable!  Note - the waitress doesn't eat meat.  So don't ask if the chicken and waffles are good.  Take my word for it."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre, as our food also took long to come out & my son's food was cold.  Fries were old & full of grease (no potato just crunchy grease) & they charge 3$ just for a fountain drink. To top it off, they never checked on us after we got our food, we had to wave someone down for the check! Will NEVER return there again, very disappointing, as I had high hopes for this place!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast food and good service. 1st time there. Servers very patient while this foody looks over menu. Home style cooking. Coffee ahhh. Not so great. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Service is exceptional. You can tell the employees enjoy what they do.  We opted for the \"unicorn tears\" which is steak marinated in their special concoction overnight, eggs how you like them, potatoes and a biscuit and gravy. Not bad at all, but wasn't worthy of shedding \"tears of joy\" as the waiter suggested they would. Lol.  It was very nicely marinated but steak was a little tough. 

On the other end of the spectrum, we ordered a classic, can't-go-wrong stack of buttermilk pancakes which were delish.  They were huggggeee and more than I could handle."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming in here and most definitely won't be my last. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, and I'm telling you now this place hits the spot. Normally when you walk into a breakfast place and you scroll through the menu and than see the price, you wonder hmmm are the portions big enough or is it small? Is it worth it? I'll tell you right now this place hits the spot. Great portions, fair pricing. The last two times I've been here I've ordered the skillets. All skillets come with 3 eggs and toast. 
The service is great and you get seated right away with a friendly face and a big smile. Id like to keep writing but my food is sitting on my face.. My server was Andrea and she was great and personable"}
{"text":"Today was my first time here. It's a cute breakfast place with good options. Love that they have gluten free items and protein pancakes! The service was good, very attentive. The food was great, I loved the side potatoes! The only thing I didn't really care for was the powdered sugar on top of the pancakes but that's something I can have them leave off next time. By the way, the pancakes were huge! The orange juice is absolutely fantastic; it seemed to be freshly squeezed.  We ate outside so I can't say much about the atmosphere inside. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Can you say ROLL ME OUT?  OMG the food was amazing...my husband loved it so much he goes during the day without me while I'm at work just to get his fix of chicken fried steak (that dog!) 

We go when ever we can with our son on the weekends and love it cause they are so personable with you and serve up some GREAT food you can hardly finish cause they serve you so much....Gotta try them for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I just left there for the first time and it was great! I didn't catch his name but the guy at the counter with the awesome tattoos got my order together for me. Great customer service and the food is good. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and great food. Owner is usually there and is always friendly and helpful. I would strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Gave them 1 star.  Which is very good, putting aside the experience we had. We called and we were 2 min away, gal said there was a 10 minute wait. When we got there, there was a 20 min wait. 
I just want to say, the seating of the customers was so scattered. There was free seats in off places in which could of been connected to create bigger tables. You catch my drift?
We sat and ordered and I unintentionally timed the order to when we were served because I was on hold for an airline. 
When the food came it was about 32 minutes later. I was intermittently asking about the food to the waitress and was told she would check on it. She never came back. 
I asked the owner when our order would be ready and he said he had only one cook and apologized. 
The food was not that great. The turkey sausage was cold and the eggs Benedict and English muffin were very oily. My daughter ordered a make-your-own omelette, and it was basically a scrambled egg with toppings. 
They waitress also tried to tell us that they ran out of sugar. Really?! On a 3 day weekend?  I told her to check again, and what do you know? They had sugar. 

All of this happened and the owner did not even try to ask what they could change to make the experience better. 
No way are we recommending this place."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and people itself deserve 5 starts.. What a great bunch of friendly happy people.. And in Vegas that's RARE these days... I'd make my way back a couple times a week but it's a little too pricey for that but perfect for a random breakfast morning... The French toast was on point.. The orange juice was way too thick for my liking- I felt like I was eating an orange... From a cup. The ordering and paying process is a bit confusing, you're not sure if you sit down and wait or go up to the counter.. We woulda sat there for an hour ready to go if we didn't see other people walking up to the register... But all in all it was good and I'll be going back =)"}
{"text":"This is a lovely restaurant for breakfast! We arrived relatively early on a Saturday morning, so there was no wait. We were able to choose our seats in this small restaurant. They also have outside seating. 

 The service here was fantastic- super friendly, and multiple people checked on us throughout our meal. 

I created my own omelette with chicken, mushrooms, and cheese, and it was yummy. The breakfast potatoes, however, didn't have any seasoning, so they were a bit of a disappointment. The toast was just fine. My coffee was refilled several times, and the pricing was quite fair. If you are ever in the neighborhood for breakfast, I'd recommend Stacks and Yolks."}
{"text":"My friend got the Arizona and I got the Crab Cakes Eggs Benedict! 

The Arizona is on point for anyone wanting something with an extra jalapeño kick in the morning, and the Eggs Benedict was cooked to perfection. The portion sizes were obviously huge both my friend and I had to bring left overs home which was fine. 

This place is definitely a bit more on the pricey side for a breakfast place, so save up for the splurge when you can afford it. Ended up spending $60 after tip for two people, ouch.

And remember, don't leave without trying their fresh squeezed orange juice... Possibly the best I've ever had, ever. That's all :)

In addition, the third time I've visited they were also VERY nice and cordial to my friend and I and our dogs - which I absolutely can't tell you how much I appreciate. Owners are super rude sometimes but this owner was very open and friendly, which made us feel welcome and tip even higher."}
{"text":"I have been to several breakfast establishments in Las Vegas and Stacks and Yolks gives you that home feeling that others don't. The food is made to perfection. I Highly recommend coming here. I PROMISE you that Stacks and Yolks will live up to my hype as the best breakfast restaurant in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"After driving past this place many times, I was excited to try it. I'm a sucker for breakfast foods, but this place just did not live up to my expectations. 

Walking in, it seemed cozy enough. Many of the tables were occupied, so I figured that since people were eating there, the food must be good. I ordered the chicken fried steak, and that was a mistake. Both the eggs & the steak were overcooked, rubbery, and absolutely had no taste. The tastiest thing on the plate was the gravy, and that was mediocre at best. The prices seem to be a bit steep for the amount of food they give you, as well as the quality of the food. 

The waitress seemed friendly enough at first. However, as the meal went out, the service went down horribly. My friend had to go get utensils for the table, because none were provided for us. Nor were they very good about giving us refills for our coffee. 

Overall, it was a bad experience. I wouldn't suggest going here. There are far better breakfast places to eat at in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food is very good. They give you a big portion so come hungry. 
Our server, Brandon was hilarious and super friendly."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, horrible service and ridiculously high prices make for a horrible experience."}
{"text":"fantastic place to have breakfast. Always a surprise of what the special will be. This morning I had a meet lovers egg and cheese scramble. My favorite pancakes here are the Reeses cup. I was talking about them with Brandon my server this morning. You never know what the special will be."}
{"text":"LOVE the pancakes. Everything else was very good, another standard breakfast spot. Friendly service. Cute decor. Relaxed ambiance. Family friendly. The whole place could use a hot, soapy scrub down. The table, chairs, condiments, and floor had a thin layer of stickiness I could have done without. But I'll definitely be back for those stacks!"}
{"text":"We eat at Stacks and Yolks several times monthly for breakfast or lunch.    The food is always fresh and hot.  They have been consistent in service and food prep. i would recommend it for a good american breakfast.   i noticed last time we were in that they are open for dinner.   My only recommendation is that they clean the glass windows and especially the entry door. There are times when staff is just standing around visiting and that area should be kept up.  The first impression is that dirty door glass and windows!"}
{"text":"I use to like this place however when I came here today I was very disappointed.   Service was VERY SLOW and there are hardly any people in here.  I ordered eggs over medium and they came out hard.  The guy never came back to check on us.   But the most disappointing thing was how Dirty the restaurant is.   They don't take any pride in it at all.  The women's restroom was gross and Filthy.  I had to Ask for a clean salt shaker after I checked several tables around me for one.  Nothing more disgusting gassing caked on food on the salt shaker."}
{"text":"Fantastic pancakes - I got the red velvet and also had the deep-fried waffles.  Excellent side of bacon and egg whites cooked exactly how I wanted."}
{"text":"Good, hearty, tasty food that was really seasoned well. To me, well seasoned food is something hard to find in vegas. I'm glad someone suggested this place to me.
Pancakes are huge and delicious and the staff was great. There were a few items on the menu that I will definitely be back to try. 

Got here around 8 and seating was available but by 9 it was packed, I suggest getting here early. The places isn't that big but it is nice. The Decor was cool, not corny like a lot of breakfast places. I had a great experience and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Not sure about this spot yet. Walked in to women restroom bathroom,  they just opened and its pretty gross,  it kind of already grossed me out.  Even to order food.  Sorry but that says a lot about a place. Take pride in you spot."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Food was great,but the African American gentleman server was inattentive and we were the only table there. His serving skills were on par with potato!"}
{"text":"I've visited a few times before, but today was a bad experience. I went in around 12:30pm with my boyfriend. We were greeted by a woman who was at the register and instructed us to sit anyone we'd like. There were at least 6 tables open but almost every single one was dirty. We had no other option than to sit at an awkward table in the middle of the restaurant next to a big party. Two different people came to ask for our drink order and food order. Staff was not on the same page. Food was alright. Our omelettes were supposed to be served with toast, but we didn't get any toast. Never got refill on coffee. Apple juice was served in a tiny (probably 4 oz) mason jar. Restaurant was obviously under staffed. I will probably not dine here again. Definitely not worth the money we spent."}
{"text":"Love this place! My family and I have been regulars here ever since I was little. The food is always amazing and the staff are so friendly! The owners are the best!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. We sat and 20 minutes went by...6 tables sat around us (thats how slow it was)... We got up and then some RUDE server (African american man with a beard) LIES to my face and says there is no manager, after the host JUST told me there was. I will spare u the rest of our useless convo and sum it up with he was a complete jerk! He didn't care at all that we had been waiting for 20 minutes and the TWO tables he just greeted were sat 10 minutes after us. His excuse \" i didnt know the order of people sat\". Well then coming from someone who knows F&B get your stuff together and communicate with your host staff who's seating so your service doesn't completely suck! He just had excuse after excuse and not one apology. FYI server guy dont be an absolute jerk when your PAYING, repeat patrons are upset that you basically just shafted them and just said you dont matter to their face!!

I had read reviews that the service has gone down a lot and the staff is rude but being a repeat customer for years I didnt really believe them. Sidenote i had a few unpleasant experiences here my last couple visits, but i always chalked it up to \"its just once and no big deal\" but after today i realize its just the way it is now.

Forget stacks and yolks...Go to baby stacks!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed . We went there last Sunday Aug.6,2017. My first and last. Server looks unhappy. Took a while 10 min before the server showed up. We ask several times for utensils. I order a corned beef hash and I think the cook loaded it with salt . It's horrible and when I told the server he said that he will give me discount or wait for another one. But when the bill came no discount at all. Don't eat there , horrible place ."}
{"text":"Always wanted to checkout this breakfast spot not only cause its close to home. Breakfast food makes some of the best recovery meals for triathlete or getting your sweat on. The interior decor got admit made great first impression really like the modern look with the oversize part menu on one side, and almost jenga building block different colors and sizes on another wall. The main logo has lot of personality and think its cool. I like the open kitchen look and no shortage of tables all bunched together that for sure...

On to the good stuff FOOD. I might have ordered the wrong stuff that not the rave. The pancakes had some buzz so had to get one of those. I love pancakes of any flavor for recovery meal. I settled on the Red Velvet Pancakes. In general love pancakes but if see Red Velvet am all over it. I only got single stack since wanted too try more of the menu. Thankfully ordered single stack. Talk about huge pancake. I would almost venture on size just as big as one had at The Griddle Cafe. But unlike not only The Griddle Cafe but Babystacks. The pancakes here was ok at best even then being nice. I felt like the pancake was too dense, no fluff in them, not nice moist full pancake filling with every bite, and the raspberry sauce they put on top OVERKILL for me. I think those two flavors don't mix. Lets be honest good pancake should stand out by itself! It never worked for me.

Turkey Melt was another nothing really stood out for me. All the components was blah. The turkey meat nothing special just ordinary deli slices, the cheese, and the chili. I did like the bread and the fact cooked it right. The sandwich had nice golden crust and the inside filling was hot with all cheese melted spilling out with every bite. The fries that came with it was another blah. The seasoning on them not figure out was not very good. 

The service was spot on five stars. It more like 3.5 star. The service needs shout out. They were friendly from time walked in, never had empty glass, and explained any questions had since first time perfect. 

Sracks and Yolks is place that will come back try again. It just might have been ordered the wrong stuff off the menu. lol."}
{"text":"Went here for President's day around brunch time and it was fairly busy of course - holiday weekend. The hostess was very friendly, sat right away. The seating situation was kind of uncomfortable, scrunched together. After we sat, we knew what we wanted so ordered fairly quickly. The menu is a good, and easy - breakfast on the front, lunch on the back. After we ordered, felt like we were pretty much forgot about. It took 45 mins to get our food, and no refills on our water. So I would have to say service was lacking. 
When the food came, it was alright - I ordered the minty pancakes and they were kind of dry. The scrambled eggs lacked any salt, but bacon was good ( who can mess up on bacon haha ). I have to say I'm not a fan of this breakfast joint, I probably won't be back anytime soon. :)"}
{"text":"Place is usually busy and the food is pretty good. Menu is basic but they do a good job and I've never had to send anything back. Staff is polite. Only gripe is the space - it's super cramped and there's no waiting area inside. This gets really annoying - especially if they seat you by the door. Poor layout. Otherwise a nice little breakfast place."}
{"text":"Amazing place, amazing food. The people that were working were so nice and friendly from the moment we walked in. I couldn't decide between pancakes and a skillet so she brought us free pancakes! Good was delicious and came out fast. Despite the restaurant being busy our drinks were never empty and they checked back on us often. GO HERE."}
{"text":"I'm always happy when I find a restaurant with outdoor seating for my puppy and I to enjoy.  

No specialty coffees offered here. 

The breakfast selection is great. The servings are large.  Pumpkin pancakes were fluffy and festive. Very sweet. Our service was quick and on point."}
{"text":"Food is good but the wait and service sucks, I can find a better place without the wait.... I mean over 30 min wait for me to get my food?? Seems understaffed, they should have a now hiring sign in the front.... 1 cook and 3 servers...... what a joke!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Service could use some help and the cooking could be better. Coffee was cool tho"}
{"text":"I really don't know why one of my cousins is extremely in love with breakfast here. It was not good, it was not bad. It was \"A-OK\". Service lacked. Maybe that's where some of the dismay resents from? Eh, it could very well be the root cause. Standing in line and waiting to get seated, only to attempt to seat a different party who arrived later than myself. That was annoying. Confusion with what I had ordered... 10 minutes later? That was annoying too. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The food is great, the service attentive and the atmosphere a perfect mix of lively, but not loud. It's like that neighborhood place you see in movies or tv that are only in small towns in the middle of nowhere. I can see myself here a few times a month. 

Oh and the wait staff is VERY easy on the eyes."}
{"text":"I got the red velvet pancakes. They were SO good and the cream cheese icing on top was money! My friend got the ham and cheese omelet which was really good too. Their orange juice is aaaaamazingg!!! I always look for fresh squeezed oj and honestly this place has it!!! Amazing I tell you. The staff was super friendly we had multiple servers check on us which means they work as a team which is great. I'd definitely come again! Ps. Try and get the food truck into Unlv's campus! I'd go there im between classes for sure!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place by driving by since it's close to my house. It's a small place that gives me a California vibe. I like the place because I spotted a celebrity on my 1st visit and then spotted him many times there after. I think he has a stake in this business since he eats here every morning when he's not out filming his MTV show. I also heard him talking business strategies with the owner who has ties to UFC fighting. 
My brother went to school with this celebrity and I'm a big fan of the show he hosts so it's fun to talk with him when he recognizes me. Other members of the MTV show have worked at this location as servers off and on since it opened.
So in conclusion it's a perfectly fine breakfast place but even better if you want to spot celebrities."}
{"text":"Portions are humongous! Don't go here solo unless you can eat for two or three OR if you have been starving all day. Went here for brunch and food was good. I had the crab eggs Benedict with a side of fruit and the red velvet pancake. The pancake tasted more like cake rather than pancake.. But nonetheless still good."}
{"text":"This place is the best breakfast spot in town! My husband and I never have a bad experience. Service is great and the food is always delicious. If you eat here try the Elvis... How can you go wrong with peanut butter pancakes stuffed with bacon and bananas on top! And the Portuguese sausage is my favorite. Great owner, great staff, great service and excellent food.  You won't regret eating at Stacks & Yolks!"}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this place. Unfortunately it fell short on several issues. Tried the blueberry and lemon pancakes and although GIGANTIC were tasteless and dense. My 2 scrambled eggs looked more like 1 small egg and burnt, hash browns were completely tasteless, but the sausage links were tasty. The service was excellent, even though they were jam packed we were seated pretty quick and \"Brandon\", was FANTASTIC. Will try the burger next time. They did remove my pancake from the check."}
{"text":"I love this place. the breakfast is so good. the pancakes are huge and they make cornbeef hash from scratch. If you're ever in the mood for good breakfast..trust me this is the place."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff with small town atmosphere, unfortunately we went at a very busy time, first sat next to bathroom area, smell was horrible, requested to sit somewhere else. Since they were very busy it took a while for food, about 30 mins, blueberry lemon pancakes were very goodgr, chili burger also great, server asked if I would like cheese in scrambled eggs, this cost additional $1, had i known I would have not gotten it. Although the staff was very nice they were so busy that it took a long time for drink refills and food, overall im not sure if I will return since there are so many comparable places with quicker service,  the bathroom smell is what made me drop a star."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! Food is amazing!! They have such an amazing variety of pancakes including gluten free. Their specials are always huge and out of this world! Servers are all super friendly and owner is awesome! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"If you don't have anything else to do and want to spend time doing nothing come here. Food takes forever. At least 1 hour just to eat is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Love this place for a good breakfast any day of the week. It's definitely a great place if you had a battle with alcohol the night before, and the alcohol won.  They have an amazing selection of specialty pancakes, as well as many different breakfast choices. Most of the come with an amazing biscuit and gravy to accompany your meal. They also have a lunch menu I've never ventured into, but the meals do look very appetizing. I've been going here for a while, even before they changed their name to the current one.  I recommend it for your local breakfast stop, much more so than any of the commercial and corner breakfast joints. Go local and support a great place!"}
{"text":"Very fast service! The waitress Anna helped me pick out what I was in the mood for this morning.. very nice girl!! Food was amazing, and made look very pretty on my dish before being served!!"}
{"text":"Not on par with babystacks or any breakfast place I know. Tried the mint chocolate pancakes, and couldn't really taste a hint of mint chocolate chip, although they were green. The deep fried French toast had potential, but still failed as an almost tasteless adventure. The cheeseburger was ordered medium well and was brought out extra well done, and was tasteless as well. After seeing this place on fox5 am news we wanted to give it a try. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has horrible service. Took 20 mins for them to get our order and we realized people who came after us had ordered and got their food. Like WTF was that about.. we took our money to Lumberjacks. The blonde girl said I was there for 2 minutes and that is bull crap. I will never come her again."}
{"text":"I give them one star since the one pancake me and my husband shared was decent. I got the \"turkey gobbler skillet\" and my husband had the steak skillet special they had for the day. With the one additional pancake we got our breakfast was $40.25. For what we got it was not worth it at all and I work too hard for my money to waste it on this place again. I think the lines are purely for people who are not locals. My own breakfast would've been better and I will certainly do that instead of coming here again, no I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"Fantastic pancakes especially the lemon blueberry great skillets we love coming here."}
{"text":"Just went in for breakfast today with a friend and my 4 kids, you should have seen the waitresses face like she didn't want to seat us! 1st strike. We sit down at a table that sits 4 mind you we're a party of 6! We manage because we wanted to try the place out and they were packed so we understood. However, after 20 minutes of waiting for someone to take our order a party in front of us left (approximately 8-10) did they accommate us??? No! Strike 2. Finally, got our order in took another 30-45 minute wait...the food comes and we are NOT impressed! Syrup tasted watered down, my fried chicken had powdered sugar poured all on top like a dressing YUCK and the waffles tasted like old batter half cooked. My kids didn't even eat their food either. Strike 3. Went to pay for the bill and the guy asks me how was my experience? I told him their service was awful and their food was horrible! He then asked me how could they have made it better? Told him his servers need to be more attentive and have better attitudes. Did he comp our food NO! We will not be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place today 5/2/18 first thing we notice is that both our silverware is dirty plus some of them have water spots. We notice the windows appear dirty and got fingerprints on it and it's only 10 am. Looking at the menu items they look overpriced, but we order chicken and waffles. The group next to us leaves. They cleaned part of the table and left dishes on it. The dishes never even got picked up while we were there. A few more tables leave and they never cleaned them while we were there. They tell people arriving to sit where ever, but theres only one table clean. We notice other people that ordered like 20 minutes after us get their order. Then as we were about to leave because we thought they forgot our order the food arrives. We get our chicken and waffles and it was kind of disappointing. The waffles were a single stack and the plates were not even full. Let me tell you this is the smallest chicken and waffles I have ever ate. Kind of overpriced for what you get. They never refilled our water or checked up on us during the meal. All they did is give us a check. Then us and another table give our cards to pay. 15 minutes pass. We notice one of the workers put up a sign that says cash only on the door. They never tell us anything about the one card register not working. We ask whats going on they said they reset the system and don't even know how long it will take. We end up going to the bank to get cash cause we can't wait any longer. It seemed like the one guy server with the beard was the only one doing work the whole time we were there."}
{"text":"I'm being gracious with the two stars... When this place open, it was consistently my favorite new restaurant (around November '15).  Within the last few months, my last three experiences have progressively gotten worse.  Our eggs and my pancakes  were cold. My father order a waffle with NO powdered sugar (which the waitress told us it doesn't come on the waffle); but the waffle still came with it. Once it was sent back to the kitchen, we had to ASK for the waffle 15-20 minutes later. When it did finally come, it was over cooked. There wasn't one water refill during the meal. The staff is friendly but seemingly undertrained and the restaurant is obviously mismanaged. Stacks and yolks have gone from 1st to WORST."}
{"text":"Great food. Homemade corned beef hash was delicious. Owner waited on me personally and portion was huge. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé had our first visit here today and there was no wait. We were immediately seated in a booth and served our drinks. The server wasn't far behind asking if we were ready to order. I got the eggs Benedict and it was so delicious! My fiancé got the meat lovers short stack with a side of eggs and home fries. The pancakes are delicious but he would have been better off with a single stack. He loved everything but I think the potatoes could have been crispier. Definitely will be eating here again!"}
{"text":"I have gotten take out from this place many times and the food has never been a let down for me personally.  The staff has always been very friendly. It does get very busy at times so if you are really hungry on a sat/sunday afternoon you might be in for a wait."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! Brandon, our server, was extremely friendly and really made our experience! We've found it difficult recently to find a breakfast place with both good service and good food but our search has ended here! There's a wide selection of pancakes and other breakfast items and the restaurant itself has a lot of character. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was ok. Had to ask twice for several things, had to ask for refills other places are aware of this and get it for you.  For 3 meals and 3 drinks the price was some high, not sure if I would go back. They were quick in coming for the payment"}
{"text":"My friends and I have been going here since before it became Stacks and Yolks and we love it! I also have breakfast dates with my seven year old son here. Always very delicious food and the staff is always very pleasant. My favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here ordered Kit's hash, eggs bene, and tried the apple cinnamon roll pancakes. Food was ONO!! I would defiantly come back."}
{"text":"Cute little place to get a good breakfast! Staff are friendly and fast. Some of the best hash browns I've ever had too. And they have pumpkin pancakes so the white girl in me will definitely be back!:)"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but the service is awful. Maybe the food just tasted so good because of the gratuitous amount of time we spend waiting for it?

Despite the sheer size of staff for the tiny size of the building, drinks manage to stay empty for an hour before any staff members will remotely make eye contact with you. They pretty much just scale the counter on the side, pretending to look at the ceiling of the room, while totally averting their eyes from the fact you're in need of attention. 

The kitchen took so long to bring the food out that I entirely lost my appetite during the wait. 

Servers hang out with each other way more than they actually work. I'm sure they actually give good service when one of their friends come in. Asking for a coffee refill feels like an absolute burden when one of the 4 servers actually leaves the drive thru window corner from chatting. 

Definitely not coming back here, we'll go to Babystacks instead."}
{"text":"I love this place. My friend and I were HANGRY, and decided we would stop by for brunch. I got the Arizona (I believe), and it was SO GOOD I ATE THE WHOLE THING. I immediately fell asleep when we got to the car, but that is beside the point. 

Our server was great, and we went when the line was nil. My dish was seasoned ground beef and eggs and potatoes and i forget what else, but I took a pic to show you. I also ordered an avocado on the side, because I love avocados. It also came with toast. So in case you don't fill up on the dish, you can fill up on the two pieces of toast!

For two of us, our total was $38; including drinks. So, it was not bad for a huge breakfast. I see there are poor reviews, and I am so glad we didn't encounter those when we were there. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Been coming here since it was called the Griddle!
Cute little hidden gem with great breakfast options. Seems like their portions have gotten smaller but still enough to fill you up.
I like to try their specials since they're different all the time. Prices are okay for breakfast. Nice staff. Clean, cute little place"}
{"text":"Floor is gross. Highchairs are filthy. Seats are stained. The bathroom - don't even ask... The service needed improvement. The coffee was not that great. The OJ was served in a hot (just cleaned) glass.....
The food; however; was pretty good. Good enough, in fact, to have me back again after today. My fries were light and crispy. The bacon and mushrooms on my overcooked burger were good. Streak tips were reported to be delightful. Red velvet pancakes were extremely sweet, but exploding with delicious fruit flavor! The regular pancake was light and tasty. Hash browns here are also stated to be top notch. I won't be touching anything but my food in this greasy spoon but I'll gladly touch that!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food. Consistently bad coffee. Friendly service and fun decor. Well worth a try."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot!! Can't wait until they open in Laguna Nigel!! Great place for kids too and birthdays!! They also have my favorite! Nutella pancakes!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for pancakes so I went with their specialty - red velvet lips pancakes. I hate to say this but I didn't enjoy them. Props for a pretty presentation but without any fluffiness & lacking in the flavor department, I can't say that I'm a fan. I had a bite of my husband's French toast and scrambled eggs and it fell short on flavor as well. Their service was attentive even though they were packed and people constantly refilling my coffee. The only thing I liked was their freshly squeezed orange juice with lots of pulp."}
{"text":"Just moved in area came in with 4 people. i like trying new places great food worst service ever they brought food out never came back to table to check  if everything was alright we had 4coffees never came back to prebuss dirty plates or refill our drinks  wont be coming back. When we were paying bill 2 other couples werent that happy either with servers"}
{"text":"Awesome food and fantastic service... staff where professional polite and quick. Food was great and the price was amazing"}
{"text":"Less then impressive. The food IMO isn't that great I don't understand the hype. I would have to agree with most people that the service is subpar. Waiters have a little attitude and are not that attentive. It was also very pricy in comparison to baby stacks or egg works. I had the philly skillet and it had zero taste. It was like the beef had no seasoning and was just cooked and thrown on a skilled and the potatoes were just potatoes. The pancakes have no flavor and are super expensive for what you get. Dennys is honestly better then this place. If you're looking for good breakfast food in a town like this consider other places. $48 for a skillet two pancakes and eggs Benedict. Not impressive. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic!  I got the peanut butter pancakes and they were just the right blend of rich and fluffy.  My dad got the philly skillet and he said it was really good.  I considered giving them 4 stars because it is a little on the pricey side (the skillet was $12.99), but the food is so good it's really worth the extra $."}
{"text":"Ate here today was not impressed. We order the steak skillet. The potatoes were boiled and had no seasoning. So they tested like boiled water. Tryed to order a chicken sandwich, but they were all out of chicken. So i ordered pancakes  and bacon instead and asked for the bacon wasnt crispy like i asked. They lady said she would  bring me a new order, but never got it. We wont be coming back!"}
{"text":"What can I say about my-hands down-favorite local breakfast spot

I love breakfast so this is a pretty big deal. When we moved to the southwest part of town, we took a shot on the place we had heard about a couple times. My fiancé and I were lucky enough to have the same days off at the time so it became a weekly tradition. While she has stuck to the pancakes for the most part, I have tried to work my way around the menu. I'm a sucker for their skillets though and can't seem to get past them. The hobo being my favorite, I haven't been disappointed with any of them. The steak tips marinated in unicorn tears is also a crowd pleaser.

They run some specials you can find on the whiteboard and I have never been disappointed with those either. The orange juice I believe is fresh pressed.

They ran a fundraiser not to long ago to support some fallen police  officers. The turn out was amazing and it was awesome to seem them do that.

The staff are always friendly and have gotten to know us over time. Just a great all around spot."}
{"text":"If i could give NO STARS I would. Just so you know, I haven't eaten here yet. I wasn't able to get past the wait list. We checked in at 1245 pm on a Sunday afternoon. The hostess said the wait was going to be 25 minutes. LIES! While waiting, a woman said she was also told the exact same thing - that the wait time for a table would be 25 minutes. She was already waiting 45 minutes when we arrived. WHAT?! It's either the food is really good OR she had a lot of time to waste and wasn't really hungry. We had a group of seven hungry people, including 2 kids. 
What really pissed me off (and apparently 6 other people waiting longer than us) is when the manager decided it was ok to seat a group of 12 that just walked in AFTER my group. When I spoke to the hostess, she said that the manager said to seat the 12 top. She was just doing what she was told. WTF?! What about everyone else that was waiting?! 
That shows me that they don't give a rats ass about their customers. Note to the manager working the shift today - Yeah, the food may be good (I wouldn't know), but that won't keep your customers. It's all about the whole experience and how you make people feel. Your food may taste amazing, but I didn't need to try it to already have a bad taste in my mouth about this place."}
{"text":"Nice family type feel. Everyone here seems to know each other. The decor is very welcoming and bright. Only issue we had was coffee refill. We asked for as refill, waited ten minutes, another waitress came by and we asked her for a refill and got it right away."}
{"text":"One of the worst breakfast experiences ever.  Girlfriend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict, you could see the imitation krab in the cakes which they tried to cover my drowning it in hollandaise sauce.  They were Krab Cakes!!   I tried the \"homemade\" corned beef hash, which was canned corned beef with some diced red bell peppers.  Two bites each, we each tried each others and out the door we went.  Sign outside says New Look, New Menu, Same Owner!!! What it doesn't say is same quality of food as before... POOR!!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the quality of food I had. Just tried the basics which was waffles, eggs, and sausage. Staff was friendly and although they were busy we didnt wait long at all for the food.

Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was bland and we waited about 50 minutes for the food. We had empty cups numerous times. Food came out in groups, with kids meal coming about 5 minutes after ours. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Service here was great!! The menu was loaded with great options. Our server was very informative. The chicken on my husbands chicken and waffle was perfectly cook, juicy inside but crispy on the outside. I'm definitely getting that next time! There prices are very reasonable. I only a star off because of my trip to the bathroom. I'll will hold the details but definitely needs to be cleaned at least."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am a weekend breakfast eating fanatic, so my expectations are set a little above average.  In my opinion Stacks & Yolks came in a solid average...I had nothing to complain about per se, but nothing to rave about either.  It was all just okay: food, service, ambiance.  A small place like this lives and dies according to the people that work there, and I don't think we got a very good server...so I try and not hold that too much against them.  If we're in the area we decided it would be okay to go again, so I may have an updated review in the future - with hopefully slightly more enthusiastic results."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch place.
Staff is always friendly and the food is excellent.
The who's who of Las Vegas is generally there having breakfast on any given day.

Personally I go with their egg white omelettes with spinach mushroom tomato and avocado. The orange juice is fresh.

The skillets are huge. You'll never get out of this place hungry!

As for the pancakes, the size is just ridiculous, and they taste amazing.

I'm usually there twice a week with my friends. I love this place."}
{"text":"Dude,
My wife & I have been sitting in this place for 53 minutes...STILL no food. We were initially ignored for 20 minutes before we even ordered. People to our left & right ordered, ate & left over & over again. I really don't know what to say. Wow! I wish that I knew what the food tastes like. The service is zero. They have a challenge where if you eat 10 pancakes & 10 eggs in an hour, you can have the meal for free? What if you don't get food for an hour?"}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's small so there is usually a wait. The waitstaff is super friendly and accommodating. I ordered the Lumberjack, which I will be eating all day! Pancakes, eggs, link sausage and home fries.  Delicious!  My husband had the meatlovers scramble which was also excellent!  Just come early or late to avoid the wait if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing. At first the service was a little slow but always friendly. The service speed has improved by leaps and bounds! The food is always amazing! Sadie is always really nice! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and I love that this is mom and pop type place but I gave three stars because the customer service is okay. When you walk in no one greets you and they are not the most attentive during the meal either."}
{"text":"Foods great and the service has gotten better. They have more staff to handle to crowds of people that come here. I've tried a  quite few breakfast places in town and this one has the most bang for the buck."}
{"text":"My first time there and it was so good. The pancakes were fluffy. Plus they are so huge, I could only eat one. The staff was very friendly and the food was made super fast. The menu is so extensive that I can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"Wish i lived closer so i could go back. Great customer service, amazing food, and fast service. Not to mention their huge selection of pancakes and waffles! 1 pancake is bigger than my head and only 2.95$ Great breakfast and lunch selections for a great price!"}
{"text":"Red velvet pancake was bomb. Me and my boyfriend were sold on the meat lover skillet special, so we shared that and the pancake. He also had the steak tips which was absolutely amazing! My server Chris was also very nice and the rest of the staff was great, well be back again, it's great because we live only 10 minutes away which is nice."}
{"text":"Love this place! There pancakes blow baby stacks out of the water. Potatoes are amazing!! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time here and I have lived across the street for two years. Wish I had visited sooner. Very good food. Service was excellent and friendly. Not only your server will ask if everything is OK. The servers look after all the tables together to be sure you are not wanting for anything. The good was excellent and presented well. My wife and I will be back for sure. Going again today with a friend who loves breakfast any time during the day, so we will see if this first review holds up with our second visit."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service!  My boyfriend and I left there stuffed and happy. If you're looking for a good breakfast/lunch spot this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Ordered the turkey gobble.... Delicious. It has turkey sausage potatoes cheese spinach red bell pepper and egg. Great little atmosphere. Friendly environment. Will be back"}
{"text":"Seating was quick, food was out fast after ordering. Taste was good but not extraordinary. I would go there again and try some other items. Price was more than fair and wait staff was responsive to our needs."}
{"text":"I thought the food and service was excellent. The food came out relatively quick for how busy it was. The only constructive criticism I have is the waiting area. I felt like I was on top of the guests eating. Maybe an overhang outside or something for waiting. Also a sign saying please wait to be seated would help direction. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, because I love supporting local. However, I just didn't. First of all, the atmosphere is uncomfortable. There are a bunch of young kids working there that are really doing nothing. They kind of just wander around staring at everyone. It's not pleasant. It's not their fault they have nothing to do, but the owner should cut labor and save himself a little money. 
Secondly, the food was not seasoned at all. I am not sure why but our home fries had no salt at all and were only partially cooked. 
Lastly, over 30 dollars for two people to eat breakfast is pretty steep. I wouldn't have a problem with it if it was good, but it just wasn't."}
{"text":"For that reason it has 3.5 stars and very bad attitude of the server. I ordered the food well cooked and they brought me all raw very bad experience and I wasted my time and could not eat breakfast because if it did not arrive late to my job. horrible."}
{"text":"I frequent this place weekly. I would say about 3 or 4 times a week. The food here is amazing. It almost feels like your at home and your mom is a super creative and good cook. The owner is very personable. The prices are very fair. The food is absolutely delicious. 

I have celiac disease and this is one of the very few breakfast spots that has a gluten free menu! Their gluten free waffles and pancakes are absolutely amazing! 


5 stars and two thumbs up for this place!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this colorful place a try. So glad we did.
Immediately greeted and seated.It was cozy, colorful and very clean. 
My omelet was HUGE and chuck full of vegetables. Piping hot and fresh.
 Husband had a turkey club and said it was very good. Very reasonable prices. Will definitely make this our number one breakfast place."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast spot in the Southwest part of Las Vegas. This place can get busy depending on the time of day but I see it being very busy that hour just after breakfast and just before lunch.  

I had to try one of their skillets on this visit.  I was torn between the \"Great Gobbler\" and the \"Philly\".  Both ingredient combinations looked appetizing as did the others.  I decided on the \"Philly\" with thin steak grilled peppers and onions with provolone cheese melted over a king size bed of thick cut american fries and topped with 3 eggs over easy.  Wow! the portions are huge.  I couldn't believe they were topping these skillets with 3 eggs  while most places give 2. The iron skillet came out sizzling hot like the sound of fajitas at a Mexican joint.  Also the huge amount of potatoes underneath all the toppings will definitely be a challenge to finish.  I think they should cut the potatoes a little smaller to cook a little more evenly and crunchier but they were still awesome.  This was an excellent dish.  My friend chose the \"Gobbler and he said it was delicious and filling as well.  Another in the group had the traditional eggs benedict and that was also demolished.  

Overall visit was good, food was made with quality ingredients and the portions were very filling and prices reasonable.  I cannot wait to go back however this location is pretty far from my home and will have to be a destination location.  Stacks and Yolks does have a location closer to me in the north on Jones Blvd so I might have to do a comparison between the two.  This restaurants claim to fame is its pancakes claiming over 10 different batters.  So if you like to start your day with sweets you might fancy this concept.  I enjoy more of a savory dish to start my day which are also very good here.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to eat was recommended stacks and yolks we came here we got seated right away pleasant service fast the food was awesome five star"}
{"text":"I will never go to this restaurant again!!! It's disgusting! I wouldn't even touch the water. The fact that my six year old daughter had hair in her happy face pancakes made me want to throw up! We sent it back and the waiter apologized. Come time to checkout I was  charged full price for the meal because they made her a new one! What the heck, that's what you were suppose to do! Was she suppose to eat around the hair. Never again!! Not to mention we were there celebrating my sister's b-day!! The fact that I was force to give this place one star just to post this review is horrible."}
{"text":"The start was a good start.  My boyfriend and I were immediately greeted by the host and seated at a table.  Shortly after, the busser asked us what we would like to drink and promptly gave us our drinks.  Waitress asked to take our orders right after.

Then it goes downhill...Once our orders are in, we are waiting 25-35 minutes for our food.  The busser/waitress checked on us and our drinks once during the time.  FInally our food arrives.  I got the corned beef hash, everything is burnt, it was mediocre at best, my over-easy eggs were under cooked  (I did not complain or send it back.) My boyfriend got the western skillet,  he liked it, but the entire bottom portions of food were burnt...yes, it is a skillet; however, there are proper ways to prepare skillet meals, where the bottom does not end up burnt.  No one checked on us the entire time we were eating.  Our drinks were completely empty our entire meal.  My boyfriend saw the busser pass behind me, stare directly at my empty glass, and went about her business, without checking on us.  When our bill came, my boyfriend told the person we needed our drinks refilled and that no one checked on us the entire time we ate...The busser overheard this and gave my boyfriend the evil eye...The ice tea was out now, the ice machine wasn't working.  No refill for me, my boyfriend got the water he requested.  This place is a mess.

It was a fairly busy day.  However, they had two hosts, plenty of bussers, waiters/waitresses, and kitchen staff.  It should not take that long for breakfast food to come out.  Food was mediocre, service was horrible.  Bill was $34 (not including tip) for two people, which would have been okay, if the food was excellent and the service was good.  The alignment of the tables made it difficult to walk out, and all I wanted to do was run out of this place fast!  Will never come back to this place.

One star, because even if the start was ok, how dare an employee give an evil eye or glare to a customer."}
{"text":"Went to Stacks and Yolks for the first time today, everyone talks about how great the food is....well for starters, I ordered a cup of coffee, the cup had lipstick all over it. I also asked for water, the water didn't come until I was almost done with my food. The silverware was dirty. 

Once the food came, the two skillets didn't have the avocado on it like it was ordered, the skillets were cold. The meat scrambler that I ordered with a biscuit and gravy came out cold, and the home fries was a toss up on if they were cooked or not. Considering I spent 50.00 on food, I would have expected the quality of the food to be better than it was. 

The food servers (not sure who was ours since so many came over and checked on us) were great!!! The best part was the customer service. The food was not good and I felt like it was just thrown on the plate and served cold. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Could be a little cleaner - our table was sticky when we sat down.

I really like this menu - lots of options and you can mix and match as you please.  I didn't even know you could get flavored pancake batter.  I got french toast and scrambled eggs and both were really good.  Big portion of french toast with plenty of cinnamon and syrup.

Everything was served quickly too.

Went for lunch on a weekday and the place was pretty empty."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff. Fast efficient service. It was around 11 am when visiting. Peak breakfast time, each person that entered was greeted by staff. The food was hot & fresh. I'll def be back."}
{"text":"This place was delicious, ambiance is cafe like, and service is great. We ordered corn beef hash, kids pancakes, and the egg scramble. All delicious and I think our bill was under $30. Quick tip: rather than get the kids pancake, just order a single stack. There is a variety of options and perfectly sized to feed a three year old boy!"}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing. Amazing service , amazing food , amazing vibe. The staff had a sense of urgency, there weren't stations assigned to certain servers se everyone helped each other out and the service shined through, it was awesome to come to this place .... 

That all faded away. Staff is slow , doesn't seem to care or like working there. Each server is assigned a section , no sense of urgency except for one guy in the back that's workin his ass off. 

Food is good but not worth the dead atmosphere. Few hardworking staff seems to carry the rest. Management/ Owners! Step in and change something, make it so your staff is happy to be there and you guests will be happy to be there .

Also bathrooms are kind of nasty... I wish they were cleaner ..."}
{"text":"I cannot believe it took me so long to write this review. We have been going here for a LONG time! first of all I am not a big breakfast person and this place WOW's us every time. The quality of food is great, the service is always on top of it, they are always busy even on weekday mornings but can handle the volume! They will even let you do call a head seating with is nice if you are kind of in a time crunch or whatever. The owner gets to know you from the first time we visited, they make you feel like family from your first visit. The only improvement that could be made would be to expand the location to accommodate more people because there are so many who LOVE this little spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast ... found it randomly on yelp and tried it out ... staff was great and menu has something for everyone."}
{"text":"Great customer service, but food is garbage. I got red velvets and whoever said this is the best lied! They taste plain with this sour tasting raspberry sauce on top along with sour strawberries. Also, my mom ordered bacon but I kid you not it is not bacon, it looks like a sausage with a bunch of fat on it."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and I had a skillet. I was pretty good but too many potatoes. I'd love to come back and try some different stuff though!"}
{"text":"Pro's:  Servers are polite

Cons:  LONG WAIT FOR THE FOOD!!  Got the Chicken Fried Steak and it's a FROZEN patty!!  Gravy may be a mix of some sort and the potatoes came out luke warm.  I asked for soft scrambled eggs and they came out double cooked!  My friend got one of the skillets and the cheese wasn't even melted!

Don't recommend.  Sheesh."}
{"text":"Checking this place out for the first time. Friendly atmosphere and friendly waiter. Eggs undercooked and the home fries are bland and under seasoned. Otherwise an ok place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning. We had been trying to get there for the longest time because the place looked so cute and I love eggs. The first problem was that all of the food came to us cold. Next, the \"should have been scrambled\" eggs came to me over easy. The pancakes were not what I expected and personally did not like them. Then the other eggs that were cold took more than 10 minutes to come back but this time they came scrambled with cheese on top. We were very disappointed to say these least. Then when we got the bill, the amounts were wrong and no bill adjustment whatsoever for all of the numerous problems with the meal."}
{"text":"We stopped in yesterday after just having a pancake craving and this place was great for that. We ordered original pancakes and forever November and some coffee! Mickey took our order and served us, he was very pleasant! FYI...neither of the 3 of us could even finish 1 pancake! Will definitely be going back there when I visit Las Vegas again!"}
{"text":"peanut butter and chocolate chip pancakes... DELICIOUS!  Also love their corn beef hash."}
{"text":"Might as well ordered from a mess tent.  Potatoes burnt. Bacon floppy. Toast soaked in fake butter.  Coffee watered down. Left a tip. I want it back. What a joke. Came to get food since we were eating crappy hospital food in the maternity ward.  Sad to say this food is about the same.  Very disappointed. Just found out I ordered eggs over medium.   Sadly they are over hard.  In the garbage it goes. I'm still hungry!!!  I just threw away a whole meal.  My girl just opened her food. Same deal.  Ordered the same thing. Got the same crap. $25 in the garbage."}
{"text":"This place was really good and am glad I came here. I had a chorizo scrambler and a peanut butter pancake with whipped cream. Totally stuffed myself! My wife had an omelette that she liked as well. The fresh squeezed orange juice is awesome.

Advice is to arrive early because it does get busy."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch here today at the griddle. It is very close to my house and the yelp reviews were good so I said why not ? We were seated right away, although it seemed busy. We were asked a beverage choice and we gave the order. The young lady returned with one drink and scrunched up her face and asked again for the other two. I'm really picky so I would say to most that wouldn't be a big idea. For me I'm thinking\"pen and paper maybe?\" Or at least don't make us feel guilty because you forgot . Moving on the server had a really good special description and if my mind wasn't already made up I would've jumped on one.

The food was really good. I had a tuna wrap(I know) my gf had the wheat pancakes(so damn good) and my partner had the country breakfast. We all loved the food and will definitely be back. Might write my drink order down though...:-)....I kid I kid... The griddle is dope and a sure fire hit for breakfast or lunch...

Deuces,
Ish"}
{"text":"Wow what a resteraunt.  The decor and building leaves a lot to be desired, but it is clean. Then there is the food.  Portions are huge and ingredients are fresh.  I had a Philly skillet and the mushrooms were fresh & sauteed. Their home fries in the skillet had a great slight crisp to the outside. Our server Carlos was so good also. Amazing is one word to describe.  Will most definately be back again"}
{"text":"Horrible service and extremely overpriced breakfast. They also had horrible food and safety rating for weeks. I left disgusted again and I won't be back unless things change."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! Bomb.com!!!!!!!! Pancakes, French Toast, Skillet, coffee, everything is freshly made here. Thats what it taste like. I wouldn't mind sitting on a hard chair if they had one, the butt pain would be worth it!"}
{"text":"This Stacks and Yolks took over what used to be Molly's Kountry Kafe.  Although the family that owns the place is the same, I feel that the love went out the door when the kids took over the joint.  Having never been a fan of Stacks and Yolks, I was tempted to try them once more after hearing about their churro waffles.

Where do I begin? I went on a Saturday, after the morning rush.  There was no wait to be seated.  Someone took my drink order right away and provided us with menus.  We got our coffee and the server said she would return to take our order.  We waited approximately 20 minutes to place our order.  Long enough to finish my first cup of coffee and get a refill.  I decided against the churro waffle and opted to try a belgian waffle combo.  I wanted to make sure their basics were up to standard before spending $16+ on a breakfast meal ya know? I ordered scrambled eggs and bacon (extra crispy) with my waffle. The eggs were overcooked and dry.  The bacon was not crispy at all.  I'm not sure if this was because my order was not written down or if the kitchen staff made a mistake.  I could have looked the other way had my waffle been great but it was far from it.  The waffle was dry as cardboard and was missing something...vanilla, oil, something to make it light and crispy the way a Belgian waffle should be.  My suggestion: dust off the old Molly's recipes and bring back that waffle.  Those waffles were life!

Additionally, mediocre food can be ok when it is served with excellent service.  I felt that the servers were disorganized or didn't know whose table was whose because they all walked by our table several times and no one checked on us.  At one point, I debated calling the restaurant to ask for a refill on my coffee.  I eventually asked the young man when he brought out our check.

Imagine my surprise when the person checking me out was the previous Molly's owner.  She was pleasant and apologetic.  She comped one of our meals and we reminisced about old times.  The younger generation needs to take a few pages from her book and learn about customer service."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!! The location is filthy! The tables and chairs are sticky. The bathroom looks like a gas station bathroom. Service was ok, Food was ok and took over 25 minutes to come out and there weren't many people there. We ordered omelets. My moms looked like it was overlooked, the potatoes were burnt but cold and very bland.  The toast had so much butter it actually pooled up on my plate. Where I was sitting I could see the cooks continually putting stuff in a microwave. Really??? I'll go to the SW location."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!!

Came to stacks and yolks for a late lunch after hearing good things about them.  I had the California eggs Benedict with home potatoes on the side.  Man was this freaking delicious!  The spinach and tomatoes on the Benedict was perfectly cooked, the eggs impeccably poached.  The home potatoes had the perfect crisp.  My husband said the pancakes were awesome and maybe better than hash house?  
Not only was the food bomb, but the service was super courteous and super fast, which is a HUGE plus to my 8 months pregnant self!  
We will definitely be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Perfect local breakfast/brunch spot. Biscuits & gravy are a must! 5 stars for service and great food."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. Yes in the RV Pancakes. I like the options of building pancakes I three easy steps.  And yes they have Free Wifi."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing breakfast, staff is amazingly friendly and sweet. Jessie is an absolute doll and provided stellar service. We will definitely be back again for more amazing food. The skillets are top notch."}
{"text":"I grew up in Huntington Beach, where local spots for breakfast are a big deal. It took me 10 years to find a breakfast spot with that home town feel, and food you can count on!! Now that I've found it, this is an every Monday AM spot with friends. The owner greets you with a smile, and that welcome  feeling you only get from a \"locals\" spot. He knows us when we walk in, as does the staff. Nothing beats that feeling of being comfortable and at home. 

The food and coffee are spot on, and the OJ is killer. The girl who put down the gluten free stuff, needs to check herself. They have two kinds, one of which is Paleo friendly, which a big deal to a Paleo girl like myself. The almond meal batter allows me to savor a pancake, without risking major back lash from my body for eating a rice flour version of GF. I look forward to my Paleo pancake every single week! My friends who is GF prefers the other type, which they happily make for her. The griddle platter or the Portuguese (linguisa) sausage and eggs are what I get on the regular with my epic pancake. The syrup is hot, the coffee is smooth, they actually have tapatio for my eggs, and the food is something we all crave in our group that show up every single Monday. The owners truly care about the place, and it is clean every time I've been there. I honestly have nothing bad to say about Stacks & Yolks. 

If you haven't tried this place, you're missing out. I bring everyone here for a perfect breakfast, every single time. My clients even cruise over for breakfast after their weekend riding lessons!! 

See you Monday morning!"}
{"text":"Great Service! Food is okay but service made it worth it. Would come back. Next time will try their pancakes."}
{"text":"Was just here with my family, dissatisfied, because first off the bathroom was disgusting. Not to mention, the wait-staff was terrible, our server \"Brandon\" insulted me by asking if I had \"even bothered to read the menu?\", never came to check on us, and when he did it was because we called him over after my wife and daughter had to stop eating because their \"ground beef\" was literally just big chunks of chopped up unseasoned hamburger. After finally just wanting to pay and leave, I asked a curly haired bus boy to take my check up to the counter to which he snatched the check, rolled his eyes, and slung it on the counter. As he walked away with a scowl on his face I realized you could see the young mans underwear. Seriously ? I've never experienced such disrespectful service from this place, and honestly would probably never visit again."}
{"text":"Service is great!!! Our server Dani was so funny and made me a special plate since im a vegetarian!! Recommend it 100% great environment to enjoy a meal"}
{"text":"Stacks and Yolks is pretty much my favorite breakfast spot in Las Vegas.  They're busy to arrive early if you need them to set up if you are bringing friends, and don't always expect to be seated right away.  I've noticed that they tend to get busy on the hour every hour.  I might recommend that you get there at 9:45 am instead of at 10 am, if you want an easier time sitting.

The day we went, we have a party of ten, but came a few minutes before ten, and were promptly seated.  Seating itself is pretty tight.  My party are all fairly fit people, who were easy to squeeze into small places, but I would think a larger person might find this setting uncomfortable.  A lot of people apparently agree this place is amazing, so they are always trying to get in and eat.  The servers are prompt and attentive, and I always have a pleasant time without needing to wait to long to order anything.

The food is heaven.  Some of my favorites are the pancakes -- I recommend the Pumpkin Pancakes.  While I have a sweet tooth for breakfast, they have great omelets, thick cut bacon, and sandwiches to satisfy a diverse palate.  I've never had a bad menu item, and my friends and families always leave happy and full."}
{"text":"Bacon from heaven?! More like pork belly from HELL. Worst protein pancake ever. Even the scrambled eggs were bad. Probably because they tasted like they were half cooked in the pork belly grease. 

I love breakfast, but this was not breakfast. Also it was kinda weird that all of the waiters were men. 

At least they had free Wi-Fi that I had to haggle the password for. It's \"pancakes\" by the way...

Good luck, but just avoid this place."}
{"text":"The foods okay, it is a tight fit in there, the place is a little small

but what really turned me off about this place was seeing the owner touching a customers pancakes after greeting customers which means, shaking hands..he even admitted to it and no he didn't wash his hands I watched him, that wasn't the first time i saw someone handling food in the kitchen without gloves. its just very unsanitary."}
{"text":"I got a take out order from them on Saturday morning right as the opened, I have been training for the past 3 months for a fitness competition, once I competed for some reason all I was craving was Belgian waffles!  My waffle was the biggest disappointment ever.  It was rubbery, and had no fluff to it, it actually seemed like they just took pancake mix and attempted to make a waffle out of it.  It wasn't crispy at all, and not because it was in a take out container, we live maybe 2mins from the establishment, it was never crispy to begin with.  On top of it just being poor in taste and texture it looked horrible, burnt edges and they didn't even bother to clean off the over spill edges which is that parts that were burnt. 

It tasted like they hadn't cleaned the waffle iron in some time.  There was s distinct taste of charred waffles that had been their before.  This was my first experience here and my absolute last."}
{"text":"The minute you walk in you are greeted with a sense of coziness and art. The waiting area has one bench which puts you very close to those around you. (Not always good if you don't like being close to people, however, if you suck it up for about 5 minutes, a server will have a table cleaned and ready). The walls are covered with multicolored wood which adds to the decor.  

The server greets you immediately with a smile and a wait time. You are asked a couple of times if you have been helped. Sitting back and watching, it was a clockwork of teams helping, cleaning, cooking, serving.  It was fascinating watching the cafe come alive.

The food took awhile to get, after all it is a Sunday morning and a classic car show is taking place next door.  When it comes, it is warm and tasty.  Not a moment went by when my cup was dry, coffee was always on hand.

Is the food the best I've ever had, it's fine, not the best. It's not the worst, it's good. It is darn good.  The service, the people, and the flavor is definitely worth the 5 stars.  Look into this place, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The custom omelette my wife got with bacon, avocado, mushrooms, and greenpeppers was good. As were the home fries it came with. My lemon blueberry pancakes, on the other hand, were too dense and thick. It was almost like trying to eat a wet dish rag. It was one of the most unpleasant things I've eaten in a while. The orange juice wasn't my favorite either. It tasted similar to frozen concentrate that was too watery. On the plus side of the dining experience was the friendly service. The two servers were busily rushing from table to table but always seemed to have a minute to chat."}
{"text":"Shame on you Stacks & Yolks.  While this is about the 4th time eating at this location I will not be back.  Listen, I am not putting blame on the little girl who moved us I am putting it on the person in charge that made her do it.  You saw us when we walked up, my 75 year old father struggling with me holding him to just walk, you saw how long it took us to get into the restaurant, you seated us and you watched as I had to put him in his chair, take off his jaket and pull him in close to the table.  You watched us order coffee, we sat there for a good 10 minutes long enough to get OJ and Water, and order food.  15 minuets we sat there and then you come and tell us we have to move because you have to get ready for a 12 top.  Get out of here.  I refused and said no.....you gave me no option, my mother who hates arguments just said move, Shame on you.  Now I have to move my 75 year old feeble father with Parkinsons disease.  Not easy, had to move the table then grab him and stand him up while the rest of the people stare.  It's hard enough on him then to have to embarrass him like that.    I won't be back to your establishment, this was just ridiculous and un needed.  I am ashamed of you.  You should all be ashamed of yourself."}
{"text":"I only go in when I need a oil change from across the street . Way over priced n very bland . McDonald's McMuffin is allot better. Urghh how does the place stay in  business. Rap music at 8a.m. on the weekend we ride motorcycles and our favorite thing to do in the morning is to hit up breakfast spots I will stay clear of that place they have lost my business!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner there and I have to say I was totally disappointed! I ordered the chicken fried steak with biscuits and gravy. The gravy was out of a package and the biscuits were hard as a rock! The chicken fried steak was frozen. I could of made it better myself for way less money. I was really hoping for an amazing meal. I mean they are a breakfast restaurant how can they use frozen chicken fried steak and hard biscuits that weren't even homemade. $12 for that. I really am super disappointed. I don't like leaving bad reviews because everyone can have an off day or night as the case may be but wow it was honestly that bad. I only selected one star because I had to.  Please fix this stacks and yolks!!"}
{"text":"The manager seems to make efforts to be friendly and make you welcome. Food is pretty good. My local for Breakfast on weekends."}
{"text":"The lemon blueberry pancakes were pretty good. The food in general was good. The place gets packed every weekend, there was a wait when we got there. But we had to pack our food up right when it came to the table and leave. There were quite a few flies around the front area. Very bothersome, kept getting at our food. None of the staff said anything about it or even tried to acknowledge the fact that they were there.  I would have given more stars but it was very irritating to try to keep them away from our food."}
{"text":"Not a fan, never will be.  I've driven by this place so many times, so this morning we took the time to stop in for breakfast.  No line formed yet, so we were quickly seated.  I believe that a good cup of coffee is essential for diners, right?  Not so with us.  The coffee was so weak it could have passed as tea.  Our yoke-less veggie omelet was just so-so.  It was more like scrambled eggs with veggies.  We enjoyed the short stack but have had better elsewhere.  And the scrambled eggs were runny with our sausage patties.  To top it all off - within an hour of leaving we both got upset stomachs."}
{"text":"ZERO stars. Most of the negative reviews are extremely accurate - dirty silverware, dirty floors, slow service...I can't even speak to the food because it simply didn't ever make it to the table. No follow up from the server on the delay, so I walked out. This is mid-week and only two other people dining here. First and last visit. Can't imagine how a business can operate in subpar conditions...."}
{"text":"I love this place,  we found it about a month ago and have been here 6 times already.   The food is super yummy!  The s'mores pancake is mouth drooling good!  Country combo is great!  Breakfast burrito yummers. The ceaser wrap was delish. We have brought our family and friends here to and it's always a high five!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we decided to try it on a Thursday morning. Hubby was greeted rather rudely by a gentleman when he walked in the door, telling him to go outside and someone will come and take our name. There was a podium outside and no one was at it so that was why he walked in. After a couple of minutes a young lady came and took our name and said it would be about 15/20minutes. No problem as they serve breakfast all Day and it was almost noontime. It was busy but looked to be ok. Once we were seated inside, guess who our server was? \"Rude\" Guy. Lucky us, the young lady brought us coffee and water and I asked her for utensils, she brought us forks and knives,no napkins or spoons. Asked another server for napkins and spoons. Now there were a few empty tables at this time. Lots of choices so I had a few questions. Seemed that our server was annoyed with something as I told him it was our first time and I had a few questions. He half heartily apologized saying they were short handed so just didn't even really answer my questions but told me that pancakes are large and the most popular are on the wall and that he would come back to take our order. Before even taking our food order, we already had three cups of coffee. Next had a little clipboard with a bill and a credit card attached dropped off for us and same \"rude\" guy said without even looking at us, \"have a nice day\". REALLY! Stopped another young man and gave him the bill and credit card and told him in a joking manner, that we would like to have our meal before getting a bill for it. He laughed and apologized. Meal finally came and it was ok. Large portions for sure and price was reasonable for the quality and quantity. First point of contact sets the tone for the experience. After driving clear across town to eat here, I would be hard pressed to recommend. I can get the same thing closer to home minus the \"Rude\" guy."}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal and the employees were nice. I like the wood planks that are on the walls. It gives the place a nice country feeling. 

I ordered the steak tips and the Elvis pancakes. Both were well prepared. The Elvis cakes are prepared with peanut butter batter and are filled with bacon and some other pork product that makes a man smile. Then they cover them with bananas and powered sugar.

My Lil one got the churro waffles .... let's just stop right there for a minute and let that soak in. CHURRO freaking waffles folks....with a tub of cream cheese to dress them with. All you Disneyland churro freaks have to try this. You absolutely have to try them."}
{"text":"Wow. Terrible experience this time!  I know this is the desert, but not looking to try and chocke down one of the world's driest pancakes. 1/2 way through, ran out of the tiny amount of syrup they brought...and never did get more coffee or asked how everything was...

Very disappointed. However,  'slice of bacon from heaven' was truly from heaven. So thank you for that."}
{"text":"What can I say about S&Y but starve yourself before coming in. The portions are not only gigantic, but mouthwatering. Baha (owner) is undeniably very welcoming and caters to each of his customer's every need. Makes custom pancake on the spot! Food tastes amazing and super cozy, trendy atmosphere. One of my go to spots!"}
{"text":"So I'm eating healthy and order my omelette with turkey sausage, they are out so I ask for chicken sausage. She comes back to table and says it's going to be a $5 upcharge, I'm like really? You are out of what I ordered and they wouldn't budge. I also order my food with no toast or home fries and they bring my food with home fries anyways, to tempt me or what?!?"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. First time I had a skillet breakfast and it was really good - not excessively salty like so many restaurant potato dishes. Next time I had to try their flavored pancakes. I picked the lemon flavor - oh yummy! 
In general I'd say this place is pretty good. It gets busy at peak times and I think the staff sometimes gets a little overwhelmed. Everyone there is very friendly, though, and usually quite attentive. Also, the prices good and the place is clean. Stacks and Yolks is among my top 5 breakfast places."}
{"text":"Well, this is why i give a place multiple chances before i review. Generally, I've come here and am blown away by the portions and the food is satisfactory. However I stumbled here on an oddly busy Tuesday and after being seated and waiting for my order to be processed for over 20 minutes, we never received water until after our food arrived. It was a nice day, but we were sitting outside in Vegas. Water should be the first thing in our hands... upon receiving my water we noticed a blue item attached to our ice. I didn't bother to get it fixed since being parched was what i was dealing with anyways. I may sound harsh but this is still a decent breakfast spot. I just have expectations for basics and that is why i give this place 3 stars."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant.. Small and crowded, but that was fine. The food was just ok though. For them being partly known for pancakes, they weren't very good. They were very rubbery, chewy and couldn't cut through them with a fork. I wasn't a fan of the consistency at all. You shouldn't have to use a knife on pancakes.I tried others at the table to see if it was just my batter or not (cinnamon pancake batter). They were all of that consistency and chewiness. The pumpkin ones didn't really taste too much like pumpkin, very faint. My scramble had home fries on the bottom and the larger potatoes were hard :( When we were finished, no plates were cleared. We sat for 15 min talking and paying bill with old food in front of us. I've had much better food at Sunrise Cafe, Rise and Shine, or Babystacks. Not sure I'll be back.."}
{"text":"The bean and ham soup was terrible, my chicken pesto sand had no cheese, and the chicken tasted like jerky! What happened to them???  Used to be great!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot. I am having the Arizona which is quite tasty (a little spicy). I am still waiting for my English muffin and I am almost finished...three and a half stars would be more accurate."}
{"text":"I'd say one of the top spots to go eat breakfast or lunch with family or just for a date. The portions for he price you pay are exceptional. The enviroment is very chill not loud, but it does have the sound of people being energized for their day due to the delicious satisfying food. Loved how the decor was layed out very colorful and simple. The employees do an awesome job and are so friendly. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This is our third time here since they changed management. I fall more and more in love with this place! The food is delicious... The pancakes are TO DIE FOR!! The \"Always November\" stacks are ridiculously amazing! We've even made a friend there! Her name is Taylor and she has had us laughing through our last two visits! Maybe you'll be lucky enough to be in her section!"}
{"text":"Staff friendly, atmosphere clean, prices fair... and the pancakes were DELICIOUS!! My boyfriend said some of the best pancakes he'd ever had (for reference he ordered the buttermilk short stack with strawberries and whip cream). Pancake portions are HUGE so make sure to go hungry!"}
{"text":"Good food and I love that u can just order just 1 piece of French toast. Prepare to wait it's a small place which produces a wait."}
{"text":"Every time we come here, we leave happy and full. The portion sizes are perfect and the menu has such a great variety to chose from. The kids menu is priced just right as well as the portion size is perfect for kids. So happy we found this little gem!"}
{"text":"Over crowded over hyped.. both me n my bf ate here and the food was not as good as we had hoped.. the potatoes were under cooked.. and the waitress never brought half of my bf meal.. all in all I say it was a waste of money"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! Best breakfast I have EVER had. Our server Brandon was super sweet, knowledgeable, and gave us wonderful suggestions. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Decent food - horrible service - been there 4 times - this first time was good but the last two times the service has been bad.  Can't get a coffee refill , the credit card machine broke and towards the end of the meal they put a cash only sign on door.  The waiters are not organized at all - patrons kept having to ask for refills , checks etc 
Won't go there again"}
{"text":"STACKS on STACKS on STACKS

So me and the best friend like to eat breakfast, I however do not wake up in time. We usually grab something from a place about to close but on this day I was up before noon. So we ventured to a new and exciting place down the street from my place. Stacks and Yolks is in the northeast corner of Warm Springs and Durango. They have a hostess stand outside and you have to wait to be seated and I understand why. It's so cramped inside. The table we sat at was right by the register so everyone was walking by and standing near us. They servers even had to sneak behind each other. We sat and looked through the menu and I was all about the pancakes. I order a single stack of red velvet and a single of lemon blueberry. I thought, \"Oh, a single stack is small.\" Just kidding. They are the size of the plate. I only ate half of both. They were both delicious but i preferred the lemon blueberry. The red velvet has some sauces on it that weren't the bomb. Otherwise they come with a huge scoop of better and they didn't need much syrup. Overall a good first experience. I want to go back and try some of the Yolks."}
{"text":"Gave us drinks without straws. Had to ask twice and then they still shorted us by one. Had to ask a third time. Dirty silverware. Bathroom is a mess with black sticky floors and paper towels everywhere. Women's rest room had a broken lock and no paper towels. Arnold Palmer had virtually no lemonade. My daughter pinched all of her fingers in her chair trying to scoot back. The chair is falling apart and unsafe. The table is being balanced by two different magazines in two different spots.
Now the food: it was all pretty good. A couple half-pound chunks of potato were still raw but it was good. I ordered a ham skillet and got a treat with a piece of random sausage. The hot sauce needs some attention though. The wood cap on the Chalula bottle was split and actually came off. The label was written and faded as though it were five years old. Yet the bottle was full of hot sauce. Isn't it illegal to refill manufacturer's condiment bottles?"}
{"text":"Can't remember what the previous name of the restaurant was but it's still good as ever. Went there on a Sunday morning and it was jam-packed. Somehow we got a seat without waiting, which was nice! However if you have a party greater than 2 then I would expect to wait for seats. The menu seems roughly the same as before, with a bunch of customizable pancakes, waffles and egg scrambles available. I had the Chorizo scramble and the french waffles with buffalo wings. The interior is new and doesn't have that 'grandma' feel like in some breakfast restaurants.

It took a good 30 minutes for the food to come out but it was a full house. Fortunately the wait was well worth it. The portions are pretty big and we ordered just enough to feed two people. The price is more than fair at around $10 bucks a plate. Service is excellent and friendly.

I think this is a solid choice for breakfast or lunch. I recommend the red relvet pancakes or the french waffles with buffalo wings. Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Stacks and Yolks has amazing skillet breakfasts. Way better than what I've had at other breakfast establishments. I love the potatoes because they look and taste like actual potatoes instead of those unnatural fried squares. I have yet to try most of the \"stacks\" batters but the lemon blueberry is good. The biscuits and gravy are great, too! The employees are always friendly."}
{"text":"The cook doesn't know how to make poached eggs, over medium, or anything but scrambled."}
{"text":"Went here with a party of 9, surprisingly they got us in pretty fast. I ordered the California Eggs Benedict which is suppose to come with avocado, but i never received avocado with my breakfast. After waiting forever to get the waitresses attention she then decides to tell us they have run out. I would have like to have been informed before i ordered so i could have changed my order. The freshly squeezed orange juice is good. Didn't have a good first experience."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot.  Service is prompt and the food is delicious.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ordering pancakes here, as that is their specialty.  Their omelettes are amazing as well.  Give the birthday cake or snores pancakes a try!"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast and the portions omg huge , and really good service I recommend this place. Can't wait to go back and try something new"}
{"text":"Found a new gem in the Southwest part of Vegas. It's a breakfast/brunch/lunch spot that happened to be on my way home from the gym. I'm glad boyfriend and I decided to stop in and give it a try. When we went, it was closer to closing and there were not many people in there. The food arrived very quickly after we ordered and the staff was very attentive. 

Here's what we tried: 

Goblet skillet - Turkey Sausage, Spinach, Roasted Red Pepper over Home Fries with Cheese. Not the deep fried kind, but the delicious kind fried atop a commercial flat-top stove. The skillet came with a side of your choice of 1 biscuit and gravy or toast. Of course, I went with the biscuit and gravy. The skillet came in a hearty portion that I was unable to finish. 

Griddle platter - Chicken, Spinach, Mushroom and Feta Cheese over Home Fries with 3 Eggs any style. Served with Pita Bread. This was also a scrumptious meal served in a large portion. Just the right amount of feta cheese rounded out the flavors. I liked the goblet skillet way better. 

Now, it took me a long time to figure out what I wanted because everything on the menu looked so good. Next time, I'm going to try the marinated steak tips because, as the menu says, it is \"marinated 18 hrs in Unicorn tears, served with 3 Eggs, Home Fries, Biscuit & Gravy.\" UNICORN TEARS. 

Sold."}
{"text":"Always so happy eating here!  Pancakes are phenomenal! Super friendly service which I love!  Thank you Baja you're awesome!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and the staff is awesome. ..we went on Mothers Day  long wait but so worth it.  We were a party of nine so the variety of food was nice. I had Always November and it was amazing and my sis said it was the BEST french toast she had ever eaten."}
{"text":"A good place to stop in for a meal if you are in the area. We went at 10:30am on a Sunday with a 10 minute wait. The service was quick and friendly. Food came out exactly as ordered. Prices were right on target and the food was served in huge portions so be prepared to share or get a to go box. My only gripe was that there were a LOT of tables in that tiny little place. It felt very cramped and I bet it was hard for the servers to do their job without bumping into someone else. Not much privacy or move to room during your meal. There are tables outside if you want to brave the heat, cold, or car exhaust."}
{"text":"I like coming here for breakfast on weekend mornings because there is a sense of comfort. We come here so often that the hubby and I are almost 'regulars'. 
Now don't expect a fancy place. This place could use some major TLC. 
The staff work their butts off to deliver the food in a quick manner. We order basically the same meal each time which comes out consistent in flavor. This location can get packed, but people seem to be in and out without too much rush or wait. For the two of us the bill is usually around 25$."}
{"text":"My roommate and I were eating here every Sunday for a while. We haven't gone lately just because of schedules, but for the most part it's a solid place. Our first experience was great! Super friendly staff and really tasty food. I wish I could say every dish was spot on, but we've hit a few bumps in the road. While the pancakes, which come in myriad flavors, and the waffle have always been outstanding for me, my boyfriend got the chicken fried steak one day for lunch and it was less than stellar. The skillets are also pretty tasty and come in good portions. They charge $1.99 EACH for whipped cream and strawberries which is kind of ridiculous. We ordered them both for our red velvet pancakes without realizing just how pricey it really was. That was a bit of a disappointment. They know how to do pancakes though. I've had the red velvet, orange cranberry, and buckwheat and they've all been quite tasty. Someone in another review said they were dry; I disagree.  Baja, the owner, is really friendly and does a great job providing wonderful customer service. I haven't been for lunch, but I've heard the burgers are delish."}
{"text":"WOW. Way overpriced for what they serve you. Tasteless Corned Beef Hash & Eggs for $14.99. If you love coffee, don't order it. Very weak. To the owners. Please if you you are going to charge a ridiculous price for anything, at least give them their money's worth. Don't think I will have a planned return."}
{"text":"Chicken & waffles are ok. Benedict with Turkey sausage alright. Potatoes, RAW Service, Not There! Only the coffee is Good and at least the utensils are clean! Atmosphere, smells Old. Not planning of returning!"}
{"text":"I have a cardinal rule that I eat by: if the floor is dirty, the food is bad.  Walk away.

I should've followed my cardinal rule that day, but decided to give this place the benefit of the doubt.  The floor had old coffee goo, shoe prints everywhere, and food stains.  I was concerned, but starving, so Darryl and I ordered food and waited.  

Grilled cheese: not only could I see the oil between the cheese, but it was dripping out.  I never experienced greasy grilled cheese before, but apparently it's possible.  Darryl had something that was terribly greasy as well, so we ate what we were going to pay for and prayed for no diarrhea in the end.

The service was terrible, with young men running around not sure what to do.  They were slow as well.  The kitchen staff was young and looked unsure about what they were doing.  The worst part was it didn't look too tidy back there, which made me wonder about the freshness of everything they serve.  

Will I ever eat at a Griddle again?  Probably not.  I am not entirely sure why others do, and I just hope that they fix their little cleanliness issue and vamp up the menu and flavors so they can stay in business."}
{"text":"This place takes forever to make your food!!!!! We waited so long and people ahead of us were getting their food before us."}
{"text":"Sooooo first visit, on a whim while in the neighborhood and HELLO Stacks & Yolks - we have a new local Vegas spot to visit when we're off the strip! Alabama Slamma Stack: not overly peanut butter-y but just enough, eggs scrambled were perfect and Churro French Toast - cinnamon delicious-ness! Also, thanks for the attentive and friendly customer service! Boyfriend and I will be back!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday morning. Was busy like no body's business. About a 30 minute wait. Food was pretty good, but took a while to come out the kitchen."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I've been here 3x now and today was the ONLY visit where the food was good. However, being sat at a table next to the kitchen where the wait staff asses are constantly 2ft from your face while EATING was the last straw. Do NOT seat your patrons within 2ft of your wait staff asses!! The beverage bar/coffee kiosks were on 1 side, wait staff asses on the other, oh, and next to the register too. So customer asses were abundant. Nevermind the fact that there was another table kiddy corner to ours. My boyfriend was so close he could have eaten off that guy's plate. We heard more of their convo than ours. Having a table in the middle of a staff walkway and yet our coffee cups remained empty for long periods of time was awesome. It was a great experience!! I'll never go back. Thanks."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! What a cute little place with a homey feel to it. The staff is polite as could be and the food is so good. I listened to this table next to me grumble and groan (just some grouchy old folks) then the waiter came over, who was tattoo'd up, and I think the older people were excepting bad service based on appearance alone. He had them laughing and carrying on. It was so nice to see people break through the stereotype. The waiter was so patient and accommodating to their crazy requests. My waitress was lovely and helped me from over ordering by really knowing the menu, which is a nice change. The bussers were always there to ask if I needed more water. This will be my \"go to\" place to take people now.
I had the egg white garden skillet, great portion size and of course HAD to try the red velvet pancake, which was amazing!"}
{"text":"I had the breakfast burrito and LOVED it. 

THe place has a very homey feel and fresh squeezed orange juice...

They've got meat that has been marinating for 18 hours, that's something I will try next time.

Service was fast and prices are good too! 

plenty of parking available!"}
{"text":"I booked marked this breakfast spot when my husband decided that we should try to find the best pancakes in town.  Bookmark: Check. Best Pancakes in Town: Not Checked.

Service was ok. Seating is awkward. They have seating right next to the door. Lucky for us we visited on a windy day and the only table available was right next to the door. With this highly coveted table, we were able to enjoy the benefits of a cold gust of wind every time the door opened. We also were able to enjoy a hot coffee when we were first seated AND a cold coffee after a few patrons arrived or departed. As other Yelpers have stated, service was a bit slow so refills to try to keep the coffee at least warm were almost non existent. Tip to the servers: Everyone should have a responsibility in keeping all customers happy. If you see a table that is not assigned to you with a near empty coffee cup and you are bringing coffee for your assigned table, why not just do a quick fill up as you pass by the table that is not yours? It is really a courtesy to the customer more that your coworker.

The pancake options are cool but if you don't have a good base, what you build on it seems to just try to disguise the fact that the base is lacking in flavor and texture.

We won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Had my first experience yesterday for my Birthday with friends . It was delicious ! To start off the waiter had asked if I had to choose wld I do pumpkin or peanut butter ? I said well it's fall season id go with pumpkin .. 5 min later he came bck with a huge pumpkin pancake with a candle inside ! It was delicious !!!! Then we all had chicken fingers & fries , Caesar salad wrap , more pumpkin pancakes & the special of the day carne asada skillet ! I'm surprised at myself that I nvr dined with thm b4 ! I have lived in the Sw area for 9 yrs and usually pass it 3-4 times a wk ... It was so good ! I will return ."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to this place, but every time I come here it gets worse and worse. The service was so bad today (5 minutes to take my drink order, 5 minutes with an empty coffee mug). Also, every time I come the food gets worse as well. This will be the last time come here. It's crowded, breezy, and declining in quality every day. I only go because it's so close to the house."}
{"text":"There are a lot of egg places in Las Vegas. Might all be owned by same company. All the same stuff. Good solid food.

Nice place for brunch and breakfast."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast while waiting for vehicle maintenance. Very attentive wait staff, greeted while entering. Ordered a build your own omelet, crispy bacon. Waitress repeated back my order and offered substitutions without asking. Order was excellent, great taste flavor of the vegetable fresh and tasty. Three very thick slices of beefsteak tomato, mmm. Only one drawback, only Tabasco, Cholula and Tapatio for pepper sauces. ATTENTION restaurant owners, include a cayenne pepper sauce in your selection. I highly recommend Crystal brand pepper sauce, trust me or ask Saint's football fans it's the best flavored cayenne pepper sauce anywhere. Wish I got paid for as much as I recommend and advertise for them. People who know me will be asking what happened to the bottle you carry? I usually have a bottle in my car for just this reason, I did its in the car being maintained. In conclusion, great breakfast moderately priced. Great staff, wait and cook. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the Benedict and as I was eating it, the hollandaise started to coagulate. Pancakes were okay and service was just okay - we had to stop our server each time for a refill, check, and napkins each time she passed because she never checked up on us. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Use to my go to place for pancakes but this time was horrible experience. we had to split a napkin, no knives to spread our butter, pancake was chewy. Food took forever! The quality had gone down. I can see the staff tried and was hustling, but it's so disorganized maybe time for bee manger."}
{"text":"Just came in to satiate a craving for a hearty breakfast at 6pm after a typical night in Vegas. My girlfriend and I ordered Garden Skillets which were incredible and satisfying. I'm as ready for the nightmare drive back to LA as I'll ever be. Big portions, good prices.

Big props to Mickey, he was incredibly friendly, courteous, and gave us great service. My girlfriend usually drinks about 3 cups of water with our meal and her cup was never empty - I don't think I've ever been able to say that before, especially impressive for a joint where you order at the counter! Keep doing the good work my friend!"}
{"text":"I love stacks and yolks! Everytime I come in the owner and staff are very friendly. The meals are very inexpensive and delicious. It's definitely a hole in the wall gem. I would recommend it to anybody.

I first started coming to stacks and yolks when I moved to this side of town. Not too many people knew about it because every time I went in there wasn't many people there. Now everytime I go there's lots of people with a great crowd. However there still no wait time for a table which i think is amazing for the quality of staff and food. 

I usually get the meat lovers scramble but since they've changed their menu, there so many great options now. I'll keep going back anytime. I also love how they have their stacks and yolks challenge. Which is to eat 10 pancakes and 10 eggs in one hour for a free meal and free t-shirt. If you can't do it you owe them $40."}
{"text":"Stacks & Yolks is one of the best breakfast spots in town! They are known for their pancakes. Be sure to try the \"Always November\" a legendary pancake made from Pumpkin Batter topped w whipped cream cheese, whipped cream and sprinkled w cinnamon!"}
{"text":"I live in the area so this is a great weekend spot for breakfast. Take some patience with you very popular spot and very busy place especially on the weekends so you may end up waiting for your table or food a little longer then you think or want but knowing this it going in its not that bad and it's worth the wait the food is absolutely great the staff is friendly helpful and always very nice if in the area this is a must place to stop in and have something to eat. You 
Will be glad you did. This is one place I will continue going back to over and over again for a long time."}
{"text":"Really terrible food! Qe were sat quickly, but the time we actually got our food, it was another 45 minutes! Not to mention the food was cold. If you have come here, I'm warning you DO NOT order the scrambled eggs. Never coming back."}
{"text":"It's weird how 1 call off can throw a business upside down.  Employees tried so hard to be nice & courteous to make up for the lack of good quality food service.  Bad day to visit I guess but we won't take any other chances."}
{"text":"11:30 we walked in & greeted by the bus person. We ordered our food at 11:40 am.  I ordered coffee & asked the waiter for French Vanilla creamer. After waiting 10 minutes, I figured it slipped his mind.  So no biggie I asked the bus lady politely for creamer.  Our waiter over heard me asking her,  apologized & poured the cup of creamer. 

Now I'm starting to notice the people across from us had just gotten their food 35 minutes after we ordered. 12:15pm we asked the bus lady to check on our food she tells us the cook was by himself today.  Oh GREAT!  12:20 rolls around and they served my bf's french toast cold & set his side order in front of me.  So I didn't get my food at all. Lovely.  My bf walks up to tell them his food is cold & the waiter told us, \"it JUST came out\".  The food & plate were cold. So cold the butter didn't even melt! Ha, insulting our intelligence is strike 2. Then he says,  since we had not ate anything we could leave. My response was \"GOOD!\"

 Then come to find out they had a B grade by the health inspector & many demerits in the past.  They were featured on dirty dining (channel 13 news) before the name change.  Steer clear of this place to avoid food poisoning. I thought it was way overpriced for the portion sizes from what I could tell from my bf's order.  It's okay if it's pricey & the food is top notch but that was unacceptable service. They shooed us out the door for their mix ups. I thought we were more than patient with how long the wait was when it wasn't busy. Very disappointed. At least if you're going to have LONG wait times,  give out public wifi.

 We're sitting down at The Cracked Egg on Sunset & Rainbow.  I waited 10 minutes & our food was up. They are reasonably priced for the huge portions. We've gotten coupons in the mail for our loyalty."}
{"text":"Went in today looking forward to a delicious breakfast with my friends. After taking our seat a waiter took about 10 minutes to acknowledge us. They brought us water, but didn't give us more menus until later. We ordered our food. We had a family come in 20 minutes after us and sat besides us and they received their order before us. The waiter did not check up on us or let us know if our food was coming out. The manger just said sorry. We ended up just walking out. Worst service I have ever had."}
{"text":"Nice place for breakfast. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the coffee is a little darker tasting (bitter) than I prefer and they use breakfast potatoes instead of hash-browns. It is a personal thing but I think breakfast potatoes are lazy. If I am going to a breakfast spot I want something that takes more work than I am willing to put in for breakfast at home."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how many times that I've looked at this place on yelp and drooled over the amazing pictures people posted! I can't tell you how much I've drove by and procrastinated about coming here! Well guess what? I could kick myself for not coming here any sooner! It was absolutely fantastic! Yum yum give me some! After searching the menu online and looking at pictures on here prior to arriving I was more than sure on what it was that I was going to decide to order! The meat lovers scramble and the lip kisses pancake I think it's called but basically it's the red velvet pancake with fresh cut strawberries, cream cheese, and chocolate drizzled over the top! It was definitely made to perfection and I will most definitely be returning until I've tried all of the different things that I didn't get to try on today's visit! This place gets pretty packed as it's not the biggest do be prepared to wait! Today we lucked out and only waited less than 10 minutes! The service is fast and friendly! What more could you ask?"}
{"text":"Seriously was AMAZING food. Went there for breakfast. The red velvet and pumpkin pancakes are to DIE FOR. I had the Arizona skillet for breakfast. Huge portions so sharing is recommended. Although I kept the skillet to myself ! Great ambiance and the servers were friendly. Delivery available also. I highly suggest you eat here."}
{"text":"This is a awesome place for breakfast. Normally I would give them 5 stars because they are normally on point for everything. Today they struggled on the service side.  We waited a long time for food and during this long wait. We had a hard time getting our drinks refilled. As much as I like the food here and bring friends in all the time I hope this is a fluke and does not become the norm."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food! Dani was a big help and provided us service with a beautiful smile (: definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"My girl and I stopped in here the other morning for breakfast.

We were promptly seated and our drinks delivered. 

I don't like to be kept waiting to place my order when I'm hungry. So after waiting what I felt was an inordinate amount of time I decided to leave and eat elsewhere.

My girl decided to stay and eat her breakfast. She said the food was good, so we'll maybe try it another time and see if I can get an order placed."}
{"text":"If you're in the Las Vegas area and don't here... you're making a huge mistake. Friendly staff, incredible food - dining here was almost a religious experience. Say hello to Baha for me... 

The pancakes - huge and spongy - yet surprisingly light. Get the peanut butter batter with Nutella and bananas - your mouth may punch you in the face if you don't."}
{"text":"The staff are friendly and inviting. We were seated immediately. I ordered a skillet with the biscuit and gravy. It was delicious. My bf ordered the red velvet pancakes with strawberries and chocolate. Very big portions and very good. The good didn't take long at all. Reasonably priced. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ordered at 12:30 and I'm still waiting its 1:10pm, killing time with the review.  The food was not worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"The food was enjoyable. Had a nice memorable experience until we checked our credit card receipt. They charged us double the original bill. Our bill was$46, but the credit card was charged $92. 

This kind of dishonesty is completely unacceptable. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We had decided to try a new breakfast place and this place popped up, so we went. The food was good. The only issues I had was, I asked for my bacon to be super crispy, not floppy, and when it got there, it was far from crispy. And the service was a bit on the slow side."}
{"text":"My number one complaint for this place is the size, if your are this popular and customers have to wait outside on weekdays consider expanding. My number two complaint is that it takes a really long time to have your coffee filled. Recommendation (leave a carafe of coffee on the table or give out larger mugs)
The food was delicious and I left full. The problem is if I have to wait I'll go someplace else to get breakfast. Hope they expand"}
{"text":"Amazing. Best breakfast food I've ever had anywhere. And super cute location. Kinda lame they make you wait outside for a table but I understand it's small in there and it's worth the wait for sure!! Orange juice is amazing and the pancakes are bigger than your head so don't order 3 like I did the first time . One is sufficient. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place at 7:30 on a Tuesday and they were closed. Sign in window said 9pm. Yelp page said 9pm. Great job honoring your hours. I used to Come here all the but doubt I ever will again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here every time I come to Vegas. They never disappoint the food is always great the staff is friendly and nice. Must try"}
{"text":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!
I signed up just to write a review on this horrible place of business!!!  They started off to a good start. We got our coffee right away, and our order was taken about 5 minutes later.  45mins later....... Still no food!!!  I call over the hostess and ask her why a party of 10 who sat down 20 minutes after us were eating and we still haven't received our meal. 10 minutes later we get our food which wasn't bad. Very unappealing to the eye considering they forgot our order n had to quickly \"throw\" it together!!  They then proceed to give us our bill, which is full price!!  I work in the industry and if we make a mistake we at least try n make up for it. I again call over the hostess (who was the only person who would make any kind of eye contact or even glance our way) and simple explain our whole experience. She then tells me she will talk to someone n try n take care of something......... Only for my card to be charged the full price!!  I have never before been somewhere and something like this happen. My first and last visit!!"}
{"text":"The red velvet and pumpkin pancakes are heaven!!

Excellent service, super friendly staff and beautiful homey setting.
Definitely will go back!!"}
{"text":"We heard about this cafe from a friend and were excited to check it out. Knowing its popularity we got there before 8 am today on Sunday.

Our wait and support staff were great!!!
I had to try the Elvis: a very light peanut butter batter filled with crunchy bacon pieces, topped with banana and powdered sugar. My husband had the chocolate chip pancake with eggs, chicken fried steak and potatoes. The food was great! Potatoes need a little seasoning or even some bits of fried peppers in them.

This is a charming and fun place where you can get breakfast til 9pm!!"}
{"text":"My BF and I go out to breakfast every weekend. We were excited to try this restaurant after a friend raved about it. My BF ordered the ABC omelette and he loved it! I got a scrambler and pancakes. I usually LOVE scramblers but it was tough for me to enjoy this one. It was very bland and had no flavor. However the pancakes were amazing. 

Another big thing to me is cleanliness and attention to detail. I felt like they aren't super clean. We ordered water with lemon and the lemons had pinkish red on them. It made me think it was start of mildew from the container they were in but I wasn't sure. I took the lemons out of our water to be safe. Secondly we ordered coffee. They brought over a big bowl of creamer. It grossed me out because the creamers were dirty and had food on them. I had to wipe them off in order to use it. It had like dried whip cream and chocolate syrup or something like that. Either way, it grossed me out! Also there were white pieces floating in my coffee. I'm sad that this place didn't meet our expectations. I hope they improve their attention to detail and we might give it a second chance sometime in the future."}
{"text":"The food wasn't that great and the service was okay. We should have just gone to our go to spot Baby Stacks. The steak and eggs had no flavor and the potatoes were room temperature. I guess this is what happens when you want breakfast for dinner. The bill was $46 which is fine but if the food was actually good I don't think I would be as ann"}
{"text":"Service was amazing. Food was served quick and tasty. Orange juice was so fresh. Definitely a must try. Great variety of items on the menu."}
{"text":"I don't think I'll be back. There was nothing necessarily really terrible that happened, but it wasn't good. 
Upon being sat all I could notice was how the floors looked like they haven't been cleaned in weeks and there was dust all over the chairs. If the dining room looks like this I could only imagine how the kitchen looks and that was all I was thinking.
I ordered the french toast with strawberries and whipped cream. The whipped cream was absent and the strawberries were old and mushy. However, the french toast it's self was really good. 
Our server never came back to check on us, but dropped the check 5 minutes into when our food came. 
Bad service, dirty restaurant. No thanks."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience at Stacks and Yolks. The dining room was boisterous and inviting. Kinda small, but certainly worth it. The service was top notch and the food was amazing. I can't wait to go back and try more menu items! Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"I really like The Griddle. The food is consistently good! They almost always get you seated immediately, but that doesn't mean they will be there to take your order immediately. They sat us in the back corner booth- which is fine- but it almost seemed like they forgot about us. Granted it was a busy Saturday morning but I have had better service there before. Its a good thing their food is so good otherwise I may not return, but their food is far surpasses what is offered in that area and is worth the wait. If you are around that part of town definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Pancakes like I've never tasted before and so many different kinds.  So yummy!!The service was great, friendly staff, and fun environment.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on Mother's Day, unfortunately his mother couldn't make it so we ended up eating with a huge crowd of families. I was impressed by how busy they were and how well the staff handled it. The place is a little small so hopefully they can expand! I had the Alabama Slammer because Sundays are my cheat days ;)"}
{"text":"Been back several times....good stuff. The food is good on a constant basis, and as usual great staff."}
{"text":"I came here because of all the rage on TV. I visited about a month ago with my kids and sister. Note: I am a server with lots of experience, so I understand what everyone is dealing with at every restaurant I visit. I work for Gordon Ramsay. We wondered why everyone was male.... everyone who works there. All men. We got terrible service, the food was mediocre, and felt a burden. I am still upset today to see fox5 praise this place. Maybe it was an \"off day\".... not sure... but I plan to revisit soon and hopefully change my rating. Please note: I never rate below 4 because, like I said, I work as a server for GR."}
{"text":"As far as comfort and accessibility, I'd give it less stars. I know it's a small place, but we had to stand out in the cold just to wait for a table. And when we were finally seated, we had to squeeze behind another table just to sit down. Then we waited about 5 minutes just for our drink order to be taken! Once we received those, it was another 15 minutes before we got our food order taken. I assume it because there is only 1 cook, so they needed to space out the orders.

As for the food, it came out quick and correct!
The home fries, eggs, and sausage were delicious!!
I also ordered the short stack of cinnamon pancakes! They were great, there was just a little too much of a cinnamon after-taste! Just a little strong for my liking!

This is our second time here, and we just don't think we will come back.
The staff was friendly but not super impressive.
And the space was just too small to feel comfortable."}
{"text":"They do have good food and the workers are kind n courteous. But whenever I go, it's packed and the way the tables are set up, it's crowded enough as it is. On top of that I feel like I wait way too long for food. I'd come more often because it's close to where I live but just for those two reasons alone, I end up going elsewhere. And I like flavored creamer in my coffee because I don't need to add sugar since the flavored creamers are already sweet but they only have plain here which forces me to add sugar. I actually walked out today. I waited 20 minutes and still no food. I noticed the people who got there AFTER I did, got their food before me. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place was everything I thought it would be. Our server Brandon was amazing (thanks for the tip about the Churro Waffles) my brand new favorite!"}
{"text":"I went there on Monday the 19th and I was pleasantly surprised of the layout of the restaurant. It was busy but it wasn't a very long wait to get seated. I thought the breakfast menu looked very good and very thorough and I decided to order an omelette. It was busy but it took approximately 35 minutes for my order to come out and my friends ordered the same. The food tasted ok the portions were about average and the price was consistent about $8-10 an omelette. When the bill came out and the bill was put together we carefully added it up and noticed there was an additional cost of $8 
added to the bill for drinks that we did not have. We spoke to the manager who was very nice added up the bill and determine we were owed 8 dollars. Overall ok food, ok price, sub par service and glad we caught the overcharge."}
{"text":"ALWAYS a great experience!!
I love the fun organized chaos!!
Pick your pancakes
Great skillets
Not the quietest or largest
But for sure the coolest place for breakfast & chatting w/ family & friends!!"}
{"text":"Love this place...great breakfast, great service! Anticipate a wait on Sunday morning, however, great spot to enjoy a good breakfast"}
{"text":"Wow! All i can say is wow! Really wanted to try a new breakfast place and this place was right around the corner.  Sat us within minutes and got us drinks right away.  They make sure to give you extra time because of how big the menu is.

I was in the mood for a Belgian waffle so i just had their plain waffle with a side of bacon.  My boyfriend had the eggs and hash browns and toast and the eggs were cooked to perfection.  Over easy and so gooey and yummy.  His meal was great, mine was really good as well but it to me did not taste like a belgian waffle.  it tasted almost like it was pancake batter more then anything.

When it was time to pay it honestly took about 20 minutes for them to give us our bill after we asked so it was a bit annoying.  Overall the place was to die for and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast. You have to get there early though as it is a small place and after around 10 am or so it gets crowded and there is a wait. The wait staff is friendly and pretty quick with service. I especially liked the oatmeal with fruit - very delicious. And also got the Great Gobbler skillet with biscuit and gravy which was good. Not the best breakfast I've ever had (I prefer Egg Works) and it's a little more pricey than other places. But still, a decent place for breakfast if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment. They're messed up our drink order twice.  The  staff wasnt pleasant at all. They gave us a dirty fork. Food was eh, way over priced. Totally not worth the money."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic and the service is great. The only reason for my 4 (now 1) star review is because I think it's really bad when the owner of the restaurant parks his white Escalade in the handicap spot every time he's here. I've seen it twice now within 2 weeks. He should be leaving those spots for the people that actually need them. The person I was with is handicap and had to park across the parking lot.

The owner still parks in the handicap spot. Witnessed it again today. I haven't been here in months and will definitely not return again because of this."}
{"text":"One of my friends had been talking about this place for a while so I finally got a chance to stop in. It was definitely worth it! The food is loaded with flavor!

I ordered one pancake with vanilla batter and coconut topping. It was a huge pancake! Glad I only got one with the egg and sausage combo. I even stole a bite, or four, from my boyfriend's meat lovers scramble and it was so good! The potatoes mixed in with the egg and meats were moist and huge chunks! 

The only disappointment was the lack of child entertainment. My nephews are small and were getting restless as kids do. A small box of crayons with a coloring sheet or puzzles would have been much appreciated."}
{"text":"Talk about the best pancakes I've ever had.

While out in Vegas visiting a buddy of mine, we decided to get some breakfast and low and behold, I was not ready for these pancakes.
Seriously, these things were unreal. It was their S'more pancake and this thing was heaven on a plate. Nothing short of incredible. I mean, look at those toasted marshmallows on top. The food was so good that we went back a second time before we left, so if that gives you any clue as to how much I liked it, it was a lot.

The restaurant and service were great too. We were there pretty early so it wasn't busy at all. I'm not sure how it is when it's packed, but it did feel like it can get real crammed in there real quick. But hey, if that's what you gotta put up with to have these S'more pancakes, well then you do what you gotta do."}
{"text":"I have been here few times. Under staffed and over priced . Potatoes were way over done and toast was forgot and it basically was untoasted."}
{"text":"AMAZING! best breakfast place around the area. Service was flawless. Our server Brandon was so personable and made great recommendations. Food came out in minutes! Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna say that stacks and yolks is going to give BabyStacks a run for its money, but it's making a run towards my money! 

I didn't think I would find a breakfast place that I would enjoy as much as BabyStacks, but I enjoy Stacks and Yolks just as much. The menu has entrees that are more Americanized than that of BabyStacks, which is more along the lines of Hawaiian and Filipino, and you can see the difference in the demographic of those that eat at the two places just based on the menu. The entrees here give a good amount of good for the price that you pay, and everything that I have had were delicious. Their pancakes here compared to that of BabyStacks are bigger per pancake, but you're probably paying for the same amount of food for a full stack of each, with one Stacks and Yolks pancakes are about equal to two of that at BabyStacks. The pancakes here are really fluffy, which is a major bonus to me! I really love the food here and love coming here for it. 

The only downside to this place for me is the service. They have a lot of young kids working here, as food runners I believe, which isn't a bad thing necessarily, but these kids need to learn about how to cater to customers. I didn't know they didn't carry Cholula, but I didn't know it when I asked. When I asked one of the kids if they had Cholula, all he told me was \"No.\" He didn't give me any alternative options to me and there was an awkward silence until I looked over to see what they had and I just asked for the Tobasco. The waters of my party weren't adequately filled when we has empty cups, the kids just walked by without any regard to our cups. An attentive server was the one to fill our waters up for us minutes later, but it shouldn't have come down to waiter if there were plenty of others that could have done it a lot earlier. Enjoy the food here! Just beware of their service when you eat here, if they haven't started to do things differently."}
{"text":"Had a great dining experience, we were seated quickly, it was clean kinda cute place.  Kate was our waitress very nice gal, my hubby had the biscuits n gravy good tasting, I had the make ur own omelet it was good, n the biscuits was delicious n that hot chocolate was to die for our food was hot oh yes the o/j had a fresh taste like freshly squeezed overall 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we arrive to the restaurant to find out it was closed although the hours stated it was open on Yelp. The hours also posted on the window neon displayed the same incorrect hours. Hopefully they can fix this issue ASAP."}
{"text":"This place rocks! The owner, Baja, is super friendly, as was all the staff. The service was excellent - we were seated right away, and a second later our drink order was taken. Another waitress brought our drinks right after :) I ordered a breakfast burrito, and all the ingredients made it delicious. The potatoes that are served on the side are tasty, just like home cooking. My man ordered the Country Combo, served with an array of fruit on the side. Everything was super fresh!! Very friendly, happy people here!!!"}
{"text":"Yeah....it is that good!
Four kids...three adults....Saturday morning...ready to grub!
Get there early especially if you have a larger party because you are going to wait! It is worth it.
all the kids wanted the happy face pancake and it was huge....all our kids could have split instead of ordering 4....but they were super happy.
I had the carne asada skillet (special that day) and a red velvet pancake and my sister had a coconut pancake....so big and so good (did I mention she hates pancakes and she loved this one). My husband had the corn beef hash....he said it was great but the portion could have been a little bigger (he is a big guy).
Only thing is they don't serve alcohol so have your mimosa or bloody mary before you get there.....
We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Heard the hype about this place and had to check it out... I love pancakes and they have such a verify. 
  Went at 10 on a Sunday morning,  had to wait about a half hour, not to bad. We finally sat down at a table for two which was pretty close to another party of four, like we could hear the whole conversation they had.
  I ordered the mint chocolate chip, paid extra for whip on top... so excited to try this out and well.... not amazing,  not great just ok. The pancakes are huge and two was way to much food. The service  was awesome,  coffee and water filled up fast and food brought out pretty quickly.  Over all, I'd try it again but I'm not sold on it yet."}
{"text":"I don't really like how tight packed the place is. That is the only reason I give it a 4. It kind of ruins the whole vibe dynamic for me because I like privacy.
Otherwise their food was good and fairly quick. I would like to go back and try their pancakes because I heard they have over 10 kinds of different batter. I just had eggs and apple sausage which was good and tasted pretty fresh. It came with s side of seasoned home fries (potatoes, not actual fries) but I didn't eat them cause I was staying away from the starch but they looked amazing."}
{"text":"I wouldn't mind waiting 25 minutes for a meal (after all - if there's a wait, it's usually worth it) but I don't enjoy a hostess with a crappy attitude. It's not WHAT you say but how you say it. And when it's said with indifference and eye rolling... Well, they lost our business today.  The hostess is the front line of customer service and today I would grade her an F.
It's a stark contrast to a week ago when they were understaffed, but because of the chipper attitude of the server, we didn't even care about the wait. 
 The food is good but we can do without the attitude."}
{"text":"I wish I could give no stars! This place is horrible! Their air conditioning wasn't working and it was so hot and miserable. We had arrived and it was slow at that moment with only one party in line ahead of us. We were 2nd in line to be seated but the staff seated people who came in after us. We looked at the list and it clearly showed that our name was next on the list and they incorrectly seated that party. I spoke to management and asked why they had seated people who came in after us, especially since we were next on list. They apologized and said they would get us next and disappeared. Then another couple that came in after us started to take the next table that was opening up.  I noticed that it was happening again and spoke to management again and said you're giving these people who came in after us  what was suppose to be our table again???? She said, \"I'm sorry.\" The people taking the table became argumentative and stated they were next, which was false. The table was near the door and so incredibly hot, so I said never mind I'm leaving. I've never had such a horrible experience in my life. No organization or professionalism. Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and the food is fantastic. Unfortunately today was a terrible experience. Our phoned in to go order wasn't ready and we waited 15 minutes to get the wrong order. Not a huge deal to wait because it's worth it. However drove back to the office and the order was completely wrong. Called the manager and he had a huge attitude! Sorry Mr. Manager your crappy customer service just lost you 3 good customers."}
{"text":"Opportunities:
Reduce the price of a side of pancakes if the customer doesn't want toast. Even if its only fifty cents. 
Better tasting bacon please.


Male server in the morning could be warmer and more sociable.

Probably wont return."}
{"text":"The food seems the same as when it was the Griddle. Not bad Not amazing. Pancakes are big ! The biscuit and gravy woulda been better if the biscuit wasn't hard. One thing that bothered me was the setup of the tables and being in a busy walkway . And there felt like there were sooo many workers working that had nothing to do. I felt smothered every few minutes .."}
{"text":"This was the worst service/ breakfast spot I have ever been to in my 10 yrs in Las Vegas! I heard the food was good and being a huge breakfast foodie I wanted to try it for myself. We went late on a Sunday morning. It was packed and we waited for almost an hr to be seated inside after being told there was only a 20 min wait to begin with. I can deal with that. Here's what I can't understand, sitting for 20 mins without having a single waiter come over for food orders or even drinks. I had to go back to the hostess and ask her if we had a waiter assigned. 5 tables that came in after us were served and got their food before us! I was told by the waitress that finally came over that our waiter got backed up and that's why he didn't come over so she was now helping us without any apologies. I dislike this place very much, food was okay, nothing special not worth the wait or stress. I was charged incorrectly in the end too. I will never come back and tell everyone I know to skip this place, it's horrible...should have went up the street to island flavor instead!"}
{"text":"Both their stacks AND yolks are delicious! Came here yesterday four lunch and again today for pick up during my very short lunch break!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot on this side of town, It's so cute and fun! There are so many unique and exciting pancakes to try along with an assortment of classic breakfast dishes. My favorite by far, is the churro french toast. I also really love the red velvet pancakes. 

The employees have all been sooo amazing & I recommend it to anyone looking for yummy breakfast"}
{"text":"Facts: It's awesome, but small. Just know could be a wait and deal with it. Such variety on the menu it should please anyone! 

Compliments: Great crew of cooks, wait staff and hostess. Met owner, stand up guy who really runs a tight ship. The fruit cups, toppings and fresh squeezed orange juice are top notch...so hard to find ripe fruit in the desert these days.

They seem to be famous for pancakes and waffles...rightfully so, but I'm more of a skillet girl. Hubby and I tried Philly skillet which was great. Comes with a home made biscuit and gravy. Excellent, but I had to order more gravy. 

Mom had buckwheat short stack and said it reminded her of her childhood. Dad had hash and said it was great. Kiddo had red velvet pancakes with strawberries and blueberries (Micky mouse shape of course) which came with bacon.

We all split the mint pancakes with whipped cream and lucky charms...different but very good - more like dessert.

We all loved it!!! This is my second time going and I will be back for sure. I wish these guys the best!"}
{"text":"We went here for brunch on a Sunday morning. When we arrived we were initially told it was a 15-20 minute wait but ended up waiting 1 hour. The hostess was super friendly and accommodating. When we sat down we were seated right in the busy walk way where our drinks were almost knocked over on several occasions. Our waitress didn't even show up to our table for about 10 minutes and when she did she was rude. She brought out our drinks and never came back. When our food came out, our eggs were cold and our pancakes were dry. It took another 15 minutes to flag down our waitress for the check. Overall, I would not recommend. Food was mediocre and service was terrible. Only gave this place 1 star for the nice hostess and the hot chocolate."}
{"text":"Delicious meal and the different options for customizing your pancakes are incredible. The potatoes that accompany the breakfast meals were fantastic! 

I wasn't a fan of the crab cakes Benedict - they were heavily breaded and I was expecting a different lighter breaded crab cake...the accompanying eggs, sauce and potatoes completely made up for it though."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but nothing I would go out of my way to have again. I got the Eggs Benedict and pancakes, and the English muffin was burnt, and potatoes were alright. The pancakes are large, thick and cake-like. The dining area was slightly dirty and the service was slow and inattentive (didn't get the coffee I ordered and then refills were slow). Overall, not the worst breakfast place, but not one I would stand in line for on a Sunday morning either."}
{"text":"The service was OKAY at best. 
Too many waiters and not enough attentiveness coming from them. I don't expect high quality dining for a place like this but when the person handing me my food rolls their eyes at the fact that I need a refill? That's unacceptable.

The food part of my experience was horrible. They recommended the Arizona skillet I believe it was. I was excited to try it giving the hype they built around it. What I got was unseasoned ground beef. Lack luster veggies and sense of regret. Why would anyone pay this much for soo little? I could've paid the same amount at Egg Works or Rise n shine much better places in my opinion. Serves me right I guess for trying something new."}
{"text":"Nasty Breakfast everything overcooked and poor flavor. Skip this place. I couldn't eat the food."}
{"text":"How many wait staff does it take to change a light bulb? I hope not as many as it takes to get a simple coffee and drink order in. 4 diff. Wait staff ask us what we would like to drink over the course of 20 minutes yielding no drinks. Makes no sense. By the time we finally got our hard earned water and coffee we were ready to order. Who actually knows who our food server really was? The food was pretty tasty albeit taking a while to get to us, however by the time we got it I was so hungry that I forgot I ordered a side of bacon that wasn't delivered, until I looked at the check and brought it to their attention. When I went up to the counter, the bacon was coming out, lol. To their credit they took it off the bill, but there's just too many awesome breakfast places in Las Vegas that are more affordable with much better service. Very Disappointed."}
{"text":"I was getting my oil changed at the Jiffy Lube across the street when I spotted this little hole-in-the-wall breakfast place. 

I ordered the corn beef hash; they marinate it in Ale and add peppers and onions for extra flavor. The breakfast was $13.99 and it came with home fries, 3 eggs, and biscuits and gravy. Yes, my meal was almost $14, but they do give you a lot of food for your money. 

All in all, the staff was friendly and the food was good. The home fries tasted like potatoes, and I mean that as in they need more salt or pepper, or any seasoning for that matter. 

So, why the 3 stars and not a hire rating? This place is good, not great. I love the mom and pop atmosphere, and like I said, the staff was friendly. The highlight of my dish was the corn beef hash, but everything else couldn't hold a candle to the main attraction. The potatoes were  bland, the eggs were good, the biscuits and gravy needed more seasoning. 

Will I return? Sure, the next time I need an oil change. Like I said, it was good... Just not great."}
{"text":"The food was soooo good and our waitress was really nice. We were enjoying breakfast until we found hair in my cousin's fries. Luckily they made her another plate. But then we found hair embedded in my pancake. So we all started looking closely at our food and my brother in law found hair on the turkey sausage. 3 plates with hair...I think the cooks needs to wear hair nets."}
{"text":"We liked the place. The owner was really nice and asked for a lot of feedback. One thing we would improve on is coffee. Peanut butter batter for pancakes is great!"}
{"text":"Ok so what happened...I've been here a few times before and while it's not as good as Babystacks, it was still pretty decent. Today, though, was just REALLY bad. Ordered the lumberjack which is just 2 buttermilk pancakes, scrambled eggs and either bacon or sausage (I got sausage). How could they fuck that up, right? Well, they did. The bottom of my pancake was so overcooked that I couldn't cut thru it. My eggs were overcooked as well, they were very rubbery. I felt like I was eating a toy display. The server was nice but was obviously new.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"The day we visited just wasn't a good experience for my husband and I. Super nice people that work there, but I think the wait help was shorthanded that the customer service part suffered. Yup, it happens to the best of them.

We got to the restaurant at about 1 pm so the Saturday brunch was busy. Those that chose to sit outside that came after us, didn't have their orders taken until after my husband and I were seated in the restaurant, which was a good 10-minute wait for them.  My husband and I waited just as long for our orders to be taken as well. 

My husband ordered the corn beef skillet special while I ordered the stack patty melt. Unfortunately, our main dishes came out but the sides that came with the orders, didn't come until another 10-minutes later. My stack patty melt was missing the eggs. So they gave me the eggs separately. I wasn't sure if the egg was supposed to go in the sandwich or on top, so I did one of each.  The hamburger had no taste.

Because of the wait time to put in our order, we rushed it and forgot to order a short stack. So we waited another couple of minutes because I needed my sweets. We ended up taking to go but my husband and I wanted a little taste. When we took it out of the bag, there was no syrup! UGH! The restaurant was starting to clear out by that time so the syrup was delivered rather quickly. Pancakes, fluffy good.

I understand, it was the 4th of July weekend, so I'm sure plenty of employees were out that day. So I am more than happy to change my rating with a better experience the next time. But this next time is going to be a long while from now. Just too many places to check out, ya know?"}
{"text":"Before we even ordered we were greeted right away. Our servers were outstanding. They made jokes and great suggestions. The food is a little pricey for the portion size, but it was very good."}
{"text":"Very solid service, but out of the 3 times I've been in for breakfast, my order was incorrect twice, my wife's once.
The pancakes are creative and the menu has plenty of tasty options, but when you're not sure what's going to be served, you sort of lose faith in the establishment. That, and maybe it was just bad timing, but I've seen cleaner bathrooms at truck-stop gas stations. 
I really tried to like this place because the guys working there seem to genuinely want to provide a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Well decided to try this place out because I have been having pancake cravings lately. We ended up getting an order of cheesy grits, bacon, and pumpkin pancakes. 

So first of all the pumpkin pancakes tasted a bit floury. The tasted like they needed more pumpkin and maybe some cinnamon and nutmeg. The cheesy grits didn't have any cheese (and since it was a to go order so we were stuck!) The bacon was definitely fried quite hard. 

Overall the food was just okay and the staff seemed unorganized (lots of shuffling customers off on other ppl) but this is a fairly new location. I think i may pop back in after a few months and give them a second go to see if things improve before totally writing this place off."}
{"text":"We got here about 10:00 and they told us it would be a 10 minute wait. The first thing I noticed as soon as we walked in was how hot it was in there. It felt cooler outside than it did inside. Also, there's really no indication to where the front door was, which by the way was a bedroom door?? Seems really ghetto. Anyways, we finally get seated around 10:10 and we're sitting there for about 10 minutes before anyone even comes over to greet us and take our drink order. It's now about 10:15 and we order our food after waiting forever to even get our drinks. The couple who was finishing their food next to us had just got up to leave and about 10 minutes later a new couple sat down. There was also an older man who sat behind us who apparently was a regular because they called him by his name. He sat 20 minutes after us and got his food about 10 minutes after ordering when we've been waiting about 20 minutes now. We check the clock and it is now 10:45, still no food. However, the table next to us who came in after us had gotten their food. Mind you, they were regulars too as she hugged the waiter and said I'll see you next week. Everyone who were regulars seemed to have gotten their food very very quick. It's now 11:10 and we still have no food. That's almost AN HOUR with no food. We said we're gonna give it 5 more minutes and then we're leaving, I'm surprised we stuck around that long. Also, this whole time not one single person came to ask us if we needed a refill on drinks, which we did, or ask how we were doing. Not one person for an hour. We finally get our food and it is disgusting. My brother got the lips I believe it was called which is a red velvet pancake. Tasted nothing like red velvet and he just kept saying how the ones at babystacks were a million times better. His girlfriend got the Elvis pancakes which were absolutely disgusting. Didn't taste like peanut butter at all and had the smallest pieces of bacon in them. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. And there's no place to even wait when you check in, they have tables right by the doorway so you're practically standing on top of people while they're eating. We went to go pay which somehow our check was $57 and it's not even a real receipt they write everything down so you can't even see how much anything was. When we paid the woman had a small child there ringing people out. I don't know if she was the owner or what but you shouldn't have children by the kitchen where food is coming from. Definitely wouldn't be coming back here. It was also pretty dirty inside."}
{"text":"First time there today and the workers were so nice and personable. I ordered the fruit oatmeal while my boyfriend ordered the corned beef hash. Both were delicious. Pretty fast service and affordable Id say"}
{"text":"great food and good prices!  Very small place, but worth the wait. It is decorated very cute! Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I just went there for my second time yesterday and all I can say is WOW! Their pancakes are  incomparable to anything I've had...EVER!! The first time I had the \"Always November\" it was rich in flavor and tasted exactly like November with that pumpkin batter and all of the toppings!  Then yesterday, I had the \"Alabama Slamma\" and being a fan of peanut butter already, it was everything I could hope for topped with bananas, chocolate chips and almonds with whipped cream. I can't wait to visit again! I have to try all the signature stacks! Oh and those cakes are huge which in my mind justifies the price!"}
{"text":"We usually eat at the one on S Durango and it's fantastic.  However...
This one started out with surprisingly bland food-coconut and Nutella pancakes were tasty but vanilla was nothing special.  Potatoes were over cooked.  Bacon was super fatty.  
What topped it off were the BUGS on the wall that we spotted near the end of our meal.  We were going to tell our waitress but she had disappeared and, apparently, so had more service, etc. we had to ask one of the bussing people for our check.
We went up to pay and then noticed the \"B\" health department grade-I asked if B stood for bugs and the cashier replied, \"oh yeah, we've tried bombing but they keep coming back\".  
Well, that's encouraging.  We will stick to the Durango location."}
{"text":"Came here over egg works because we like the decor and food better, knowing it would be more difficult to get a table at 12pm on a Sunday. Quoted 15 minutes for a table, took closer to 30. Little chilly waiting outside. They should offer coffee to waiting guests. Finally sat, waited 5 minutes to be greeted. Gave our entire order when she arrived. We come here for their different Benedicts. The best part is the runny yolk mixing with the hollandaise. Both of our plates pretty much had hard boiled eggs. Potatoes were cold. The place is busy. 20-25 tables or so. Maybe 2 servers? Staff up!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Only one suggestion-please offer REAL maple syrup. The pancakes are soooo good. Maple syrup would make them perfect!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best breakfast joint you can find anywhere. It's such a nice, comfortable, and friendly atmosphere. I ordered the Western Skillet with biscuits and gravy...it was so delicious. You can tell that they make everything with passion. I recommend this to everyone because you won't find another place like this anywhere."}
{"text":"So... Wanted to try this place for a while because it is located by where I used to live. On my to Wet N Wild, I decided this was the opportunity! We see a good amount of people waiting thinking \"ohhh, this is going to be good. Let's see the wait.\" The hostess says about 15-20 minutes. Awesome! 30 minutes later we are walked to our table. Coffee was delivered and food orders were taken. One person in our party asked about \"specials\" which we later understood are just overpriced items... The opposite of a special. Anyway, food took an hour to come out. Portuguese sausage taste like tire. Eggs were over cooked. Potatoes undercooked, some black. Pancakes were decent. Not worth the wait :/"}
{"text":"We were recommended this restaurant by a blackjack dealer at the Palms. My family loves trying new places each visit to Vegas and especially the local favorites.  So happy to have tried and will be back again.  I had the lemon pancakes and they were delicious. My eyes were bigger than my stomach though so I should have only got one pancake (I got 2) because they are quite large. My husband had a build your own omelette and was very happy with the way the omelette was prepared. 

Solid service by the whole team, our server was attentive and helpful with our questions as first time visitors.  There was a consistent flow of people which goes to show the popularity (and we were dining on a Monday around 10am.)"}
{"text":"Oh how I love this place! Customer service is always great and dishes are delish! Especially their pancakes which not to mention are huge. I'm a sucker for good, fluffy pancakes and all the different flavors/options they have are great. Have never been disappointed when eating here. My only complaint is how tiny the restaurant is especially since it's normally always crowded. I avoid getting an aisle table if possible just because I feel crammed when I do."}
{"text":"Food was awesome waitress were friendly but service was terrible they took long to take our order then when they finally did we were rushed to order,food took long then we were never checked on we needed our drinks refilled then  we were charge for a refill I seen the waitress refill coffee 5 times to the couple next to us but that's ok food was good."}
{"text":"A Friend of mine refer this place for breakfast. Now I'm a fan food is delicious portions are big you can share with someone. 
Orange juice is fresh. Staff super friendly and nice.
Service is a little bit slow but nothing mayor"}
{"text":"Like seriously, CANNOT GET ENOUGH OF THIS PLACE! Like, SERIOUSLY! My FAVE is the Elvis Hotcakes! OMYUM! The perfect blend of sweet and savory with neither one of them over powering the other! Careful though, the hotcakes are like the size of a UFO! Ok, not that big, but one is seriously enough if you order it with eggs and stuff!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are weekly guests here and it seems like the staff turn-over is extremely high.  Each time we come back there are all new people except for one or two.  Today there was a child working there that couldn't have been more than 11 or 12.  I'm pretty sure that's illegal.   The restaurant is small and the tables are packed in.  Today not only was my favorite waitress not there, the bathroom door was broken so you had to take your chances on someone walking in on you.  I don't want to find a different place to eat breakfast every Sunday but I will."}
{"text":"Just has some red velvet pancakes with strawberries and cream cheese frosting over the moon so good in addition to our hobo skillet with biscuits and gravy on the side left with full bellies and happy faces.  We plan on going back before we finish our vacation can't wait for the next visit"}
{"text":"As you can see by the pictures I've posted the lowest I could give this place for everything is a one star only because there working on Mother's Day. Other than that coming here for the first time was a mistake. Not because it was busy but from the food to service wasn't worth it. We got seated pretty fast and we sat right where the food was coming out. The expo guy was useless. The way he was talking to servers was rude and cussed knowing my 4 year old is sitting right there. He doesn't see the food in the window and makes someone else get it and they all seemed to be running around like chickens with no heads no organization at all and nothing is getting done. Tell me why servers takes one plate out at a time like hello you have two hands. I saw one server come to her moms table takes a bit of her sandwich and goes to grab customers food orders that's been sitting there getting cold brings it out and doesn't bother to even wash her hands disgusting. When we got our food my hash browns was cold, my kids pancakes and bacon was warm I guess and our skillet thinking the food would be hot no it wasn't it was cold besides the eggs on top and I watched it come out the window fresh but why the hell would it be cold when they just put it out don't make sense. No one checked on us we had to flag servers down for things like refill coffees and clean forks because they were all dirty. We got our checks before anyone could even ask or notice our food was cold so nasty and now I got a tummy  ache. Not worth going to you guys need new people I was literally going to get up and run that all by myself I'm sure I'd do a better job at it and have my partner step in the back and run that kitchen making sure the food gets out on time and still hot. Oh I almost forgot the expo guy was saying it's ok if it's out late everyone can wait make them wait like wth."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome selection of pancakes, great service, and we will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Good breakfast.  The jalapeño bacon was awesome.  The employees were all very nice.  I gave them a $20 tip so they could make some money and they didn't really even thank me.  I'm just going to purchase the food from the counter from now on.  They have a lot of food that I want to try so I will be back."}
{"text":"Very cute little restaurant with very tasty food. The servers were friendly but we did have to send them back a couple of times for parts of our meals that were missing. I'd imagine it gets much busier on the weekends and there isn't much room to wait, so I'd definitely suggest visiting during the day. I had a full stack of birthday cake pancakes that were awesome, and my cousin had the marinated beef tips which smelled great and he said they were great."}
{"text":"We had a really good experience here.  Friendly waitress and great food. I had the chicken fried steak scramble, which was delicious! My wife had the bacon and eggs combo breakfast. We loved the creativity of the menu, \"marinated in unicorn tears\" and \"bacon sent from heaven\". The food was cooked perfectly and the bacon wasn't paper thin like most breakfast joints. The decor was very modern and clean. We would have given this place 5 stars, but our food needed just a touch more seasoning and some hot sauce."}
{"text":"We go every Father's Day. The food has always been good. It takes a bit to get your food which is good because they actually make it not heat it up. 3 years and counting."}
{"text":"This location is near the La Bonitas Supermarket. It used to be the Country Cafe but same owners. We arrived at 9:30am on a Saturday morning. There was no wait to be seated. We were attended to quickly. Our waiters and servers were very attentive. I ordered the lemon blueberry pancake with a blueberry compote topping. It was a single stack large enough serving to fill me up. I shared the corned beef hash with my friend. My favorite was their pancake. It was a fun new place to try. All my friends told me great things about this place. Perhaps I had high expectations, but I found the restaurant to be mediocre."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot!  Share size portions!  Quick and convenient service!  Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"You'll be fine as long as you avoid their potatoes.  They're undercooked and flavorless. I had eggs over medium with an English muffin and some bacon. Totally delicious. The coffee wasn't bad. Better than at Babystacks, which isn't saying a lot.  

I didn't have pancakes, but they looked amazing. Lots of options for toppings, and each costs about $1.  Great service."}
{"text":"Food was great service was ok, but what chaps my hide is there seating.  We're like sardines, and the waitress, are constantly passing by you and bumping you.  The person behind you is bumping you.  I will refuse these seats next time.  I will wait on a booth.  Com'on Stacks and yokes take care of your customers!  You will still get your coin!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, it's close to my house so it's super convenient. My first experience here was really good. I had the delicious chicken on top of waffles with the meat lovers scramble on the side. My friend had the red velvet pancakes with biscuits and gravy. She let me try it and it was delicious. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a tasty breakfast spot."}
{"text":"The service was the best part of breakfast. 
With that said, the pancakes are huge...beyond huge, gigantic in size. They were flavorless and the watered down syrup didn't help. The eggs were eggs. The bacon was hard, not crunchy but hard. The hash browns were shredded potatoes and didn't really have a taste but didn't seem to be cooked throughout. 
Again the server was funny and attentive but food was a big disappointment. I very rarely leave a restaurant feeling like it was a waste of money. This time I did. 
This was the first and last time time I will be going here but in full disclosure I have not tried their lunch and it may be better."}
{"text":"Cute breakfast place, although it's a bit small. Our server was very attentive and she made suggestions since it was our first time. I had the chorizo scramble which was really good--sometimes chorizo can get really greasy but this wasn't greasy at all. My husband had the meat lovers scramble which was also really good. We split a single pancake--peanut butter batter with Nutella....wow, yum! If I wasn't diabetic I would have gone with the pancakes for my main dish, they have lots of variety and the few bites I had were delish! This isn't our side of town but we will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to say today was NOT a good experience. As you can see from my last review we were more than pleased! The reason why I am choosing to even leave this review is in hopes the owner sees it and does something about it!
 We came in were immediately seated and our server was pleasant. I can't say that mine, my husband or daughters food was memorable BUT not bad. My sister in law came along today and ordered the morticai something and asked the server if it was authentic she said yes! Got the recipe from morticai himself, server came back and said it wasn't available today. My sister in law asked why server went to ask and came back and said they will make it.
 When her food arrived it wasn't what it should have been, eggs were over cooked and then the tomato soup/sauce was like water.
 Server was saddened and said she was sorry talked to owner/manager they took 5$ off. Server also said he blamed her for  her for the food and said it must be her problem and to leave if she wasn't happy.
 She was NOT the problem! The food was and now his poor attitude!!
The guy came back looked to see how much was ate and walked away.
 We paid bill started walking out and I stopped by the guy and just said it would have been nice if he would have talked to us, he said ok. My sister in law told him that we wouldn't come back because it wasn't ok or professional  and he said good I don't want you back. Chased us out the door telling us to never come back and he didn't want to see us again.
 I know it must be hard to learn someone doesn't like the food BUT it was one meal Instead of losing 5$ and being ok with it he in return lost our whole families business.
 It's sad and this isn't the way a business should be ran! We won't be back BUT I hope whoever owns this restaurant can read this and help this man fix it or he won't have it for much longer."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and everytime we have had a great meal at a great price and even better service !"}
{"text":"I give Stacks & Yolks 5 stars because of our server Brandon. The food was awesome but his service was better. I'll be back to frequent here..!"}
{"text":"I used to drive up and down this part of town too frequently but never made a stop at the Griddle. A year later my chance to stop by finally came!

I had no expectations for The Griddle BUT figured it was probably alright since its been open for years (not many businesses can say that yeah?)

The daily special during my visit was the corn beef hash (made from REAL brisket) and was delicious! It was served with biscuits and gravy (meh), eggs, and maybe something else. HOWEVER it was $14, holysht, probably would not order again unless my wallet was overflowing with money. That is a lot of money for an off strip, eggs and hash brown joint. 

French Toast and the Red Velvet pancake was also ordered. The prices for each at $2.99 was a bit of a steal considering its large proportions, could easily get satisfied with one pancake. The Red Velvet pancake was sub par though, it felt more like a small cake rather than a huge pancake with chocolate syrup. 

Skip the coffee, unless you enjoy black water. 

Overall it cost $40 for 2 entrees, 1 pancake, 1 french toast, and a coffee. A bit steep, but mostly contributed from the corn beef hash. Service was friendly, the waiter was nice and communicated well. I would probably come back since my cousin loves this place, but definitely to try different items."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and great service. One of the best breakfast restaurants in Vegas in my opinion."}
{"text":"It's good-ish. I LOVE pancakes some would say obsessed with them and when I went hunting for a new place to feed my addiction I set my sights upon this magical place. Reading the reviews on yokes it gave off a meh appeal to anyone who hasn't been here but we went on a whim and went for it. We arrived around 1030 in the morning and the place had a medium level crowd and we were able to sit right away, from there our waitress took our drink orders and then dissappeared for the rest of the stay I think we were served by everyone on staff because at one point another server came by took our food orders and I believe the chef came by and dropped the food off as well as gave drink refills. 

Food wise the selection is exciting, you can make your own pancake with a choice of making it a combo (eggs and bacon)  for around 10 bucks. I ordered mint batter with nutella on top because why not and went ham on it. The wait was around 20 minutes which is not as bad as the other ratings were and the wait was worth it because ooo man were these things huge. You can pretty much just order the cakes on their own and they would feed you for at least the rest of the day. The  eggs were good but the bacon was actually legit thick bacon, I am not talking about the regular thin wimpy  bacon I'm talking wow this actually came from a pig bacon that was actually crispy and not limp.( that's what she said) The cakes  were great, not dry or lacking in flavour just awesomness all around. 

So, would I recommend? Yes I would, the food alone is great. The only thing that was annoying was the service as it took the owner actually coming over to deliver the food to get my coffe refilled. So if you want some monster cakes this is the place but if you want great food as well as better service maybe look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times. The food is always decent and just what you order. The issue is the customer service. In our most recent experience we walked up and were offered to wait or to be seated on the patio. We chose the patio as it was not very warm yet. Once seated we waited no less than 35 min to have our order taken or water brought to our table. Once our orders were taken it took at least 20 min to get our food. Then waited another 5 to get silverware. No drink refills on the water we had were ever offered. We finished our breakfast. Paid the check and left. Not planning on visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Came her today with my Friend and serves was over the top great , Will and Brandon  are funny and respectful it's great to cheer the mood with a warm family oriented restaurant! Have to say so far the best breakfast I've had in a while at a restaurant..."}
{"text":"Wonderful Pumpkin Batter Pancakes, with the right amount of whip cream, cinnamon and cream cheese...yum! Orange juice full of pulp to fight the scurvy. Boyfriend had the  Meat Lovers skillet...he also rated 4 stars. Only questionable item- dirty windows, they make you look around a little. But next time we're in town, we will be back!"}
{"text":"The first time I had breakfast at stacks and yolks I was in love!  The place was small, yet comfortable, the staff were all friendly. But it was the food that had me itching to come back. Then I did and my second visit was just disappointing. It was so bad I haven't gone back, though I think I might one day.

My first trip I got the philly cheese steak skillet and I subbed the mushrooms for fresh jalapeños. It was wonderful: perfectly cooked eggs, tender beef, fluffy potatoes, flavorful melted cheese, all kept screaming hot by the skillet throughout my meal.

It was one of the first meals I've had in awhile that compelled me to come back to the same restaurant in a week.  

The second time I came in nothing was the same. Our server wasn't as nice, the atmosphere was louder and uncomfortable. Worst of all, the food was awful. I ordered the same breakfast, cooked the same way and received something completely different. My eggs weren't cooked right, the jalapeños were barely cooked at all, and the there was considerably less beef on the plate.  Yes plate! They served my skillet breakfast on a regular plate this time, which killed the presentation, didn't keep the food warm (much less hot), and altogether defeated the purpose of ordering a skillet. Such a big let down.

Like I said, I'll probably go back one day since it's so close to my house, I'm just not ready to yet.  It's worth checking out if you're looking for a nearby breakfast place that's decent, just don't expect consistency."}
{"text":"Great place. The staff is very attentive and nice. 
The food is very good and come hungry. The biscuit and gravey was excellent. I got a single stack November pancake. As with the rest of the food, excellent! Great orange juice too what can I say."}
{"text":"I like the place, but it's extremely small.  The food is excellent, the service was prompt and friendly and the menu offers more choices than you would expect.  My only gripe is that for me going out to eat is a social occasion where I visit with friends I don't get to see on a regular basis so I like to sit and chat.  They try to turn the tables too fast for my taste due to their small storefront.  Other than that one complaint, I really enjoyed the meal and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"HATE  Nothing.

DISLIKE  I had to ask a busser to grab the server since she took her time to take my order.

LIKE  The bacon and eggs. The potatoes. Attentive busser. Decent menu selection.

LOVE  Protein option for pancake batter."}
{"text":"Ive been here several times now and each experience has been great! Good food, and friendly atmospere.  Waits can be a little long on weekends, but the usually put out a little coffee set up when lones are long. Would definitely reccomend!"}
{"text":"We moved to this SW part of town in 2009 and have been regulars here since back when Baha called it The Griddle.  The pancakes are hands down the best in town.  But my favorite dish is the Steak Tips (marinated for 18 hrs in unicorn tears).  I've never had a dish here I didn't like.  The staff here is always super friendly and easy going, which I've come to appreciate more and more over time.  Since we started coming here, my wife and I have had two kids ... and anyone who has kids knows you don't travel light and you always leave a trail.

My only complaint is that I've bragged about this place so much that it's gotten really busy ... some times I can't get in.  Luckily, they extended their hours to 9pm.  We just had breakfast for dinner tonight and it was great!"}
{"text":"A long wait and poor seating system and the food  was sub-par for the price. Overall was not a fan and won't be back.

We were told seating would take 20-25 minutes, 45 minutes later we were seated.

Potatoes were partly frozen and cold. Pancakes were rubbery, eggs were very bland and the sausage was not cooked through.

They did have good orange juice though, although we did order three and got two different sizes for no reason."}
{"text":"This was my first time and quite possibly my last time to come here. Although there was many people waiting to be seated; our smiling hostess seated within 10 mins of arrival. This was probably the only positive. One employee took our drink order and almost immediately brought it. The utensils were dirty and thrown together on our table. Then, another employee, supposedly our waitress, took our order. I requested to have a high chair for my child and was never given it until I asked again. But that was when we finally received our food. Food presentation was unacceptable and the high chair was down right dirty. Throughout most of our meal we were never checked on. Also, I finished one cup of coffee and it was never filled again until I asked. The employee I asked looked at me and said she will get it in a few minutes. She then turned around and proceeded to set up silverware. It could've taken her 2 mins to turn around walk three steps to the coffee and fill but still she proceeded to set up her silverware. Another employee who was working another section is the only person who came over to ask if we needed anything. When I requested the coffee she immediately went to get it. But the other waitress came and filled my cup only half way. 
Now it normally takes a lot for me to write a review, but I hope that this establishment improves. I can guarantee that I'm not the only one who had an unfortunate experience on Mother's Day. The table next to us asked for their toast more than three times and was told it'll take a minute and it'll be right out. They finished their meal and never received their toast until they asked for their check. I've worked in customer service for over 10 years and this was by far the worst service ever received."}
{"text":"Food isn't that good and the Biscuits and Gravey was the worst ever .Don't order the eggs Benedict either"}
{"text":"This has been a semi-regular breakfast and lunch stop since I moved to this end of town a few years ago.  I've done both take out and dine in and primarily stick with the breakfast foods (scrambles, pancakes, eggs, etc).  The food is always delicious.  The service has always been good, which brings me to the three stars.  The service is good when you can get service. 

I've had four separate occasions in the last year where I (and my partner or guest) have gone in to sit down and could not get service.  Twice was due to being flat out ignored by the server and the restaurant wasn't full.
The other two times (including my last attempted visit) were because they did not have enough servers on duty and therefore the wait just to get a drink or put in an order was extraordinarily long.

I like this place when they are on point.  I understand it can be hard to staff and people call in, but their staffing issues are no longer my problem.  I'll go on to the next breakfast place, and I have."}
{"text":"Got our food fourty and fifty minutes after ordering. (Different times). Staff forgot our order and scrambled to get our food for two on a moderately non busy Sunday.(my order was wrong tho). When the server brought our food we did not receive an apology she then rudely said \"we good?\". Really? I'm sorry but that's garbage. Never coming here again"}
{"text":"Today my daughter and I went to see how good they were expecially seeing them on channel 5 and we were in 7th Heaven, excellent food"}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this place. Food was mediocre all the silverware we received were already used and haven't been washed. Pancakes were cold, managers were rude when we spoke to them. NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN"}
{"text":"Waited for a table for 3 for 10 mins longer then told it would be. Finally sat down and waited another 8 minutes before ANYONE asked about drinks. Another 10 for creamer, have yet to be asked if anyone wants a refill. Can't comment on food since its been 30mins and we're still waiting..I can say, the fresh squeezed orange juice was good.
... Can comment on food ... 
Got a meat lovers skillet, meat lovers pancakes, a gluten free pancake, and fruit
Although the service is to be desired, the food is delicious
CARLOS was great...the only one I observed to hustle and be alert to the customers..even those that weren't his"}
{"text":"I went to have quick breakfast and they were busy that day , I asked to be sit outside because it was totally full inside , the host was nice , I sat outside at the same time as the other party , I waited 15 mins to get someone to take my order , the food was great , the server was good , I understand she was busy , but again don't seat a party until you make sure you have a server who is ready to serve , not having the guests sat and waited for over 10 mins"}
{"text":"I didn't love this place... When we arrived it was busy but not too bad, we were seated immediately. Our waitress was very nice and friendly we ordered the Monterey skillet, carne asada breakfast burrito and got some red velvet pancakes to go. The food took awhile probably 45 minutes or so and no one came by for refills. I was soooo hungry when the food arrived, the potatoes in the skillet were phenomenal and the carne asada burrito was tasty too! The Monterey skillet comes with chicken, veggies, feta and the potatoes but mine was probably 80 percent potatoes which was a little disappointing. I also ordered my eggs over medium but they were all over hard I guess because none were runny at all. The red velvet pancakes were good too but more than a couple bites and the sweetness is overwhelming. In conclusion I'd rather stay home and make myself eggs and toast"}
{"text":"Not impressed. As a Chef on the strip I know how quick food can be made and the  service that should be provided.

Party of 2, we ordered two simple breakfasts plates, eggs and sausage (comes with home fries and toast) and a corned beef hash and eggs. 

Waited about 25 minutes to get the food and by then our cups were empty and no one had bothered to check on us and refill. 

Finished our food with still empty cups, then a random server comes and sets up the table for the next people as if she couldnt wait for us to leave. 

I asked for the check, waited another 10 minutes for it, finally got offered a refill, when I finally got the check no pen was provided. I had to get up and ask the host for a pen. 

Not happy with the service or food."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I've been here frequently and lately just isn't what it used to be. It seems that frequently they take a long time to make your food. I ordered marinated steak tips. The food was late, there was probably 2 tables that got in after I did and they received their food first still. Once the food got there, the potatoes where cold, the egg was undercooked and just wasn't good. Its been like this for probably the last 2-3 times I've been here and I just kept saying to myself that it was probably a day where they were short staffed or something so I kept giving them a pass. Not this last time, that is the last time I go there for sure. Plenty better places to go to at this price. They get by off of their old reputation but like I said this place just isn't the same."}
{"text":"Horrible. The sausage was frozen in the middle, the toast wasn't toasted, potatoes had no seasoning, coffee tasted like soap. Do they ever try their own food?"}
{"text":"We ordered carryout this morning from the Gluten Free menu.  The Veggie Scramble was fair, and the Garden Benedict was also fair.  The eggs on the Benedict were way over cooked, and the potatoes were inconsistent - some pieces were crispy, others were under cooked.  The part of the breakfast that was INEDIBLE were the gluten free pancakes.  OMG.  When I say DISGUSTING I am not exaggerating even one small iota.  They were the size of a human head, and weighed as much as one.  They were so dense and gross, I took one bite, and spit them out.  I make GF pancakes at home, using BIsquick GF mix which are actually lighter and fluffier than \"regular pancakes\"....I do not know what these people are using for a GF MIX, but they need to change it ASAP.  they were absolutely repugnant.   We will not be coming back here, which is a shame, since they're a stone's throw from the house."}
{"text":"Off the chain delicious. Had the Alabama Slamma pancakes are so light and fluffy. And the Eggs Benedict loved it. Branden was our server Who was excellent. Thanks for a great breakfast"}
{"text":"Best. Bfast joint. Hands. Down. Always use them for a pre race fuel up. The hashbrowns, French toast and waffles are my favorite. They also extended hours to 9pm now."}
{"text":"Came here once when it was still called the griddle and it was not that good. When the name changed to stacks and yolks my wife wanted to try it because we thought it was new owner. When we arrived we realized it was same owner different name, we decided to try it anyways. 

We were seated quickly even though there was a line, which was nice. The server was friendly and took our drink and food orders quickly also. 

This is were stacks and yolks starts to lose points. It took 30 minutes for our food to come out. Even the server told us he didn't know why it was taking so long. 

When food finally arrived I thought it was going to be the best tasting breakfast because it took so long. Sadly I was wrong. 

I ordered a breakfast burrito, which was very plain. There was no seasoning on any of it. The onions and bell peppers were diced so large and weren't fully cooked. It had the hard crunchy taste and flavor. The potatoes were semi warm and soggy. Would've been better if fried a little longer. 

My wife ordered a sausage Benedict. The bagel was plain, the sausage was basic and the egg was over cooked. The only good thing was the hollandaise sauce. She ordered a fruit bowl instead of potatoes and even that wasn't good. 

Overall the food is what I expected at Denny's. I definitely won't go back again. There are better options such as cracked egg and egg works."}
{"text":"This is a really great tasting restaurant, however it's very expensive. $50 for a family of 3, and one little one who only ate bites off our plates. Service was terrible. And they literally sit customers on top of each other. The couple sitting next to us had to get out of their seats just so I could take my 6 month old into the bathroom. That's not fair to them. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Shout out to the amazing buss girl on shift today, she was amazing, super helpful and amongst doing her job did a better job then our server, checked on our drinks WAYYYYY before our server thought to ask."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot. I love the skillets and you can't go wrong with any of them. Sometimes there is a wait and not really any room so you just have to stand. But the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"There was a pretty long wait, but for the most part it was worth the wait. The staff was very nice and attentive. The red velvet pancakes were phenomenal. I love the red velvets at Babystacks, but the ones at Stacks and Yolks blew those away. I also tried the chicken breast and waffle. The chicken was amazing, but the waffle was nothing special. Together, it was really good though. I'd recommend this place, but try to avoid the prime breakfast times because the wait is long."}
{"text":"Heard about this place on Fox 5 morning show and came here with my daughter. I got California eggs Benedict and my daughter got meat lovers scramble and a buttermilk pancake and man everything was great!!! Huge portions and great service!!"}
{"text":"Ok food. Our waitress looked and acted miserable. Had multiple issues with her forgetting things even though she wrote our order down. He response was \"oh I must not have heard you\" ummmm....I saw you writing as I was talking. We had plenty of food leftover and she never offered to go boxes, just the check. Never got one refill and drinks we ordered never came. There was a young gentleman server however that was servicing other tables and he was a gem. I asked him for stuff I needed like to go boxes because our waitress was MIA. There was only 4 tables filled so it's really ridiculous to get such poor service."}
{"text":"Food was great. Had the Cornbeef hash and eggs. No complaints with the food. But I got forgotten because I sat outside. Waiter came a total of 3 times. Once for my drink, once to give me my food and lastly to get my plate when I was finished. Ran out of coffee mid meal and didn't get a refill. They were busy so I get why. May return again. Word of advice, don't sit outside on any table next to the wall of restaurant. It's a blind spot."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great vibe. I recommend it to anyone! Bahador and his crew is not only friendly but treats everyone like family. Love it!! Now GO CHECK IT OUT!!!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 6 for my birthday and my daughter's birthday.  The staff was very friendly and patient with our ordering.  The atmosphere was very busy and we enjoyed watching them cooking in the open area.  This place was recommended by our apartment manager and staff so we gave it a try.  It was wonderful.  I had the Eggs Benedict Crab cake.  I took 1/2 of it home and it tasted just as good reheated.  Everyone loved their food.  The hot chocolate was to die for, came with a huge mound of whipped cream with chocolate sauce and sprinkled with cinnamon.  The only negative was we were charged for extra mayonnaise for a sandwich.  That we didn't understand.  Other than that, it was $85 for 6 of us, which included our drinks, not bad.  This is a very busy place every day, and very crowded, so you may have to wait.  Only open until 3-pm. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Pancakes are tasty and BIG. However, they aren't blow my mind away. 
We got lemon blueberry pancakes and they were fluffy and light. They had great lemon flavor and scent. The blueberry popped as well, but with all the hype on this place I hear on the radio I was expecting just a tad more. ....

I got a warm spinach chicken salad cooked with olive oil instead of butter. Very good, but after a few bites the oil is just too much. I asked for very light oil but oh well. I did love the LARGE chunks of garlic tossed in. 

Would I come back? Not for a while and this would be a last resort place."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast in my area. Over 10 kinds of pancake batters and lots of skillet dishes! Big portions and friendly staff."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars, I would. The experience was horrible. We waited 45 minutes for our food, watched and tried to figure out why  the other tables were sending their food back to the kitchen... When our food arrived, we found out why... 

I ordered the western skillet. Which should include , ham, green peppers, onions and cheese. I had those things, including chicken. I figured what the heck, I'll eat it anyway; until I realized that I could not due to the pool of grease that was sitting on the plate. 

My friend ordered a pancake... Of course when it was delivered it was the wrong pancake and was so dry that you could barely swallow it. And... It was gray??? 

We explained the situation to the server, who apologized and informed us that the owner was willing to take $5 off of our $40 bill. I explained that I hadn't eaten any of my breakfast and I was not going to pay for the skillet. The owner approached our table and started screaming at me, that it was no grease on my plate... It was tomato juice... There was NO TOMATOES in my food. He told us to leave and never come back. We tipped our server and left the establishment. I will never return to this place. 

Please save yourself the trip."}
{"text":"First of all the service here is impeccable. I had two servers who wanted to take my order. I haven't had two men fight over me since college...that's my story and I am sticking to it. 

RUDY won. Lucky him. He was a great server. Everyone was very friendly. Even the server who \"lost\" asked me how everything was when I was finished. Another server filled my coffee. The owner is present and his staff seems really happy so I betting this is a great place to work. Happy servers equals great service. 

I got the orange cranberry pancakes with whipped cream cheese and whipped cream at the suggestion of Rudy. Boy, was he on the money. There are a lot of different flavors of pancakes I had a hard time deciding what flavor to get. I had the short stack the pancakes are as big as the plate. One was enough. My eyes rolled back in my head.  I am coming back tomorrow. I am not kidding.  I ordered home fries.  They were good but I wished they'd had more seasoning. 

See ya tomorrow guys!"}
{"text":"Menu is pretty awesome. Food was great and came out super fast!!! I would have given it 5 stars but our server wasn't friendly, helpful or efficient. I'll definitely be back. Hopefully I'll get a different one. Lol"}
{"text":"3 stars for gluten free pancakes!

My family of four visited Stacks and Yolks today. My husband ordered the lumberjack with banana pancakes. He liked his meal and they had Cholula :-) My oldest ordered blueberry and chocolate chip pancakes. She really liked the combination! She made it a combo with bacon and eggs. My youngest ordered the gluten free pancakes with chocolate chips. Now these pancakes are huge and she ate 1 2/3rds! Plus bacon and eggs as well. She really liked them.
Now, for me. I tried to order the clubhouse sandwich but they were out of turkey. Next I tried to order the Veggie Melt, but they were out of eggplant. So I settled on a BLT on wheat. The bread was over-toasted - almost black in some places. There wasnt much bacon but what there was had crispiness to it. I ordered a side salad instead of fries. The bleu cheese tasted like ranch :-( 
But the worst part of our meal was the flies and heat. The front door was WIDE open so two flies joined us and we left sweaty.
I wouldn't go back myself, but it is hard to find gluten free pancakes at a restaurant."}
{"text":"We came in to Stack n Yolks in a Sunday morning around 10am. It is definitely not a kid/family friendly spot. The quality of food and service has majorly declined since they opened. They were out of all their juices even we came in. My pancakes were super burnt. The tables are unnecessarily close to each other. Im absolutely blown away that there's no changing tables in the restrooms. Rude. Just rude. The bathrooms were comparable to that of a truck stop. Filthy floors, out of TP, over flowing trash can. They also didn't offer my 3 year old a kids menu or crayons. Again, this definitely is not a place for kids. Won't be returning anytime soon. We'll stick to other breakfast spots."}
{"text":"The service was great! Friendly & attentive. We tried the Arizona skillet with biscuit & gravy. We also got a buttermilk pancake...It was HUGE! The food was good. I also had a hot chocolate & the whipped topping was amazingly pretty. Very yummy."}
{"text":"Most of the time the staff is friendly and the lines are short. However, if you go on the weekend mornings they are way understaffed and the lines can be very very long. There are a couple checkers who are snippy and short tempered, but generally the rest of the staff was very helpful. I like shopping at the specific location because anytime I need help finding something there's always someone there to help me."}
{"text":"I don't mind the food. It is the unfriendly service I have an issue with. I've been here 3 times, and twice I felt like it was a sin to smile or be friendly. I really felt trapped once I sat down, but wanted to make a run out of there just to end the bad experience. How difficult is it to smile and be cheery? Gets you more customers plus nicer tips."}
{"text":"A couple of my friends and I wanted some hearty American breakfast after a fun but draining weekend in Vegas. We split up with our group and decided to eat here. We got our food to-go but scarfed it down at an outside table before we met up with our group. We got the eggs benedict and a stack of hotcakes. The eggs benedict came with potatoes. Both were delicious and well-seasoned. It was creamy and not overly salty. The English muffin was nicely grilled. I loved the fact that they gave us lots of hollandaise sauce. One disappointment was the eggs were overpoached. Eggs benedict should be runny, but the yolk almost cooked all the way through. The hotcakes were hot, huge and fluffy. Service was great and helpful for our needs to be quick. Overall, pretty delicious breakfast food."}
{"text":"I don't know why people don't like this place . I thought it was awesome . Very good food , good pricing and great service and it's the day after thanksgiving !!! This will be my go to breakfast spot when we have friends and family in town"}
{"text":"Been waiting for nearly an hour for our food and still no sign of it. When I asked what the problem was I was told  \"our normal cook is on vaca\".  Terrible service today!!!"}
{"text":"This location is still fairly new so I'm giving them that excuse to the hour long wait time for our food. It wasn't even unusually busy."}
{"text":"Eating here for breakfast as we speak. Every seat in the restaurant is sat, all of the guests look as content as I feel, and every employee in here is running their tail end off. Thoroughly impressed, and thats not even including the food.... which is amazing by the way. We just dropped by on chance, and I'm very glad we did!"}
{"text":"I may as well have ordered a stack of pancakes on my head and a couple yolks to the face for brunch. They were a disaster today. We arrived around noon well after the Saturday breakfast rush and didn't experience a wait to be seated, which was one of the only pleasant parts of this visit.

There are hiccups in service & then there are flat out belches. We got a bit of both here. From getting a cute plate of sausage patties delivered instead of the patty melt I ordered, to my friend's waffle coming out 20 minutes after his eggs & potatoes did, this was becoming wayyy too much and too little in record time! I also got fries instead of the breakfast potatoes I ordered, which was also a fun bonus. 

While it did take forever for all of our correct food to appear, it was all actually very good (praise the Lordt). Asked for a refill on water & quite a bit of it ended up on us instead of in the glass, which was fine. Had just come down from a hike, so that part was actually kinda refreshing. Don't have much of a reason to go back, but maybe this was just a fluke."}
{"text":"Giving this place 1 star.. Is being pretty nice. Saturday I placed a order over the phone and the lady said 20-25 minutes. I left to pick up and pay right after I placed the order cause that's about how long it took me to get there. I get there and my food was ready  paid, got my order and left. When I got back home and got ready to eat... HALF MY ORDER was missing. I called back up there and of course my food was still up there. The lady told me \" yea you left it on the counter \" First off I asked if that was all of it BEFORE I left. So I had to go back up there.. They were so rude and my food was cold! Maybe if the man at the register rang ONE person up at a time this wouldn't have happened. A waste of my time,gas and $40.00. Never again will I return to this place. Next time make sure people's orders are ALL together for pick up!"}
{"text":"I  wanted to like this place.  It seemed promising from the reviews.  

First impression was okay - the hostess was friendly.  The staff was friendly and attentive.

Pros:
I had the Eggs Benedict Florentine.  It was good. The potatoes were really tasty.

Cons:
We ordered a side stack of pancakes with bananas and Nutella.  They were okay.  They were out of Nutella.

*It was pretty warm inside.
*Place seems crowded with tables too close.
*Couldn't use the bathroom as the stench was nauseating.  
*Food took too long to come.  We were sitting there for quite a while.

Overall, I think my 1st experience was not the best and I am not sure if we'll be back or not."}
{"text":"The other day I had an intense craving for some red velvet pancakes but unfortunately had to work late. Then I remembered that I had noticed Stacks and Yolks is open until 9pm now and had been wanting to try it. 

The place has very cute decor. I love the way that they've set up the restaurant, the logo is clever and they even have well designed merch for purchase. I looked up at the wall in front of me and noticed a big advertisement to vote for them in Best of Las Vegas. They seemed to be doing everything right (which is why I gave them 3 instead of 2 stars). 

My brother and I both ordered a short stack of red velvet pancakes with whipped cream. They came out looking beautiful--great presentation. When I took a bite though I was very happy to be facing away from the man working there because I made an obvious face of disgust. The pancakes were downright gross. They were dense and gummy and the only thing that indicated that they were red velvet was the bright color. They were topped with raspberry (not the best choice) and chocolate drizzle over very cheap whipped cream (which I paid a dollar extra for). My brother couldn't even finish half of his. We both left disappointed and with stomach aches. 

This place appears to have potential to be great, but the pancakes I had were so bad that I don't even care to try any other food they offer. It's a shame."}
{"text":"We did a phone order & it took about 15-20mins until it was ready, so not that bad. There pancake portions are big but the taste of the pancakes could be better & The French toast were alright, not something that gives you the \"ooooooh\" or \"mhmmmm\". When we got back home, we noticed that they didn't give us all our food & it wasn't only 1 thing that was missing, it was quite a few. Then of course we had to drive back to go get the rest of the food."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast at 1:00 today. I expected Sunday to be busy. Ordered seasoned steak ... all 3 of us. It had a not so great taste ... huge chunks that were super tough... well done and dry. Couldn't eat the steak so immediately ordered a Belgium waffle. After we had all finished breakfast I told them to cancel the waffle... they were kind but brought an overly brown waffle... I said no thanks. They did offer to cook another and give it to me free... by that time I no longer wanted a waffle. 

The cook wasn't that busy the entire time I waited for the waffle... the waitresses were just standing around . 

Have eaten here twice before and all went well and food and service good. 

My suggestion to Stacks... stick to what you know... pancakes and waffles... to charge $15+ for bits of tough, dry, and way over cooked steak ... well it doesn't reflect well on your restaurant."}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes were tasty, but the consistency was a little rubbery. I have never been before, but my brother who is a local says they are usually better. They were OK, but I was expecting more given all the mentions in the reviews below.

We sat outside which was nice and our server was new but did very well. I wouldn't have imagined she was on her second day unless she told us."}
{"text":"Very good food and service.  Jessica was our server and was super cool.  I ordered the \" hangover cure\" and it was bomb!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place! I come here all the time and I have never had a bad experience!
The portions are quite large, and the staff is always friendly. The best time to come here is dinner time because it can get to be a loooong wait in the late morning/early afternoon.
I have waited 30 minutes before, which I don't mind!
I am also a pancake fanatic, and these are my favorite pancakes!"}
{"text":"I love this place and thats why im giving it two stars ,but don't come in on Sunday mornings , it's been 45 since I placed my order and my eggs have not arrived , this review is only about the sloooow service on Sundays and not about the food taste or quality, this is a breakfast joint , you would think they'll be prepared for a Sunday morning since they didn't change their menu or anything, damn it I'm hungry and still waiting.........     10 more min just passed , not a single person as come to my table to let me know whats going on with my food,  I'm leaving"}
{"text":"First of all someone who has a variety of flavored pancakes doesn't make them a great breakfast restaurant. Don't get me wrong the staff was very friendly but the coffee tasted like watered down espresso beans and I actually went next store to dunkin donuts to get our coffee. After placing our order of two single stack(s) combos it took over 45 minutes for the food to arrive. This nice older gentleman brought the order from the kitchen was very polite. 

As for the food. The only thing that was done right was the over medium eggs. The scrambled eggs where over done and dry. The pancakes where edible but nothing special. The bacon that came with the combo was well done on one side and raw on the other. How this place could possibly be voted best in Las Vegas is beyond me. 

Oh one last thing before you go to sit down in the restroom make sure there is toilet paper cause I made the unfortunate mistake of assuming there would be some."}
{"text":"I think I made the worst decision to start my day by post mating breakfast from here. I heard a lot of hype over this place & I think that's mostly what it is. Hype. I mean i know  not to expect the best freshest tasting food if I'm getting it delivered or to go , but damn. This was terrible. I ordered the country fried steak with over easy eggs for my boyfriend & corned beef hash also with over easy eggs for myself. The country fried steak was super thin & the gravy was straight bland. The corn beef hash looked like dog food & tasted like the corned beef hash u get out of a can from the dollar store . Nothing special at all. Oh & our eggs were pretty much almost cooked over hard & the toast was literally crunchy. The only thing good was the potatoes. Maybe they just don't put in the same amount of care into cooking their food for take outs as they do for dine in customers because there are really good reviews. I don't know. If y'all are looking for some good corned beef hash & chicken fried steak, go to baby stacks. That's where I should have ordered from."}
{"text":"Brandon, Francesca and the rest of the crew are great.  Positive attitudes and personalities.  The menu has many options and always cooked the way I like. If I want quick, I get quick. If I want to lounge I lounge."}
{"text":"Well this is definitely my favorite breakfast and lunch spot! The first time I ordered the Griddle which is 3 eggs the way you like chicken feta spinach and mushrooms on top of home fries...oh and some pita bread on the side. Wow!!! Not your ordinary breakfast and oh so delicious. I get this quiet often because of how much I love it. There is also the option of getting it on a griddle instead and you get the option of getting toast or biscuit and gravy. 

So let's talk about the gravy!!! Holy crap it brought me back to when I was younger. I have never in my 27 years been able to find another gravy like the one I used to eat as a child so this gravy hit the spot.

I have tried the Arizona, French toast, chicken pesto sandwich, chorizo and eggs with peppers, Egg's Florentine, and a few other things and I have never once been let down! It gets busy and full at times but the staff is ALWAYS great and we are seated promptly. Great place, great food, great staff!!"}
{"text":"Nice cozy place for breakfast. Their orange juice is my favorite,they make it in front of you. The food is good and staffs are friendly. It is not the first time and won't be the last time."}
{"text":"Take your money and go to Egg Works, at least you'll be happy with what you're paying for. 

We were told it would be about a 20 minute wait, but we weren't offered to sit at the empty table outside that we then sat in while we waited? Granted maybe we should have asked to sit there, but I was kind of flabbergasted. 

The hostess sat us and brought out dirty silverware, with food residue and grease splatter. After asking one of the 4 floaters on the floor for a replacement, I ended up spoonless. Womp, womp. 

No one introduced themselves, we had 5 people come to our table over the course of the meal so no clue who I was supposed to ask for the check. Just a kitchen nightmare vibe all around. 

If I would have enjoyed my experience, or the food, I might have laughed at the \"I'll see what I can do\" remark when I asked for milk with the not so great coffee. Know your audience."}
{"text":"The wait was about 15 minutes which is nothing compared to the food!! It was worth the wait. The steak tips which are amazing since they are marinated in unicorn tears. That alone had my attention. Ray our server was very welcoming and attended to our requests. I will be visiting this location again. The other order that was made was a omelet and the veggies were very fresh. Thank you for the wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Came here based on a friend's recommendation and the fun menu. It was busy but not packed, and we had a few different servers checking in the whole time. They were all nice, but not super informative. A table behind us that was seated after us had their check long before we had our food. Our two young kids were restless and hungry while we waited almost 45 minutes for food, that then came out with some mistakes. Food was just ok. No need to go back."}
{"text":"Good pancakes, awful service.

Arrived just after 11am on a weekday morning. It is obvious that service staff are not trained well - there were maybe 12 tables seated tops, but despite 3 waitstaff, we'd honestly have been better off if it'd been a counter service place! We were seated not too long after entering, but it took nearly 15 mins before anyone even brought us a menu (this is my pet peeve - I would have left had I been by myself), another 10+ minutes before anyone bothered taking our order, and another 25 minutes before our food even arrived. Nearly one hour after being seated to get our food at a place like this? Yikes. Servers never proactively filled our drinks either - we had to ask every time. And when we mentioned the long waits when paying our bill, the lady at the register just shrugged.

It's a shame as I liked my \"November\" pancakes - great flavor on these pumpkin pancakes with a nice, slightly moist texture - really good with syrup and the cream cheese topping. The rest of my party seemed to like their food as well. Too bad the service ensures I'll never be back."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE breakfast place, you can tell everything is made with love unlike ihop. The philly skillet is my go to! It comes with 2 eggs of your choice, toast or biscuit n gravy. I crave it everyday because it's sooo good. Their chicken and waffles is also so yummy! When i go i ALWAYS have to order both because i can never choose which one i want. The owners are such kind hearted people. Sometimes service there is a little slow which is why i give them four stars but other than that, it's Jennie Approved!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't very good, we did get it to go though. The potatoes were very soggy and the bread was hardly toasted so it was cold and chewy. The biggest issue was the customer service. We ordered two large drinks and received a small one and one only 3/4 full. When I called the restaurant to refund the $4 for the small drink, he was very rude and said \"Well, send someone back in for the other 4 ounces.\""}
{"text":"Great customer service. Food was on the o.k. side, but nothing that makes you say \"WOW!\" Like the decor. The area you go to to pay the bill puts you standing in the middle of traffic. Not very practical. Tried the corned beef and hash breakfast with a side of biscuits topped with gravy. Also tried the eggs, bacon, and lemon pancakes breakfast. Corned beef and hash was dull and boring. Completely void of flavor just like the potatoes. Hot sauce to the rescue! Biscuits and gravy was pleasantly good. Put gravy on anything and it is usually great. The lemon pancakes had good flavor and was also pleasant. Friendly and helpful customer service. Got to try something different next time. Tried the Hobo Skillet and it was delicious. Still used hot sauce, but it had its own good flavors."}
{"text":"Excellent service thank you four youngsters they were efficient they were diligent and well-mannered good job guys !"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast today, service was terrible. We had to ask for napkins, silverware, syrup (for the pancakes we ordered) we shouldn't have to ask for that, the sever should just bring it. Half of our order was forgotten about & we had to ask for the rest of it. We were 3 adults & a small child, not a large party to wait on. It wasn't busy enough to warrant such garbage service. The only item we didn't have to ask for was the check. I've been here a couple times before & each time the service wasn't great, but today was the worst & final straw."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in for breakfast today and it was my first time here! Staff was super attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. I had the Monterey Skillet with the biscuits and gravy. My friend had the LumberJack breakfast. Everything was cooked to perfection. Brandon and Kylee were amazing and made the atmosphere so much fun! (Which is hard to accomplish at 8am) this is definitely our new go-to breakfast spot !"}
{"text":"I went on my birthday fir a family breakfast. The food was good with good service. The pancakes are to big. The staff should inform on the size before ordering. I will go again"}
{"text":"I came to this location when it first opened, and decided not to write my review at that time since I expected the service and wait time to be slow. Today I came in, and it wasn't nearly as busy as the previous time, so I expected it to go a lot quicker. We waited about 15 minutes to sit down, got our drink order taken pretty quickly; however, the food was a different story. It took the waitress a while to come back, so we had to get her attention so she could take our order. When our food finally came out, about 40 minutes later, it came out in parts. I got my skillet with no toast, ketchup or hot sauce. It was simply just dropped off. My husband and son still had to wait an additional 15 minutes for their food. We ordered the Alabama Slama pancake which we never got, but still got charged for. The food was ok, but the service is ridiculous at this place. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was great! I had the one stack with eggs and bacon. The bacon was crispy, eggs were yummy and my lemon and blueberry pancakes were awesome. My husband had chicken and waffles that were great. I'm only giving 4 stars because we had three different servers and service was slow. 

We will return again though, as the menu has so many options."}
{"text":"My buddy had the sirloin tips for breakfast which were cooked and seasoned PERFECTLY ......I had the birthday pancakes.  The food was on point and staff was so kind and amazing.  Going back for the pumpkin and mint pancakes soon :) Thx Guys!!"}
{"text":"Service has gone down hill. This place use to be great. Staff is terrible. They forget your drinks, food comes out cold, you don't get any silverware. You have to ask for it."}
{"text":"I have seen this place as i drive by and there is always a crowd waiting usually, a good indication the food is good. It was blustery Vegas day, very uncommon, so there was immediate seating outside and i took it. 

Service response was a little slow but not to upsetting but the food came quickly. The service also picked up as i went from 1 to 3 people. 

The food was ok not sure why the wait or the people  who kept walking up talking about how amazing the place is. Considering there are 3 breakfast spots i am aware of in the area within a short drive i am not sure why people wait. 

Probably not a spot i will return unless its a convenience stop. In closing the service is ok the food is ok nothing bad to say about this place but not a place i would stand in line for."}
{"text":"I stopped in for breakfast this morning on the way to the Las Vegas Great Santa Run and I was glad I did.  I ordered the lemon, blueberry pancakes.  Coffee was brought quickly and refilled without me asking for it.

The breakfast was ready quickly and it was delivered hot.  The lemon flavor along with the blueberries in the batter made for a nice combination.  I did not make a combo of my breakfast.  For $2.99 more, you can get two eggs and bacon or sausage.  That would have been too much breakfast for me.

I read the reviews on Yelp before going here and a few mention cleanliness.  That's something that's apparently not a problem anymore.  The floor was spotless except for some foot prints at the door and the tables were clean.

This is a very pleasant, small place.  I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Small restaurant that's almost always busy! I've been here a few times for Sunday brunch and it's never less than a 20-30 minute wait. The food is good, but they never have the buckwheat pancakes, as listed on the menu."}
{"text":"Today we went for our first time after seeing this business on the news. It's wasn't a good experience. We were seated and took 10 mins to have our waiter come and take our order. They were under staffed and we were told that's why we had been waiting. Our food took 35 mins to arrive to us. My order was complete but my side of potatoes looks as if someone had sneaked a few bits before I got it. My wife had a combo and only got her pancakes. We had waited for our server but never check on us so we had to asked at the counter and were told it's on it's way. But never came. Our friend order eggs and was cooked incorrectly we sent it back. We ended up just sharing what ever food we had. The service was unacceptable and the server put blame on the \"new\" cook. Only person that was helpful was the guy who gave us our drinks and food. They had tried to charge us for everything that we didn't get. And only were accepting cash. 

We will not go back to this place again. They need to get there stuff together. Better system and better people. (Server had a very bad attitude and was non apologetic)."}
{"text":"Most horrible experience ever! Wait was long, food was just ok. Coffee was gross! I asked for another one but got a coffee with lip stick marks eeeww!! My kids sprite was nasty, no syrup! Asked for an extra plate but got a dirty one! Place is dirty and last of all asked for our bill 40.65, gave $50 and she said need change? My husband said no and she didn't even say thank u, come again!! We're definitely not going back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Get the Always November pancake...it's the best decision you can make!

Great service, food was out quickly, and it was delicious! 

Cute set up as well."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice. And there will be no more attempts.  The first time the boyfriend and i came in around 9:00AM on a Tuesday. Wasn't  busy, and were sat right away. Waiter seemed pleasant, order was taken abruptly. We only had water to drink. He ordered a meat omelet,  and i (being vegetarian and not a huge fan of breakfast food) ordered a veggie burger. After waiting about 10 minutes, the waiter comes over to inform me that they were out of veggie burgers. However,  from where i was sitting i could see the cook, and because it was slow,  saw him physically leaning over the counter as if he were tired or just plain lazy; i had a sneaking suspicion that he just didn't want to go to the \"effort\" of preparing the veggie burger.  Ended up ordering a vegetable omelet. Food was decent,  nothing special,  but still edible. 

Second time: came by myself on a weekday (mainly because it's right across the street) waitress took about 10 minutes to come over.  Restaurant was full,  but not on a wait.  Waitress was very disinterested and cold. (However she seemed to really warm up when she was tending to her male tables) 

I ordered water and the veggie burger AGAIN. At least 15 minutes went by and she came by to inform me they are out of veggie burgers. AGAIN. She asks me if i want something else, but doesn't bring me a menu. I guess she assumes i know the ENTIRE menu by heart. I ask for a menu,  which she returns with 5 minutes later. They don't have a huge vegetarian selection,  so i was ready to order relatively quickly. I waited about 10 minutes for her to come back but she never did.  I finally asked  another server to get her for me. Another 5 or so minutes go by,  and she returns.  I order a veggie omelet,  adding feta cheese.  A good 20 minutes goes by.  No food.  Empty water glass. 15 more minutes go by.  No food. No water. Waitress comes over with the check and says flatly, \"I'll take it when you're ready\". She must have noticed my pissed off and confused look and asked if i needed something. I said \"yes. A refill and my food\". She looked confused; which i don't understand, seeing as how a perfectly clean, folded napkin and clean silverware were sitting on the table. She doesn't say a word,  just walks away. 10 more minutes go by,  and as I'm about to walk out,  the food comes. Without feta. I ask about the cheese,  and annoyed,  she leaves to bring me a very small side of cold,  feta cheese. Food was the same mediocre omelet i had the first time,  with less than an ounce of cheese. Fortunately, i had worked the night before so i had cash on me; I didn't want to wait another 15 minutes for her to run my debit card and scowl at me. NEVER. AGAIN."}
{"text":"Stacks and Yolks is a great place to kill time waiting for your food. I ordered scrambled eggs and bacon and it took over an hour. An hour for scrambled eggs and bacon, let that sink in for a moment. This was my second attempt to eat there and I'm done. The service sucks, the kitchen sucks, and an hour wait for the simplest breakfast dish is ridiculous."}
{"text":"The food and service are phenomenal!!! Fast service. Food came out faster than I expected. It was perfect! Definitely recommend the Always November pancakes - when you get to the center you'll find an amazing surprise. Also the eggs Benedict spinach Florentine was great!"}
{"text":"Just breakfast and lunch, with an emphasis on breakfast. I love that the waffle and pancake choices include not only what they put ON them, but also what goes IN them. I had orange/cranberry IN the batter, and strawberries and bananas ON my waffle. It was really good but the cranberries were a bit overwhelming. It's about $3 more to add bacon and eggs if you're hungry enough for them. I stuck with the waffle and was completely satisfied. They had a breakfast special running with marinated steak that look and smelled wonderful. Maybe I'll venture away from my usual next time and give that a try. You can spend from $5 to $15 per person so if you're watching the budget (like I am toward the end of the month) you can still find a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Took 5 tries to get my coffee refilled. We waited over 40 minutes for our hash and it came out burnt."}
{"text":"Basic breakfast place. The seating was really crowded and it seemed chaotic. It was also a bit humid feeling."}
{"text":"Good food all around.  Staff is very friendly.  My biggest criticism is that their syrup is so watery.  For a place that prides itself on the kind of food that pretty much requires syrup, I would think that you would feel compelled to serve a better quality syrup."}
{"text":"I had waffles  with strawberries and  whipped  cream hardly any cream and strawberries  service was terrible .waited. Every time  I  asked for coffee  I will not be  going back"}
{"text":"Popped in on a whim for breakfast.  Glad we did.  

The place is super cute and casual.  Seat yourself, peruse the menu...

We opted to share corned beef hash and eggs, and a short stack of lemon blueberry pancakes.  Yum.  Everything was great.  Hash was the good stuff (out of the can).  It was surprisingly not heavy or greasy at all!  Cooked very nicely.  Eggs were done right, potatoes were chunky, toast was buttery, pancakes were flavorful and a nice consistency.  

Lots of fun sounding pancake options including peanut butter, coconut, red velvet, marble and so on.  

We had 2 breakfasts, 2 coffees, and leftovers to take home for $22. Not bad at all.  I would definitely go again.  We were pleased with the food and the server got us everything we needed."}
{"text":"Was craving breakfast so I yelped & found this place! Was empty when we walked in but our waitress was really nice & always checking up on us. Gave a lot of food! Wasn't expecting so much! We left so full! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The owner,  Baha, heard about the two fallen LVMPD Officers and immediately felt the need to host a fund raiser.  He opened his doors and donated a portion of the proceeds for that day.   A great sum of money was raised for the IPOF.  We went in to accept the charity and stayed for breakfast.   The food was amazing and the atmosphere was great.   It felt really good to meet someone that is giving back to the community.   Thank you so much for everything."}
{"text":"Food was great but my god the service is enough to make you think about walking out before your meal even gets to the table.

We walk in, are told to sit anywhere that's clean and help ourselves to a corner booth. After maybe 10 minutes of looking around and watching guests who came in after us get menus and drinks, bro comes over and says \"you guys need menus?\" No, I'm here for the wifi and scenery. Of course I need a menu. 

Another 10 minutes passes and a different girl comes over and says \"have you ordered yet?\" That was the extent of conversation from her. 

Third person who appears to be the line cook delivers our food in reasonable timing but the order isn't complete, my bacon and eggs are missing. 

The food was actually really good and I have no complaints in that regard, but in the middle of our meal a fourth server who we hadn't seen came by and dropped our check and walked away. 

Server number 5 came to take the bill 10 minutes after we put a card on the table and by this point I was so over it. 

Seems like this is a common experience out here based on the yelp reviews and there are enough breakfast spots in this town to choose from that I'll take my business elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Wow! What can I say....this restaurant was filthy the day I stopped in. From my table so could see the build-up of crud under the counter and in the corners of the baseboard around the place. I had already ordered; so stayed to eat.....my mistake. The food was not good, service worse. PLEASE don't waste your money. I would not walk in that building again, even for a free meal. Yuck."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfasy today and it was so good. A little bit on the pricey side but otherwise was so good. The service was great and was really quick. Will definitely be going back soon to try some mint chocolate pancakes!"}
{"text":"The love for corn beef hash has me coming to this spot once a month . The servers are always friendly and getting better with the speediness of service."}
{"text":"Decided to try it despite the bad reviews and knew it was a mistake after I sat for 20 minutes for someone to take my drink order. I was ready to order food by then but they didn't take it because they were there to take my drink order only. Whatever. I waited another 10 minutes and someone finally came around. That was the last time I saw my waitress other than to give me the check (with miscalculated tax). Someone else brought my food and napkins and the box I asked for.

The food was nothing special. If I had to choose between this and making my own eggs at home I would just save my money. The one star I am giving is because of their crafty hot chocolate that my 9 year old loved. 

Oh and did I mention I sat by the bathrooms?! Normally it's not a big deal, except today when they decided to spend 45 minutes cleaning it while I ate. Nothing like the smell of a dirty bathroom and trash and toilet paper by your table to season your appetite. 

I'll keep my money. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I wish I could tell you about this place but both times I've attempted to go ive been unable to get a table. The last straw was this morning when I put my name on the list and was told there would be a 15 minute wait. I walked to D&D, got a coffee and came back. It took approximately six minutes. I patiently waited and finally asked the girls seating people if I had been missed. She claims she called my name but I never heard it. I'm done. Terrible service experience, but that's par for the course these days isn't it?"}
{"text":"We came on a Wednesday morning and honestly I was surprised how busy they were for a Wednesday ! There were only two waiters (female and male) and they were hustling around and really provided awesome service despite the busyness ! Food came out in a decent time and it was delicious! I ordered the meat lovers scramble and it was awesome! Everything about it was perfect and the biscuits and gravy were fantastic! We also got the pumpkin pancakes and YUMMMMMYYY!!! Totally coming back, mainly for the awesome service ! Was really impressed with how short staffed they were."}
{"text":"I had the red velvet pancakes and I thought they were good, I wish they were more moist but overall I thought for the price they were a good deal. The menu has a lot of variety and seeming all the food come out makes you wanna come back!"}
{"text":"Please... I hope management realizes that their customer service need more attention. Just can't be friendly when clients come in. Mistakes do happen but it would be more appreciated if you admit to them. Staff was so guilty, they pretty much avoided passing by our table. 

Otherwise, Smuckers strawberry jam was on point. Food was just alright."}
{"text":"Just bad, it looked good on TV, but the actuality was unfortunately quite lacking. There's nothing interesting about any of the dishes, the \"home fries\" are un-seasoned, under-cooked, and plain potatoes. The vegetables are too old to be served, and the meats ( probably from a Jimmy Dean package) come in two ways: burnt or raw. Make breakfast at home before spending valuable time and money"}
{"text":"Awesome pancakes!  Driving by and stopped in, had no idea what to expect. Brandon and Andrew took good care of us and made excellent recommendations. The \"Always November\" pancakes were amazing. Light and fluffy pumpkin cream pancakes with just the right amount of pumpkin spice to keep it light, not over powering. Super good, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. First visit,  I had a red velvet pancake, which was yummy & sweet. Second visit,  I had Kit's corned beef hash with eggs & a biscuit covered in country gravy.. it was so good!  The staff was very friendly, & I like the decor. It's also close to home,  so I can't complain. 

The reviews on Yelp seem pretty mixed on this place. I wonder if it's based on who's cooking & serving for the day."}
{"text":"Terrible experience!
Asked for Over-Medium Eggs but got the runniest eggs I have ever been served. The potatoes where greasy & had a taste of overdue ham. The corn beef hash looked and tasted from a can. The side of bacon was undercooked and low grade. The orange juice was warm. The coffee was bitter. The service nothing to be remembered. The outrageous $53 with tip for two people breakfast was not cool!
I certainly will not be back. Best of Las Vegas is not!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast/brunch spot I've found in North Las Vegas. Eggs were cooked perfectly for my wife.. Which is a difficult task. Loved the food. Fast service even though it.was crowded.
Death before decaf!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious (marinated steak tips and eggs, orange cranberry pancake and biscuits n gravy)!!! Service was excellent. Food value :)"}
{"text":"The best invention are the churro waffles! They are to die for if you have a sweet tooth  like me"}
{"text":"I sit in the restaurant as I write this review. If I could give 0 stars, I would. HORRIBLE SERVICE. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. There was a group of 5 of us. They sat us and it took about 20 minutes to get a drink. I wanted to order the parfait but was curious what kind of yogurt was in it, (greek or regular). The waiter said, \"I've never sold one and I don't know what it is.\" Well thats helpful and seems promising.   Our breakfast came but was missing many things. They trickled in but seemeed to take forever. By the time one was done with their meal the next pieve xould roll in. Pancakes were ordered but somehow syrup was never delivered and was not on the table. Coffee and water refills had to be requested instead of offered. After our plates sat empty for 20 minutes the bill came. We needed it split and figured it was easiest if we let them do it with checks versus giving 3 cards to try and figure it out. The waiter comes over after another waiter took it to him and says, \"I know you want this split but I don't remember who got what\" Simply, zero skills this guy had because apparently ordering in a circle doesn't have a rhyme or reason. He then goes to split it and returns with the craziest thing I've ever heard, \"My manager has requested you come up there. He's really controlling and I had it but he wants to do it.\" We proceed to the counter with the check and cards in hand. The manager was less than plesant. I will NEVER return there nor refer people there for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"We've come twice now and both times we were the only ones in the restaurant, which was not a bad thing! We got to pick the best seat and had fast service. I've been getting the French toast with chocolate chips. Seriously so yummy. 
We had the server with the slightly long black hair. He's really great and doesn't forget anything."}
{"text":"Not the best service and the food was okay. I wouldnt get excited if someone wanted to go here again, but i would go if someone else was treating me and my meal was free because the food wasnt worth the money."}
{"text":"This place deserves a solid 3.5 stars. The food was definitely 3.5, the atmosphere was nice, service was good. However, there was a tiny smell of sewer (both inside and outside) when we dined at this restaurant, which was masked easily by the smell of our coffee."}
{"text":"Met the owner, very nice man. The service was excellent and so was the food. Had an omelet made with more than your normal stuff and it was great and they were willing to exchange unwanted items for choose ones without a problem. 

Highly recommend and I will be returning for breakfast again."}
{"text":"I haven't  eaten here in months due to bad experiences in the past and what a waste my phone in order was wrong as always. People avoid this place they have mediocre food and customer service is terrible!"}
{"text":"Super good breakfast joint in south west Las Vegas. I always go to the Durango location and always leave full and satisfied. Sometimes I go in a rush and the service is so fast that you can literally be in and out. Sometimes it not and still enjoy a nice long breakfast with friends their pancakes are huge and the service is always so nice and friendly!! Make sure to go there if you want an amazing breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Awesome. These guys are great. I come in before work and they make my breakfast extremely fast and its always the same high quality delicious food. Prices are also reasonable and their OJ is fresh squeezed and my favorite. Reminds me of Europe, just without the Nutella (although I'm sure they have it if you want it)"}
{"text":"Good belly filling food. Pancake oversized, good flavor but a little tough. Orange juice full of pulp and yummy. The gravy was homemade and the potatoes had skins on, crisp on outside, tender inside. The highlight here was the sausage patty and eggs!  

I'll be back to try the more outrageous breakfast items that made them famous."}
{"text":"My friend took me here during our weekend visit to Vegas. It's about a 15 minute drive from the strip and it's worth it! 

This family owned restaurant is absolutely adorable. The staff are so friendly and they make you feel right at home. 

Now let's talk about the food. My friend ordered the red velvet pancakes (which is the purpose of the trip to this restaurant according to them). I had the egg whites and turkey sausage with potatoes.  

Now let me first say that I'm not a big breakfast person. Just give me a good cup of joe and I'm good. But the breakfast at this place is delicious! Those red velvet pancakes melted in my mouth.  All of the other food was yummy too. 

I definitely see why my friend makes a special trip to Stacks and Yolks when visiting Vegas. 

Mmm hmm...I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has much improved since we went last year! We were early Sunday morning regulars but the place started lacking so we lost interest. 

There's MORE staff. The current people today we're happy and attentive! There's an updated menu in an easy to read fashion. They still have their 10 pancakes and 10 egg challenge. They've updated the interior decor which is rustic and cool. There's MORE seating outside to accompany the long lines with a hostess stand. The hot chocolate was piled high with whipped cream, cinnamon and cho sauce and I regretted not ordering one. 

I did try the marinated beef tips which were marinated for 18hours in unicorn tears. LOL literally. The tips were too overdone for me but my husband loved the dish. It came with a biscuit and gravy which was FANTASTIC. I would add some sausage chunks to this though. We also got the chicken and waffles and that was tender and perfect. The orange juice has a lot of pulp, just the way I like it! 

I think we would become regulars again based on today's experience."}
{"text":"Every time I'm here I'm blown away by the staff and the food. They are so helpful and fun. If you get the owner (Baha) to wait on you, you'll never have a dull moment. You can tell the staff love their job for just how they treat you. The food is made with love or in their terms...unicorn tears. Hahaha great for families or even just friends. The best part of it all...they now carry red bull!!!! I'm all about that liquid crack and now I can have one when I'm here :) you won't regret it,come in and try everything"}
{"text":"We were the only customers on a Monday afternoon.  I had pumpkin pancakes, eggs, sausage, bacon and ham.  The pancakes are HUGE so keep that in mind when you order a stack.  You may only need one or two pancakes...any more may go to waste.  The food will fill you up.  The waiter was very polite and accommodating.  He came to check on us several times and kept the coffee and water cups full.  I would definitely come back and visit when I am in town again."}
{"text":"Came in, wait wasn't bad. Took awhile to be sat and saw a waitress argue with a customer about how cold their sandwich was. From my distance, I could see it was cold. Ordered the pork chop (special) and a cup of coffee. It took them about 30 min to get the order out and I went without a refill of coffee for about 24min. No one checked up on it. Porkchop was greasy and bland, gravy had no flavor, and it looks like it may have sat for awhile before being brought out. This is definitely one of the worst places of which I have eaten. Avoid it. 

Also noticed that staff doesn't pre-bus and let plates sit for those that linger. Don't check up and just an overall bad experience."}
{"text":"The food is very very very good. The service can be kind of up and down, sometimes you get really nice people and sometimes you can tell they really don't want to be there BUT the food is truly good. I would still recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this morning. The food was delicious. The staff was friendly. However... Make sure you have the $$$$$ for this place. Especially if you are going to make a change to your order. $35 for breakfast for two.  I ordered their artichoke omelette special (delicious). It had mushrooms in it and I requested to have them taken out and add ham. Well they did at a high cost. $1.00 to remove the mushrooms and $4.00 to add ham (not very much either). While I understand charging to add things I don't understand charging to remove. Wouldn't have had a huge problem with it (maybe the $4 for ham) had they mentioned it prior to handing us the bill. Will likely return but will know better then to request any personalization to the food."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place for breakfast and this place did not disappoint. Our host/waiter, Gavin, was great. He was not overbearing and very personable and attentive. The food looked like it did in the menu and tasted delicious. We both ordered the steak tips, with 3 eggs and potatoes. We also added lemon blueberry pancakes . Everything was delicious,  including the orange juice. Love this place and will absolutely be back...great service, great food, and great time"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places in Vegas. The staff is great and the menu has plenty of options. I will however suggest ordering two different drinks, because your water glass is going to sit there empty for a while ?"}
{"text":"Average food, great service, BUT we waited forever for our food because of the cooks. We got there at 10:30. We were sat within 10 minutes. But we didn't get our food until about 11:30. When it did come out, the server brought out each item as it came out. I ate a side of bacon and was still waiting for the rest of my food for about 15 minutes. They have churro waffles and churro French toast. The churro French toast was amazing and almost worth the wait. If you go I would err on the side of caution and give yourself enough time to wait for your food."}
{"text":"My husband and I looove this place! The staff is awesome:) Everyone is so friendly! We go here almost every weekend. The food is so good. They have a large variety of specialty pancakes and delicious fresh squeezed orange juice. You have to try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday morning and there were just 2 tables that were occupied.   They took our order right away.  I ordered a short stack of red velvet pancakes with strawberries and my husband ordered the breakfast burrito.  We got our food fast. The red velvet pancakes were really fluffy and delicious.  My husband's burrito were just ok, nothing really special about it.  While we were eating it got busier.   The reason why I'm giving them a 3.5 stars was for the time we waited for our check to come after I asked for it.  I saw customers  that were getting a little miffed while waiting for their food.  I still want to patronize them because they are not a chain."}
{"text":"Best meat lovers skillet in Vegas. Believe me, I am a breakfast lover and the meat lover is my breakfast. I've tried them all... cracked egg. Baby cakes. Egg and i. All very good. This is the best. Haven't tried their meatless skillet. (Dennys fit fare skillet is hands down, no competition best veggie skillet)."}
{"text":"I came here before, was not happy with food and especially service reps. My daughter me back today, I was so happy to see upgrades and the pancake was excellent,  and Gavin excellent service he a keeper he makes the place. Will be back and tell family and friends."}
{"text":"Its pretty pricey, rushed, and cramped for a breakfast spot. I felt awkward and bad trying to figure out how to get to the disabled seating alone, but then again, an actual disabled person would have had a much harder time and even the staff were having trouble maneuvering.
It was loud enough that I actually couldn't get my order through to the waiter (Veggie Benedict got confused to Veggie Skillet) and my poached eggs were overdone, but the food was still good. I'll know what to expect when I order the Benedict next time. 
I really liked their pancakes, a single stack was enough for two on top of the meal."}
{"text":"I had all the hope in the world for this cute restaurant.

I originally came here for the first time with a friend about two months ago. The service was terrible (the way of being seated, our waitress, and not getting our bill and check back after we paid) but the food was stellar (french toast, sausage, and cheesy scrambled eggs). Since the food was stellar, I decided to give this cute breakfast place another chance. What a mistake. The way of being seated, which consists of waiting outside where there is no greeter, but instead a waiter or waitress who happens to be outside, makes no sense to me. Thank goodness a waiter happened to be outside or we would've been standing out on a humid day for awhile. The restaurant was practically empty. We chose one of the two booths in the back of the restaurant, which was freezing compared to the rest of the restaurant. I ordered a hot tea, and my cup still had a ring of coffee or tea from the last person who drank from the cup.. Absolutely repulsive. The waitress nonchalantly gave me another cup as if the fact the cup was dirty wasn't that big of a deal. I ordered the french toast again that I had last time, while my friend ordered chicken fingers. My friend said her chicken tenders tasted rubbery and she wasn't even sure if it was chicken. My french toast wasn't close to the quality it was the first time I visited this restaurant. 

I gave this restaurant that has rave reviews on Yelp two chances and was unsatisfied both times, I definitely won't be back for lucky number three. I'll go to SkinnyFats instead."}
{"text":"I'm still parked in front of the store. I feel it's my duty to warn EVERYONE else! The service here is GREAT! The food is absolutely HORRIBLE! First I ordered their \"marinated in unicorn tears\" steak. Hmm... I didn't think unicorn tears tasted like pure garlic! WAY TOO MUCH GARLIC FOR BREAKFAST! It came with breakfast potatoes and A biscuit and gravy. Again the potatoes were horrible. They were burnt on one side and under cooked on the other and very greasy. Last was the biscuit and gravy. Again very bad. The biscuit tasted like it was stale and microwaved. The gravy taste kind of like soap. I did not want to send it back because I don't like doing that but the waitress was really friendly and she wanted to give the cook a second chance. 
So, I ordered the buttermilk pancakes. How bad could their pancakes be? Name of the place is stacks and yolks... It was very bad! I I could barely cut it with the knife they gave me. Is very tough and it didn't taste good. It was absolutely covered in powdered sugar so much that it poured off and got all over the table. I hope they weren't trying to hide something in the powdered sugar. That's why I hate sending things back.  I really regret wasting my time and money coming here."}
{"text":"What can i saw about this place that already hasn't ? Line our the door, the owner is awesome and the food is fantastic. You how you run a good shop? When people choose not to wait due to a long line and ultimately regret it because your food is so damn delicious. 
This is by far one of the best \"off the strip\" breakfast spots in town."}
{"text":"Been here once before and thought we would go today since we liked it the first time.  They only took drink orders from my husband, daughter and myself but not my mom. My mom's fork was dirty so I had to ask our server for a clean one.  I was pretty disappointed.  May be they were just short staffed today... and my biscuit and gravy was cold."}
{"text":"It was okay.  My husband ordered the crab cake Benedict and it was alright. The crab cake was decent, but the egg was over poached. When you think Benedict you think a nice poached egg where the yolks runs out. It was cooked . 

I ordered the oatmeal with Granola berry topping. Again it was okay. It wasn't amazing or anything extraordinary, something you can make at home. 

Service was fine. The staff is friendly. two things for me the irked me was that my husbands entree came way before mine. Probably waited a good 5 minutes by the time he got his to when I got mine. If I had ordered something complex I would understand the wait, but I literally just got oatmeal, topped with granola and chopped berries.  

Also both bathroom doors are broken! That was probably the most annoying. I mean common fix your bathroom doors! At least one of them."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, food was great! Our server Lexy had just the right amount of sassy. Great place!

Had the Gobbler scramble, was perfect. They have people all around ready to serve at a moment's notice.

My buddy had the \"lips\" and it was crazy awesome looking."}
{"text":"We started off waiting for 20 minutes. And plus the hostess skipped us. We got inside and the restaurant layout is too crowded and too small. Third they got my drink wrong. The food was good. Nothing too special. Its better to enjoy if ordered takeout tho. Fourth the waiter did not even check on us. We had to get his attention for a refill. Overall not a good experience."}
{"text":"So I ended my post too early. After all the trouble, embarrassment and terrible service there was no type of accommodation what so ever. Now I never asked for a discount or free food but I've never ever been so upset about service. I will eat at mcdonalds before come back here. Who am I kidding I'll never come back."}
{"text":"If you like to wait around for 30 minutes to get your food, come here. I ordered some food, waited 25 minutes and finally got it. While I was waiting, I out in a to go order for my wife and sat around for over 30 minutes. I finally wales up and said, I'll give you 2 minutes to finish my order or I'm leaving and they said it would be another 5 minutes. My wife is at the hospital waiting for her food but she was in pain so she told me to forgot the food and just come back. 35 minute from order to divert of food at a breakfast place with no warning is crazy."}
{"text":"Great food great value! The apple cinnamon pancakes were delicious! The atmosphere was fun. Very personable staff."}
{"text":"Saturday May 6, 2017 at 7am, opening up, the server is freaking SLAMMED!  This place is packed and he's by himself.  This is the first server, waiter, busser I've ever seen in my short lifetime.  He's running around, dodging the corners of tables, balancing plates, zipping by, he's very nice and welcoming, sweating, doing the register, omfg it's crazy.  He did a great job.  couldn't get his name.  He's a bald gentlemen.  He's the only reason for the rating.  Give this man a raise!

Okay the food was great, I just felt some dishes like the carne asada skillet was a few bucks overpriced.  I'll come back for the food.  I just hope the waiter is here again"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The one thing I didn't like was the man that was sending the food out was handling food and money at the same time without gloves."}
{"text":"It's a shame this place has so much potential it just is going down week by week the food is just ok doesn't really have the real taste anymore .And come on clean those windows they're filthy tables  ,the seats, and the bathrooms filthy and the girls have attitudes I will never go back there again I should have went to Dunkin Donuts ."}
{"text":"We had seen positive comments from friends and decided to check it out.  We were disappointed.   With a name of \"Stacks and Yolks\", you'd expect the pancakes to be light, fluffy and melt in your mouth.  I ordered the lemon blueberry and they wouldn't cut with a fork.  The flavor was good but they were rubbery and tough.  The eggs were ordered over easy but it is generous to say they were over medium. You get a choice of toast or biscuits and gravy with egg entrees.  The gravy tasted like the flour base, not like the sausage that it should have and the biscuit was doughy. The corned beef hash didn't have any flavor."}
{"text":"There is a reason that the ratings have been so low recently. I went for breakfast with my coworkers here and the only thing that was halfway decent was the skillet my coworker got. Everything else was extremely bland. Coffee was weak. Hollandaise seemed canned. Server was friendly."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a few times and can recommend the pancakes, however i do not recommend bacon, eggs, hash browns, your typical  breakfast. They  are luke warm and tasted like they had been reheated. The service is confusing,  we had one person take our order, a different person bring our food, another different person bring our check and another person serve our coffee. The original waiter never came back to our table. I wont be returning."}
{"text":"Was our first time here yesterday. It was highly recommended by a coworker. I got the ABC Skillet and it was one of the best breakfast things I've ever had. My girlfriend got the meat lovers scrambler and said her food was on the bland side so she had to salt a pepper it to even eat it. I tried it and agree it was kind of bland. We also got a single lips pancake that was really good. It was a red velvet pancake with icing/syrup and strawberries. 

My complaint was the water they served tasted like the filled the pitcher up at the tap. This is a big turn off since I only drink water. If this wasn't the case I would've given it 5 stars based off the awesome meal I had. 

We'll try it again in a month or two to see if it's gotten better. The place has really good potential."}
{"text":"Today I had breakfast and it was super busy! The staff was so awesome and smiling even through the rush. Our server was Brandon, he was covering two sections and still kept his cool, even was able to spar with me while under such pressure of dealing with so many hangry people! I loved my food just as much as the service. Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Although the food is really great here , I have to give only 3 stars. The wait time and organization on the table list needs attention, as well some features through out the restaurant . Service is friendly and doing the best that they can with what they have to work with."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood spot. I love the turkey gobbler skillet. It comes with potatoes and toast. The service is friendly and atmosphere is fun and vibrant. The pancakes are delicious- especially the red velvet but I suggest sharing. It's a big serving. Get there early on weekends."}
{"text":"So after visting their booth at the foodie fest this year me and my boyfriend had to visit their actual restaurant!

We went on a Sat for brunch and the place was PACKED!! We waited about 10 or 15 mins for a table (not bad at all). While waiting we looked at the menu so we could order as soon as we were seated (we were STARVING).

I ordered the DEEP FRIED CHURRO FRENCH TOAST!!!! OMG!!! I freaking ate the entire thing! It was crispy on the outside but moist and soft on the inside! The sugars on the French Toast stuck so well to it, i didnt have to scrap any thing off my plate. 

Since then, ive tried to recreate this dish at home and have FAILED so I will be returning back for the french toast!"}
{"text":"The only thing we order there are the pancakes, all their protiens leave much to be desired. The service is always bad. This time, to my surprise, it wasn't bad and the young hostess was very caring and attentive"}
{"text":"This place is run by zombies....they had one waitress with obviously no experience or no competence to multi-task..(we were ready to pay and when she was walking toward us she deliberately avoided eye contact after we were calling her to pick up the check) The manager took our order, we waited about 15 min for Crab Cake Benedict and a short stack as there was only one cook. The manager deposited our food on the table and abruptly walked away without asking if we needed anything....like SYRUP! The food....crab cake tasted like fish sticks, I agree Hollandaise sauce was tasteless....Kind of blah food really. I would rather go to Hash House a Go Go.
Boo."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go to breakfast in all of Las Vegas! From the great staff and owner. To the great food. To the local celebrity siting. This is the spot.

Menu faves: Steak tips \"marinated in unicorn tears\" and eggs, Arizona Skillet, chorizo scramble, I love the specialty pancakes.... they come up with some great seasonal ones too...

Now I am hungry.... guess I am going for breakfast now..."}
{"text":"I've had breakfast here many times. I usually come for their French toast and the eggs Benedict. I like to get the traditional Benedict and add spinach and tomatoes to it. Their red velvet pancakes and skillets are also very good. For lunch I would recommend the chicken pesto melt."}
{"text":"Impossible to give this small spot a bad a review. You are not only won over by the taste and smell of the food but also by the exceptional customer service. Regardless of if its your waitress or not they are all attentive and take the time ask if you need anything.  As soon as I walked in I was greeted by Juanis and taken to a table where I was told that I chose a good time to come since they were \"slow\". I thought she was kidding as every table was taken including the ones outside and more people came in behind me but she said that there was always a constant line. In the 45 mins that I have been here I see what  she meant. I have seen kids, seniors, and young adults. Business people and people just enjoying the morning. The ambiance is very friendly and almost as if u were at a friends house dinner party. 

The fact that I asked Juanis to make me whatever she wanted, and without even blink asked how I liked my eggs and if I wanted pancakes, was pretty cool. She then proceeded to go consult with another waitress and came back to say \" okay it will be out shortly.\" Next thing I knew I was brought three plates, one biscuit and gravy (that was amazingly and perfectly flavored) one philly steak skillet, and one side of a red velvet pancake with cream cheese and strawberries on top (not usually a fan of red velvet anything but after trying this pancakes I'm tempted to come here and just order this pancakes. They were moist, not very sweet, and the strawberries tasted fresh.) 
And the whole time my cup of coffee was kept full and fresh. Now being Colombian, its hard for me to find a coffee that I enjoy drinking black, this coffee is definitely the exception. I've had 3 cups and still continue to drink it black as its that good. 
 The philly was... Omg delicious. Seasoned to perfection, just the right amount of potatoes, steak, onion, and eggs. For $12.00 the portion is perfect and the experience this place gives is very exceptional. I will definitely be back and hope that this experience is consistent. :-)"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 2 and half stars if I could, but since there's no option for that I'll continue on to the review. My first impression of this place was ok, I thought the service of seating was a little weird. I didn't like where you had the host table outside, but with no one to greet you. But hey no biggie, perhaps there was a hostess inside that would come to our service. Wrong, it was more of like a hello please wait there.....kind of leaves no point of having a greeting table outside with no one there to greet you. Ok, on to the next issue. This place seemed a little crammed for seating. We literally sat right next to the cash register with a bit of traffic movement. You have waiters and people paying constantly, it's kind of hard to enjoy a meal if you're constantly being bothered by other guests. But hey, it's a family style breakfast joint so whatever. 

On to the menu, I already knew what to get at this point so I waited patiently for my server. After taking my order, 10 mins later I am notified that the crab egg benedict was out for the day. I kind of scratched my head in confusion since the store just opened literally an hour ago. Ok, no biggie I revised my order and get a regular eggs benedict with bacon as a side. My bf got the marinated steak tips, which was kind of pricy but hey we live a little and splurged. 

After ordering, our food was delivered in 15 mins which was quite fast. I was honestly disappointed in my food, the eggs Benedict was greasy and the bacon was burnt. My bf said his steak tasted like an underrated Filipino BBQ stick that you could get at seafood city lol. Yes, he can be brutal. I couldn't concentrate on eating my food since a fly kept buzzing around my head constantly bothering me.

Don't think I'd be returning to this place again, wasn't too impressed with the food. But hey that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"I thought we would try a different breakfast place since I've seen this place on Instagram and all the food looked delicious. I was very wrong. The eggs and bacon were cold the pancakes were like rubber. We were missing part of our food and when we asked for it to be removed from our check they said they couldn't because its part of the meal so it's one price. They could have offered something. Over crowded and understaffed. Servers running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Not worth the long wait."}
{"text":"The pumpkin pancakes were amazing as was the customer service.  

I'm giving three stars because the chairs and tables need to be replaced (very old and beat up) and all of our toast/English muffins were under done."}
{"text":"Went with great expectations and was disappointed with my selection \"lobster curry\" portion was small, not presented well and below average flavors for a curry"}
{"text":"First time here... I know, where have I been... Can I say Great Service ...Great Food & Options... Will Happily Return plus #ChurroWaffle Mind Blown"}
{"text":"This place is just around the corner so we gave it a try on a Sunday morning. It was busy but we were sat right away at an outside table. The coffee was thin and weak, which is very disappointing for breakfast. Hubby wanted hot tea but all they had was Lipton tea bags. I ordered Eggs Benedict Florentine. It was OK. I decided I had to try a Pancake since everyone seems to gush over their selection. I ordered the Lemon Blueberry and the server asked if I would like fresh Blueberries on top. It sounded lovely, so I agreed. Wow. What a disappointment. The Pancake arrived with CANNED Blueberries...you know, the little shriveled up kind that are usually added to boxed pancake mixes. It also was lacking any Lemon flavor. Hubby ordered a meat scramble that he said was OK. All in all, I have no desire to return. I know there are plenty of other choices for breakfast in this amazing city!!"}
{"text":"I'd like to say I was able to review the food but we arrived at 2:38 on a Saturday and they turned us away because they closed at 3.  We had a group of 10 and would've been good business. Bad customer service. The employees said they already had everything clean and refused to serve us!!!"}
{"text":"Stacks and yolks is a decent breakfast place but they lack attention to detail. Their red velvet pancake is smothered with Hershey's strawberry and chocolate syrup. Unfortunately that is all you can taste when eating it. Wish they used more homemade topping instead of high fructose syrups. Decent place for breakfast but not up to par with some of my faves."}
{"text":"Great food and service always friendly. Did update so has cool vide with colorful wood walls. Waiters have cute shirts (no decaf ever! Lol)"}
{"text":"Be prepared to spend a little more for a huge portion. I definitely recommend sharing a plate instead of ordering your own.  Food was mediocre and overpriced for the lack of quality. I am not too crazy about some bugs flying around our food, very irritating. Service was awesome though. They know how to hire servers with personality. If you are looking for a social place to grab run of the mill American brunch food then come here. If you are a foodie like me go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Server was friendly! Food was ok my egg were over cook on my Carb Cake Benny and paid a dollar extra fruit and half of it was rotten which is not ok with me."}
{"text":"If I could, I would give it a 3.5 stars. Service is great. Had the meat lovers scramble. It was alright. The bacon they use is kinda bland to me though. And the water tastes kind weird. I did really enjoy the biscuits and gravy. I would come back, but not too often."}
{"text":"I have to say, I loved the food. Besides the biscuits and gravy, does any one in this town know how to make a good gravy?  The biscuit was really good too, I can see there made from scratch. My wife and I ordered the Veggie skillets. Really good cooked well three eggs on top. Nice
 The problem I see and others on Yelp are complaining about is the service. I hate waiting for a refill on my coffee. That should be a gimme in and breakfast place. Then there just wasn't happiness in this place. They seem to be missable working there. No welcoming, no thanks for coming. What I recommend, Is this your first time to Stacks and Yokes?  This is important to any small business to get right. I just felt here's your food, here's your check and only one refill on my coffee
 I bring up the coffee issue because that's how I judge service. If I get at least three refills my coffee there on it, if I say I've had enough coffee. There getting a good tip. When I only get on refill. Forget it. No matter how good the food is there going to loose on the there tip. Just shows me how the service is. 
Last but not least. It felt sticky in there also. Wipe your kids higher chair down, and your tables better."}
{"text":"Lumber jack- Eggs hard, french toast nothing special, bacon good hashrowns undercooked. Meatlovers skillet - seemed like one egg, sausage should have been on a pizza not in a breakfast meal, home fries ordered crispy were good, buscuit gravy plain and didn't have good texture. Sadly disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is good, great variety. Customer service is poor.  Need nicer wait staff in the morning. 
Wait staff bad attitude on the am"}
{"text":"I really wanted to try Babycakes this morning for their Red Velvet pancakes, but we overslept and by the time we got ready and out the door - there was no way we could wait 40 minutes in line and drive across town.  So we went to The Griddle down the street.

We were welcomed and seated right away and no 40 minute wait. 

I obviously ordered the Short Stack Red Velvet Pancakes with (2) over medium eggs and (2) patty sausages combo. I ended up getting 3 eggs and 1 patty sausage, but considering I didn't finish everything, it didn't bother me.  They offered me several different meat options (bacon, link sausage, patty sausage and Portuguese sausage)  and the menu only listed link sausage and bacon. I have never had Red Velvet pancakes, so I have nothing to compare them to, but I was a fan. But you can't go wrong with fresh strawberries, chocolate sauce and red velvet.
The boyfriend ordered the Meat Lovers plate or something, it wasn't really a omelette or a skillet. He said it was really good, and it had his favorite biscuits and gravy. He made a blissed out face when I asked him if they were good or not, which I take as a yes. 

We had 3 different staff members help us, the hostess and drink taker seemed like the mother of the owner, a younger guy who was our waiter and another guy who joked around and brought us our food who I think was the owner. 'Mom' seemed sad that I ordered cranberry juice and not the fresh squeezed orange juice - I hope she hadn't been squeezing oranges all morning in the back! 

I saw some grimy kid fingers on the painting behind us, but other than that it was clean. I wasn't offended by anything, and nothing but the grimy hand prints (that only can be seen from certain angles) stuck out at me,"}
{"text":"I started coming here because it's just up the road from my house and I'm happy to go back there any time.

Pros: The pancakes/waffles/french toast are incredible and quite perfect in every way.  I find the owner/manager to be quite nice.

Cons: The other breakfast items (eggs, potatoes, etc) are fair.  The coffee is downright bad. 

Tip: Just get up and go to the counter when you're ready to pay otherwise you could be there a while."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Service left something to improve on next time. Would go back. Pancakes are their specialty and worth the time."}
{"text":"Ok this really sucks to have to do this but yet again my order was horrible! This place is awesome 50% of the time but I'm sorry- for these prices & the simplicity of the dishes - the order should be perfect!
Today is by far the worst it's been yet - everything is either undercooked or overcooked! Needless to say we won't be ordering from here anymore - such a shame"}
{"text":"Let me start by writing that no one can ever cook my French toast right smh..... This place nailed it :) I mean from my scrambled eggs to my bacon.... everything was cooked perfect. My husband ordered an omelette that came with potatoes and eggs... soooo good. We will definitely be back. On  top of everything service was great! You guys are awesome I don't mind spending my bucks we're service is great and food taste so good. Thanks."}
{"text":"Wow I'm so disappointed. We have been here one other time and enjoyed our experience but today was horrible. Our waiter, the guy with black hair, arm tattoos and gauges was not paying attention when we gave him our orders. He got the pancakes wrong, and after asking multiple times for syrup for said pancakes, we had to ask their busgirl to get it. Then we went to pay and the gentleman who I believe was the owner was rude and basically threw our money around. 

The food is good but today the service was very disappointing. I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I always go to stack and yolks every other Sunday for a few months now!!! For all those times, service and food is good. But not today :( food is still excellent though, but service was a zero!!! Our server was a slob. I'm not against him for his weight. But his attitude. He never greeted us, just went to our table and ask us what we want to eat. No hi no hello. Since it's such a small place and was crowded, there is really no place to move around. While he was cleaning the other table, his big fat ass is on my face!!! Added to that, his phone on his back pocket is ringing loudly!!! Never once he came back to our table ask us what else we need!!! I'll come back this place again, one last chance the Sunday after next. If ever i get this guy as a server again, that would be my last time eating here."}
{"text":"Yeah, it was good, but for the price I find it expensive, they would have earned an extra star if their prices were a few dollers cheaper, and yes just like the previous yelper mentioned he thought one of the waitress's was absoultly stunning, and belive me she is! You can't miss her!,,Would i go back? Maybe but not for awhile as there are too many other breakfast joints here in Vegas that are just as good but cheaper."}
{"text":"This a small and busy restaurant. We ordered the Elvis pancakes and the Arizona skillet. The skillet was bland, which is hard to do with jalapeños as an ingredient, and the eggs (which were ordered poach) came hard boiled. 
The pancakes initially tasted ok. The problem came when I found a soft 4-5 inch blonde hair in my food. I showed it to the waitress and was immediately told it had to be mine- my hair is long, coarse from bleaching, and white blonde. The waitress insisted it couldn't be the staff's because no one cooking had blonde hair. Meanwhile, I watched the manager/owner (? ) slinging her hair around as she cooked the food. 
If I had been approached with \"I'm sorry, let me replace (or get you something else)\" instead of an accusation I would have been way more forgiving. 
I usually give a bad experience a second chance but I'm not sure about this place."}
{"text":"Ordered a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich...ended up with two plates which weren't my order and he told me to take both. . I tell the guy and he says, just have these? Get home....bacon is so spice I can't even eat it.  Don't think I'd order from here again."}
{"text":"All I can remember is that the food and service was terrible. And keep in mind, ordering for about 8 different people and none of it being that great? Slap on some sugar and syrups all you want... But basic as can be."}
{"text":"This morning, I came here with a friend after helping another friend pack to move to NY. The service was amazing!!! We had three different servers come to our table asking for drink refills or if we needed anything. The servers were also hilarious, making up jokes as we ordered food. The location is easy to get to as it is right off the 215. The food was phenominal. I had ordered chicken and waffles per recommendation of my friend. To my surprise, it was superb. The chicken was cooked perfectly, not burned or dry. The flavor of the waffle was great too! It wasnt too sugary.  If you are looking for a quick and flavorful breakfast, you should check this place out. The price for the breakfast is average compared to other breakfast joints in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"Stacks & Yolks..... stick to the Stacks... get it... Hahaha
Okay that was corny but really, the stacks are great! They have the best pancakes! The best! They have a huge selection of flavored batters and toppings. My favorite are just the plain old buttermilk with the whipped butter and good old fashioned maple syrup. Delicious!
I do hate that the don't have fresh blueberry pancakes though. Only compost :(
The Three Egg Skillet was not good at all, greasy, not cooked well, the potatoes needed to be crisped up, greasy and not crispy? it was bad. Didn't like their toast, or bacon either, quality was not there at all.
Like I said..... Stick to the Stacks!"}
{"text":"I've made two trips to this establishment.  My first visit was excellent.  The food was delicious, the service was great and our server was friendly.  I had the churro French toast, the steak marinated in unicorn tears and the fresh squeezed orange juice.  

After posting a photo of my food on social media, the owner(I assume) commented on my photo and said my next stack was on the house.  

My second trip was not the same experience.  Our server was rude and made it obvious she wanted to go home.  We felt rushed the entire time and unfortunately they were out of toast and gravy for our biscuit.  

I tried the veggie scramble and the mint chocolate chip stack or \"The Smitty.\" The scramble and pancakes both tasted great.  

However, when I showed our server the message for the free stack she stated, oh, I don't know how to do that, I just can't give you free pancakes.  

After this second experience, it may be a while before I go back to this location."}
{"text":"We recently moved across the street and I noticed this place because of the name. I've passed it 100 times but never ventured in. On moving morning we ordered to go, Country combo was great. Person I spoke with on the phone was very friendly and it was ready in less than 10 minutes. We'll be back in the future to see what dining in is like."}
{"text":"Great vibes, good food. Quick and delicious. It's everything you want out of a good breakfast cafe. Staff is onto of it always, and everyone is smiling and having a good time. Great place for a quick breakfast bite!"}
{"text":"Place smelt bad from the moment we walked in. Guess that should've been a sign. Traditional Benedict and crab cake Benedict was awful. Only had a few bites and my stomach started to hurt."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend. Got their special, which was Biscuits and Gravy. Food was great. their Red Velvet pancakes weren't the best, however their buttermilk is. Service was great. The only downfall was the seating. Kinda crowded, and seats were very close to the table next to you

I will go back as it was well worth the price and the quality was spot on"}
{"text":"My husband and I went out for a late breakfast, and I have to say I am beyond happy! I have to honestly say this is the first time in my adult life that I've gone to a restaurant and every single thing that I ordered right down to the coffee was amazing! The service was magnificent Kate, Jess and Lydia were killin it with them team work thing! For the record I had coffee fresh squeezed orange juice,spinach feta omelette fruit and a peanut butter pancake, that was to die for! Thanks ladies and who's ever in the kitchen, we will definitely be back often! Rhonda (North Paws Ranch)"}
{"text":"Food is good services for serving was okay But the kitchen was extremely very extremely slow and preparing several people walked out"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have never written a \"negative\" yelp.  I only try to boost good businesses, but this place was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO horrible I had to post something.  DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES EAT AT THIS DUMP!

I stopped in for a weekend breakfast while I was running errands.  The help was fine, but the place was filthy and I'm not a neat freak. There were enough crumbs on the seat of the booth to make a piece of toast.  We were wedged between the bathroom and a cart that was so overflowing with dirty dishes they were falling on the floor and it wasn't even busy.

 I ordered a waffle.  One would thing that's pretty basic.  It was so tough and rubbery it was  inedible.  It was topped with a handful of MARGARINE.  The Iced Tea tasted like it was instant..  I asked for the eggs soft and they were literally raw.  The sausage was thin, tough and almost burnt.  The person I was with got one of their \"specialties\".  It ended up being worse than a microwaved burrito from Rebel!

The entire restaurant was full of unhappy people and the manager/owner was walking around completely oblivious.  The table next to us hit the nail on the head.  \"They must of called this place The Griddle because  \"The Microwave\" was already taken.

There are so many great breakfast places in town (Sunrise Cafe and Cracked Egg to name 2) please don't ever patronize this dump.  Great restaurants are one's that take pride in what they do.  This place should be ashamed to be open.  And to top it off $30 for 2 people so pretty pricey."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Went there 2/4/18 for breakfast with some friends. Had to wait @20 minutes and it was worth the wait. I had the chicken wings and waffles and it was seasoned perfectly. My husband had one of the skillets and killed it. I definitely recommend them. Very good fresh made orange juice."}
{"text":"Food is alright, but you better set aside half of your day if you want to eat here. After waiting for 45 minutes for a table, food took another hour and then it took 30 minutes after finishing our breakfast to get our check. We had to flag down the hostess for drink refills and to take out credit card at the end.

The pros were that they do offer gluten free pancakes and waffles. I tried a Waffle which was just okay.. But it was nice to have GF option either way. Also, the fresh squeezed Oj was really good. The hostess and waiter were very friendly.. But I don't see myself coming back.. The wait was just ridiculous."}
{"text":"I just had an unpleasant experience. We had eaten here once before and it was okay, although the service wasn't great. We thought the jalapeño bacon was good last time.. Today, I ordered a BLT with the jalapeño bacon again. I took two bites of the sandwich and wound up with a slimy piece of bacon in my mouth that tasted and looked and felt raw in my mouth. I totally lost my appetite and didn't eat another bite. The server never came around after serving our food, probably because it was New Year's Day and very busy--although the same thing happened last time when no other customers were there. I would have sent it back, but never had the opportunity. Since we never got our check from our server, we went to the counter to ask for our bill. I told the man behind the register, who must be some kind of manager because he was the only one without a uniform, and he gave me $2.95 off--and a snarky comment about how all their bacon is precooked. I am completely disgusted and insulted. I just paid $7 for the side salad, I guess. He should have saved the cynical side eye and discounted the actual price of the inedible meal. I won't be going back back after feeling ripped off by the greedy so & so behind the counter."}
{"text":"First time be here. The food is ok, but it took 30mins for us to get our food set on the table. Ordered arizona skillets, and they forgot my eggs. The lady brought back my eggs, and there were only two( supposed to be 3). I didn't say anything because I couldn't eat 3 eggs anyway, not even 2. Now, I am waiting for the bill, which I asked 10 minutes ago, and its seems like they forgot about the bill again."}
{"text":"Great place for pancakes. 
Checked this place out with a friend for the first time today and I really like it. 
4 stars for service, prompt, attentive, and most of all friendly. From the host, servers and the busers.
Minus 1 star for seating arrangement. We were quite close to the ordering station where there was a lot of foot traffic, but that really didn't bother us, but it could for those who are \"claustrophobic\". Just saying. 
For my first time I wanted pancakes.
BTW... If you're a light eater 1 stack is seriously just enough just add ur eggs n bacon.
Build your own: 1 stack (3.99) ur choice of batter, I chose Buttermilk for simplicity. Added toppings ur choice, I chose Blueberries for antioxidants and anti aging ;) (1.00)
I upgraded my order with 2 eggs and 2 bacon (2.99) 
All worth it!
I'd like to continue coming here and try something different with every visit. 
They have so much more to choose from for breakfast and lunch. 
Check out their menu.
Forget IHOP, this is now my go to house of pancakes.

YUM!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!! Food NEVER comes out at the same time!!!! Saddest part is the consistently gone the kids meal last!!!!!   We are all done with our Breakfast and my grandson is just getting his meal.... after having to asks the waitstaff THREE times!!!!!  Shame  on you!!!!   I am extremely disappointed since it is my daughter's birthday!!!"}
{"text":"I am very picky about my breakfast and this place just didn't meet my expectations! The pancakes were just so-so. I love the concept of being able to choose your batter and toppings and etc. but the execution was not to my taste. Syrup is half the battle and it was watery and really had no flavor. Always November had a delicious cream cheese whip on top but pancake itself was a little underdone and lacked the flavor punch I seek. My mother-in-law didn't care much for the gluten-free pancakes, she said they had an overwhelming almond flavor. The protein pancakes looked like it was mostly eggs and didn't really taste like a pancake. Kids loved the chocolate chip pancakes though, but what kid wouldn't?! Sweet server and good (but overpriced) fresh squeezed OJ, but since I'm all about the food I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"So packed and busy. Slow service and food was ok. 

They have a few tables outside, host station is outside so when you're waiting for your table you have to stay outside. Would definitely not recommend coming here when it's cold outside.

Inside, they have packed their sitting so it's so cramped. When it's crowded good luck trying to move around. You literally feel like you are sitting with strangers and having breakfast.

Service was horrible. Each person that came to our table said it was their first week so they apologized for their service not being up to par. Each persons food came at a different time, food order was wrong, when asking for condiments they forgot to bring them, didn't ask to refill water or coffee. 

Food was ok so that's the only reason I have them 2 stars. 

There are so many other breakfast places so I would recommend going to one of those."}
{"text":"Amazing Pancakes  huge servings and just makes me a happy person after I fuel up at stacks n yolks. Highly recommended for anyone that is a pancake lover ."}
{"text":"Went to eat at stacks and yolks on 821 2017 and haven't been in there since it was griddle cakes the service was great but the food wasn't so great the potatoes tasted like they weren't even cooked like they were Raw and the ask for true over medium egg and got something far from that and they increase the prices on almost everything on there and then"}
{"text":"I first want to start off by saying that I am a manager at a restaurant. Where we have values and commitments to our customers to insure they are satisfied to their own liking. 

First we were quoted 20 mins and ended up waiting 25-30 mins, no big deal. 
Second we waited 10mins+ from the time we were sat till our initial greet from a very friendly man named AJ. He got our drinks (which came out at different times) and got us started and Also apologize for our wait, which was nice. 
Third our server who never introduced her self approached our table and said \"are yalls ready to order.\" My friend asked her what her name was which it was JESSICA and also told her that it was our firsts time blasé blasé. Then we proceed to order. After we order we waited for our food which didn't take to long which was great. 
This is where all the real problems start.
Fourth my friends biscuit was dry and gross which they replaced with a fresh one. Our pancakes on the other hand were TERRIBLE. I had a party of 3 and all of our HATED it. We each barely took two bites each. (It was a double stack)
we would of or could of told our server but she never came by to Check on us until she dropped our check. Which she didn't even have the courtesy to ask us for boxes nor did she noticed our pancakes were barely UNTOUCHED. 
We asked this gentleman for a manager and waited five mins and asked another server for a Manager and she came back and said that she was taking a order and she be right over. 
That's when JESSICA came over asked us what was wrong we told her we already asked for a manager she proceed to ask is what's wrong we told her we didn't like the pancakes and she told us \"well they're cooked right so i don't know what to tell you\" that when I said this is exactly why we asked for a MANAGER. Then this lady named Mariah came over and introduce her self has Mariah and not the manager. We told her we didn't like the pancakes she apologized and said there was nothing she could do. I was shocked. I offered to pay for the partial pancake we did try but I was not going to pay for something I Believed to be wrong/gross. Mariah told me that she wasn't the manager and wasn't authorized to take anything off my bill and that there was no manager on site to help me and that if I came back she could give me some free pancakes next time. Excuse me if I didn't like the pancakes why the HELL would I come back for more pancake. So as I'm talking with Mariah ,JESSICA came to the table and said there's nothing wrong with the pancakes we've been serving them all day and that they were fine and no one has complained all day  then walked away. 

JESSICA was so rude and unprofessional that even Mariah noticed and after JESSICA Walked away Mariah apologize for JESSICA behavior and told us to hold on and she was gonna be right back. She came back with our bill and took the pancakes off and gave us some French toasts. At this point I was so fed up that o asked for the owners number which she gave me. She told me that he was just in the building but was to busy to talk with me and had to leave and that I should just call him. My bill was over 53 dollars after the pancakes where takin off so money was never an issue its the fucking service. They never even offer to remake them for us or get us something different instead the wanted to argue with me gang up on me at the table and proceed to tell me that they can not and will not help me.  I Called the owner twice the first time he said he'll call me back with the hour, two hours later nothing. I called again he said he'll call me back in 30 mins. Six hours went by NOTHING. At about 8:45 Bahador Emamzadeh the owner called me back. He was very upset I was calling his phone on his day off and that I had no right to call him so many time cause he was with his kids. I  informed him that maybe he should have a business card with his personal sale phone and title that says owner of he doesn't want to handle owner situations!!! And how am I supposed to know your busy you never TOLD me that. Any ways I told him how upset I was and my horrible experience and told him I didn't want free food or anything but I felt like he needs to know how his restaurant is ran when he's not there. This is the worst place ever. 4/11/16"}
{"text":"Not impressed... nothing was homeade!! The gravy for the bisquits and gravy was a package mix, the corned beef hash came out of a can, the pancakes tasted like uber-dry bisquick mix and the service was horrible.  The only thing that might have been fresh were the eggs."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today.  My husband ordered the chicken fried steak which was beautiful, could cut with a fork BUT for a restaurant who has yolks in their name think they could cook a over medium egg.  The white was just barely cooked through.  The whites should be soft but solid and the yolk should be thick and runny not like water which it was.  The service was also lacking.  The waiter delivered our food asked if we needed anything else but we did not see him again until he picked up our check.  Never asked during our meal if we needed anything or ask how our meal was when he did pick up our check.  When he returned for our signature simply stated here you go.  No thank you ect., but the WORST came when I explained about his service and the eggs and that we would not be returning but wanted them to know why, his response was all of \"NOTED\".  Doubt he ever let management know.
No apology, no give us one more chance.  The bill had already been paid so we weren't looking for a freebie but a little damage control would have been good or at least acknowledging a patron during their meal."}
{"text":"awesome breakfast spot!! went here before going hiking and got the griddle platter! that's a must try! pitas with breakfast is a game changer!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since it was the griddle. Food is always good and service is always friendly. Every time my family comes to visit from out of town we head here for breakfast."}
{"text":"This has become are family's go to for yummy pancakes!!  Favorites would be \"the lips\" and \"s'mores\". The skillets are amazing as well.  On busy days they could us more staff, but other than that great place to go!"}
{"text":"I don't usually like to leave negative reviews, but the service we received and my overall experience has prompted me to do so today. We were placed right by the door and had to deal with waiting customers being jammed up next to us as they waited to be seated. When we were seated, we sat for about 20 minutes with no menus or drinks. My friend had to flag down a waitress to get the menus. We then had to wait about 20 more minutes to get the order taken and then 20 more minutes for the food. The pancakes were big and doughy, not at all appetizing. Just a bad experience overall and I won't be going back. Its so sad because I was excited to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Got a burger here as we came around lunch. The bun as really good. The staff was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Iv been living in the Las Vegas valley for some 23yrs my wife and I go out to eat allot specially we have our once a week date breakfast we look forward to becuz I put in tons of hours at the job..this place has to be the worst breakfast Iv ever had in this city corner hash was out the can,coffee was way worst then u get at a  gas station.eggs cold portions terrible I could have had a better breakfast at a Buffett STAY AWAY AT ALL COST"}
{"text":"I loved it! The service was impeccable, the food was on point and I loved the decor. 

Saw that they had 3.5 out of 5 stars on Yelp but decided I was in the mood for a late breakfast and they were conveniently located. I don't know why they only have 3.5 stars. The waiter was attentive, friendly, informative and quick! We got our fresh squeezed orange juice immediately and perhaps less than 10 minutes after ordering our food was in front of us. 

The orange juice was delicious. Fresh squeezed yumminess. The poached egg on the eggs Benedict was perfectly cooked. Love when you cut into the egg and it drizzles perfectly over the Canadian bacon and English muffin. The home fries that they were served with were perfectly seasoned and the small biscuits and gravy I ordered were perfectly smothered in honest how gravy. Yum! 

I also had a bite of my fiancé's French toast and wow was it good. Fluffy, cinnamon, sugary delight! They cooked the side of bacon he ordered just as requested extra crispy! They were just on point. 

We're looking for a house in the area and once we move I think this'll be my go to breakfast joint."}
{"text":"I only gave this place two stars because the server was really nice. 

The food on the other hand was crap. Everything was ice cold, the brown sugar that came with my oatmeal was rock hard like it had been sitting out there all day. I only came here because my boyfriend dragged me here. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Just left for the second time in 3 weeks after horrible service! If the food wasn't so good, I wouldn't be back. The girl that was working today was awful! A helpful hint for management to her, when you forget a customer's water 3 times, a simple,\"I'm sorry is helpful.\" And then bring the water. Leave the attitude behind. This is the second bad service visit out of 3 due to this girl.  6/1/17 at 11:30am."}
{"text":"Ran into this place randomly last Saturday morning and boy are we glad we did. My husband and I Thoroughly enjoyed their peanut butter pancakes, eggs Benedict and fresh squeezed orange juice! We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Wow! Portions are really good. I couldn't finish my food. I had the Monterrey skillet and red velvet pancakes. The pancake was the size of at least 8 inches in diameter. It was huge. Taste was ok. Lol I did enjoy the skillet. It had chicken, cheese, mushrooms and I added spinach, all over potatoes."}
{"text":"I could not decide between the cranberry pancakes (they have about 10 kinds), and (4 different) Eggs Benedict.  Both were EGG-cellent!

Services was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"This is a great place to bring the family for breakfast. It was busy this Fathers Day Sunday, but we got in within 15 minutes of arriving. Great food making it a great start to the day! Try it out, guaranteed that you will love it!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, nothing compared to the Stacks and Yolks off Durango. Service was slow, no smiles, and my breakfast arrived a tad cold. My daughter loved her fries, they were hot and crisp. My daughter spilled her orange juice, and after telling the third waitress about it, she came back with a mop, but my daughter didn't get another drink. 

 Living in a city that's known for their hospitality i can tell you that this place is lacking and they had broken furniture. No one asked how our meal was, not even a follow up to check on our empty cups. I couldn't recommend this restaurant, not with the numerous breakfast places that get packed with customers and they're still able to provide excellent service. 

Ok I've been here for over an hour, I'm looking around, and my check has yet to arrive."}
{"text":"Service is really friendly and very welcoming! The pancakes are really good ... And massive! I got a skillet and to be honest it was okay. Just a personal preference, I like the potatoes on my skillets to be really crispy! The potatoes on these skillets are largely cut so I didn't enjoy it. I would still love to come back a try the other pancakes, French toast, and chicken and waffles! I would personally just not order another skillet! But amazing amazing service, I read other reviews saying they had poor service and that's really surprising."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite breakfast spots except the service is continually getting worse.  Today we went at 10:40 and there was a wait as usual.  The hostess seemed more concerned with speaking to the black male server with the beard rather than paying attention to the patrons.  She called us the wrong family 3x.  We were finally sat 20 mins later and asked for a high chair but she left.  A blond girl came by to bring silverware and we asked her for a high chair.  She brought the high chair and left and no server came by for another 10 minutes to get our drink order with a \"has anyone gotten your drinks\".  At this point we watched the hostess and server talking, 3-4 other servers walk past us multiple times, and seems like everyone is just the blind leading the blind. We received our drinks and then another 15 minutes went by and a taller white male server said \"do you guys still need more time or are you ready to order\".  I said to the server \"we were never needing more time\".  We finally ordered at 23 minutes after being sat.  Our 2 year old was starving and irritable, and we asked if there were any crackers and we were told there were not.  It took 15-20 minutes to get our food from there and we were served with the same tables that sat way after us.  It's really unfortunate the teams lack leadership and structure because as a former server, i try to be understanding to busy restaurants but this is not a big restaurant and coming from both breakfast spots and fine dining, there was no reason they couldn't handle it with 5-6 open tables at the time we were placing our drink order when it's more a 3 server set up. 

If you want good food they definitely have it, but save your tip and order it to go."}
{"text":"On May 7th my husband and I tried to place an order by phone & no one would answer!! We tried like 3X and nothing. I end up going and as I was there standing to wait to place my I call again. I called to see if maybe their phone were not working . To my surprise I hear it ring. I ask one of the workers \"do you guys not answer calls?\" He replied no we don't we are to busy? ? So I place my order and I was told to give them 15min. I go outside since it's so crowded inside. I come back and when I paid for my food the total was 45 dollars . It seemed a lot for the order I placed ... either way I paid , when I got home we realized they placed our order wrong & charged us for extra food!!! So not cool!! food is great but service sucks!!!"}
{"text":"The food size is amazing! 
The price is moderate lil bit expensive
The Food Quality is good Specially Meat Lovers and Velvet Pancakes

The wait is long on peak hours brace yourselves!"}
{"text":"Some solid pancakes here. I tried the peanut butter batter with whipped cream, chocolate chips, and bananas. While I didn't detect any peanut butter flavor in the pancakes themselves (I suspect just normal batter was used and the peanut butter request forgotten), the pancakes were still quite good. Also shared a patty melt (hey I was hungry) and that was also good. However, I requested swiss cheese and the server was supposed to check if they had it and didn't return until the food came and they used cheddar. Oh well. That brings me to the service. The service was so-so. We had to wait a while to order and then wait a while for refills. Service was kind, but not attentive. That's what brought the rating down. Still, if I'm in the area, I'd try this place again."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and it was a little underwhelming. The server was very friendly and we got sat right away. However, they were out of lemons for my ice tea and the silverware was dirty. I asked for a coffee and when I got to the bottom the cup had old food stuck in it. Our food took average time to show up and we asked for a third setting of silver for my fiancé but never received it. Our friend ordered the pancakes with bananas and it came with no bananas. We asked the server for them and she said she put in there order. And again they never showed up even thought we where charged for them. The restaurant started to fill up and we noticed our server was the server for all 20 tables including the patio. We all work in the restaurant industry and I don't care how good you are it is impossible to take care of that many guests. The server looked frantic and overwhelmed. She did have two bussers helping her but that was all. I am giving three stars even though it should only be one. The staff tried their best and where still very friendly even though they where in the weeds. My suggestion is to properly staff for breakfast/lunch on a Saturday at noon. Unfortunately we won't be back but I hope this review helps management improve things for future guests."}
{"text":"I had higher expectations for this place. 
It's a cute little breakfast place, but the food was a bit overpriced. 


I came here because a couple girlfriends came here a few weeks ago on their Vegas vacation. Their schedule was booked so I met them at the griddle. (I already are breakfast but one girlfriend insisted I take her leftover for my daughter)
So I didn't get to try the food fresh when it was ordered, since I came at the end of their meal. 
It had apple slices and cinnamon which was amazing. The pancakes were so thick and it was as big as the plate! So it was hard fitting it in the to-go box. 

Weeks passed, I passed by it on my daily drive when it finally hit me...gotta eat here one day. 

I came for breakfast yesterday, it was good. 

Walking in was kinda weird. You're not sure if you seat yourself or get seated by the host. She was a quirky tall blonde chick who had the attention span of a squirrel. 
It was hard to get accommodated with our drinks and menus in a timely manner. And as we were reviewing the menu, she tells us there's an additional menu up at the front on the wall. 

My boyfriend mentioned it was our first time, then out of nowhere we had a server switch. The \"owners best friend\" as he told us, was friendly. 
He told us to not try the pancakes and explore the menu. He hooked it up with mini pancakes. 
We noticed the chicken and waffles and our server said they were better than roscoes. 
I asked if he's tried roscoes and he didnt which got me thinking \"how can you say these are better than roscoes if you haven't tried them either?!\"
The waffle was very poorly made. It was flavorless and the corners were uncooked and soggy batter gushed out, which just means they were trying to rush my order.
My boyfriend ordered the eggs benedict which was also 9.99 in my opinion a bit over priced.
he had the crab cake which had a corner of it still frozen. Just the fact of having frozen food served to you is a big turn-off.
My boyfriend ended up eating a piece and gave the rest to the dog. 


I shouldn't have listened to the server, but I guess we all were happy with the fact that he was  going to give us free pancakes.

I might go back if a group of friends wants to meet up, other than that I probably wont be back for awhile.



Service was alright
parking was plenty

food was overpriced and undercooked


next time if I do go I know I will go with what I initially plan on ordering...
the pancakes"}
{"text":"1st impressions count n i was not impressed. For a slow, late Monday morning the service was mediocre. Getting served bad coffee in dirty coffee mugs and having to ask to be served coffee as opposed to being asked if i would like more coffee on a constant basis is not my idea of good service. Food presentation and taste was good aside from the large egg shell in my Californian Eggs Benedict. It did get it replaced along with a small apology and an unprofessional explanation of how the server reprimanded the cook, in my opinion not necessary to let me know. Spending a bit over $50 on breakfast for 3 people is not worth the visit."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times because I enjoy their pancakes, which are enormous. I love the different batters, & toppings & fixings they have to customize it the way you want.

I can always expect there to be a wait at Stacks & Yolks. During my recent visit, my boyfriend called to ask how long the wait was. It was 20 min. & they put our name down for a table so by the time we got there, we could get seated.

As usual, it was packed. The weather is nice so they had their outdoor seating, which doesn't look very organized as the set-up of the restaurant isn't meant for outdoor seating. That point was proven because a table managed to dine & dash. With tables hidden behind pillars & many people standing around waiting for a table, no one noticed a family with kids got up & left without paying. There was a waiter who was getting angry about it, blaming his other co-workers & cursing in front of everyone outside.

We got seated by the door inside. The waiter just cleaned it as they sat us down & left it very sticky. It's Spring now, but DO NOT sit by the door when it's Winter. The door opens & closes giving you a gush of cold air every time.

I dropped something on the ground & when I picked it up, I noticed how dirty everything was. My boyfriend went to the bathroom & said it was horrible.

I was not happy with my order of \"Crab Cake Benedict,\" but my boyfriend's \"Lemon Blueberry Pancakes with Whipped Cream Cheese\" were delicious. I never not order pancakes here so I know now to just stick with pancakes.

Overall, it's okay. It's not the best breakfast spot, but if I want pancakes, it's an option."}
{"text":"We've given this restaurant 3 chances and can't say we'll give it a 4th.  The service is just ok, the food is just ok, and once it wasn't even ok.  I had ordered a Belgian waffle and when I cut into it, the batter ran into the plate.  When I sent it back, they told me that if I wanted it well done, I should've ordered it that way.  Call me crazy, but I always thought waffles were served in their solid state?

Try #2, eggs over medium.  They came to me not even over easy (still had all the clear goo all over them).  I ate them because I didn't want to get berated for not ordering correctly again.

Arrived at 7:30 this morning for try #3 (we've given them a year to figure things out since our last visit) and we had to wait for silverware because they were \"waiting for clean silverware to come out.\" At 7:30am?? Maybe they only have 6 forks or something?

If you have to go here, stick with their pancakes, and maybe bring some silverware from home just in case. :-)"}

     Only downside is that they're typically busy and it's not a very large restaurant."}

Food was cold & horrible. Will not go back.

{"text":"So I finally got to try their marinated steak breakfast.  Steak had no flavor, it was very hard to cut and chew.  I don't see why it's one of their signature dish according g to the last server."}
{"text":"Our family Saturday breakfast, at least once a month! I usually try and be good by eating a vegetarian omelette... but always end up eating my kids' flavored pancakes, waffles and french toast. Particularly love the apple cinnamon or pumpkin pancakes."}
{"text":"Sunday around 11a was my second time here and both times the food was really good.  The service on the second time seemed to be lacking, honestly.  The crowd was about the same compared to the first visit, about a 15 min wait to be seated, but it took them about 10 mins just to get us a cup of coffee.  There were plenty of servers whizzing by, but it seemed we were invisible for about 10 mins when we sat down.  After that, it didn't change much.  Our order wasn't accurate, we didn't get the hot sauce or extra napkins we asked for.  Our tip was less than we normally leave to reflect that.  

HOWEVER, having said all of that, I'd most likely return cause the food is really good."}
{"text":"I LOVE everything about this place. The staff, decor, food, the owner; all of it. The servers, bussers, and runners are all friendly and all have awesome personalities. The head honcho though is kick ass. He's hilarious and always takes good care of us every time we come in. I've tried almost all the pancakes they have but my all time favorites are \"The Lips\" (red velvet with strawberries) and the \"Always November\" which is pumpkin pancakes with whipped cream and cream cheese. The only \"bad\" thing I have to say is that the location is small. Hopefully in the future they can knock down some of the walls and make the place bigger because it is a little cramped. Aside from that:

-Prompt service
-Awesome staff
-Bomb food

What more do you need? There won't be a Sunday that I don't have breakfast here."}
{"text":"Food is okay, the pancakes are good and you get big portion. It is nothing spectacular. It's ihop quality food but more expensive. The service was extremely poor. We waited an hour to be seated and another hour to get our food. I would not go back, there are  better breakfast options around the area."}
{"text":"Food is great, staff works their ass off and makes sure everyone is greeted and helped. If you're in a hurry call ahead and get your food to go. This place is always slammed but worth it every time."}
{"text":"this place is a dump.. take one look into the kitchen and you'll see... looks like they never clean back there.. if you like good healthy food i would avoid this place at all costs.  Ihop or dennys is a healthier option than this place.. if you do eat here you'll notice how greasy everything is.. they use butter for everything..so if you're a vegan lol well you won't be a vegan for one meal.

If you want a real breakfast place, one that won't make you want to take a nap right away, go to egg works or the cracked egg.. they are close and much better.

ALSO, The OWNER.. wow what a piece of work, he's rude, inattentive and had a GUN out on the counter showing his coworkers when i came in... obviously not a family friendly restaurant.,,UNPROFESSIONAL"}
{"text":"This restaurant is really cute,  cute little family oriented restaurant. I had the corn beef hash with potatoes, eggs and toast and it was YUMMY! They serve in large portions so be prepared. The waitress was pretty nice,  she ended up leaving half way through serving us and we got a new server but that's alright. They are only open from 7am-3pm, check it out early!"}
{"text":"Usually a good experience but today the \"home fries\" were quite literally just boiled chunks of potatoes. I tried addimg tobasco but then it was just boiled potato with hot sauce on it. My servers response \"well not much you can really do to potatoes\". Extremely disappointing in service and food quality."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time. Service is always pleasant and fast and food is always ridiculously good. I've seen a bunch of celebrities in here too, from TJ Lavin to Frank Mir, there's always famous people eating here."}
{"text":"This place has been my go-to for years! Food is delicious, coffee is hot, and the staff is super friendly and attentive! Kate is by far the best server! Absolutely love her!"}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast! Their pancakes are huge and they have such a fun variety. This time I got the birthday cake pancakes. They looked so pretty when they came out to the table. They are funfetti pancakes with whipped cream, strawberries and sprinkles on top. They tasted amazing! I then got a side of eggs and sausage. I should have only gotten the sausage because I was too full to finish the eggs. They also have your traditional breakfasts that isn't all dessert if pancakes aren't your thing. We came early on a Friday so it wasn't too crowded and service was good. Great place to try if you're looking for a yummy breakfast place."}
{"text":"We've been going here for 2yrs and just recently, in last 3-4months weve noticed service has been going down. U have 1 waitress/waiter for ALL the tables, several buser and 1 food runner. I always get the same thing.. omlete w/spinach & feta, and every time i have to send it back because its still \"wet\" inside.. they say its the spinach but spinach is not yellow!! On other times, we seen the waiter talk down to the staff, curse at them, talk bad & how stupid they are to us & complain abt the owner on how Cheap is like to be. We have seen this place just go down and its sad cuz it was great and still can be! Just need better management on staff to make things flow better!!"}
{"text":"I've dined here quite a few times with friends so this review is long overdue. Usually when I come it's packed and there's a short wait. I came yesterday later in the day around 1 and there was hardly anyone in there. So if you're coming early in the morning be prepared to wait for at least 15/20 minutes. They have an awesome breakfast and lunch menu with really good options. I try something new every time. My first time here we had the chicken and waffles which were disappointing, the chicken was flavorless and the waffle was meh. My friend had the red velvet pancakes which were delicious though. I've had 3 of there egg Benedict's which I loved! The traditional was my favorite. The crab one was lacking something. The California Benedict was good not amazing though. I definitely recommend there skillets! We had a steak one with 3 sunny side eggs on top and man was that tasty! All of the skillets come with home fries (chopped potatoes) on the bottom. You have the option of egg whites or eggs prepared to whatever your liking is on top of the skillets. The service is always quick and friendly, I've never had a bad waiter or bad experience dining here. The only thing this place is missing is bottomless bloody Mary's and mimosas lol."}
{"text":"This is our absolute favorite breakfast spot. Our server Brandon, really goes above and beyond to make sure our experience is enjoyable time and time again."}
{"text":"There's no excuse for the slow service, it ruined what should have been a good meal.  The other reviews show there is clearly a problem with the service here."}
{"text":"Okay. So I am giving them a 1 STAR. Not for the food. Not for the staff. For the fact that they have been open since this early Morning with NO A/C..... 
as soon as you walk in you can feel the thick humid shitty air. Mind you I came in around 1pm.
As soon as you sit down you start to sweat.
The STAFF.... Amazing. I give them all 5 Stars. Kept great composure even though they are dying from working in that crazy heat.
The food. Good as expected.
The OWNER..you mama get the 1 star. I was tempted to contact the health department about your lack of professionalism. To operate a food establishment with No working A/C is a recipe for disaster. It was 97 degrees inside the restaurant! 
On top of all this. The owner would not give any sort of Discount. I was informed by a staff member that I was the 5th or 6th person to ask for a discount. But the owner said no. 
I watched people walk out because it was so hot. Parents fanning their children. staff with rosy red cheeks and asking to have water poured on them. 
This is sad. I have run food restaurants before and if that A/C goes out in the Middle of summer (110 degrees out that day) my FIRST priority would be to get it back on. 
If I have to run to Walmart and Buy 10 fans I would. Customers keep your business running. Without them you CLOSE!! 

Sorry to the staff for such an unexperienced owner."}
{"text":"My coworker and I were craving some breakfast food and we came across stacks and yolks. 
We ordered food off of postmate (delivery service, check it out its pretty cool) any way
i ordered the steak tips it was really good very pleased with my order. the biscuit and gravy was also really good. my coworker ordered the hobo skillet she is also happy with her order, although she wasnt a big fan of the biscuit and gravy. i live in the sw area and always drove by this place, cant wait to bring the whole family here!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this restaurant because my husband had been wanting to go. We got here around 9:00 on a Saturday morning and were told that it would be a 20 minute wait.  We watched other tables be cleared and sit unoccupied for a while, then were seated. 

Initially, I was fine with this.  It's a Saturday and it's breakfast time.  But as we sat down (just the two of us) a few things started to bother me. 

As we were putting our order in, another table of two was seated.  They got their food 10 minutes before we did.  Our food took about 40 minutes to be brought out (for an omelette and a waffle).  We were on the verge of walking out the door.  Because right before we got our food, a table of four that arrived after us got theirs.  I waited 40 minutes for a lukewarm omelet with cold home fries.  My husband had a churro waffle and said it was \"alright\". 

Pretty disappointed.  There were good things.  The OJ was fresh, the server was friendly.  However, that server and at least one other, both who had long hair, were wearing their hair down.  Not even pulled back.  Definitely rubbed me the wrong way."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  My bf wanted to go to Denny's, but I insisted on coming here because I drive past it on my way to work and always see the \"Best of Vegas\" sign. We came in around noon on Sunday and it was a little busy but didn't seem crazy. We were sat after 15 minutes and our server took our order right away. I got coffee and the rebel eggs Benedict and my bf got meat lovers scramble. Then we waited...and waited...and waited. They didn't even come back to refill my coffee after asking random servers twice. Finally our food came after an hour of waiting. 

My BFs scramble was good, but my eggs were completely over cooked. No run at all. At this point we were starving and I did not want to have to wait another hour to get them fixed. The hollandaise was good though. 

So over an hour and $25 later, I must say I wish we had gone to Denny's instead."}
{"text":"Definitely NEEDS IMPROVEMENT of their customer service. The food would have been great, but we already bought here several times and they mess up the order almost each time!.. So its not like we didn't give them a chance. First they charged extra for guacamole and they didn't even give the guacamole. Then another time they couldn't even give a substitute for your order (example: a side salad instead of fries). Next we just ordered to go, paid for it, and waited almost half an hour, followed up 3x (they keep saying its not ready), and they did not even do it because they couldn't find our order? They weren't even apologetic. Unbelievable right? Well good thing we had copy of the receipt and just refunded our order."}
{"text":"Right to the point.  The food service was slow, although the severs were nice.  I ordered an omelet with spinach, mushrooms, jalapeños, and potatoes.  The small portion of potatoes was under cooked and the omelet was over cooked.  I sent that plate back to the kitchen and just asked for 2 over easy eggs and toast.  The eggs came back fried on the bottom and was tasteless.  After that I simply asked for my check so I could get out of there.  I think this place may only be good for sweet breakfasts (e.g. French toast, pancakes, etc.).  I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"biggest pancakes I've ever seen!!  nevertheless delicious.  My personal favorite is the red relvet pancake and the philly cheese skillet.  The biggest thing that stands out about stacks n yolks is the service.  People are attentive and the owner is always walking around checking up on things.  The only thing I wish they had was a pillow after the meal!"}
{"text":"This place was the worst service and food I've ever had. The SERVICE was HORRIBLE. First our server didn't fill up our drinks periodically she only ever came back when we were all done with our food. I got the Kits homemade corn beef hash. It's states that it this 4 hour corn beef and yet I swear to you it was the can of corn beef you get from the grocery store. This place is a rip off and I advise you to not go. The \"home fries\" are BIG cut up plain potatoes. So be aware. I ILL NEVER SOEND ME MONEY HERE EVER AGAIN, and I advise you to do the same."}
{"text":"They are great local eatery for those who live in the Southwest Area, I personally live in Rhodes Ranch and this place is my favorite place to come to for breakfast. Baha the owner is always super friendly and makes sure he has unique creations for people to try. What I like most is they have healthy options or not so healthy options and will allow you to customize your order. Most places give you hassle for that."}
{"text":"If you love breakfast, you'll LOVE this place! Great breakfast served ALL DAY! I've tried almost half the menu, and I have no complaints. Baha, the owner, is very helpful and accomodating. All of the pancakes here are works of art...from concept, to taste, to presentation. If you're on a diet, I don't recommend coming here because their pancakes & skillets will be too tempting; however, the \"Griddle Platter\" is a healthier option. I also love the fact that they have fresh squeezed orange juice. Their food is delicious, and their customer service is great!"}
{"text":"Stopped but for some good breakfast a n good breakfast we received. Just enough to fill you as you start the day.  My chicken fried steak and eggs were delish. Hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Was greeted as soon as I walk in an sat at a booth. Although the booth is broken I truly didnt care because I was a single party this am. My only two complaints is the service with my actual server \"K\" and My food is cold. Not a little cold it was cold cold, potatoes under cooked and cold eggs cold bacon cold and toast very cold seriously.... come on....?  (ONLY NOT COLD THING WAS MY PANCAKES AN MY COFFEE) I didnt complain though. Because, she was to busy talking to the other two ladies in a booth in the corner whom obviously occupied her time more then her 3 to 4 other tables did. Needless to say mediocrity in service, is not what I will be back for. MAYBE, a possible take out lunch is probably a better option for me. Very disappointing to say the least. Especially, since I heard so many good things about this place."}
{"text":"Great food and loved the variety of dishes. But the Manager Brandon and Andrew topped it all off with their witty and fun personalities.  They really made it a good experience"}
{"text":"What a great place for pancakes! It was clean and everyone was very friendly. There are several options for pancakes (see pics) and they are very large and very good. Food was delivered quickly and service was quick. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I order this via Postmates. I probably won't ever purchase from here again. I requested Red Velvet pancakes with whipped cream cheese. I got Red Velvet pancakes and whipped cream cheese AND STRAWBERRY SYRUP!!! Who does that? There was so much strawberry syrup, the pancake tasted cheap. Also, they aren't careful with their potatoes. I found ham and sausage in my \"house fries\". I'm a vegetarian. It was sloppy and looked like they just tossed stuff around. On top of all of that, this place is EXPENSIVE. I've had better pancakes at IHOP."}
{"text":"First off I tried to call for take out and no one answered. Ended up driving over to place an order and wait there. When i got there they told me to go to the register to place my order and it took quite a bit of time for anyone to even acknowledge me. The guy workers there look like they hate their life and they would rather be somewhere else. Someone did finally took notice of me and she was extremely nice and took my order. Once I got my order I headed home and to find my order of pancakes were completely wrong and to find my chicken fried steak was so small. I know it was bit my fault I didnt check the order before I left. I assumed that the order was simple enough. I did try to call them again to let them know in a chance they could start creating the correct set of pancakes for my daughter and have it ready when I arrived. Again no answer so I didn't attempt to even go back. I just wont be back. If you are looking for breakfast just drive down or order from IHOP. Their food is 100x better I would say."}
{"text":"This place has taken a serious left turn in quality and service. I always get a skillet and a pancake when I come but over the years, I've come less and less and after today's visit... it's most definitely the last. The pancake batter had too much flour, which gave it a rubbery texture and only one side of the pancake was cooked while the other remained uncooked. I wanted to tell our server to replace it with a different batter but she was too busy ignoring us. My skillet consisted of maybe half a turkey sausage patty and they were stingy with the potatoes. The only reason I'm being harsh is because this place used to always deliver in quality AND quantity. It's just no good anymore unfortunately. I guess that happens when you get \"too big\"."}
{"text":"Last time we ate here I was a bit disappointed with the texture of the Buttermilk pancakes - too chewy,  lacking fluff. This time we're trying a Belgian waffle combo (1 waffle, 2 eggs and 2 bacon or sausage - we're trying the turkey sausage). Large menu for breakfast,  lunch and some seriously wild pancake-based desserts! One of these days we'll come for dessert.  

Okay, taste: Unfortunately,  waffle was also surprisingly DENSE.  Not really up my alley. Turkey sausage was decent, especially dipped in pancake syrup. Otherwise,  it was a bit on the dry side. Eggs were perfectly prepared."}
{"text":"Pancakes were dry and needed a knife to cut. Freezing in their. A/c was on and 32 degrees outside."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing pancakes. Would get 5 stars, but knocked down for slow service. But, food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great food, fluffy beautiful pancakes. Fresh strawberries that were hand cut. The coffee was hot and perfectly brewed. Honestly, this is one of the best breakfast restaurants I've ever been to. Our server, Brandon, was charming and funny. There is no reason to go anywhere else, seriously."}
{"text":"Normally I'm not one for a big sit down breakfast/brunch but this place has really great food with generous portion! 

Came here on a Sunday morning, the wait wasn't that long, we waited for 20 minutes, maybe. Ordered an egg white omelette with mushroom, sausage and jalapeños. Friend ordered the country skillet with a side of French toast. I tried the French toast and it was to die for. It was difficult to just eat a bite and let my friend eat the rest. My omelette was really good, it came with a side of home fries and toast--the whole meal was so big that I was able to take home half the omelette and half the toast. Server was attentive, she made sure our drinks were always filled and checked on us every so often."}
{"text":"Omg where do I start! This place is a hot mess! 

Joel and I were on this side of town for his job and we hadn't eaten breakfast. Since it was a Monday other places in the area were closed. So Stacks & Yolks it was. 

Right away when you walk in there is confusion. It's not a lack of staff either. There are plenty of people just total unorganization. When we were finally seated. (There was a hostess stand outside, but no hostess.) We weren't even given menus. We had to sit there for a while until we finally could flag someone down. They took our drink orders and came back to take our order. I had decided on the Crab Cake Benedict and Joel had the regular Corn Beef Hash with a side of sourdough toast. While waiting for our food I had to practically beg for a refill on my coffee and a water. Also, while we were waiting our waiter came over and asked if we had ordered something that we had not. Then he went around to all the other tables asking who's order it was. Wow. That was not a good sign.
Our food came out and I was ready to dig in. The waiter not the original waiter asked what kind of toast Joel had wanted and he repeated Sourdough. The waiter said it would be right out. My Crab Cake Benedict looked kinda sad. The Crab Cake itself was crisp and tasty, but the Hollandaise sauce was clearly old cause it wasn't runny, but congealed. The potatoes had no flavor and tasted like something they threw on the flat top for 1 minute and pulled off. Well, after 10 minutes Joel finally got his toast. It wasn't Sourdough however, but Wheat. It was so dry and cold that the fake butter wasn't even melting. It was some seriously sad toast. Talk about sad was Joel's Corn Beef Hash. We were both assuming it would be freshly made in house. We were very wrong. It came out of a can and was gross. I really felt we could have made it better at home. He asked for his eggs to be poached. Which they were, but  they were served in a little bowl that still had some water in it. Why not put them dried on the hash itself?  

So we are done with our meal and I ask for the check. The waiter said he'd bring it over. 15 more minutes roll by and no check. Meanwhile, people were standing outside glaring at us because they are waiting to sit down and eat! The waiter comes back and asks \"have we gotten our check?\" I respond with a \"no.\" He walked away. I was hoping to get the check!! By this time my debit card is out and I'm annoyed. Finally, some other guy brings us our check. I didn't even look at it. I just handed him my card and the response I got was a fist bump. Normally I'm down for fist bumps, but a fist bump is not an acceptable form of apology for bad service and bad food. Just sayin! 

I will never again return here. It was a total waste of my money and my time. Believe me heed my warnings and steer clear!! Run, run now!!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I found this place on Yelp while looking for new breakfast places. The place was packed but no wait to be seated. We were immediately served water and coffee and told about the specials. We decided on two different skillets. Texas and Philly. We also got s pumpkin pancake which is seasonal. Overall, everything was great! Huge portions! Would Recommend sharing entrees!"}
{"text":"Still the best place in Vegas for Breakfast. My family and I have clearly not run into the servers that are listed in other reviews. Both times we have been here, we have had prompt and friendly service with no issues. The food has been amazing both times, trying a couple different dishes this go around. Also the food always gets to us quickly. I am hoping our string of luck with Stacks and Yolks continues, because we really love eating here and will be back often."}
{"text":"Well i had my mouth set on some chicken and waffles so I figured this place would be perfect. Well first off staff was very nice and helpful to my questions. I heard that the red velvet batter was the number one seller so I tried that along with the fried chicken wings. I hated the red velvet waffle mainly because it didn't taste like red velvet whatsoever. The sauce in which they used on top tasted like artificial cherry syrup!!!!! Yucky. Horrible aftertaste. Then the fried chicken were 4 little scrawny pieces either the flat part or drumstick. And the chicken and waffle meal was 11 bucks. Totally not worth it! They have other options for chicken so you can get grilled or fried chicken tenders, wings, or breast. Needless to say I was still hungry after that, and highly disappointed. Guess I will stick to \"the cafe\" chicken and waffles inside of the Monte Carlo."}
{"text":"Omg this place is AMAAAAZING!!!

I've only been here twice and I'm obsessed. Reminds me of a little bit more expensive baby stacks cafe (has list of flavor pancakes) and other unique items! 

Food is incredible! Got to eat the spinach and turkey Benedict. Also the veggie skillet, and churro waffle (obsessed) their hot cocoa is amazing because of the whip cream part, otherwise it's your original dry packet and water in a cup cause I sure tasted 95% water.

There is inside and outside seating which is awkward because it's in a small strip mall. You're basically on a covered sidewalk. Service kinda sucks only if outside. Very reasonable prices and their hours and staff make this place outstanding. Also love their interior!!!!"}
{"text":"We went here last week, first timers, have been wanting to go, we were not disappointed at all....food was great, very filling, prices good. Our server, who is also the manager,  Brandon, was very attentive, great down to earth guy, and I hear we went at a good time, so no wait and it was very pleasant,  we will be returning. Big thumbs up."}
{"text":"I used to lived over in Rhodes Ranch and decided to stop in one morning to check it out. Love a good breakfast. I was completely amazed at the whole experience. The staff and owner are very friendly. The prices are very reasonable for the portions and quality of the food. This place is truly amazing!!  I have been back numerous times and get the exact same service and consistency with the food. EVERYTHING IS SO GOOD!!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!"}
{"text":"If it wasn't so crowded I'd come here more often. Obviously alot of people would agree that the food is good, because I came here one time on a Monday to beat the crowd, I ended up taking my family elsewhere. 
Anyway the 1st time I came here I enjoyed the cran/orange pancake and my wife and I have been thinking  about it ever since, so here we are again. We also liked the steak and eggs /unicorn tears and they will not release the mystical concoction to me even when I asked..."}
{"text":"Great food!  Employees are attentive and nice! Sadie was my server and she was great! Tried a few bites of the lemon blueberry pancake=delish! The jalapeño bacon was awesome. Very satisfied and will come back!!!"}
{"text":"This used to called Griddles...hopefully stacks and yolks can stay.great food and friendly service. I had the garden skillet which was to much for me to eat in one sitting. Can't wait to visit again"}
{"text":"First time here. Unfortunately we had to wait 15 minutes before we were seated. The space inside is very quaint...however, they need to expand. The staff was really nice and attentive. The food was very tasty with the exception of tarnished silverware. Overall, this place isn't to bad."}
{"text":"So I decided after a long day of studying to come into this place. The first thing I did was walk into it, where I was greeted by a host. But I just stood there where there were clearly open tables. So I just stood there....until after 5 minutes I asked if I could sit down. Finally, when i decide to sit down, the busser asked me what beverage I wanted. I got my orange juice. Another 15 minutes passes and no server has greeted me yet, and I'm practically done with my juice. Finally I get slightly frustrated and ask for the bill. The server gives me the bill with no apology or anything. I have never experienced service like this. They didn't even acknowledge me. I'm never going here again and encouraging my friends to not come here as well. I give it 2 stars only because the host and the the busser helped me out"}
{"text":"Gravy on a so so biscuit was truly bland with under cooked flour taste.   Home fries are very plain.  Service was excellent.   Food very overpriced."}
{"text":"The long drive to get here is always worth it! Amazing people working here and the food is always always to die for. The Red Velvet pancakes are a must try and so are the home fries. I love that as soon as you walk in it smells like breakfast at home and the hostess are always very kind and sweet. I def. recommend everyone to go check it out!"}
{"text":"Just plain bad. When I walked into the restaurant the only server on duty was sitting with his friends with his back to the doorway, not cool. The air conditioner was not working in the middle of summer in Vegas so it felt like an oven in there. The food was awful. I will be honest and say that I know it's the \"griddle\" so I probably should have tried the pancakes but since I was on my best behavior I had a cobb salad. I believe any item worthy of being put on a menu should be great no matter the feature. This cobb salad was not a cobb at all. I don't know what the heck this salad was but it didn't even come close. First of all, a cobb has iceberg lettuce, not arugula. Secondly, where were all the traditional toppings of the cobb? Some bacon bits, tomatoes, blue cheese, and packaged turkey meat just don't cut it. How in the heck can a restaurant be successful if you cannot even get the most popular salad in the world right? GEEZ"}
{"text":"this place is ridiculous! 2 people took 20 minutes to sit after we sat i kid you not it was about 40 minutes when the hostess finally came by and said our food was almost ready! waited patiently, after another 5 minutes the people next to us a couple as well received their food before us! we got up and left almost 1 hour and still no food!!!!i don't care if it was a busy day or not if its going to take that long let people the know the wait is 1 hour instead of having them sit there staring at the wall! this is no classy rest for all that! didn't like it the first time food was soooo greasy taught we would give it another try after the remodel, oh hell no will never return! this place sucks! zero all the way!!!"}
{"text":"Only reason a 3 Star is bc the first time I visited here I got the slow roasted homemade corned beef hash and it was alright a bit chunky more skillet like but the second time I came the same thing I ordered came out of a can. Was like Libby's corned beef hash was not even close to what I received a week before. That being said I like the canned kind better than their homemade so I wasn't angry. The waitress I had I could tell was New she brought me wheat toast instead the white I ordered them she brought two orders white toast instead of the one I had asked for. She for got my sausage patty I ordered then tried to tell me I wanted bacon? other than that I could see the manager this dark skinned guy was trying hard to make everything and everyone run smoothly. I think it's a good business and place and people just got the busy chaotic newbie day lol"}
{"text":"Heard about this spot from a few friends and coworkers....

Food is great :) & I recommend getting a skillet! 
Service sucks :(

P.S. 
If you don't like a cup full of pulp stay away from the warm Orange juice."}
{"text":"The food here is really not that great at all.  We have come here a couple times each time hoping that we would be blown away by the food, considering the reviews, but we have always left disappointed. The last time we were here my husband ordered a breakfast sandwich.  The bread was so soaked in butter that it was virtually inedible.  I ordered a skillet and it was bland and boring."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning for breakfast with family from out of town. We had a party of 6 and was told it was a half hour wait. We waited closer to 45 minutes. The hostess was nice and told us we were going to be seated next. Another party of 6 came in about 30 minutes after we had got there and the hostess immediately said we were going to be seated at the same time. The other party of 6 was seated first, then we were seated right after. the hostess advised us we would  have been seated first but apparently the other party had called in prior to arriving. Really? Did they call in before or after we got there. Last I heard also you can't make reservations its first come first serve basis! 

The selection  of food was good but we waited a long time for our food to arrive. When the food arrived, it looked good. Except for the chicken with the chicken and waffles. It could have been crispier. But it was cooked all the way through. the waitress disappeared for awhile and we wee not checked on more than once after our food arrived. After such a long wait and all the hype with this place being tossed around locally, I have to say I was extremely disappointed and will not bring family back here again. They were voted \"Best of  LAs Vegas\" two years in a row but if they keep going this route it won't be 3."}
{"text":"Wow. Ok. I showed up with my daughter on a Tuesday  at noon. I told a waitress that I was waiting for another person to show up. My daughter and I were sat and asked what beverages we wanted. I ordered orange juice for both us... about 5 minutes later she showed up with one napkin and one silverware set (it was a party of three, you do the math)! I asked at 2:11 if I could order my daughters food: 2 scrambled eggs, house fries, and toast. My friend showed up right after and we talked for a little bit then another waiter came up to take our drink order. I reordered my orange juice and my friend got the same thing. They came back with them a few minutes later then took our order. At that point it was around 2:30. While I placed my order i asked the waiter if my daughter's order was put in since that order was given to someone else. He assured me that her order was being made.... 2:45 rolls around and they came out with my daughters scrambled eggs and potatoes. Forgot the toast. My point: why the heck did it take so long to scramble two eggs and serve luke warm potatoes onto a plate and bring it out to a three year old!? My friend was not happy. She asked our waiter why it took so long and he literally said \"sorry new chef\" and walked away. Once they brought our orders out they forgot my toast and got the stack quantity on my friends French toast order wrong so they charged her for more than what she asked for. And i had to take silverware and napkins from empty table next to us! I wish i could say the food was worth it but it wasn't. So mediocre! Needless to say i will never be back! Rude service and food i can make at home is not worth the gas money, time wasted for parking, and cost of the food! Sorry stacks & yolks- it takes a lot to make me write a bad review but people need to know!"}
{"text":"So, we were here again yesterday after work. Man! We were just in time for a table cuz after us there were about 8 person group in line. 
Anywho, we tried their special menu of the day, pork chop. It was damn delicious. Juicy and soft. Must try!"}
{"text":"Do not order their pork chop special, meat had a funky taste to it. They have the tendency to serve unseasoned potatoes. After doing the potatoes one time too many is time to look for another joint. 

Maybe better preps? Oh and someone who can do quality control, that meat was bad."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast earlier this week. The tables outside were dirty and still had food from the people before.  We stood at the podium waiting to be seated for at least 7 minutes so we just sat ourselves. 
It took a good ten minutes before someone cleared the table and brought us new silverware and took our drink order. The table next to us was there before we were and didn't even have menus yet.  

The staff didn't check on us once during our meal. Our meal was bland. I could have made better eggs at home.  Overrated... Just plain Overrated"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, such flavor. I never finish all my food ,and I found myself searching for the crumbs it was that yummy. The service well that's clearly an area of opportunity for them. Next time I'd opp for takeout :)"}
{"text":"Food was good we had the bacon and egg and the BLT. Service was not as great. A couple of times we stopped eating to talk to one another and we still had some food on our plate they tried to come and take our plates twice and we had to tell them we weren't done. To me that was very rude I understand the place is busy and they had a few people waiting on tables but we felt very rushed. Couldn't enjoy our brunch afterwards so doubt we will be back unfortunately."}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying I'm not much of a pancake person.
Pretty solid breakfast. Nothing remarkable, but solid (more like a 3.5 than a 4).
I had my once-a-year pancake urge and decided to try this place. It was ok. Peanut butter pancakes were a bit bland and lacking in PB flavor. Eggs were cooked properly. Service was quick and friendly.
I don't know, I doubt I'd come back. Nothing against this place, but the menu didn't draw me back for more."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite breakfast spots. We always bring our relatives here when they visit. Today was a subpar experience. We called ahead to give them a heads up that our party of 14 was arriving around 10:30am. My brother and I checked in at 10am to put our name down. They did inform us it'll be a while but they had saved tables for us in the back waiting for more tables to clear. Our party had been waiting for quite some time and we noticed the tables had opened up.  After a while when we checked to see if it was ready the host told us she gave away our tables and it'll be another 30 minutes. We were tired of waiting so 11:40am comes around and we mentioned to just sit us separately. The host went in to see what tables were open and never came back out. We sat ourselves on open tables. Being a server I wouldn't appreciate my guests sitting themselves out of rotation especially when I'm not ready for another table but after an hour and forty minutes we had to take matters into our own hands. We started noticing other parties that checked in after us and not waiting long sitting at our tables. We understand it's a small location but we called ahead so the restaurant can be prepared so we could have avoided this problem. What was suppose to be our last family meal before our relatives had to leave we ended up sitting away from each other like strangers. They are other breakfast spots with food just as good and more capacity, leaving stacks and yolks often not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Awful, awful, awful

Went there Sunday (10/19/14) Understaffed, food was lacking flavor, coffee tasted like dirty water, imitation crab in eggs Benedict, and it was expensive. Waited for over 30 min to be seated and 20 min for the check at the end.

NOT EVER GOING BACK"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place due to the reviews.  I was not disappointed by the food.    Pancakes were awesome, ordered the lemon/blueberry, what a treat.  Eggs were cooked perfect and the country gravy was awesome.  Was very happy with the meal and the quick delivery of the meal.  The service needs some work.  had to search for the waitress to get a refill of coffee.  We will be back as a great breakfast is what it is about."}
{"text":"Items Selected:
S'mores - Chocolate Pancakes, Crushed Graham Crackers, Whipped Marshmallow Cream, Toasted Marshmallows
Alabama Slamma - Peanut Butter Pancakes, Bananas, Pecans, Whipped Cream, Chocolate Drizzle
Deep Fried Churro French Toast - Butter, Cinnamon, Sugar, 'Maple Syrup'

Previously called Griddlecakes, a meal in April 2015 at the location on North Jones Boulevard so unmemorable that the connection did not become evident until viewing aged Social Media posts, it was as part of breakfast on Friday that a visit was made to Stacks & Yolks on South Durango Drive, a new name and updated menu from the same ownership seeing the place fare better despite a new set of faults.

Tucked away in a plaza also featuring fast food, foot spas and firearms suppliers, a fairly typical situation for many family-owned Restaurants spread across The Valley, those frequenting the area will likely know the space thanks to bold yellow signage visible from the street and with a large parking lot available those deciding to stop in will find the theme replicated many-fold on the inside where early morning remains fairly quiet save for weekends.

Once known for a fairly typical collection of Eggs, Hashes and Griddles but since going for gusto by way of oversized plates and Pancakes featuring a dozen different Batter flavors plus at least ten Toppings daily, it was immediately upon entry just prior to eight o'clock that guests were greeted and invited to \"sit anywhere you like\" by a lone young server prone to calling everyone \"boss\" or \"my man\" before knocking on tables as if by habit.

No doubt an all-ages environment, two men in suits discussing business at one table while two women, an infant and pre-school aged child occupied a four-top across the way, it was as current Pop staples played overhead that selections were made from a sizable collection, the ability to customize great for those who are picky or with allergies and the prices mostly on par with other independently owned Breakfast places.

Eventually settling on three individual plates priced $5.99 to $8.99, the \"10-Pancakes and 10-Eggs in under an hour\" challenge saved for another day, it was perhaps fifteen minutes before all three items were delivered in succession, the warm pseudo-Syrup quickly set aside in favor of the good stuff brought from home and first bites of the Churro-style 'Short Stack' immediately proving worthwhile as the fried Bread thickly coated in Cinnamon and Sugar offered a great crunch that quickly gave way to a soft custard-soaked center.

Moving next to the Pancakes, two $5.99 specialty singles requested and both barely visible beneath a mountain of toppings, it is surprisingly in their signature item that Stacks & Yolks comes up short as a result of flavors that simply taste 'off,' the use of syrups or concentrates likely at fault as the Peanut Butter's faint taste was almost imperceptible while the Chocolate tasted mostly like Hot Cocoa Mix, though in both cases the combination of Whipped Cream and all the rest were enough to make them mostly enjoyable.

***In a city with no lack of Breakfast joints, both chains and independently owned, Stacks & Yolks falls somewhere towards the middle of the pack in terms of everything from price to service to the food itself."}
{"text":"Best is early morning, it's not as crowded. Friendly enough staff, but a bit tight inside. In other words, everyone is on top of one another."}
{"text":"Wanted to try it since the name change. Was seated quickly considering was busy. Took a few minutes for drink and food order but not a big deal considering looked like there was one main server for the whole place. Did wait a long time for the food though and when it arrived half our food was cold. Couldn't tell anyone because the next time someone came to the table was when we were done with what we did eat. No refills offered or checked on. I think we will be going somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"This place is sorry!! Last time I ordered to go, waited about an hour then there credit card machine broke and instead of just letting us take the stupid pancakes they said we had to wait for them to fix the machine. Anyhow we decided to give it another try.  We ordered regular and gluten-free pancakes to go, we get home and neither container was marked so I called to ask which one was gluten free and no one ever answered. So screw this place!!!"}
{"text":"Really great food every time we've gone!!  The food is a tiny bit on the pricy side or we would probably visit more, but for now and then it's really good!! It's often crowded on the weekends though, but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Wow, the Philly Skillet was amazing. The place is little bit small, but when you eat the food you forget all about it. Hands down a very good breakfast, brunch place."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely ridiculous, I would not recommend it to my worst enemy. We had breakfast this morning, and after about 15 minutes we were notified that they were out of what we ordered.  We change our order and it took another 20 minutes to get our food. We were there for almost 45 minutes before our meal got there.  

To make things worse, when we got our Bill, they tried to charge us for the items they did not have. I wasn't surprised as this is about the fifth time we've been there and every single time we've been they mysteriously add items to our bill to charge us an additional $10-$20.  And because they didn't have the items we ordered I ordered two fried eggs and a side of bacon, they charge me six dollars for three slices of bacon and another five dollars for two Friday eggs, absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Delicious! This was our first time coming here and I'm glad we did. Our service was excellent, not just from our waiter, but from the entire staff (Even from the chef). The portions were very generous for the price. The menu options all sounded delicious, so I'm positive we will be back to try more out."}
{"text":"Sucks and Yucks. Where do I begin?

Came on a Sunday afternoon, dined al fresco because the weather was beautiful and my party was starving and it meant we would be sat right away. Server came over quickly, teas and coffees arrived, menus were perused, then orders placed...ENTER THE VOID!

Servers disappeared, bussers kept glasses full, but nothing... Our server was MIA and 20 minutes later a table that sat way before we did got food. Ours arrived about 20 minutes after that. I am all fine and dandy waiting for something to be cooked fresh (45 minute waits for Chicago pies is half the adventure), but what arrived came out lackluster, underwhelming, and just gross. 

I got my eggs poached. They were served to me in a bowl and hadn't been drained. One of the eggs was cracked and it was like poached egg soup. What the gross! My friend stated that her meat had no seasonings. The biscuits and gravy were meh (how is there no sausage in the gravy?!). If you order something called huevos Mexicanos, you'd expect it to pack some heat! Not at Sucks and Yucks. Bland and subpar are it's speciality. Home fries which had nothing home-y about them. Not even a sprinkle of salt. Are y'all afraid of the spice rack or some shit? It was just bad, bad, bad. The ONLY redeeming thing about this visit was the pumpkin pancake I ordered. That ish was the bizzzz-ness!

WORST. BREAKFAST. EXPERIENCE. IN. LAS. VEGAS. I could have had 2x the food and it been more palatable at Denny's or IHOP! This is a mom & pop that makes you remember why you HATE going home for the holidays. So much potential down the drain."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday morning around 1030ish. I was by myself and the host sat me right away and got my drink order. Then I waited around for someone to take my food order for maybe 10 mins? I wanted to try the pumpkin pancakes on the specials board, it noted what it came with whipped cream cheese, whipped cream, and cinnamon. Only I didn't want all that whipped nastiness on my pancakes so I asked for it on the side just so I can try A LITTLE bit, I know most places pack that shit on pancakes like crazy haha. I also ordered a side of eggs over easy and some breakfast potatoes, hoping they'd be seasoned. Food came out maybe 20 mins after that.... Whatever, it's a busy, mom + pops breakfast kind of place, don't really expect muuuuch organization haha. My potatoes were bland and I felt dumb for even ordering them haha. Pancakes were good, but no cinnamon.... Not even on the side! I just said whipped cream + cheese on side, I was hoping they'd sprinkle the cinnamon! So I asked my server for it and he brought it out as I'm finishing up my meal haha. Thanks dude. He was pretty slooooow! And the side whipped stuff was waaaay too much, I shouldn't have even wasted it because apparently it's a $1/ea. I was surprised that was on my bill, I thought it came WITH the pancakes that's why I asked for it on the side. That's kind of dumb that they jack you like that, making it seem like it comes with your pancakes. I didn't even finish them, I ordered two and only had half. Should've only ordered one!!! I was happy the manager or owner or whoever the cashier was at least took off the $2 of the whipped toppings because had I known, I obv wouldn't have wasted them. Servers should advise guests when they order those upsells, especially on the side because they're prob doing it to be a liiiittle health conscious haha. Indulging in pancakes is enough of a treat.... All that junk isn't all that necessary! Good stuff, just obv don't expect much service or attention.... Like any other breakfast joint"}
{"text":"We went this morning with a party of 8. We did have to wait a bit longer, and I felt the hostess was not knowledgable about how to figure out what tables will clear out to make the table of 8 the best. I felt like I saw quite a lot smaller tables fill up that came after us-that had she figured it out, could've sat our party a little sooner. It wasn't that big of a deal, just something I noticed. 

On to the service and food. The OJ was fresh, which was nice. I hate bottled fake OJ. I definitely recommend trying at least one of their delicious & different pancake batters. I tried the peanut butter pancake and added chocolate chips to it...SO GOOD. I made it a combo, because I usually just eat eggs. The single stack is HUGE, and great to try with others. My husband had the corned beef skillet-one is fresh, and one is canned. He chose the fresh one. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their food. We had 4 children, and they all enjoyed their food. The waiter was very good, and very nice. It was a bit warm in the rest, but it was super cold out today, so it was actually kind of nice to take sweaters off.

No real complaints on food. We are visiting from out of town, and a part of me wants to go back so I can try a different batter. They were out of mint, and I would like to try that one out."}
{"text":"Not good,  Potatoes burnt the 1st time 2nd time under cooked. Bacon I like crispy but they brought me over cooked crumbly char the 1st time. 2nd time oil temp was wrong an bacon was crispy yet under cooked. Buttermilk stacks needs some flavor attention!
On the up side
  Got the eggs rightthe Waitresses were nice, place has a cool look.
 Chef needs to up his game!!!"}
{"text":"Meh, indeed. 
I'm fine with greasy food after a night out, but this was disgusto greasy. Like, mop my plate and blot my eggs and bacon greasy. The Red Velvet pancakes were fine for the first couple bites, but dried out as you got to the middle. Seating is too close for comfort, and the blasting club music really didn't fit the ma and pa feel this place was probably going for.
The most disturbing part was the faint sulfur smell that came and went during breakfast. They must have had some sewage problems or something. Blech.
I gave it two stars because the service was very prompt, genuinely friendly, and it's not the waiter's fault that the food was ill-prepared."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite breakfast and lunch spot. It's privately owned, which I think adds to the home style atmosphere. We always have breakfast, but i hear the lunches are great too. One friend said that the grilled cheese was the best she's ever had. High praise! 

The skillets are a go-to menu item. They come out hot and sizzling. I recommend the Hobo Skillet; simple and delicious. 

I put four stars because even though the food is amazing, there is always a short wait. At times there is also a crowded feeling, but that's only because so many people want to experience the great food Stacks and Yolks has to offer."}
{"text":"Good service, clean, good food 
Small portions, expensive have to wait till 7 am for this place to open no early breakfast"}
{"text":"The food here is ok (though personally I like pancakes at Babystacks much better) but the food is definitely not worth the wait. We waited for twenty minutes to sit down and then twenty-five minutes for our food after we ordered. And once we ordered we never ever saw our waiter again--guess he was done for the day. So while the food was fine, I definitely won't be back based on the wait and the customer service--not to mention the way all those tables are crammed inside. Not sure how that one got past the fire inspector."}
{"text":"The wait was way too long from the time we sat down to order the food and the time to get our food. I was very disappointed in the quality of the pancakes, especially due to all the specialty batters. I ordered a simple lemon pancake with blueberries. The pancake was inedible. I could not even cut through it with a fork it was so tough. I tore a pieces off with my fingers and decided to feed it to the pigeons outside. Guess what? The birds could not pull it apart and left it to find something edible to eat!!!! Very disappointed. Do not come here for pancakes. Not worth the overpriced amount!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Atmosphere average. Service average. Food..well below average. Bad gravey...no meat, flower and water. Eggs, hasbrowns and toast never done as ordered. They could be packed if they could serve decent food. Alas, not the case."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast in the entire city, and it is awesome!!! Always packed, with a great vibe and energy, this restaurant is predictably great with a varied menu. From the typical eggs and bacon to mexican eggs, this place has it all! Let's not forget their cranberry orange pancakes, or any of the other amazing and unique combinations they have on the menu. Visit this place for breakfast and you will fall in love with it just like I did!"}
{"text":"Great waffles and pancakes! Homemade corn-beef hash"}
{"text":"This is an amazing, quaint and friendly breakfast and lunch spot. Very cozy Hometown Cafe feel. You're always greeted at the door by friendly helpful staff. Staff is knowledgeable about all the menu items. There is so many good items on this huge menu but it's hard for me to get away from my select few favorites. Depending on what time you get there, there is usually a short wait, but that means something in itself. They also have a gluten-free portion of their menu. I got the chorizo scramble and they never let me down with this favorite. It's hard to find a good chorizo platter Always done to perfection. In the freshly ground coffee is always incredible. They also have a Juicer machine that makes amazing fresh orange juice"}
{"text":"I come here all at least twice a week early in the morning and get served by Brandon. He is wonderful and knows my order! But on Sunday's he is he only person in the entire restaurant working. It took almost 40 minutes to get a table, and made for a terrible experience, besides the food of course. He is keeping this place a float. You might want to hire some more people like him or you will soon have an empty restaurant on Sunday's."}
{"text":"Warning....extremely long wait to get food!!
If I could give 0 stars I would. We are a party of 4. It took almost an hour and a half to get our food.  There is only one chef for the entire restaurant, which wasn't explained when we sat down. Plus my eggs weren't cooked over medium when I got them... (I'm pregnant and can't have over easy eggs). 
This place is called stacks and yolks and you can't cook an egg correctly?? 
Tuna melt and fries were beyond greasy. 
You see the bright yellow building proceed with caution!!"}
{"text":"Looking for some good strong coffee and not to mention some good food with great service ... then DONT come here... nice uplifting design inside with that modern touch .
I can't go to IHOP or Denny's any more.."}
{"text":"Disappointed because the batter wasn't cooked all the way on both of our pancake orders. Service was good though"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place. They have good sausage and they make my breakfast just the way I like it. Hash browns and over easy eggs! Fresh squeezed oj! Perfect breakfast! Super friendly service!!"}
{"text":"Food excellent service eh could be improved that's why only 4 stars. For the gobbler very good, turkey sausage, Spinach, potatoes and 3 eggs. Staff seems new, very disorganized, told us to sit anywhere then thought we were already there o would recommend siting each table to know more what's going on, for our part we had 3 different servers help us and had no idea what was going on. Each server should probably have a section and stick to it.

Will be back and hopefully a better experience"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here! The server was friendly, funny and made it an entertaining evening for me and my friend. I ordered the benny with the amazing peanut butter pancake treat. It was literally like a dessert. The best pancake Ive had in a very long time. So good, that I have to come back soon because Ive been having a craving for it since then lol Thank you!"}
{"text":"Good food, staff is cool , don't wear your good clothes you'll come out smelling like food but overall I would recommend this spot for some good breakfast and pancakes"}
{"text":"So I've been hearing commercials and seen good reviews for this place that's in our neighborhood, and wanted to give it a try. I got some friends to go with us.
There was a little bit of a wait but not too bad, it was a Sunday morning after all.
Staff we encountered were nice and friendly.
I ordered the Mexican Huevos (9.99) Tortilla topped with chopped Steak, Onion, Green Pepper & Cheese with 3 Eggs. I can't recall what anyone else ordered but my husband got a Single Stack Coconut Pancake (3.99) to try. The Coconut Pancake was huge, I liked it, I would go back for another pancake. But my Huevos weren't all that. The portion was huge! Gigantic soft tortilla with all the stuff on top of it. It was okay just nothing special, the steak lacked seasoning. I would think if it's called Mexican it would have some spice or heat but unfortunately it didn't. It was all rather bland.
Everyone else at the table seemed to feel the same about their meals. Bummer.
I'd give it another try but with all the breakfast joints around it may take awhile."}
{"text":"I ordered gluten free waffles and they assured me it was gluten free and brought out regular waffles that made me very sick. They lied about my order and made me feel like I was wrong when they are the ones who brought out the wrong order. If you have CELIACS DISEASE DO NOT COME HERE!"}
{"text":"You lost a life long customer. 2 Stars only due to the history. 

Let me preface this by saying I used to ride my bike to this place when I was young - back when it was called Mollies Kountry Cafe. This has been one of my favorite places my whole life. Home style food, friendly service, good prices. I loved it. I've always recommended it to people and even hyped it up about the family ownership.

Its a very long drive for me now but I still like to go there every now and then.

I watched the change to Griddlecakes a few years back, and that was fine fine. Not a whole lot changed. But now they seem to have completely transformed into \"stacks and yolks\" with an aim at catering towards the \"hip\" crowd, I guess. I know pancakes are trendy at the moment and for the first time, the place is frequently packed. Good for them, but it wont last if they keep this up.

The food and service are terrible, however. Maybe I'm just biased because I know how it used to be, but I've never had a more MEH experience at any restaurant. The gravy, like most of the other food, is no longer home made but ordered from Sysco or whomever as \"heat and eat\" bags. This place is aiming at the lowest common denominator at the expense of its long time customers. Hey, I guess lots of people like Applebees and TGI Fridays type food. Maybe that will work out for them, but I doubt it.

After a 1+ hour wait and extremely bland food which my wife and I hardly ate, I told the owner about my disappointment during check out. I wasn't rude, just honest. He gave me a half-hearted apology and sent me on my way. He didn't ask what we ate or who our server was. Didn't offer any sort of discount. I even explained my history with the place. He just didn't give a crap.

Its obvious that the ownership doesn't care about whats happening. They are just trying to cash in on a new trend while hipsters take pictures of their pancakes - and they will be gone once that fad dies out.

You dun goofed, Mollies. You dun goofed."}
{"text":"I went with a coworker during the week. There was one cook and one guy serving and taking orders and seating people. Needless to say the service suffered when the place only had 2 other tables of people. The food is what really disappointed. My friend ordered the corned beef and it looked disgusting. The portion size was so small it was insulting. Were they running out of corned beef? Aside from that the dish itself looked like stringy lunch meat chopped and over cooked then tossed with some bell peppers and potatoes. By the time we left another server had come in to work and things seemed less hectic yet we still had to wait 10+ minutes to get our check. We probably would've have waited even longer had we not just walked up to the register asked for it."}
{"text":"They get very busy and when they do they scramble to make it work. The service gets noticeably worse as they get busier which seems obvious but great restaurants don't make you feel that way. The owner is very friendly and always does his best to make things right.

The reason I can't give S&Y more than 3 stars is that something always goes wrong. The last visit our food must have been sitting quite a while as everything came out cold. One dish was so cold it wasn't edible. The sad thing is that when your food comes out correct and warm it is great. The pancakes are worth a visit. We just always feel like we are rolling the dice everytime we head over there."}
{"text":"My first time, ordered food to go.  Food was fabulous, timing for pick up was exact, but when we went to eat there was one set of plastic ware for 2 meals????? One of us is suppose to use our fingers?  Asked for sugar free syrup which we got, but no regular syrup.  It is expensive.  So overall the experience is as just mediocre."}
{"text":"Breakfast is not hard to mess up, and what can I say about it that hasn't been said before, scrambled eggs were great, bacon crisp, country potatos good!

My husband got the special cornbeef hash, it was good, had red peppers in it, moist, but he was disappointed in the portion, despite the eggs, potatos and biscuit. 

We did add a 1/2 stack buttermilk pancakes and they were ver good, warm syrup!

Good service and good food."}
{"text":"Great food.  California Benedict was great.  Poached to perfection.  Cool Sat am.  Busy place.  Don't sit near the door unless you have a ponytail.  But if that is the worst I can say..  we will be back.
Love the decor."}
{"text":"The food was good, with the exception of the eggs I had to send back, once it finally came out. Three tables that sat and ordered after we did were half way done eating before our order came out. We didn't have a large group, 5 people. 
I ordered the Elvis - bacon stuffed peanut butter pancakes topped with bananas. Eggs and sausage on the side. The pancake was BOMB!! I HATE sending food back but the scrambled eggs looked inedible. I flipped them over and the bottom was gray. Ugh!
When the waitress let us know they were \"putting our order together\" I pointed out the other tables getting their food before us. I was polite but still pissed. Jessica was super sweet not sure who screwed that up.. the food was good enough for me to want to eat here again. I think I'd be happier calling ahead and ordering food to go."}
{"text":"Food just was not prepared as we remembered.  Service was also not good today. Then the bathroom was filthy...no paper towels either :(. So disappointed.  I also don't like to be asked if I want something and I have to ask of there is an extra charge. Don't think we will be back as there are so many other breakfast places to eat at.  We live in the area and try to give our business to places nearby but this just was not good.  A little clean up is also in order."}
{"text":"I personally didn't like the pancakes. I ordered the cinnamon single stack with bacon and eggs. The pancakes weren't warm and they're a bit rough, like hard. I like mine warm and fluffy. Their eggs and bacon were good, bacon wasn't warm tho, everything was basically almost cold. And I think they're over priced. But, the customer service was very friendly."}
{"text":"I drive by this restaurant everyday decided to stop in with my girlfriend. We were both glad that we did the French toast was amazing and the steak skillet special was delicious!"}
{"text":"Had my first trip to Stacks & Yolks today. No complaints even though they were very busy and short staffed everything went smooth. Awesome food and great prices! Had a cheat day here on my diet. The pumpkin November pancakes are great. Added a side of eggs and bacon for $2.99."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place two stars because the restaurant looked great and the food smelled delicious! .... If only we were greeted and given a menu!!!  We walked in and was quickly told by their only server, to find a seat anywhere, no HELLO, no GREETING, just FIND A SEAT.. but it was cool with me, he looked busy and I can understand because I've waited tables myself for 10 years.  So giving the restaurant and this server the benefit of the doubt, my husband and I sat down and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited patiently, until 10 minutes went by and another table that came in after us, was seated and given menus!!! That's when my patience ran out and I walked up to the person at the counter asking for a manager.  He said there was no manager available, at which point the only server came by and said, \"I'll be right with you guys\".. no SORRY, no APOLOGY, just \"I'm gonna be right with you guys\" .. I told the server I've been here for 10 minutes waiting patiently for anyone to greet us, say hello, and at least give us a menu.  The server pointed to the busser, rolled his eyes and said she was supposed  to do that, that's her job.. He said, we're really busy, to which I told him that was no excuse to completely ignore someone that he himself noticed when we walked in and told us to have a seat.  I said, we're just gonna go, to which he sarcastically responded, \"BYE!\" .. I wonder how many other customers they treat this way, when there isn't a manager on staff to hold them accountable?"}
{"text":"I ordered the garden skillet and the bell pepper was raw, it had minimal cheese, it had no flavor, no seasoning. My husband got the corn beef hash which the waitress did not approve of and make an extremely disgusted face. Not really the best sales technique insulting the customers choice just because it's not your personal favorite. They told my brother in law they were out of the dish he selected 20mins after he ordered it. So he decided to go with the corn beef hash as well. It looked like they split my husbands corn beef hash into 2 very small orders in order to cover their mistake. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Second time here and no better than when this location initially opened.  High priced for basic meat, eggs, bread.  Ordered hamand eggs for $10.99, I got a sliver of a slice of ham that may have been on the flat top 10 seconds because it was so thin and to top it off, it was only half a slice of ham!!!  Food also arrived at room temp.  Saw server all over the place and after he brought our food the next time he came to our table was to bring the check!  Your better off sticking to their high priced flavored pancakes.  My granddaughter liked her red velvet pancakes or I would have rated them a 1"}
{"text":"My first time eating here , the servers were friendly but neither one introduce or say their names . We order grill cheese  that took almost 40 min to get out ,instead of fries I order fruit . Well the fruit was old how can you serve old stuff , not good at all need a lot of improvement."}
{"text":"Stacks and Yolks provides nothing short of exceptional service. Fred is a gem and provides excellent recommendations. Try the Always November pancakes!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident and decided to give it a shot. Great place with great staff. We will be back for sure but the downside..NO MILITARY DISCOUNT!!"}
{"text":"(finally get to review this one!) WE LOVE THIS PLACE! my bf and i are regulars here. we are so happy when their business hours changed (they're open til 9PM now!) we've been coming here fr the past 2 years and it's always a fun experience!!!

we usually do brunch because breakfast on a weekend is just too crazy lol but truthfully, every time we come and there's a line, the longest we had to wait was 15mins! (they're fast!!!) my bf usually get the CHICKEN PESTO MELT and boooy, it's bomb!!! chicken is juicy! i personally love the MEXICAN HUEVOS!!! it's just heaven for me! we also both love their FRENCH TOAST!! i can't even explain, it's melt-in-your mouth!! pancakes are always bomb! BIG AND FLUFFY! we love the buttermilk, it's a classic!

the servers are always nice, happy and smiling! they love to feed us! lol it's just a perfect place for breakfast or brunch. the atmosphere is just very upbeat,the interior is colorful. we love this place! definitely a must-try!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I tried this because they were on Fox 5.  It was ok, but my omelet was overcooked and sat it sat out on the counter for sometime before it came to our table.  Service was slow, but everyone was nice.  The BATHROOM was FILTHY!  Yuck!!  We won't be back!"}
{"text":"When visiting family,love to go out for a good breakfast or lunch.  Grand kids were fussy and daughter,Clair and I pulled in to the nearest spot. The Family Food Gods were looking out for us!!!
 Great chicken salad(I'll have what she is eating). Kids had KIDS MENU items(they ate it all) and Clair had a salad too.  Food was great ,price was great,BUT the service was the BEST.  We were welcomed when we came in,even thought it was busy.  we were given our drinks right away and then greeted by the owner to take our order. He(sorry I forgot his name) was so endearing to my family and made the dinning very enjoyable. We went back the next morning for their Fabulous pancakes.  The orange cranberry being my favorite,Clair's the buckwheat( I ate those while pregnant with her) and the kids ate the chocolate whip cream happy face pancakes. I even ordered Pancakes to go!!!!
  WE WILL BE BACK."}
{"text":"There is a time when the price you are charged gives an expectation for quality service and quality food. But stacks and yolks isn't a place of good value or good taste. The servers aren't very nice. They slightly got my order wrong forgetting spinach. But then they brought it out to me for a fee. Orange juice will give you sticker shock, $3.99 for what they call large, which is smaller than a coffee mug"}
{"text":"It's too far for us, but wanted to try it because it was central with the friends we met up with. Nonetheless, we enjoyed our brunch"}
{"text":"I'm used to waiting a long time when I come here but this was unacceptable. First everything we tried to order they were out of. Then the waitress gave suggestions of things clearly nobody orders. Then when we finally find something appealing that they have, it takes over 45min to arrive. No apologies or anything whatsoever, just \"uuuhhhhhh I'll check on it\" from our waitress and the cooks that we spoke to directly."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, decent food. Pricier than I'd like for breakfast, but they do have fresh squeezed orange juice, amazing hot chocolate and flavored pancakes. We had corned beef hash and a philly skillet. Very tasty. Portions weren't bad, but still a little more than I like spending on breakfast."}
{"text":"Big plates, good service & tasty food. What more could you ask for! She had an omelette, bacon & home fries...she crushed them! I had the protein pancakes, eggs & link sausage. A note of caution: a single stack covers the WHOLE plate & is about a half to three quarters inch thick! Yum! Next time I'm ordering a single stack, that's plenty for me. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I have come here so many times. Even before hey we're called Stacks and Yolks. This is the place I always go to when I want a great breakfast in a cozy environment. Pancake are amazing and their eggs are tasty. I will always return."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service. We waited for our table for about 20 minutes (which isn't a problem). But then had to wait over an hour for our food. 

Our server didn't come to take our order for about 20 minutes and then our order was lost and we proceeded to wait for almost an hour before they realized they didn't have our tickets. I asked if we could have a discount because of the wait and I was told that they'd have to call the owners and that they couldn't do that. No discount was given. 

Just a poor service is all"}
{"text":"Great experience love the food got to try the lips pancakes! Everything we got was delicious. The only reason i put 4 stars is because it is far and pretty small lol they should open a bigger location"}
{"text":"First timer here ... got the Philly Skillet (with no cheese for me) but it was yummy !!! Most of the staff is fairly new but they are so nice and constantly checking on how you're doing and refilling coffee and water.  Owner has a great personality and makes you feel super welcomed.  Oh and he's friends with TJ Lavin so you might see him around.  Started my Sunday morning with breakfast and a great atmosphere ... Why not start your day here ??? Thanks StacksandYolks !!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast we have had in Vegas! We come here every year when we come to Vegas! Great service and our server Brandon was extremely nice! We will always be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! So much better than other breakfast places. Came here with my mom. We had the meat lovers scramble, California eggs Benedict, and one buttermilk pancake. Best pancake I've ever had and it was huge!! Great service too. Highly recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and friendly staff.  The Cali eggs Benedict was delicious.  Tri-tip on the steak and eggs was tough, but it was a huge portion."}
{"text":"This place should be closed down, horrible service, even worse food. No air conditioning. 
Not worth the 10 minute wait. Ordered the Marinated Steak Tips, tasted like it had been reheated at least 4 times in the micro-waved. Couldn't even chew the meat. The pancakes were burnt. Just a Horrible experience. Not worth the $ 46.00. They should be ashamed."}
{"text":"Good food. So many choices. A little wait on a Saturday morning but worth it. Come hungry."}
{"text":"Wow. I don't know what happened here, but this place will never see my business again. The owner is a POS. 

We have come here many times, and everything was always perfect. Today we came and we noticed right off the bat the place was half empty, and there was still a 10 minute wait. People were visibly upset outside, having waited forever for their bills. But we still sat. Bad idea. 

Firstly there were three tables that were seated after we ordered that received their food before we did. Then half of my husbands order didn't show. Or so we thought. Turns out I had my husbands food, and when I took a bite I nearly died because jalapeño and I don't mix and it was not regular bacon like I had ordered. 

Finally the waitress came by and when I said I didn't have my food, and there was a mix up, she didn't know what to do. She immediately put the blame on the kitchen, which ok. But then she made no effort to even get my food. 

Then my husbands pancake, and my daughters were mixed up. Like, this isn't hard. One has sprinkles baked into it and the other doesn't. 

So now we finally ask for the manager because honestly, this is unacceptable. There isn't even a manager, but the owner happened to be there. The man had the nerve to walk out of his own restaurant with a kid and a bunch of to go bags. Couldn't be bothered to even apologize for the mix up or anything. 

And the topping is he told the waitress to give us 20% off MY FOOD THAT I DIDNT EVEN HAVE. Not the bill, my non existent food. 

So yeah. Fuck this guy and fuck this place. Never getting my business again since he fired his whole staff that knew what they were doing to probably save his cheap ass a couple of bucks."}
{"text":"Bright, welcoming walls! Excellent Belgian waffle! Friendly server! Happy to have one in the NW!"}
{"text":"We went for a late breakfast during winter break, and they were still pretty packed, so these guys must be doing something right. Unfortunately, it's not the yolks. I ordered a skillet breakfast with over easy eggs. Three eggs come with the skillet, and one was over easy, the second over medium, and the third over hard. :/  I really expect more from a breakfast joint; even Denny's gets my eggs right.
Hubs ordered the Alabama Slamma pancakes, and those were tasty. The biscuits and gravy side was meh, too. The gravy has very little sausage flavor. Stick to their stacks and skip the yolks.
All in all, we are unlikely to return. There are just to many better options in this area.
Pros: wide menu selection, good service for coffee refills (our mugs were never empty), cute decor
Cons: Eggs not prepared as ordered, our server never returned to check on us (so I couldn't even say anything to her), half the restaurant gets blasted with outside air every time door opens.
Overall: we'll pass"}
{"text":"I went to this place and I dissatisfied. The service was entirely too slow. The waiters there were rude when we asked for our order to be taken. We waited an hour and a half for 3 meals. When we finally got the meal everything was drenched in oil. The omelet was not an omelet, it was a yellow slob in a puddle of oil. I didn't enjoy any of the food due to the over amount of oil. I ended up paying and just leaving. I left unsatisfied and hungry."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum! The food here is very yummy. Recommend The Lips if you're a fan of Red Velvet. I was ecstatic to see a meal option with turkey sausage, so I ended up having the Great Gobbler. The service was great. Only downside was the restaurant could've been a little cleaner (slippery floors that felt like they needed a good scrubbing), but I say meh to that in the grand scheme of things. Yay to my new breakfast spot :)"}
{"text":"Found this breakfast place close to my neighborhood. The service started off slow but was much better during my breakfast of ham, egg, cheese on an English muffin. Potatoes were uneventful and rather bland. Coffee was better than most breakfast places. Never got a spoon. The place was packed on a Monday morning. Overall, it was just \"OK\"."}
{"text":"I normally LOVE this place but after today's experience I'm very disappointed. My husband and I went in, sat down, got our drinks and ordered in the first 5min everything was going smoothly. This was great because I only had an hour. They weren't busy no wait. However we waited. They came over to the table after about 20min after ordering and dropped out check. I said \"we haven't gotten out food yet\". The girl said sorry we forgot to send it in and that she would rush it. Two more times we had this talk and at the end of the hour still no even started on our food. We went up to say we are out and they said...ok, bye. I'm big on customer service since that's my job and this here was a lack of paying attention and making it right. They should've been all over this. Making it worse we sat right in front of her the whole time. Not like we were tucked away in a corner.  Makes me want reconsider where I spend my time and money."}
{"text":"I'm not one to leave bad reviews even if I have had a horrible experience but I feel compelled to do so after dining here. 

Terrible service. It took forever to get someone to take our order and for our food to arrive. I saw it sitting in the kitchen window for quite some time, and then it was moved to the serving counter for a long time. About two or three servers passed by the counter and just let it sit there. It was cold by the time it landed on our table. My bf ordered a breakfast burrito with added sour cream. No sour cream and it was really greasy. He couldn't even finish it. My pancakes were cold and hard. If we had received some kind of niceties from the staff it would have made our experience a little less sour!

Sucks because I had high hopes for this place!"}
{"text":"Super excited to try this place but highly disappointed. 
1) Prices online do not match the prices in the restaurant. 
2) I ordered the Coconut batter single stack with chocolate chips and my Husband ordered the Orange Cranberry batter single stack with whipped cream cheese. 
This order was \"to go\" and when we returned home we found the pancakes were reversed! 
3) I called at 1:12p and asked to speak with a Manager and there was none but that he would be back later. WHAT!? He completely lied to me because they close at 3:00p. 
Food was would have been great if they only focused on the order placed. No reason to go back when there's so many other breakfast options here in Las Vegas. 

Update: 3 days and still no return phone call. What a joke."}
{"text":"came here for the first time a couple weeks ago and i thought the food was pretty damn good! but 4 stars (3 stars really) because the time it took to get our food took way too long and our server kinda sucked. dude took ten minutes to come take our drink order and when he returned he brought the wrong drinks. like c'mon it wasn't that hard to remember a few drinks. quit wakin n' bakin before work lol. also he was a little rude too, plus never stopped by to see how we were doing once either. anyway like i said the food was excellent and portions were good too. it's just the service that put me in a bad mood too early in the day."}
{"text":"The food and pancakes are not good. Food is expensive and service is just ok. Went back after first time, didn't like it the first time or second."}
{"text":"When I visit vegas to see my brother and sister in law, they alway take me to the most amazing breakfast places... (I heart breakfast with a passion) This visit tops the list in yummy b'fast joints I have had the privilege to eat! 

We dined on Christmas Day and was pleasantly happy to know this restaurant was open. The decor was great and the staff was super friendly. We were offered the booth in the back and happily followed the server to our dining spot. 

Things started out terrific, ordered a cup of coffee  and tried to figure out what yumminess I will partake as my entree this morning. Well, it was early and I need as much coffee as I can physically engulf in one sitting... I finished my first cup and it took forever to get a refill (and equally a while for someone to take our order.) I had to ask someone for a refill but it still took a while for them to fill my cup, I ask my brother if he would be mad if I just got up and filled up myself, I mean the coffee pot was only a few steps away, but finally someone came by and filled my cup... (They may of heard me talking about really needing a refill... don't mess with someone who needs coffee to function early in the morning) It's a simple request and don't know why it took so long? I may of been more annoyed seeing everyone else get a refill or getting beverage while I waited for a while? Or maybe the restaurant started filling up? Or maybe the orders for food all started to pile up... It's dumb I know, but it was kinda annoying... Either have bigger cups or keep the caffeine flowing when you obviously see an empty cup at the end of a table. Just sayin'

Anyways, moving on the the important stuff, THE FOOD! I ordered the cranberry orange pancakes and a single order of French toast... My bro got the steak and eggs and my niece got a single blueberry lemon pancake... Well here's the deal. I pretty much hate pancakes (with a small exception, ahem - mister mcalpine)  many pancakes I taste have a weird starchy taste to them that is unappealing to me... Since this place has such a plethora of options of flavored, I thought why not... Well I had a small portion of nieces lemon blueberry pancake (she's 3 and since the lotions were bigger than MY head I felt obliged to help her out) well, HOLY SMOKES!!! YUM! Very flavorful, fresh and yummy!!! No weird starchy taste!! By far my most fave pancake today... My orange cranberry was good, the orange flavor was subtle but equally d'lish... It was filled with cranberries and a glaze that was simply fantastic! 

I think once the staff got things back in order everything went back to normal and they were attentive and helpful.... 

If you have a chance to try this delicious establishment- go do it!!! 

You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"All i gotta say.. Churro style french toast... jesus effing holy jack and the giant beanstalk beans and christ. I am pretty sure churro styled french toast, along with the 1/2 lb of butter AND the maple syrup and the egg whites (gotta watch the cholesterol) with bacon, that meal was easily 3000 calories of goodness.

After three bites I felt like my mouth had been transported to a place that had unicorns making love to dolphins surfing a rainbow to the leprechauns gold. After a few hours though, I did notice a rather strong reaction starting to rise in my body. No matter what pain I suffered afterwards... just those moments where my tastebuds were transported to the land of make believe, it was worth it. And the server/host dude was awesome, always had a smile, talked witht he patrons, made everyone feel good. Would definitely go there again, this time though, I will not have the churro styled french toast. I do not think I could replicate that feeling and if I tried, i would be disappointed.

Anyone disagreeing with me or putting down less than 4 stars, they obviously just needed to find something to pick at and whine about.. eff them..."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot every time we leave Vegas. That might have to change. Today was horrible. First off we were told a 20 min wait and it was more like 40. The menus were filthy as were the metal tables we were sat at outside. We had to as for place settings, salt, pepper, creamer, hot sauce and never got our water. We had 3 different servers ask us if we had had our order taken yet. Organized much? My red velvet pancakes had to be sent back because we got out food literally like 5 mins after we ordered which great they're fast but my pancakes weren't cooked all the way through. During our rushed 20 min meal we were asked about 15 times if we needed anything else. Yes,,, let me eat!!!! And water. Which we never got from any of the 6 people who asked. I understand it's Sunday and having worked at a busy restaurant I understand to a degree. The nasty ass menus at 9AM NO! They should all be wiped down the night before. The disorganization was insane. Aside from my under cooked pancakes the food was fine. I'm sure we can find some place else to enjoy our pre drive home breakfast."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service! Delicious pancakes. Will definitely go back when I'm craving pancakes. I liked their pancakes better than baby stacks, and the whipped butter(margarine) they use is to die for!"}
{"text":"Since this is my fourth time dining here, I think it is time for a review! I love this place all around. I love the hearty breakfast they serve along with the good service they provide. The environment is like an old friends house and you can sit for hours talking and laughing with your friends. Their menu is big and offers a pretty wide variety on what you can order and they specialize in unique pancakes and skillets. I don't think you can go wrong on anything you order as I only see smiling faces chowing down at this restaurant. The portions are also pretty big so you leave feeling fat and happy! You need to get here at an early hour though as this place does fill up fast on the weekends. They also have two locations. I prefer the one on Durango as closer to where I live but there is another one in the northwest part of town.

I am pretty standard on what I order which is usually bacon, eggs, sourdough toast and an OJ or hot chocolate depending on what time of year it is. On this occasion I was doing with one of my besties. She ordered the traditional Eggs Benedict and we shared a delicious pancake. The pancake was fluffy and not heavy like pancakes can be at times. She really enjoyed her Eggs Benedict and told me the cream sauce was very rich yet spot on! 

Stacks and Yolks, you are the sunshine of my Saturday mornings! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Just came and ordered the Lumberjacks Special with lemon blueberry pancakes and a side of Kit Corned beef and hash. 

Unfortunately, the Buser threw away my leftover corn beef and hash he was supposed to box up for me. He

When I asked why he apologized and said he would have them make another order for me. 

I was then told by the waitress that the owner had come in and refused to honor what I was promised. I was told that if I still wanted it I would have to pay for the full order. 

Needless to say I will not be back, with this kind of customer service it's obvious why their not doing as well as the other location. 

To that end the food quality also suffers the same lesser degree of quality and taste. I would advise you stick with the location off Durango."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and while the food has always been good, the service is terrible! Today, I needed a work meeting catered for breakfast and I thought I'd give them a shot. I called on Sunday at 9am and was told the owner would call me back to place the order. At 6pm, I hadn't heard from him so I called again. At 7:40pm, he called me and we got the order placed. It was set for a 9am serve time which meant they would arrive at 8:45am. At 9:15, I called because they hadn't arrived. The girl who answered the phone, Mariah, said he already left 20 mins ago. Well, he left AFTER he was already supposed to be at my work, so that makes no sense. At 9:40, he still wasn't there!!! I called and Mariah told me he was lost. Great, was anyone going to communicate that with me? Oh, not to mention, I called the owner twice and asked both of his employees to have him call me and its 8:15pm right now and still no call. So they missed my meeting, the food was cold, the eggs had shells in them and were a greenish gray from sitting too long, and the bacon had hair in it. How do you mess up customer service when all you have to do is deliver it?! Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Best biscuits and gravey I ever had.  Sandwiches where so good.  Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Wait was only 15 minutes which was cool. The floor was a little dirty but had people cleaning up as they went. Food is always great and as always... Satisfied."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! Whatever you do, don't not come here. First off the food is disgusting and way over priced. My boyfriend ordered the meat loves scramble and the potatoes were under cooked and all the eggs and meat was burnt. I ordered a full stack of regular pancakes. The runner went to the next table with our food, which was were the owner was sitting at just talking while it's super busy and it looked like they were under staffed. I finally got my pancakes and they were raw, now keep in mind is that I am 9 months pregnant. I could literally smell the raw batter, I tell the sever and they proceed to get me a new plate and again, UNDERCOOKED. Not to mention the owner's whole family was in there with two small children under the age of 2 and they were just walking in and out of the kitchen, getting their food before anyone else. And the two children were running in the kitchen, in front of servers that had their hands full of food. I just thought it was really unprofessional to have their whole family in there while their restaurant is literally drowning and their just talking it up and eating before anyone else."}
{"text":"We have dined here for breakfast twice in the last month and both times have experienced nice friendly service and good quality food.  We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Amazing service and even better food. We never had to ask for drink refills, they were on top of service. We ordered the Birthday Cake pancakes and Fruity Pebble French Toast. The serving sizes were huge and the food was delicious. We will be back again for sure.  I highly recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"I truly wanted to like this place due to my need to support small businesses.  My daughter wanted pancakes, so I set out on a short journey to satisfy her craving.  Pancakes were huge, which would not be bad if the pancakes were good.  Food and service were ok, not horrible but ok.  

I probably would have given this place two stars for the above mentioned but as I was paying our bill, I was able to watch an older woman (possibly owner) appear extremely busy in the kitchen with her HAIR DOWN, no pony tail, no bun, no hairnet just lots of free flowing hair??????. If I would have witnessed that site when I walked in, I would have walked right out."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst breakfast place ever. The food was served ice cold... to the point that our cheese wasn't even melted on the eggs- anyone like black burnt toast? No- me either! It might as well have been thrown at me. It was as if the waiter was having the worst day of his life. The owner had his entire tribe of screaming children running around the entire restaurant disrupting paying customers. We had two orders of the Mexican huevos- the steak was ice cold. We skillet came out piping hot, but wasn't made as it was listed on the menu. No feta cheese. My sour dough toast looked like toasted rye bread. 

We made our complaints to the waiter and he went to speak with the manager, came back, three us the tab and said \"I got you 20% off but that's all I can\", as if we wanted something for free.. we just wanted our food to be offered to be heated at the very least and maybe fresh toast? 

I'm not one to post reviews I was just literally THAT bothered by it. When I paid the tab the OWNER said- \"sorry about that\". Nothing further. DO NOT GO THERE AND WASTE YOUR MONEY."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended as a break from the traditional \"Egg Works\" Mecca most make in Vegas. Hopes were high even though yelp showed up with 3.5 stars (ehhh. Whatcha gonna do?). We showed up and were greeted and sat immediately (early morning before the rush) and given drinks. Once we ordered though, it was all downhill from there. The service went from friendly to nonexistent, the food took a considerably long time to come out and drinks often times ended up drier than the desert dunes across the road before a refill was even conceived. My order came out incorrect but there wasn't anyone to let know about this (as they were off doing their own thing without concern) and frankly it would have taken twice as long to get it corrected - not worth it. The waitress eventually came by and asked if we wanted the check, which we gratefully requested so we could get out of there, though we asked for more water - you'd have thought I sold her firstborn to the gypsies. She took our card, I asked again about water and she decided not to acknowledge or respond. I was happy to eventually get my card back after 5-7 minutes (I don't care to have someone else keep my card laying around on the counter for that long) and then leave. It'll be back to egg works for me - even with all the tourist crowds and stupid long wait times."}
{"text":"Big plates & definitely worth the price. Their fresh squeezed orange juice is delicious. Lots of different pancake flavors and combination. 

It's 15 min away from the MGM but worth the drive since everything on the strip is over priced."}
{"text":"Great off strip place to have breakfast. Good service and a great way to start the am. The pancakes there were light and fluffy and the omelettes were"}
{"text":"Had a late breakfast here today around 11am with my husband. The pancakes here are really good and the toppings are fresh. I made sure to confirm the strawberries were real and fresh and not that premade sauce. I also had an add on of bacon and eggs which were great too. Our server, a young gentleman was very attentive and so was the young lady bussing the tables. During the weekend they are so busy,  but this am we didn't have to wait. This was our second visit and will very likely return."}
{"text":"****Update 2/4/15
I knew when I saw how busy it was we should've left. We were sitting at our table, when we were asked to get up because the table had been cleared by mistake. There's no waiting room inside, so we had to then wait outside for something to open up. I'm pretty easy going so no problem. 
We were seated in a booth in the back of the restaurant, where it seemed we were forgotten. We got water after 10min or so. Then another 10min later we got some of the worst coffee ever. Eventually we saw out actual server who took our order and apologized for the wait. 
So then we waited and waited for food and new coffee. The server brought food to the table....but it wasn't anything that we ordered. So it went back and we waited again. 
We got our food. My son was happy with his smiley face pancake. Hubby said the formerly awesome breakfast burrito was just ok and had to be drowned in cholula for flavor. I got the Country Combo. Scrambled eggs, bland potatoes, and a biscuit with a single sausage patty laying on top with some packet style \"country \" gravy. It was so sad. All that trouble for a less than mediocre breakfast. I had the Country Combo before and it was amazing. Sorry Stacks. I like to support local business, but you have lots of competition out there that blows you away. If I get a hankering for a specialty pancake, I might be back. 

***********************************
I've been here maybe 5 times. The food is always great. The servers are very nice. When it gets busy, it can take awhile to get your food. I've tried a few different variations of pancakes. Lemon cake with blueberries was good. The Always November (pumpkin with cream cheese and whipped cream)  is to die for. Coffee is great. I've also had their biscuits and gravy. Quite yummy. Their breakfast burrito has grilled onions in it and is delicious! Give them a try!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The staff was wonderful and attentive. The girl at the front door even offered us coffee while we were waiting for a table. Best customer service I have experienced in a long time. The food... Was great and piping hot! I would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"The last time I ate there we ordered pancakes they were super dry you couldn't even get them moist with syrup complain to all waitress who talked to the manager who only offered to replace them with waffles. Will never return there again. If you want pancakes or breakfast just go down the street to Buffalo to babystacks that would be your best self."}
{"text":"There was a wait but the food was worth of it. The waiter was funny and attentive and completely made us forget how long we waited. The food was amazing! So good. It also was enough to feed 2 people. The jalapeño bacon alone would make me come back over and over again."}
{"text":"Friendly service! Love all the girls that work here. The owner alway has a smile. Pancakes taste floury but eggs and sides are good."}
{"text":"Makes Denny's look fabulous. Check out the putrid new color of their building - that should be enough to keep you out of this establishment. The food is well cooked, but has the flavors of so many different things it is hard to distinguish what exactly you are eating - I don't even want to see the kitchen!"}
{"text":"When I was pregnant, The Griddle was my go to stop after my dr.'s visits. After a few years i noticed it changed to Stacks and Yolks, but had the same owner. Finally had a chance to stop in. It was way busier than before, waited about 15-20minutes. It is worth the wait because this place never disappoints. 

I love the Arizona Skillet!!!! Seasoned Ground Beef, Green Pepper, Jalapeño, Onion over Home Fries with Cheese....I want it again just thinking about it."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat! Stack and Yolks located on Durango near the 215 is a great fun breakfast anytime of the day place.
The restaurant is a little small and its also fairly popular so be prepared to wait if you hit it during peak hours but that's okay because the food is great and worth it.

The Red Velvet Pancakes are awesome! of course the Yolks are made basically anyway you can think of with options of getting Egg Whites only. They do serve lunch items, salads, burgers, fries, wraps, and sandwich's but I have only eaten breakfast here.

This day I had the red velvet pancakes and the Griddle Platter and it was super great, how can you go wrong with Chicken, Spinach, Mushroom and Feta Cheese over Home Fries with 3 Eggs any style. Served with Pita Bread! 

Coffee is pretty standard with no fancy selections here. They do offer a Gluten Free Menu for those that need no gluten although there is only about 6 items on it but certainly enough to satisfy. 

Parking is in a shared lot with other business so that could be a challenge depending on the time of day you go. 

Overall, I the cost is great and the service has been on point even when its busy. Although one time of my coffee refills was slow to come but this time its was like every 2 minutes! 

I cannot wait to eat some more pancakes!"}
{"text":"Ordered crab cakes Benedict. I love crab cakes and I love hollandaise sauce, but both were subpar. Crab cakes seemed like they were frozen at one time and the hollandaise sauce seemed like it was reconstituted from a powder packet. Stick with the stacks and yolks."}
{"text":"This place rocks!! Fast and fun service, Brandon was awesome and had a fun personality. Food was amazing and good portions. I love that they even offer a military discount, not because the discount itself, but the fact that they appreciate the military."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that the pancakes are huge! I just think that the quality of food was okay. It was busy and I get it, but we didn't have enough utensils for our food. We had to ask 3 different servers for utensils and by the time they brought the utensils, some if not most of our food was cold. 

One of my friends had a broken a cracked cup around the top area. What if the piece of glass fell inside the cup? That could have caused some harm. I understand your not going to catch everything but I think that's something they should've caught.

Overall the food was okay nothing special, the servers were nice but they forgot all of our requests like can you get us some utensils, can you get us an extra plate, some napkins please, etc. I usually try places twice but I'm probably won't be back to this one."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I enjoy the Nutella pancakes and the hot chocolate and the bacon. Mmmmm it is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Vegas Yelpers!

I'm always on a hunt for red velvet pancakes!

Came here the other day with my boys Supercr3w/Jabbawockeez for Rainen's birthday breakfast. They are good friends with the owner Baja. Baja is super friendly and took really good care of us.

This is a hard review because the owner was amazing nice... but the red velvet pancakes... didn't pass my approval!

I ordered the red velvet pancakes... with egg whites, chicken sausage and potatoes. I didn't care for their version of red velvet pancakes! I was bummed out and only ate a quarter of it. Something was missing in their recipe... I had better. My friends cousin also didn't like her order of red velvet pancakes... and only took a bite of it. The rest of my breakfast was doable... hard to mess up right?!

I won't be back unless it's with the boys... if so I'll have to try the chocolate pancakes and update my review.

Can't complain... I only paid... tip... Baja took care of us.

As for the red velvet pancakes... Sorry. Fail.

Casual indoor dining. Check it out and lmk what you think."}
{"text":"If the pancakes sucked as bad as the Heavenly Bacon & Eggs then they would get one star...

The Heavenly Bacon and eggs, as they call it was more like a hockey puck, with a side of eggs, and last weeks hashbrowns left in the pan.. no joke!

I won't be coming back.. family of five and not one meal was correct or enjoyable. We have come here for years and the place has gone down the tubes."}
{"text":"Visiting for the weekend and I asked my friend for a good local spot and he recommended this place... 

Long story short, I used to be all about yelping and I was a former Yelp Eliter and just lost interest so for me actually writing a review is a big deal cause I dont care anymore. 


I ordered the hangover cure which was awesome and cooked perfectly with a great smooth black coffee. 

Francesca was our waitress and she was the most personable, bubbly, nice, funny, etc (cue 7272847 more adjectives), by far one of the best I have ever had. 

Other awesome people I had the pleasure to meet was Danni and Brandon, the manager. I had to talk to him and let him know about the greatness of Francesca and Danni 

Not eating here is basically like missing out on life.. dont be a fool."}
{"text":"I gave stack and yolks (jones location) a 1 -star because :

I have heard alot about stack and yolks (south location). My old chef actually told me about this place and hyped it up. So i was expecting beyond the best food, service, etc. So waiting and waiting, finally a location in north las vegas. More convenient for my travel needs. 

Decided to give it a try today (01/21/17) around 10:30am. Walked in. Not much of wait. Probably 10 mins or so with a party of 4 and a party of 2 ahead of us. Which was a disappointment already with dis-organization because they were going to seat us before the couple ahead of us, but we reassured the \"hostess\" that they were there before us. Finally a couple of tables were cleared and ready to be seated. A booth opened up and a table right by the exit door. Was not really excited to sit at the small table for the waiting area bench is literally right next to the table. So we asked for the booth, but unfortunately we were denied because a party of 5 came in while we were waiting for a table and was told they needed to sit there. So i was like okay we will just take it and sit next to the bench. More people walking in, waiting. People waiting were just too close to us. Made us a little uncomfortable because its like they are breathing on you. 

Busser took our drink order, she was very polite. Then the server came maybe 5 mins after and asked if we had ordered drink and we said yes. Asked if we were ready and said yes. So i ordered the HOMEMADE CORNED BEEF HASH, but unfortunately again they had ran out this morning. Only 3 hours into service they ran out and being open for 8 hrs a day they could not have prepped enough? He tells me that they have another corned beef dish. I ask him if its canned, he says yes. Only reason i didnt want canned beef is because they offered HOMEMADE CORNED BEEF. I say okay, i let my girlfriend order while I look at the menu again. She orders the chicken and waffle, our server (gavin) walks away to the kitchen and then come back and tells us that the waffle machine has been out of service since yesterday. So he gives us more time to look over menu. Comes back and i ask him what do you recommend. He recommends all the skillet dishes and so forth. Says they are big portions and they are great. My girlfriend orders the Monterrey skillet and i order the philly skillet. And we decide to share a stack of buttermilk (1).

Id say order was placed at 11am. So time passes by. Look at the clock and its 15 til noon. Thats long for eggs, ive never waited that long on eggs. So we call over our busser and ask her if our food is almost ready. She goes to kitchen and comes back and tells us thats their one more ticket before ours. Say \"okay our food wasnt even started\". Okay. 5 mins pass, we call our server over. Ask about our food, he then goes to the kitchen comes back and tells us its the next ticket. Okay still havent started it??! 5 mins pass we call over the manager/owner/cashier wasn't sure what his position was. Told him we have been waiting nearly an hour for our food. Leaves comes back and tells us our food is up next. Im like what do you mean, we have been told that 2 times and he is like who told you that. I said the busser and our server. He tells me to RELAX and that the kitchen is falling behind because a cook didn't show up. I stopped him there. Its not my business if a cook didnt show up. Its a Saturday morning, you are going to get busy. Schedule to your business needs. As he was standing there our food comes. Its already 11:59. Okay so we go for our food, we've been waiting. And im semi excited at this point because of the hype. Skillet looked nothing like picture. My eggs were cooked OE(just the way i ordered) but then i go for the potatoes. Semi hard, luke warm. No color to it. Dropped on the flat top for a few seconds to warm, thats what it tasted like. My girlfriends food was good. But we didnt get her toast, we had to ask for it but she was halfway done with her meal. Go for my biscuits and gravy, gravy was cold buscuit was luke warm. Gravy had a funny taste. But i ate it because we were hungry. The pancake was okay. Could have ordered a short stack else where  for the same price and better quality. Manager comes over and asked how everything was. I say \"everything was okay\" he says \"okay\" and pats me on the shoulder. I honestly am not one to complain. I rarely complain. But this was just ridiculous. Check is given to us and its pretty much a  40 dollar check. I wouldn't have paid it if it wasnt for us eating most of it. 

I definitely will not return to that location and if people ask me. I will not recommend it.

Maybe ill give the south location a try and hopefully its alot better but usually first impressions have a large effect on my decision."}
{"text":"The service here is really great! The servers are very friendly and have a great energy.

For some odd reason, my husband always gets a club when we go out to breakfast places and he really enjoys the one here. He said it was his second favorite club after the one he gets at Babystacks!

I tried one of their skillets, but I didn't really like it. I suppose I'm just a little used to the skillets at babystacks and how they cook their potatoes. The potatoes here weren't as seasoned or as crispy as I would like. I probably wouldn't get skillets here anymore, but I wouldn't be opposed to trying their waffles or French toast! Because of the service, I would definitely give them another try"}
{"text":"No disappointment here! Second time here place is busy! But they still remembered us!!ask for Freddie! He's a great waiter! Busy guy but great guy! Food is good and portions are huge! Don't miss the menu on the wall try the it's always November!"}
{"text":"Stick to the reviews. Get the \"stacks\". Service was ehh and the food was mediocre. I'll probably not go back again, maybe only for a soda or coffee."}
{"text":"Just okay, nothing special.  Flavor of pancakes saved the review.  I ordered cranberry.  Had a side of bacon and eggs, which were not good.  Very greasy tasting and eggs very dry.
.  Service was poor.  We were there on a weekday at 7 am, only one other couple inside.  Had to ask to take our order and for coffee refill.
They had a few $5. Early bird specials.  Specialty pancakes a bit pricey...$6.99 for a small stack of 2.  Toppings and warm syrup are extra!  Seriously?
Too many breakfast choices out there, not sure if I will be back."}
{"text":"I have nothing but praise for this place. I got the Western Skillet with mushrooms and eggs over easy. It also came with a biscuit and gravy. First the skillet was absolutely delicious!!  Eggs done to perfection. I had to take the biscuit and gravy home and had it for breakfast the next day. The biscuit was so light and tender!!  Wow is all I can say!!  And it was huge!!  Good food and good service. The prices aren't bad either. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Love the food, great service and really like the way its decorated. I try to take my daughter for breakfast at least once a week."}
{"text":"Ok our second time here, they have outside seating so we brought the dog.  The service is ok it's either the kitchen or the severs that are not getting the orders correct.  The coffee is great the fries are amazing and again I usually never order fries.  I had to send my sandwich back and I don't know what they did but it was so hot I burnt my tongue, really?  This only makes me think of a microwave.
I have to say there are so many restaurants in this great city of Las Vegas we will move on."}
{"text":"I treated myself to birthday brunch here on a Monday afternoon, because it's one of the only places in town that served breakfast food not on the weekends. 

I ordered the Elvis, because I was attracted to the bacon filled, peanut butter batter...but I was disappointed.  I wanted the bacon to be super crispy inside the pancake, so it really crunched in my mouth, but instead they were larger, chewier pieces and I felt kinda sick afterwards. It wasn't even a tasty pancake unless I doused it in syrup. 

While my waiter was nice enough, he never refilled my water until he brought me my check. However, I did appreciate his suggestion of only ordering a single stack (cuz them pancakes be real, real big.)  

The prices were decent, and I may come back to try different menu items (like their deep friend french toast or a skillet) but I wasn't overwhelmed by this first visit."}
{"text":"Yummy! Worth the wait if there's a long queue ahead of you. Pancakes are fabulous.  I've tried blueberry-lemon, red velvet and peanut butter-banana so far and I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors soon."}
{"text":"The food was great!!! I got the build your own with Cinnamon Stacks and home fries.... Oh and I got onions, green peppers & sausage added too my eggs!! Let's talk about full lol So much food I have to take a box to go!! (Oh I'm writing the review inside the restaurant) lol #Yummy #Breakfastwithmysister"}
{"text":"The servers looked annoyed and in a rush; they didn't even check if what we ordered cameout okay nor if we needed water refills. The food was super greasy and unsatisfying (the garden skillet was more of a potato skillet).  They literally dropped the check right after we got our food without even asking if we wanted something else. The place is very small and overcrowded."}
{"text":"Super delicious, super clean, great staff, fun and funky comfortable decor, and a wonderful atmosphere. I personally have only been there twice but that is due to time constraints on my side only. This restaurant is so fantastic, that when my wife and I tried it out on a breakfast date we could shut-up about it to our fiends that visited us, several months later. We talked about it so much I could see a few mouths even water at our praise. And when our friends finished their meal they told us our description didn't even do this place justice. 
The portions are big enough to share but I warn you you won't want to (I promise). The prices are decent and my wife can't stop raving about the churro waffle she had. Personally, I had the red velvet pancakes and a carne asada skillet and just thinking about them while right this review feels me with longing and sets my mouth watering so fierce I might drown my phone. 
You will not regret finding this amazing breakfast spot, Breakfast and lunch spot I believe. Food, service, atmosphere, just everything is worth how ever far you need to travel. It is the hidden gem in North-northwest Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Just got back from Stack & Yolks and i rarely write a yelp review. I don't even remember the last time but just got to share this restaurant's bad service. First of they charged us $8.99 for kids meal that is regularly $4.99 which I understand people makes mistakes. They apologized and gave us a corrected receipt. That's when we discovered that they also charged us $2.99 for apple juice when we only ordered water for our son. When we told them abt it, we didn't get a simple \"We're sorry\" just showed us the receipt that they took it out. Almost felt like they didn't believe us. Considering there's 2 mistakes in one receipt, you would think they would be more apologetic, again i'm not asking for any thing special. Just a simple \"we're sorry\" instead, we almost felt like we were hassling them for pointing it out or even worse, making it up. Worst feeling from eating from this establishment. Now i know why this place only has 3 stars. We should've trusted Yelp! Never ever going to this place again!!"}
{"text":"We are big fans.  The food never lets us down and the service has been really good.  I love the grilled chicken salad and my hubby adores the breakfast sandwich done on a bagel.  The kids love the pancakes and waffles.  The Arizona skillet is where it's at!!"}
{"text":"Always had great service till today...  My guest was served a Beef Pattie that was spoiled..You can cook over the smell but you can get rid of a sour taste  or smell when you get to the middle of the pattie. You have to serve fresh meat or people will get SICK!! My guest said don't ever bring him there again. Stomach Spinning..."}
{"text":"Best pancakes ever! Beware though,  they charge for everything.... e.g. a side of ranch, fruit (even if you substitute your fries). The gentleman server is good, the buspeople are cool. Didn't like the broken lip on the glass for my OJ....overall, a good experience though."}
{"text":"I visited the place for the first and last time this morning, with my wife. Her tea was not refilled, and my coffee was undrinkable from some type of contamination. As a restaurant worker, manager of several different restaurants and an owner, I feel more than qualified to state these facts and expect to be respected when I speak. My wife suspects that it was some type of cleaning agent, but that was really my only issue, except for some spoiled orange marmalade that I put on my toast, which was vile and I had to scrape it off of my tongue before I had to taste it anymore. My wife's hash was 90 percent uncooked and straight out of a can. She wouldn't eat it. She said the eggs and hash browns were tasteless. I liked my bacon, eggs and hashbrowns somewhat, but even after asking for BROWN hashed browns, they were blond and unappealing. Fail on the hash browns, and there is no coming back from that. It's all about the hash browns for me. The service was very good, though! They must make something good, since the line is out of the door!"}
{"text":"I had a great brunch with a party of six. The food was tremendous especially the jalapeño bacon. The pancakes were great especially the gluten free pancakes which is something that you rarely get to eat if you're allergic. Service was great especially from Brandon who helped to keep our plates coming on time. An excellent restaurant and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Didn't eat....air conditioner not working. Wanted a half booth half table and guy doing seating acted like it was an imposition because the table hadn't been wiped off.....really?  Your empty tables should always be ready to seat."}
{"text":"This was my first and last visit! It was rude that they brought everyone's food except for mine to the table, then when it got there it had an old grease taste to my strawberry waffle n the chicken wings were terrible! They tasted like frozen store bought wings that were over cooked. That was just the beginning... they never washed their hands from counting money to wiping her hands on her pants,before buttering someone's toast. At this point I was about to lose my stomach, that's when I asked for them to take my plate of un-eat food from the table. They wanted to charge me half the bill  for the bite I took off my plate before I asked for a manager that showed up with an attitude and still charged me 27.00$ for 1 plate that consisted of old hash browns,over cooked eggs, burnt bacon,cold toast and 2 orange juices that's when I was like wtf! 
Never again will I waste my time n money on this trash"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times in 8 months, So I think I have a good opinion of the place. 

Pros - Servers are very attentive and the staff is so nice and friendly. I think they do a great job at working together to take care of the customers. The place looks really nice and the menu is large enough to cover any desire you might have. 

Cons - The food!!!! I ordered the chicken (chicken breast) and waffles. The chicken was sooooo dry. If you order this, get the chicken wings and waffles. Now onto the pancakes. I really didn't like them at all. While they are huge, they are not good at all. The eggs were pretty hard and just plain. 

Conclusion - If you go to Stacks and Yolks, don't order Stacks or Yolks."}
{"text":"This was probably one of my favorite breakfast places that's why I choose it to go celebrate Mother's Day. Worst mistake ever! They were out of orange juice so I opted for my second favorite drink, the hot chocolate and they were out of whipped cream and the chocolate tasted like water. 
By the time my eggs and bacon arrived, they were extremely cold, maybe my waitress forgot about them, so I decided to just canceled my pancakes. 
I ended up eating the left overs from my daughter, which pancakes came cold as well but she was extremely hungry so she didn't care about eating them like that.  
We didn't have silverware and when we asked they apologize and they told us they didn't have any more silverware!!!! So we ate with plastic forks and knives. I'm so disappointed and I definitely won't be going back. They didn't even apologize or tried to make us feel better, so they really lost a loyal costumer."}
{"text":"4 -20-17  COCK ROACH  Warning

Ketchup finger prints on wall and on the booth my wife was in (they looked a few days old hard and stuck to seat)

Then COCK ROACH crawls down wall right over the American flag (if you've eaten there you know what booth we were in) into the condiments onto the table and then under

{"text":"we are regulars at stacks and yolks 4 the past 2 years and the last 2 times we were ignored our food or had to wait 45 minutes because our food was not even written down and the manager blew us off.  the food is ok but service sucks bad. your restaurant has no excuse to treat regulars that way and you have lost 2 great customers who used to recommend your restaurant."}
{"text":"Loveeee stalks and yolks! I go here on the regular  Their skillets are great, and ordering pancakes is a must. Also the chicken and waffles are good!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The best item here is the red velvet pancakes. The variety this place has to offer cant be found anywhere else. Ive tried numerous bfast spots but this one is def one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the ambiance here at this cute breakfast/lunch stop. I've always wanted to try it out and I finally got to! They have a really cool pancake menu on their wall and also have specials of the day! 

My friend and I went with the build your own omelette with toast and a short stack of \"Always November.\" We shared because we felt like we wouldn't be able to finish it and was I right! What a great place to share because their portions are huge!

The omelette was made of egg whites and we pretty much topped it with everything...onions, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes, sausage, ham, and bacon. It was huuuuge and really yummy! Hot and fresh. It also came with home fries (potatoes), and toast. We grabbed the sourdough toast. They were okay, not the best I've had but they were good nonetheless. The pancakes were surprisingly as big as the plate! A short stack came with two and it was a little pricey but we didn't mind. It was pancake batter with whipped cream and cream cheese sauce. Our server suggested adding chocolate chips. It was delicious!! But after a while the pancake had a weird texture to it so I stopped eating it halfway. It was getting a little soggy too from all the stuff they put on top of it. Tip: eat the pancakes first and right away (hard for someone like me who eats super slow)!

Our server was a very social guy named Eddy. He was awesome and definitely helped us out. I'm glad I was able to try this place out. It's pretty good but I would still choose another place to have breakfast but that's just me."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, interesting decor( literally had a front door lol it added charm) decent food. Had a good experience here and will probably come back. Personally I had the garden skillet with poached eggs with biscuits and gravy. Over all the meal came out well although I use a little more salt myself but that's just me. The staff was very friendly even with my overly energetic daughter making her normal sassy self send and heard. The menu had a very large selection which left me display appointed I couldn't try more, so I'll return to try some more."}
{"text":"For those who know me, they know I'm all about my breakfast foods. Bacon, eggs, waffles and all that jazz. So stacks and yolks seemed like it would be my kind of joint, and it was in some ways. The pancakes were huuge which was awesome, but wasn't as good or as sweet as some of the other breakfast places in town. The eggs were great when part of a scramble but not as good in the omelettes. I think maybe the omelette eggs didn't have the little bit of batter some places put that make it thicker. I'm a bit of a bacon snob, so it's hard to blow my socks off and they didn't. The bacon was passable because it's bacon and hard to make bacon bad, but man I would've lost it if they had a nice applewood or a thick hickory. Overall, it's not my top breakfast joint, but if you're in the area it'll definitely satiate your hunger"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast today and it was awesome.. Great service and atmosphere. The owner brought us a sandwich called the Tummy tuck OMG delicious eggs, bacon, and cheese between a doughnut...Hell yeah!!

My fav. breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"I have been to Stacks & Yolks several times now, but am not in love with the food or service. We started eating here because my husband is a fan of their Bacon from Heaven. Unfortunately, the last 4 times we have been here, it wasn't available and they did not even bother to tell us until 10 minutes after we placed our order. I mean seriously, if you are not going to serve it, take it off the menu or at least let the employees know so that they can tell customers right away!

The best dish I had from here was the Chicken Breast and Waffle. Unlike other breakfast restaurants, the waffle here is pretty thick, and the chicken was juicy and tasty. Here are the others that I have tried:

-Always November (single stack): This pancake had a good pumpkin flavor, but the cream cheese was too thick for my liking. The single stack was huge - I was only able to eat half of it.
-Smitty (single stack): This pancake was just way too dry, but the mint flavor was not overwhelming. 
-Biscuit and Gravy: The biscuits were not warm and the gravy was tasteless and horrible!

Service is a hit or miss. Usually, its not good at all - most of the servers do not care to check up on you or refill drinks. However, there are 2 servers that I remember who was very friendly and attentive. This restaurant is also very small and crowded. The tables by the kitchen counter are the worst because of the traffic and you feel uncomfortable eating when so many people are walking by and bumping into you. 

Not recommended. There are other breakfast restaurants that are so much better in this city, so do not waste your time!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  Fair prices and the Red Velvet pancakes and Mint Chocolate chip ones are the best!  Baha runs a great place with a small town feel to it.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very underrated. If you are looking for a fancy meal go somewhere else. This is perfect though if you have kids and also if you are on an \"Atkins\" or other low-carb diet plan. It is cheap, it is quick, the service is good, it is more like a \"diner\" and it really has great food for the money."}

I decided to try this place again was because they had an \"A\" Grade now.

My remarks:
Walked in and was greeted by owner, we chose a table and the place was not busy a total of 5 people. 

Owner came over after waiting several minutes and we placed our order, the order felt rushed as he was looking around constantly.

Order arrived fairly quick but it was cold and not as ordered. Fast does not mean good! The waiter (owner) did not check back to see if we needed anything. The guy who got us the drinks came back and I told him my eggs were undercooked, not as ordered. He took them right away and said o.k. I waited for 15 minutes no eggs returned. The guy then returned after 20 minutes and I said did you forget about the eggs and he said no and by then my boyfriend was almost completely done with his plate of food. He runs back gets the eggs and they arrive less cooked than last time, eggs were running all over the plate. I took the plate up to the owner who happens to be our waiter and told him to take them off the check. 

He apologized when we were leaving, but the food was not worth the price!"}
{"text":"I had very high hopes for this place, but it was okay at most. I ordered the marinated steak tips and it was okay. It was cooked well done so it was difficult to chew on. For something that is supposed to be marinated, it lacked flavor. The A1 sauce saved it. The potatoes were tasty, not the best texture because they were not crisp on the outside, plus they are much larger cuts of potatoes. The service was kind of odd. I did not have one server but maybe 6? One took our order. Someone else brought our food. Someone asked us if everything is okay. Three others came by too. I felt rushed the whole time. The check was dropped off a couple minutes after the food. Plus the servers kept asking if we were done with our plate, mid-bite! O.O Can't you tell that I am still eating? I would definitely come back to maybe try some stacks or yolks, cause that is what it should be famous for right?"}
{"text":"My fella was craving eggs benedict and I'm always up for trying a new place. 

We arrived around 11 and the place was pretty crowded, but we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. The table was cramped but we made do. 

I ordered the lumber jack with scrambled eggs, sausage links, home fries and upgraded my pancakes to the lemon blueberry so I could share them with the table. My fella ordered the eggs benedict.

Service was friendly and attentive. They were on the slower side because they were so busy, but when our food did eventually come out it was delicious. The home fries and the lemon blueberry pancakes were my favorites. The pancakes are probably some of my favorite that I've tried in vegas, perfectly cooked, the blueberries were flavorful and ripe and the hint of lemon complemented the flavors perfectly.

I am definitely a fan of Stacks & Yolks and look forward to coming back again soon."}
{"text":"Service is meh. One girl brought the bill to us and four other tables and still couldn't figure out whose bill it was. Yikes. They also kept moving us for a \"big party\" that was coming in. Despite that, the food is always great. I always get the birthday cake pancakes with extra whipped cream and a side of Nutella. So delicious and of course I can only eat about one pancake but who cares! They also have freshly squeezed oj that is yummy!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. We got sat an got our drinks right away. Then we got forgotten about. We waited a while before we flagged the hostess down to have someone take our order. But the food made up for it. I wonder if they are short staffed just for today?"}
{"text":"Came to this place with an open mind...bottom line the food is very good here...my kids can't get enough....service is top notch.....we had Katie last time....always made sure we had everything we needed, glass was always full of beverage.....prices are amazing...my kids eat for 4 bucks and fills them all day long..how can u beat that...even the bathroom facilities are good... This is now our number 1 place to eat. Even though I can't remember her name....she is the hottie dark haired waitress.  She serves customers right, plus she is beautiful....please ask for her or Katie...u won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away and always busy! I love the staff and they have a HUGE HUGE menu! The food is amazing and the place is very clean. Everyone is polite and food is amazing."}
