{"text":"I've been here 3 times since it opened and overall it's a great place. Great atmosphere and the owners always check to see if everything is okay. Unfortunately, the food has been hit and miss. They seem to often run out of their best sellers on the menu which after the 3rd time gets really irritating. I've also found their plates to be inconsistent. It feels like they're still figuring things out."}
{"text":"I will drive back to Etobicoke even if the only thing on the menu was the Hot Stove House Salad. If you you know me and my eating habits, your jaw just hit the floor! As tasty as my Reuben was, it was that delicious salad that had me raving to my family and friends.
I didn't catch the name of the server but she was excellent. Even with a table of twenty to deal with, she still made it to my table five times to make sure everything was going well. Of course it didn't hurt that she was very attractive.
I'm looking forward to my next visit and that awesome salad!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on the advice of a friend. Made the short trek to Etobicoke on a Saturday evening. 

Was greeted on entry by a server and the owner. Chose a table to our liking as the only other patrons were at the bar watching the TVs. Service was fast and the order was accurate although the server was not that familiar with the menu and didn't really respond with any recommendations on the items we asked about. Smallish menu but some interesting items. 

Cesar Salad was good, traditional but large enough to split. Short Rib small plate was very good.  Penne entree also very good and large portion size. Turkey meatloaf was less enticing. Dry protein, lacking sauce - mashed side tasteless and seemed to have been sitting for some time. Good sized portion of season veg nice touch. 

Overall a decent meal and good service. Bill $80 for two apps, two entrees and three drinks. Decent value. 

Advertising a new menu for late Sept so will probably give it another try. Probably will have to up their game if they are going to be successful over time. 

Beer specials, not aware of any nightly specials."}
{"text":"$5 pints of Keith's and moosehead during leaf games. Amazing menu of which I've only broken the seal with. Incredible service. Our wonderful waitress remembered every single persons name at a table of 20 and provided top notch service. I was ecstatic to see donairs on the menu so that's what I ordered. Unfortunately this is not the donair you're looking for. Little meat, no sweet sauce, more of a gyro than a Donair and I hate when I'm mislead but still tasty. Will definitely try the burger next time as it looked and smelled fantastic. Great atmosphere, a welcome addition to new Toronto. I will be back."}
{"text":"Made me feel like Harry Potter! First, only if I was wearing an invisibility cloak could I explain the hour it took for my food to show up. Second, I overcame the forces of darkness (they turned the lights down- were they hoping I wouldn't notice I had no food?). Third, everything was scorched as if Voldemort ran the kitchen...next time, give me Bertie Botts vomit flavoured jelly beans instead!"}
{"text":"Stopped by last night for dinner with the wife. I don't throw it around lightly, but that may have been one of the nicest burgers I have had in the last year. Beautiful bun, stuffed with delicious Oka cheese and grilled just right. The grilled onions were really flavourful.
The fries were fresh cut and double dipped; spot on! Nice beer list too, with a couple local options.
I felt the value was pretty fair, $18 for a really tasty burger & fries is fine by me. 
Considering it was their opening night, I give them a solid 5/5. Looking forward to our next visit. Well done folks!"}
{"text":"this place has been getting worse and worse. I haven't seen a waitress there for the past month - the owner seems to be doing all the serving and he messes up a lot - forgets stuff, charges you for the wrong stuff, etc.

He's also chatty to the point that we had to rudely cut him off and start placing the orders, for we were hungry and it took him 10 minutes to come back to our table. In a completely deserted restaurant.

The menu slimmed down a lot: each time I'm there, i don't know what to get - everything is just blah. They now have some features which spices things up a bit, but still.

Food is not fresh. My friend's burger had a completely frozen tomato in it. Other time we were there, the meat sandwiches were completely cold in the middle, even though he assured us they were just off the oven.

And he just listens to the feedback, makes some jokes, and that's it.

I think I'm not going to go back, even though I like the space and the atmosphere. I just don't wanna eat there. And I don't want lame jokes."}
{"text":"Great little spot! Excellent food and awesome service! Nice to support a local resto where food quality AND presentation are at the top of their list!!! Nicely done Troy, Sean and the entire team!"}
{"text":"Ember Hot Stove and Social House is a true step in the direction that all establishments serving food and drink on Lakeshore should be taking. It's refreshing to know that someone is finally taking leap of faith and putting a downtown-worthy resto-lounge into this area. 

Summary of the evening: 
I let the bartender make me a drink - a cucumber lime martini - a truly dangerous drink and left me wanting to order a few more of the same. The martini had freshly diced cucumber and fresh lime juice. A beautiful spring/summer drink and highly refreshing. 

We ordered shareables - lobster roll, tater tots and wings. 
- Lobster roll is the best I've had yet. The creamy. tangy, grainy mustard on the plate adds so much depth of flavour and the lobster tastes supremely fresh, nestled in a crunchy, buttery roll and accented with crisp, cool celery. Amazing. 
- Wings were a really good size with lots of meat, double battered and very crisp. We tried the Ember sauce. made with maple syrup and mustard, which in taste was fantastic, however needed to be a bit thicker to stay on the wing as it was so good but flowed onto the plate. 
- Tater tots were made with pulled pork fried in a crunchy coating and definitely had a home made flavour and consistency, nothing frozen here. Dipping sauce was creamy and tangy with a bit of cajun spice to it, complimenting the tots very well.

They also had some live entertainment - a gent with an acoustic guitar, setting a really warm ambiance. We've never been to a restaurant to eat with live entertainment but he had a great voice and was very talented with the guitar, leaving us really impressed with how the evening turned out. It really felt like a true date night.  He plays again next Thursday May 22, we'll be back for more!

Support these local guys that are trying to clean up the Long Branch strip and replace the dingy bars with a bit of class and a touch of heart and soul."}
{"text":"No service. No staff. No music. Terrible. Worst \"social\" ice ever walked into. Had to leave."}
{"text":"We came here on opening night and while not everything was perfect, they get a 5 stars for effort. The owner was wonderful, personally introduced himself and they took the comments very seriously. We look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"We chose Embers on news from a friend saying it was new and the online menu seemed promising..... Unfortunately neither the atmosphere nor the food lived up to expectations.

First off, walking in, nobody greeted us for at least a minute or two - and when you're standing practically in the middle of the dining room - it's an uncomfortable and off-putting situation. 

When we were finally seated, I ordered a beer on tap from the menu.....2 minutes later the server comes back and says they no longer have the beer I chose. Weird being the place is so new.

The food was sub par at best. Riblets were overcooked and hard and virtually tasteless; the sauce on them was two simple notes: a little sweet, a little spicy. The lobster mac n cheese was lukewarm and unimpressive. Ginger beef was okay tasting, but the beef itself was quite tough. The tourtiere was the highlight....which actually begged the question if it was indeed made in the same kitchen or maybe brought it and simply heated to serve.

I give Embers 3 stars on account of the server we had. He was quick, attentive, personable, and did a couple extra things to make our night a little more fun. 

If Embers is around still in 6 months, I might give them one more shot...."}
{"text":"From the looks of it it appears to be gone. Yesterday the Ember sign was gone. Replaced by  a piece of bristolboard with a sign stating Under New Management. Sadly another unique restaurant gone from New Toronto."}
{"text":"Loved it! Tried it first time tonight w my fiance. The place has been opened apparently only two months. it replaced longrain the thai restaurant. The owner introduced himself and seemed very nice. I really like the ambience. Different than the last restaurant. When we left they were setting up for a musician to sing with his guitar. Our waitress was great. Checked on us often even though we were in the corner. We didnt have reservation but they accomodated us. I had a salad and the lobster mac and cheese. My fiancee had the donair. I loved my dishes -  delicious! My fiancee thought his meal was good but not amazing. Definitely will come back!"}
