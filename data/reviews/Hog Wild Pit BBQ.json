{"text":"Low Quality Food with Instant Potatoes!! So I decided to check out my first BBQ joint since moving to Arizona. This place was a sad disappointment. I paid $10 plus to be fed crap on a Styrofoam plate. My Georgia pork was overly salty and no flavor. It was extremely dry and I had to dose it in sauce just to eat it. The sauce wasn't any better, tasting like sugary ketcup. Did I mention it was also barely warm. The potatoes were just add water fake crap. I mean how hard is it to cook a real fricken potato!! The gravy also tasted like it came from a jar. The coleslaw was probably the best item and it was just ok. Even the Texas toast just tasted overly of butter. On a better note the service was great. Our meal was ready by the time we filled our ice tea cups. But that's probably because everything was just sitting there for who knows how long. The place was also completely dead except for one other table. The atmosphere was nice with cool decor and it seemed really clean. However when you serve crap food on Styrofoam you will not get my return business."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant I order the \"Rib Dinner\" through the drive through. The ribs were over cooked had a burnt taste, and the ribs was very salty. The \"Rib Dinner\" comes with 1/2 slab of ribs and Texas Toast and choice of 2 sides. I had chosen the coleslaw and mashed potatoes and gravy. The coleslaw had no flavor, not sweet like coleslaw supposed to taste. However the mash potatoes and gravy was okay.  I ended up throwing the Whole $15 \"Rib Dinner\" away. This is my opinion and first experience with the restaurant food."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in Arcadia area. Good food, friendly staff and great environment.
You may need a bib if you get the ribs, tender meat just falls off the bone."}
{"text":"Yummy! This BBQ is sooo good! You have to try it!  It will be your favorite in central Phoenix too!"}
{"text":"Ribs under cooked and tough. Pulled pork did not hit 190 and was chopped not pulled. The sausage was tasty. The brisket was dry. The potatoes, mac and cheese, and beans were generic can type stuff. The coleslaw was decent. The service was excellent and the palce was clean. If only the food was better..."}
{"text":"This is my family's new favorite BBQ! We love the pulled chicken, brisket, AND pork! My children love their macaroni & cheese, too!"}
{"text":"As soon as we came in everybody greeted us , we felt very welcomed and the food was sooo delicious especially the ribs!!!  Definitely gonna come back!"}
{"text":"Not having a BBQ place in this area since Dickey's closed years ago I was happy to see Hog Wild open up.  I really wanted to like this place but, unfortunately, I've definitely been underwhelmed.  I've tried it twice and probably won't be back for a third try.
The brisket, the pulled pork and the chicken were edible but that's about it.  I had the ribs twice and they were a little better but not by much and the first time they were unacceptably fatty.  The mac & cheese tasted like something out of a box.
I'll stick with Little Miss for my BBQ."}
{"text":"This review is based on service only, since I didn't even get to try the food.  I walked in with my mom and son.  I was trying to find a way to feed everybody while allowing us to try different things on their menu.  Well first off, it says the \"Family Meals\" are for to-go orders only.  So I wanted to confirm this and I was told it's true.  Then another member of thier staff came over said that \"you can order the Family Meals for dine-in, I'm not sure why it says that on our menu\".  Ok, so why does your menu say \"carry out only\" then?  The #1 family meal comes with a pound of meat.  I said can I do 1/3 pound of ribs, 1/3 pould of brisket & 1/3 pound of turkey?  I was told yes.  Then I was told no because 1/3lb x 3 doesn't equal a pound?  What in god's name does it equal then?!?  Wow.  So then I was told if I wanted to order ribs they had to be at least a half pound and if I wanted anything beef there was an extra charge.  I was completely confused by the difference between what they were telling me and what their menu said.  I finally just told them that I was going to eat somewhere else.  This place needs to get it together.  To top things off, I saw them all talking about me on my way out.  That's a big no no.  Shame on you.  I was polite the entrie time.  It's not my fault you don't even know your own menu and you can't help a customer when he/she has questions.  I'll never go  back."}
{"text":"Never again! What a waste of money. Maybe it was because we placed an order for pick up around 7:30pm and they close at 8pm, but if that's the case then stop taking orders at 7:30pm! When I placed the order, the girl says \"when would you like to pick it up?\" I said, \"you tell me\"! She says, \"five minutes\", maybe that explains the cold food. We live five minutes away. We paid for peach cobbler only to open the bags and no peach cobbler. I called, they apologized and I said I would pick it up tomorrow. Next, the meal. The ribs were warm with no bbq sauce. Thankfully I requested some on the side. I ordered the baked potato and asked for the meat to be put on the side, it wasn't. I have a pet peeve when I am expecting chives on my potato and get green onions. There is a difference. Do not say chives when you are using green onions!  The baked potato was warm on top and cold near the bottom. The fries were soggy and cold. The Texas toast was soggy and cold. The root beer was flat and barely tasted like root beer which speaks to a lack of syrup. I called to express my dissatisfaction with the food. I spoke to the person who answered the phone the first time I called, and he apologized AGAIN. Then he said, \"I'll let you talk to the manager\". In the meantime, I was nuking my food, and I opted to eat my food instead of letting it get cold while waiting for the manager to come on the phone. Gee, thanks for taking the time to talk to me and make it right, and this is the MANAGER! There is nothing that pisses me off as much as paying good money for my dinner, looking forward to it and having all kinds of issues with it. They can keep their peach cobbler and lost two customers. I'll try Dickeys next time. But I will NEVER step foot in this place again! PS - I have zero ax to bear and provided details to support my one star rating."}
{"text":"I just left Hog Wild. I'm actually sitting in their parking lot. I came to taste test their ribs for my son's upcoming graduation party.  I have to say...as delicious as the ribs are, it's the staff I would like to compliment. They were welcoming, kind, and so sweet. They even gave me a sample of their hot link, and visited with me while I ate. I was very impressed with both the food, and the people who prepared it. You can tell it's made with love. Thank you to those working today!"}
{"text":"We've been watching and waiting for months to see if something was actually going into this restaurant-turned-shoe store. Now it's a restaurant again and it was worth the wait!  We've eaten dinner at Hog Wild two nights in a row, tried pulled pork, ribs and turkey. Friend had the brisket. Yum!!!  Pulled pork and ribs are our favs so far and friend loved her brisket.  Meats have great smoky flavor and sooo tender!  Great BBQ sauce, and meats wonderful with or without.  Love the cole slaw too. Looking forward to trying everything on the menu."}
{"text":"This place popped up out of nowhere. We have been dying for some good bbq, and we thought why not? We were greeted right away, and we ordered almost one of everything off the menu to get a feel. We got our food quickly and it was nice and hot. Everything we had was great, the ribs fell off the bone and the beans were sweet just how we like em! So I would say for a \"fast food\" bbq place it was great."}
{"text":"Right when you walk through the door you are greeted with a smile and the rich smell of smoking meats. The pork ribs are served sauce on and need no further dressing. The brisket was moist and flavorful but I couldn't resist experimenting with the 2 sauces they have in the table, hot (not so much)  and mild (kinda sweet); both were good. A nice meal with good service at a clean place. Hope them every success."}
{"text":"Good, basic barbecue stand with good prices and friendly service. One of the managers heard me ask for a Carolina style sandwich and was kind enough to warn me that it was not true Carolina vinegar-sauced pulled pork, but rather a pulled pork sandwich made with cole slaw. Duly noted, and while I hope that one day they will offer vinegar-based barbecue, I will keep coming back for all they do offer in the meanwhile. (Great slaw as well, by the way!) Don't be late; they close at 8!"}
{"text":"My grandma and I love this place!!! The food is always 10/10 as well as the service. They always recognize us and make friendly conversation which is greatly appreciated!!! The one thing I tell my grandma whenever we go is that they should have a tip jar bc I love going there and want to show my support for the staff too!!"}
{"text":"Hog Wild is really great. I wanted a lite meal, so I got the pulled pork dinner plate and it was very tasty, and waaay filling! The baked beans and cole slaw are delicious. The Texas toast is a great part of the meal too, helps in loading up the fork or spoon. I'd come back here in a heartbeat and try their other meats."}
{"text":"Really good BBQ sauces and meats had the chicken and pulled pork.  Sweet tea is a plus and the watermelon tea was good as well"}
{"text":"omg.... I just love their backed potatoes. If you want the best don't go to the rest go to hog wild!! Best BBQ in Phoenix and the prices are great. Every time my family and I go here it's always great customer service and the food is awesome"}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time trying this place and it was really good, especially the meats. You can't beat the prices as well. We will be back."}
{"text":"We wanted Rudy's but that was too far away. This is a great option closer to the city. I had the brisket and loaded baked potato. Great smoked flavor! Large portions with some for lunch tomorrow. Great service and staff checked on us often. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"+The sauce labeled \"hot\" is medium, yet has a deep slow tasteful heat.
+Good service and portions
+Smoked chicken was very tender
+Peach cobbler was very good"}
{"text":"I took my son to Hog Wild tonight - they just opened - and we were impressed with the pulled pork sandwiches. We both had it and so good. The curly fries were okay, not the best (I'm not a curly fry fan in general). The cherry cobbler was better than average. Atmosphere is pretty fast food feeling rather than old style BBQ joint, which is a bummer because there just aren't any great atmosphere BBQ places in Phoenix that I have found. But this review gives 5 stars solely on the pulled pork, which is the main event of the meal and we'll be back. The services was super fast and very friendly. Everyone working there must have said hello to us and asked how we are doing."}
{"text":"Found this gem along Thomas street. Wonderful BBQ at rock bottom prices. Sauce is amazing, staff pleasant and interior cleverly done. Would go back often if I lived here. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We had the pulled pork sandwich and beef brisket plate with amazing coleslaw and potato salad and toast. Next time we are going to try the cobbler that is home made."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for BBQ in Phoenix.  And I'm very picky about BBQ.

The restaurant was very clean and you could eat off the floor.  Portions were huge and meat was delicious.

We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for and this places ribs are not the best but they are still very delicious and priced just right. I'll be back again soon:^)"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this BBQ!  I tried pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw.  Coleslaw crisp and oh so creamy.  Pork was tender and the mild bbq sauce was sweet and tangy.  My mom had a huge loaded baked potato, loved it.  My daughter is a ham freak and the smoked ham was delicious.  Next time I'm trying the Mac n cheeee."}
{"text":"Pretty dang good!! I had the open faced ham sandwich!! Soooooo good! The ham a pretty big chucks of fat on it which I picked off but other than that dang good."}
{"text":"Fantastic Kansas City style bbq... I had the brisket sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was pretty good. I want to try the hot links next time."}
{"text":"Oh man, where do I even start?! I love this place so much I eat here twice a day. When I leave... I'm so full it's like a have a hug on the inside! Nothing but good food, good people and great friendly staff. Ribs & Taters  are banging!"}
{"text":"I'm from the South so I like my BBQ... and I was excited to try this fast food style place out. After ordering ($34 for two people) we sat down and started eating the meal. Immediately, we noticed everything but the meat and toast, was cold or undercooked. I thought \"well if I was going to a picnic under a tent this would be ok\", but this is a $34 restaurant meal. The Mac n cheese was cold not even lukewarm. The baked beans are actually lukewarm pork n beans - there's a difference. And the potato skins were more like 1/8th potato wedges that were hard and not cooked through... the shredded cheese on top was not even melted - at all. If you come here for the meat and toast alone I think you will have a decent meal. Just don't expect the sides to please the palette."}
{"text":"Smoke stack sandwich was great. Clean and friendly environment. looking forward to try the brisk"}
{"text":"Ok, it's been about six months, but this is back to five stars after the giant tater experiment. Any kind of diet will be ruined by this monster spud and it actually could have used even more sour cream. This version was topped with some nice, stringy brisket. Underneath the meat was alot of cheese, sour cream and butter and then bacon was drizzled around the take out carton with some chives for color and flare. I nearly ran out of sour cream, but maybe some extra next time as well. This was a very good lunch and 1/2 pound of turkey to go costs about $7 now."}
{"text":"This place is awesome great food!!! My favorite from now on! Pulled chicken with potatoe salad and mac an cheese to die for and the softest bread ever! Try the hot bbq sauce and you'll fall in love!"}
{"text":"My husband and i stopped in for lunch this past Saturday. He had the \"pulled\" chicken sandwich. There were 4 large pieces of bone in his sandwich. When he spoke with the young lady who had taken our order, she shrugged her shoulders and walked off! (Im doubting its pulled since bone does not generally get pulled off with the meat. Its probably cut off the bone.) The poor customer service is enough to not come back, but to boot my pork sandwich was dry. Their potato skins are wedges cover in cold sour cream, cold shredded cheese and cold bacon. I expect potato skins to be hot with melted cheese. On the plus side, their cobbler is pretty good."}
{"text":"Great bbq place. They have three different bbq sauces ranging from mild to Hot. Clean restaurant. I recommend."}
{"text":"First time but definitely NOT the last!! Large portions and the bbq is outstanding and I know bbq as I'm from Texas ! Customer service excellent!! Run don't walk and come here!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Great people. Will go again. I got pulled pork. I reminds me of growing up in the South. Portions are good and yhe sodes are tasty."}
{"text":"New place. Great place. AH-MAZing ribs!!! Do yourself a favor and bring an appetite. Great service. Great good. A little on the pricey side..but hey it's Arizona and it's hard to find great BBQ...this place is it. It close pretty early by AZ standards (8pm) so I'm pretty sure next time I get there the doors will be closed."}
{"text":"Ok. Hello customer service winners!! 
We needed to change our food order for our backyard wedding and we picked this place. SO nice and helpful and beyond met expectations.  Our guests loved the food and it was all around amazing"}
{"text":"This is the worst bbq style food this side of the Mississippi! The brisket was extremely dry and even the vinegar tasting sauce couldn't cover how over cooked the meat was. The macaroni was bland and tasted like paste. Never eat here!"}
{"text":"Decent portion. Mac and cheese is good but basic. Gooey, creamy and cheesy. Same for the potato salad. Nothing fancy but good. The two meat dinner can be shared if you're not glutinous. Beef brisket is moist but the extra side of sauce helps with flavor. The links are better with flavor. Will go
Back to check out the other meats but something tells me it may be the same"}
{"text":"Have been waiting for a good BBQ place,  this is it!  Big portions all you get what you pay for!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding bbq we ordered a huge order for Labor Day it was ready in record time fresh hot and so delish I will come here every time I need bbq seriously hands down great food"}
{"text":"Do you ever have an experience with a business that goes so flawlessly from start to finish that you can't wait to tell the world , 'THIS is the place !' ?!? This is my 5star review for Hog Wild Pit BBQ for knocking my experience with them and their catering this past weekend out of the park! I can't say how easy they made things for me and trust me , this month has been a bit of a roller coaster with purchasing a new home , work and life! A few weeks ago I decided to throw my husband a surprise birthday party at our new home. We have been in the home less than a month... what , am I absolutely crazy ?!! Yes. Yes, I am. I live in the fast lane and I guess I love chaos. I decided I would not be cooking .. not a thing. I started my search for good BBQ , (we both travel a lot and definitely have our palate for what we like in GREAT bbq !). My husband and I have been to several BBQ places in the valley. Some are good ; some not; some are over rated; some too vinegary ( North Carolina style !) for our tastes , ( even tho I married a NC boy!) Hog Wild was my last call on my list of 5 BBQ places that would cater. First off, the manager was over the top helpful. He answered my many questions and offered suggestions. I liked that, a lot. It matters to get that instant 'attention' when you want to make a plan and check that off the party to do list. Some of the other places I had to leave a voice mail, or send an email, OR the manager wasn't in. I can't. The other great thing was my package of two meats (smoked shredded chicken; Brisket ( chopped)) ; two sides ,( potato salad and Mac cheese); Buns; all the serving utensils and  the sauces .. was $8.99 p/p! There are an amazing amount of choices for sides and meats for this cost. But other packages for catering, as well! The best thing : delivery!!! Fast forward to the day of the party. Hog Wild showed up right on time, came in with all of this amazing food and started setting it up and asked me how she was to serve it. I was confused at first.. but then she explained that part of the delivery service is to serve the food, as well! Wow! I did not need this , so I thanked her and took all the foiled packages of meats and kept them warm. This group was gonna want some drinks prior to eats! When we got to the stage of the party where it was BBQ time , I simply transferred the foil packages to my own heated chafing dish and voila! The taste was amazing; the meats were moist , not dry and the sauces , hot and mild were very good. The sides were yummy! I had so many compliments and requests of where I got this food from. I almost wished I had business cards set up! We have a TON of leftovers and here I thot I wouldn't have enough. Well, I did! Some people had seconds and my refrigerator is full of meats and the sides! I can't say enough about how amazing and easy and GOOD this all was! Hog Wild I love how you took one of the most stressful parts out of planning a party and made it so easy. I'll be back and I'm sending my friends too!"}
{"text":"I have been here five times in the last couple of months and every time the food is fabulous. Give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First timer tonight and wanted to point out a few things here in this review... The outside of the restaurant is very clean, the kitchen area from what I could see from the drive-thru was well lit, staff were friendly and the kitchen looked very clean back there... I decided to do the two meat dinner, Turkey and Beef brisket, mac & cheese and mashed potatoes with gravy... $12.50 with tax... 

Portion sizes for the money spent, a little on the small side... The mashed potatoes were awesome!  Had a little kick to it! Mac & cheese was pretty good, their Texas toast I think was actually better than Canes!  However, the two meats I chose had really no flavor going for them, tasted dry, and the one small container of barbecue sauce was barely enough for one meat... 

I may give them another try in the future, but for now I can only rank them as high as three stars..."}
{"text":"The food is great! Even better than other places I've been. The meals come with a lot of food. To feed my boyfriend and I. The ribs are the best."}
{"text":"This Kansas boy has struggled to find BBQ in the Phoenix area that will meet my high standards. I am so happy to see Wichita's Hog Wild now in Phoenix. It is exactly what I crave. If you grew up with Kansas City/Central Midwest as your standard of measurement for quality BBQ then this is the place you have been looking for.
Go visit and go often! We have to keep this place open and successful in the Valley. I promise I will do my part!"}
{"text":"Ordered the brisket dinner with Mac & cheese and curly fries as the sides. The portions are huge for only about $11 for the plate. The brisket was disappointing however. It was shredded which is fine but I prefer slices of brisket. The meat was fairly dry and did not have a strong BBQ/smoky flavor. Didn't try the sauce because the bottles at the table were dirty. Both sides were good but nothing special. The restaurant itself was clean and spacious, but empty on a Saturday night at 5. Overall, this place compares to a Dickey's type fast food BBQ place which is fine, but I was hoping for more."}
{"text":"We have ordered here a few times and it's always been great.  We recently had Hog Wild cater a party of 30 people and it was great.  Everyone raved about the food and it was very convenient.  The catering prices are reasonable.  Everyone is super nice whenever we go there.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is just okay.

Pros: Clean, neat, service is efficient, good value re: portion size. It is an edible meal that's not too awful to eat. Good family restaurant (when I visited, a large family of about a dozen or so people had shoved some tables together and were obviously having a great time out together, so it is very family friendly!).

Cons: Mediocre food. Sides obviously from cans and boxes, and the \"star\" (the meat) is dry, bland, and not very evocative of a barbecue. And while the service is efficient, it's not overly friendly. Polite, but no real warmth behind it.

Although it's not too awful to eat this food, it's not great either. I got the open face sandwich which was brisket on mashed potatoes on Texas toast. The brisket was blah and needed the gravy to make chewing an easier prospect. The mashed potatoes were lukewarm, not fresh and hot. And the mashed potatoes were definitely not prepared in house - no discernible pieces of potato in them whatsoever. And the Texas toast.. wasn't toasted?? It was just bread. That was disappointing. 

I also got a side of curly fries and those were actually quite good - probably because they were the only thing on my plate freshly prepared. They were hot, crispy, and tasty. I wish anything else I'd eaten that day had been!

I had a few bites of my partner's cole slaw as well and I'll say that was also good. But it's hard to screw up cole slaw.

Overall, meh meal. If I want fries and cole slaw I can get those at a hundred other restaurants in the valley. I wanted tasty bbq, and Hog Wild failed to deliver."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  Note this place is clean.  The help is nice.  The environs are pleasant.  And they have a really cool giant pig portrait hanging on the back wall.  But that's where the niceties end.

Everything about the food pissed me off.  From small things like selling three kinds of iced tea but not offering sliced lemons to accompany (instead they have tiny industrial packets of lemon juice).  Their baked beans were a sugar-dominated gloppy mess.  No smoke flavor.  Their sauces are similarly sugary.  No depth.  No smoke.  Just sugary sweetness.

But of course much could be forgiven if the BBQ rocked.  It doesn't.  I came in with a group and we decided to order a 'family meal' for 4 which included our choice of meats.  So we opted for ribs (on the list of meats) only to he told, after some confusion at the counter which required a few workers to be consulted, that we could not order ribs for a 4 - person family meal.  Okay.  Whatever.  So we opted for brisket instead.

The brisket arrived as a shredded pile of plain, ordinary meat.  I was expecting slices of pit-bbqed beef - not dried shredded pile of beef.  No smokey flavor.  No dark bits of 'bark'.  Virtually indistinguishable from a roasted piece of a cheap cut overcooked and shredded and left for hours to sit around.

The 'hot' bbq sauce was not hot and with little tang - just overwhelming sweetness.  The condiment bar had pickle slices - the cheapest, most industrialized, neon-yellowed pickles you can imagine.  Felt like I was eating from products right off the shelf at Smart & Final.

I rarely get pissed off by a meal - but this one got to me.  BBQ can be great, and it's just not that hard to do something at least ordinary.  But these folks have managed to screw it all up, royally.  I won't be back - unless after permanently shutting it's doors they auction off the furniture.  In that case - I'm gonna come back and buy that pig portrait hanging on the back wall.  That thing is hysterical!"}
{"text":"First time here. I was driving by looking for a place to eat lunch. I love BBQ and was hoping they had baked potatoes. YES they did and it was delicious . I had added the brisket on top of my potato and it was cooked perfect. The prices were very reasonable. It was $12 for the potato and double meat brisket and a drink!!This place is now added to my lunch schedule at least once a week!!"}
{"text":"nice place! clean! really good ribs and pulled sandwiches. great fries! wish they had chicken - waiting for that too but the ribs were perfect!"}
{"text":"Wow! My honey took me here for Mother's day dinner. It was much better than we both anticipated. We've been to several bbq places throughout the valley and cant find much that is quality, but this place has changed our minds! We were very happy with our food. Meats were very moist and delicious!  Hot links and ribs were tasty too! Sides were great as well. Portions are large and very impressive. We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I had the brisket dinner meal. It was great. I also had some apple cobbler and it was very fresh. Very friendly."}
{"text":"Out trying a new spot for lunch with the family and happened upon Hog Wild.  Oh my!   Ranks up there with our favorite Texas BBQ!   Tried the pulled pork sandwich and they were outstanding!  We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Really really good BBQ! And they are SOOO nice! We had BBQ pork and BBQ beef sandwiches. Both delicious. Generous portions on a toasted bun for under $6. The owner brought us out a plate of Beef Tips on the house that were outstanding. He was so nice! The coleslaw was good, not too heavy on the mayo but could use more vinegar for my taste. Will be back soon! Would also be great for catering."}
{"text":"Good food and awesome service! I really like this place a lot so far.  for this place. Way better than Honey Bears BBQ."}
{"text":"Good barbecue.. Meat was a bit dry, but very flavorful.. Good sides.. I'd eat that again.."}
{"text":"Get yer ass over to Hog Wild asap. Great BBQ at nice prices. Got the loaded tater with brisket for the missus and I had two meat plate w corn and slaw. Add two sweet teas and we out out of there for about $20. City boy got learned, I am a fan for life!"}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant a couple weeks ago, and tried the open face. We fell in love with it, I just wish they had delivery or did door dash. Hands down a 5 star though"}
{"text":"We went back tonight and finally tried something different (as well as ordering the pulled pork family #1 like usual).  Tonight I also ordered the rib dinner - OMG!  I should have tried this sooner.  The best ribs we have had in a long time.  The meat came right off the bone, came with two sides and some toast for about $14.00.  Last time we tried Honey Bears it came to over $70.00 and just wasn't as good as it used to be back in the day.  Hog Wild tonight we spent under $50.00 for three of us to get full and have leftovers.  The coleslaw and potato salad are both awesome sides as well.  The only thing here that could improve is the desserts but hey, ice cream is a couple buildings over.  Fast, friendly service, cheap food that is great!  Can't ask for too much more than that."}
{"text":"First time trying Hog Wild and it was delicious. I had the two meat plate with ribs, hot links, potato salad, and baked beans. The hot links were smoky and subtly spicy. The ribs were fall off the bone tender with just the right amount of smoke. My potato salad was just okay. Some of the potatoes weren't as done as I'm used to. The baked beans, though? OMG! Best beans I've EVER had at a restaurant.  Good food for the money! I'll be back to try the entire menu!"}
{"text":"Wanted to check this place out as we enjoy bbq. Don't waste your time or money. Service was very friendly, so they get a couple of stars, but the food was just so-so. We ordered 1/2 slab of ribs and they were fatty and grisly without much flavor. The hot and extreme hot sauce helped. We also got 1 lb of beef brisket. It was dry and more \"shredded\" than sliced. We ordered a large curly fry (just ok) and a pint of bbq beans, which were actually pretty tasty. It was almost $40 and we didn't get drinks (we did take out). Served 3 people."}
{"text":"Great barbecue from Kansas. Ate at one in Salina a few times a just had to eat at the new one in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Passed by this place lunchtime and I turned in. Glad I did. Had the brisket and pork ribs - both excellent, as were the two sides - beans and mac & cheese. Worthy of a spot on the rotation."}
{"text":"Wow this Yelp review really works! I complained about the food in my last review. Thanks for the update and for the food. It was great this time and I will be back..."}
{"text":"Loved the open beef sandwich... amazing and would highly recommend. Great comfort food"}
{"text":"Moved to Phoenix from Texas, and was looking for a delicious overindulgent loaded BBQ baked potato.  It tastes just like home!!!"}
{"text":"worst bbq I have ever had. extremely dry meat in a fast food type of environment. they couldn't even get the watermelon tea right, which was sweet enough to make a bunch of 4 year old jump up and down all night.

the sides of mac and cheese and potato gravy tasted like the were out of a box. 

Ieft half my meal and left.

if t wasn't for the office workers nearby, it would be out of business very quickly. 

go to lil miss bbq near the airport for a real bbq experience."}
{"text":"I'm from the south side of Chicago and have also lived in Texas..... This place can compete with either.

Great food,  great price and you'll never leave hungry."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service.  I hope they bring back the bunt ends.  Oh and you have to ask for the spicy bbq sauce, the hot bbq sauce at r tables is actually pretty mild."}
{"text":"We just had the best barbecue we've had in a long time. I had the pulled pork and cole slaw. My husband had the beef brisket. All smoky and delicious. We asked to put the sauce on ourselves and it was great. We both had the $5.99 special including a side and drink. What an amazing meal! We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This place hit the spot! 3 meats combo for under $15?! And great service too! Ribs fell off the bone! Sauce was just right...no too sweet. Missed the 5 start cuz my brisket was good, not great. But I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Time is not on my side today, but i'm noticing that I had an unfinished review on here that DEFINITELY needed to be finished. Although my visit to Hogwild took place a few weeks ago, I remember the experience like it was yesterday (for all the wrong reasons) & I just have to say that this was the worst barbecue I have ever had in my entire life. I have driven by this place numerous times as I live nearby, but I had never tried it before mainly because I wasn't familiar with them & hate to take \"chances\" &/or make myself a Guinea Pig when i'm hungry... The parking lot is usually empty (which should ALWAYS be a red flag, especially during lunch hours) but after reading some of the \"good\" reviews on here (most of which are CLEARLY false & likely paid-for by the company), I finally gave this place a shot one day after mistakenly recommending it to my mother who came with: What a terrible dining experience!

I wanted to try a little bit of everything, so I ordered the pork ribs, chicken & beef brisket. I also had a side of mac & cheese, along with a peach cobbler, & later ordered what was supposed to be an \"Otis Spunkmeyer\" Chocolate Chip Cookie. As another reviewer noted, when I think of \"brisket\" I think of a large CHUNK of flavorful/moist smoked meat that you cut with a knife & enjoy: Hog Wild's idea of \"brisket\" is finely grated pieces of dried-up meat that tastes like anything BUT the \"brisket\" that anyone on this planet is used to. All of the meat was dry, & although the pork ribs were a little better, the ratio of meat to fat on them was TERRIBLE... Every time I tried to get a piece of meat off the bone, all I got was a mouthful of fat & it had very little flavor. The mac & cheese tasted like the generic boxed mac & cheese with the powdered cheese that you mix with water, heat & serve with your fingers crossed (instead of FRESH/mouth-watering mac & cheese that you would expect to find at a barbecue). The peach cobbler came in a plastic container (rather than served fresh in a cast-iron skillet or something like that) & it was cold & dry with no flavor whatsoever. Everything tasted like it had been sitting out all day long, & when I come to a \"Barbecue Pit\" I expect FRESH/flavorful Barbecue which is not what I experienced during this first visit. 

Needless to say, I won't be back (& just to save you some time, another one to avoid is \"Dickie's\" over on Indian School & 32nd St [equally as bad, as you'll see in my review]). Hope this helps somebody, & if you still decide to go here, you've been warned (be prepared for a HUGE disappointment). Absolutely disgusting & a complete embarrassment considering that I recommended this no-name place to family & friends before trying it a few times for myself (something that will NEVER happen again). I give them another year max before they shut down & hopefully a much better food establishment moves into the building (same goes for Dickie's). 

Ohhhh, and as far as the \"Otis Spunkmeyer\" Chocolate Chip Cookie, you're probably on the edge of your seat... So how did it taste?? YOU GUESSED IT!!! It was DRY/hard with no flavor, & as someone who has been eating Otis Spunkmeyer Cookies for YEARS, I know for fact that the \"Otis Spunkmeyer\" case they had it in was clearly just for show because that was DEFINITELY not an Otis Spunkmeyer cookie. This was probably the worst part of my entire experience, since the cookie was ordered as a means of cleansing my palate of the disgusting food that I had ingested moments beforehand."}
{"text":"call and talk to Andy to have a catered event for 12 guys he set everything up for me perfectly they delivered everything on time food was great service was great highly recommended will return thanks Andy and Dean"}
{"text":"Yum...   Not too many BBQ places around this area (Central/Arcadia)   came here to day, was greeted promptly and introduced to their extensive menu-- yum again!!  I ordered a pulled pork sandwich (it was huge, on a nice soft bun), sauce on the side -- hey,  the pulled pork was so good you don't need the sauce); a side of coleslaw (very tasty) and .... they have cobbler-- triple yummy good (choice of peach, apple or cherry).  I ordered take out, but the place is clean and decorated really cute.  Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try Hog Wild for the first time and boy am I glad we did!! It was so good!! First off the restaurant was very clean and the workers were very nice. We ordered the loaded potato with brisket and it was huge and wonderful! The brisket was very tender and flavorful! My husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and he really liked it also. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"It was great, delivery fast, food terrific, Finally a BBQ delivery that does not taste like cardboard with sauce. Will make this our BBQ place to go to. Next time will try the Brisket. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Love Hog Wild my plan was to try everything on menu but I got stuck on the open faced sandwich the pork is what I always get.  Love having a great new place in the neighborhood
Good food great prices employees are always welcoming."}
{"text":"Very bad experience but I'm going to be fair.  Ate there twice before and everything was great.  Went there tonight for a full slab of ribs, baked potato and coleslaw to go.  Got home to wife and a guest who we had already told that we liked the restaurant only to be sorely disappointed.  Starting with the ribs, not even warm.  Room temperature.  Then the Potato, it was extremely STALE.  Packet it all up and returned to the restaurant and presented the cold ribs and the stale potato to a man there and explained why I was returning it. I asked if he would eat that potato, no comment.   He promptly did a refund on my credit card. Great!  I guess what bothered me most is that he didn't ask if I wanted the food replaced and never even offered an apology.  Almost like this is just the way they do business and its routine!  If  you don't like the food just bring the shit back and we will refund  you.  No fucking big deal to them. Well its a big deal to me having to completely change dinner plans not to mention the hassle of having to drive all the way back for a refund, and all with not so much of an APOLOGY??  OK, I now understand how  you do business.  Save your time and money and go to Famous Dave's where you will never be disappointed.  Again in fairness, I ate at Hog Wild twice before with no issues.  Now that they have been tested on how they will treat customers after serving cold and stale food, I am very reluctant to EVER go back, especially when there are so many other choices.  Hap's, Honey Bears, Little Miss BBQ, Famous Dave's. On a side note, Hog Wild baked beans are so extremely overpoweringly sweet that you can t even taste the beans.  Worst baked beans I have ever had but the coleslaw is really good!  Good luck to your restaurant but you have pretty much lost what would have been a loyal customer due to your terrible customer service.  Thank You.  Famous Dave's here I come!"}
{"text":"We have been driving by for months and decided to stop in and give these guys a try.   Don't know why we didn't stop in sooner.   We tried their pulled pork dinners.     The pork was very flavorful.  The gravy on the mashed potatoes was fantastic and their baked beans are to die for.    The price was very reasonable, and the portions were large enough that we needed to go boxes.   Stop in and give these guys a try.   You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Great customer service & awesome food! Prices are good with the amount/quality of the food...  We had our first time eating lunch here today and it defintely wont be our last! We live in Tucson, but whenever we come back to PHX we'll definitely return back!! Keep up the great work here team!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite BBQ restaurant in the Valley!  I'm originally from KC, and this place continues their KC roots in Phoenix.  Thot hot and mild sauces are both great and the brisket sandwich is recommended 100%.  I also love that they have a drive through for convenience."}
{"text":"Now i usually just eat everything i payed for & give it a chance especially since it was my 1st time going. I tried it out & i have to admit that the Mac n' cheese was pretty decent, the mashed potatoes/gravy was creamy-tasted good if they were warm or @least HOT & or steamy you'd think coming from a BBQ joint, when i sliced through the juicy so'called 1/2 slab of ribs which was 2 totally pink inside & fatty w/burnt meat-skin outside & OMG the SWEET TEA was bland & had some sort of after taste-so to make sure i didn't flip out i saved them the humility & politely asked for my money back & it was NO PROBLEM there... Thank god! I did give them 1  for customer service before & after to be generous."}
{"text":"What can I NOT say about this fine establishment?
The Food: Good to the last bite. This place KNOWS how to do BBQ. And when I say \"BBQ\", I mean pork BBQ. Most BBQ joints get their beef right but not their pork. Hog Wild does pork BBQ RIGHT!
The People: Friendly Staff. No one rushes you to order. Very nice and courteous.
The Place: Very clean and neat. The only smells are the delicious foods being prepared.
Hog Wild knows how to put their foot in it."}
{"text":"Good BBQ and sides and very reasonable prices. Employees very friendly and genuinely want you to enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"AWESOME ribs juicy tender and you can still taste the pork. Perfectly seasoned I thought."}
{"text":"My department and I wanted to get lunch for ourselves and I researched over the course of 2 days to see what was all nearby.  Personally, I did not want Mexican as this was something that the team gets often and it is my least favorite cuisine.  To my relief, the team agreed to the suggestion of BBQ.

I called the location the day before to inquire and the lady that answered was incredibly nice and helpful.  The catering menu was way too much food for our medium sized group but they did have other options for smaller parties with the family packs.  Their #4 Family Pack suited us perfectly and we went with that.  This included 4 pounds of meat, 4 quarts of sides, 16 buns, and BBQ sauce meant for 16 people.  You can choose the different types of meat and sides that would like.  Our order was ready in a short time at pickup the next day.

The food was a major success and from the feedback received, the best lunch to date.  I couldn't agree more.  The team's particular favorite was the mashed potatoes.  I was the last one to try it and I can understand why it was a favorite.  It has an obvious garlicky flavor and might be overwhelming for some; I liked it a lot.  The different meats ordered received high praise as well.  For our team of 15 for that day, we had a lot of leftovers.  Kind of my fault because I ended up ordering extra food with extra funds contributed by some co-workers.  By the end of the day, we divided up the leftovers amongst ourselves to take home.

If your looking to feed a lot of people on a budget, you can't go wrong by choosing this place.  I'll post my receipt so you can get an idea.  I found the individual meals to be on the pricey side but you definitely get value when you purchase a Family Pack or go the catering route.

Thank you Hog Wild for helping us have one of the best lunches as a team!  If I'm ever in the mood for some BBQ while at work, I won't hesitate to return.  What a lovely way to start the summer!"}
{"text":"My Hog Wild Pit BBQ experience was just awesome..The Food was great!!!  This was first experience but not the last with this marvelous Food...I tried the ribs, chicken and hot links... mac n cheese and curly fries...I have told all my friends and co-workers... The Hog Wild Pit is the Best in the West....I'm planning on returning real soon like 
Monday.."}
{"text":"The BBQ here is the closest thing to BBQ that I'm used to back home (Texas) that I've had since I've been here in AZ. It's tender and moist and taste amazing, their sauce is much better than the average bland sauce that you usually find out here. I definitely recommend checking out Hog Wild the next time you're craving some good BBQ!"}
{"text":"Just ordered the Carolina sandwich, baked beans and potato salad to share with my 1 year old daughter. Praying the pulled pork would be tender enough for her. The meat was SOOO tender!  Sauce had great flavor. The coleslaw was delicious on the sandwich with just the perfect amount of flavor to cut the bbq sauce. The beans and potatoes didn't disappoint. Everything was delicious and will definitely order again soon. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"came in here last week. there employees are very friendly and the place is very clean. I got there plate with two meats the ham witch was awsome and the brisket it was pretty good to."}
{"text":"My first time and meal in Phoenix. BEST beef brisket I've had in a while. The service is great, food is delicious! For sides I had the mac n cheese and mashed potatoes with beef gravy and a drink all for $13 bucks. I would have paid double that with how great it was. Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"I went into this place one day that my boyfriend and I were just driving around trying to find something to eat for dinner, when this little place caught my boyfriend's attention...he loves BBQ.

We walked in, and the place it's really nice, clean, well organized, looks like any other BBQ place with the plaid table cloths. 

We ordered 2 meals that included 3 types of different meats, and 2 sides...the food was ready super fast!

And wow...we were surprised! The meats were tasty! Their BBQ sauce are simple: sweet or spicy, they are really good. Their meats are tasty, not dry, good portions. Their spicy sausage IS spicy! The sides are not impressing, I don't think they make their own potato salad, mashed potatoes, etc, so the sides were not great. They have a drive-thru which is very convenient. We are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This new barbecue spot offers really good ribs, good links and good cole slaw. The brisket was dry, very dry. Much of the food was served under temperature - cooked but cool. The canned corn was totally summer camp or school cafeteria quality, in other words worthless. The place is clean and the servers friendly. The music is country. One suggestion; in my opinion there was too much pepper in the food to appreciate it fully.  So, I'll be willing to return, especially sine the price is very reasonable, but the brisket and corn are out. I understand they have ham and turkey, so next time one of those and double slaw on our three meat platter."}
{"text":"Fast service.   Good stuff all around. 
We had pulled pork, brisket, ribs, and hot link. Cole slaw, beans, and mashed/gravy.  
Similar to Honey Bears overall. Mashed taters and gravy were very tasty. Joe's beans are better and given the option I'd get meats from Lil Miss, but these folks are closer with far more seating. 
We will likely return or order a family pack for home."}
{"text":"Nice to have another ribs place nearby. Ribs were a little over done this time but all around good quality food. Friendly service both times. Reasonable prices. But it's the welcome feelimg of the friendly service that brought me back."}
{"text":"Tried this place out tonight for the first time. Not at all impressed with the food or price. Got 2 different dinner plates consisting of ribs, brisket, pulled pork, with sides of Mac n cheese, potato salad, coleslaw, toast and mashed potatoes... for a total of $30!! The portions are very small (each side was about 1/4 of a cup.) Then they only gave me about a 1/4 rack of ribs and maybe a half pound of brisket and pulled pork combined. The toast was also not buttered but instead coated in oil and served soggy. There are much better places in Phoenix for good BBQ so skip this joint!"}
{"text":"So, I almost never write bad reviews.  I review places that I like and want to promote.  But I was disappointed in the quality of the food here and I went for one specific reason. Let me be clear up front that I didn't get the bbq, or any meat.  So my review is based on extremely limited data... I went because I wanted mashed potatoes.  I ordered mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and texas toast.  The mashed potatoes were not real potatoes, they were powdered potatoes :-(  So disappointing.  And the mac and cheese was ok at first bite, but was incredibly salty.  The toast was bread with oil on it.  

I will also clarify that I went through the drive through and the service was good and it was quick."}
{"text":"Gave this place a chance because of yelp.  I ordered a two meat dinner.  The meats pulled pork and beef brisket were tasty and juicy- def recommend. Had they mac n cheese and mashed potatoes and gravy both were okay. My bf got the Carolina sandwich and he loved it.  Portions were big.  The restaurant was very clean and had friendly workers I would come again. Oh...my bf said I should mention that it is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Andy and the crew at Hog Wild helped me look like a stud for Thanksgiving. I bought one of their smoked turkeys for a steal - $40 for a 12 pounder. Delicious flavor and very moist. I will absolutely get another one for next year as well as eat lunch here as often as my waistline will allow. I passed their work off as my own painstaking labor and took all the credit. Sorry if you're reading this Grandma."}
{"text":"We used them for a work luncheon for 80 people. We picked up the order at 1030 everything was ready to go fresh and hot. Everyone loved the food and desserts. . Will order again from hog wild."}
{"text":"The Pulled Pork was good and juicy and the portion was sizable but, the plate included a bun and one side of beans and cost over $16 with a glass of tea. That's crazy expensive for lunch."}
{"text":"Although I wanted to jump on here immediately to write a review, I decided to wait until I had multiple visits before making a glowing recommendation. Well, its been 3x now and I can't WAIT to get home and have my leftovers for dinner! 

This place is great - a Kansas City BBQ joint decides to open up 4 mins from me and I couldn't be happier! They have a full menu of BBQ favorites including ribs, pulled pork and chicken and they also have turkey and ham, plus chopped brisket which is really nice. So far I've tried the chicken, beef (chopped brisket), ham, and turkey - its all super juicy and delicious. There is a drive thru with really friendly staff that are happy to walk you through the menu if its your first time there - I recommend the BBQ platters so you can get 2 sides and a couple of meats to enjoy (or make 2 meals out of, as I like to do). 

I wouldn't say there are many downsides. I'd like to see a veggie option as a side - green beans would be great - but they have the standard ones like Mac n Cheese, coleslaw and beans. Also, they don't put much sauce on their meat - but they also don't offer up sauce on the side so you have to request it. The first time, I didn't know better and my turkey was a little bland without some sauce to help. I really like their Hot BBQ though, just the right amount of heat. 

Highly recommend, great location and nice folks that serve up delicious, fast BBQ - check it out."}
{"text":"I drive past this area every day on my way home. Yesterday on my way past, I caught a fresh whiff of the most glorious scent that I had never smelled here. BARBECUE.

It smelled so good that as I passed, I literally yelled and cursed in my car and turned around to find out where it was coming from. And of course, it was coming from Wild Hog. I knew I'd be coming back ASAP to get some of that goodness in my mouth.

Less than 24 hours later, I had convinced the wife to try it (she doesn't usually even like barbecue), and I was stopping in to grab some dinner on the way home.

She had the pulled pork sandwich, mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes and gravy. And the woman that will only eat barbecue about twice a year devoured every bite and was asking when we could have it again before she was even finished.

I had a 2 meat plate with ribs and hot links, and potato salad and mac and cheese. 

Everything was great and we both can't wait to have more very soon!"}
{"text":"From GA and figured I'd try the local Q as we have a lot in the south, not to mention Carolina gold.  Sorry if I picked a bad local spot as I'm not prepared to stand in wait lines and picked a delivery spot (uber eats) for this business trip.  Got the 3 meat (ribs, turkey, hot links) and two sides (fries and mac n cheese) with peach cobbler and requested Hot sauce to complete the delivery.  Ribs and Mac N Cheese were solid, amazing, would get again.   Hot sauce was med heat as another review mentioned.  Sauce on meat, which didn't need much, was sticky sweet, if that's your thing.  Turkey was amazingly moist, not very smokey and thin sliced.  Hot links was the spiciest thing and cut for a baby into thin slices.  Don't get the curly fries as my kids freezer crinkle fries are better.  Don't get the cobbler either.  Stick with the ribs and Mac N cheese.  Maybe request they leave your food as solid chunks and not run through the meat slicer..."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and order from someone one else. After being told 30-40 minutes for delivery we checked our \"Order status\" to find out it was adjusted to 75 minutes. So we waited in hotel lobby and no one showed. We called and everyone played the blame game. So no dinner, no one willing to fix anything and everyone claiming they did the right thing. 
Find a different restaurant and a different delivery service if you actually want to eat. 
Wish I could tell you how the food was....
The true test of a company is when something goes wrong and this restaurant and grub hub failed miserably.

{"text":"It is amazing to me how these people to think this is good barbecue. I am consistently let down by the barbecue joints here in the Phoenix metro area. The ribs were significantly overcooked and come slathered in sauce and most definitely happy to see around for hours. The brisket didn't even come sliced. It was pulled like you would serve pulled pork. And if you give this place anything other than a one you need to go to Little Miss BBQ.  Yes there is about an hour wait but I can promise you, you will never come back to this place again."}
{"text":"This place is actually very good. I tried the brisket sandwich, the potato skins and some cole slaw. The brisket sandwich was really good. Flavorful and tender and absolutely plenty. The slaw is creamy and just the way I like it. The skins were a bit over cooked and I would've preferred the sour cream on the side instead of a huge dollop in the middle which made 1 skin soggy but they were pretty good nonetheless. My only complaint is the drive thru cashier took my money with her gloves on and then went and made my food. Why even wear gloves? Other than that, I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"They say this is KC style BBQ. I did not care for it. The service was very good. The restaurant was very clean.  Dry good parking. The food was not good. I had the rib dinner. The ribs had to much sticky BBQ sauce on them and too much fat. I did care for the BBQ. I had macaroni and cheese and potato salad as side dishes. They were very bland writhing no flavor. If you have never had BBQ before you may enjoy this fo"}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my buddy while we were passing through on vacation. They were open a bit earlier than most BBQ joints around so we picked it to try. Being from the east coast we don't have much good BBQ. This place blew us away. The service was great, the food was ready by the time we were done paying, and of course most importantly the food was phenomenal. I'm sad that they don't have a restaurant near my home but I'll settle for coming back next time I'm in Phoenix. Awesome food!!"}
{"text":"Coming from a native Texan, this is top notch BBQ!!! Made me feel at home and loved the staff."}
{"text":"It was okay. service was alright. little bit pricey. salad had like three or four little strips of chicken on it for the up charge... whatever it was it's too much."}
{"text":"I want to say that this is one of the most authentic BBQ places in Phoenix. I read a 1 star review earlier by someone who obviously doesn't know what they are talking about.  I can't get past the brisket.  Perfection.  The restaurant is immaculate and clean.  The owners obviously take pride in their work and it shows. Great food.  Thank you so much for your craftsmanship. You guys know how to do it.

FYI - Look at the history of the 1 star reviewers reviews.  All negative.  Axe to bear?"}
{"text":"I've eaten BBQ from coast to coast and appreciate this type of cuisine regardless of region. I've had KC BBQ in KC, and let me tell you it was nowhere near as sad as the food I got here today. Skimpy portion of slaw that was maybe three bites. The meat portion wasn't much larger, but that was actually ok since it was so d-r-y and bland, the only flavor being the sauce, which was actually the best part. I left hungry. Someone should never leave BBQ joints hungry; that's a food sin. I don't understand why there are so many positive comments about this place unless they were paid for."}
