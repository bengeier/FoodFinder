{"text":"First time we went, we loved the food. This time, wings weren't that great. Normally, I'd still give them 3-4 stars, waitstaff was nice. But the clientele on the porch was the drunkest, most vulgar group of guys I've ever had the displeasure of hearing. The female waitstaff was scared off, and deservedly so. There is bar talk, and their is vulgar despicable disgusting talk about women. Even my husband was so disgusted that he left more than a dozen wings behind. We got up early, asked to pay our bill inside, and told the female waitstaff they should have a male coworker escort them out. Nothing happened. We even called and let the manager know about what her waitresses were subjected to, and she didn't seem to care much. As long as filth like that is allowed there, we will be spending our dollars elsewhere. Shame."}
{"text":"Discontinued \"All you can eat\" crab legs on Mon nights.
Didn't know until we arrived. We adapted.
Ordered 16 oz rib eye. Medium.
Got to the table extremely rare, and cool temp.
Daughters burger was nice. Her fries arrived 10 mins after the burger,
about the time I sent the steak back, with a request they keep it. The kitchen can't really handle cooking.

Waitress was really nice. apologized for the kitchen several times.
But she was not trained. We located and got our own silverware. She didn't have a clue to her own epic fail.
Never offered to refill a drink. Didn't know what many \"shot drinks\" were.

We'll never go back. It's bad bar food, trying to charge restaurant prices. Kitchen can't even make a steak.

If you want to go to a bar with good tunes, go. BUT, eat dinner at home!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. Do not order food here. It took 40 minutes for my dry stringy chicken to get to my table. It wouldn't have mattered if I got it fried because the fries tasted like they had been fried in week old oil. I know what that tastes like too since I've gotten food poisoning before from fries cooked in old oil. 

I ordered a side of roasted vegetables which were actually just raw with the sides of them burnt. This was a total waste of money and a total waste of time. There are plenty of delicious places to eat in downtown matthews, THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM!!"}
{"text":"Horrible, disgusting, barf, blahhhhhhhh.  I will never be here again. They're cooking oil is disgusting.  Bartender is disgusting and rude.  Nowhere near close to worth coming even though it is one dollar off beer night. Smells like throw up. Worsted  review I've ever made. wouldn't even give it a one star rating but yelp makes you choose something but I will give it my five dung  rating"}
{"text":"It took 30 minutes for our fried pickles and almost an hour for burger and wings. 
The only excuse the waitress offered is that we came in the middle of a kitchen shift change. 

Our drinks sat empty for 10+ minutes several times.  

Will not be back."}
{"text":"Wow! The service is INCREDIBLY slow! It doesn't look like anyone in here is eating yet and I've seen at least four people get up and ask what the hell is going on and several parties have left. Our appetizers (6 wings & onion rings) took about a half hour. When our entrees finally came, part of mine was left out, my mother's fish wasn't cooked, and they let us know after that hour that they were out of what my dad ordered. When the waitress returned with what she forgot from my meal, it was the wrong thing... Some tables have started making friends with the tables next to them out of pure boredom! So, if for nothing else, this place is good for making new friends!.. At least the waitress said she'd comp 50% of our tab... In the words of Fleetwood Mac... \"Never goin' back again\""}
{"text":"Like others I took advantage of a DealSaver, and I guess I could sum it up with one word, yikes!  Like others I was told that the bartender got a friend of hers to cook for her so that they could stay open, as she made a point to tell me it wasn't legal otherwise.  Based on the meal we had, they may have been well advised to stay closed.  We ordered the coconut shrimp and pretzels for  an appetizer, the pretzels would have been useful as a weapon, they were overcooked and hard as a rock.  They did comp these, so I guess I shouldn't complain (but if I do I save someone's dental work)  I ordered the low country bowl, I was a bit hard pressed to explain how one ear of corn seemed to be cold (almost frozen on one end) and cooked just right  on the other end, and how the sausage was so good and the shrimp was chewy and overcooked.  The other ear of corn by the way was hot, I am somewhat baffled how that might have happened.  Strange.  My wife ordered the fish tacos, and as they did come from the sea they thought it okay to reinvent that marine environment in the bottom of the basket.  The best part however were the bar patrons wandering around regaling you with horror stories of the bathrooms and talking about when it was Vinny's, and singing horribly off key to Jimmy Buffet tunes (we all know that one, right, about how we should get drunk and...).  The only thing that was missing for me was Bill Murray singing in a lime green leisure suit.  You can't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here allot. Finz is one of those places that you will either love or hate. We are those that LOVE Finz. We have learned what to order and not to order so it makes it easy for us when we go. The cook made a chili that they don't always make nor have on the menu but it was very, very good and wish it was an item that would be permanent. The Cheese Burger is also a really good choice. The fries are one of the best things there as well as their fried pickles with the ranch dressing. Our fav is their chicken tenders which we ask that they toss them in the cajun seasoning and we dip them in their ranch dressing. Man are they tasty. The beer selection is o.k. but we wish they had more room for more taps so maybe they could get a broader selection of the local craft brews. But all in all, Finz is a happening place with live bands some nights and a decent amount of TV's hanging everywhere for the game."}
{"text":"The food here can be iffy at times, but generally can't go wrong with the crab legs. Standard bar fare is also consistent. Had oysters on the half shell once and they were old, but thats my only negative experience. The wait staff is always cordial and attentive."}
{"text":"Yikes...almost gave this place 4 stars while I was thinking about the food and then I remembered the service. 

The food is very good for your standard bar food fare. I shared some giant nachos with friends and then had a chicken sandwich with mac and cheese. The mac and cheese is what you want to try if you do make it here. You can tell it is custom made and loaded with butter, cheese and deliciousness. 

Now, on to the service.....I'm not sure if it was just the night we were there or the server but man we couldn't have been left waiting in the wings much more than we were. The server was slow to take our orders, didn't check up on us and then took forever to get our food to us(could have been back of the house). For those of us having water we were down to dividing up our unused water rations at the end. 

Other than our service, which may have been to a off night, the place is pretty nice."}
{"text":"This place is a total $#!+hole....disgusting!  The most dirty establishment I have ever been to.  There were numerous un-bussed tables with leftover food from hours or quite possibly, days ago.  It took 40 minutes to get our order.  I was so pissed I asked for to go boxes as soon as the food came out.  When we did get it home.....it was crap. In addition the hygene of the wait staff and patrons was nauseating. The health department should have this place condemned. Never...never....ever setting foot in this dump again."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!! The bartender acted like she was doing me a favor getting my food from the back. Will never go back!!!"}
{"text":"The food & service were so good! I can't get over how fresh everything was. I ordered the surf & turf special with shrimp scampi. The scampi rivaled that of Red Lobster. My husband ordered the seafood steam pot. So much fresh seafood & corn with potatoes. Everything remained hot until he finished. Even the house salad was fresh & time was taken to actually arrange every piece. We ordered the spinach & artichoke dip for an appetizer. Omg! I can't rave enough!"}
{"text":"This place has gone so far downhill since the new owner decided to fire everyone. They were out of everything on the menu. The service was horrible.  It took forever to get our food and it was terrible.  They were out of pizza, wings, French fries, and hotdogs!  It's a bar for goodness sake!  Two people working the entire restaurant on a Thursday night simply doesn't cut it either. The DJ played songs with graphic lyrics at 8:00 at night while we had our 5 year old with us.  It was ridiculous.  We will never go back.  It's only a matter of time before it's out of business."}
{"text":"Great place. Good food, and friendly staff. Definitely try the fried pickles. I came here two nights in a row and had the fried oyster and steak with shrimp. Both dishes were delicious and came out promptly."}
{"text":"Finz is a pretty decent place to go and get dinner and some drinks. I have never been here late at night for the bar scene, so this is just based on my dinner experience. We sat on the patio which was nice and had a small tiki bar. You can smoke on the patio. The crab and shrimp dip was meh. I would not order that again. I came here originally because it was called a raw bar and I wanted oysters. I ended up with the fried oysters. They were absolutely delicious! My boyfriend got the two chili dogs and they were great as well. I will definitely be back to Finz soon!"}
{"text":"The most disgusting, nasty, horrible dining experience we NEVER had. There was wet toilet paper on the floor, tables all around us that had not been bused for hours. We were there as friends of the bands & felt bad for leaving them to go to another restaurant to eat. When we came back an hour & half later they were just getting their food. We finally flagged down the only waitress working & ordered a Coca Cola & a Tequila Sunrise. The bartender greatly over
 poured my drink....it was so stiff it could stand up in a corner. I asked for the manager prior to our leaving to go to another restaurant & was told he would be there in an hour. After 3 hours of nothing but excuses, & he would not accept a phone call from a displeased customer, I was asked to leave my phone number. Do I expect a call from.....um no. The only people that seemed not to mind the horrible service were the restaurants regular typical bar fly drunks!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location a few times and the food was good (oysters & shrimp poppers yum, yum!), the service was fine and the beer was cold - what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I have been to This bar several times over last few years. Of late it has gone down hill. The bartender seems inexperienced. The staff is not friendly. Food is ok. 

On a recent trip the bartender messed up a margarita. Finz get some better help."}
{"text":"finz is a great place. good food, great drinks. very nice people. certainly; never  forget the absolutely beautiful ladies that work there. finz, where a smile can make your day, and your always welcome."}
{"text":"My wife thought of a great idea to grab some carb legs for my birthday so she found Finz. Upon arriving we knew it was an old Vinnie's which at times could be sketch. Upon entering you could tell this was not a normal restaurant because of the seating set up, not really a separation between the bar and the dinner tables.
We were greeted as we entered and led to a table of our choice. Waitress was great and was pretty attentive. The food was good, definitely worth the prices which are decent. I ordered the Crab Legs my wife got the Steam Pot, My Step Father got the Peel & Eat Shrimp and my mother got the Shrimp and Scallop Pasta. All dishes were great except the Shrimp and Scallops were a little over cooked but the Pasta sauce was great. 
Now the bad, shortly after arriving and enjoying our Spicy Honey Shrimp App (Not SO Honey) there was an altercation between the Lady working the bar and a So Called Patron that apparently spends 8K a year there, ha ha.  The young lady decided to curse loudly at the man and hit him with her purse as he tried to defend himself and get very loud. There were kids there and this was around 7:30 which is normal for a Friday night dinner. After the families cleared out and the night went on the patrons who were regulars began to conversate about the incident with major profanity laced statements. As a first timer I could not believe their was a manager there to handle the incident and take care of the language as folks were enjoying dinner. Better management is needed. 

I agree with other folks the food is good but the regulars are not so welcoming. Unfortunately you cannot pick your customers but customers can pick their place to eat. I suggest if you are a family stick to weekdays maybe but FINZ is not a Grill more of an bar with good food. 

I will say that our waitress did apologize for the actions of the bar tender  but other than that nothing was done to cater to the guest who were trying to enjoy dinner."}
{"text":"A great place to watch the game while having an affordable drink and enjoying great food. The food in particular is much better than you would expect from a normal neighborhood bar. Be careful though, the owners, staff & customers are really friendly; you could find yourself hanging out here a lot."}
{"text":"The place was dirty (windows, some flooring and the bathrooms NOT cleaned since the previous nite. I know it was from the previous nite as there were no other lunch patrons while we were there. Now we know why.)

No real complaints on the food. I assume this place is not related to the Fins in New Orleans (lived there also) as there seem to be less \"inconsistent\" issues with the New Orleans food."}
{"text":"I  don't think this is the kind of place that someone would check Yelp before going to, because it really is as bad as all the one-star reviews say it is...and if you need further convincing then you deserve to have a bad experience, as you will. This is a terrible bar and restaurant. Anything more than a two-star review is an obvious shill or person with a severe mental problem. I went here to join in a blues jam since the Charlotte Blues Jam has tried some new places. This is the worst of the bunch and needs to get flushed like the garbage it is. Very nasty. I could post details but just don't go here. Disgusting. Message me if you want details. Nobody will though. This is a forgettable, about to go out of business hole in Matthews that nobody goes to, or should."}
{"text":"I read all the reviews after my girlfriends decided to drag me out to see a Band last night. The place was not packed so parking wasn't an issue (we got there around  8:30pm but it was Good Friday after all). 

No meat so we he had the veggie platter with hummus, coconut shrimp with spicy orange dipping sauce, fried calamari with an asian chili type sauce, crab meat stuffed mushrooms. 

I have to say the food was excellent! Portions split amongst us were perfect, this is not your typical bar food. In fact, if you've ever been to Bonfire in Monroe while its a lot bigger - the food here at Finz is head and shoulders above them, and I know my food at every level :)  Bonfire I'd pass on sorry. 

Bathrooms are very clean, the bar itself and tables are as well, and the Waitress we had was a sweetheart! Loved her, very attentive. The prices were perfect! Nothing broke the bank, which is why we were able to get a bunch of appetizers and sample a nice variety of picky foods! Great menu!

Saw kids leaving around 9pm with parents so there are high tables to eat at. I know you can book parties there, they apparently have two tonight per the waitress. I'd absolutely consider it for a party esp. with bands like Smiling Dogs or SugarSmax. 

All in All, if you want a nice night out with friends, able to see and hear a band from anywhere in the bar (by the way they were not so loud that you left with a headache like Skinnyz). Apparently they have an outdoors area that we will definitely be back this summer to try out. LOVED the band, hope to see another tonight, you can't beat free as in no cover charge (please don't change that!) and close to home. 

I think we'll try the burgers tonight to see how other items on the menu are but kudos to the chef there. The salads that walked by looked awesome too. 

*Note: we wanted the Caprese Skewers but they were out of Mootz :( and I saw someone walk by with a pizza that looked just a littttttle too dark, but still give them four stars, we are fans and will be back. 

You have a winning mix there, don't change anything!"}
{"text":"I had the crab legs. They were great! The service was also excellent."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for Finz about a week ago. I have been 4 times in the past week. Each time I have had to leave because they are not serving food. Still serving alcohol...  Believe that is illegal to sell alcohol and not food if you consider yourself a restaurant. 

I went to this place when it was Vinnies. Then when it first became finz. This place has steadily gone downhill for years. I can't possibly fathom this place lasting the rest of this year. 

If you want Michelob Ultra and....  Nothing else, Finz is your place, but I don't think they serve food anymore."}
{"text":"I recently decided to try this restaurant because I drive by it everyday to work. I love seafood and the name made me think, \"fresh and yummy.\" The place was very friendly and kinda the local bar hang out restaurant, which was fine.  I really was not in the mood for oldies rock, or any loud rock music while I am eating lunch in the middle of the day during the workweek.  It just made it difficult to talk with the person I was eating with, which was a deterrent to go there as a lunch location.

 I liked the offerings and the prices were reasonable, however I was disappointed that a restaurant with the name of \"Raw\" did not seem to offer much raw or \"Grill.\" 
The atmosphere was great for \"partying.\" However, for the age group it attracts (over 30) do they want to \"party\" every time they go to a bar or restaurant? 

Will I give it another go? Maybe...try it one more time. I was disappointed because it has so much potential and I want to love the place. At least turn down the music during lunch. Just an idea. The fish tacos were not that great."}
{"text":"I really wish that we could give zero stars. Finz is an absolute DUMP. DO NOT GO HERE!

A friend and I walked in and waited to be seated since they had a \"please wait to be seated\" sign. We waited. And waited. And waited. And then left after being ignored for ten minutes. This is probably a good thing because the inside looked like a complete disaster. Imagine a dirty room with random chairs, fugly servers, cigarette smoke so thick that you can barely see, and cheesy cover bands. That is Finz to a tee.

AVOID."}
{"text":"I got up from my seat and stumbled to the door in complete disbelief. I put my face in my hands as I opened the finger stained double-doors and found myself standing on a broken wooden ramp covered in cones to deter even the blindest of people from accidentally taking a misstep.

I went to the gas station and immediately bought a pack of cigarettes, a habit I had quit over a year ago. Finz Raw Bar did this to me, and it might do this to you. I showed up to see the live music and left with an anxiety attack. Much of my anxiety is food related. To the point: I was served a completely raw chicken sandwich. It looked like a piece of raw chicken zipped into a cloth orange breading. I spit out my food on the plate and showed my waitress immediately. She looked like she was going to faint. She assured me that nothing like this had ever happened before in their establishment. Truthfully it looked like it might have been frozen, I even mocked it's appearance, two crummy looking chicken fingers covered in cheese on flimsy toast. The chicken mocked me back. Instant karma. Though to be fair; it didn't uncook itself. As I bit into the cold and slimy chicken I was taken aback as I could still see the fat renders in the breast.

I would like to charge the chef with attempted murder. Finz Raw Bar certainly lived up to its name (ayy lmao). They will be paying for any hospital bills I have in the next 48 hours. The manager doesn't know this yet because he wasn't around. I hope the chef gets salmonella poisoning. I hope he gets into a small fender bender on the way home that his insurance won't cover. I hope he bites his tongue and slams his finger in a door. I hope he trips and falls into a frozen pond. I hope he gets hemorrhoids."}
{"text":"Went for lunch - ordered fresh oysters and clams. They were frozen. Ordered their special phiily egg roll - greasy and disgusting. Very bad food."}
{"text":"I've been to Finz twice now - both on weekend nights. Friday nights are packed, so be warned! We sat at the bar both times and came specifically for peel & eat shrimp. The price is reasonable for Charlotte and both times they've come out of the kitchen still steaming hot and drenched in Old Bay - my favorite! 

This isn't a fancy place by any means, but if you're in the area looking for a cold brew and some bar fare give them a shot! 

Next time I may have to check out their wings, they look delicious!"}
{"text":"Cute place with nice outdoor patio, little chilly for use though.  Inside is clean.  Your local kinda place were you can have a good time.  Service was great, our waitress did a great job.  Had the wings and oysters which were huge .  To bad they tried to steal my friends iPhone she left m the table."}
{"text":"We tried Finz on impulse.  It was pretty good!  We had the Cajun Shrimp Steam Pot which was huge, I am glad we shared it between two people because it was a lot of food, the shrimp are huuuuuge.  We also had a tuna appetizer that I am not sure if it was on special or on the menu, but it was really good.  The mac and cheese was a little chewy, not great.  We got to pick our seats, we tried outside but the amount of smokers out there was terrible.  They should make the restaurant non-smoking in this day and age.  It is a dive-like bar atmosphere though so perhaps that's why they allow smoking like that.  Our waitress was very kind and service was prompt.  Come casual, it looks fancier on the outside than it is on the inside.  The prices are a bit high for the experience."}
{"text":"Although the service was excellent, my family and I were very disappointed by the availability of items on the menu. We called ahead to make sure that they had oysters, but were told that they were out about five minutes after we had placed our order. Shortly after, we were informed that they were also out of the seafood pasta dish which two of the people in our party had ordered. I can't understand why a restaurant with \"raw bar\" in it's name would be so nonchalant about running out of oysters. Very disappointing. The food wasn't impressive enough to make us give it another try."}
{"text":"You can't leave zero stars. This place has the worst service ever. I've been coming for trivia for a few months and it's gotten progressively worse. I've been sitting here for an hour and no one has even acknowledged my table of four. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"THEY ARE NOT SERVING FOOD. however, theyre still serving plenty of alcohol which is ILLEGAL. Doesn't even deserve one star. We have a Groupon and are asking for our money back. We have tried three times this week to eat here. THERE IS NO FOOD WTF! ONE SERVER WTF. NO KITCHEN EMPLOYEES ON SITE? I don't know whats going on but screw finz. Don't go."}
{"text":"Sundays all drafts are $2.50 and wings are 45 cent. Great deal!! Nice open patio also."}
{"text":"Have to agree with other recent reviews. 

Went here either December or October 2014. Pretty good joint.

Return visit in May 2015 ... WOW. The 45-minute wait for food is no joke. They were actually out of bacon for the bacon cheeseburger, but didn't cut me a break on price. The fries came 5 minutes after the burger arrived. The soft drinks were flat - you know, like an open two-liter three days later.

I'm puzzled how this joint hits the skids so hard. It wasn't just me. The 4-person party next to us waiting 5 more minutes than us - and they ordered earlier. 

Look at the recent reviews before going. The reviews from a year ago were probably right ... for that time. This place is fading fast. Shame."}
{"text":"I went by Finz last week & it was all dark.  I found that odd.  I was then in another restaurant a few days later & the owner & another restaurant owner we speaking about the place being closed.  So, call ahead, I think they are out of business.

https://www.facebook.com/finzrawbar  - some are saying they aren't answering the phone, etc."}
{"text":"Worst service I think I've ever had. My wife and I went in to grab a quick bite to eat. We were only allowed to sit at the bar (hint hint) and there were  crumbs everywhere in our area. We literally offered to wipe the area with a rag that the bartender had. She ended up getting embarrassed by the mess and wiped it off for us. But she half did it so there was now just wet crumbs everywhere lol. She must've been shocked  when we said that we wanted water to drink bc she didn't offer us anything else for the next 10 mins. She just talked to the regulars until we walked out."}
{"text":"Worst service that I have experienced in a long time.  We sat and waited for our drinks for 15 minutes.  Food was decent but no cocktail sause at a place that serves seafood!  Come on!  Also, when we got our check they charged us for two beers and we only ordered one.... I can understand if the place was busy that service would be slow but that was not the case.  We will not be back!"}
{"text":"Been here when it was Vinnie's, but finally got around to coming back to try it under its new name:  Finz.  

Parking is sort of a nightmare depending on what night you go on.  This particular night, it wasn't so much busy, it's just that the people the parked before did not make an effort to stay in their spaces.  In a tight parking lot, this is detrimental.  We did manage to find a space.

Upon walking in, we were warmly greeted and seated right away.  They were having trivia on a Tuesday night.  It was almost halfway in so we figured it had started pretty early (7 or 7:30).

I honestly couldn't remember what the Vinnie's dining room setup looked like, but the current Finz set up was cozy and casual.  The menu was pretty extensive - took a while to read through, but had lots of options.  You can get anything from a decently priced sandwich to a sizable seafood dinner (with items at market prices).

There was a yelp check-in special where we got 6 free wings.  Our waitress was super nice and gave them to us... a little while later, the manager wanted to see my phone, but no problems.

It was Shrimp night on Tuesdays so I got a basket.  They were breaded nicely and not too greasy.... they came with a tartar dipping sauce and I chose a baked potato as my side.  I was pretty satisfied with my meal and would come back to order it again.  The wings we got were good - decided to try the parmesan garlic wings.  Light on the sauce (in a good way) they proved to be tasty - I'm sure the other flavors probably would have had more kick to them, but they were cooked nicely.

Overall, Finz gets a solid 4 from me.  Matthews is lucky to have a place like this that is centrally located and easy to get to."}
