{"text":"My favorite thing about this restaurant was the atmosphere. In the lounge area they had a live band come in and play. We had the calamari and flat bread for appetizers. The sauce they put on the calamari was amazing! So many great favors! However, they were quite rubbery. With the flatbread it came with three dips, the cheese one was the best, the antipasto came frozen we had to send it back. The entree was better. We tried the burgers, the quinoa burger was good, we also ordered the normal burger but you can probably make a better burger at home, it was cold and dry by the time it got to us. There were a lot of great beers on tap, things you wouldn't normally see. Great beer selection. I would be tempted to try this restaurant again but there are so many other places to go."}
{"text":"Want to be good but aren't quite.  First of all the food served at the Sunday brunch is good, but... there are some unnecessary flaws which makes me subtract some stars. One major issue is the internal organization:  They serve coffee which you might drink with sugar and/or cream but there are no spoons. We asked for spoons specifically for stirring the coffee and got soup spoons. Then there was a soup on the buffet but no spoons anywhere. Same with one of the deserts: it came in a tiny cup but no tools around (spoons?) to be able to eat it. Do you see the issue?  Another item missing on the buffet was butter for the buns. Sure, they served  some butter to our table upon request but come on, this should be an item available without asking for it.  During your brunch they come around with specialties. The pace was a bit fast and when we asked for a break our server told us we might not be able to get this specific special again.  Finally the booking window is tight for brunch and if you really want to enjoy the variety of food it feels rushed. Our server took away dishes and cutlery while we were still eating and without really asking if we were finished. The cheque came before we even had desert.  In total you pay a bit more than $30 per person for the brunch which is way too much for the service they offer.  To get it straight: the second star is for the food they serve!"}
