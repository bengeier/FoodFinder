{"text":"I love this place. The staff is so nice and it's always the same people and I really like that. The food is amazing I love it. It's my favorite restaurant in glendale. This place is great and it's diffentley worth a try. Friendly staff and great food."}
{"text":"loved it for the fast service, good food, atmosphere and decor...great family resturant.  The only thing I would change is that I could have a side of corn tortillas instead of the flour ones they gave me."}
{"text":"Good good, great service, well priced. Excellent place for a date night or family outing."}
{"text":"Took the family here based off of previous reviews we had read. Let me be the first to say the reviews were right on, the location was very clean the staff was extremely friendly and the food was amazing. I have driven by this place so many times and never realized it was there. And extremely glad we went to check it out. If you have the time and looking for a great relaxing meal give them a try. We will definitely be going back. The salsa is also delicious bought some to take home with us."}
{"text":"There ok nothing special but was good and beer and liquor was crazy expensive the bartender was nice and so was the waitress but if u come here to eat and have drinks prepare to pay alot"}
{"text":"This was an amazing find for me and my lovely bride. We are picky about our Mexican Restaurants and was extremely surprised with this place. The first thing you notice is the cleanliness, then the decor is very authentic to what you would see south of the border.
The staff was very friendly and prompt! The salsa and chips..A+
The food was very good and not greasy or bland, great flavor....a must try!"}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall but dont let that fool you. Delicious food with generous servings, good drinks and friendly service! Will definitely be a go to when we're feeling Mexican!"}
{"text":"Excellent place. Good service. Great food....great quality of authentic Mexican food. I highly recommend it. Will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Our first visit, decided to go here based on good Yelp reviews. We will definitely be back. We like spicy so we ordered their hotter hot sauce. Prices were higher than other places but the quality was good."}
{"text":"We were promptly met at the door, chips came promptly, food was excellent, though more lunch-sized portions were served at dinner prices.  Would come again, but more likely for lunch."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here many times and loved it for over a year now. However the last visit we made, the service was terrible, the portions were smaller for increased prices and they charged us for chips and salsa. She said the 2nd serving of chips is always additional money. Mind you, there were 5 of us that went...our family size never changed. We spend an average of $60-$75 on each visit. Due to these changes, our family will no longer be visiting Anaya's."}
{"text":"Food is great, authentic, but a small selection. Restaurant is small and homey, service sucked the day I went. That is why the three stars. I had to give at least 2 because the food is good but the service sucked and this is my first time coming here. There was one waiter and he took forrreverrr, to get our order in. We were just about to leave getting tired of waiting when he finally came around and took our order. Didn't say sorry or nothing, just, are you ready. I would go somewhere else to find some good authentic food but to each there own. This was just my experience but will never go back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went in for lunch today. Had a basic chicken taco, rice and beans, but the flavor was not just basic. Chicken was tasty and seasoned to make the taco delicious. My daughter had the posole, which was also very good, came with all the fixings. She also had a refreshing  Michelada."}
{"text":"Just visiting the area and didn't have a lot of time so we decided to give this place a try.  We are so glad we did. The place is so bright and colorful (and clean), the service was terrific and the people that work there really seem to care about everything (customers, food, service, etc.). I had the traditional burrito, my wife had a chicken caesar salad and my son had some kind of Chimichanga.  The food was so fresh and flavorful, even the chips and salsa were on point."}
{"text":"My first time here and the food was excellent. They have a new customer for life. I had a chimichanga and a green burrito, salsa and chips excellent too"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We thought the chips and salsa were good, they brought out a hot sauce my husband really liked. I had a cheese enchilada and he had a chicken one. The staff was friendly and attentive. The place was brightly decorated and clean. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service,  a rarity these days .  Fresh food with rich,  vibrant flavor.  Really good margaritas!  Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"This place is a surprise when you walk in the door. I expected it to be similiar to the many fast food mexican places in the valley. It is actually a sit down restaurant with servers.

I read the reviews and decided to try. I probably know just about EVERY mex place in Phx. The food at this place is just \"so so\" with the exception of the salsa.  The salsa is very good. The hot sauce is....different.  It's a cream base and is hot but not a great flavor. I had a red chili burro enchilada style. The red chili has a lot of meat but very little flavor. The enchilada style was sparse and I had even asked for extra sauce. My daughter ordered a burro with a filling that included shredded beef, rice, beans, lettuce, and pico. I cannot remember the name of it. She asked for it with NO beans and enchilada style. Again, the ench style was sparse AND her burro included beans that she does not like and did not want. The shredded beef had very good flavor.

Had to give it a try. Not sure that I would be back."}
{"text":"This applies to both the 43rd ave and Olive and the 59th ave and Thunderbird locations. I have eaten at both and food and service are PHENOMENAL. Tonight took the cake though. I called and ordered a meal with a lot of substitutions and silferoto. The gentleman took down the order perfectly and even made suggestions to make the dish better. Great customer service. He then reposted the order to me and confirmed the location. Apparently I had accidentally called the 43rd ave location as it came up first on Google despite the 59th ave location being much closer. I said that I would call them thanked the gentlemen. He then told me not to worry and said they he would call over to them and place my order, telling me I could pick it up in ten minutes at the other location. I went there in the stated ten minutes and the order was just coming out and was perfect. I cannot highly recommend them enough. Best customer service I have ever received and the food is QUALITY. They're affordable as well."}
{"text":"So good.  Great margaritas - Anaya's Margarita - amazing!   great service - and fresh Mexican food.   Chips were warm and brought to the table immediately.  Food was fast - hot and delicious.    Moves to the top of our favorite Mexican Food Restaurant."}
{"text":"Drove all the way across town this morning for pozole.  It was really good, lots of tender pork chunks and hominy.  Couldv'e been a little spicier, but that's just me.  And no flour tortilla - what's up with that?  But I'm glad I checked it out and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food my wife and I have had since we moved up from Tucson. It really made us feel happy to have somewhere we can go like this."}
{"text":"Do you have to be hispanic to go to this restaurant because my husband & I had the worst experience ever when we got take out from there?  My spouse is african american & I am hispanic, we were made to feel very unwelcome there.  The staff constantly stared at us like were from mars and different, no smiles or thank yous just stares.  Worst experience ever.   And an a awful feeling.  We never went back now I know what racism feels like.  Terrible feeling also hurts too."}
{"text":"Green chilli good, salsa good, chips good, beans good, chicken burrito good, pollo fundido good, rice good, chilli relleno  good and a great batch of soda pop.  Portions are good and take out containers are good quality. ..."}
{"text":"My husband was craving Menudo this morning.  Thank you Yelp.  

The salsa, menudo and my breakfast burrito was absolutely delicious!  Coffee was great too.  We are happy to find a neighborhood Mexican Restaurant.  They have happy hour too, yes."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I first tried this little spot yesterday and OMG, it was amazing! We loved, loved, loved the service! The place was clean, the food was fast and the staff were very pleasant! There is a sweet older woman who refills your drinks, she doesn't speak English that well, but the way she makes sure you're taken care of makes you want to come back to the restaurant over and over. Whenever the staff is waiting on you, they are cleaning the restaurant. There was never a moment that I saw any of the employees just lounging around. That makes me as a customer more confident in the quality of the food. Speaking of the food, it was sooooo delicious! They start you off with the chips and salsa, which, I'm a huge wimp when it comes to spicy foods, but that was to die for! ;) Then we were offered the fried ice cream. I've never tried it before but my friend insisted. Like everything else, it's needless to say that it was scrumptious! I could keep raving about this place, but I got to get back to work. Lol!"}
{"text":"This is our New Mexican food place sooo good very authentic & fresh.  Big shredded beef burrito I had shredded beef taco & green enchilada refried beans & rice. Service was perfect and everyone that worked there were friendly like family and caring. Price was perfect.."}
{"text":"wow...what a disappointing visit...in ALL the times we have been here this is the first time we left unhappy.  The ONLY highlight was Martha, she knows what we like, the way we like it and tried to make our dinner as pleasant as possible.  We were sat by the front window and it was extremely warm there, never felt as tho the a/c was on and there was no air movement by us at all and there were no booths available in the shade.  There was a new waiter to us, Roberto, he came to the table, never introduced himself and curtly asked for our drink order.  We ordered our usual a \"bartenders margarita\", he said we had to order from menu, so my wife looked it over and asked for a Hawaiian margarita, frozen.  He came back with the drinks only the drink was on the rocks...she sent it back nd he blended it but it tasted heavily salted, so she didn't drink it.  I tried to order my norm, crispy shrimp tacos but again he told me the only way they are served is like street tacos, I didn't argue and took them. My wife and daughter ordered with no difficulty and no smile or small talk from Roberto.  We are so used to coming here and being greeted so warm and inviting this was a shock to us.  Martha was the one to continually check on us , and we were grateful for that.  When it came time to pay Roberto never even commented on why the margarita wasn't touched nor did he ask if we were satisfied with everything...even if he was new, something should have been addressed about our meal.  This won't stop us from going back due to all the times we have been here with exceptional service however had this been my first visit...I don't think I would be back."}
{"text":"My Wife and I just checked this place out for the first time, and I was very impressed. For the very 1st time, I had a Seafood Chimichanga, and was blown away at how amazingly flavorful it was. You have got to try it. My Wife had a Wet Burrito with ground beef. Both came with fresh tasting rice & beans, but the chips and salsa we had beforehand were probably some of the best. The staff was very attentive and showed they really care. Definitely will be back a 2nd time."}
{"text":"This is a very nice little restaurant. Looked very clean and it was very colorful.  When we first got there we were the first people and then more customers came trickling in.  We waited on promptly and did not have to wait long for the food to come out.   The food was excellent.  The rice had a fantastic flavor.  Companion had some sort of burrito with rice and beans inside the burrito.  She loved it.  I had chicken fundido. Excellent.  Very reasonably priced.  There's also a bar there if you want liquor or beer.  Overall a very good experience and delicious food"}
{"text":"I was so excited to take my family here for taco Tuesday (5/23) since we don't go out often. Please tell me where the word FRESH came from? Nothing was fresh, stale chips, cold stale taco shells, the cheese, tomatoes, lettuce was just gross...I guess that's why our order was out in 5-10min! Just overall very very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent food veggie choices friendly servers Yummmmmm!"}
{"text":"The chips and salsa were tasty and fresh. I did notice on the menu that each additional basket is $1.50. This isn't of the norm,  but okay.  Hubby and I ordered the Chambord margaritas. YUMMY! I ordered the spinach enchilada dinner.  It was fresh and looked very impressive on the plate.  Hubby ordered the New York strip dinner. His steak came out over cooked. He hungrily ate it anyway.  I would go back but hubby is on the fence."}
{"text":"Top 5 on my list, didn't know what to expect but it had the old school charm and decor we like.  Sat down during happy hour, great happy hour deals, but ordered off the main menu, the D also had a bit different taste that what I'm used to and tend to prefer but it was good and really grew on me.  The dinnerit was awesome tasting.  The prices were very low for quality of food, and the service was top notch.  I'll be back again when we are back in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Pros: 
Looking for a new place to regular? Don't look any further. Anaya's is a great little Mexican food restaurant serving up flavors from Estado Jalisco in Mexico. I have spent time plenty of time in Mexico, and enjoyed the different flavors of Mexico. This restaurant stays true to the flavors of the south. They serve up traditional dishes of the Puerto Vallarta as well as other popular dishes found throughout Mexico. The restaurant is quaint, but as festive as you could expect from a restaurant whose roots are from a beautiful beach state. Phoenix offers many Mexican food restaurants to eat at, but many are tainted with flavors of Arizona. This place is an awesome treat for those of us who are seeking a more traditional dish meal like you would find in mexico. If you are looking for a deviation from a chain restaurant you really need to try this place.

Cons:
The only place I find this restaurant to fall short is on their wait staff. They seem to be a little impatient when you have questions or want to share how great your experience is. This can be a mood killer when the service doesn't match the great taste of the food. I mention this because on several occasions the waiters rush off to the kitchen before we can complete our inquiries. The dining area is only about 1000 sqft. It has been after lunch when we visit so it has been slow. I am writing this in hopes that it's owners or management will tell them to be a little more patient and curteous to patrons."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and staff was very attentive. I had the slow-cooked green chile verde which was tender, a little spicy and a good portion for the small price tag. Tortillas were hot and thin and delish as well. My husband has the beef enchiladas rancheras. Tons of flavor! Salsa was fresh and not too spicy so my girls could eat it and not have to drink a ton of water."}
{"text":"Right when I entered the door I knew I was going to hate eating there because of how dark it is inside. Even when we sat by the window it was very dark. They bring out chips and salsa and no plates so you better not get salsa all over you.. The salsa is very spicy I love spicy so it didn't bother me but for others that will attend this place and you don't like spicy you won't like the salsa. The menu is simple and they explain everything. We ordered the cheese Quesadilla for the appetizer and it was very tasty and fresh.. I love carne asada so I wanted a carne asada burrito and the girl said we don't have that but we have carne asada tacos.. Haha why can't you just put that same meat inside of a burrito??.. So I ended up getting some shrimp enchilada or something like that it wasn't that good the shrimp still had the shell on them which was really gross made me think what kind of shrimp are they and how cheap are they? Also I asked for the Mexican soda and they said they just had regular fountain drinks... If you're going to have a Mexican food joint you need carne Asada burritos and Mexican soda.. Place is dark, the salsa is spicy, and they don't got the Cheeseburger of burritos the Carne Asada burrito. Also the tables and chairs are weird.. Only one Waitress working for 4 tables.."}
{"text":"This is such a family friendly restaurant. The salsa is amazing and everything tastes really good. My husband got the tacos el carbon with steak and the steak was so flavorful and delicious. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Authentic flavors and you cant beat their lunch specials. I love their chips and salsa. And they many great falvorful options you can qet quickly whil on your lunch break."}
{"text":"I ordered from here for the first time via doordash. I got the 3 pick your own combo, which was very good, but I am here to talk bean. These are the BEST refried beans I have had in a long long time. Honestly, I'd just come for the beans and chips."}
{"text":"This place was very good!  The chips and salsa were served promptly.  Our server was very friendly.   I ordered the traditional chicken fajitas, and they were excellent!   This place earned my 5 star rating because my friend accidentally left his credit card there, and when he called the next day, one of the waitresses turned it in to the manager."}
{"text":"Delicious little joint convenient to a doctor's office I visit frequently.  Salsa is excellent as were the prices.  Service was fast and food was fresh.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Mexican resturant in the valley. If your like me, whose last choice is Mexican; Well no more, this place has rocketed to the top of my list. The menu has a large selection of entrees. I had the pollo chipotle with black beans and rice. It was presented on a unique 16\" round plate . It was amazing! My lady and I love margaritas, you must try the fresh margarita. Made with fresh lime juice, and agave. Again amazing. Its a family owned resturant with wonderful people and great service. My advise is drop what your doing and go eat at this place."}
{"text":"Anaya's has been consistently very good.  My girlfriend and I have been coming here for almost a year now and never had a bad time.  The place is clean throughout and the employees are friendly and professional.  The chips and salsa they start you off with are amazing.  After having been there several times it is clear the salsa is made fresh as it varies in heat each time we go, averaging on the hotter side.  They have good lunch and happy hour specials and the food is excellent.  The one quirk is that for some reason the burritos vary in size by quite a bit, even when ordering the same variety.  We actually asked the staff about it, who said the chef uses the same tortillas each time.  Oh well, still good food."}
{"text":"I took the Elders here for Taco Tuesday! The taco prices were legit and the tacos were pretty good. We didn't have a wait for a table and we also didn't have a long wait for the food. As other people's food came out, from what I can see, it looked good as well. I would come back here and not just for Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Authentic, and fresh, made while you wait. The tacos were pretty bland unfortunately. $30 for two to eat, meals, drinks and chips. If you want authentic this is your place, but it really lacked that amazing Mexican taste."}
{"text":"This is far from authentic  Mexican food the only thing good was the chips n salsa not ever going back"}
{"text":"Stopped over for lunch while my wife was at the hospital. I had the lunch special with a burrito, chicken taco, rice and beans.  I paid a little extra for the Colorado beef in my burrito.  It was well worth it.  The taco was huge and very good.  The burrito had large chunks of large beef of lean beef that was flavored well. Very authentic and very good.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Totally perfect place to hide! It is in a strip mall, but do not be fooled this place is amazeballs! Walked in from the street side, and immediately you are in Mexico! Totally cool atmosphere, great chairs great Decor, couldn't say more about it! The host was in an especially great mood, sat us down super fast, and then the waitress took over and again great customer service! Got an opportunity to order the perfect margarita,(order the skinny, which is the real deal! Agave, Triple Sec, lime juice and tequila!) Great tequila selection, and amazing Foods, including real Hatch Green Chile items! I got an opportunity to taste the Menudo, no joke, best menudo I've ever tasted! The hominy had a nice home-made taste, a little toasty, super-delish! Got the crispy tacos, and they were just OK., not bad but in hindsight I think I'm going to go for the street tacos next time! I also ordered the relleno, and it was okay, again not bad, and I'll order it definitely again, but it was just ok. The one thing this place is missing, is a good salsa. I tried several that they had and unfortunately they just have a good spicy flavorful salsa that I could enjoy. That however, did not take away from my experience! This is really good food in the middle of North Glendale! Anyway, such a blessing to be able to eat here tonight! If you do one thing while you're in Glendale, come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food you can find in Glendale.  The quality of the venue and price of the food Is hard to match. The menu has a lot to pick from. The salsa and chips are amazing and free. Usually there is a modest selection of beer and the occasional live music."}
{"text":"I tried the chicken chimichanga. It was ok. The fish taco was not breaded like they stated. And you couldn't really taste the fish due to all the onions."}
{"text":"Super cheap taco Tuesday, great service. Will be back, tacos were pretty good, not the best, definitely the best price!"}
{"text":"When I want to feel like I'm back in Rocky Point, Mexico. I come here. As soon as you walk in the door you are hit with the aroma of Fabuloso! The cleaner that they use in Rocky Point at almost every hotel and restaurant smells like and I love it. 

We always sit at the bar. The bar is super small. Maybe 8 - 10 seats. They have a small Happy Hour every day from 5-7. From house margaritas to quesadillas. The staff is always really friendly. One of my complaints is that their salsa is very inconsistent and the chips are always a bit stale. But their entrées are pretty good. We have had a few of their burritos, and recently tried their ceviche. Nothing out of this world but everything seems to be made from scratch and is always tasty. The red sauce is very good, much better than the green. And their signature Margarita is delicious. They make their own Sweet & Sour. 

I believe this place is ran by all family and friends. This place definitely feels like our little Mexico away from Rocky Point."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant.   It is a cut above the average Mexican restaurant.  The decor makes me feel like I'm in Mexico.  They make the best margaritas.  Order the original.    The Chili Colorado is the best I have ever had.   Don't miss the Chipotle Chicken"}
{"text":"They have really great lunch specials. The portion sizes for the amount of money you pay is really good. They also have a very fast service during lunchtime"}
{"text":"The first thing that happened when we walked in the door was the restaurant manager offering us a warm greeting.  This is a very clean and quaint little restaurant.  The furnishings are artistic and he staff was wonderful.  I had a white fish dinner and my husband had carnitas.  Both meals were delicious and reasonably priced.  I highly recommend it to anyone desiring really good Mexican food."}
{"text":"I 've eaten here 2 times so far. A very clean, neat hidden gem. I have had two outstanding meals both trips. First trip, it was the, Camarones de Ajo.  It was seven very large shrimp and a load of sauteed mushrooms in a delicious  butter garlic sauce served with rice and salad. I wanted to take some home but I couldn't stop eating it it was so good. The shrimp are amazingly large and the dish is great for garlic lovers. The quality of the food in this this dish  alone indicated to me that this is a fine restaurant using top quality food prepared flawlessly.
My next trip, based on the suggestion of the waitress,  was arroz con pollo, basically a chicken and veggie stew served over rice. It usually comes with a cheese topping but I held the cheese. It was amazingly delicious to the point of being close to orgasmic. Check that, it was orgasmic. This is the comfort dish my Hungarian grandmother would make if she was Mexican. It will be hard for me to order anything else after trying this dish. 
It was enough for two meals, I enjoyed it a second night at home as much as the first."}
{"text":"When you walk in the place is amazing! Handpainted furniture and very authentic looking. Your eyes can wonder for hours. That is where the magic ends! Our food came out burnt and over cooked. The staff was arguing it was not but when it was re-cooked it was much better. All the plates are really big to hide the fact you are barely getting any food. I guess they think if you spread it around it looks like more. They must have been running out of the proteins because it was used sparingly. My taco maybe had a spoonful of meat. I will say most of the \"bertos\" taco stands are a lot better. We thought if the prices dropped it could be a cute lunch stop but definitely not a place you want to drop cash for dinner. This place is too over priced and the food was no were near authentic!"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible restaurant. Ordered a shrimp cocktail as an appetizer, and then tacos al Pastore. Will serve everything at the same time had my 10 year old with me she was given a plate so hot she could have burned herself on it with no warning from the waitress. Don't waste your money folks."}
{"text":"First time here; went with a friend who had been here before. atmosphere was fun, kitchy Mexican decor, very colorful and very enjoyable. Had the pastor and carnitas tacos... to die for... i had the traditional margarita and my friend had the special house margarita; both were well made and exceptional."}
{"text":"Very clean place
The cleanest Mexican restaurant that I have visited in Arizona, even the restrooms were spotless.
They serve the food in a big circular plates and it looks like they are actually giving you a huge amount of food but it is not 
This is an a authentic Mexican restaurant with great food and service.
Oh and if you feel like having a drink they have a nice bar setting."}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican food!!! I love the pozole. Best place to cure a hangover with the menudo or pozole"}
{"text":"Okay place, took a while to be seated, food was out super fast, disappointed that there were no tamales ready, which was part of the lunch special, overall okay taste. Prices a bit high and service a bit slow."}
{"text":"Good food and great service! Guacamole and chicken were awesome! Highly recommend in the northwest valley"}
{"text":"Excellent Arroz con pollo as well as margaritas.  We'll be back.  My wife had Burrito combo which was also excellent.  Very large portions.  Great find"}
{"text":"Went here for the second time for Taco Tuesday at around 8pm.  First, let's get the food rating out of the way.  It's probably 3.5 stars, so no problems there.  On this particular visit, it was the service that left much to be desired.  I ordered (5) mini tacos, advertised at $1.25/each.  I ordered (2) crispy tacos, advertised at $2.25/each, and a side of sour cream.  What she brought me was (5) mini tacos and (4) crispy tacos... I didn't say anything, as I figured I could take them home for lunch the next day.  When the bill came out, it was over $25.  I was charged $2.00 each for the mini tacos and $3.00 for the crispy tacos!  When I inquired, I was told that because I had ordered ONE side of sour cream, she added the sour cream charge to each and every item I ordered!  I waited for her to correct the bill, and asked for a box.  I never saw my waitress again.  Someone else brought my corrected bill, and 10 minutes went by and another guy asked me if I wanted a box and I said yes please!  Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I was able to leave, but a lot lighter in the wallet than I had initially anticipated and with 2 extra tacos I didn't order."}
{"text":"Fun little restaurant I'm a strip mall.
We have eaten here for breakfast and lunch many times... great food.... super cute decoratimg.
And good service. Everything is very clean and this is just a really nice little spot to eat! Prices are reasonable and margaritas are great!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I wanted great mexican food.. Checked the reviews and this place had them all.. So we checked it out.. Great chile rellenos, triple berry margaritas ($5.95) carne asada.. OMG to die for!!  This will be our go to place. Just moved about 2 miles away and I am already planning a trip back. OH YEAH, ORDER THE FLAN.. AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I find it hard to find a Mexican good place with everything that is so good. We had Salsa, chips, taco, enchilada,street tacos, cheese crisp,rice and beens all so good."}
{"text":"On a recent visit back to Arizona, I knew I needed some authentic Mexican food. Checked out other Yelp reviews and this was spot on. I ordered the lunch special and for $8 (wow!) I got a tamale, chile relleno, beans, rice, and chips and salsa. It was spicy, just like I love it. Best salsa I've ever tasted. Had a good lasting burn but not over the top burn. I wish I could move back to Arizona so I could eat here again and again. Service was quick, efficient, and servers were polite. If you live within 50 miles, go check this place out for delicious Mexican food."}
{"text":"Generally is consistent but today was awful.  Service was poor.  We literally had to wait on ourselves - ask for everything.  We had to send back eggs cooked wrong after we had to continuously show the waiter that they were hard.  My husbands order came out wrong and the chile Colorado wasn't its usual great tasting.  Looks like it was left over from a weekend night which may just be..."}
{"text":"Very good small family restaurant. The traditional menu is great as is the service. The place is bright and cheerful. 

Miguel our server recommend a combination plate and seafood dish. We enjoyed both and his service. We will come back again soon."}
{"text":"Great service, clean, colorful, great Mexican music, large menu and desserts. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place 4 stars but I cannot since the service was not the greatest and the food was good but not great.  Don't get me wrong, our server was very friendly and sweet but just forgetful.  I loved the atmosphere. It was very welcoming and cozy.  The chips and salsa were some of the best I have had with the perfect amount of heat.  The margaritas were excellent. We tried the skinny margarita and the original. Both awesome and strong.  I would for sure recommend this place for happy hour.  Next time I am back in Phoenix I would for sure go back for drinks and some appetizers.  I was not impressed with my street tacos at all. The corn tortillas tasted store bought and the meat was not the greatest quality.  I had the asada and the pastor.  Both were just ok.  I would not order again.  The tamale was tasty as well as the refried beans.  My sweets did enjoy his meal.  All in all this is a nice and comfortable spot to sit back and relax with friendly service, strong drinks and average food."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a few years now and it's our favorite spot for menudo. The food is very clean authentic and extremely tasteful! The staff is very courteous and friendly. You can't go wrong honestly with anything you order of the menu, all made fresh to order!"}
{"text":"Having been to Anaya's about 10 times now, I am overdue for a review! Excellent service & authentic food! My favorite is the enchiladas sonrisa with shredded beef. I tend to always order this but I feel I could close my eyes and point to anything on the menu and be more than satisfied. I crave this place weekly! Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner along with specials for each, anyone with a craving for great Mexican food out to try Anaya's."}
{"text":"This is specifically for experience with a takeout order: 

I called at 1:15 and ordered ceviche. I was told 10 min (should take like 10-15 I get that) 

Went to go pick it up and left at 1:45

Then they tell me they made it fresh. No that's a lie just be honest you forgot my order. 

That is all. 

Ceviche is good, but not $16 good and if you charge extra for chips that you \"add in\" then let me \"opt out\""}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the area really nice staff and really good food there mild salsa is the best and my favorite dish is there chicken Chipotle"}
{"text":"Went today for lunch. The place is clean, nice, service was good.

Food wise...I always order the same thing at Mexican resturants.   I've been eating mexican food in the valley for over 35 years, even back in old Glendale when Lilys existed.  That's how I gage the food and if I like it or not.  My standard order is cheese enchiladas, taco, rice and beans.   Sorry to report, but other than the salsa I was not impressed. 

I still think Ritos, Carolinas, Popos, Pedro's, La Perala certain Humberto's, have better rice and beans.

Not saying I'd never go back, but I'd probably just order a cheese crisp, or nachos."}
{"text":"I moved to AZ about 3 years ago. I've been searching for good Mexican food since I come from a state that has authentic food. For 2 years I could not find even decent Mexican food. Until I found Anaya's! Their chips and salsa are amazing!! Their food is just as amazing!! And best of all it is so clean! I hate going to a restaurant that is dirty. The bathrooms are extremely clean as well. Staff is always friendly and the decor is better than anyplace I've seen even in CA! Their decor is authentic and beautiful!!! Definitely come here and give it a chance!! You won't be sorry!! :)"}
{"text":"Small, colorful, well appropriated tables and chairs, incredible service and delicious food... I must have found Mexican restaurant heaven!!!

I'm staying in Glendale for a few days and wanted to grab some good Mexican food, so I surfed Yelp and found Ayana's, and I'm glad I did.

I walked in the door and sat right up at the small but very BIG in personality bar. Miguelito was right there to greet me and take my drink order, Margarita, of course. By far one of the best house margaritas I've ever had. And... BAM ... all of a sudden chips and salsa were right in front of me. The salsa is perfectly spicy.

When it came to ordering my main, I got the Arizona Chimichanga Verde. Soooo good, the meat was tender, the tortilla fried like no other, and the sides of beans and guacamole were on point.

Not once did I have to wait for anything, Miguelito made sure to always be ready at the right time. And the prices are even reasonable, I actually found my bill lower than I expected it to be!!!

I would definitely say stop in and try them out, I might find it hard to believe that they would fall short on any level of expectation."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious!  We visited Phoenix from MD and happened on this gem our last night and didn't regret our decision.  The staff was friendly.  The salsa and chips fresh.  The margarita strong and flavorful.  The food delivered fast, fresh, and delicious.  I had the enchiladas with sunny side up eggs with shredded beef.  I don't usually like shredded beef b/c it's usually too tough.  Anaya's was tender and I couldn't believe it was beef!  I'm known to be a slow eater, but I was done before everyone at my table.  I definitely recommend this hidden place to everyone who is visiting the Phoenix, Glendale, Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"First time here..... Not impressed at all!!! Very poor customer service!!! Will not come back! Didn't even stay for that matter"}
{"text":"Average, average, average.  Salsa was good but nothing unique.  I got the carne asada burrito loco and it came out piping hot on the outside and cool on the inside.  Was huge, tasted fine, but again....just average.  The guacamole was below average.  My wife really enjoyed their street tacos."}
{"text":"Wonderful menu! We've loved everything we've tried. Get the arroz con pollo (and ask for extra sauce)!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today & it was delish!!  Super service,
Nice clean atmosphere & the hot sauce was SUPER YUMMY   nice to see management in nice dress shirt & slacks ....  Definitely will be returning soon!!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood find. Always good! Granddaughters favorite place. They have kid friendly salsa. Great chips. Good Happy Hour appetizers too"}
{"text":"This was the worst Mexican food restaurant I've ever been to. Please take the time to drive the extra mile to La Perla or Carolinas"}
{"text":"Great people, clean restaurant, awesome atmosphere, fast service, great food, amazing drinks all with affordable prices, what else can I tell you to get you there ASAP.  ENJOY"}
{"text":"First time in and had lunch.  Cute, colorful, vibrant and clean little place.  Food, service and prices were great.  Very attentive but not over bearing. Steak in fajita salad was very tender.  Everything was fresh, delicious and quick.  Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and hubby had lunch special combo chicken burrito, ground beef taco with retried beans and rice.  I had enchiladas de Jaiba (dungeness crab, onion and tomato). Very yummy. Everything fresh and service was fast. Wait staff authentic. Authentic Spanish music played. Not a commercialized Mexican place. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Tried a new place today called Anaya's Fresh Mexican Restaurant. Walking in you have no idea what to expect, but once the door is open you are pleasantly surprised. It's a quaint little eatery with bright colors and a very nice staff. We ordered the Mexican Flag Burrito, the Pollo Fundito and the kids Grilled Cheese. My sexy hubby loved his giant colored red, white and green burrito. It was stuffed with chicken, beans, rice and hearty helping of love. Our son didn't like his grilled cheese too much, super dry and he found an onion hiding in it. 
I really liked the Pollo Fundito. It tasted great and made my tummy smile when I was eating it. It truly was fundito to eato! Tap, tap, tap, is this thing on? Hello...
Great salsa and fabulously warm chips that melted in your mouth. Super good people to spend a leisurely lunch with. 
Support your local businesses...end scene."}
{"text":"Favorite new find! The Chipotle shrimp dish is so delicious and service has been consistently friendly and fast. After 10 years of searching we finally found our spot!"}
{"text":"Before we moved here, we found this place on Yelp. It was by our hotel so we tried it out. I had a combo plate that included a red tamale, cheese enchilada and a shredded beef taco. The tamale was filled with meat and so moist, the sauce on the enchilada was perfect and my shredded beef taco was crispy and had a ton of flavor. I cant begin to tell you how much I love this place. We moved here 5 weeks ago and have been here 4 times. That is a big deal, because we live an hour away. so yes, we take a 2 hour round trip because it is just that good. They also have a great beer and tequila selection and the customer service is always top notch."}
{"text":"Tried Anaya's for the first time last week. Wow!! So friendly and delicious food!! We are definitely coming back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I'm almost sure they know us by name. It's that good. The service is great, love that happy hour margarita price and the food is so yummy! There's a hot salsa and a mild, both equally good. The chips come out all warm and makes you feel like you're family members getting special chips. Love it and that's why we keep going back."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went today and thought it was fantastic!  I had the carne asada plate and my wife had the chimichanga.  Our server was Miguel and he gave us great service.  We will be going back again.  Small quaint restaurant, clean and pleasant."}
{"text":"Excellent service food and decor!  Decent happy hour, but don't stop there.  They have seafood galore for those lovers.  Me the chimi did me in! Try the traditional.  They spent the money and the place is beautifully decorated.  Traditional Spanish music and what's playing on the TV football aka soccer.  We will be back & bring friends! Salsa & chips were good!  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Chips and Salsa is marvelous, ordered the street taco's and they were to die for. Will definitely return.
Chug was our server and she did a marvelous job not to mention she was very kind and considerate, I wanted three street taco and she asked me if I was really hungry, my response was no and she suggested that I only order 2 and that was perfect, I loved that little touch."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the portion sizes and quality. The beans are not good! I got the Pollo fundito plate that had very little sauce and that's the reason I even decided on that 13 dollar plate. Way over priced for poor quality. Just wanted to give an honest review...oh and the mimosa was warm"}
{"text":"Our family had pork carnitas. Fajita style quesadilla and steak and chicken fajitas. It was all absolutely delicious and fresh. The quesadilla has the perfect amount of cheese and veggies to the steak. Wasn't a big fan of the chicken in the fajitas but the steak was the best. I'm not normally a big fan of onions but they did a great job of cooking them. The pork carnitas were tender and flavorful. The portions for all the food!"}
{"text":"So happy we found this place!! The food was fresh and delicious. Amazing pazole & ceviche and loved the horchata! The tres amigos plate was delicious too! Cute indoor decor and great service!!"}
{"text":"The place is tops for vegetarians.  They have a veggie chimichanga and black beans and rice that is vegetarian friendly.  The food tastes great and I grew up with lard in my refried beans and chicken broth in my rice.  The red sauce was great as well."}
{"text":"I was looking for a Mexican restaurant that had good pozole with a lot of flavor, I found this one driving by because I live near it and decided to try it out, it was better than I expected and I can't wait to come back and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"The best chile Colorado I've ever eaten. And yes, I'm super picky with my Mexican food! The salsa is amazing. My husband had the deluxe burrito shredded beef, and he really liked it. Small, busy, friendly, yummy! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The people were exceptionally friendly and courteous. We were seated immediately and got our drink orders. We chose the beef fajita burrito. It came out extremely quickly and was tasty. The meat was seasoned wonderfully. The prices were reasonable and we would go there again."}
{"text":"Good food, large menu. Loved the colorful decorations. Food tasted awesome and service was great. They have some of the best salsa I've ever had. Drinks are strong, cheap, and we'll made."}
{"text":"I come here with my family at least once a month. The margaritas are good, the food decently priced and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing first of all the salsa is among the best have ever had I ordered the three item combo the tamale was moist and the filling was delicious the chili reano was light with a great batter finally the shredded beef enchilada was so packed full of flavor .... My wife ordered the chicken mole enchilada the best mole sauce I had ever had 

Combine the amazing food with a really nice atmosphere and friendly wait staff a real five star jem"}
{"text":"Good food and fast service.
I had the chili Colorado and my wife had the taco Salad. Not over the top but it was good.
We will be back for the happy hour fun....."}
{"text":"Delicious and super clean place. Carne asada was tender and moist. Pozole is delicious!! I will be a regular."}
{"text":"Goodbye Popo's hello Anaya's! Have been living in the area for 3 years and while there's plenty of good Mexican food in the valley I like to have a good, local, sit down option where I can get a good margarita, and good food in a lively atmosphere. I used to think Popo's was that place, but have gotten more and more irritated with that place -- oversized portions, chewy overcooked meat, watered down drinks. Great atmosphere at Anaya's, love the colorful furniture, very friendly staff, the food was excellent and the margaritas very good! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I don't think this place gets enough credit... 

We stumbled into this place about a year ago. I was feeling homesick and my husband brought me here to cheer me up, it worked!! As soon as you walk in, you feel so welcomed and at home. They smile, greet you and happily usher you to a table without delay. Once you sit down, they serve you drinks and chips right away. The whole restaurant is spotless! I really appreciated the fact that when the servers weren't waiting on a table, they were cleaning. The pride they have in their restaurant shows. 

There has never been a time I looked around for a waiter or got upset because they're either rude or because they gave us slow service. They really make it known that they're glad to have you there. Our cups were never empty and when we left, our stomachs were always filled to the brim with such delicious food! The interior of the restaurant is colorful and shows a lot of culture. 

We bring our family and friends here every chance we get! If you haven't been here, GO!! You will not be disappointed. It's very hard to find good customer service nowadays but not at Anaya's!"}
{"text":"First time here. Such a cute little spot. Good salsa and margaritas! Authentic Mexican food and great prices. Going to be my new breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with the family. I love their breakfast options, they have everything from huevos rancheros, to breakfast burritos, to pancakes! The breakfast burrito with asada was really good, and my daughter was able to get french toast. The chips and salsa were also good. The chilaquiles weren't actually my favorite, too much sauce, not enough egg, but overall I'd say it was decent. 

The decor is cute, very bright and colorful. Our waitress was very friendly and sweet. The location in my opinion isn't the best place to get a lot of business, you'd never see it from the street, but maybe if they advertise more it can become more popular. My only complaint was the amount of time it took to get our food. There were maybe 4  or 5 other groups eating when we were there and we waited a good 20 minutes to get our food."}
{"text":"Ordered nachos from here and they were awesome. They took about 10 minutes to make but totally worth it cause they tasted fresh. Real cheese, no gross canned cheese. 

Service was super friendly and the salsa & chips are great."}
{"text":"Good food and quick service. They don't have a very large meat selection, but what they do have is tasty. It's a quick stop if you're in the area and have 45min to spare."}
{"text":"Small but the food is incredible and staff are efficient. Had enchiladas and my husband had carnitas. Servings are reasonable."}
{"text":"Good food.  Great service.  First time visitor.    Prices were good.   Food was very good.  Would give 5 stars but was reserving for beyond amazing.   But, it was excellent."}
{"text":"I love this place this is my and my boyfriend's go to place for a family night. We love it! Food is great! Margaritas are on point and the atmosphere is fun and servers are wonderful. I definitely recommend this wonderful place."}
{"text":"I don't go out to Glendale very often, but while visiting my friend out in Peoria, we decided to try a new Mexican place.  The restaurant seems very authentic when you first walk in (I've never been to Mexico so I don't know how authentic it was).  I ordered the street tacos al pastor as one of the suggestions by the lovely lady who served us.  

I haven't been in Arizona very long but from what I tasted at this restaurant, this is my favorite Mexican place I've found thus far in Arizona.  The food was very tasty and as close to authentic Mexican food as I've tasted.  

The reason this restaurant isn't receiving 5 full stars from me is because of the price.  Each one of those street tacos was 3.25 and to me that seems a bit steep.  I know it's a sit down restaurant as opposed to a food truck out on the street, but still 3.25 per taco and then rice and beans and drinks all on top of that adds up really quick.  I'm not saying the pricing is bad especially for a sit down Mexican restaurant but maybe next time I'll steer clear of spending 3.25 on tacos and order something a little more worth the cost.

I would absolutely recommend this place to friends and I hope to be returning someday when I'm in Glendale again."}
{"text":"Cute, small, neighborhood hole in the wall place. I always get the super Michelada which some of the bartenders make better than others. The pasole has been consistently good. So is the arroz con pollo. Carne Assada is also good.  No soap in the men's restroom. All in all tho a good spot and hope it sticks around."}
{"text":"I love this place, the service is always great and the food it's amazing. I totally recommend the pozole which is my favorite thing here."}
{"text":"came here for happy hour and wasn't impressed. came here because of the good reviews. 
we ordered a few cheese crisps, a couple nachos and some other things. 
the margaritas I liked a lot, had 2 of those. Its hard to screw up cheese crisp but they are not good. over cooked and hardly any cheese. The nachos are ok and the chips and salsa are good.  maybe ill be able to come back and try some of the regular menu items."}
{"text":"I don't normally take the time to write reviews, but had to for this place. Driving north, searched Mexican food restaurants and choose Anaya's. So glad we did. Environment is wonderful. Bright colorful and welcoming when you walk in. Employees are wonderfully friendly. Restaurant is clean, and bathrooms are impeccable. 

Now, the food. I am Mexican and although it is not my mom's cooking it is really good. The Chips and salsas were AMAZING! We had the combinations and truly enjoyed them. 

We will drive the distance to visit this place. Too bad it is so far, the margaritas were yummy, too."}
{"text":"Holy guacamole! This place is like my Abuella's house! The food is so fresh and gives you that homemade vibe. And their salsa, I can't even... It's so delicious that I want to set up some sort of cot and live here so I can eat this food every day. The service is fantastic and did I say how yummy the guacamole is? Because SHIT! It's sooooo good! Please bring your bff here and tell your mom! And text me because we are prolly here already! Fuck. I can't stop cursing because this place is so good!!!"}
{"text":"Fast service. Great prices for a good amount of food. Best part for us was the salsa. It was excellent."}
{"text":"We live right around the corner from this place and I've walked past it a million times to get to the best Chinese food I've ever had that used to be next door(that's a different and sad story). Anaya's has always been on my try list, so we finally went and gave it a shot.

I'm always a little sketchy about different Mexican places than my standard ones, but I was pretty impressed with Anaya's. 

I had my typical first time at any Mexican joint plate: Carnitas (with flour tortillas), and a red tamale on the side. The carnitas was REALLY good, I would say above average at worst. I was a fan. The meat was tender and flavorful. The tamale, on the other hand, was decent, but a HUGE drawback is that the masa layer is so thick I had to peel it away and eat it separately. The filling was great though. I have high standards for tamales, and it wasn't the best I've had.

Everyone else in my party was happy though. We splt nachos because of happy hour that were delicious. Wife had the Fundido burrito with shredded beef and she finished it happily. Brother in law had the Chicken Fajita Burrito; he enjoyed it. The good thing about the burrito plates is that they include sour cream and guacamole that is a freaking ridiculous upcharge elsewhere. Mama had the Spinach Enchiladas. She liked them, but had leftovers to spare.

Overall, it was very good (but slightly pricey) and we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I have traveled all over the US and Mexico. This restaurant serves the best Mexican food i ever had. Ana makes the best margaritas on earth."}
{"text":"Wow!  Best Mexican food I have had. Salsa was awesome. Had a good amount of kick to it. The meal was awesome in appearance and the taste was even better. Ate with 3 other workmates and all of us were thoroughly impressed with our dining experience."}
{"text":"To start, I'll say that we have a group of 6 that eats Mexican food in this area every week and have as a tradition for the last few years. We've tried several places in the past... Found places with great food but terrible service, some places with great service but pretty mediocre food. This place has the whole package. 

The staff is amazing and cares about making their customers happy. The first time we went, we ordered food to go and had margaritas at the bar while we waited... Based on the atmosphere and the drinks (which are amazing, Maria makes the best Vallarta drinks... They taste so fresh!) I stated the food literally had to taste like crap not to want to come back. 

Food is great! We've been back every week since for nearly two months and couldn't be happier! David and Ofelia are both amazing servers... You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was great. Cute and clean on the inside. I had the pollo fundido and he had the chimi enchilada style. Chips and salsa were good. I really enjoyed my lunch. Their website lists 2 locations however the BOGO coupon I brought was only good at the 43rd St location per the manager. She said we could have 50% off one entrée.  I thought that was ridiculous but didn't feel like arguing.  Not the best deal in town for a Mexican lunch but it could have stayed on my \"safe bet\" list if it hadn't been for that. I probably won't be back...I feel the managers decision was tacky and it cost them a customer. There are so many choices for Mexican in Phoenix.  I use the Entertainment Guide as a compass kind of. I have a hard time trying new places unless it's a great deal. Rarely does this happen with those coupons but when it does, I am instantly turned off. Glad she gave me the 50% because it would have been $30 for 2 basic Mexican lunches. That's too much in my opinion.  If I wanna pay $15 per plate I go to Blue Agave in Scottsdale or some place like that."}
{"text":"We decided we wanted \"Mexican\" and decided to venture out a ways from Surprise. I found Amaya's was #1 Yelp rated in Glendale. Check out the photos of their interior decor on their website. Great Mexican decor and atmosphere puts you in the mood. The staff was very friendly and we were promptly served chip, salsa and drinks. My wife's large Margarita and my dark Mexican beer were served in refrigerated glass and mug, nice. Our service was friendly, attentive and always there when we needed it. We loved our food in this spotless family run eatery. We are pleased to recommend Amaya's."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant last night with my wife, immediately got greeted and got a table right away. It was very dim and had a nice dinner setting with some mexican music on. The chips and salsa was really good. Fresh chips and salsa had a nice kick to it. It was refreshing because many mexican food restaurants have steered away from their spicier salsa and this restaurant stays true to it. My wife hates spicy and even she enjoyed it. Food was authentic, tacos were good with nice fresh lettuce and tomatoes. No complaints. If your looking to go out and have some food And to be entertained this is not the restaurant, but if you bring a friend or your loved ones it is a nice queit place to enjoy some good mexican food. My wife did order a corona rita and they hardly put any alcohol in it besides the beer and it was 8$ so that is the reason im only giving 4 stars. Drink was expensive and my wife only weighs 115 lbs and didnt even get a tiny little buzz going. But as for food it was really good"}
{"text":"Great great good, super friendly service. Hidden gem on the west side. My only knock is that the location is not great (located in a strip mall) but besides tthat, definitely will go back"}
{"text":"This place has the most blahhhhh bland Mexican food that I have had in arizona! I have been in az my whole life and know what good Mexican food is . Unless you have broken taste buds do not eat here! Do Valle Luna or Pedro's if you want real stuff."}
{"text":"About our 5th time here. Great prices and consistently great food. Lunch special is. $7 for 2 items and $5 for 1 along with rice and beans and chips. Love their Chile Relleno and the burritos. We splurged and got churros and fried ice cream. Just what we needed! 

Decor is bright and cheerful!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food there is..... Best MUSIC and drinks..... We had the Ceviche.... Amazing!!!! Maria and Rene gave us great service."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service. On different nights, had both the regular and seafood chimichanga. Both were awesome. Shredded beef tacos were very good. Pleasant staff."}
{"text":"This place is a fun twist on Mexican food! The plates are gigantic and has nice presentation for sure. There is some combos you can't get anywhere else that I've been like Pollo Chipotle which is my favorite. Also they have really tasty salsa and the prices are reasonable too! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Food was good but didn't get what we ordered. They changed their Bloody Mary's so they don't taste good and wouldn't order another one. They should resort back to the way they use to make them for they were great and tasted like a bloody mary."}
{"text":"I must say, this gem of a restaurant is hidden away in a strip mall, but don't let that deter you.  Upon entering we were greeted by the sweetest young man.  Within a minute our drink order was taken and were quickly brought out.  Our waitress was helpful with telling us about the special and her favorite dishes.  My husband ordered a combo plate with a taco and an enchilada. He said the ground beef taco was okay but the enchilada was out of this world. I myself enjoyed the enchilada de Mole.  Well I have had mole a sauce before this was delicious. It was advertised as spicy but I did not find it was overly spicy just extremely tasty.
They also serve authentic Mexican breakfast if anyone is interested it looks delicious. I will be trying that very soon.
Can't say it enough for the service and the environment. The restaurant is absolutely adorable inside"}
{"text":"We were one of 5 tables and experienced horrible service. Water was never refilled, neither were the chips and salsa. We had to flag the waitress down to order dessert and again for the check. Between the hostess, chip lady, and waitress it seemed like someone just died in there. The salsa was good and so were the quesadillas but how can you go wrong with cheese and tortillas? I would pass on the fried ice cream it wasn't that special. All in all nothing special."}
{"text":"Was here for the first time today after using Yelp to find a restaurant - and the Yelpers were right! I had the Taco Salad, and was very satisfied. Quite a large salad and tasty. I would recommend this to anyone, and will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times.  I went twice for food and once for drinks during happy hour.  Their happy hour prices are not that great, but I think the food and drinks are pretty good.  The atmosphere inside the restaurant is also nice and cheery.  I really like the ranchero salad with shrimp."}
{"text":"This place was very good. Took a random suggestion, but the service was so friendly and the food delicious. Nachos very yummy"}
{"text":"Small dining room with colorful furniture, in a great location, across the street from the hospital.  We took respite at Anaya's for a good meal before heading home to crash, after welcoming a new baby to the family. The new big sis (2 year old) was being awful but the staff was great. Thankfully, the dining room was almost empty.

We ordered and took turns eating and walking/cuddling the 2 year old in the bar area, as to not disturb the other table in the dining room. Wait staff packed up what was leftover and we were out the door from sit to scoot in 20 mins. If we would have known the child wouldn't cooperate before we ordered, we would have just ordered take-out. It didn't phase the staff at all and we were grateful. 

Delicious fajitas, great happy hour margarita specials and the chile relleno was spot on. No wonder this is the only Mex restaurant my parents will go to, in the area. Love it."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the caldo de res. I live down the street from this place and thought about going in but eh. I wanted some caldo because my soup levels were at an all time low but I didn't want to cook it. I decided to see if they made it there, I  called and ordered it to go. Let me just say IT WAS AMAZING!!! This was probably the best Caldo de res I've ever eaten. The meat was soft the broth was flavorful with just a little spice. It has everything in it. Corn on the cob, zucchini, cabbage, carrots, potato. It was just super delicious . I ordered a large and it could have fed two people but I ate all of it. I would have taken a picture but I was in a soup trance. The only thing I would say is slightly negative is there was no corn tortillas and the carrots were huge. But that doesn't change how I feel about it. They did give me a tiny order of chips and salsa and it was good. I'LL BE BACK !!"}
{"text":"First time here tonight- service was great, food was delicious, and the atmosphere was authentic. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Small neighborhood Mexican restaurant.  Tastes fresh, love the salsa and bean tostadas. Give this place a try ? Good lunch specials."}
{"text":"First time to try this restaurant.  Great food and service.  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Located in a strip-mall just North of Thunderbird Road and 57th Avenue.  The decor was bright and pleasant in a touristy Mexican theme.  The service was very good and the staff were pleasant and friendly and, importantly, the place was very clean.  

You receive a complimentary small serving of chips and salsa before the meal but if you want more you will have to pay a small charge for them.  The chips were OK and the salsa was acceptable.

The menu is varied with a large number of offerings.  The lunch specials are a pretty good deal and you get enough food to satisfy your lunch hunger without overburdening your digestive tract.  

The food was good but not great.  We would return if we were in the neighborhood and hungry, but if I were on a quest for a really good meal I would probably go elsewhere.  It's not the best Mexican food I've had but it is also far from the worst."}
{"text":"Very good,first time here and we'll be back. Arroz cob pollo is great I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place. Great service. I had the seafood soup and it was amazing!  Delicious broth, huge pieces of crab legs, many jumbo shrimp, chunks of fish and scallops. Avocado and jalapeño too!  My husband had tacos, they were OK. Not a lot of meat, mostly lettuce. Salsa was decent but we prefer some chunky pieces of cilantro, tomatoes, onions and jalapeño. Again, the soup was world class."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely  outstanding from the chips to the main course to the desert don't miss this place it's definitely a keeper!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and the food is good. I have been coming here for a few months and their service is always great, very clean restaurant and their horchata is amazing. I have gotten a few different items on the menu and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"First time in here today. I must say for a small place it's very nice. Staff is wonderful and the food is delicious.  You must check this out."}
{"text":"Our family loves this restaurant. We come once a week. The margaritas are amazing and the environment is like being back in Jalisco. Always great service!"}
{"text":"Clean festive little place. We were surprised to find vegetarian options. Good was excellent.  We are coming back here."}
{"text":"Delish food! Got the Chipotle chicken and their chips n salsa were yummy! Fun decor and great service!"}
{"text":"You can tell a lot about a Mexican restaurant by their chips and salsa...theirs was awesome and set the bar high once we received our entrees.  I had chicken mole, gf had combination plate.  Both very good.  Neat decor, very nice staff."}
{"text":"I have been here several times sand I have never had bad service or food. My toddler can be a handful at time but their colorful decor keeps him entertained. The burrito Acapulco is amazing their fajitas are also amazing there is not a Mexican place within 10 miles that I would compare it to. I absolutely love Anaya's and will be coming more often."}
{"text":"other than good customer service, the food is not that flavorful. also, they only provide 1 time complimentary chips and salsa. if you want more chips, they do charge a fee."}

{"text":"We've lived in Mexico,  and we lived in Phoenix for 25+ years, so I think we have a reasonably good ability to judge Mexican restaurants.   THIS place rocks! 

Salsa was hot/spicy enough to disturb one person in our party of three.  We thought it was nearly perfect - chunky,  fresh tasting and just a bit spicy.  DH devoured his generous serving of carnitas.  Our guest enjoyed his express burrito made with chile Colorado,  but did comment that it could have been hotter temperature-wise.  One of my 'test' orders for Mexican restaurants is a chile relleno.  And I've sampled plenty if them.  Gotta say that this was outstanding!  I have a strong preference for green sauce, but this red sauce was excellent.    I'd love to go back and order it again and ask for green sauce.  Heck, I'd just love to go back.

Nice looking place,  bright, cheery, CLEAN, and thank  you for keeping the music turned down.  Ask about the daily drink specials BEFORE you order."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Tex Mex food in general. The Mexican food I do like is limited and I am very picky about how it is prepared. It is never by a chain or Tex-Mex place. I never leave a Mexican place and say, \"Wow, that was so delish!\"(Unless it is by a four or five diamond chef. I know, food snob here) I adore Otro Cafe, Barrio Cafe, and Frank and Lupes and that is about it. My guess it is a dairy and or pork thing. Well, I decided to try this place since it is very close to my new home and I needed sinus cleaning spicy one night. I have to admit I did not hate it. Ha!

The experience did not start well since no one greeted me for over five minutes. Awkward standing there for that long for sure! To kill time I used the bathroom. Weird though that I still waited afterwards for like two minutes after returning from the Restroom. They need a hostess here. Thankfully, things went better after that and the service was great. The waitress was very nice! I had to knock off a star for that though because of first impressions and all and the fact a guest should never wait that long. ( Especially since another worker saw me and did not offer to help me.) 

Now onto the food. The menu here is huge. They have all types of meals and food even some Gringa foods and breakfast. They have homemade pancakes on the menu. I will have to come back to try breakfast. I was shocked to realize I really liked their Chips and Salsa. I am super picky about salsa and I found theirs to be Delish! The Guac was just typical and nothing to write home about, and my Chile Relleno was good but again nothing ground breaking. Still a good find in the neighborhood when the rare occasion Mexican Food craving hits me. 

I liked the colorful,coolly painted and tiled decor.  They also did not have on loud music when I was there which I really appreciated.

To conclude, I am still shocked that I kind of liked this place."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday. 
This was my first trip to Anaya's. My wife has been here several times with friends. One of those things I don't get invited to. 

This is a place I am sure to visit many times. 
The decor is something everyone needs to experience. The chair backs, the dividers are hand carved and painted festive colors. The atmosphere is relaxing, the employees make you feel at home. Aaaaaaand the tacos were excellent. I ate two but one would of been enough. My next trip will be for breakfast. There is so much on heir menu I want to try. 
If you have not visited you need to go see them. You will not regret doing so. 

Second trip was for breakfast on Sunday morning. I have upped my star rating to a five. An indication that we got great service and good food. My wife got the pancakes (yes I know not Mexican food or at least Typical). I got the he scrambled eggs mixed with ham and tomatoes. My wife said he pancakes were very fluffy and good. My breakfast was also good. Definitely a place to return for breakfast. 
This was a very relaxing breakfast. The noise level is low so it is easy to talk to each other. There is nice Mexican music playing in background. We did not feel rushed in any way and were able just to enjoy. 
Already have a third trip planned."}
{"text":"Hope on the wall but really good margaritas and
Guacamole and street tacos. Seems like authentic Mexican food. Try it!"}
