{"text":"This pizzeria has very tasty food. I really enjoyed the margarita pizza and the salads were very good, too. The service was very good, and the waiter was very friendly to me. I also had a nice pinot grigio here, too. I recommend N. 900 for a place to eat at for lunch."}
{"text":"It's not that we were bored of cooking that day, it was that all the food in the house was frozen rock solid. Thus me and the Missus decided to give \"that new pizza place\" a go.
We were both impressed by the service and the quality of the food but what really rang our bell and pushed our foodie-buttons was their private importation wine list. 

What might have been a regular night out was transformed immediately into a soirée de découverte. Beautiful wines matched perfectly with our pizzas. Glee!!!!

We didn't have desert because we were satiated by the delicious pizzas, but let me tell you, that canolli looked awfully tempting!

I think 900 will be seeing us on a regular basis! I just have to remember to forget to take stuff out of the freezer."}
{"text":"I really like this company in general. But my  last experience was nothing short of ridiculous. I have had a delivery several times, yet the last time I called I was told I am now not in the delivery zone. When I asked what had changed, the reply was: we only deliver to people in your area to be nice to clients, otherwise if we are too busy, we don't deliver in your area. \" In other words, it's a crap shoot.  Oh well so much for customer service."}
{"text":"Walked in. Stood around for 5 minutes with a.l bunch of staff walking by and no one cared to ask me if I wanted to sit. Someone finally told me that his colleague would help me out. His colleague walked by me three times before I walked out. 15 minutes waiting without getting service. That's what happens when you have a bunch of 25 year olds running a restaurant."}
{"text":"My MIL recommended this place for pizza so my husband and I popped by one night to grab some takeout. The place is pretty small, but it has a cute little terrace, as many restaurants on Monkland have. The restaurant was full (including a few families with younger children) when we arrived early evening to place our order (Arugula, Porcini with white truffle oil, and prosciutto pizzas). We sat at the bar and had some excellent negronis while we waited. 

The pizzas were lovely. Nice chewy thin crust, good flavours. I just love fresh arugula on pizza.  Note to everyone though: Dine-in if you can, because even though the pizzas were delicious, I suspect that it would have been that much better in the restaurant. I could just see the waiters cringing when giving us the pizzas with all the fresh toppings on the side to be added once we got home. I'd definitely come back to give it another try!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical when my friend suggested this new pizza place on Monkland for lunch....there's sooooo many new pizza places opening and most are like all the other old pizza places (not that great). No 900 is different, it's one of the best pizzas I've ever had! It's minimal ingredients for maximum flavor, not easy to do. The pizza dough is almost a cross between traditional pizza and Indian Nan bread and the result is delicious. Service was outstanding, very attentive friendly staff. It has an almost old world charm to it, like having freshly made pizza in Tuscany (ok, I've never had pizza in Tuscany so I really have no basis for that statement). Definitely give No 900 a try if you live in the Monkland Village or are in the neighborhood, you'll be very happy you did.

P.S.- Take the ends of the crust and dip in the chili oil, mmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Very nice&trendy ambiance. Family friendly. The wait was not long (10 minutes). 
Napolitean pizza oven. 
Good classic italian pizza (comparable to any pizzeria in Little Italy).
Good service.
No complaints."}
{"text":"Just a small cafe with delicious oven fired pizza. We got the \"Pizz Egg\" on the brunch menu. Spicy porcetta with fresh basil and a fried egg on top. Perfect crust and loved the extra red pepper olive oil for the table. Can't wait to come back and try more!!"}
{"text":"I finallllllyyyy got the chance to try n900 after I heard such good things. I stopped in for dinner on their terrace on a Saturday evening. We received a warm welcome and even though it was busy we were able to be seated outside without very much of a wait. We ordered drinks to start white wine and a bourbon lemonade. The white wine was nice light and little fruity and the bourbon lemonade was good but did have a hint of coconut inside which was great for me but may not be the case for someone who isn't into that flavour. The pizza itself was excellent , delicious thin crust pizza perfectly cooked. The pizza was both light and satisfying at the same time. We tried the prosciutto pizza which was tasty and we tried the fig and spicy pancetta pizza with a balsamic drizzle which was by far my favourite between the two. Perfect mix of salty and sweet :) and not necessarily a flavour combo you will find everywhere. My only complaint was the seating outside was a pretty tight squeeze -I would have liked more room between the tables but it didn't have a negative effect on my experience other than the fact that it got pretty loud with everyone so close together but wasn't a big deal. This is a nice place for a night with friends or family or any pizza loving acquaintances really :) but can also make a nice casual date spot. I was very happy with my experience , friendly efficient service , delicious food and reasonable pricing , I'm definitely going back !"}
{"text":"Trendy and yummy!

Came here to celebrate a birthday on Saturday night with a group of 4. We didn't make a reservation and were surprised that it was so empty inside. Though that made me a little hesitant, the cute atmosphere (high tables, marble furniture, and little candles) pulled me in. 

My partner and I shared a caesar salad, a Margherita pizza and another pizza topped with eggplant and peppers. The service was quick and we received the salad within minutes. It was good but on the small side. I didn't try it, but apparently the arugula salad was excellent. 
The pizzas came out shortly after and we both really enjoyed them. The spicy oil adds a nice kick to it. My only criticism would be that I would have liked a bit more cheese. 

Overall, good location on Monkland and perfect for a date or a dinner with friends. Waitress was super friendly!
Food: 4/5
Service: 5/5
Atmosphere: 4/5 (would be 5 if it wasn't so empty!)
Value: 4/5"}
{"text":"The overall concept is great. Authentic Italian pizza in Montreal, but sadly it needs a lot of work. The service was that of a brand new staff with minimal to no training. The wine service was some of the worst I've ever seen,(and I am no pro myself). Forgotten orders and the lack to correct situations where very apparent. 

The staff needs to be retrained and needs a leader."}
{"text":"My parents came to visit, and I needed somewhere to take them that would please everyone. I am really glad we chose here. They were both extremely happy with their pizza. I ordered the truffle pizza, which was delicious. I will say that it did not taste very strongly of truffles - in fact I can't even remember tasting them at all, which considering it was the most expensive pizza it was slightly disappointing. My partner ordered a pizza with pesto, and he wasn't a huge fan of the pesto which I believe is almond based, making it slightly sweet. I do wish that there were more non-pork options - be it either vegetarian or not. Overall, satisfying and fairly quality ingredients, just needs a little fine-tuning to make everything shine."}
{"text":"Belle petite terrasse entouré d'arbres et plantes , bon service, notre pizza fromage chevre et figues tres bonne. Cappuccino parfait."}
