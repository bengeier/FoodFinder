{"text":"Iris is great.  She always gets our order correct.  1/2 price sushi on Wednesday is great!   The food and services is great here."}
{"text":"I always came to Edomae because I really enjoyed sushi. After coming to dine a couple times, I start to really notice how slow customer service can be. After finishing our last meal my partner and I waited 30 minutes until the waitress came to check up on us. We wanted to go boxes but that took her forever. We had to wait for our check so we went up to the waitress and just wanted her to charge us right there and right now. We were the only customers there. I don't see why we had to waste 2 hours.   Few month later a friend wanted to head out for lunch at Edomae. I must say, that was my very last time to ever stand foot in that place. A waiter served me water and after drinking about 1/4 of it I stopped and explained to my waiter my concern. He confirmed that he accidentally served bleach water. I thought it was a prank, a joke, but it surely was. The taste still in my mouth. Edomae you just lost a customer."}
{"text":"The food was ok, and the service was not polite. The hostess was also our server and hardly spoke to us. Everytime I said thank you for anything, she immediately walked away without even saying you're welcome. Maybe I'm just particular about manners, but I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"We live in the area and have been here about a dozen times.  The spring rolls are to die for, full of crisp veggies and not at all greasy.  My husband loves the fried rice.  It has lots of meat but isn't drowning in soy sauce.  The soba noodles are light with a slight spice to them.   The servers are very attentive without being overbearing.  This is not the usual cheesy hibachi grill or mall food."}
{"text":"This was our second stop last week for sushi. We ordered two daily special rolls, a Toro roll and a Tamaka Takki (we think) which wasn't a roll but a special cut of tuna that was broiled.We also ordered an Edomae roll. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rolls were fresh and they had a neat variety. A-OK..."}
{"text":"Want to enjoy a meal with a great atmosphere that is not crowded? Well, Edomae is for you! I believe that it's the only Japanese est. in the Northlake area.  Pros: 1).Daily specials (i.e.  Buy one entree, get one half off) 2).Sushi rolls are great. 3).Great staff...lots of smiles!    Cons: 1).Hibatchi price w/o the experience... (could be a buck or two cheeper). 2).Select menu items that can only be picked for specials not disclosed...so ask up front! 3). Scimping on portions...ordered scallop entree...(received 4, cut in half to look like 8...!!! Who does that??!!) Give it a shot if you like to try new places..."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service and the manager were very rude when we attempted to use a Restaurant.com Gift Certificate. The gift certificate showed it not able to be used for the sushi on special (which we did NOT order), yet the manager wouldn't allow us to use it on menu items.   DO NOT GO!   You will receive rude, un-helpful service."}
{"text":"This place was awful- from the quality of food to the service. We went last night. I asked if the sushi rolls I was considering had chopped fish in them or pieces on top. Well, the server answered incorrectly for both rolls as they both came out the opposite of what he told me.  They brought my boyfriend's chicken hibachi dinner out, and I waited for about ten minutes before checking on my sushi. Their response was that they had a large sushi order before me. That is totally fine and understandable, but they shouldn't have brought out his food when my sushi wasn't even started. I ordered a glass of wine that was never brought to the table. When I reminded the server of this as I asked about my sushi order, he didn't offer to bring it out, comp it, or anything. (I never got it). This place was a big disappointment and we will not be returning. The hibachi chicken dinner was bland, sushi was OK, but with no offer to comp food, give us a coupon, or truly apologize for the long wait and botched service, I'm taking my money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Good place for a quick sushi fix. Clean and good food. Not the best atmosphere as it feels like a fast food diner. But it works for an in and out sushi meal."}
{"text":"Great place for Maki rolls on Wednesday.  We always leave full.  Half price Maki rolls on Wednesday.  They have a great staff. Iris is the best."}
{"text":"Good sushi rolls, good hibachi. Pretty quiet place, except on Wednesdays. They are kind of pricey for the area and what they have (or don't have to offer)."}
{"text":"Our offices moved to the Northlake Mall area about 8 months so we discovered this place and occasionally got lunch from there. I say \"got\" because we no longer get anything. I used to get their sweetheart roll which was good at the beginning but 2 weeks ago got a severe food poisoning from their fresh sushi, I felt terrible for 3 days, lost 5-6 lbs. Now, after sharing mu experience with some colleagues it appears that my poisoning experience is not an accident. Stay away at all costs!!!"}
{"text":"The sushi is okay. The speciality rolls are good but it's not the best sushi I've had by far. The bento box for lunch came with a ton of food and it was all really good."}
{"text":"Just awful. The spicy tuna roll was dismal, no flavor and poorly rolled. The nabeyaki udon was a total mess. The foul scent coming from the bowl was enough to turn my stomach. I'm guessing it was because of the random vegetables  and bland broth. Seriously a can of stock vegetable broth would have been better. I'm not sure why there was so much broccoli and zucchini in the soup. None of the \"normal\" veggies  I'm use to were In the soup. At least the noodles were only slightly under cooked. Though the poor texture clearly couldn't conceal that the noodles were cheap prepackage noodles. Unfortunately I can't even imagine trying this place again in the future."}
{"text":"Good for habchi and spring rolls. Quiet location.  Good service.  Parking is very convenient."}
{"text":"I was not very excited about coming to this place but the hubby was hungry and he wanted hibachi. Lets start saying that there are not many hibachi places close to my house so finding this place was exciting for him. Well, I was not very surprised with the food and the service. The food is ok, but the service is not ok. They did not only forgot to bring our whole food but they never refilled our drinks. I had the Yum Yum roll and it was not so great. My husband got the Steak and Shrimp with fried rice. The fried rice was more like white rice just with soy sauce on top, the steak and shrimp were ok. I dont see myself coming back here."}
{"text":"My wife and I consider Edomae one of our favorite restaurants in the region - surprisingly delicious sushi affordably priced in a comfortable environment.  I mean, what else do you need?  We've gone more than ten times  in the last few years, and they catered my birthday recently.   The sushi is quite fresh - the white tuna is awesome, and the tempura fried spicy tuna rolls are a real value. We are always glad to see folks patronizing the joint - being located in a strip mall near Target, it isn't well placed. But like us, it seems others have discovered what a value it is.  Are there better sushi restaurants in Charlotte? Sure. But none this close to home or this inexpensive."}
{"text":"Placed an order at 4:45pm for a 6:45pm pickup.  Sushi (according to ticket) was done at 6:15pm (30 minutes ahead???)  The cooked food however, oh no, that was ready at 7pm.  So this \"wonderful sushi\" the reviews claim sat for 45 minutes at the counter, i saw it for at least 15 - 20 minutes, while waiting on the cooked pieces.  Considering this is take out,add another 20 minutes until you are eating it, and this is easily an hour of sushi sitting at room temperature.  Complaints welcomed a \"$5 discount on next order\" no thank you.  Ridiculous and unsanitary.  Avoid take out sushi here."}
{"text":"Edomae is a hidden gem in a shopping plaza. The restaurant has a very modern Asian atmosphere. The wait staff was very friendly and cheerful.  I ordered the Bento Box with Teriyaki chicken. It came with a Miso Soup and a choice of Salmon Roll or California Roll -- I picked Salmon roll.  The soup was amazing and so was the salmon roll.  This place also had private party rooms and is very new and clean."}
{"text":"I honestly can't recommend this place. The service was great, but the food wasn't. I felt like I was eating Mall Chinese at hibachi steakhouse prices. I can't wrap my head around why this place cost so much!? The sushi was the best, and didn't make us sick. I may come back for the sushi, but not the hibachi."}
{"text":"I'll give them another star.  I'd give them 3 to average it to 2 if that's the way it worked.  Decent hibachi, served quickly at a reasonable price.  Not really a whole lot more I can say.  If you are thinking sushi, I'd like a higher than 95 sanitation grade, but I'd be down for half priced Wednesday if I was close by."}
{"text":"I moved to North lake area and was looking for a place to replace my old neighborhood sushi place---well I was pleasantly surprised by Edomae. They have excellent service. I like going on Wednesday's when they have half off sushi! I like the spicy tuna roll and the eel roll all for 5 dollars!!!!!"}
{"text":"Meh. This place didn't do it for me.  I met a friend for lunch and we ordered a few sushi rolls, edamame, tempura veggies and hibatchi chicken.   So you can see we had a pretty variety and I didn't love any of it. The sushi was not appetizing and did not really taste fresh. The breading on the tempura veggies was flavorless and the hibatchi chicken was dry. How in the world does that happen?!?   Ugh. Nope. There are too many other options for me to spend my money here."}
{"text":"Felt very rushed from the moment we sat.  Sushi was reasonably good but defiantly not worth going back."}
{"text":"I don't eat meat and this place was my first sushi experience. I ordered the sweet potato roll and it was DELICIOUS! I would definitely order it again. The hibachi was so-so, but I appreciate that the server warned me that their teriyaki sauce has a fish base, so that I could stay clear of accidentally eating fish."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here via pickup using BeyondMenu. I typically go on Wednesdays for half off maki/rolls. Good food that fulfills my sushi craving."}
{"text":"Perhaps we've gone on a few off-nights for them, but we always leave unimpressed and promising ourselves not to go back. Their gyoza are atrocious- I think they're either bought frozen or the filling is made in a meat grinder (you should have some ability to taste what vegetables and meats were put in the filling, not have some mystery paste in a rice wrapper). The salad dressing is good, very mild for a ginger, but one of the saving graces of the meal. Our sushi was terrible; the rice was dried out and unseasoned (for those new to sushi, the rice is supposed to be lightly seasoned with mirin vinegar), and the fish cuts were tiny. They must have run out of cream cheese the other night because they put tofu in my Philly roll instead (um....not the same flavor). I had the shrimp hibachi, and the shrimp were large and properly grilled. I enjoyed the vegetables. My husband unfortunately had the chicken and steak hibachi. He asked for his steak to be medium, and it was virtually rubber. The chicken was dry and lacked in flavor.  Top that off with the horrible service ( it took 25 minutes from the time they cleared our plates until we received our check and only two other tables were occupied), and this time I vow never to return."}
{"text":"Pretty pleased with my second experience with Edomae. I met a friend here for dinner on a Wednesday evening, around 7 PM. The place was buzzing with groups of diners, as well as others waiting for & placing orders \"to go.\"   We were greeted immediately & seated. The lady who seated us told us about the special, \"half off sushi.\" Well, count us in!  Between the two of us, we got three rolls a piece. I opted for the spider roll, spicy crunchy crab roll & the ninja roll. I also got the clear soup. In no time, my soup was brought out & a few minutes later, our sushi arrived. Every roll tasted fresh & the ingredients were delicious.  The place was clean, servers were attentive and efficient. Prices are very reasonable.  They offer hibachi, which I will have to try on my next visit.  Parking is an issue, since they share the area with many other businesses. They do offer reservations (the restaurant itself is pretty small). Another bonus: you can order online."}
{"text":"My second time here, it was a recommendation from a coworker.   The first time I was here was with friends in town and we enjoyed it, it wasn't terribly busy being during the week and service and food was good though the lighting was dim where we sat so one of my friends had to use her phones light.  The second time, tonight, is a Friday night it was just about full and they seemed to be missing some staff.  The table across from me waited on a plate, and maybe it was a bit slow though not enough to irritate me, my gyoza was a little lukewarm though still good, but the tempura was great, and my udon noodle soup was everything I wanted.  The vegetable roll was tasty with a mix of veg.  My friends had two of the seafood rolls and both enjoyed then as well.  It's a solid place to go in my book."}
{"text":"Amazing food and really good specials some times! It is mine and my boyfriends every Sunday ritual to get their hibachi chicken with soup and salad. It is a must eat!"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice.......having sushi both times....but I really like this little spot.  The sushi is very fresh and I really like the choices they offer.  They offer half off of maki rolls on Wednesday after 3.  I tried the spicy crunchy crab meat roll, krayin roll, and carolina roll and they were all well made great tasting rolls, I was very impressed.  It looks like they've been added to restaurant.com also.....fyi."}
{"text":"i am in charlotte for a couple of days on business and decided to stop in  for a bite to eat sunday nite on 3/13/16 and found my visit very pleasurable...the staff was friendly and quick....the restaurant was clean and a nice atmosphere....i had the steak and scallop teryiaki combo and found it very good....pleanty of food and definitly filled me up ! they do have a full bar too in case you may want a cocktail"}
{"text":"Customer service was awful. Waitress took my plate while I was still eating off of it. There were gnats, patched holes in the wall and dried fried rice all over the floor. No \"thank you, come again\", \"how was your meal?\", or \"would you like a refill?\" was said. The only time we were checked on was when we where having our plates that we waited 30 minutes for snatched away although we were the only people in the restaurant and all we got were two very basic rolls. Would give this restaurant a zero if that were an option."}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon & decided to check this place out on a Wednesday night. I made the waitress aware that we were using a Groupon & she told me about the half off Sushi special. We decided to use the Groupon instead. She then pointed out on the menu the things we could order. Even though busy our food came out quickly & was pretty appetizing. When checking out, the young lady took $20 off my bill. I proceeded to show her that's not what the Groupon said. She then became rude & called I'm assuming the manager, who then told me the same thing & that I need to call Groupon & it's a 3rd party & they don't get paid from it. What???? At this point I'm getting upset too, he reluctantly then decides to honor it after reading it himself."}
{"text":"Somehow I felt like the waiter was annoyed. He never offered a refill our waters. The food was tasty but it got cold quick :/ Asked for spicy sauce got sirachi :/"}
{"text":"The food was GREAT, but I tried to order on Yelp for pickup and they never received it. I went to pickup the order and it took 5 people to understand what was going on. I placed my order there in-person. Don't use the online ordering...?"}
{"text":"I'm honestly pushing it giving this establishment 2 stars. Came here for dinner Thursday night and it was completely empty, service was extremely quick presuming we were the only ones AT the restaurant. We are big on all Japanese foods but this night we were in for a disappointment. Sushi was horrible, fried rice was white rice with soy sauce no vegetables no flavor. Never again!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gym over by Northlake mall. My boyfriend took me here for the first time this year and we just went back last week and it was even better. It's not a real big restaurant or extravagant but it's trendy enough and the food is some of the best sushi I've had, even in NYC.  I had the yellowtail jalapeno sashimi which was excellent and had sort of a smoky flavor. We both had a roll as well, the Edomae roll which is wrapped in cucumber instead of rice, very tasty with a lovely presentation. We also had the Crispy Spicy Salmon Roll and Super Tuna Roll. The tuna roll had tempura flakes on top with a really good sauce. Prices were very reasonable too, our bill was under fourty bucks. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My family and I only eat cooked Sushi so I can't comment on raw versions but we loved Edomae. I tried because of a restaurant.com deal and was very pleased. My 5 and 8 year old loved the Yum Yum rolls!"}
{"text":"It's a wonder how two people can have such different reviews even when they go to the same place at the same time sometimes isn't it? Stopped by here for a weekday dinner with my bro bro Jonathon B. and I left feeling a bit neglected.  Walking in reception is warm enough, but that's probably cause one of us is a regular here (not me). My friend ordered a salad and it came out speedily and tasty enough. I've never been a fan of the ginger dressing salads served at most Japanese restaurants though. Probably due to my dislike of iceberg lettuce. Then it took a long while before our sushi selections came out. That's okay because we're chatting it up and being all chill, also we noticed that there was only one person rolling sushi behind the counter for the whole joint. Poor guy! So finally our rolls finally came out and I had ordered a specialty roll and a standard roll. I like to do this because sometimes fancy schmancy rolls either turn out great or a total bust and I need something you can't really mess up as sushi insurance. In this case my dragon something roll ended up kind of meh. Eel is already pretty fatty and pairing it with avocado was just overdoing it and resulted in very little textural contrast at all in the roll. The flavor was decent at least. The crunchy salmon roll on the other hand was great, nice little crunch, fresh tasting salmon, excellent all around!  The service once seated is slooow, I'm not even referring to the speed food came out at since I decided to give them a free pass on that. It took a bit to get our server's attention to order another dish and then quite a lot longer after that to get our checks. It wasn't that busy with only 2-3 tables there so either I need a chill pill or someone needs to get their head in the game. The meal overall was a bit more expensive than I would have liked for a casual night out, let's just stick to Wednesdays next time when the sushi is half off kay?"}
{"text":"I am still searching for something as good as RuSan's and this place isn't it.  You can get some crazy discounts using Restaurant.com discounts - but in my experience with R.com you either get a discount on the most overpriced items ever, or you find places that you really don't want to eat at.  R.com has the occasional diamond in the rough but I have given up on it.  I spend all this time talking about R.com because if you have ever used it and had a lackluster experience then you know exactly what I am talking about with regard to Edomae.  Don't go here, you will leave being minimally satisfied.  If it was dirt cheap I would probably give it 3 stars, but for this price you can do better if you go closer to uptown Charlotte.  The water comes in plastic cups and I am not a big fan of that.  The staff are hard to understand and communicate with.  Nothing will gross you out, but you can't help but feel thoroughly underwhelmed by this place."}
{"text":"I think Edomae is on par or slightly better than Sushi 101. It does not, however, compare to Cowfish or New Zealand Cafe (best sushi in Charlotte!). However, it is better than Akahana in Plaza, Ishi, Nakato, and Kabuto in University area, and Tanaka on Prosperity Church Rd. I feel the fish quality and roll combinations are above par and have good fish combinations. I would recommend their Phoenix & Super Tuna Rolls."}
{"text":"Service was good, atmosphere is the only reason that they got two stars if you love the 90's this is the place to hang out! However, if you are looking for good sushi this is not the place to come too. The music was a mix of 90's R & B to greatest hits. I ordered the eel rolls, I love the eel rolls in California. However, at this place not at all! The avocado that was on top was biter (going bad) the brown on top was covered by eel sauce, once I pulled it off they were a little better, the taste of cream cheese was over powering that was all you tasted, no eel nothing! Would have loved for the waiter that saw what I was doing bc she talked about to other man, but never asked if everything was ok if there was anything she could do. I will not be back! I am still searching for good sushi in NC!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a sushi fix without the high price or bells and whistles. The sushi is good, hibachi is good, soups are good, appetizers are good. My husband and I go here when we're looking for a sushi fix and we always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Restaurant wasn't busy when we visited last night. We were seated right away. I got the veggie spring rolls, they came out super hot straight from the fryer. Thought we were off to a great start , but that was the beginning and the end. I ordered hibachi chicken and the sweet potato sushi roll. My friend also got the hibachi chicken and a philly roll. Sushi was good. Our entree came and it was okay. It wasn't the best hibachi I've ever had. Lots of food however. Our waiter forgot to bring our soup and salad and brought them over the soup was already cold. The salad wasn't too great either. Would go back for the sushi as it was very good but probably wouldn't go back for any meal."}
{"text":"I didn't realize I had been to this place so many times.  I have never had a problem and I appreciate that they have other types of dressing for their salads than the usual asian picks.   Sushi = awesome Service = great Parking = great  I'll go back"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The Lunch special with soup and 2 sushi rolls for under $10.00 is unbeatable. My husband loved the Spicy tuna roll and I liked the spicy California roll. The is express style sushi, you can be in and out in 30 minutes or less and have a full tummy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm just not impressed with this place. I've been a couple of times and, every time, it's been sub par food.  I have tried their sushi and I really did not like it. It felt like it had been sitting out for a while and tasted the very opposite of fresh. On my most recent visit, I tried the teriyaki shrimp lunch special which came with fried rice, mixed vegetables, and choice of salad or miso soup. My meal came with about 5 pieces of shrimp. Now, I'm used to the notion that most Chinese/Asian restaurants do not believe in being \"generous\" with shrimp but I was most disappointed in the fact that the fried rice was not good. It was dry and had no flavor.  Simply put, I was not satisfied with my meal that time or any other time and do not feel like it's a place that I will need to visit anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch - service good - fresh veges. Still not impressed. Seems a bit pricey!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Wednesday with a friend who is leaving town and Wednesday is 50% of maki rolls! I've been here before but I usually get my food to go and eat at home. This was one of the few times I stayed to eat at the restaurant and they were not terribly busy. However, their service was rather slow and it took a while before we could order. The food was good though. I ordered the cherry blossom roll, an order of gyoza, and a side of fried rice. Overall we enjoyed it though the service was distracting."}
{"text":"I was a regular customer until they discontinued the half-price sushi deal on Wednesdays. So unfortunate."}
{"text":"I was blown away by the variety of sushi this place has. The menu is a little overwhelming, but they have bento boxes and combos to help narrow your decision, if you are having a hard time deciding.  The prices are good, nothing too expensive, and the sushi is fresh.   We did not have hibachi this time, but I would like to try it."}
{"text":"I frequently visit this place on Wednesdays for half price sushi! The sushi is fresh and delicious! I have eaten in but mostly carryout. If you order between 5:30 - 6:30 be prepared to wait a little longet than normal, but its worth it! My favorite rolls are the Carolina, spicy crunchy crab, and sweet potato!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the atmosphere is chill but the staff is not very welcoming. The customer service needs work. I had to raise my hand multiple times to get the attention of the staff because they paid me no attention."}
{"text":"Called to order some sushi for takeout. The girl answered the phone and asked to be on hold for a second. Waited for like 10 minutes and could hear everything that was going on at the store. I think she forgot that I was still waiting on the other line. Very unprofessional and terrible service. Waited too long so hung up the phone without ordering anything from there."}
{"text":"One star only because we finally got drinks after we got up and left. My husband and I ordered our drinks and sat there waiting for someone to take our order. The place was super depressing and they acted like we were a bother to them. After we were walked out they were offended because we were leaving because they were taking so long. Never got to try any food but everyone around us seemed to be sitting there in a daze waiting on everything as well."}
{"text":"Happen to be in the area craving sushi. The place was slow. The service was great. Drinks were served promptly and our appetizer was out in minutes. The dumplings were decent. Sushi wasn't the best I've had but decent as well. If I was in the area and craving sushi, I'd go back."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 5 stars but when you enter the restaurant you get the FISHY smells is in your face. Their SUSHI fish quality isn't a good quality. If you want the quantity and not the quality than you'll like it but I don't want to return unless I have to."}
{"text":"I had the chicken hibachi and my friend had the shrimp hibachi. Nothing out of the ordinary with dishes. I also had two sushi rolls(never order sushi to go). It was very fresh food and the price reflected it. Nice side salads but the soup was no good. Portion size was great!!! Had two servings per meal. Will probably return but to dine in for better sushi."}
{"text":"I first went to Edamame around March. I ordered the tekka don dish (eel on a bed of rice) to go. I waited for 40 mins before noticing that an eel order that looked like mine had been sitting on a plate at the kitchen counter for a while. I asked about it and it was mine, they forgot about it being to go. It took them another 30 mins to put the dang food in a box for me to take. I was intent on never going there again, but decided to give them another chance today. I ordered udon soup and some roe sashimi. I got home and found that they gave me salmon instead, after charging me for the roe. Not impressed with the way overpriced food and lacking customer service. I won't be going back this time. I'll just stick to Yoshi's grill in Huntersville."}
{"text":"Been here several times for lunch when I lived in the area, great value and not bad. What I didn't like was the Japanese Techno music..would return"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite sushi spot. Wednesday is half off sushi, which definitely makes it my go-to choice. I haven't tried anything other than the sushi and miso soup but it is always delightfully fresh and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious. I order take out as well as dinning in from time to time. I always order scallop hibachi which comes with soup, rice, sweet carrots, salad, and of course scallop. On this occasion the sweet carrots were missing once I get home, so I called just to let management know. The manager was unsympathetic and said sweet carrots are not guarantee and come with hibachi to \"make look pretty.\" Unbelievable! The food is excellent just make sure everything is in your to go orders. And if your missing anything don't call....nobody will care."}
{"text":"So I gave this place 3 chances and it just isn't that great. The sushi is low grade and definitely isn't worth the price they charge. They do half price sushi on Wednesday's but it's only for dinner and only maki rolls.  They do not do a good job of advertising those details as the websites says \"half price sushi Wednesday's\" or something like that. The only decent special is their sushi lunch special which I believe is $11.99 for 2 rolls and soup or salad.  Although, It still comes back to the point that the sushi just isn't good plain and simple. I really wanted it to be good since it so close to my house but every time I've been disappointed!"}
{"text":"The sushi was pretty good.  But service was poor.  I was overcharged because they got my meal wrong and did not take responsibility for it.  If ordering more than one sushi roll I suggest asking how many rolls are on your plate before eating, they tend to put everything together if u come in with more than one person.  In my case I ordered 4 rolls they put 6 on my plate but u could not tell it was 6 rolls therefore when the check came I found out I was overcharged.  So be aware of this."}
{"text":"Good, affordable sushi.  Great service.  Interesting techno music choices.  And, when I say interesting, I mean who expects to hear Public Enemy mixed with I don't know what electronica at a sushi house?  Definitely going back..."}
{"text":"Well, I'm moving my rating for Edomae up one star. I've been back a lot of times now and it's kinda growing on me. The staff is nice but I still get that rushed feeling. I found out about Wednesday night half off sushi and it keeps me coming back. They know me so well it's like they reserve a seat and a Sapporo at the bar for me every Wednesday night now. And despite saying I'd check out an entree, the sushi has grown on me quite a bit and I wouldn't have it any other way."}
{"text":"Small restaurant - nice for a quick bite. The staff was nice. I wouldn't make this my go to sushi/hibachi spot - i believe they have special on Thursday's"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. To put it as nice as possible this place sucks. The service sucks. The soup tasted and smelt just like dish water and the staff couldent care less. If my food was this bad i would never try the sushi. Probally would end up sick. I regret i gave them money once and would never make that mistake 2 gross"}
{"text":"I order from here almost every Wednesday (half off maki rolls). They have a solid selection of. rolls and they're always well made. The price is quite fair, and they have a really good lunch combo with miso soup and 2 or 3 rolls. The service is pretty fast, whether table service or ordering online. My only complain is when online ordering, they don't look at the 'special instructions'. Not a huge deal, but it would be nice if they read it. I don't think my request is difficult by any means.   I've read some reviews where ordering online was an issue. I order online every week via BeyondMenu and they have always received my order.  If you want fast, inexpensive, tasty, well-made sushi in a casual spot, check out Edomae."}
{"text":"Great sushi and service. I love this place. Fast and friendly service. I had the hibachi shrimp and steak. My husband had the teriyaki salmon. The food is amazing. Definitely a place to take your boo and or your family. Something for everyone."}
{"text":"I've been here for the first time about a week ago and I have to say the atmosphere was really nice, service was pretty good, but the food was horrible. I had got shrimp tempura and spicy tuna rolls and they were both nasty. I eat sushi all the time so I know what it should taste like. I won't be coming back though."}
{"text":"My Saturday lunch buddy, Ceretta, and I stopped by on a Saturday. I had hibachi shrimp. She had hibachi shrimp and scallops. Their fried rice was really good. I ate everything on my plate. The taste was typical hibachi. Nothing special. My only issue is that they were skimpy with the shrimp, 5 piece and they weren't Jumbo shrimp. The prices are slightly less at lunchtime, but they could stand to add 2-4 more shrimp. The service was adequate and they were patient when we took a more time than normal to order. Overall, I'd recommend Edomae. No surprises for the better or worse."}
{"text":"Not that good. Food kind of bland. Ordered shrimp hibachi and they asked if I wanted rice or noodles. I said noodles and was charge $1 extra. No where on menu did it said there was and up charge for noddles. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Not great or grand unfortunately.  The sushi sounded good but was just okay.  The teriyaki chicken was bland.  The best thing I had was the ginger dressing on the salad.  I was hoping for so much more. A waste if $50."}
{"text":"Nice clean inside and it's close to shopping malls.  I came in for lunch only and was disappointed with the Sashimi lunch.  First the lunch comes with traditional Miso soup that tasted like water.  Next the fish was not very good.  When I order Sashimi plate I do not want fake crab or egg on the plate just raw fish.  I finished my lunch because I was starving after a good workout, but will never return."}
{"text":"Traveling through Charlotte on my way to points north, and then back home to Atlanta, I had the pleasure of dining at Edomae twice in the last two weeks.  Located conveniently close to my sister's home, it was an easy dining pick since we all love sushi.  But if you don't, there are plenty of thoroughly cooked items on the menu to enjoy, including a large hibachi grill section.  The edamame is a nice starter, although the second time it was a tad on the salty side.  No worries, since Edomae recently secured their liquor license and they offer beer, wine, and sake.  If you're a sashimi fan, you won't go wrong here.  The fish I ordered tasted fresh and the quality of the sashimi and sushi is higher than the fish used in the rolls.  Not that the rolls are bad - not at all - but if you're like me, you'll get the sashimi appetizer along with one or two of your favorite rolls and call it a meal. I'm partial to eel, but the tuna rolls are also quite good.  Edomae has a long list of special rolls, and some work better than others, but every one I tasted was good.  My favorites include the Naudy Roll (made with eel, tuna, avocado) and the Green Dragon Roll (eel, cucumber, and avocado).  My sister likes the Krayln Roll (Tempura, scallops, asparagus, and masago).  I didn't try any of the hibachi dishes, but the chicken and scallops looked appetizing and were served with soup, salad, vegetables and a choice of fried rice or noodles.  A huge amount of food, reasonably priced.  If you're in the area, this is definitely a place to check out for lunch or dinner.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"this is one of my favorite spots to eat at. i love the shrimp& broccoli lomein. the noodles have a slight sweet taste"}
{"text":"I was at Northlake and had a sushi craving, and had heard about Edomae. Upon arrival I was seated immediately, which I expected since there was only one other table seated. I ordered the \"Phoenix Roll\" and A lunch Bento Box. The roll was good, however extremely spicy, which was a little overwhelming. The bento box included shrimp and vegetable tempura, which was great! Overall, it was good, but not my top sushi choice."}
{"text":"Short review here.  Half price rolls on Wednesday. Yes! Were they good? Yes! Would I return? Yes!"}
{"text":"I have seriously never been to an Asian restaurant where they would not add tofu to a veggie stir fry dish! They charge $12 just for small teriyaki tofu portion, rice, and a sad little ginger salad. I asked them if I could add tofu to the veggie stir fry and they refused! That is bad business, who are you trying to kid? Tofu is literally the cheapest protein you can buy! Lol! An organic tofu block is $2 sometimes less and I know you're not using organic, lol! So you're getting your GMO tofu for pennies and you're trying to sell it for $12! Lol! Your restaurant is a joke! Not to mention there is hair and dust everywhere and it reeks of rotting fish! Dust and hair even on the plates of food and they serve greasy spring rolls that drip oil and they only contain cabbage! Another cheap filler you're charging way too much for!   If you like being ripped off eat at this nasty, dirty, overpriced restaurant and I hope you enjoy rude ass service and watered down tea!"}
{"text":"Service today was great and the sushi was even better.  I enjoyed the Lobster King Crab roll along with a Sweet Potato roll.  I enjoyed eating all of the Lobster and it was quite tasty, not artificial.  Only several tables were full on this early Saturday evening.  The restaurant had a 90.5 rating but we wanted sushi so we stayed.  I looked up the report and there were violations for employee behavior (not washing before putting on gloves; using the gloves to open doors, etc. along with other violations that I attribute to lack of tracking).  I hope the management learned the lesson and will not allow these behaviors to negatively impact their score."}
{"text":"Nice and clean, friendly staff, sushi was very fresh. went for lunch and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Lunch specials at Edomae are great. I typically stick with the hibachi chicken. Their ginger salad is my favorite! I have had a few sushi rolls and liked them all. My only complaint is that the service is sometimes slow even when there aren't many people in the restaurant. I will continue to go though because the food is good."}
{"text":"~~ here we go with another one of my long reviews! :)  ~~ Ok kids, I'll admit that my expectations of this place were kind of low going in. I just assumed it was another one of these \"wanna be\" Japanese express-style places, that survive solely on location since good Japanese restaurants aren't plentiful in Charlotte.  However, I must say I was pleasantly surprised by Edomae.  They're no Kabuto, but they'll suffice.  The interior was surprisingly non-theme-y....you know, where it looks like they just vomited all the obligatory kitsch they could find thinking we as the public somehow won't believe that we're eating Asian food if we aren't looking at all the golden swing-arm cats, bamboo calendars and kimono drawings they could find.  Instead, it was very contemporary, with juuust the right amount of Asian flair mixed in.  I appreciated that - good job!  The men's room was also nice with decorative mosaic tile work like a home bath and very very CLEAN!!!  May seem strange to talk about the rest room, but you know how THAT can go; at a lot of places you don't really wanna touch anything & the endless caulking around the sink is growing mold!  I see you shaking your head :)  Anyhoo, let's move on to the FOOD.  It was quite yummy I must admit.  My partner and I both enjoyed our lunches.  I had the chicken & shrimp hibachi combo and he had the chicken & steak combo.  Each came with rice and a salad (which automatically comes w/ginger dressing, but you can get another type if that's not your thing).  We also shared a Miso soup which was quite yummy with bits of seaweed and tofu.  I went with the ginger dressing as usual & found theirs to be a bit on the sweet side (I like a bit more of that ginger 'kick'), but it was still tasty, and they add cucumber in their salad instead of just lettuce.    The real disappointment here was their portion sizes - rather small for the price.  For instance, I only had three shrimp on my plate...three.   A half-way decent amount of chicken.  The veggies were also rather miniscule as well.  The other half said his well done steak was really quite tender & tasty, but would have liked more.  For about the same price ($11 for mine) I get QUITE a bit more at Kabuto (University location); there's no room to move the food around on the plate there, whereas here there was LOTS of room on the plate.  Sure the flower was nice to look at, but...    Oh, I almost forgot.  I thought this was a cross between funny and odd - they bring a syrup container full of shrimp sauce (you know, the pink dipping sauce you always get), but the sauce is so thick it was very difficult to get it OUT of the container!  An IHOP style container of shrimp sauce was just too funny to me.    Would we eat here again?  Yes (primarily b/c of convenience since it's close to the house.  Is it worth the price?  Eh, not really, since most every other place gives much more food - BUT, if you're in the Northlake area & are craving Japanese, then it IS a good option."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised. They are in what is essentially a snack strip mall tucked away across form target. The service was a little on the slow side and a couple that say after we did somehow got their food first. Overlooking that, the sushi lunch was very fresh and tasty. For $12+tip I got 6 pieces of sushi and subbed a salmon avocado roll. The miso soup they brought out first could've been a little warmer but overall everything tasted pretty good. They don't tell you but you do have to pay at the front."}
{"text":"Delicious food, lots of vegetarian options (LOVE the sweet potato rolls with sweet ponzu sauce!), extremely friendly staff, reasonable prices, short wait times and plenty of parking out front.  One of my go to for lunch and sometimes takeout.  I also like this place because it's one of the non \"chain\" options in this part of town."}
{"text":"This is what the office had picked for lunch one day and while I was so happy to get a break from what we normally get, I must admit the food was just okay.   We ordered ahead for pick up and still had to wait past the allotted time that they said the food would be ready in.  I ordered the bento box and my veggie tempura was alright. Not very crispy and a little oily but decent none the less. My tuna rolls were just that. tuna rolls. Nothing too impressive. The beef was tender but a bit bland."}
{"text":"This place has a nice selection of fresh sushi.  They have good  eel, spicy crunchy salmon roll,  lobster roll, the sashimi salmon was fresh & tasty.  The service can be a bit of a challenge, mainly because some are english challenged. After asking several times about the Bento Box, we decided to go a la carte.  The dining room is nice, more on the upscale casual side. They have a small but nice  bar area and a sushi bar as well.  It's in the area next to the REI store."}
