{"text":"Came here with a friend a few days after it opened. First impression was that the interior looked like an office, not a restaurant. We were seated quickly only to be informed that there was no rice bowls or appetizers available, only ramen. This was fine as we only intended to try the ramen.   We placed our orders and waited.. and waited.. and waited.. service was the slowest I've ever experienced in my life. We were honestly thinking of leaving after waiting 30 minutes. We asked the waiter about our food and was told that it was coming up next so we waited another 15 minutes before it finally came. Broth was warm, not hot, and the overall appearance didn't quite match those I had seen from the Gagana in Japan. The taste was also nothing spectacular.  I've definitely had much better ramen at another place in Calgary so all the rave about this restaurant was really disappointing. The only Gagana we'll be going to will be the one in Japan."}
{"text":"The food here was lovely and SO fresh. For appetisers we had the gyoza dumplings and kaarage chicken. Both were served hot and tasted absolutely wonderful. The chicken was juicy and definitely worth trying. My husband loved it so much he then ordered the entr√©e of it. I had the tonkotsu ramen. This was VERY traditional in flavor, and perhaps not the best thing to start out with here if this is your intro to Japanese food outside of sushi. The broth was rich, heavy, flavourful and perfect. Broth was apparently made in a process that takes more than 12 hours in house. Service was great, we were given a jug of lemon water right away. The waitresses were kind and sociable, though possibly new to serving, they did great.  Start with kaarage chicken if you're not very open minded. It's wonderful for all tastes."}
{"text":"I ordered #4 today. Chasiu was nicely seared and flavourful but not very generous. I got very thin slices. I expected much from the broth but I got so dissapointed. Broth was thick, yet not very tasty. Noodles were generous and it tasted alright... Service was good though. I'm not a returning customer."}
{"text":"I felt like ramen and this was close to the airport so I decided to give it a try because of the good reviews. I ordered the chicken karaage to start - which was great, seasoned well and had some fatty parts so it was tasty. I also ordered the Spicy Miso ramen and in all honesty is was just fine but nothing to write home about. The broth was good not great but the ingredients didn't have the freshness and pop that I've had at other ramen places in town. The noodles seemed almost out of the box because the texture wasn't to my liking but that could be my preference. Also not really sure why cabbage was included(?). Overall I had a pleasant experience, I would say if you're in the area give it a try but if you can drive another 10-15 minutes then you would probably get a better ramen experience elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's not ramen. It's a very bad canned broth mixed with noodles with real chasu on top. Doesn't deserve 1 star in terms of food. Good service though."}
{"text":"Taking over the spot from one of my favorite indian buffets, Gagana Ramen is a welcome change to regular eating digs. Staff are wonderful, food is great and the prices feel fair.   It's some of the best ramen in the north part of the city and are open late enough to get dinner even though I work the late shift."}
{"text":"Stopped by to try the tsukemen. This is very close to the ones we've had in Tokyo. Noodle was appropriately thick with good chew (perfect for dipping). The meat was very tender and the broth was rich with bonito smokiness. We will be coming back for sure.  Service was also on point. The hot bonito broth added to our dipping bowl at the end was a nice authentic touch."}
{"text":"Great ramen!!! Homemade broth, homemade noodles. Can't say enough good things about this place. Nice change of taste to the ramen places around town making and charging for average ramen. Price is fair. Serving size is huge! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the chicken karaage was tasty and came with two dipping sauces.  The katsu curry bento was just okay. The curry sauce was very runny. It should be more stew like in consistency. Otherwise it tasted satisfactory. The Ramen was also just okay. It just didn't wow me at all. I can get better tasting Ramen that's alot closer to me.  In conclusion, if you work or live in the area then give it a try. As for me, I won't drive the 25 km. to get my Ramen fix."}
{"text":"Pho broth: filling, rich and delicious if you like it with a fish base. Heavy though, so come hungry.  Noodles: great texture.  Pork gyoza: crispy, nicely browned skin and decent filling 4/5 Green tea: not good and not free  The extras in the soup such as veggies and chilli flakes were good.  Service at night was good and prompt. Nice touch to offer you mouth wash in the bathroom after your meal! Location: a bit out of the way and in an industrial part of the city. Not the most appealing but worth the drive for food."}
{"text":"I ordered the Tsukemen dipping noodle and it was good i did not find the sauce to peanutty nor salty. the soft boiled egg was a bit on the cold side. the cabbage was a little to big and a lot of it. they should of added shredded carrots and the cucumber slices could of been shredded so then that could be mixed into the noodle. The whole noodle dish temperture was cool, not a hot dish, no seaweed is served with this dish. the Chicken Karaage was fried lightly and has 2 dipping sauces which i enjoyed. the service was good the waitress was pleasent and asked if i wanted her to explain how the noodle is to be consumed. she also offered broth to add into my dipping sauce so i can drink it. she also told me that their sauce was salty. which i found it was ok. the sauce is thicker then expected, but ok"}
{"text":"Great food. Soup is very rich but not too salty. No msgs. And the BBQ pork is to die for. Go check it out."}
{"text":"A few of us came to try last Saturday after hearing that this is a chain from Japan, so I thought it should be very good.  I would say it was only ok. I had the tonkotsu ramen as the safe, basic choice and wasn't wow'ed.  The noodles are the round, yellow kind which I felt was too thick.  It would be ok if the broth wasn't so rich, fatty and also heavy - there were actual chunks of fat in my broth and I thought it was just too much.  This is coming from someone who loves pork belly too! The char siu was nicely fatty (lean char siu sucks) but was missing that good sear.  This was not a bad bowl of noodles but overall I didn't enjoy it.  The gyoza was pretty standard and the chicken karaage (free!) was lightly fried and flavorful.  Service was excellent though which is why I am giving it three stars.  Our server was very attentive and courteous.  The other server saw my frustration when I was trying to get the kids to stop watching tv and eat so she offered to turn it off, which I completely appreciated.  She was friendly and chit-chatted with us as we settled our bill.  She also told us of their current promotion where if you order two bowls of ramen, you get a free appetizer (choice of edamame, seaweed salad or chicken karaage).  Order four bowls and you get that plus 10% off your bill.  Prices are pretty fair so do come and give them a try and see if this style of ramen is what you prefer."}
{"text":"Stopped in the other day.  Had the spicy miso ramen, and it was delish!  And what ever ramen you get you have to have an egg in it.  Have it added if it's one that doesn't have one.  As they are perfect.    Also as they are starting out they have a stamp card for every ramen you get.  We already earned a free appetizer can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is probably the best ramen place in the city. The broths are flavourful and the toppings just right. The prices are very reasonable and they have a great stamps rewards program!"}
{"text":"I will start with the reason I'm giving them 4 stars vs. 5. I just didn't like the broth. And that's not to say it was bad, I'm sure it wasn't, it just wasn't to my liking. I found it way too \"fishy\". So on to my review!   My boyfriend and I have been spoiled by delicious ramen in Edmonton at Prairie Noodle so I was intrigued to try this new ramen place that opened up by my work in Calgary. Gagana is an authentic Japanese ramen place and definitely not fusion. Their menu is nice, small, and uncomplicated. (the way It should be.) They gave us a free chicken karage appetizer and it was AMAZING, I would go back there just to have that. We also had the pork gyoza and they were REALLY good. I am pretty judgemental of pork dumplings and these ones were fantastic and not greasy like they can be.   My boyfriend ordered the spicy miso ramen, and his first comment was \"for someone who REALLY loves miso, this would be amazing\"  so the miso is miso-y folks lol. But in all seriousness it was pretty good according to him, I didn't try it.   I ordered the tonkontsu ramen. The bamboo, pork and the noodles themselves were fantastic. The noodles had a really nice \"chew\" to them. But, like I said above, the broth was just WAY too fishy for me. I might order the dipping ramen next time to avoid the fishy broth and then I think I'll like it a bit better, or I might try one of their rice dishes!   I would definitely love to go back and try some other things. Their food is done very well and their customer service is amazing, just because I didn't like the flavour of the broth doesn't make it a bad experience that's for sure."}
{"text":"Was mediocre at best. The broth was too sweet for me. Both my friend and I didn't finish our bowls. During lunch, they had a special for a free appetizer with our meals, we got the the chicken karaage. It was okay, I think if they adjust the broth a bit, it will be a hit."}
{"text":"I like to think I know a thing or two about proper ramen. I eat it often and prefer more authentic bowls over some of the fusion stuff that you find out there. Having said that I have eaten here four times and have had the chance to sample most of the menu. Each time has been a very different experience so consistency is lacking...I have had some ramen that I quite enjoyed and some that I didn't even finish, but never any that were top notch. The spicy miso and dipping ramen are probably the best options for ramen here, and have never disappointed me. I wish I could say the same for the tonkatsu...but alas...if you love classic tonkatsu ramen, DON'T ORDER IT HERE. The pork in the broth is overpowered by the fish and soy they add, the consistency is too thick, and the color is too dark. This is not tonkatsu ramen. On a positive note, the pork gyoza and karage chicken are awesome."}
{"text":"The host is super attentive and nice. We had the ramen noodles. I found it mediocre in terms of the taste. The noodle itself is also a little different from most other places I've had around Calgary. Overall, it's alright but I probably won't visit again. Thank you for the good service though!"}
{"text":"I should've listened to my gut and go to Muku instead. Gagana serves the weakest ramen I've had in Calgary thus far. The flavor is weird, and the portions are stingy.  One good thing I have to say is that the karaage chicken is very flavorful and delicious.   The ramen, however, needs a lot of work. You could tell it was creamy, but the flavors were just wrong. The menu said they stew meat bones for many hours, then mix katsuoboshi and fish flavorings afterwards for umami. The fish flavor was too strong and made the broth unappetizing. There was no umami, just fishy fish fishness. Not only just, the cha shu was paper thin, and they were not generous with the toppings.   I think if I return to Gagana, it would be for their karaage chicken. You can pass on the ramen and get real fish at sushi instead."}
{"text":"Wow! Ramen in Calgary just keeps getting better and better. I ordered the Tsukemen which is hot noodles dipped into a thick house-made broth. I've never had ramen like this before so it was an interesting experience. The consistency of the broth was closer to a stew.  I loved the broth as it was the best I've had in Calgary thus far (I keep saying that...). It had a rich and flavorful seafood taste with a little bit of sweetness. Turns out that they use pork and fish bones in their broth for the Tsukemen. The broth is really strong if you have it on its own but the thick noodles work well with the rich broth.  Noodles were cooked perfectly (al dente). What I really liked about this ramen was that despite being a \"dry\" dish, the noodles didn't stick together so when you dip them, they were coated with the thicker broth and you don't get clumped noodles. I found out later that the noodles weren't made in-house but from their own company. The char siu was perfectly grilled. It wasn't fatty and the flavorful meat was tender. I still prefer Shiki Menya's char siu though. Vegetables were plain as the bowl only had lettuce and cucumber.  From what I've read, Gagana is a Japanese franchise so if they could make ramen this good, it makes me wonder how it tastes at a local Japanese shop. Price is comparable to most other ramen shops in town ($12 and $2 for extra noodles)."}
{"text":"Ramen time!  Came here on the recommendation of a friend. During today's visit we had a limited choice in items to choose from. No rice. With is fine cause I came here for the ramen anyways.   I got the tsukemen and the hubs got the tonkatsu ramen with extra char siu. We also got the pork gyoza to start.   The pork gyoza came out quite quickly. The bottoms were perfectly crisp and the fillings were still juicy. One of the better pork gyozas I've had in YYC.  The noodles didn't come with the seaweed that'd suppose to accompany it :( it's one of my favorite parts when I eat ramen too. The noodles here are on point though (both the ramen and tsukemen). I've been looking all over YYC for a place with noodles that are on par to Japan, this place comes very close.   The tsukemen doesn't stick together in the bowl like some other ramen places, the dip was a bit strong for me (very thick). The server gave the option of adding fish broth to the sauce so that it could be drinkable. It was actually quite tasty once she added the fish broth.   I overheard one of the servers saying that they don't do takeout here as it changes the quality of the noodles; they also offered the same table a new bowl of noodles as the person it was ordered for hadn't arrived yet. Very cautious in regard to their quality. Much applause.   Looking forward to our next visit here to try their shrimp shoyu ramen."}
{"text":"I have come here multiple times and every time the service was friendly, prompt, and efficient. The menu is small but has some of the best ramen I've had in the city.  The soup has no msg which is a bonus and quality is always consistent.  I love it here."}
{"text":"I've been to Gagana Ramen three times now.  Every time I go the restaurant improves.  The first visit they neglected to make rice in time so the rice bowls weren't available.  That was no big deal since I was going to order the ramen.  I tried their spicy miso ramen and was quite impressed with the flavour of the broth and noodles.  We ordered the pork gyozas as well.  They were nice and golden on the outside and hot on the inside, not soggy at all.  The staff were very accommodating, friendly and able to offer advice to my ramen challenged lunch mates.  The food came out a bit slow but I'll chalk that up to having just opened.  The second time around I went alone and ordered the spicy miso ramen again (can you tell I'm a fan?).  The service was wonderful, my water was always topped up and they checked up on me after the first few bites.  The food didn't take as long as last time to come out.  The third time I was really pressed for time and I asked if they could rush my order.  This time I wanted to try the karaage (Japanese fried chicken) rice bowl.  There was a generous helping of rice, veggies and a chipotle style mayo on the side.  The rice was quite moist however I think the bowl overall was a tad bit too dry for me.  I guess it's back to the ramen next time!  They rushed my order and I was in and out in less than 30min.  Thank you!!  The restaurant is very casual and looks like there had been some renos/updates since the conversion (previously an African eatery).  I'd say this place would get 5-stars if it had a little bit more decor (i.e. art on walls) and better spot lighting for each table.  Update: I went in again today, the food came out a bit faster than before despite having a fairly full dining area.  They now have Japanese art on the walls!!!  5-Stars!!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was nice and clean. The staffs were helpful and friendly. Possibly the best ramen I had in Calgary."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend. We had the tonkotsu and tsukemen ramen with the fried chicken appetizer. The appetizer was free with the punch card!  The fried chicken was excellent. Tonkotsu was great in my opinion, large bowl to maximize surface area for eating with just enough of everything. My friend thought the tsukemen was only ok. Will probably return another time!"}
{"text":"I felt like having ramen, I was greeted and she told me right away that hey were so busy today that they run out..I'm happy to hear that coz you know that they have set amount and the quality control is good. So I end up having gyoza and the chicken with rice.. I thought it will be not much....when it came holy cow...its huge... Needless to say I still have to eat the gyoza...I'm so full good thing they are open until 8:30 on a Sunday night.. Omg...I'm so full the service was awesome. The quality is great..."}
