{"text":"Thus far, my one beef with Toronto has been the apparent lack of really delicious ice cream shops (they have Hagen Daz and Ben&Jerry's in supermarkets, but not stores with their entire line of flavours).   That's why I was super happy to find this place! They have a wide variety of flavours and they all look delicious. My husband had the Lemon Sorbet and it was light and frothy and yummy. I had the coffee one with fudgy bits of chocolate (I forget the official name of the flavour) and it was, so far, the best ice cream I've had in the city.   Yum!"}
{"text":"Delicious homemade ice cream. I recommend the white chocolate ice cream. You can sample the flavours and then choose one that you like. The staff are patient, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"yummy yummy yummy in my tummy - despite all these fun ice cream trends shops, summer's consistently beats them all.   creamiest ice cream ever. try all the flavours (or however many until they get annoyed, which they rarely do because the employees sugary sweet there)"}
{"text":"Hazelnut is amazzzzing! Great service and friendly staff...still the best of the Yorkville gelato ice cream places!"}
{"text":"Summers is my absolute favourite ice cream parlour in Toronto. Everything is made fresh in the store with only the best ingredients. The staff is always so welcoming and lovely to chat with.  My favourite is the roasted hazelnut. Not many places do hazelnut flavoured ice cream and fewer do it well. I've never had one that even comes close to Summers.   Close second would be the Apple Cinnamon, which tastes like a heavenly apple pie. The lemon sorbet and pistachio are also great choices.  And always opt for the waffle cones. Probably the best I've ever had and the store radiates with the wonderful aroma all day long. They don't leak, and they're always tasty!"}
{"text":"Delicious -- worth every calorie!  My favourites are \"Toronto Pothole\" and Lemon sorbet.  Always a line-up but it's worth the short wait.  SERVICE - wonderful. The staff is friendly and they offer a sample if you're not sure what you want."}
{"text":"I tried the gelato and maybe I should've tried the ice cream. But I tried the two scoop mango and lemon gelato (which came out to $7.50, so yes a little pricey). The lemon was great but the mango was a failure with me being able to taste the icing sugar that went into making the gelato. Mango needs to have an overpowering taste in my opinion, however in this case I disliked being able to taste the sugar. The lemon was great though with a nice refreshing tangy taste to it, which was perfect for the hot day. May try again, but I'll have to try the ice cream (so I can compare against Greg's Ice cream on bloor/spadina)."}
{"text":"One of my favorite ice cream places in Toronto. I have come here for the past ten years and it lives up to its name - I have lots of sweet memories of having a Pecans and cream outside their store every summer :)"}
{"text":"Best ice cream in Toronto, if not all of Canada.  (not that i've been to every ice cream parlor in Canada, but I'd be willing to bet on Summers!)  Creamy, rich, delicious, decadent, (even the frozen yogurt!) superb ice creams.  There's a toffee butter brittle (forgot the name but it's the best ice cream ever) that's highly recommended.  I try a new flavor every time and I love them all (even liquorice!) The blueberry frozen yogurt tastes like a full-fat, fresh from the farm indulgence but with a small sprinkle of calories.  If you have a favourite flavour, Summer's will do it right and best.    This family-run shop is passionately obsessed with their ice creams, and they are good to the last lick!  This place is also a popular celebrity hangout when TIFF comes to town; there's pictures of various A-listers enjoying the Canadian creams.  :)"}
{"text":"Great ice cream, ok price.  Try the birthday cake ice cream. It's a goddamn birthday cake. In ice cream.  I haven't tried the frozen yogurt but I'm sure it's as good as the ice cream; this place is classy.  Ice cream."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite place for ice cream downtown. Gotta try the Strawberry Rhubarb or Strawberry Banana on one of their fresh and hot waffle cones."}
{"text":"Almond butter toffee. Nothing more to say. Amazing, high quality, creamy ice cream. Will be back."}
{"text":"This is a review for the STORE BOUGHT Summer's Ice Cream. I was so excited to see roasted marshmallow ice cream in my local grocery store, as I've had it at the shop. This is not homemade ice cream though. It has filler's and is made with artificial marshmallow flavour (I should have read the label!). So disappointed... It tastes decent, but it leaves a weird mouthfeel afterwards. Sigh..."}
{"text":"Two things:  1. Exceptional ice cream and service with a smile on a hot summer's day? = cool-but-average awesomeness.  However:  2. Gluten free ice cream cone for my Celiac daughter? = DAY-MAKING JOY AND HAPPINESS!  Small and packed, but friendly and fun. Well worth your patronage :-)"}
{"text":"With local flavours to choose from like Toronto Pothole and Credit River Turtle, Summer's will have you bursting with locavore love.   While the construction on Yorkville Avenue is purportedly slated to last until August, I hope that it won't deter people from visiting.  Tip: after you buy your ice-cream, make your way over to the big rock in the Yorkville Park. It's the best place to sit and enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Best ice cream place in TDot! I love their Pistachio & Chocolate Lover's Chocolate. The Taste & Service are very consistent in the 5 summers that I've been here. Even with all the new ice cream place such as Bang Bang, Sweet Jesus, Kekkou, etc. this place will always be a classic! This is not the place for insta-pics, just a good honest gelato. You might see celebs during TIFF here."}
{"text":"Really good ice cream but the guy working was extremely rude and uncomfortable. Makes me never want to come again and I'll make sure to spread the word. I get that your location is in yorkville but you don't have to act like you have something up your ***. I nicely asked for a couple of samples and was given attitude. When I finally placed my order he literally slammed the scoops of ice cream into cups and was rolling his eyes the entire time. I chuckled as I wasn't sure if it was a joke or not. Was I being set up on a reality TV show? That's how it felt. Anyhow, said thank you and have a good night regardless of the ignorant customer service and was replied to with \"yeah.\" Never again. There are other ice cream shops where I won't be treated like trash. If you charge $15 for two cups of ice-creams at least put a fake on your face and thank your customers."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for dodging Ferraris, Lamborghinis, and overdressed girls teetering on 5 inch stiletto heels, you too can enjoy homemade ice cream in Yorkville.  The ice cream was soft and creamy. They ran out of cheesecake flavored ice cream which saddened me. I felt really rushed which I don't like but the place was packed. Overall, it's a fun place to grab a scoop."}
{"text":"Great homemade ice cream with lots of flavours to choose from. My favourite is the \"Birthday Cake\" which is basically vanilla ice cream with a birthday cake mixed in (sprinkles and all!).  The staff are friendly and you can try a flavour before you decide. Their homemade waffle cones are to die for, but you can have your chosen ice cream in a cup if you prefer.  They also have homemade milkshakes which I have yet to try, although they sound delicious. Although there are lots of other ice cream/gelato places in the area, Summer's is the original and by far the best! It's a little on the expensive side but you do get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"Honestly!   Not sure what all the rave is about! Other than the fact that it's situated in the heart of Yorkville. It's Overpriced much like a lot of things in that area for the product you are getting, the flavours don't seem too out of the ordinary and are not spectacular tasting so much that it sets apart from other gelato and ice cream parlours in the same area.  Definitely paying for the rent in the prices.   Will likely not return back!"}
{"text":"Where has this ice cream parlour been all these years? As soon as you walk in, you can smell the amazing-ness. They have the traditional simple ice creams flavours (brownie points for having pistachio), as well as some creatively crafted ones. Everything is homemade and fresh; they don't believe in storing in freezers overnight. I ordered a scoop of the Toronto Pothole which has swirls of melted marshmallows with almonds and chocolate chunks. So good! Highly recommend this flavour.  Whenever you're up for a stroll through yorkville (who wouldn't), try this place! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious homemade ice cream! I don't understand why anyone would give this joint less than 5 stars.  On a hot summer day like today, I really enjoyed my banana cream and orange creamsicle scoops in a freshly made waffle cone. The flavours were perfect, not too overpowering or too sweet.  The staff is really sweet and hard at work.  There are benches outside for (limited) seating, but I suggest walking around or heading to Yorkville park to sit in the shade.  To the people complaining that it's overpriced: You're in Yorkville, not at your local Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"With this absolute heat wave in the middle of what's supposed to be fall, Ice cream is just the best solution to beat the heat, and Summer's is definitely the wise choice. This was recommended to me by other Toronto locals.  Straight away, I was told, \"you need to get the waffle cone cause it's amazing\", and boy was I not steered wrong. It's fresh and crispy, the perfect complement to your ice cream of choice. You can definitely get a couple of samples before making your decision and with that kind of selection, it's easy to see why! I've been told some of the stand out flavours include the Toronto Pothole (gravel not included), and the Campfire marshmallow. I went with good ol cookie dough, and I was not disappointed. Everything is homemade and you can really tell the difference. The cookie dough isn't like what you'd get in a tub of ice cream where it's in little chunks, but crumbles swirled into it. I can't wait to come back and try other flavours!  With it located on such a beautiful street, it's definitely the perfect place to grab a cone, and sit outside to just bask in the ambiance or people watch."}
{"text":"I am a totally icecream love. I have been to Summer many times. Handmade icecream, and comparing to other icream, thier's is very creamy.so many people line up during summer time."}
{"text":"Less than $5 for a ginormous single scoop in a regular, sugar or home made waffle cone! Get pisachio."}
{"text":"Good wholesome ice cream in a fresh waffle cone. Was walking around Yorkville and noticed how popular this spot was. Don't expect any novel flavours, they mainly have just the classics. You can try a sample or two if unsure of what you want.   The roasted hazelnut brought my back to Italy. Very rich in flavour and it has hazelnut pieces inside. SO liked the butter pecan which was also rich and flavourful. This ice cream melts rather quickly so eat it inside or in the shade.  Definitely go for the waffle cone which is made in-house...it's already included the price so why go for the sugar cone?"}
{"text":"So glad we found this on Yorkville Street tucked down some stairs just steps from Bloor and Bay Streets. Delicious homemade fresh flavors and open late!"}
{"text":"Not much needs to be said about this place.  Their ice cream is absolutely amazing!  That's it."}
{"text":"Delicious homemade ice cream! I got the espresso fudge mud pie (name? I can't remember) and the cookie dough on a chocolate and sprinkle dipped waffle cone. The espresso flavour was strong but I was forewarned on the descriptor. Slightly bitter, but still good. Both flavours had lots of decent sized chunks of fudge and cookie dough, respectively. Overall, very delicious. I will return to try more flavours for sure. I was slightly underwhelmed with my cone, it was a touch stale. But I also went late on a weeknight. There's also something to be said for the atmosphere. The staff was really great and the vibe of the store front as well as the surrounding Yorkville was perfect for a summer night and ice cream."}
{"text":"Craving something cool, sweet and soothing well you have hit the trifecta here folks. Located in the lower floor of nameless mini plaza this spot will provide a welcome relief on a hot day. There is the enticing smell of fresh waffle cones as you walk in. The proudly display that they make their own ice cream and it shows as these are not your run of the mill flavors. My friend recommended the Ontario Blueberry flavor and I added a Extreme Chocolate for good measure as I usually don't order chocolate ice cream as most places hold back on the chocolate. Not here folks not only there were chocolate chunks, there was chocolate swirled into the ice cream itself. The waffle cone is very good. Ontario blueberry tastes very natural so if you that flavor appeals to you by all means order (I didn't care for it much). High recommendation here for your ice cream fix."}
{"text":"I had the chocolate fudge icecream, it was delicious. I also tried their strawberry icecream; it was creamy and delicious. The waffle cones are fresh. The place is small, located in yorkville. I would take the icecream and walk around yorkville in the summer."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time and loved how it's such a cute & quaint space. There's a wall of celeb photos, an interesting set of flavours and a friendly staff. They also have real flowers in vases atop their tables which you can sit at inside"}
{"text":"Best strawberry ice cream ever! I enjoyed every bite and lick of that ice cream. I didn't want it to end lol. Till next time, I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Amazing. This ice cream is next level good.  Have had the chocolate peanut butter, white chocolate and a few others while my girlfriend who does not even like ice cream had the banana cream and loved it.  Will return here as much as possible and anybody who has not yet gone needs to make it a priority. With ice cream this good my comments regarding service, location, decor etc. are irrelevant."}
{"text":"You can try samples before decide.  Some of the staff were helpful and friendly while others can be indifferent. Personal favorites: irresistible almond toffee, rum raisin, simply butterscotch, burnt marshmallow Could be a 5 star if service is improved"}
{"text":"So many great flavours at this DT ice cream parlour. There's limited seating so it's definitely a grab and go kind of place but the chocolate and pistachio flavours are to die for! I also enjoyed the mint chocolate chip!   Stop by if you're in Yorkville! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing ice cream. Tons of flavours to choose from, and it's homemade. I had 2 scoops; pralines & cream and cookie dough. Taste was unreal. It's in a cute little village area just north of the university."}
{"text":"For myself, an avid ice cream lover, \"Summer's\" hits the spot everytime.  I went to get a milkshake, in my confusion of what flavour to get I tried the hazelnut ice cream which was absolutely delicious. The enthusiastic worker had recommended I do 2/3 of hazelnut and 1/3 chocolate in my milkshake. To her suggestion I tried it, and words are very hard to describe how good it was so I will simply say it was amazing, and you definitely need to go there."}
{"text":"Classic.  The best gelato in Toronto.  Very generous portions and at a competitive price.  A great part of the Yorkville post-dinner walk circuit."}
{"text":"Toronto Pot Hole was okay, but the next visit, I got the Campfire Marshmallow. ..delicious! It also has little toffee bits inside"}
{"text":"I tried the strawberry and Pistachio and dark chocolate. Strawberry was the greatest, it tastes like summer actually.  A bit expensive. Home made waffle. Nice Staff."}
{"text":"friendly staff.  can sample flavors. delicious.  gluten free cone available. toasted hazelnut is delicious. mango strawberry sorbet is one of their popular flavors."}
{"text":"Summer's ice cream is delicious, creamy and served on a fresh made waffle cone! All of the flavours are amazing but my favourite is the chocolate peanut butter. First time I went I ordered a second ice cream cone after I finished my first! It is a bit hidden, but the sweet smell from the street will lead you to this ice cream heaven!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my chocolate-chip cookie dough (my fave)  ice-cream cone here. It was super creamy and homemade with love. With a wide variety of flavours to choose from, there is something for everyone. Quite a few celebrities have frequented the parlour (see the wall of fame), so if you're into celebrity sightings, check it out during TIFF.   If you're not in the mood for a sweet treat, you can try their buttery popcorn. Service was just as sweet as the ice-cream. The only downside is that you have to shell out $4-$6 for a cone of ice-cream. That's Yorkville for ya!"}
{"text":"hidden gem! (Or maybe it really was just me that's never heard of this place before). This little shop makes its on ice cream in house, and let me tell you, some of the best quality ice cream I have had! I tried the chocolate peanut butter and chocolate brownie and loved every bite.  Warning: their smallest size portion is good enough to satisfy your sugar cravings!"}
{"text":"They've got the classics and some unique brand specific flavors which is always a nice treat. I went for the classic cookies and cream and I have to say that it wasn't any different than any other store. It wasn't any creamier than normal or the cookies weren't unique either. Perfectly good ice cream though that goes down the hatch silky smooth."}
{"text":"I haven't been here since high school and this was our dessert stop of the night after morcoco cholat was closed again for the second saturday in a row.   Although a long line up, it moves quickly. While in it, take a quick peek at what you want. The servic is efficient and very assembly line and logical which I like.   Oh yes, the ice cream. Homemade and I like it better than gelato. It's classic with cream in it. With the soft melty gelato texture. Perfect end to a hot summer evening.  If you get a cone, you don't have to pay extra for a waffle cone! I got the chocolate chip and I loved that it was FULL of little chocolate solids. yum."}
{"text":"Authentically made by none other than themselves. Personal favourite, strawberry.  Very rich and creamy, and extemely flavourful. Only drawback is that it is difficult to consume more than 2 scoops (perhaps you can do better as I don't have the tolerance in one sitting). I just have to compensate by multiple visits scattered not too far apart.  Lastly, the ice cream sold at the supermarket isn't of the same quality in texture. If you can, visit the store rather than saving a few bucks for the container version at the stores."}
{"text":"Very good, smooth ice cream! Tried their mint choco ice cream and it was very creamy and loaded with choco chips! Next time I would get the cone!"}
{"text":"Summer's has a good variety of flavours and they will let you try any flavour before committing to one. They make their ice cream fresh every day and the quality of the ice cream is amazing. I got a single scoop of the Birthday Cake flavour and it was fantastic. My friends got a scoop of coconut cream and cookie dough and they both enjoyed their ice cream very much. The staff is friendly and helpful and I will definitely return to try out more of their flavours."}
{"text":"Incredible homemade ice-cream served by happy friendly people."}
{"text":"Today's warm weather made me quite nostalgic of this place. Nothing feels quite as nice as walking around Yorkville in the summer time with a hefty scoop of pistachio ice cream. It really is my benchmark of a high quality ice cream scoop with their generous pieces of pistachios and waffle cone."}
{"text":"Best ice cream ever!!!! Pistachio & chocolate brownies amazing.  Ask for warm waffle cone"}
{"text":"Always enjoying picking up an ice cream here as I stroll around Yorkville.  Today I got the coconut cream and it was absolutely fantastic.  This was probably the best coconut flavoured ice cream I have ever had.  The cream and the coconut were just the perfect combination.  Their homemade ice cream and waffle cones are the best!!!"}
{"text":"They are very good, but expensive at $5 for a regular size with a sugar cone. The first time I went there was about three years ago, and as I came out with my cone, Sammy Hagar of Van Halen fame was directly in front of me going into the ice cream shop, so I kind of think of that every time I go there now. I had to check and he was in town promoting his brand of Tequila at the LCBO, so it was him.  Try the key lime pie yogart, it's so clean and tart and refreshing on a hot day, you could die.....and low cal, you'd never know it though."}
{"text":"such delicious icecream. had bailey's irish cream. i'll be back for more"}
{"text":"lord is this place expensive!  that being said, it's one of very few places in toronto that has soft serve ice cream. no, yogen fruz does not count. the fro yo at summer's isn't even good but it's better than nothing. and the regular ice cream is ok-- good selection of flavours. the homemade waffle cones are delicious. if they're making them when you order, ask if you can get one right off the iron.   the ice cream is not impressive and the prices are high, but if you want ice cream in toronto this is probably one of your best (/only) options  if you have the time, dolce gelato on college st is better, but you'll need to hop on the streetcar."}
{"text":"BEST ICE CREAM IN TORONTO. Yes, I'm even comparing this to bang bang. Their flavours are extremely rich and creamy. I went in for one scoop of ice cream and ended up leaving with 3 tubs of different flavours. It's also conveniently located in yorkville. I'm just a bit sad because I walk past the shop daily on my way to bay station and noticed that it is temporarily closed."}
{"text":"Went on the Victoria Day weekend; three cones over $14.00 a bit steep, but the ice cream was good- my wife loved the Rum and Raisin- my son the campfire and I had the Toronto. You can choose the waffle cone or the regular for no additional charge. The line up was almost out the door and the gentleman behind the counter couldn't help himself over-explaining his own rudeness in pushing himself on us while others were serving us concurrently. Take it easy fellas there is no rush here.. No Soup for You!!!"}
{"text":"Summer's in Yorkville took me back to another era. From the uniform of the counter-girl to the cute tables and chairs to the rich delicious ice cream, I felt like I was visiting an ice cream parlour from my childhood. Today was my first visit, so I was only able to try the espresso chocolate flavour and it was DELICIOUS. A one scoop cup is about $3.50 but it was a generous scoop and I certainly didn't need more. They had about 20 flavours, and maybe 6-8 different kinds of frozen yogurt/sorbets for the lighter choices. An array of different type of cones was also available. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place was great. The smell as you descend from the sidewalk is pure delightful waffle cone goodness; my cone was still warm from being so fresh off the press. Staff offered multiple samples before we made a decision and gave their opinion on personal favourites when asked. I love Ben & Jerry's Chunky Monkey so gave the Summer's Funky Monkey a try - a great twist with pineapple, coconut, walnuts and chocolate chips. A single scoop cone will run just under $5, not cheap but the right amount of sweet without overdoing it. I look forward to going back and trying some of the other flavours - a sample of dark chocolate orange might not be enough next time!"}
{"text":"The lady serving us was so sweet and informing. She knew every flavour, what would go best together and what tasted best on the ice cream sandwich (which is really great btw.) The hours are wrong, they are open even though it says they are closed. It was very clean and organized. The ice cream in general is really good and reasonably priced as well. I would recommend going here and will most definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Perks of working in downtown during the summer time is that it's close to a lot of food and dessert places.  Located in Yorkville Summer's Ice cream is serving up some awesome cool treats for those sweet tooths out there.  With in house made flavors, one of which I opted for, it's no wonder why its popular.  They've got a range of ice cream flavors and handful of yogurts as well.   Canadian Pothole: One of their iconic flavors, so it was only right to try this.  Was I happy I did.  Loads of chocolate, caramel and lovely goodness this was a decadent one.   They've got a great selection of flavors and some handful of yogurts to choose from.  Overall great place, I'll definitely be back before summer time ends!  Yum."}
{"text":"I was giving an out-of-town visitor a little tour of Toronto neighborhoods, and after a walk around Yorkville, we found ourselves in this delightful ice cream place.  We tried the mint & chocolate chip and expresso flavors in these guilt-free mini cups and sat down at one of their small roundtables to carefully savor every bite.  If you're in the area, you owe it to yourself to check this place out -- especially on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"Cookie cookie EXCELLENT VERY friendly and attentive staff. 30 years for a reason.... Yorkville is in transition, lots of construction and vacancies."}
{"text":"A very good place to hang out after you've done shopping on Bloor Street. I tried their Chocolate Fudge Brownie with their homamade cones, and taste good! They have lots of different flavour that you can try. The price is also ok, which is $5. The place is nice and clean, only a couple of seats. The other stores beside it, is kinda creepy, but it's fine."}
{"text":"Really good! Creamy and thick, almost sticky texture like turkish ice cream. Flavours dont rotate as fast as id like but theres so many to choose from. Good portion too"}
{"text":"Had coconut cream ice cream and it was so creamy and delicious. I'm impressed but my bf found it a little too sweet.   Their homemade waffle cone was good too!"}
{"text":"The ice cream and selection were excellent. But I found it to be way too expensive. My son got the ice cream sandwich and it was $6. I would say $4 is fair and they should have a kid size. Also, they don't heat the cookies. In California, a company called cream sells ice cream sandwiches for USD $3 and the cookies are warm.   I also found the man who served us, who appeared to be the owner, to be somewhat rude especially because we came with 4 kids.   -1 prices  -1 rude"}
{"text":"There are things I really enjoy in the summer. Summer's ice cream is one of my favourite place to visit every summer.   I visited summers ice cream at 10pm on Saturday night with family. I had such a great time there. I loved the ice cream there. Not overly sweet, and they offered free sample scoop of ice cream.   I got chocolate fudge brownie ice cream, hazelnut ice cream and pralines n creams.   What made out visit extra nice was the service. Nice lady gave us a corn of vanilla ice cream to baby. We insisted on paying but she said its her joy. It was just nice to be in friendly space with family.   Its soon bye bye to summer so go make some good memory there :)"}
{"text":"Cool Creamy Ice Cream on a summer day is the way to go! Walking around Yorkville, I always have to head over to Summer's. I've been enjoying this ice cream since I was a kid.   It's homemade and made with lots of love. It's creamy and not icy. It has so many different options including frozen yogurt. Also they made their waffle cones fresh.   I go for my favourite flavours - Cookie Cookie & White Chocolate. They have loads of crazy flavours including; Toronto Pothole, Simply Butterscotch and Almond Butter Toffee.   Also they have an amazing flavour; Apple Cinnamon - That has real apples and cinnamon.  Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"Neat shop. Best place in yorkville for ice cream. Great service. They have benches to enjoy the ice cream outside of their shop   4.25/5 *"}
{"text":"My favorite ice cream place! I'm not even from Toronto, I'm from Detroit and I will literally come back to Toronto just to eat the birthday cake ice cream. It's so creamy and delicious. While we were in Toronto for the weekend, we visited Summers Ice Cream twice. Lol it's so amazing that I had to make my ice cream waffle cone my wallpaper on my phone. Not even joking.  if you're near by or planning to make a trip to Toronto, make sure this place is in your list, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Fairly wide variety of flavour selections to choose from.  I got the Pistachio - it tasted pretty good and you can actually find the bits and pieces of pistachio! The only thing is, when there's a line up, you don't really get to look at all the flavours they offer and have to order right away (Yes - you can look at the menu board as well but most of us do prefer to look into the showcase, right? It's ice cream). Overall, a delicious ice cream store, nicely tucked in a beautiful neighbourhood. :)"}
{"text":"A cute little shop with lots of ice cream and frozen yogurt options. The price was a little steep for just a few scoops;  but the quality of the product and friendly staff more than make up for it."}
{"text":"They make their own ice cream.  Can't go wrong with that, right?  No only this, staff is awesome friendly.  Perfect place to go for ice cream on a nice summer stroll in Yorkville!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great for when you are walking around Yorkville. Awful for the waistline because I cannot resist.  Favourite Flavour - Toronto Pothole. There are other really good ones but I am stuck on this one for now."}
{"text":"Solid choice for ice cream in the yorkville. Good selection of flavours, and single scoop size includes the fresh made waffle cone!"}
{"text":"Completely OK ice cream, but many better options around....the move here is the waffle cone to make you forget how mediocre the stuff inside it is."}
{"text":"All of the ice cream is homemade! It's delicious & creamy. We ordered the chocolate lover's chocolate, chocolate peanut butter, and a cookie sandwich with chocolate chip cookies & chocolate fudge brownie ice cream. I got mine in a gluten free cone & I was so surprised & happy that they offered those! The staff were friendly & let us try the ice cream flavors before we bought something. The shop is located in a nice neighborhood & the store is very clean!"}
{"text":"Summer's is my go-to ice cream place during, well, summer. It's a tiny little place with 3-4 tables, so be prepared to stand. Waffle cones come with all scoops, so don't worry about stale sugar cones--they simply do not exist here :) Summer's always has a large selection of flavours, and the scoops are large! I wish I got the name of the employee who helped me, she was great in helping me pick my flavour."}
{"text":"Just popped in today and got one scoop, but the machine was down for no reason. A blonde girl served us first and when my friend's card didn't get through, she kept apologizing and said it was their machine's problem. After trying a few times but failed, she told the guy with curly black hair about it, and the guy blurted:\"it's her card\". So I tried it with mine but it didn't work either. And so did others. He kept us waiting for almost 25 mins, and my friend had finished the ice cream in the shop. He served with frowns and impatience, and seemed to be blaming the customers for the problem, while pressing the cash register aggressively. When I approached and ask him how long are we going to wait, another girl server with blonde hair told the guy:\"just let them have the free scoop\", yet the guy completely ignored her and refused to let us go and DID NOT APOLOGIZE WHATSOEVER. Poor manner and this is honestly the WROST customer service I have ever encountered. We are regulars but from now on I don't think that we are going to visit this place anymore if this guy is still working there. VERY DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"A bit hard to find for a tourist, but sure worth it.  Almond toffee's a winner...  great that they do catering!"}
{"text":"I love Summer's Ice Cream!  First of all, it's in Yorkville, so you can walk around with your ice cream enjoying the beautiful and bougie scenery. The inside is pleasant and clean, but I think only has 3 tables.  Second, the flavours are SO good, especially the Apple Cinnamon, Chocolate Lover's Chocolate, and Raspberry Cream. All flavours are creamy and homemade.   Third, the service. Every time I have been here, there has been a friendly staff member offering recommendations, samples, and initiating general chitchat. You get the feeling that they are genuine people who just love spreading joy through ice cream, haha!"}
{"text":"I cannot live without it in the summer. The quality is as good as Ed's, it just that I live closer to Summer's. I am there often in the summer and my favorites are:  1- Espresso fudge mud pie 2- Birthday cake 3- Any sorbet  Regardless of what you get, REMEMBER the WAFFLE CONE!!!!  I shed a tear every time when fall comes, and I can feel that it will be the last Summer's ice cream before May-ish next year."}

{"text":"Summer's sweet memories is a cute-looking ice cream parlour that carries a certain amount of fame around it, as demonstrated by the wall covered in photos of celebrities who have been there. They also carry merchandise such as drawings of ice cream flavours and iPhone cases, although I won't be buying them because I'm not coming back.  The cashier himself was rather aloof and drifted between the kitchen and cash register periodically. We were the only customers there at the time, so the unwelcoming atmosphere was particularly strong. However, when another customer arrived, he brightened up significantly and was a lot warmer compared to how he treated my friend and I. Very concerning, but I chose not to dwell on it.  Summer's contains classic ice cream flavours with thick and creamy textures, kind of like Breyers Double-Churned ice cream. The ice cream I sampled were all way too sweet, and when I purchased my Lemon Meringue ice cream I regretted it immediately. The ice cream was almost like marshmallow fluff, and twice as disgusting. The artificial lemon taste permeated my mouth, and I could not finish my single-scoop. My friend's apple cinnamon tasted much better- it resembled Starbuck's Caramel Apple Spice. Of course it was also incredibly sweet.   This is another store where their reputation is misleading. I'll go somewhere else for my ice cream needs, thanks."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place. Fresh homemade ice-cream,...hey, they even make their own cones!!! Seriously, what's not to love about this place. Their flavors are amazing, service is fast and quick (when there's a line, it moves pretty quickly).   Unbeatable people and pet watching in Yorkville :)  Some flavors I'd recommend- the hazelnut, (with flecks of hazelnut mixed in), pistachio, strawberry and cream, lemon sorbet, and the key lime pie aka the 'healthy choice' at only a 120 calories per scoop."}
{"text":"Homemade ice cream and the toughest ice cream critic I know (my toddler) approves. And they have the best ice cream sandwiches!"}
{"text":"It's great ice cream place, I love the options and flavours. This place usually is pretty busy, especially in summers. I love their Hazelnut, Peanut Butter, and Chocolate Fudge ice cream - they all taste amazing. My only concern is price (even still, 1 scoop $5 but still, generous enough) and service. It can be very slow, and particular girl working there always look angry."}
{"text":"Hands down the best ice cream I've had in ages. In the heart of Yorkville, but don't let that fool you. Completely unpretentious, a little ma and pop looking shop with amazing handmade ice cream and waffle cones. Best part is the frozen yogourt that tastes just as flavourful as the ice cream but is low fat, and advertises the calorie count. My favourite is the Key Lime Pie @ 120 calories and 3 grams of fat - and tastes as good, if not better, than a real slice of key lime pie.   Lines can get busy in the summer but moves fast and gives you time to check out the wide array of flavours. For a foodie, it's the perfect mix of traditional and unique flavours. Also serves soft serve low fat ice cream, which will be my try on my next visit."}
{"text":"Always friendly service! The scoops are quite large, I'm not a fan of the flavours. I've gotten birthday cake and rum and they tasted stale ... It says they're made in house but it didn't taste fresh."}
{"text":"If you're ever walking around yorkville on a hot day, be on the lookout for this tasty little ice cream shop. It's hidden on the lower ground level of shops along yorkville ave, which is sometimes hard to spot. The ice cream is delicious. They have tons of unique flavours to choose from. If you're feeling adventurous you can even try putting the ice cream between two soft cookies to make a sandwich. Would definitely recommend. Yorkville's best ice cream."}
{"text":"If you have a sweet tooth, an active imagination, and a bit more cash on hand, this is definitely the place for you  I'll admit I was sticker shocked when I first came to Summer's Sweet Memories, but once I got my serving of coconut cream and peanut butter chocolate I was completely sold on this amazing creamery. Fresh and bold flavors, friendly and super patient staff (when you have indecisive friends), not to mention ample seating for a place this size.  I'm definitely coming back when I'm in the Yorkville area looking for something sweet."}
{"text":"AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING ICE CREAM! Was visiting from Detroit and we stumbled upon summers ice cream. Best decision of our whole trip. It was so good that we ended up having it TWICE lol. The ice cream was just so creamy and so good. This place is a must try. Maybe a little bit on the pricey side still worth every single penny."}
{"text":"The creamiest ice cream I have ever had in the city. My first time I ordered the rum raisin and it was good. I will definitely go back and try the other flavours. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Went to Summer's with my wife. Staff was helpful in helping me sample two flavours - mint chip and pistachio. Both tasted great.  I went with a scoop of pistachio and was very happy with it - smooth texture and good flavour. My wife enjoyed her soft serve twist.  Restaurant was very clean. Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"Cool off after dinner at one of Yorkville's fine eatery and get some ice cream from Summer's. In a three block radius, this place is the only ice cream specialists crammed amongst the gelato and cheesecake restos.  This place is a popular go-to-place especially when the area changes into from a wine and dine hot spots into local eatery dance clubs and private VIP joints.   Always a line up but you don't wait long. They also sell yogurt and ice cream and make freshly squeezed drinks like lemonade. $"}
{"text":"just OK. staff MUST be more nice, wellcoming and smiling should be included in the price! large choice of flavour, but lots of crappy ones also! price are soso."}
{"text":"Summer's Ice Cream is a staple among dessert stops in the downtown core. Tucked away on Yorkville Ave. west of Bay St., you might not even notice it if you blink. They're located in the lower level of a building, making them one of the city's better kept secrets. Not so secret, I suppose, as they've got a collection of photos on the wall from celebrity visitors.  It's an elegantly designed space with adequate space for those queuing in line. The displays and decor all work well together. I must've come on the day where the lone staff member had an uneventful day, as he didn't seem enthused to be selling ice cream. However, I've been here in the past and received friendly service, so I won't hold it against them.  As far as the ice cream goes, it's very good.  From a flavour and texture perspective, I'd say it's some of the best I've had in a while. Waffle cones are a must for me every time I visit. Price is also a huge plus here, with a single scoop and waffle cone costing just $4.95, taxes included. At that price, you really can't complain too much."}
{"text":"Simply some of the best ice cream I've ever had. My favourite is the birthday cake. I always order this and it's like a party in your mouth. They use real cake and sprinkles, omg, worth the $6 cone. They've also started something new: waffle cones and chocolate dipped waffle cones. Pro-tip: Check out the celebrity board while you're here, it's fun to read."}
{"text":"Very unique flavors. I tried the chocolate orange ice cream - very creamy, great flavor. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Friendly service and delicious ice cream!  I was overwhelmed by all the flavours and decided to be boring and go for plain chocolate.  I didnt regret it at all because it was the best chocolate ice cream i've ever had.  So creamy and full of flavour.  Worth every penny!  I want to go back and try all the other flavours now!"}
{"text":"We were looking for some ice cream/gelato in Yorkville to finished our night of drinking and eating with some desserts.....   Gelato up the street was charging $5 for a tiny cup. I know this is Yorkville, the playground of the \"Rich and Famous\" . Then I walked into Summer's Sweet Memories and find out their homemade ice cream is reasonably priced for $3.50 and served in a homemade waffle cone...This is my kind of place!!   The staffs here are nice and friendly... and I got some samples until I settle on Pistachio. It was really good, rich and creamy and with tons of real nuts inside. A little on the sweet side..but it is call Summer's Sweet Memories!!   Open passed midnight this Saturday night!   Summer's Sweet Memories is most unpretentious place in the Yorkville area!!"}
{"text":"I love their waffle cones! Crispy and freshly baked! I'm not a fan of sweets but I love their selection, not too sweet for my taste. Pistachio and butter pecan are my favorites."}
{"text":"Extra ordinary ice cream! I'm a sweet addict or lover or whatever you wanna call it. I go out during summer in search for the nearest ice cream parlor near me. I love that summer's ice cream is now just walking distance!!! They have different cones just like other ice cream parlor, but their ice cream is something very unique. The taste is delicate and the texture is smooth.  I love pistachio flavour and I always look for it in every dessert possible. So, ofcourse in ice cream that would be my instant choice. Their pistachio ice cream is one of the best i've tasted so far. The bits and pieces blends perfectly with the cream!!  I will be a REGULAR here!!"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY??  Their homemade ice cream! They've been serving ice cream in yorkville since 1985. A truly Canadian shop for more than 35 years!   Their ice cream comes in soooo many different flavors and it's all made fresh daily. Their sorbets and yogurts also taste really good!  I had their campfire marshmallow since I've never tried the marshmallow flavor and it actually is a flavor that requires more technical skills as I've been told by someone who makes ice cream a lot.   I like the ice cream is served in a cone because their cones also taste really crisp and fresh as well.   I think I will try the sorbets next time because their sorbets are so refreshing!  LAST TIP?  don't be scared to test out their flavors first before committing to buying a cone. You can opt for one or two scoops and you can mix and match if you want two scoops. Sit outside by the bench and do some people and car watching as you enjoy your ice cream! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"PROS: -Summer's Ice Cream is EXTREMELY SMOOTH -wide variety of CLASSIC FLAVOURS -scoop sizes are great for the price  TIP#1: No extra cost for their in-house made waffle cone (it's got a nice sweet pastry taste and very crunchy). TIP#2: You can sample the flavours first!  CONS: -not very unique flavour combinations -I personally found a lot of their flavours too sweet  I got their Butter Pecan which tasted good and had a decent amount of pecan chunks throughout. Nothing spectacular, so I most likely won't be back ~"}
{"text":"Well yes. 4.5? More cause I need to try the rest of the flavors haha. Pretty darned good. As others have said, creamy ice cream. And my fav is the coffee which tasted very much like coffee which is great.  Even the sorbet is thick and not watery or icey. Lots of flavor.  I will be back to try more! I like that they said they made their own sugar cones, though did not see that. ---- Tasted the pistachio again when I went again on the weekend. Yummy.  I did have a chance to sample other flavors. Some they do amazingly well and others not so much. The great flavors I had so far are the turkish coffee - very strong coffee flavor and the mango raspberry sorbet which is flavorful and thicker and creamier than any sorbet.  The lemon meringue wasnt as lemony as I would like but the chocolate brownie was great and pistachio like I mentioned.  - one thing is consistent - the smallish kinda scoop you get. you will notice it more if you get it in a tub than a cone. Whether you get one scoop or two. ------------- EDIT Well this review is based on their in store tubs you can buy in most grocery stores. I got the coffee again and this time it seemed quite frozen-whip-creamy. So it is creamy but not in a full of flavor kinda way. I guess it is different when you go there and when you have it at home along side my favorite coffee haagen das to compare. so I moved the review rating to a 3..."}
{"text":"Really great ice cream- I ordered the Bailey's flavour. It's not as good as Bang Bang Icecream but the line here moves fairly fast."}
{"text":"I felt out of place in Yorkville, for some reason I had an sudden urge to sip cosmos and talk to my girlfriends about my posh summer home. Hmmm....  Good thing this place is all about the ice cream and nothing more.   Overall thoughts: Good ice cream. The smell of their waffle cones are very enticing. Prices are reasonable. And the fact that Iron Man has visited before (as proven by a photo clipping) is a plus. ;)"}
{"text":"Unbelievably good ice cream, made fresh on site, waffle cones made fresh, even gluten free waffle cones available.   Great staff, great sundaes, so good I almost cried. Best ice cream I've ever had by a mile."}
{"text":"Strolling through the Yorkville area on a too hot day in desperate need of a cool me down I stumbled upon a group on youngsters munching on ice cream cones. I followed the crowd of icecream laden youngsters down the stairs to heaven sent Summer's Sweet Memories.  A glass case of homemade ice creams awaited me. Two flavours jumped out at me as I browsed the tubs of flavours: Chocolate Peanut butter  and Espresso Mud Pie. The server behind the case suggest I sample them, without hesitation I agreed.   Both flavours delicious Chocolate Peanut butter: a creamy milk chocolate icecream with ribbons of smooth peanutbutter woven through out. Espresso Mud Pie: a rich robust coffee flavoured ice cream with chocolate slivers and something crunchy....i think it was toffee pieces.  I settled for the Espresso Mud Pie because it packed the punch in flavours and contrast in textures I love in ice cream.  Overall A really cute little ice cream parlor in the heart of Yorkville with great service and pop corn machine selling fresh made pop corn as well!!"}
