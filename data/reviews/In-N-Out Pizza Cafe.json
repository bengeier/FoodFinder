{"text":"We are originally from NYC, and our pizza standards are high. We ordered large Pepperoni pizza and it was outstanding. The sauce was not sugary sweet like most pizza places around here.  It arrived hot and tasted amazing. The boneless wings were hot and delicious. We are definitely going to be ordering again!"}
{"text":"We ordered for the second time, and everything was just as delicious as the first time.  We had the Greek Pie, Turkey Hoagie, and a small regular pizza with black olives & mushrooms.  The hoagie was AMAZING"}
{"text":"I just came here for the first time and the service is great. I really enjoyed the pizza. I would highly recommend dropping in for a pleasant customer expirience. Be warned portions are large in a good way! 

I will be back for sure, maybe I'll order s whole pie and ask for light cheese as I prefer my pizza a little lighter than this."}
{"text":"This place has very good pizza. We got a white pizza with ham and onions and a traditional pizza with pepperoni and sausage. Crust was light, crisp and moderately thin. Generous amount of cheese and toppings. Not to heavy on the sauce. Overall, very flavorful and would recommend to anyone looking to try out a new pizza place."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery via gh from these guys tonight. I got an Italian hoagie and Oreo cheesecake. The delivery was timely and 10 minutes early. The food was very good. The bread, veggies and meat were all excellent and there was lots of dressing without drowning it. It was a big sandwich, covered in onions and tomatoes. If not an onion fan, I'd ask them to cut them back. The Oreo cheesecake was sublime and reasonably priced. I'm only stopping here to lick the container."}
{"text":"We accidentally gave the wrong phone number for our order and didn't hear the delivery guy when he knocked. He tried to call but the number was wrong :) they were super accommdating when we followed up on our order and they made a special trip back out to deliver it. Thank you! Great pizza, too!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Robinson township! Great, friendly service, fast delivery 
I definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"The great food at affordable prices. The owner is also a super nice guy and makes the food in what seems to be 10 minutes or less. 5/5 recommend."}
{"text":"Pizza was good! Ample toppings. Tasted like their crust had a butter garlic seasoning in it too. Overall, good. Also ordered the buffalo chicken salad.  I can't help to compare it against Juliano's since I love their salad and it is right next door to in in out. Dressing is not homemade. No fries on salad. Juliano's definitely has a better salad. However, pizza was good! Support small business and give this place a try."}
