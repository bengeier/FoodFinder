{"text":"I'm from San Diego, where we take taco shops serious like New Yorkers take pizza serious. After 12 days in the Phoenix metro area and maybe 5 different Mexican joints, I finally found a taco shop that made the cut. (Always trust a place that ends in \"berto's\")
 I ordered the staple of SoCal Mexican food, the Carne Asada Burrito. This burrito is perfect, the meat is a good cut and properly seasoned, the pico and guac don't overpower the other flavors,  and the tortilla has great flavor and texture. Along with a Jamaica that wasn't watered down like some of the other places, this was a great meal.
 I'm in town for a few more days, and I will definitely be back here to try some more menu items."}
{"text":"Awesome fast Mexican food. Highly recommend. Had the Menudo. Delicious. The food was hot and tasty, with all the sides, limes, hot sauce, onion and cilantro."}
{"text":"I ordered three beef tacos which were over $3 a piece, and ALL of the meat was rock hard and dry, I was SO pissed!!! $10 worth of nothing edible"}
{"text":"Muy buenos los tacos y los Hot diga al 100 la atención muy buena recomendado l 100 todas  los dis comida fescas recién hecha"}
{"text":"I would rather drive two streets to have this over filbertos!!! They are genuinely nice and the food is super authentic! Super happy this place is here!"}
{"text":"Quick and efficient for a burrito.  Had a bean and cheese with potatoes and guacamole.  Would not bother with the overpriced juice next time though."}
{"text":"Permanently closed. Phone number has been disconnected. Used to have really good food. I hope they can recover and come back."}
{"text":"As a Mexican born and raised in California I'm sorry this place was horrible!! The chili had a strange taste !! We just threw it away! And bought hamburgers from B K and that says a lot!! Don't waste your time!!! 
It could have been an off day for them!! 
Anyways as we ordered through the Drive thru I was practically yelling thinking Omgosh really!! 
Never again!! 

If you try it let me know if you like it ok lol"}
{"text":"Stopped by this morning because we had a craving for some Mexican breakfast burritos. Deflated balloons were surrounding the perimeter of the building and also blocking the sign that directed guests to the drive thru. We drove around back, found the drive thru and placed our order. \"Cash only\". Ok, sketchy but whatever, we're hungry. 
Customer service was friendly enough. However, it took 20 minutes total to get TWO burritos which totaled $17. A little communication from the employees would have gone a long way in easing our frustration from waiting for such a long time. We finally got our food, got home and we were excited to dive in but.... our order was wrong. Ugh... 
The quality of the food was great but after waiting 20 minutes in a drive thru and being frustrated when we got home, I doubt we would consider returning to this location."}
{"text":"My husband loves this place. I'm not a major fan but the #18 is great lol that the only thing I get. They do make the door fresh to order! since it's 24/7 makes good a good late night treat after a few drinks."}
{"text":"My sister and I sometimes have late night Mexican Food cravings. I never been Yolibertos but it was closer than other late open Mexican restaurant. HOw I regretted going here. I should have driven the extra miles to go to Rolibertos. The burrito was unpleasurable to eat. The tortilla was hard, from frozen and not fully cooked, and greasy. The filling was tasteless The enchilada sauce was salty and I had to throw it out completely. The rice and beans were okay. The hot sauces were bland,"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and each time I got the chilequiles with red sauce. And every time was delicious. I love that the red chile sauce is hot and I don't have to add salsa"}
{"text":"Every trip we have made here, has been absolutely wonderful. The food tastes just made, the service is awesome!"}
{"text":"This is our second time coming. Last night we ordered a bunch of food they got our order completely correct except for we asked for no lettuce on our enchiladas. The guy was so good at checking our food that he noticed it before us and said oh I'm sorry we forgot to put no lettuce on here we'll remake that for you. I actually didn't think it was that big of a deal so I said no don't worry about it and he goes no, I want to do it correct so they not only remade the enchiladas but also let us keep the ones with lettuce on them!!! Super apologetic didn't need to be the food was good anyways they have multiple different types of salsa they have carrots and jalapenos lemons radishes the works! I love this place I will drive past Filibertos,  Los Favoritos any other taco shop to get here I don't care that it's five miles away from my house!! 
They also have 5 mini tacos any meat you want for $5.99 they also have a jr bean and cheese burrito for $1.99, as well as many other specials daily and throughout the week! Let me just say there Pollo asada for the mini tacos is bomb.com!!!"}
{"text":"I was quite surprised as the chorizo breakfast burrito I ordered was better than expected, it was delicious. It was warm, had the right amount of spice and blended well with the cheese and beans I added. It was a little greaser than I'm used to for a chorizo burrito but I managed. This restaurant's drive through is open 24/7 and it's on a major intersection in Chandler so it's convenient for me. The menu is diverse and they sell dishes typical fast food Mexican restaurants don't such as chilaquiles and sopes."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Always rude. They messed up my order in the drive thriugh. When I got home and realized, I called to let them know. The guy who answered said he didnt speak english and hung up on me. Will never go back."}
{"text":"This place was delicious  just stopped by because my bf and I noticed it was knew.. they have a bunch of different salsas to choose from. 
It was very tasty!"}
{"text":"Employees were to busy chatting with each other. One employee had his head out the  drive thru window talking to people the entire time I was there. The cook come from outside and made my food. Did he was hands before making my food???"}
{"text":"I will go there over filibertos any day great customer service the dining area is open 24 hours the customer service is great the cashier is even patient with you after a night of drinking they also realized that they messed up on my order before it got to me and made me another with no fuss and offer me the messed up order for free. And did I mention the food was delicious... #my new spot"}
