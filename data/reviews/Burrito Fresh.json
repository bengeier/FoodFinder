{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. The first time was out of curiosity, the remaining times, out of convenience.

The steak burritos are far from outstanding, but as long as you know what to put on it (and what to avoid) they're not bad, and will fill you up for a reasonable price. I would suggest avoiding the lettuce (more on this later) and green peppers. The green peppers were distracting and made eating it difficult and messy.

My main gripe with this place is by default, they both put lettuce in your burrito and put it in a panini press. On their own, either is fine, but together they result in a burrito full of droopy, wilted lettuce. Not appetizing.

As others have said, the guacamole is not free, but the student discount takes care of most of that, if you're able to take advantage.

I'd probably continue to eat there if I was already in the area, but I would never go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"I actually have been to this place a handful of times, and I personally think it is much better than big fat burrito, which is closer to the other side of the U of T campus. I order the bean burrito (not the soy meat) and I have personally always been happy. The ingredients are fresh enough and the guacamole is quite good though not free like the other reviewer mentions. I have noticed this place is generally empty, the most full I have see it is with 3 other booth occupied. I rec it if you are on bloor st, or at the U of T campus looking for a burrito fix. I have recommended to a few others, and I have not heard any complaints. They do grill the burritos for those that are wondering. I don't know how their quality has been of late though, as I have been doing Chipotle runs for a few months now!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when this place opened in my first semester of grad school.  And then I tried it.  And it was bad.  Bad.

Toronto is a void for good mexican food, so it's not like the place had strong competition (this was also the pre-Chipotle days, and while I would never eat Chipotle in California, it's the best Toronto has).  Still, it was perhaps the worst Mexican food I had in the city.  The rice was cooked with canned veggies, the salsa might as well have come out of a can (it probably did), and none of the flavors in a simple veggie burrito meshed well.  On top of that, it was pricey for what you got.

For a place called Burrito Fresh, it's really not that fresh.  Or good."}
{"text":"While walking through The Annex I saw a sign for this place and thought I would add another burrito place to my list.  Unfortunately this one will not be making that list.

The restaurant is located on the second level and is quite large from what you would expect from its street-front visibility.  I was there around noon on a hot and sunny day and the place was dead, there was just one other group sitting out on their patio.  

Based on their name you would expect that the ingredients would be fresh, but by their taste, they were not.  The prices are high for the quality that you get ($7.25 for a burrito + $0.99 for guac), but if you're a student you can get a 10% discount if you show your ID.

I'd skip this place if I were you."}
{"text":"I will forever be on the search for a stellar burrito in Toronto but I actually really like Burrito Fresh. I used to live around the corner and go there a lot and for what it is, it's pretty good! 

They offer burritos, quesadillas, and fajitas with options of grilled vegetables, chicken, steak, pork and I think maybe some sort of tofu-type thing. Sometimes I order the \"burrito in a bowl\" which is just a little more of everything without the tortilla. 

Like others have said, the guac is extra but it's not bad and their \"burrito sauce\" (chipotle and lime) and pico de gallo is pretty damn tasty! I particularly like their decor, it's pretty cheesy but fun. Colourful with upbeat music and a cool patio that is always empty. On the stretch of Bloor that this is located, I would say it's one of the better options rather than McD's, or Over Easy or Booster Juice. Also, bring your student card and get 15% off!"}
