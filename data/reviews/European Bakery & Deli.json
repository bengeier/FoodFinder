{"text":"Great bread, tasty baked goods, plus a nice selection of assorted European grocery items and candy. My closest location for real Habiro gummy bears! They also carry a brand of herbal teas that I have been buying for decades but cannot find in many grocery stores. Plus very friendly and attentive service. What more can you ask for?   You know what? They'd still be great even if they ONLY had that amazing bread. YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Holy BLEEP finally chevap that's the real deal. Just as good as I had during my Balkan travels. I will be back for your burek and homemade kajmak!!"}
{"text":"I've walked past this place many times and i'm glad I finally tried it! The ladys who work there are very nice and helpful. Their bureks are so delicious and so cheap!  I've only tried two so far and the meat one is my favourite. Their cakes are also delicious and also very fairly priced."}
{"text":"Very good food, both packaged and fresh. Deli selection limited, but good. Excellent value. They make a pretty good croissant. I still haven't tried the bread but it looks and smells good!"}
{"text":"Great small bakery. Bread is always fresh and we come here for Burek and Sirnica! The only thing that sucks is our family has moved to the NW and we dont come here on a regular basis anymore but whenever I find myself in the nearby vicinity I make it"}
{"text":"Love love love this bread. Support local, friends! This is some of the best bread in the city!!! Yum yum yummmo! My fav is the onion rye! Every time. Toasted with Dijon"}
{"text":"I had never eaten Albanian food. This turned out to be a great place. The staff was very courteous and they explained with delight what each dish was. We really enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Found this 5-star place on Yelp while driving south from Edmonton. I agree with the other ratings wholeheartedly!  Their food is simple Albanian but excellent. And the people are lovely, warm and considerate. Would definitely eat here weekly if I lived in Calgary.   Their turkey sandwich, meat burek and desserts all impressed us.   The parking isn't easy to find, as you have to enter a block south."}
{"text":"Damn... this place is amazing with all its hidden treasures. The ready made burek meat pie is out of this world, as long as you're not on a diet. There are frozen foods to bake at home that are equally as delicious, and their selection of unique desserts is outstanding. I've tried a few and could not be pressed to pick my favorite one, as they're all so different and soooo good. Finally, their bread and bread-type products remind me of something that you would pick up in the morning in a European bakery and stuff awesome deli meat and cheese into."}
{"text":"Love this place! can not recommend it enough. Reasonably priced and delicious, not to mention the great atmosphere and customer service. From the moment you walk in you are treated like a family member :)"}
{"text":"Simple, DELICIOUS, no fuss bakery. The service is always impeccable, the Burek's and bread are amazing, and the price is always right.   When I stumbled upon this place it made my day, and I have continued to go back weekly for my freshly baked loaf. They also have a cabinet of amazing looking \"breakup desserts\", that would surely cure any broken heart just by looking at them.   Take the extra 18 steps off of the 17th Avenue sidewalk to venture here, I am sure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I frequent this place a couple times a month-love the cheese burek here- delicious! Service is always friendly and fast. The only downfall is the parking situation- not many spaces."}
{"text":"A tiny bakery with a nice family feel. The owner is a very sweet lady. I go here for great quality bread which costs less than what I pay in the supermarket for homemade bread with natural ingredients. She will even slice your loaf for you. I wish they sold whole wheat pizza dough. I have looked everywhere in Calgary for whole wheat pizza dough and I'm yet to find any, if anyone knows where to get some please message me!"}
{"text":"I visited many times, I like the cheese  burek, meat burek and Spanish burek. I prefer to eat in the bakery because I cannot resist the taste when the burek is freshly baked. Actually, it's a nice place with friendly staff. I recommend it and give yourself a chance to try delicious food."}
{"text":"I was introduced to the Burek from here by a coworker and had added it to thinks to check out on 17th when I'm down there.  Sadly I forgot until I was trying to escape the heat and crowds of the year's lilac festival.    This little places has a poor street presence and signage so I would have missed it if I'd never heard of it and wasn't on foot.   It feels like you have to go into a condo complex to get at it almost (weird).  Inside I was struck by how much Burek they gave me for a fairly low cost (I forget to be honest) At first I wasn't sure I could eat a 1/4 of the pie they handed me but after tasting it again I made short work of it.  I've only tried the cottage cheese and feta but it's to die for.   I'd love to try out some more of their offerings next trip.  I'm very glad the lilac fest vendors had huge lines and I ended up finding this place's location as I will make an effort to return again."}
{"text":"One word, burek (specifically, sirnica if you are familiar with Bosnian dishes).  Burek, or sirnica, is a filled pastry usually containing beef, cottage cheese, or spinach and cheese.  Some variations contain all of the above, some only one, and some have other ingredients.  European Bakery & Deli has the cottage cheese & feta variety.  Of course, that's not all they have.  They are also a bakery, and sell all kinds of delicious and freshly prepared deserts and breads.  In addition to this, they have a limited selection of European foods, chocolates, and drinks.  Generally a well rounded small European bakery.  But they really excel with the sirnica.  They serve it from a pizza warmer that you'll find at any pizzeria.  But make no mistake, it's not pizza.  It's one of the best European dishes I've ever had and they prepare it really well here.  You can also follow it up with one of their deserts, all of which taste delicious.  Stop by the next time you're on 17th!"}
{"text":"Here from Dallas Texas looking for something different and we found it. The service was great and the food was better. We both got the Burek and it was delicious. We also tried the apple strudel and a cream horn  found them both to be very good. I wish we had room in our luggage for some bread as it all looked and smelled great. On our next trip here we will return for sure."}
{"text":"This bakery is small, has parking but has amazing prices for bread and for pastries.  The portions are huge here and you aren't paying more than $3 or $4 for any of amazing assortments; lemon poppy seed, cr√®me horns,  hazelnut pound, apple strudel, apple cheesecake , lemon coconut, baklava triangle, strawberry mouse, apple cheesecake, and rum ball.  For loaves of bread, there is onion rye, whole wheat, pumpernickel, light rye, arctic bread, French bread, sourdough, organic bread, and baguettes amongst many others.  You have competition though; there was a huge line up when I was there, so thank god they have free parking outside."}
{"text":"I really love this bakery! Service is always friendly! This is where I get my breads since it's near my home and always fresh.   They also have tasty pastries and tiny cakes. So delicious!   I recommend it to anyone looking for fresh breads! Many assortments. I usually have the sour dough or whole grain.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday afternoon at 3pm for a snack. Ordered a slice of meat burek. There's also 3 other flavours to choose from. The bread was a light flaky croissant crust with a pillowy bread interior. The meat was flavourful and the boys devoured it. A slice is $5. Which is cut into 2 pieces so perfect for sharing. I also had a half order of the sausages in a bun called chevap. The meat is very tender but not heavily spiced. The mini sausages and the hot, soft bread were yummy!  It's a nice change from meat skewers in pita bread. I'd definitely return for either item and perhaps try some jams or spreads.   I'm not close to this area and we made a special trip to visit this shop. So glad we did! The owners are from Albania and the lady who served us was very helpful. They also sell Romanian groceries and other items from that region. The store also had an assortment of breads from eye, sourdough, pretzels, cheese bites etc. Way to go!!!  Do note they have limited parking spots as they're on 17 Ave and limited seating. It's basically a counter. Sorry no pics fellow Yelpers! We ate the food hot and I couldn't get the boys to stop for a pic."}
{"text":"we love to stop by when we are in calgary. great cevap and breads and burek"}
{"text":"I often stop by for their $5 student special deal that includes the Burek and pop. The staff is incredibly friendly and nice. One time I didn't have enough change and they were okay with it! The lady was so sweet and understanding towards broke high school students. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"i love this place!   took my coworkers here to introduce them to their first Burek, and it was a hit! such a cute little deli, and the lady working in the front is so sweet! she saw that my friends had never tried Burek before, so she cut up a few little pieces for them to try! so nice!  We got a potato one, and a spinach & cheese one, and they were both so delicous! the potato one tastes like a giant perogy.  I've also had fresh bread & buns from there, and i've always been impressed.  I have a weird condiment obsession, and this place never fails to have some sort of mustard or pickled stuff that i've never tried, as well as tons of different European candies and sweets!   definitely a hidden gem on 17th Ave SW!"}
