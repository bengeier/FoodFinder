{"text":"First visit here and I don't know how this restaurant slipped by me. Five stars across the board! Food, service and setting were excellent! Take the short trip down 51 to McFarland for an enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"Came here with a large group and had a great time. Had the chicken chimi with rice and beans and it was very good. Service was excellent, very responsive and a great sense of humor. You guys have a winner in McFarland."}
{"text":"Every positive comment is 100% correct love the chips and salsa and we had the chimechanga, it was excellent! Definitely will be a return customer."}
{"text":"Thank you, thank you Palenque for coming to McFarland.  Our little suburb has been with out a decent Mexican restaurant since...well, since forever. The complimentary chips and salsa have a wonderful, homemade flavor and are a great way to start your meal.  Speaking of starting your meal, the margaritas are a pretty yummy compliment to the food; not overly sweet, with the right amount of tequila.  The menu is extensive and I am thrilled with the large selection of vegetarian dishes. The first time we went to Palenque,  I ordered the veggie fajitas and the second time I ordered the same...I guess that's a resounding thumbs-up for the food.  My husband loves enchiladas and they don't disappoint at Palenque. The staff is really friendly and makes the experience that much better.  In fact, we've only been twice, but on our second visit the owner greeted us and welcomed us back!  That's awfully impressive considering this restaurant has been packed since the day it opened!  My only complaint is that the space is small and, without a vestibule area, the dining room can be cold.  However, that is definitely a minor annoyance and will not deter us from becoming regulars."}
{"text":"Great Margarita and wonderful food and service. Had the steak, chicken and shrimp combo fajitas and they were delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and prices! We have been going to Palenques since it opened and greatly enjoy it. There is a varied menue and a bar. Don't forget the marguaritas"}
{"text":"Stopped in for late lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the great food and excellent service.  The chicken Fajitas were really good an the portions were generous.  I highly recommend this place for fans of Mexican food."}
{"text":"So I found this place based on reading the reviews here on Yelp.  Sounds worth a try.  Small,brightly decorated, pleasant staff, impressive menu options. Fast service.  The guac is freshly made. So is the Pico.  Dinners came out hot, fresh and tasty.  Generous portions and full of flavor.  An appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 Modelos each for 35 bucks and change.  That's hard to beat. We will be back."}
{"text":"What a lovely surprise. Just had the BEST carnitas and seafood enchiladas. Great food, affordable and beautiful tables and chairs. Just a little jewel!"}
{"text":"Went there first time for lunch with my hubby. Great food! The special lunch plates were excellent. The warm tortilla chips and salsa were wonderful. Lots of good vegetarian options as well as great stuff for the carnies. Great service and good prices, also! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican I've found in Madison. Margaritas are good, service is always friendly and good and the food..... INCREDIBLE."}
{"text":"I was in town for work and was looking for a place for lunch other than fast food. I stopped in only to find two tables full of cute elderly ladies having their monthly card group. :) I ordered and quickly received my food. It was well-prepared and very tasty. The gentleman who waited on me was very pleasant and attentive. I will certainly go back again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 20 times since it has opened. The service is top notch, the food is amazing and the prices are beyond reasonable. The chips and salsa are fresh and try the queso dip. It is a smaller place and quite popular."}
{"text":"Really nice staff that care about the restaurant and its customers. The food was very tasteful with fresh ingredients. The cost was fairly priced, too. 

Just an overall great experience and I look forward to going back. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"we love this place!
so many great choices to choose from and so reasonable and great taste.
every time we've been in tried something different, everything from taco sald to steak or chicken fajita's, chimichanga, combination dinners on and on!
staff always treats you great and all so kind.
beautiful decor!
just fun to be there!"}
{"text":"I couldn't be more in love with a Mexican restaurant. If the hole in the wall feel doesn't get you first it's the deliciousness of their food. 

I haven't had food, service, prices, etc. this good since I lived in Chicago and had gone to college in Platteville. 

The salsa is fresh and has the prefect balance of ingredients nothing like the blandness that I've had in most places around Madison. The fajitas are to die for and they actually give you a good portion of meat with your money. The guacamole also has my heart, it's fresh and also balances it's ingredients well. Horchata is even YUM! 

You actually get what you pay for here and that's important to me. Large portions that will leave you so full that they need to roll you out the door like Violet in Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. 

Yes, the place is small, but who cares I love the intimate atmosphere and it makes it easier for the wait staff to see who needs to be served next or wants refills. Who knows, maybe they'll be successful enough one day to open a bigger location. 

Considering I have been trying to find a Mexican restaurant that I can't wait to go visit again for five years it's safe to say that I'm an extremely satisfied."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now and will be going back. I love that all the tables and chairs were handmade in Mexico (it literally makes you feel like you are in Mexico.) I love that they serve pitchers of margaritas. I love that they give you warm chips and salsa the moment you arrive. I love their cheese sauce although probably incredibly unhealthy for you. And I love their Molcajeta fajitas! YUM!"}
{"text":"This fabulous hole in the wall is much needed in the area. We arrived at 11:00, right as they opened for lunch. This joint is new, we were the only ones, my partner and I. We were worried for them, fearing we would be the only patrons during what should have been a busy lunchtime.

Psych! Within 10 minutes, every brightly colored, carved table and chair were filled by diners. Complimentary, warm chips and salsa were on our table before we could open the menus. Our waiter was extremely polite, got the job done efficiently. We indulged in some 11AM Modelos and they knew to remove enough of the gold foil so we didn't have to BYOToothpicks.

We ordered a smothered burrito of sorts and some enchiladas. Both portions were generous, taking home left overs of both (mmm, actually a good lunch). My only complaint was the overly-plentiful sour cream blob that, due to its size, was more challenging than usual to remove and use as a side. The enchilada sauce was deep, rich. The burrito sauce was super cheesy, filling with long, delicious pieces of pork. One of my top McFarland faves."}
{"text":"What a great find! The food was delicious and came quickly. The only negative was how much sour cream came on my plate. We'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch with my mom while she was in town.  We were immediately seated, served water and chips and salsa.  The salsa--yummmmmm!!! And the chips were nice and crisp, not stale like they'd been sitting out all lunch hour.  The menu is extensive, but not overwhelming.  They over a lot of favorites, some specialties, combination plates and lunch specials.  
We both got the fish tacos.  They were served with either corn or flour tortillas and they came out quick and hot.  The fish and tacos were on plate, the rice/tomatoes/lettuce/avocado on another and the pico de gallo in it's own bowl so you could BYO taco.  I did put some of the yummy salsa on my taco as well, just to add some more juiciness.  I could only finish 2 of the 3 tacos, but they provided a box for taking it home.  They did try to clean up the plates before we were finished boxing everything up though, so wasn't very happy with that.
All in all, we paid just under $20 for two filling lunches.  I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Arrived in town on business from Canada and as usual I like to search out a good Mexican restaurant.  Stopped in here on a warm afternoon and was greeted by a huge smile from the waiter, who was just fabulous (others could learn from him!).   

The food - I ordered a Burrito Mexicana, it arrived very quickly and on a nicely warmed plate.  I wouldn't call it large but it was perfect for lunch, and most importantly it was delicious!

A place added you my list :-)"}
{"text":"I'm going to give this a 5
Food great- I was impressed with the serving size and I loved they gave me an adequate amount of sour cream. 
Service excellent-
Seated fast, we got our dinner in less then 10mi. Our server made sure our drinks were always full as well as our chip bowl and he was friendly.  We were in a little rush that light and we were in and out within 30min.
The only thing that would make it better would be more booths and they should paint the ceilings black so it's a little darker...just offering a better atmosphere"}
{"text":"Thought I needed to check this place out by all the positive reviews, you Yelpers steered me right again! Everybody in my party said that they would do it again, been to Mexico recently and have rated a few other Mexican restaurants,this one has nice portions of flavorful food at a reasonable price. With.nice service and a colorful look. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I had the fish tacos and it came with rice and avocado. Every bite was fresh and so delicious. I so impressed with the chairs that was imported from Mexico. We was there to do a cable install and the owners made us feel like we was there guest at there house so welcoming. so after the install he invited us to lunch. The staff was also friendly from the cook to the waiters. I love this place."}
{"text":"Grabbed carryout chimichangas and enchiladas after a friend's recommendation. Great prices, great service (fast!), and great food."}
{"text":"Pros: Good portions, great food (that's really what you're here for right?), good variety of menu options, good margaritas. A place that makes their own horchata! The salsa is above average. 

Cons: Small seating area that exposes you to the outside weather when people come and go, the rice and beans are pretty plain, decor is flashy, but a little tacky. 

None of the cons are really cons enough to consider not going though"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Treat the staff well and they will make sure you are more than taken care of. They knew me by name after my second visit, always greeted with a handshake. My only advice is have a partner to finish a bigger size of blended Margs. I drink but these bad boys made me feel bad because I probably didn't even finish half. On the rocks is easier to drink. But when ya feelin fancy on a summer day, what you gonna do. I always get the same thing. Arroz con carne. The only place around that I will clean the plate. I'd give more stars if I could. Love this place."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food, friendly service, good salsa. If you opt to order takeout, check your order before you leave. We've done it four times, and four times we've gotten all the way home only to find our order was wrong or something was missing. That's my only complaint."}
{"text":"Not as good as laredos. Nice folks, great service. I'll go back because I work nearby but otherwise I would not go there. I would not object to going there either though if with a group. I got a combo for lunch, very affordable. 

*Update
Half of the times I go there they've overcharged me for a simple lunch order for one. I've learned to review my receipt before I pay. It has happened so many times I believe they do it on purpose and are stealing from customers. It's a shame. I will not return."}
{"text":"We tried Palenque Mexican Bar & Grill last Friday evening.  It's in a little strip mall right on Highway 151 and doesn't look like much from the outside.  Once inside, it's pretty festive.  Carved, brightly painted, wooden chairs and tables fill the area and there are colorful adornments on the wall.  We were greeted by a cheerful host, seated and given menus and shortly afterwards our server arrived to brings chips and salsa and take drink orders.

The menu is fairly standard Tex-Mex with a few combination platters and various entree options.  The prices were quite reasonable especially considering the portion sizes.  The salsa was fresh, mild, and very tasty.  When we ran out of chips, the waiter was quick too ask if we wanted more.  They also had several hot sauces at the table which I always enjoy.  We had the Carne Asada and an enchilada platter.  The beans and rice both had great texture.  The meat was perfectly cooked.  The enchiladas were mildly spicy with good flavor.

Atmosphere, service, and tasty food.  This is a solid choice for Mexican food in the area."}
{"text":"I typically reserve my 5 star ratings for the best of the best and I will have to say that this place deserves all 5!!! We were passing through this little town and were looking for some place for lunch.  With limited options we settled on this place because it had good reviews.  Neither of us were super hungry so we were going to just stop at the Subway next door but always like trying new places.  While we were being seated we noticed the people at the table next to ours had something on their table that looked tasty so we asked what it was.  The dish was called fundito fajitas.  We decided that we would share and order of that and boy were we glad we did.  We both agreed they were the best fajitas we ever had.  The portion was huge and it had great sides.  

The place had a fun atmosphere and our waiter was attentive and friendly.  

I always think everyone could improve and if I had to say anything they could probably use better chips with their salsa maybe?  And also, they only gave you 3 tortillas with the fajitas but there was easily enough meat and veggies to fill 5.  

Can't wait to be back in this area again, because we will return."}
{"text":"I can really do some damage here! I love ordering off of the a la carte menu because I have a hard time deciding, even from the combo platters! The service is great, and I love the food! As a fitness professional all, I appreciate how the meat like the crane asada is not greasy.  There are choices to indulge or eat relatively cleanly if desired! Definitely reasonably priced as well! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"One of those great surprises tucked away in a strip mall! Unquestionably the best Mexican I've found in the area. So far I've had chicken, steak, shrimp, and pork dishes; all high quality and well prepared; tender and not fatty. The flavor and quality has been especially noticeable in the dishes that showcase the meat: carne asada, chile verde (pork), all the shrimp dishes. Camerones a la Diablo-sauce was delicious! very spicy, my new favorite Diablo sauce, though my stomach was regretting it later that day--apparently lost my tolerance to spicy foods since moving to the Midwest. Luckily the other Camerones dishes are tasty too, so I can save Diablo for special occasions. Then to top it all off, the chile verde sauce was ridiculously good too! --great balanced lime, tomatillo, and spice. I'll always make sure someone at my table orders something with the verde sauce so I can at least get a taste."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had!!! Staff is always present and friendly. Most authentic Mexican atmosphere in the Madison area. I personally love their giant burrito, filled with the best of everything. Also have a very nice birthday surprise if mentioned. Absolutely would recommend to anyone in the area. Best restaurant in McFarland and one of the best in the Madison area!"}
{"text":"I've been to this 5-7 times in the past few months. Was impressed with the food every time! Margaritas are delicious. Dine in can get busy sometimes, but when you order takeout they usually have it done in 10 min."}
{"text":"I ordered a combination plate of chile relleno and chicken taco.  The chile relleno was lightly breaded and non-greasy which by far was the best breading I have had on a relleno to date.  The cheese in the middle was very runny and tasteless.  I like a thicker Mexican cheese in my rellenos, such as Chihuahua, and did not care for the relleno because of the filling.  The chicken taco was tasteless and a tad dry, with chicken and a few onions on the bottom, with no flavoring and your typical lettuce and cheese on top.  The warm corn tortilla shell gave it a little extra flavor.  My fiancé ordered the especial Palenque fajitas which was a very hardy serving.  Considering the serving size, they only served it with three small tortillas, and I assume they would have brought out more if requested.  While we were there the music, which is not an important factor in rating this establishment, kept on stopping and wait staff were climbing on chairs to fix it several times.  The lights in the kitchen area also went out at one point when a blender was used.  The wait staff were very friendly and attentive, the restaurant was nicely decorated, we were seated immediately and our food arrived quickly.  Overall our experience was not bad, and we may go back to try something else on the menu.  While others rated this four stars and above, I am only rating it three, as I am comparing my Mexican food to the authentic non-chain smaller establishments in the Chicago area."}
{"text":"Salsa and chips were excellent. Chilli relleno was soggy and red sauce tastes like ketchup. Chicken burrito in green sauce suberb. Guacamole was frozen and mushy."}
{"text":"I'm thrilled for this McFarland addition. Efficient, polite service, the environment is a good sort of tacky, very clean. I received my warm chips and salsa immediately and my food quite quickly. Most importantly, you will end up with a steaming plate LOADED with food. They don't skimp on the good ingredients one bit, they're not just filling you up on bread or lettuce. Prices are in line with the quality and portions. There's no good reason to dislike this joint.

I recommend the spinach quesadilla."}
{"text":"Outstanding Mexican food!  This is what the Madison area has been needing for quite awhile.  Since finding this place a month ago, I've visited 5 more times with friends and family for lunch and dinner and have been very pleased every time. 

The fish tacos are awesome.  Taquitos/flautas were great.  The \"special dinner\" has some of everything and was amazingly good.  They have flan...that's really all I needed to see on the menu to know it was going to be a great place!  

Palenque (pa-len-kay) is located in a strip mall across Hwy 51 from Culvers and next door to Subway.  They opened only about 4 months ago.  Huge, diverse menu.  There are about 12 or so tables.  The lunch crowd is building, and the dinner crowd seems solid, but I've not had to wait for a table yet...but probably soon... 

Service was excellent, friendly, just-right.  Great margaritas.  Prices are very good.  Very good kids menu.  

Fun and tasty - can't wait to go there again!"}
{"text":"We were hungry, and in the area, so we stopped in here because the Yelp reviews were raving. I had two spinach enchiladas. They were completely hidden under two to three inches of white cheese sauce. When they brought the plate to my table, I thought I had just been delivered a pool of runny cheese with rice and beans. It turns out, after careful excavation, there were in fact two little spinach enchiladas under there! I deliberately tried to eat around the pool of white, because I am seriously not a big fan of the white goop. However, some of it got on my face, and to my horror, was quite sticky. 

So there I was, with this sticky Elmer's glue substance on my face in the middle of the restaurant. At first I panicked, and I quickly tried to wipe it away with my hand. But it was still there. So then I tried to act more civilized and used my napkin, which promptly stuck to the food grade goo on my face. What the hell was going on?!?! 

My dining companion had two beef enchiladas in \"red sauce.\" It turns out \"red sauce\" is code for spiced up ketchup. He did not suffer a food malfunction, because his dish did not come with a 50 gallon drum of industrial cheese sauce, however, he was woefully underwhelmed by the quality of his dish.

Breakin' it down:

Pros
1) Nice staff
2) Cool decor
3) Good prices
4) Plenty of seating

Cons
1) Mystery white cheese sauce AKA. plaster of paris?
2) Mediocre to inedible food
3) 1 & 2 are deal breakers

I'm sure all the 5 star reviewers of this place will be flaming me shortly, but it won't work because I am covered in white cheese sauce which doubles as flame retardant. SNAP!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican around.  Great staff, very attentive.  I try to eat here about once a month and never disappointed.  The Chile R is hard to do in a restaurant and theirs is always great.  Combos are a great deal and well done.  Looks a little chain-ish but don't let that fool you,  some good stuff happening here.  They always have customers but never had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Very delicious and authentic Mexican food! My place to go when I don't feel like leaving town, ever rivals restaurants downtown Madison. I'd avoid their frozen margaritas, not nearly as good as on the rocks. Also no margarita deals during the week, which is disappointing. The good food makes up for it. If you're going on the cheap, their a la carte options are very cost effective."}
{"text":"I love coming here. The chips n salsa are very good and great margaritas. Try the pina-colada margaritas, really good. The dinners are so filling it's hard to move. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Mexican food."}
{"text":"We went tonight (Friday) around 6:15pm. Only waited about 10-15 minutes. Food was great! My husband and I ordered the Burrito Carne Asada and the Burrito Mexicano. Being foodies living in this small town we also ordered Beef Soft Tacos to see what they were like (in addition to the fact that we were told through word of mouth from friends that have eaten at the Beaver Dam location that they are good). I'd have to say that overall our experience was really good. Staff was very friendly, helpful, and quick. I ordered a traditional margarita on the rocks (good, but only slightly too sweet for my liking). One of the very impressive things we learned was that they make their own cheese!!!!! Outstanding flavor too!!! Bill was $30-ish including a margarita, two burrito entrées, and 3 beef soft tacos. I'm giving four stars because the establishment is too small to accommodate for a waiting area (wait line was in the hallway by the bathrooms), and because the smallest table seated four. I highly encourage people to come here and enjoy traditional Mexican fare!   ¡Salud!"}
{"text":"Very good traditional Mexican food ! Please know the place inside is small with 5 topper tables so bring more then two friends lol but other then that situation they will figure out, but for now il stick to pick up"}
{"text":"What a great addition to McFarland!  Went for dinner last night and there was a wait.  The carnitas was amazing!  It's going to be hard to order anything different next time.  I would skip the margarita next time though.  It was nothing to rave about.  Great service even though they were slammed.  Chips and salsa were great.  Chicken chili verde was average.  So glad to have this close to home and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Whoa people! This may be the best kept secret of McFarland, WI. I almost don't want you to know about it, even when it's bad for me, I can't keep this good of a secret (Protip: don't tell me important secrets, they are not safe with me).

This gem is hiding in plain sight, on the side of the dance floor, just waiting for you to come ask for a dance.  And oh what a delicious dance it is!

I am on a spirit quest to find the best chilaquiles, and their's rates very high. The seasoned chicken was a revelation and oh the cheese! So much delicious delicious cheese!

Next time, I think I will up my game and order my favorite (at the moment) chilaquiles with some over easy eggs. A runny yolk just upgrades everything.

Their carne asada is probably the best in Madison, this is no lie, I know my carne asada.

To top it all off, the service is great and they have unlimited chips with really good salsa. I don't know if life gets better than unlimited free chips and that's just the start. Palenque knows no bounds!"}
{"text":"Palenque is easy to miss, but you should make a point to seek it out if you enjoy Tex-Mex favorites. Located in a strip mall on 51 in McFarland, it'll be on your right if you're heading away from Madison. The exterior of the strip mall isn't anything to rave about, but once you set foot in Palenque your spirit will lift with all the bright colors. The chairs and tables are (presumably hand-)painted and depict a range of scenes including cacti, parrots, and architecture. 

My go-to for a new place is a chicken chimichanga. I was very happy with my choice. The chimichanga was large and filled with flavorful chicken. It was also covered in a healthy dose of queso, taking it to the next level. The beans served on the side still had some texture to them and the rice soaked up the excess queso, making a delightful treat of its own. The chimi is also served with a good pile of lettuce, pico, sour cream, and guacamole on the side. 

Prices were affordable and service friendly. I have a couple other places closer to my home that are my go-tos for Mexican food, but I definitely need to work Palenque into the mix."}
{"text":"Had the fish tacos as did my daughter. They came fast. And we're served so could assemble to taste. Fish was well prepared. Salsa was delicious. Great value for the money. Two meals can feed three. Only flaw was the busses kept trying to take my plates of food away as I was trying to package my leftovers."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!! Food was amazing, service was spot in, margaritas were fabulous!!! We will definitely be back! Great job guys!"}
{"text":"My go to dish is Shrimp Chilaquiles (hot yummy plate of perfection!)... oh my,my, my.... My husband usually, but not always gets Steak Gringo... steak, salad, French fries...I tease him it's not very Mexican... he tells me he's a Gringo...."}
{"text":"I came here after my cousin recommended it. I passed it twice before I found it, but thankfully I finally did. The server was very attentive and friendly, and the salsa for the complimentary chips was fresh and delicious. When I visited, my son and I both ordered the spicy chicken chimichanga. The chicken inside had the perfect amount of spice and you get a significant portion of the toppings on the side, which were beans, pico de gallo, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, and guacamole. I liked how it was not quite as fried as chimichangas found elsewhere. My wife ordered the chilaquiles and enjoyed them as well. While I live a good distance away from McFarland, I will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I've been here a few times, and each time has been superb. Knocking off one star for a burnt entree last visit. Was made up for."}
{"text":"This place is really good and definitely provides some well needed options to the fish fry saturated land that is McFarland. The atmosphere is fun with lots of color, painted tables/chairs, and a cozy feel. There service is very attentive, quick, and friendly to boot.

Chips and salsa are served right and the chips were served warm (yay!). The salsa is okay - a crowd pleaser red salsa, not too spicy, not too anything really...

We ordered a round of lime house margaritas on the rocks - standard margarita fair, a little too sweet for me, but nothing out of the ordinary. 

The food seems to be more of a tex-mex approach to Mexican - but that does not stop it from being delicious. The purveyors definitely understand that serving lengua in McFarland probably won't get them far - a good call! Generous portions are served with all the fixings including guacamole at no additional charge! What? The cuisine is whipped up in record time and is more than reasonably priced.

The fella and I decided to split the steak fajitas and we were each given a huge helping of rice, beans, lettuce, pico de gallo, and guacamole on the side along with tortillas (choice of corn or flour). The meal was more than enough to split and the waiter even boxed it up for us when we quickly realized we could not finish it all!

I would definitely go to this establishment again. Delicious!"}
{"text":"From the outside, this looks like some sort of hole in the wall joint. On the inside, it looks like a place that is always down for a festive party. Bright colors, bright decor, and the furniture is truly unique. 

I stopped in here on a very long drive. It's in a strip mall on Hwy 51 and pretty easy to get to. Plenty of parking in the shared parking lot. I came in at an off time, but I understand they usually have a line during peak times. Good signs, good signs.

Sat down and had fresh chips and salsa brought out. The salsa was mild, but well flavored. The chips were served warm.

I had some sort of quesadilla. I honestly can't remember the name because I had been driving for around 9 hours by the time I got here, so I was fairly out of it, haha. It's on the menu under the house specials/favorites. I was genuinely surprised when it was served because it was HUGE. (See the picture.) Holy crap, that's a solid two meals right there. I had the chicken and there was so much chicken in it. It was also very, very flavorful. I really, really liked it. The guac was very good, and the pico was heavier on the cilantro which I prefer. Even the rice was delicious, and usually the rice is an afterthought.

I also hear they have great margaritas in a variety of sizes. I saw the medium one come out and it was pretty large, so I'll definitely check those out the next time I'm in Madison and not planning to drive home after eating there.

The prices are low considering how much food you get, but I suppose they're probably appropriate for the area. Oh, Wisconsin, land of large portions and cheap prices at restaurants. I never tire of it! Bonus: food comes out fast without being too fast. They know what they're doing."}
{"text":"If this joint was south of Wisconsin or at least not in a small town, McFarland, I might only give it four stars. Still that would be pretty good.

For a small, midwestern town, you can't find better Mexican food."}
{"text":"Palenque is highly recommended to anyone! This place become our fav. to go place to eat on weekends, I have just about all dishes in their menu, all is excellent! the best of Mexican food ever. This place beats any other Mexican Resto in Madison or any where else, I soon as I opened the door, I was very impressed by the decor, brightly colored walls, very unigue beautifully done crafted tables and chairs, the whole place is tastefully done! Feels like your somewhere in Mexico. Every bite is so good. It does not have the taste of the common Mexican food you'll have every where it tasted like a take out fast food..it has the homemade quality specially crafted cooked food. Fast and friendly service.  I am sensitive to salt / sodium, I ask them to not put salt on anything, they manage to accommodate food restriction without sacrificing the taste. I always have left over to take home and ate it the next day, still the food still the best. We love this place. Palenque deserves more than a 5 star.! In all level!"}
{"text":"Very delicious!! Extremely quick service!! The staff are very friendly.  My husband and I will definitely be back. The place is on the smaller side but we were able to be seated immediately. We both had the chimichangas. I had the spicy chicken and he had the one that had steak, chicken and shrimp. Both amazing!  The chips and salsa are also very good! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had a family dinner here on a Friday night. Short wait for the six of us, but worth it. We started with chips and salsa and a pitcher of Margaritas. We ordered a variety of dinners and no complaints from anyone. Portions are large, food was flavorful and hot, and prices are very reasonable. All of us want to return and try more. The menu is huge! The staff is friendly and accommodating. Hope to get back there soon. As we were leaving we saw a sign that they are expanding! Good news!"}
