{"text":"Stopped by based on the yelp reviews. Amazing customer service. The owner personally greeted us and helped with the lunch selection. I had the Cubano which was exactly what I was looking for even if I didn't know it at the time lol. There were quite a few customers, and the staff cranked out all of the orders including to-go orders. The wait wasn't very long at all. Great grilled sandwich that's reasonably priced. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place knows good food and serves it with a friendly smile!  I could (and mostly do!) eat there everyday and never tire of the menu.  Hands-down my go to lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this morning on the way to a training class after searching Yelp for a breakfast spot nearby. It's a small place located in an office building.

I ordered a breakfast burrito and it did not disappoint, The owner Brian was very nice and gave me suggestions for the Angus burger that I asked about for lunch. I will definitely be back :-)"}
{"text":"Great experience, wonderful food and enjoyable staff.  Don't let the size of this place fool you; it may be small but the food has BIG flavor.  I went with a number of co-workers for lunch with only an hour to spare including drive time.  The owner and staff were down right pleasant, appreciative for the business, efficient and, to top it off, deliver a great product.  I had the mushroom and brie soup, which easily makes it into my top 10.  Their Ruben is on point and they don't skimp on the meat.  We'll be back, tell our friends and probably even order for delivery.  KUDOS!"}
{"text":"A little hidden place but really good. I went in and had a burger and it was really good. I will definitely be coming back when I'm in the area for lunch."}
{"text":"Heard about this little deli from some coworkers last week so I decided to stop in and give them a try and boy I was amazed the staff was unbelievably friendly and the place was so clean. I ordered the house Veggie Burger and it was to die for! The bun was so soft and the veggie burger was like no other, come to find out its a family recipe they use. I'm a vegetarian and I have never tasted a veggie burger like this definitely will be back for this one!"}
{"text":"Their breakfast burritos are awesome and they have great daily specials!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  
A great little place that has received so many wonderful reviews and has earned every one of them.  Superb sandwiches, excellent deserts and always with great customer service and smiles."}
{"text":"I love this deli. The owner Brian is fantastic, and he knows how to deliver spectacular customer service. Their omelets are superb, but I always have to get the Daily Special when Brian or his mother-in-law are cooking one of the many family recipes for the day such as the meatloaf.  

When I am not \"low carbing\" it with their City Cobb salad, I'm usually enjoying their Kabob Sandwich with extra hummus.  

Everything from their Jambalaya to their hoagies make for a great lunch."}
{"text":"Great little find with excellent food. Had the sandwich special, Deer Valley Special. Seems to be order and leave type place,a bit small inside but not uncomfortable. The sandwich was great and more than I could finish. Came with a side, choices are all your pasta and potato type salads, cottage cheese, or hot Mac n cheese and a fountain drink. Same price as if I were to get some fast food combo but much more satisfying."}
{"text":"Great deli, good sandwiches, soups and salads. And the customer service was top notch. Would definitely recommend this place for a quick casual lunch. We had the BLAST (bacon lettuce avocado Swiss and tomato), chicken salad, lemon chicken soup and Cobb salad were all delicious. There is no sign out front so just look for it by the address."}
{"text":"Ordered from this establishment for delivery through Eat24. Very Pleased. Order was successfully delivered within 5 minutes of expected delivery time to my front door. We ordered the Italian Melt sandwich combo and everything was accurate, fresh and a good amount of meat. Also ordered the B.L.A.S.T. sandwich and, again, very fresh and delicious. I intended to take a pic to share the presentation but it smelled so good I started eating right away. First time trying this place out and for $3 delivery I would definitely give them my return business and recommend them to anyone looking for a good breakfast/lunch spot."}
{"text":"You NEED to try this place.The only down side is the lack of seating with how busy this place is, but if you came here to eat quality deli food you have found the place. As many others have stated the owner is awesome and actually takes the time to ask you how your food was (when it is not super slammed and he gets a second). I usually go with the Cobb Salad, Chili Dog, Ruben, or Turkey sandwich. I have also had their tuna sandwiches and a  mushroom burger all of which were equally as good. I am a bit of a fan boy when it comes to this place. Thanks for being such a good place."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat! I had never been here before so I decided to try it out. The food, atmosphere, and service were all fantastic. The City Square Burger was moist and delicious. I look forward to to coming back again."}
{"text":"A few co workers and i ordered delivery for lunch and the process was super easy and quick. The food was absolutely delicious, the angus steak to the bun and fresh toppings were  by far the best burger i have had. The greek pasta salad was very fulfilling and flavorful. We even had the pleasure of meeting with the owner, he stopped by to see how our food was and to thank us for our buisness,  which i thought was so awesome because you can truly see how much pride he has in his customer service and his amazingly delicious food. Thanks again on behalf of the girls at Nation Wide Vision"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were vacationing in Phoenix and decided on a whim to try this place. All I can say is amazing! Very friendly and fast. Perfect service. Their Angus Steak burger was spot on, in quality and taste. If you are ever in the area, I highly recommend you check this place out. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a bunch of co workers one day just to do something different. It was hard to find but we found it. It looked like a little deli, and was kinda discouraged at first, but it's a whole lot more the service is amazing the selection of food is amazing and the service is amazing. I have never had hot dogs as good as the ones they made as well as their burgers. If your in the area make sure you stop in for lunch. This place is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"This Place is amazing!! Everyone is super friendly and the food is awesome!!! Not common for me to give five stars, but this place rocked it! It's clean, food is fresh and the employee customer service skills are through the roof! From the cashier to the one's preparing the food. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This little sandwich shop is awesome! Have only been here once, but we both enjoyed our meal and the staff. The only thing that I would consider a negative is that it's in a financial services building and so it's difficult to find. There is no signage at all, and I suspect that's because of its location."}
{"text":"Wow. Pretty unassuming when you walk in but some of the best, reasonably quick food I've had. We came in because of the Yelp reviews and were not disappointed. The wonderful food was only surpassed by the wonderfully knowledgeable woman behind the iPad register. Very helpful, kind and professional. The Mac & cheese was outstanding, and the NY sandwich with pastrami was delightful. Thanks for my new favorite place in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Found this little gem on Yelp, and decided to give it a try. Needless to say,  City Square Deli & Grill did not disappoint! We had a a quick breakfast on our way up to  the Verde Valley, and their 5 stars are well deserved. The B.E.A.S.T breakfast sandwich and the sausage and egg breakfast burrito was our first of many meals to come. This will be our new go to spot for well prepared food and friendly service, during our monthly drive up to wine country. Conveniently located just minutes from I-17,  a must try!"}
{"text":"Best Mushroom Brie Soup ever, Just like Norsdtroms. The food selection is always fresh and amazing"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch for the first time a couple days ago. At first, I was skeptical because of where it was located (inside an office building?!?) However, the food was AMAZING- and the service was even better. It was clear  that all the ingredients used were top notch, and the sandwiches were put together with care. Highly recommend this place. Definitely will be back to try more! (Ordered: the Greek and Italian sandwich- both were excellent)"}
{"text":"Very filling and a great price! Picture perfect burgers every time and delicious pickles:)"}
{"text":"Wow, this was my first time there and I must say the food and service deserves every part of this five star. It was just a couple miles off the freeway for this clean and cozy spot. I met the owner who was cool and down to earth. I watch the chef prepared my meal that was proportionate, and had great presentation. Most of all, it was delicious. I had the chorizo breakfast burrito but will be back again to try their Ruben sandwich"}
{"text":"I was on the north side of the city and needed to grab a sandwich before heading back to the East Valley.  I did a Yelp search and City Square popped up with excellent ratings so I decided to give it a shot.

The deli is right inside the entrance to an office building so keep an eye open to make sure you find it.  I had the albacore tuna sandwich and it was very good.  The portion size was large but not too large.  The tuna had a good flavor and the amount of mayonnaise was minimal which I like.

The staff was friendly and helpful.  The sandwich was an excellent value for the price paid."}
{"text":"Haven't had something on their menu I don't like and the service is great! Quick, easy and great prices!"}
{"text":"It's a bit hard to find but check the pics posted on here and find this place- it's totally worth it! i got the garden lovers sandwich and it was tasty, fresh and totally satisfying. The owner, i think suggested i try the vegetable burger. I was visiting for work but it's on my list for the next time! Also staff was super friendly and they were quick."}
{"text":"Have had their burger and breakfast burrito - both were delicious. Wish they had fries for the burger, but they do have a bunch of other side choices. 

Love that they serve breakfast all day! I'll be back often just because of that. 

Very friendly staff. Inviting. It's going on my list of regular lunch stops."}
{"text":"New lunch spot!  Great Greek Wrap and pasta salad!"}
{"text":"Yes, it is not the easiest to find. 6 star good.  The chicken salad sandwich on multigrain heaping with chicken salad. The special pesto chicken panini very moist and full of flavor. Oh my gosh the Ruben. Fabulous. Two choices of brewed ice teas   This was a superb find. We will come back and try the chipotle chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Awesome deli! Ruben sandwich is lean,tasty, juicy, and just the right amount of kraut and 1000! We also had an italian sandwich, pastrami, and even breakfast. Hot or cold, they have it all! Service is fast and friendly. It may be a bit difficult to locate the first time, it is in the lobby of an office building but, worth the search! One of my clear favorites!"}
{"text":"We went to this small, out of the way deli because of other reviews on Yelp. It is oddly situated in an office building and I didn't have great expectations. I was wrong. The food was excellent!  My salad was fresh and was full of wonderful strawberries and walnuts. The two others in my party had the albacore tuna wrap and a Rueben. We were all very happy with our lunches. This place is a little gem."}
{"text":"Second visit and as good as the first! This quaint little gem is tucked in an office building along 19th Avenue in Northwest Phoenix. The deli menu is extensive and reasonably priced. I had the NY Pastrami on rye sandwich and it was outstanding. It was garnished with thousand island dressing and coleslaw....perfect! My companion had the greek salad- a fairly large serving loaded with feta cheese, olives, onions and dressing-delish! 
The staff is friendly and attentive. We went during the busy lunchtime but got our order relatively quickly. Definitely a must try place!!!"}
{"text":"A little hard to find, but worth driving out of your way!  The staff has a passion for excellence and it shows from the moment you walk in to the afterglow of a fantastic lunch.  This time I did the Chicago Dog which is a snappy big guy with all the right ingredients.  Last time it was the Italian Melt on a roll with a ton of meat and that awesome mix of the Italian dressing with the lettuce and tomatoes.  

Don't get me started on the service.  Simply world class.  I would love to know how they get such a concentration of employees who care about the customer!  Disney, Hilton or any company or owner who cares about customers should come by with a notepad (and an appetite)."}
{"text":"I was about to select the vegetarian sandwich when the gentlemen (owner, I think?) directed me towards their homemade veggie burger.  So glad he did!  Usually I like some cheese on my faux burgers but this didn't even need it.  He rattled off a long list of veggies in the burger and while I don't remember them, I DO remember a nice kick from the jalapeno.

My mac'n cheese side was delish.  All in all, a great experience!  

It's a teensy bit hard to find as it's actually inside an office building but look for the tables with the Deitz and Watson umbrellas and you're there."}
{"text":"Great LITTLE place, food was good and priced fair. 
The only thing that was disappointing was everything was in plastic to go containers and we ate there. Just not eco friendly that way... Will go back and try again."}
{"text":"OMG AMAZING!!

I ordered a French Dip from here at 12:22 pm and the notice was I would have it by 1:22 pm.  The sandwich and drink arrived at my office at 12:36 pm and was HOT, and SUPER DELICIOUS! Probably the best French Dip I've ever had, and I had mac/cheese as my side, and it was creamy and yummy.  I'll be ordering from them on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great customer service! I love the strawberry avocado salad. It's always fresh and the raspberry vinaigrette dressing compliments it perfectly. I go here once a week and hope it's always this good!!"}
{"text":"Great place off of 19th ave to stop for breakfast or lunch! I love supporting local business and they are good people. Try the Ruben and if they it, the jambalaya is killer."}
{"text":"This place is delish! The food is super fresh, service amazing and the owner is a downright genuine guy. Grab some napkins because you'll need them. Sandwiches were amazing for my entire family."}
{"text":"A great little deli in an unexpected location. The paninis were delicious, the salad crisp and fresh and The Reuben hot dog worth the long drive to find it,"}
{"text":"Great options to choose from. Prices are excellent! All though it was busy our sandwiches were out fast. Excellent customer service! I appreciated the owner introducing himself to his customers. It's a small places that serves great food! Gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Great little spot! The customer service was spot on. Even offered us free macaroons while we tried to decide what to eat. I had the steak and cheese combo with potato salad. Sandwich was delicious and the potato salad topped it off quite well. I want to go back ASAP and try other menu items along with trying the breakfast for sure. Please check this spot out"}
{"text":"save me some of that lemon rice soup!!!!!!! please.... soooooooooooooo #scrumpsh #delish #love"}
{"text":"Great food, clean environment, very pleasant & friendly staff, I will most definitely be back! It is located inside of a financial building so there's really not many signs until you walk in but is easy to find once you get inside the building. One thing I wish they had: grilled cheese  

Per Brian S @ City Square Deli & Grill; I tried the grilled cheese and it was indeed amazing. I'd give this place 10 stars if it was allowed :) thanks Brian!"}
{"text":"There chipotle burger was amazing and we are happy that they delivered through uber eats now. They did forget my potato salad thats the only reason they get 4 stars instead of 5"}
{"text":"Good food and great friendly people.  Mostly salads, sandwiches and burgers (no fries).  It's probably best for takeout or delivery as there is very limited seating."}
{"text":"I had the chicken salad sandwich and it was very good. The deli could be hard to find because there are no outside signs. Went about lunch time it wasn't very busy at all and I was served super fast. The only reason I didn't list five tats was that they keep it frigid cold inside and it was hard to enjoy the sandwich."}
{"text":"Was driving around in the area, went to yelp and found this place. I ordered the City Square Classic, The bread was fresh ,lettuce was Crisp , and the meat portions were very generous ordered it with the baked mac and cheese side all I can say is WOW!!! what flavor they packed into this club sandwich this is definitely the new HOT SPOT! Cudos City Square Deli for a small place you delivered big time!"}
{"text":"This place is a weekly lunch spot of ours. My co-workers have ordered lunch for delivery, and it has always arrived in a timely manner, hot, and only cost a $3 delivery fee which went to the driver. I have ordered online for pick up on multiple occasions, and my food was always ready on time. I have also eaten at the outside patio, as there are only about 3 or 4 small tables inside. I have yet to have a bad meal there, and I have heard nothing but amazing reviews from my co-workers. If you are looking for a great lunch, with very reasonable pricing, this is a place to go. 

The only \"bad\" thing I could say about this place is it is a little difficult to find. It's in an office building, and there isn't any signs or indication that this little gem is located there. Look for the red and yellow umbrella on a table outside the building."}
{"text":"Yum! Good food and friendly staff. The only complaint I have is I very rarely have weekdays off so I won't be able to eat here very often."}
{"text":"Really enjoy their Garden Lovers sandwich - Hummus, Feta cheese, Kalamata Olives, Alfalfa Sprouts, Tomato, Red Onions, Bell Peppers, Cucumbers and Balsamic Vinaigrette on Multi-Grain Bread."}
{"text":"The owner and his crew were very courteous and pleasant. The restaurant was quaint. The prices are good. The food was above average. But if you cant decide from the menu, they have daily specials and daily soups to choose from. I will be going back."}
{"text":"I just got home from a trip to San Francisco it was raining when we got there and needless to say I caught a cold, feeling like all I want to do is sleep but need to be at work. Needed to get something delivered to me for lunch and when I called to see what the soup of the day was I was pleasantly surprised to hear Chicken with rice lemon soup. It sounded good, soothing for my sore throat, warn to help my stuffy head.
I ordered a large and was so happy I had, all I want to do is have a gallon ready to pick up and have for the weekend. I could eat this every week. Such great flavor and so comforting. Thanks to Brian and his staff I'll be back for more!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty sandwiches and very friendly service. It's in an office building, but don't be scared off, it's worth the stop in! They get their sandwich breads delivered fresh every morning and the sandwiches have a variety of flavors. They apparently also cater as they mentioned that they just finished catering for 100+ people right before we cane in."}
{"text":"What a gem to find this place near my office. The BLAST was delicious and the pasta salad was good with a hint of spicy. The coconut, chocolate chip and macadamia nut cookie was amazing (I'm hooked). You can tell the owner takes pride in his food quality and taste. Will definitely become my go to spot for lunch. Thanks Brian for being such a gracious host."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices and great people. Here from dallas so a lucky find. Just inside the Deer Valley Financial center so pretty easy to find"}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop in and get a delicious breakfast or lunch.  
They are friendly and always willing to accommodate request.  
If you ever ate in the joint that was there before you definitely should give this place a try again.  So much better.  

The Chicken Salad Sandwich is great and most everything I have tried has been delicious."}
{"text":"We were on our way back from a week long Lake Powell boat trip and were hungry for lunch. After researching Yelp, we took the 1.4 mile off the freeway detour to check it out. So worth it!  We had the Italian panini and the chicken panini. Both were juicy and flavorful on great ciabatta bread. It wasn't a pressed panini, but the bread was so good (baked and purchased fresh daily) that it didn't matter.  We would definitely order these paninis again.  The rest of the menu was also interesting and appealing. When we went up the the counter, Huda asked us if we were new as she didn't recognize us. She was so friendly and welcoming. Brian, the owner, gave my husband some gratis mashed potatoes and gravy left over from the lunch special. He was equally as pleasant and excited about his business. They should give training programs in customer service to other shops. Definitely worth the slight detour off of the freeway. Would seek them out next time en route."}
{"text":"Had the chicken salad sandwich and it was delicious. Ordered from the yelp app and food was ready in less than 10 minutes!"}
{"text":"We checked out yelp reviews for a place to grab a quick breakfast this morning and city Square Deli & Grill popped up. We were intrigued  by the 100+ 5 star reviews so we decided we had to check it out. The first thing we noticed was just how reasonable the prices were for the amount of food that you were getting. We had eggs, hashbrowns, sausage, sourdough toast and pancakes. Everything was quality and delicious. The thing we enjoyed the most was the fantastic attention to detail and customer service. Brian went out of his way to make sure that our satisfaction was not only met but exceeded. Now mind you this is a little deli tucked in the front door and office building. We couldn't imagine the great experience that would be waiting in this level of establishment. It was really good! We don't live in the area, but when we return we will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"Best place for lunch/breakfast all day everyday. Hands down one of the best spots in north Phoenix. I have yet to have one thing that was not amazing. Even their salads are a 10. Berry Blue chicken salad with their homemade ranch is amazing and my go to., breakfast burrito with fresh Salsa in the am.... and they deliver!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a hidden gem inside the ground floor of an office building. Fresh good ingredients for cheap. This is my new favorite lunch spot! Yum!"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and looked on Yelp for a breakfast spot. Didn't realize this place was hidden in large office building. I had the veggie bagel and it was great. Hubby and son had the city square breakfast and they loved it. Great prices for the quality. Owner (think he's the owner) was very nice. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Neat little salad & sandwich place. Hard to find in the corner of the office building (hint - look for the outdoor umbrella). Had the Cuban, which uses bacon in place of the pork. I know....blasphemy.   It actually was very tasty, added a nice saltiness to the sandwich.  Only a handful of tables and chairs indoors."}
{"text":"One of the best Rubens I have ever had!! My buddies had the breakfast special. Looks great all home made and great prices. The staff was super friendly and fast. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away but is totally a gem to seek out. The owner Brian is wonderful and I can tell he takes pride in providing not only amazing food but also amazing customer service. I had the chicken salad and it was by far one of the best I have ever had outside of my own home; even the bread was perfect and fresh.
My husband had a bowl of chili and it was also phenomenal. We plan on being regulars....if amazing food is important to you, you will want to check this place out for yourself. It is rare for me to agree with a 5 star rating, but this place has totally earned it and my continued patronage (yeah, less cooking for me ;)."}
{"text":"Went here with a group from the office. Everyone really enjoyed the food, I had the chicken salad sandwich, it was out of this world. The staff could not have been more friendly. The only draw back I can see is it's a bit hard to find, it's inside an office building, and there's no signage. 

I highly recommend this place for lunch, can't wait to try some of the items on the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"A must try! Quality of the french dip was incredible. Customer service is a lost art these days but they have not forgotten it here! Keep up the great work and quality, I will be returning."}
{"text":"Hidden inside a business complex. Great choice of sandwiches and salads. Really enjoyed this place, super quick."}
{"text":"I had the chipotle chicken sandwich and it was very good. Everything is very inexpensive. They are located inside the financial center. A little hard to find as there is no signage but it's worth it.

I am in the area for business reasons and these reviews have helped me find great places to eat so I hope someone else finds this helpful as well."}
{"text":"Selfishly, I'm glad this place seems non-existent from the road. Less of a rush at peak times means I can get in and out without a wait... but they deserve some big recognition. 

They run a great business here. Prices are very low all things considered and even lower than I'd expect in almost every case even considering the abnormal business location and things. Don't forget - they deliver!"}
{"text":"Went today. Went around 11:30 and the place was packed! They were still super quick. I got a Pesto Chicken sandwich and my friend got the Chipotle Chicken sandwich and they were both awesome. Definitely lived up to the hype. Chicken was perfectly cooked and good quality. The mac and cheese was good as well. I will definitely be returning here. Glad to have them so close to work! Can't wait to try other sandwiches here!"}
{"text":"Ordered omelette. Eggs were fluffy, spinach was fresh, meat was decent (not organic, free range, blah, blah, blah) but they forgot my bacon. Coffee was pretty strong, only packaged creamers, but the lady let me use their milk. Patio breakfast with the pup was perfect!"}
{"text":"The beast with ciabatta bread and turkey instead of bacon. This place is hidden inside a financial center but is certainly worth the trouble of finding. Very kind service as well!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic service and food. When you order a tuna sandwich it really has a lot of tuna and unlike other places isn't mostly bread. Everything is fresh and delicious. I've been here three times without writing a review, but I'm certain that this is the best sandwich shop in the area. 

Without fail the owner chats with and is interested in what their customers like and want to see every time. I sincerely hope this place is around for a long time."}
{"text":"My first stop at this deli.  Got the Ruben combination meal.  Great sandwich,  great side of Mac-n-cheese.   Really nice staff and the place is clean.
If yoy want a good lunch made for you I can honestly recommend stopping here.

Next trip is going to be the Ruben Dog."}
{"text":"A few people in my office and I  ordered food from here yesterday and we are now ordering food again today!! The taco salad and veggie burgers are great and city square classic looked amazing as well."}
{"text":"YUM!  Great little deli...I had a very tasty Ruben with warm mac n cheese for the side, delicious!  My husband had their Italian Melt, which is what we measure sandwich shops by, and City Square definetely does it up right!  All fresh ingredients and the owner(s) really take pride in their food!!  We will definitely be putting this place on our regular eats."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, this family owned deli is always on point with everything they make. Jordan, who runs the registers is always so sweet and makes me the best smoothies!! If you haven't given it a shot, try it, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I'm traveling in from Southern California for work and came across this place on yelp.  With ratings like they have on it was a must try for me and it was amazing. I had the chicken chipotle and it rocked. It's a little hard to find as it's in a business building but well worth it. I'd highly recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Meet the owner of City Square at my job. He told me about his deli and asked me to be his guest for lunch. The deli is located in a office building, great parking, the deli is on the 1st floor just as you enter the building. The place is great!!! This is a true deli place. All different types of sandwiches either cold or hot. The staff is great and friendly. Prices are great and the tater tots are awesome!!! I recommend this deli and I will be regular customer."}
{"text":"Believe the hype, this place has got it going on. I found them with the Yelp app while searching for something that wasn't a chain near my office in Happy Valley. With a rating like this, how could I go wrong? 

As I went inside, I got what the others are saying about the size. This may have previously been a broom closet. :) But make no mistake, there's some good food to be had here. I noted that the soup of the day seemed really good (white cheddar poblano), but I didn't want that and a whole sandwich, so I asked if I could get a soup and half sandwich. Although it's not a standard thing, he said he'd do that for me, which was a very nice gesture. So, I ended up with a half sandwich and cup of soup for a very reasonable price. 

How was it? Awesome. I ordered the above-mentioned soup and a half pastrami reuben. I was advised that the soup was pretty spicy, and upon informing that I was from Texas, I was asked if I wanted some fried, crispy jalapeno chips on top of the soup (yes, please). My order was delivered to my table (one of three, count'em) and I dug in. 

The soup definitely had a pleasing heat, but not too much so. It was very creamy and delicious, with a good cheddar taste and crunch from the topping. The sandwich was served on marbled rye, nicely toasted, with a good balance of meat, dressing, kraut, and Swiss cheese. All of the ingredients were fresh and delicious, the meats were tender and juicy, and the kraut had a nice crunch and \"zing\". 

It made for a nice, sensible meal with no leftovers, and only a mild hit to the pocketbook. If you want a good deli experience in this area, look this place up and check it out!"}
{"text":"Great little place! So glad we stopped for breakfast and plan to come back for lunch soon! No outside signage, but look for the outdoor seating with table umbrellas, from which you can see the intersection of 19th Ave & Williams. Extensive menu for such a little place."}
{"text":"I've bean going here almost daily for lunch since they've opened and I am never disappointed! They have the BEST Red Pepper Gouda soup that pairs perfectly with the grilled cheese! Brian, the owner, is always so polite and professional. The staff are always so welcoming and take a vested interest in their customers by learning their names and being personal with them!! So glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"Husband and I found this place right in our area. It's on the bottom floor corner of an office building but the food is fantastic and the staff are passionate about what they make. Shows in how tasty the food is! Super helpful staff, location was unique and well worth the drive around to find the entrance. 

Will be going back in the near future!

Although we brought our little toddler to eat with us, I wouldn't recommend sitting inside the location to eat with little ones. Especially ones who don't want to sit and stay in their chair while eating. (Which unfortunately we have.) The location is small and not a huge place to sit down with large groups inside. This isn't the fault of the business, its isn't pretending to over accommodate people it can't. I actually like how clean and no nonsense their location is. But my toddler would have easily loved to explore behind the counter, to spare them and us, we didn't stay inside too long. They have tables outside to accommodate more patrons and in the lobby area where you enter. We chose the lobby area to keep the toddler out of trouble. We didn't feel pushed out at all. The staff were helpful opening the door and helping us with our food. I've been to other locations similar to this where they weren't nearly as friendly. I was very impressed with how they treated us."}
{"text":"Located inside the office building, this is great little cafe with fresh made food - including a hand-pressed veggie burger with a hint of Indian spices, so good! Very friendly and efficient service. Nice little outdoor patio in the front of the building with umbrellas."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! I often come here for the burger, perfectly cooked. My friends in the office also frequent this establishment and enjoy it equally. Nice people, great food! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a veggie burger and lucked out by finding the best veggie burger in Arizona. Brian helped us out, He was great. You couldn't ask for a more friendly experience.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing!! great selection, fantastic service! Went with a large group but they were very accommodating and had everything out relatively quickly!"}
{"text":"Decent food. However, I have only eaten from here through Uber Eats and my order has never been correct or complete. Sometimes they have called to clarify my order, and even then it still arrives wrong. The drivers could have just eaten items during the drive, but it's every time. I don't have that issue elsewhere on Uber Eats, so I stopped ordering from here. Additionally, the delivery fee is almost $7 to get a portion of what you ordered with no refund."}
{"text":"such good food here!! they have a wide variety of options and you can tell the staff really loves what they do :) the prices are very reasonable! I got a salad and it was huge and so tasty! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The Bomb! Clean, awesome staff, great food!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here today - their Reuben is to die for! Fresh ingredients, very friendly staff (and owner)! They have healthy \"to-go\" bundles of fruit, cheese, hummus, veggies - lots of variety! First time and I'll be back! Took their menu back to work with us to share"}
{"text":"The owner is an awesome guy!  He delivers to us occasionally and his Reuben's are fantastic.  The Reuben's can be made with pastrami or corned beef and are perfect!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about City Square Deli and Grill. I was looking for a restaurant to cater a funeral reception with approximately 75 people attending but didn't know the head count for sure. I first emailed City Square Deli and promptly received an email back with a phone number to speak with the owner Brian. Brian was professional and very helpful.  Even though we counted about 75 people attending I thought, just in case, I'll order enough food for 100 but Brian said that in his experience not as many people show up to the reception as they do the funeral. He was actually trying to SAVE me money by having me order less but I didn't listen and had him give me a quote for 100 people anyway. After he gave me a price he asked if I would please give him another call after I received all other quotes so he could try to beat the others prices. He said \"I would really like to earn your business\".  He ended up being the lowest quote by about $50. I would have probably used him even if he was higher because I tend to want to give my money to smaller companies rather than chains and because I liked him immediately. The morning of the funeral Brian showed up on time with the most beautifully arranged sandwich trays (not your typical sandwiches), dessert trays, Mac salad and green salad. The sandwiches were cut in half and the halves were HUGE. They were on ciabatta bread, thick marbled bread, sour dough and 3 kinds of wraps. He even threw in individual bags of chips for free!!!!  He also stayed and helped set up the food and utensils.  I was not there but my sister and niece said that he was so nice and very helpful. Also, Brian really knows what he is talking about because approximately 50 people showed up to the reception and we had WAAAAY to much food so I should have listened to him.   I would highly recommend City Square Deli & Grill if you are in need of catering and they are open daily if you are in need of a REALLY good sandwich!"}
{"text":"Had the chipotle chicken, soft bread, fresh veggies, really good sandwich and the service was fast. Looking forward to my next visit. Went around 1:30pm not busy I'm sure anytime before that would be much more of a wait"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Deli ever! Everything on the menu is so fresh and the daily specials they have are outstanding. They are located inside the Deer Valley Finnancial center! I highly recommend trying them out!"}
{"text":"Great place, great food, awesome service. The owner was closing up shop when I stepped in and was kind enough to fire up the grill to make me a burger. He recommended a mushroom and Swiss with pesto sauce. Delish."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great little gem! The owners are just the best and they make a MEAN Reuben!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch with healthy options to eat and snacks to go. Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"What a great Rueben you can choose either corned beef, turkey or pastrami and the flavor was excellent.
Just the right amount of meat to sauerkraut and bread ratio. The workers were so friendly this place is a keeper."}
{"text":"Awesome work lunch gem!! We ordered the Rueben and Blazin Buffalo chicken sandwiches. Fresh bread and cooked to order...stuffed with meats and just enough sauces. Top all that off with great service plus an owner that cares...yes!! Can't wait to come back next week for their BLAST sandwich: bacon, lettuce, avocado,Swiss cheese and tomato! Yum!"}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service and even better sandwiches. Fell in love with this place at first bite."}
{"text":"Located inside of a Bank building, is this hidden gem, City Square Deli and Grill. Delicious food, fresh ingredients, and excellent customer service! 

 If you work in the Deer Valley area, stop here for breakfast or lunch, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Customer service here is excellent! Food is amazing! I love this place! Best sandwich shop in the valley!"}
{"text":"From out of town, Detroit to be exact, and needed something to eat on our way to our final destination. All five of us thoroughly enjoyed our meal and LOVED talking to the owner!!! Us Michiganders need to stick together. The chicken chipotle sandwich was delicious. Would stop again if ever in the area!"}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood and perfect place to grab a bite to go or sit and enjoy. The owner and staff are friendly and willing to answer questions, offer suggestions. Lots of homemade goodness for lunch. Cheaper than fast food, healthier and more delicious. There are your classic wraps, sandwiches, salads, soups & specials. They even make their own veggie burgers!! Glad I found this little gem. It's in an office building and so perfect for grabbing a bite."}
{"text":"You have to try the The CITY SQUARE CLASSIC. If you looking for a good club sandwhich you have to try this one. The bread was as fresh as can be. I added the The chipotle mayo and it just took it over the top. Ill for sure be a regular of this deli spot."}
{"text":"Very cool & family owned, wish I lived close enough to come back and work my way through the menu. I need to remember to try the cubano if I every make it back. At first glance.. we almost walked away but I'm glad we stuck around to eat my plates & our \"little partners\" plate.

Food was good: cob salad & breakfast plate"}
{"text":"I don't know where to start with this place!  I've been to a lot of Deli's in my day (from OR to NY) & I can honestly say that this is the best bang for your buck. 

Recommendations are as followed - 

Big Breakfast for those that had mother's who didn't know how to cook & father's who made them work in the yard for $5 a trench dug. 

Berry Blue Chicken Salad for those that grew up with French painters which knew that abstract flavors (errrr...um colors) could morph into something gorgeous.  In this case it's just damn good. 

Blazin Buffalo Sandwich is the definition of a foodgasm.  Where people I line will stare at you uncomfortably while your pronouncing your love for this Hot Sanwich. 

Props to the team here, they're professional and seem to know what a real deli is suppose to embody."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today and Brian helped me order. Very nice man. Very patient and gave me his full attention while ordering. (Even with many people in line). Ordered for four people. Everyone enjoyed what they ordered. Very fresh. 

I was sent to Subway (which I hate) this was WAY better than a chain deli. It's worth the extra drive!"}
{"text":"Grat little cafe we found on Yelp for lunch when in that part of Phoenix on other business. Excellent lunch choices with well prepared food and a very friendly and appreciative staff.  I had the tuna Melt Special with coleslaw and it was excellent. We ate outside and it was nice since the weather was in the mid 70's. There's not much room inside, so eating outside would be an issue if it was hotter. My only problem was finding the Deli.  It is not obvious from the street and we drove by twice looking for it. It is inside a financial center building just through the front door."}
{"text":"Stopped by here today, and ordered the Italian Hero. It was delicious, as was the homemade pasta salad. Everything was very fresh. They had a huge menu, and a lot of ready-to-go packaged snacks/desserts behind the counter. The staff was super friendly. I will definitely be coming back!"}
