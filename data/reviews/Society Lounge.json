{"text":"I love this place. It's sexy. Great drinks, hottie bartenders and I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"My first time was my last time. 
Decor is nice, ambiance is good, drinks are great, but the service?... Stinks! 
One member of my party waited 20 minutes for his drink. During that time the (very unhappy) waitress came to our party at least 5 times to deliver other drinks and take other orders, and kept saying to him \"they're working on it\". Finally, after the 20 minutes, she says \"I am so sorry, we're out of it. Would you like something else?\" He says, \"Suggest something\". She did and he agreed. After another 15 minutes with no drink, he finally went up to the bar himself. Another couple left after waiting 20 minutes to be served. One lady went to the bar to ask for water, and the bartender was extremely rude -- sarcastically pretending not to hear her, as if to say, 'if water is all you want I can't help you'. I ordered a cranberry juice and got half of a tumbler -- about 4 ounces. 

I will not be going back. For the prices they charge I demand better service."}
{"text":"Best kept secret on east 4th street. Hip spot below grade. Found this place to grab a small bite to eat and drinks before the Cavs game. Drinks were amazing. One of the best old fashions I have had. And the food...this was a tasting experience that my tastebuds were thanking me for. Small plates with flavor a that blew my mind. Oysters with special hot sauce from a dropper. Mushrooms that were simply exquisite. Best of all they have a chefs tasting menu if you sit at the bar. I can't wait to go back. Will definitely be a foodie experience."}
{"text":"Welcome to the days of the speak easy! Great atmosphere and great staff! The Bartista is awesome!"}
{"text":"Shady...if I order maker's mark, don't mix jim beam in my drink as I watch you make it. They take your order then 10 others simultaneously & ask you what you ordered over & over so you wait 20 minutes for a drink. Terrible service, bartenders act as if you are inconveniencing them. Here's a note; don't work at a bar if you can't be somewhat personable & pleasant to customers, just all around rude service. Music was good though."}
{"text":"First time at Society and had a great evening. Brought some friends to celebrate their 10 yr anniversary. I accidentally reserved the VIP room for the wrong weekend but the hostesses were very accommodating and helpful. We still got to have the VIP room (also known as \"The Office\") and they even brought champagne for our group to celebrate. Our server, Jordan, was just the sweetest. We loved her so much. 

The atmosphere is cozy and swanky. There was a live swing band playing, but we didn't really get to hear much in our private room. I ordered The Late Bloomer which is a fresh mix of basil, cucumber, vodka, and champagne if I remember correctly. It was delish, I would order it again. My husbands Old Fashioned was fantastic. One of our friends ordered one of the punch bowls, not sure which one, but it tasted great and they did not skimp on the booze. 

The drink prices are high but they are worth it and you're also paying for the atmosphere. Great stop on our night out and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a gem I stumbled upon accidentally! I very randomly ended up there not knowing anything about the place. It was a bit too dark of an ambiance for me (hence the lights they make available on the menu), but the service was impeccable and the food was *de-li-cious*! first day of the new menu on Tuesday 5/17 and I can't tell you what I liked most but I did have a top 3: The fois gras was one of the best I had (buttery, creamy and flavorful) with an interesting mix of accompaniment, including amazing walnut jam and Spanish vermouth jam! 

The pork charcuterie were so flavorful, and the mushrooms were amazing with the Meyer lemon that I would have never guessed would go so well with it. 

No dessert sadly but the entire experience was so amazing that who cared? Not me. We did liquid desserts instead with the White Russian that was awesome. LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"The Society lounge defines the word \"mixology\"....... All drinks are hand made using fresh juices and syrups.
Great concept , professional service, delicious libations."}
{"text":"Sitting waiting on my drink for 25 minutes now. Waitress said 3 of 5 done. Great...  music is terrible. I appreciate the nostalgia,  however, at least try to parallel modern days. I'm dying to leave.  Will slam my drink so I can go, if I can ever get one."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite bar in Cleveland. It's set up like a traditional speakeasy from the 20's/30's erra. They have a piano and lounge singer that sounds like Frank Sinatra, and various other acts. The drinks are pricey, BUT YOU ARE DEFINITELY GETTING WHAT YOU PAY FOR. It's all world class highly ranked liqour and wine. The staff is AMAZING and super nice. They take care of everyone and quickly. My favorite thing about this place is that there are NO TV's or distractions anywhere. So people actually have to talk to each other and socialize. And it's been great every time I've been there. I HIGHLY recommend this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"This place has really cool drinks and a nice atmosphere, but we had one of the rudest bartenders I have ever encountered (and we've been to some shady bars).  Part of the experience of going to a speakeasy with hand crafted cocktails (that you pay a hefty premium for) is that you expect excellent customer service.  My wife and I came in and I immediately knew what I wanted, but she wanted to talk to the bartender about some options, to which she replied \"I don't have time to talk to you, order a drink\".  We ordered our first drinks and they were quite good.  The next time we caught the attention of the bartender, she said \"order something easy, I'm too tired to make a drink\".  When a place charges $15 for a drink (that I would happily pay for a high quality drink and service), I expect at least a friendly interaction and a willingness to provide the service that I am paying for.  I wanted to like this place, I really did, but unfortunately we will not go back.  Velvet Tango Room it is..."}
{"text":"Couldn't get served. Bartender behind bar literally delayed serving me drinks while many others came to bar!  Won't visit here again!"}
{"text":"This place is Great to visit on a Saturday, live music. Good drink selection and the bartenders make them right. I had a bottle of oak aged LaTrappe for beer week, 
excellent. No trouble makers in there you dont have to worry about drama like a lot of other places. I bring my wife there once a month, we have a good time."}
{"text":"I stopped by when I was in Cleveland on a visit. Have to say, there aren't many bars like this.

You could go anywhere to get a crown and coke, but if you want something different and that's freshly made with real ingredients - then go here. 

The bartenders are all fully trained, and while it may take a minute to get your drink it's WELL worth the wait. They create their own in-house cordials/cocktails all from scratch.

They also have a great tapas menu which is perfect for some pre-dinner cocktails and a few apps to get you started for a night out in CLE."}
{"text":"I walked up to the door one evening with two male friends. It was a pretty dead night in Cleveland and not many people were out. It was fairly early in the night, and the doorman asked if we had a reservation. I replied no, and he explained that there was a wait to enter. I'm willing to bet $50 that the inside was nowhere near, not even close, to capacity. 

The doorman and his West Village NYC vibe was over the top, and so was this supposed wait. I got a bad vibe and will probably never go back. They would have been lucky if I were to spend my money on there overpriced drinks!"}
{"text":"Cool underground place with live music and fun atmosphere. Moscow mule is a must! Drinks are not very affordable here but the quality (may) makes up for it.  I like that they try to be creative and have different events!"}
{"text":"Not a very good place to have a drink solo. Slow service."}
{"text":"Much love and appreciation for this establishment.  Mainly dealt with Lindsay throughout the night but Tia (pretty sure that's her name haha) and Chris made an out of towner feel very welcome.  
Knowledge along with drink preparation was very much on point, and for someone that assistant manages a speakeasy in the Albany, ny area, I left very thankful for experiencing the establishment."}
{"text":"Had wonderful after dinner drinks here.
Moscow Mule was delicious when your drink calls for lime juice you are receiving fresh squeezed lime juice. 
All their employees are very knowledgeable about their drinks and how they make their ingredients. 

Love the decor and theme of true mixology they are bringing back.
I will definitely be back to enjoy more cocktails."}
{"text":"This was a great place to grab drinks! There is a large selection of specialty cocktails. You sit in these loungey-boothy areas with little curtains that simulate privacy/intimacy which if you get drunk enough could totally feel sexy. I got some kind of smokey whiskey drink that had the word blood in the name, but it was great! 
Also a plus is that they have huge ice cubes. Yay for novelty ice cubes. 
We only left this place so soon because we were all anticipating getting drunk munchies at McDonalds and watching TV in my bed but then it was closed. misery bear."}
{"text":"Their drink menu is out of sight. If you somehow don't find what you want out of their dozen or so page menu, then just ask for it. They have skilled bar tenders who know how to go off menu like a champ. 

The area is dark (borderline too dark) and intimate. It was perfect for something different to do on a date night. 

The service was a little slower and less attentive than what I was expecting for the price, but when you could get their attention, they were friendly."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bartenders in the city. The cocktail waitresses are not bad either :). The door guy Adam was one of the friendliest people I have ever met. We will def be back"}
{"text":"Stopped in to this quaint, lively speakesy on a whim with my fianceé while we were in town from Pittsburgh for a getaway weekend. We lucked out having Katherine/Katie as our server, and she did a fantastic job all a round from being attentive, to recommending great tasting drinks for my fianceé. Also, we had the pleasure to meet Joseph while there, and he was kind enough to give us some of his time on a busy Saturday night to chat.  Without question, we will be back next trip."}
{"text":"Fun place to go for drinks. They make very fresh and yummy cocktails. I've not eaten there so I can't comment on the food."}
{"text":"The best place to drink delicious hand crafted cocktails in down town Cleveland, period!"}
{"text":"This place is my go to bar for any downtown activities. If your looking for a jack and coke, go somewhere else, but if you want a delicious and unique drink made with quality ingredients, this is the spot. The atmosphere is relaxed but lively, and you can have a conversation without screaming, (bonus points). The cilantro tequila is fantastic.  The first time I went in I was in shorts and flip flops, a little intimidating, but the people who work there are not the kind to put there nose up. If you havent been, go. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Best Moscow mules ever! The brew their own ginger beer! Cool jazzy atmosphere! Friendly wait staff! Been back many times since the first."}
{"text":"Intriguing menu, albeit small selection. Fantastic drinks. Great service, marvelous atmosphere-sexy and cozy. One drink page even listed drinks from the 19th and early 20th centuries."}
{"text":"After my last visit here, I am off this place.

Came in around midnight on a Wednesday.  Hardly anyone in the bar, maybe one table and three people sitting at the bar.  Our server took our drink order promptly, and then we waited, and waited.  Finally, my drink arrives, but not my boyfriend's.  The server asks him if he wants to order something else because there is some problem with what he ordered.  So he picks something else.  We wait, and wait, and wait.  Nothing.

The waitress comes back and apologizes and says that they are comping my drink.  Ok, but what about my boyfriend?  Could you not at least bring him a simple jack and coke or something?  

We were in this bar for about 35 minutes and they couldn't get my boyfriend a drink.  Any drink.  And there were hardly any other customers!  

If this bar doesn't fail, it will be a miracle."}
{"text":"Very nice establishment! Great energy, eclectic, amazing drinks, welcoming staff members!"}
{"text":"This place has been open for several months but I just finally got to checking it out recently. Loved the lounge setting and classic theme. Phil Turk was singing when I arrived and was providing awesome entertainment. The highlight of my experience was the drink menu. Best Manhattan in Cleveland!!

Service:
Bar was full which would be expected on a Saturday night but bartenders were very approachable and did not rush their craft. 

Dress:
There is no official dress code and people were in everything from classic three piece suits to jean and t shirts. I would say you would never feel over dressed here because it is on the classier side.

Food:
I can not comment since I have yet to try any food here.

Hygiene:
Clean lounge area. Bar area was not sticky or smelly.

Accessibility:
Located on E. 4th so parking downtown is always a hassle but definitely worth the effort.

I will definitely be returning to this place in the future and if it continues to impress me after a few visits I'm bumping this up to 5 stars! I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you haven't yet. I also plan on joining the theme and dressing the part next time I visit."}
{"text":"I am amending last year's review.  This place has become a very welcomed addition to the CLE downtown bar scene.  Happy hour is my favorite time to visit before it gets crazy busy...and this place can get crazy busy!  The quality of drink is top notch."}
{"text":"A great vibe and atmosphere and the drinks were great, albeit a bit on the pricier side. I enjoy a great classically made cocktail,  but $12-$14 is a tad on the high end. Great place for a pre-dinner \"one\" drink."}
{"text":"Great music.  Great atmosphere.  Unique drink selection - enjoyed the Corpse Reviver #2.  Great place to people watch.  If on a date, recommend sitting together on the bench against the wall across from the bar - allows you to be close & hear each other."}
{"text":"We came to society after dinner around 10pm on Saturday night. We were greeted by an extremely personable doorman who proudly explained the vibe of the lounge & how all bitters, syrups, etc are made in house. My fiancée & I were excited to give it a try so in we went...

Once we got downstairs, the place was packed. Pretty much wall to wall people & it took about 20 mins just to get the attention of a bartender. We each ordered an applejack old fashioned & knew it would be a bit of a wait for our drinks given how busy it was as well as the handcrafted element of the bar. What we didn't expect was a 40 minute wait for 2 drinks. We were standing at the bar watching the bartender we had placed our order with continue making other drinks, but not ours. After about 25 mins, my fiancée asked him about our drinks thinking he had forgotten. He got a very short answer of \"a little busy here\" about 10 mins later we finally got our drinks. 

$28 for two old fashioneds, which given the location, as well as the handcrafted aspect seemed about right. What didn't seen quite right were the drinks themselves. We ordered the applejack old fashioned & were both served a traditional. Bit of a bummer since we were looking forward to trying something different but we didn't feel like waiting again. 

There were plenty of empty seats, but they all had reserved signs on them so we stood the whole time. Once we finished our drinks, we left. 

I appreciate the handcrafted quality & the vibe of the lounge but it's almost like they're trying too hard. Their bartenders were working their butts off & still seemed in the weeds. Maybe adding a few more to the staff would help? It's something different for the east 4th crowd, but for us, I don't think we will be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Staff was extremely accommodating! We had a large party just stopping in for a drink and they immediately offered us the private lounge. We had our own waitress so we didn't have to deal with the bar crowd. The piano player was great, until he stared singing. Cocktail list was extensive, so there is something for everyone! Tapas are offered as well. I highly recommend the prosciutto wrapped dates."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here.   Fantastic cocktails, and the bartender (perhaps Leanne?) was incredible.  She clearly has the skills, and was fun to talk to.  And the mushroom plate was so very tasty. I will return on my next visit to Cleveland, for sure."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I (from LA), were in town for a wedding.  As we strolled down the walk-street, we came across Society Lounge and immediately added it to our weekend itinerary.  This place is a \"Must go to when you are in Cleveland\" kind of place.  The drinks were delicious, and prepared with a lot of soul...  I know that sounds corny, but you can just tell when someone takes the time to make a proper drink.  We ordered a couple of classic cocktails and ordered a few specials they had for the day and we were not disappointed.  The service was fantastic, particularly our server Kelsey.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Really chill place. The location is great, right in dwtn near a lot of other bars and restaurants. The vibe is very cool - it's in a basement, low lighting, makes you feel like you stepped into a speakeasy. Our bartender was knowledgeable, efficient and attentive. New fave stop in CLE."}
{"text":"The singer really makes this legit. They have a very broad menu. Like the theme. Service was great. Was down stairs so added to the feeling. It was almost centered around the singer and less on the drinks and company, which at $14 a drink should be the highlight. The server suggested the Pyrus only with whiskey instead of vodka. I used Bullet Rye and was not disappointed. I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Fabulous drinks. Fabulous bartenders. Fabulous atmosphere. The bartenders gave us great recommendations.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I have waited to review Society Lounge for a while now.  My view of it has changed throughout numerous visits.

I dig cocktails. I've spent a lot of time in Chicago lately and have had some really eye-opening experiences at places like The Violet Hour and The Aviary.  I don't want to make a comparison review here but I can't help it.  Actually, I think it's a complement to Society.

So Society Lounge is kind of like a speakeasy.  You find a doorman right inside off of East4th who doesn't do much other than check your ID.  Down a staircase is a dimly lit room with an attractive bar straight ahead.  The room is lined with white pillars and lounge seating. It's a great space.

The cocktail list is extensive.  They are priced $12-14 and are appropriately sized.  There are a lot of well-thought-out creations.  There will be a wait for your cocktail, like there should be, but sometimes the place is clearly understaffed. At this last visit Saturday night I had an Erie Open- a Campari forward gin drink. It was exactly the grapefruity, bitter drink I was craving.

The place often has entertainers.  A young crooner performed classics this Saturday.  He was working hard and it was a lot of fun.

I prefer Society on a quiet night when there is time and space to interact with the bartenders.  It gets packed on the weekends. In my first few visits I wished that guests would be limited like the more \"exclusive feeling\" above mentioned places.  On a few occasions there have been drunk, obnoxious groups shouting for \"mules\" or something.  Come-on doorman.  I don't expect a dresscode a block from the Q but a little filtering would be nice.  The packed house does add to the atmosphere of the performers though.

Society may not be as refined as other cocktail bars but it's really starting to grow on me.  It is tough to beat downtown for a before- or after-dinner drink."}
{"text":"The cocktails here are just amazing. My Corpse Reviver was tasty with top-notch ingredients. The ambiance is like a speakeasy that one descends downstairs into and is taken back in time. The craft cocktails are wonderful and the service is great. I can highly recommend this place as a must-stop when one is downtown and wanting a great cocktail. This is definitely a favorite stop for me."}
{"text":"After an evening at Playhouse Square with some girlfriends, we walked over here on someone's suggestion. I was greeted by a cozy atmosphere that was sort of speakeasy-esque. Vintage meets modern here, where tattooed, blue haired bartenders craft specialty cocktails, and a nerdy guy sings Britney Spears and Journey along with his own piano accompaniment. Very entertaining and made me smile a number of times.

The hostess was on point. She told us there was no table at the moment but she would let us know. After about 20 minutes, we had settled in by a ledge, perching our drinks on what seemed like a faux wooden log, when she approached us and let us know that a table had become available. Nice! I kind of expected her to just forget about us, but she made a point of tending to the guests in addition to maintaining her post at the front.

The drinks were tasty, but not the best ever. However, they were pretty strong, and had a slow-burning effect, if that makes sense. They hit me gradually after awhile, instead of a knockout punch. I liked that.

We tried the charcuterie plate too, which had delicious bread and really standout cheeses. Marcona almonds are my favorite!

At no point during my visit did I think \"I'm too old for this.\" Ages were mixed and so were personalities. There were people in Cavs jerseys stopping by after the game, and people in dress clothes stopping by after the theater. Nobody looked out of place...and everyone looked like they were having a great time."}
{"text":"Shout out to Amanda, our server, who was/is amazing! We had a party of 6 and were lucky to be able to have one whole corner of the bar to ourselves. I love the \"against the rules\" feel of this place as it is in the basement of the building. It feels like we are entering a secret location- I am one for the trend of the Prohibition era bars. 

I appreciate bars that make drinks from scratch. Believe me, I love a good vodka tonic but every once in awhile I love a true authentic French 75 or Manhattan. I love that both bartenders and servers here will let you try different liquors or drink concoctions so that you taste the different flavors in each drink."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Cleveland. The bartenders are true artists. It's mesmerizing to watch them make such fresh, complex drinks so quickly. Drinks are expensive but exquisite. The atmosphere is relaxed and feels like it's out of the 1920's. I love walking down modern E. 4th, then disappearing into this old underground speakeasy. Great place for the first drinks of the evening, or to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"The bartenders were very professional and the drinks were made with intent and precision. If you like a light floral gin cocktail, highly recommend the flower hopper. The bar tenders are very knowledgeable and make good recommendations on drinks. You can tell they put thought into crafting the cocktails as the drinks are balanced and nuanced. They even squeeze the rind of citrus peels over your drink to add a cloud of top notes, not something you typically receive at other Cleveland bars. 

I was hoping that this bar would be a nice place to sit down with a friend for a nice conversation and enjoy some smooth beats in the background. However, the usual ambiance is different from what the name of the bar suggests. I will leave the  comment at that. Just hoping they would enforce more of a dress code to be consistent with their name."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place.  I went in the fall of 2013 and totally forgot until now to give it a review, but I all the sudden had a hankering for their charcuterie board and started fervently searching for it until I found this menu online and realized THIS was the place (I only remembered \"Lounge\" being in the name).  GOOD. GOD.  It was the best charcuterie board I've ever had in my life, and I've had many.  Local honey, marcoma almonds, good cheese, bread, mustard, GREAT meat... Just amazing stuff.  I mean, I'm still thinking about it two years later, so that says something.  This and Lola are must-dos if you're in Cleveland.  I'd fly there just to eat at these two joints."}
{"text":"The CAVS had just lost game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals and we were not in the best mood. However, that all changed when we arrived to the society Lounge.  When we arrived Phil Turk was singing Sinatra and Amanda was our server. We ordered drinks, but because of how busy it was it took longer than usual. Amanda apologized and comped our first round. When we ordered another round she promptly put in our order and returned with glasses of champagne while we waited for our drinks! I thought this kind of customer service is outstanding. Amanda did an amazing job and we all had a really great time because of it. Not to mention that it was her birthday! Thank you Amanda and thank you Society Lounge for a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for a real drink.  The bartenders are very skilled and can make anything. The drinks take a bit longer to make and are pricy, but they are worth it.

It is more upscale, not a Budweiser kinda place.  The seating is comfortable and the room on the dark side - it is downstairs after all.  It gets a bit loud when the place is packed.  

There is a limited appetizer selection.  The cheese plate is delicious."}
{"text":"My fiance and I spent our weekend in Cleveland and he kept telling me he wanted to go here. Arriving, the person told us to go downstairs. I have been to many speakeasy bars in NYC and this had a very similar feeling to it. The cocktails were outstanding. Our waitress Kelsey was very informative and was very attentive to us. The jazz singer was amazing and gave it an old fashion feeling.  Loved the little flashlights on the menu ,I cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Late on a Saturday night is not the best time to grab a last taste at Society. Our drinks were very good and we enjoyed watching our talented bartender lovingly mix them; they were works of art! But we could see nothing of the space because it was quite crowded. The piano player was Sinatra-esque and added a nice feel to the evening, but we want to try again, either earlier or with a reservation, so we can enjoy all that Society has to offer."}
{"text":"If you love old drinks and a dark laid back atmosphere, stop down. Music is kinda lame  depending on who's working. Hence the 4 stars. Otherwise please keep this wonderful establishment going."}
{"text":"As you descend the staircase you are transported to a different time. This classy establishment takes you back to an era filled with jazz and handcrafted cocktails. My boyfriend and I found ourselves here on a whim and cannot wait to go back. 

We looked over the extensive cocktail menu and settled on the Monkey Gland and Boston Sour. Outside of my typical drink choice I couldn't have been happier with the result. The best part of the ordering experience was watching the bartenders create these cocktails. It almost an insult to call them bartenders they are true cocktail artists. 

We found a seat at their piano and enjoyed listening to the Jazz they had performing. The ambient lighting, soulful sounds and delicious drinks made this a must visit."}
{"text":"Great drinks (although I will still give a bigger nod to Velvet Tango Room).  Kinda odd environment.  Can't quite put my finger on it.  Maybe it is the odor of fresh carpet ( weird because it isn't carpeted) but it is super dark in there.  Society feels like it is trying too hard and trying to be something it is not.  If I want a classic cocktail in a comfortable environment, I will head to Velvet Tango every time.  It feels like Society is trying to attract a younger crowd... Which I fear this place will become douchebag central in a few months.  But then again, douchebags probably won't pay $12 for a cocktail...remains to be seen I guess..."}
{"text":"The drinks were awesome, all handmade. We got an old fashion and 4th street sour. We will be back after dinner for post dinner cocktails."}
{"text":"A staple of the Cleveland experience! A fun-filled atmosphere with employees dressed as if they are the characters of Gatsby! I happened to go on the day they were celebrating prohibition repeal day and now I can't wait until I can go back! Plus they have absinthe."}
{"text":"This is the place to get a drink while you wait for a table at Lola's or some other nearby restaurant or to get a nightcap before you head home. Plan to spend a little extra time here as the bar staff takes extreme care to make your drinks memorable.  That means you might place an order at an empty bar and wait 15 minutes to get it. Trust me, it's worth it. We came here twice during our three night stay because we enjoyed it so much.  This night we opted for the fourth Street sour and death in New York.  My friend felt the fourth Street was the best drink she's had in a very long time. Our bartender took extra care with the second one to show her how it was made.  The death in New York was my drink and it was also very good.  They also have an excellent bourbon selection here if that is of interest."}
{"text":"They are the best bar around downtown! 
Whatever drink your heart fancies- they will make it! Especially Joe and Jamie!! They make the best drinks! They have music on the weekends and extremely welcome to those from Cleveland and those visiting!"}
{"text":"Love the environment here. 2nd time here and was even more impressed then the first. They make all their drinks with fresh fruits, which takes time to get your drink, but is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"The place itself is a neat concept - classy lounge furniture, drinks served in fashionable cups and glasses, and young professionals filling the room wall to wall.

The drinks were very pricey.  I'm cheap.  Unless you're using vodka made from the young of a bald eagle, I don't want to pay $11 for a simple mixed drink.  Sorry, that's just the way I am.

What truly made the night extra special for was was ROB - the fantastic piano player.  He needs to play there ALL the time!  :)  The husband and I rarely stay up past 11pm...Rob kept us out till 2am!  It was so much fun for us to sit around the piano table and sing along to fantastic songs.  

Thank you, Rob.  You made our night at Society Lounge."}
{"text":"I'm not your average woman thats a cocktail fanatic (I know, is this real life?) Just get me a glass of red wine and you got yourself a happy lady. But these cocktails are out of this world. Of course, only the best takes time and its no surprise that their concoctions are very well put together and take a few minutes to make. Still, you will not be disappointed with what you have been waiting for your whole life. The ambience in the room makes me feel all types of ways. My favorite night was around Christmas and they had a guy singing to jazz with the piano playing. It's dim, its unique, and its modern. Most importantly its hidden in a basement in one of the most popular streets on E4th. I couldn't recommend a better place if you want to wow a non-Clevelander."}
{"text":"I'm not from Cleveland so I'm not sure how many places serve cocktails like this in town, but I assume it's the only one based on prices and service. Otherwise people would go elsewhere. 

Drinks- we tried 3 and all were very good. However, $15 is steep - even in more expensive places like chicago & Seattle. I have no problem paying $15 for a drink- but I expect good service and atmosphere to go with it.  

Atmosphere - decor and space is nice, nothing super interesting but it's nice. However since there appeared to be only one set of speakers the dj was BLASTING the music at an uncomfortable level. We had to repeatedly yell things to have a conversation while being a foot apart. 

Service. Was. Terrible. So so bad. I stood at the bar for over 10 minutes (no exaggeration) without being even acknowledged. There were 5 people behind the bar and what appeared to be a manger walking throughout the place and it was not crazy busy- steady yes, but not busy. Plenty of space to just walk up the bar and order if someone would bother talking to you. During my time waiting I did get to see the bartenders mess up drinks multiple times and toss them, break glasses, and fight with each other- loudly and obviously. Super professional. 

I'd go back if you're craving a really good cocktail and can't find literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"This was a great place with out of this world drinks until one of the servers tried to get my husband and I to move tables (after we had already been sitting there for a while).. It was 11 PM on January 7th and she tried to claim she would 'make us' move if a party of 4 arrived. Would love to go back, but this lady was extremely rude and ruined the terrific ambiance of this place. I would give it 5 stars for sure if not for this bad experience!!"}
{"text":"We went to Society after a dinner out for a friend's 30th birthday. Holy Hipsters! I had some jackrabbit drink and a Moscow mule. My husband had a coffee cocktail. Seating at tables is reservation only. It was pretty packed the whole time we were there. Our waitress was attentive but it takes a long, long time to get drinks. Their drinks are high quality and come with a high price tag to match. While the drinks were good, I fully admit this place was not my style and I highly doubt I'll ever return. I'm torn on my rating. I'd give it a 3, personally...just because of the hipster factor...but it honestly probably deserves 4 stars."}
{"text":"As much as I appreciate The Velvet Tango Room, I think I would pick the Society Lounge if some crazy, all-powerful person forced me to choose only one Cleveland \"speakeasy\" for my high-end, old-fashioned drinks. (Why would they even bother to do that? I don't know, I said they were crazy.)
Like the Velvet Tango Room, the drinks at this E. 4th establishment are authentic with top-notch ingredients and bartenders that take great pride in their work. But here the prices are lower -- even taking into account having to pay for parking unless you live downtown. We recently stopped in after a Cavs game and I had a Delicious Sour and Jeannene had a French 75 (both $12). My Sour had the necessary sour but it wasn't mouth-puckering and the foam on top from the egg was only slightly more substantial than air. Jeannene's French 75 also showed a deft hand as it wasn't too tart, either.
High Society also has a decent-sized appetizer menu with non-outrageous prices (another plus for them over Velvet Tango Room). We ordered the pistachio-crusted goat cheese medallions ($9) and got three the size of small burgers. The crunch and umami flavor of the nuts went well with the creamy tanginess of the cheese and, if that wasn't enough, drizzled on top of was a mixture of honey and balsamic glaze that had us wiping down the plate with the pieces of baguette that came with it.
Lastly, as much as I dig the atmosphere at Velvet Tango Room, I enjoy High Society's even more. Set in the basement, it is almost all exposed brick and very little lighting, except for around the bar. Your body can't help but start to relax no matter what event or crowded restaurant you just came from.
I wouldn't deal with downtown traffic or pay for parking just to come here but I would definitely add it to the itinerary if I was already planning to be around E. 4th."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting with the most interesting cocktails, swanky ambiance, and top quality entertainment from the expert bartenders! Highly recommend you stop in!!!"}
{"text":"Society is without a doubt my favorite drink spot in Cleveland.  Ive been going there with friends and dates about once a week for the past 3 months.

If there is one reason you go to Society Lounge, its for the drinks.  The cocktails offered on their menu are akin to works of art.  The first time you go, I highly suggest going right up to the bar to order the first round so you can watch the bartenders make your drinks.  It can be pretty impressive to see how much time is put into concocting a single cocktail.  The cocktails are in the $12-14 range and are worth every penny.  Just be mindful, they are not on the light side, most of these cocktails are definitely heavy and can/will hit you hard (e.g. the Sazarac, Widow's Kiss).  Luckily, the menu has a really useful guide/legend at the bottom of each page to categorize the drinks so you know exactly what youre getting, even if you aren't as well-versed in the cocktail lingo.

The atmosphere is perfect for either a fun night out on the town with friends or a quiet and cozy date.  The lounge is entirely underground and has a great ambiance.  The lighting is dim and definitely is ideal for setting the mood.  The decor is very modern and the funiture is perfectly comfy for sitting back and relaxing with your cocktail. The plethora of couches, chairs, stools and benches gives your butt a variety of options, and I am a man who likes his options.  In terms of the attire, its definitely a mix of casual to dressy.  However, I would suggest dressing to impress.

Often, on the weekends, live bands / artists will perform.  Youll see everything from swing bands to vocalists with deep and soulful voices.

The bartenders and servers at Society are always top notch.  Very friendly and always ready to strike up a fun, quick conversation inbetween drink orders when its not too busy.  Keep in mind, that these cocktails take time to make. If the lounge is busy, it definitely takes some time to get your drinks.  Its for that reason that I suggest going in the non-busy hours.

The manager at the bar is a cool guy by the name of Joey. I cant speak higly enough of his service.  A couple weeks ago, I wanted to help my buddy celebrate his birthday in style. I went to Society a day beforehand and talked to Joey about doing something memorable. He came up with the idea of having a special drink on the menu just for my friend.  Beyond that, he went out and bought him a birthday cupcake from Colossal Cupcakes on Euclid, candle and all.  You really cant beat that kind of service.  

Im pretty fortunate that I live on East 4th, so its easy for me to go to society anytime of the week.  If not living nearby, tons of parking is available in the area, including the East 4th valet service.  One of the benefits of being so close to the Q and Progressive Field.  If looking for a dinner option to precede the cocktails on a date, East 4th as a number of nice restaurants.

I cant recommend this lounge enough, go check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere. The service is fast and dedicated. My only recommendation would be less death music...Flossie knows her craft"}
{"text":"If you have been to Velvet Tango Room, Society is it's sibling that lives on E 4th in a sexy basement lounge.  The hand made drinks and service are fantastic.  They also have those extra delicious cherries as garnishes to some of their drinks.  The night I was there they had the Cavs game projected on a brick wall and had live music. For me this is a special event type of place since their crafted drinks are a little steep for my typical night out."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and an awesome atmosphere. The drinks were a bit pricey, but overall a fun experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I had never been here so we decided to grab a drink. We walked in and were seated immediately. The hostess told us she would have a member of the waitstaff with us soon. We waited 15 min. No big deal. The hostess came back to see if anyone had taken our drink order, they hadn't, so she took our drink order and said she would tell a member of the waitstaff. So a member of the waitstaff came to our table to double check our order we had given the hostess. We sat for 45 minutes with nothing. Another member of the waitstaff came to our table to take our drink order, we informed her we had placed one a long time ago and we were still waiting on it. 10 minutes later, no drinks, not even water, and another member of the waitstaff (#4) came to get our order. We informed her she was the 4th person to take our order but we hadn't received anything. The table across from us were seated right before us and finished 2 round of drinks while we were still sitting there. Extremely unorganized waitstaff and absolutely ridiculous that my husband and I waited for over an hour for one cocktail. They weren't even super crowded. I know others have had good experiences with Society Lounge, but I can only speak from our experience and it was horrible. I hope this comes as constructive criticism for the establishment."}
{"text":"This place was just plain awful.  We walked in on a Saturday night around 7 and it was almost deserted.  The decor was drabs seemed dated and dusty.  

The server was so slow in getting us a menu that by the time we glanced it over we were just completely turned off and ended up leaving with out having a drink.  I would not recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Society is the kind of place that leaves you with that warm fuzzy feeling. Due partly to its 'speak easy' vibe, and also the amazingly tasty (and strong) drinks. If you have to chose one drink, you can't go wrong with the East Fourth Sour.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I'm just going to throw this out there....Society might be my new favorite spot on E. 4th. We stopped in late night after dinner for a few cocktails and I was blown away. First of all, I've walked past this place at least one hundred times and I've been curious, but never stopped in. I'm not sure why, but boy, do I regret that now. 
We walked in, went down some stairs, and walked into this dimly lit, romantic little speakeasy lounge. The place has a causal yet still fancy vibe. We grabbed two seats at the bar and looked over their cocktail menu. They pride themselves on well crafted cocktails and had page after page of great sounding ones. I got the main street mule and then some cucumber cocktail (can't remember the name) and both were some of the best cocktails I've had in awhile.
There was live music playing and just overall really good vibes. All the bartenders were friendly, the drinks were on point, and the atmosphere was awesome."}
{"text":"I understand this is a craft beverage place.  I ordered a bottled of wine and left after it did NOT arrive after 30 minutes.  I know you don't have to muttle a bottle of Cab...."}
{"text":"I love a good speakeasy, and after my sorority big sister's wedding, we went here for the after party! It was a long wait for a crafted cocktail, but that comes with the territory of these delightful handmade concoctions. 

My drink had a lot of interesting flavors, but it was shockingly sweet. It had lavender and lemon aromas, both of which I love. Since speakeasies tend to customize drinks as well, I'm sure they would be happy to accommodate the request for a \"less sweet\" option!"}
{"text":"Still a fairly new addition to Cleveland's burgeoning E 4th Street, Society Lounge has likely cemented it's place for the next few years to come.

Sitting on the cusp of a Velvet Tango Room atmosphere, Society Lounge sets itself distinctly apart from every other establishment on the street.

There is always a well dressed, friendly gentleman guarding the door.  From there, you descend into the pit.  The lounge is dark, drowning you in a dusky speakeasy atmosphere.  Jewels and glitter drip off the generally well dressed clientele.

JOE is one of the best of the bartenders, though all are great.  On a busy night, expect to wait for drinks.  They are all handcrafted and take some time, but are certainly worth it.  

There typically is some form of live music at night, which can be a bit hit or miss.  Come here with an hour or two before you head to dinner, or to chill out and cool down after stuffing yourself somewhere like greenhouse.

Worth. It."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I am glad I visited several times prior to reviewing.  I first went when it was new and they were still working on their skills. But the last few visits have been nothing short of spectacular. 

First, I am a huge fan of craft cocktails (and craft beers and wines, I just like yummy liquids,  ok?) If you come here,  keep in mind true craft cocktails made with fresh squeezed juices and muddled herbs take time to prepare properly.  Come here and enjoy the ambiance and your friends. Slow down. No need to be in a hurry. 

My personal favorite is the Mexican Monk made with tequila,  lime,  egg white, and something spicy. There's also an Herbal Smash that's good for those people who like mojitos but want something new. And theres a drink named after what sounds like could be a greek god that is posted on the chalkboard (cannot remember the name).  Its made with OJ and ginger and they made mine with bourbon, because, well bourbon.

If you can't find something you like in the large book of cocktails,  ask your mixologist for a recommendation. They usually can steer you in the right direction. 

The atmosphere is cozy and somewhat romantic or posh, depending on your company that evening.  Couch seating and intimate tables are everywhere. Reservations are wise, but honestly,  I only had one night where it was a close call without. But if you have your heart set, best to be safe than sorry.

Drinks are on the higher price point, but they don't skim on alcohol or quality. This is a place you come to sit, sip, and enjoy your company.  So the experience and quality drinks are well worth it."}
{"text":"Society Lounge has a really cool speak-easy feel to it with excellent decor that makes you feel like you're back in the 1920s. They have a huge selection of drinks with all types of spirits. I'm only giving Society Lounge three stars though because our drinks were pretty expensive ($12-14 each) and while they were ok, I expected them to be better considering the price."}
{"text":"Great little spot in a basement type area.  Drinks are funky and the vibe is great.  They had a 3 piece Brazilian group playing music the night I went.  Nice place for a second or third date, but not a first date as the music is loud.  Comfy seating and great mood lighting."}
{"text":"Crafty cocktails that transports you back In time . Was lucky enough to visit on a Saturday night where the live entertainment was delightful! Prices reasonable considering the artfulness that goes in to crafting each drink.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Nice friendly staff except for the Ass Manager which was working as a bartender ( She was egressive) , food recomendation was great by the staff , they had a nice Quarter band playing good music ....all in all the place is highly recomended."}
{"text":"Drinks were great!! Hostess was the best ever...she worked the room, got us a space and kept things moving...fun night!"}
{"text":"Ding ding ding. Best place in CLE for a fancy mixed drink. This is the bartender service and drink list you wish you were getting from all those other trendy hot spots in town. (Are you paying attention fancy roof top locations!?!) 

Fun. In the basement with a speakeasy feel. They don't give away their drinks and it takes time to get served. (Do yourself a favor and sit or stand at the bar where you can watch expert bartenders work) It's worth it. Fun time. Great location."}
{"text":"Great drinks, great service, and fun bartenders! The drinks were strong and creative, and the bartender even bought our first round of drinks because he forgot about them (the place was slammed on a Friday night so it was totally understandable). Definitely recommend if you're a craft cocktail snob in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Early 20th century speakeasy feel that can be hit-or-miss depending on the clientele and drink orders. This was one of the only bars with space on a weekday night before a concert. Strangely, a little too much space - it was empty save for a few other parties, and the lack of body heat made the place feel drafty and a little lackluster. Luckily, our server was attentive and settled us right in with some drinks and appetizers. 

Of the drinks we ordered, presentation was truly spot on for all three, but unfortunately pictures in the dim lighting don't really do them justice. Our favorite was the Hibiscus Ginger Fizz, reminiscent of a smoothie one might have sipped in an 80's diner. My Jack Rose, for all its ombre beauty, was too whiskey forward and I couldn't discern any pomegranate grenadine. If the drinks hadn't each cost two burritos each, we might have gone for another. 

The food menu is crazy overpriced as well, and my friends paid $6 to get three Deviled Egg halves. My $10 Sweet Potato Hummus platter was good (the toasted bread borders on addictive), yet we all left to go eat burgers and french fries. 

I hover between 3 and 4 stars because I think we came on an off evening, where no live music gave life to the dark corners and the clientele seemed withdrawn and sober. The saving grace of the evening was our trusty server, who withstood our disappointed faces at the food quantity, our requests to split the check, and to do it double speed so we could eat before the concert started. And was generally just a positive person to be around."}
{"text":"One of the best bars in Cleveland - unique & great drinks, great atmosphere. Drinks are expensive."}
{"text":"The drinks are great, the atmosphere is dark yet fun, but I didn't dig on the music choice.  It sounded like someone made a Pandora station called \"Apple Advertisements.\"  It just didn't vibe well with every other element of this joint.  But I think that's a minor complaint.  

Service was fine since it was a slow night, but I suspect the speed of service might suffer a lot during a real busy night.  Even on a slow night, the time it takes to make the drinks ruins the relationship building aspect of a craft cocktail/speakeasy style bar.  There needs to be a balance that allows one to establish him or herself as a regular, forming relationships, while still allowing all the customers to get drinks.  If the craft cocktail process takes so long that the bartender is going full speed the entire shift, those relationships are lost.  Perhaps it needs more staff, or perhaps the ability to multitask drink making and chatting isn't so great here?  I don't know, but that's my only reason for taking off stars.  It all just felt like the drink aspect overtook too much of the bar-going experience.  I'll probably go there a few more times and re-evaluate again at some point."}
{"text":"What can I say about Society?  

I have been there many many times.  The reason?  Simply put, the BEST Cocktails in the city of Cleveland BAR NONE.  They have something for everyone and they do a great job on the menu of describing the drinks so you understand what kind of drink you are ordering.  I can't tell you how important that can be for people who are new to a Craft Cocktail/Speakeasy type of place.

Let's get to the nuts and bolts here:

1.  Everything in this place is FRESH and you won't see any of those heinous soda guns anywhere used to add High Fructose Corn Syrup into your life.

2.  They break down their drink menu by type of spirits which I like. I already discussed but their menu includes a scale for the intensity, whether the drink has a sour/sweet/bitter profile, what type of glass, etc... VERY HELPFUL... 

3.  JOE is an artist.. A true GENIUS that is only now starting to get some recoginition for his talents.  I personally call him \"THE NINJA\".  He is the MAN who brings these cocktails to life.  When it isn't quite as busy (weeknight, early evening) he gives me a straight education and I can just listen to him talk about this subject for hours...

4.  The Vibe here is RIGHTEOUS.  The crowd is quite diverse and you are liable to see any number of generations/races/nationalities in here.. but I very rarely encounter the douchy W 6th crowd that makes me never want to go downtown again.

In summary, Craft Cocktail/Speakeasy joints are what I like the best.  I have traveled around the country and when I do, I look for these kinds of places.  Having said that I can honestly say that SOCIETY's cocktails stack up with the best places I have ever been.  It is a TRUE GEM and anyone who enjoys A REAL COCKTAIL should get over to SOCIETY RIGHT AWAY..."}
{"text":"Took 40 mins to get my check after asking for it. Took 30 mins to get a drink before that. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I was highly disappointed by Society Lounge; primarily because everyone set very high expectations for this place. I came here on a Thursday night and there weren't many people there just a few business type groups. 

I ordered the Death in New York which is described as \"buffalo trace bourbon, lemon juice, turbinado simple syrup, house pomegranate grenadine, lucid absinthe, champagne floater.\" I assumed since bourbon and lemon were at the beginning of the drink description it would have some type of bourbon taste; Nope that was not the case. It tasted like straight up anise, which I am assuming is from the absinthe. I could barely drink a quarter of it because all it tasted like was black licorice with an after taste of metal. My boyfriend had the Brooklyn which was good but nothing to rave about. I also found it very bizarre that the server never asked how my drink was, considering I barely drank any of it. 

To eat we really wanted the charcuterie or cheese plates but they were out of many things that go with the platter which I also found bizarre. We got their deviled eggs which also did not taste right. They tasted like eggs with just straight yellow mustard.

I really wanted to like this place because they were highly recommended but I was sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a 'craft cocktail' in route to see Coldplay at the Q....it was our first time here and we were impressed instantly by the dark, yet sophisticated decor.  We ordered a Pink Lady and a Chargarita.  Both cocktails were delicious, but the Chargarita is by far the most creative craft cocktail I've had: from the preparation, presentation, to the unique flavor - just incredible.  I would point out however, this is a CRAFT cocktail lounge, not a draft beer for the masses type of spot.  To best enjoy yourself, get that straight and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here last night for the fist time and it was POPPIN! If you get a chance-- sit at the bar because the bartenders put on a great show! I WISH I was as coordinated in real life as the bar tenders are and could easily do all of the cool little tricks they do!! Lol 

The menu is also super intriguing. Super interesting ingredients all melded together to create a truly unique cocktail that makes your taste buds dance. I ordered the Absinthe drink which was pretty good. I feel like it would have been better without the crushed ice (kept getting stuck in the paper straw) but whatever! It was still really good. I tried a sip of my friends Mai Thai which was good as well. Very cool place and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place. They have the most wonderful staff who are knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. The drinks are amazing and I love trying their new cocktails. Thanks to Misty for her Centerfold which is my new favorite"}
{"text":"I was in town from California to watch a Browns game. I know what you're thinking but that's the truth I swear. Anyways on Saturday after attending the watch party for the Indians at the stadium we stopped in. This is our 2nd trip to Cleveland and 2nd trip to Society. When we walked in the bartenders were immediately attentive flagging us down to get us drinks. When the experience starts like that it really makes the whole evening. We ordered (2) Old Fashioneds and they were probably the best I've had! The credit for those drinks goes to Ben T. and he was also dealing with throwing an idiot out. (He was way more patient than I would have been) They had a great singer who really fit the era and was getting into his music as well. Overall start to finish it was a fantastic experience. Even though I'm only in town once a year for what it's worth I'll be back. Keep up the phenomenal work. So many places today have lost what service is. I applaud you and the staff for keeping it alive."}
{"text":"A must stop - downstairs a bar that mixes some
tasty beverages and live entertainment that is fun with a classy attractive crowd"}
{"text":"Why do the fist pumping, affliction wearing, fireball shooting bros seek out the trendy cocktail lounges in an effort to ruin it for the rest of us? Despite the guy next to me at the bar who continuously tried ordering drinks like buttery nipples (and in effect being shot down because, as the bartender patiently explained to him, they do not carry artificially sweetened spirits), we were able to enjoy the cool vibe and well blended cocktails at society lounge. The drink list, filled with classic concoctions as well as newly crafted cocktails is thorough and interesting. Unfortunately the bar falls short at accomplishing the hip lounge feel it's trying so hard to execute. Maybe it's the lack of savory cocktails?  Maybe it's the lack of rules that other similar bars employ (no cell phones, pull out chairs for ladies, etc) or maybe it's simply accomplishing something else entirely different. The drinks are ok, though priced a bit high for the quality."}
{"text":"Between Madison and Misty you can never go wrong. The ladies craft the most amazing cocktails ever. Sure it gets packed to the hilt on the weekends but then thats most places. I primarily have been here on the weekdays (does that make me sound like an alcoholic?) and I can say that the service is second to none. Its just nice to walk into a bar and to be able to order a Brooklyn and the bar tender knows what it is and isnt out of Picon Amer. 

They do have all the high brow bourbons like Pappy and what not (too rich for my blood) and a good selection of single malts. More importantly they know their drinks. They dont pour you a single malt and drown it in ice.. well maybe if you asked them to but why the heck would you ? I digress... So to get back to the point, do yourself a favor, stop by and indulge in the craft of making drinks. Cheers !"}
{"text":"Too fun!  Reasonable prices,  fun atmosphere.  Good music.  I just felt special. The staff is really knowledgeable about the drinks and really goes overboard to help patrons.  I never liked gin but now I understand what I do and don't like and will order again!"}
{"text":"Awesome drinks, worth the wait.

We came here for An American Marketing Event downtown. We even had to enter with the password provided. The event itself was great and the bar has a really cool setup. The decor and atmosphere are perfect for the speak easy theme. They had some great signature drinks but I went with the classics; Old Fashioned's and Moscow Mules. 

They were good! Like really good. It did take a while for them to make the drinks. Yes I factored the crowd into it too. They just seemed to really take their time and I am ok with that. The quality was more important to me anyway. 

I will probabaly be back, most likelt after a great meal at Lola's!"}
{"text":"I like this place....  underground on the fun street of downtown Cleveland.    

Drinks are made with passion and care.  The bartenders and staff all seemed very nice and took their jobs seriously.  While the drinks were a bit on the expensive side, they are worth it.

The place is clean, washrooms were fine.  

The only thing we didn't like was the lounge singer who was performing when we first arrived.  Thankfully, he only  lasted another 15 minutes and was off the stage.  

Would definitely come back and would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"This is a great little dark, speakeasy place with good mixology.  I didnt eat here, just had drinks at the bar... nice bar tenders and service as well."}
{"text":"Different vibe .. But that's a good thing! It's a break from your normal downtown Cleveland scene. Moscow mule is good and the wrapped dates are good! So far that's all I've experienced but will definitely be back to try more! 

The place is not that big so it doesn't take much to fill up..be mindful of that if you're coming with a larger group. 

If you're in the mood for some specialty drinks and foods in a non-traditional Cleveland atmosphere Society Lounge is your place!"}
{"text":"Meh, not bad but not great. Not up to the mixology standards of larger cities. Would drop in if we were nearby, but the prices are excessive for the creativity."}
{"text":"Great cocktail bar.  Neat entrance, and down in the basement of an old building.  Nice selection of liquors, and wide variety of cocktails on the menu.  I went on a Wednesday night, while in from out of town.  Had only one cocktail, but would definitely be a great spot if I lived in the area.  Nice joint.  Keep up the great hipster work."}
{"text":"The mark of a great business is often not about how they do when things go well, but rather how they do when something is horribly, horribly wrong.  In my multiple trips to Society, I've seen socializing, visually and taste-appealing drinks, and crafty bartenders assembling crazy libations. 

Most recently, our group of four ventured downstairs to get some post-dinner drinks.  Three people loved their drinks, and one was severely disappointed.  (Me.)  I ordered an absinthe drink.  I understand the aversion that some people have to black licorice / anise flavoring.  I actually think some of those people are just being dramatic. I like the taste.  However, the absinthe drink I received gave me an idea of what those people were talking about.  This drink was overly unbalanced, and just a one note anise bomb.  

Upon noticing that I wasn't drinking nearly fast enough and not enjoying it, our server came over and checked in on me.  I described what was going on, and tallied it up to just choosing the wrong drink.  Well, she made it right.  The drink came off our bill, and I was able to get something else on the menu. 

Society isn't about just serving drinks - It's about you enjoying yourself, treating the alcohol well by displaying it properly, and savoring it.  The care they put into what they do truly makes this a craft cocktail location.  I'll gladly come back to see what else is up their sleeves... but maybe shy away from the absinthe for a visit or two..."}
{"text":"Visited from out of town and it was a great experience. Our server, Kate suggested some places to get brunch the next day and could not have been more helpful. She also brought us a little celebratory cocktail on the house. 

Some dude was singing live music. He sang mostly blues and killed it. 

Good vibes. Great drink selection. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends after looking for my sister's wedding gown. The cocktails are really nice and so is the environment. Nice lounge feel that was warm and inviting. The only thing that was a little annoying is the long wait for drinks. It took about 15 minutes to get drinks after we ordered them.  The GM and all our servers were really great! Super helpful and friendly. I enjoyed my evening and will be back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place with mighty strong drinks! Came here on a Saturday night around 11pm. The place was lively but not crowded- most of the couch seating was taken though. The vibe is sexy and silky smooth. Lots of 1920's decor, red velvet couches, suited up bartenders. There was a live jazz band which really set the mood of the place. We ordered a French 75, Cucumber gimlet and Death in New York. French 75 tasted sweet and bubbly- not too strong. The cucumber gimlet was our favorite- bright, clean and refreshing but still packed a punch with the alcohol. Loved this place and will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"This place is so me. I was so thrilled to discover this place when visiting my parents. They care deeply about their craft here, and it shows. They make complex drinks in a very approachable way. The staff are knowledgable and able to recommend drinks for picky drinkers. We had quite a handful of cocktails here, and all were excellent. The place had a real buzz -- the kind that only comes from a happy clientele. A lounge singer provided some not-too-intrusive entertainment that fit the scene. Highly recommended for a drink before or after a show or dinner nearby."}
{"text":"Society Lounge is a welcome addition to East Fourth and fills the role of a dedicated cocktail establishment quite nicely.  Service was friendly and attentive.  The environment does take some getting used to, but the drinks were all well-crafted and top notch.

My own visit was for after work drinks--not too long after the lounge opened at 5pm.  The space was empty except for one table, but I was first struck by how overwhelmingly dark the room was.  How did people in the 1920's read drink menus without the light from iPhone screens?  Screw it; I put the menu down.  \"I'll have an Amaretto Sour (with egg whites),\" (somehow communicating the parentheses).  This is my favorite drink at Velvet Tango Room, and one I've started making for myself and instructing on how to make to anybody behind a bar willing to listen.  After a minute or two, the bartender came to the table and explained that they didn't have amaretto but could put something together using their house-made almond syrup.  The end result was pretty good:  I still think it would have been better with amaretto, but he absolutely nailed the rich, frothy top that makes the cocktail memorable.

When it was time to order drink #2, my eyes were more attuned to the darkness and Kelly (our fantastic server) happily assisted me in navigating through the menu to something I might like--a Blood and Sand.  As awful sounding as that title may be, it was an excellent drink--one of the best I've had in recent memory--and had some added flair from the perfectly spherical ball of ice inside and the orange zest flamed as it was being served.  

After that, more customers started to file in, and the lounge singer started to do her thing with the piano player playing along.  Drinks #3 and #4 were wholly omakase (\"One drink, please!\"):  A refreshing Cucumber Gimlet and a Kentucky Mule served in a copper mug and copper straw.  Both were very good, and fit the pace and moment just right.

And as I sat there wondering why the metal straw market hadn't taken off, it was time to go and find something to eat.

* Comparisons to Velvet Tango Room are inevitable.  The location of Society Lounge is substantially more convenient for downtown activities, and I get the sense that Society Lounge is more focused on mixology whereas VTR has a full stable of well-made (and well-described) cocktails.  In any event, it takes more than one visit to reach those heights.  I'd be interested in the future to see (a) how far this mixology can go, and (b) how Society Lounge handles big crowds."}

Ambiance =  Eh, so here is my beef.  If I were a new bar in this location, with this feel, I would remove the doorman/red carpet/velvet rope out on East 4th.  This bar has mixologists, hand crafted drinks, and a speakeasy-ish feel.  The love for this place should be spreading by word of mouth instead of by \"marketing\" out on the street.  I honestly didn't go in the other night with friends because the red carpet, velvet rope and doorman really threw them.  Would suggest changing that aspect, to make it a \"where is this place,\" and \"for those in the know\" atmosphere - but everything once you're inside is wonderful! 

Great for after dinner - fancy night at Lola/Chinato/Greenhouse/Pura Vida - drinks!"}
{"text":"So before I get into, I have a confession to make: I like a little bougie here and there...and for Cleveland, this place is bougie!

Drinks are pricey-yes, but it's obvious how much detail goes into crafting these delicious cocktails. I mean, it took me 30 min to order and another 20 min to get my drink. Did I mention I don't mind a little bougie?

This place isn't for everyone, I will admit. It's not your local tavern. It has class written all over it. I know they even have some themed nights. Came here for a flapper theme and they had live music and dancers! It was great and right up my alley!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a huge fan of live music and cigars and I love Brazilian guitar. He had never been before and there was a Brazilian guitarist playing so I thought it was the perfect time to treat him to a night out. I love the vibe here! You feel like you take a step back in time when you enter this modern day speakeasy. It is dimly light with candles lit everywhere. I especially love the candles around the piano. While it is on the smaller side there is plenty of seating available and every time I've gone the service has been good. 

There are limited food options so I would eat prior to arriving or as a stop prior to your meal. The drink list is extensive and a bit pricey but you definitely get what you pay for because the drinks are top notch. I'm not a fan of fruity drinks but also don't want to feel like I'm downing rubbing alcohol either so my server suggested the Vieux Carre which she stated was well-balanced and she was right. The drink is a combination of Rye Whisky, Hennessy and bitters. While it was boozy the bitters definitely balanced it out and took the edge off. My boyfriend had the Old Fashioned with Maker's Mark and enjoyed those as well. 

My boyfriend likes to have a cigar every now and then which is another reason why I chose Society Lounge for date night. I'm not too well-versed in the cigar world but he said that their selection was fairly good. I don't remember what cigar he went with though. The only downfall is that you can't smoke inside so in order to enjoy your cigar you have to go outside. They don't really have a patio area either so you just kind of have to stand around and smoke. Plus you miss out on the music and I'm not sure if you can take your drinks out there with you. 

I highly recommend this as a nice spot for date night but if you're on a budget like me only expect to have a drink or two. We're planning to go back soon to hear a jazz or blues band."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great drink menu with very competitive prices for what they are offering (upscale). The staff was very friendly. They were very willing to explain the drinks on the menu that I didn't already know. This place is a must attend if you spend an evening on East 4th street."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting a friend and they said they had to take me to Society. I loved the vibe at this place. I felt like I was at at 1920s speakeasy! 

The music was great- live jazz just also a DJ in between sets. The drinks where good. I have traveled all over the U.S. and everyone is doing prohibition cocktails and this place does them pretty good. I would recommend the Pisco Sour and the Jungle Bird."}
{"text":"My introduction to this jazzy bar was through local Cleveland residents. Being new to this area, I relied on the locals to decide my Saturday night ventures. Situated in the hub of activity on 4th street this place is your poison if you are looking for a classy, upscale, sophisticated venue for your evening. 

The ambience of this place screams romance. The dim lights, live jazz music comfy lounge chairs all set the mood for a romantic evening. 

What seals the deal: the amazing signature drinks and the efficient staff. I tried the Moscow mule, agave herb smash, 4th street sour and a drink with egg whites(can't remember the name).... In a word...all were delicious!!! The Moscow mule was my personal favorite of the four I tried. 

Lost society was definitely the best way to kick start my adventures at the CLE!"}
{"text":"AWEFUL SERVICE - Stay Away: Bartenders were more concerned in giving free drinks to their friends over paying patrons. Hopefully this place will be bought out or get new management."}
{"text":"We love this place! The Dickens is the best drink ever!  Throwback music and throwback drinks- nothing better!  Speakeasy feel. Will
Come back
Time and time again!"}
{"text":"GREAT bar!!!!  It's very upscale and isn't cheap, but it's worth every scent.  I usually get Maker's straight up, but they make all of their own mixers fresh and after trying a friends Moscow Mule, they are amazing.  The atmosphere is perfect, as it feels like I'm at an upscale ultralounge in Vegas.  Come here whenever you can, it's downtown's version of the Velvet Tango Room."}
{"text":"Really love this place! It's such a cool swanky little bar to grab drinks before or after dinner! Takes some time to get your drinks but that's because their all craft made delicious cocktails. 
They have a little private room which is nice if you have a larger party... we drank in there for my birthday comfortably fits around 12 but we we're able to fit around 16. 
On the weekends they have jazzy like live music which completes the vibe. 
For my husband the best part of society lounge is they serve Pappy Van Winkle"}
{"text":"This is a great place for some craft cocktails. There was a dj playing while we were there, which for me, made it feel a little too clubby. Otherwise, I loved this place. Ben, our bartender, chatted and entertained us the entire time with his quick wit. Order the El Chappo. Delicious!"}
{"text":"A very cool (metaphorically but also literally, in the summer heat) speak-easy type of place. The treat is the craftsmanship of the bartenders, particularly Ben. As a Kentuckian and bourbon fan, I am no rookie to a good pour. Ben is a Craftsman of the old school sense, who convinced a \"bourbon neat\" guy to try and enjoy some excellent cocktails - an Old Fashioned, and Manhattan, and a \"Sullivan & Cromwell,\" his own creation. Watching the process was as enjoyable as the cocktails. Serious professionalism, seriously good cocktails."}
{"text":"I love cocktail lounges. I want to pay $15-20 for a great cocktail. I wish I could do that at Society on E4th. 

I have had a number of unpleasant experiences here in the last 6 months. It is a bad combination of a) poor service/attitudes, b) high prices, and c) not that special of a cocktail. Stopped in for a post Cavs game drink, and was underwhelmed. The service last night left much to be desired, and time after time of experiencing similarly bad service led me here to say something today. 

I know the drinks usually take a while so I hedged and ordered a bourbon neat for my client (never keep them waiting) and a few cocktails for myself/colleagues. Stood at the bar for 20 minutes between receiving the client's bourbon neat and waiting for the cocktails. I then said something/inquired about the missing cocktails and received nasty looks and curt comments from the bartenders (only 2 working on an Eastern Conf finals night), who had what is becoming their normal, generally unhappy look while \"crafting\" $17 cocktails. A simple apology and \"can we cover the drink\" or \"next one is on us\" would have been nice. To top it all off, the door man would not let my additional colleagues in b/c they were \"closed\" at midnight, despite the bar having 25 customers still present/ordering drinks. 

This follows my last time there, when I ordered a Penicillin, which the bar tender made with JW Black. I explained to him that the defining feature of a Penicillin is the Islay scotch floater, which he failed to include. As the top cocktail spot in Cleveland (which they claim to be) you would have thought a) they would be aware of this and b) they happily would have poured a quarter ounce of Laphroaig on top of the $16 worth of JW Black they squeezed some lemon and honey in and called a Penicillin."}
{"text":"My favorite craft cocktail lounge in the city. Super cool atmosphere and their drinks are delicious and well balanced. Their absinthe is really great too. Definitely a must see! Perfect location on East 4th street."}
{"text":"If you're looking for nice cocktails in a lounge setting, then this is your place! It almost reminds me of Velvet Tango Room, but on East 4th. The drinks are pricey but man, are they delicious!"}
{"text":"A sleek speak easy on E 4th.  Perfect addition to this ultra chic area.  It's one my favorite places to go with out of towners or when I want to have a celebratory night out in cle.  Dinner at Lola and drinks at society lounge make any evening feel like a special occasion.  The drinks at society lounge take a long time to prepare, I waited about twenty minutes to get the bartenders attention and another twenty for the french 75 but it was a piece of art with the curly cue rind and the drink was so refreshing.  Be prepared to be transported to another era when you step into this place.  The drinks are thoughtfully made and their prices reflect that, its about 11-15$ a drink.  The atmosphere here is elegant also with a large central bar and lots of tufted arm chairs around the room.  I'll probably only come out here for birthdays or other events but its a good way to make an evening more memorable."}
{"text":"I am a traditional Velvet Tango Room fan. This is the only place in town that holds a candle to VTR in the custom cocktail biz. 

I find the atmosphere to be a little more comfortable and less stuffy than VTR. I went after an Indians game and was severely under-dressed. I didn't feel judged. I sat at one of their comfy tables and was immediately asked what drink I would like.

I have only ever had the maple old fashioned which is one of the best drinks I have ever had in the Cleveland area. I would strongly suggest it if you're into bourbon and you go there to order that.

This place is absolutely worthy of your pricey cocktail dollar. The maple infused old fashioned will run you about 14 bucks. It is a great night cap to any one of the fantastic dining options that you have on East 4th."}
{"text":"Cool lounge. NO LIVE MUSIC in fact bad techno. Bartender had me pay for drinks before she provided them. This did not work as someone else made one of the drinks and another bartender tried to charge me for them. If your into fancy drinks you may like it."}
{"text":"impressive cocktails + sophisticated atmosphere. rather quiet on weekdays, tho"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to enjoy a night out in Cleveland. I'll preface this by saying that I'm a beer girl - craft beer, lite beer, college student beer, I don't discriminate and I choose to come here for cocktails instead because they are that good! Society Lounge is not a place for beer; it is a place for cocktails. Strong cocktails, girly cocktails, unique cocktails - all delicious cocktails. Dont be surprised when you ask for a miller lite and get an annoyed look from the bartender. It isn't because the place is stuck up, it's because they love their trade and want to share their specialties with you!

The menu is separated by apertifs, classics, originals, digestifs, and shareables. If you know what you like in a drink, each menu item has symbols next to it to reflect strength, taste (bitter, sweet, balanced etc), type of ice, and type of glass. If this all sounds too complicated and you just want a damn drink already (!), tell the bartender or server what type of liquor and/or cocktails that you usually enjoy and get their recommendation - I've never been lead astray.

My go-to drink is the cucumber gimlet. I don't think it's even on the menu anymore and the bartenders still happily make it for me. Muddled cucumber, gin, simple syrup, lime juice, oh my! It's refreshing and balanced and is exactly what you will want after a long day of work...and I love gin. I don't think I've ever come to Society and NOT gotten this drink, I buy it for my friends who normally drink gin or vodka tonics, I dream about this drink. My point is - try it!!

I like all of their gin drinks if I'm honest, but on to the whiskey and bourbon. A whiskey sour with egg whites is a nice classic - the egg whites just make it frothy and somehow the perfect texture for the flavor. They do a nice classic manhattan and old fashioned, but if looking for something a little different the \"maple old fashioned\" has maple syrup and a cinnamon and orange flavor and the \"hamhattan\" has pork infused bourbon and mustard bitters - yum! I've recently been ordering the \"smoke & blood\" which is a little on the sweeter side with cherry an orange flavors along with your whiskey, just a nice smooth drink.

The champagne drinks are good if the evening calls for champagne. I am told the Moscow mule is the best in the city. The coffee drinks are also delightful. There's truly something for everyone on the menu.

Atmosphere is great, not too loud for date night drinks earlier in the evening but a little louder after 10pm. Live music on Friday and Saturday nights. The bartenders and servers are always on point and the manager is usually there on weekend nights as well. They all want to make the place succeed and it shows. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Feels like you are stepping back in time when you enter this establishment.
Funky vibes, cool people, awesome drinks. 
I can not wait to make it back and try every drink on the menu.
I hear they have great live jazz music unfortunately we must have been a little early on a Saturday night and there was no band. Hopefully next time we get to enjoy some live music with our cocktails!"}
{"text":"To start, I'm not sure why I ever have this place anything below a 5 (I must have been a little bit hangry, since they only have a limited apps menu). We come here on a regular basis on the weekends to enjoy our two favorite drinks: the Hamhattan (*cured pork belly infused bourbon involved here) and the 4th St Sour (*rosemary infused vodka). Both are Society originals so good luck finding it anywhere else. The vibe of this place is also super sleek (Imagine Boardwalk Empire, but just with people of today instead of the 1920s). Often, the live entertainment is a jazz artist or crooner, which adds to the speakeasy environment. When we have out of town guests (anyone not living in downtown cle), we talk everyone into at least one drink at Society (the downside of the drinks is that they are expensive). Society would be best for a date night or a small, intimate gathering of friends. Large groups would not work well in this place, unless you reserve the party room. And ladies and gents, this is not the place to bring a rowdy group of bachelors or bachelorettes so please save those shenanigans for West 6th Street."}
{"text":"I love this little hidden gem on East 4th Street.  The atmosphere is great. It has a retro, 50s vibe and the drinks match that feel! It has a very upscale, ritzy feel - but in a good way.

It is definitely pricey and the drinks take awhile to come out, but I think it's worth the wait. The menu has TONS of unique drinks to pick from. I love the French 75 and the good ol' fashion, Moscow Mule.  

There is usually a singer performing and he has a Frank Sinatra persona, which is cool. 

The wait staff is always super friendly.  The last time we were there, I made a last minute reservation and they were very accommodating. Our drinks also took a REALLY long time to come out so she gave us a discount, which was very nice of her,

I think everyone needs to try this place at least once!"}
{"text":"I made reservations for 6 to celebrate my birthday. The menu was on point and the cocktails were great. Some of my friends ordered food which was delicious and reasonably priced. However, service was so SLOW  I am a reasonable person and understand we were there on a Saturday night but waiting 25-30mins AFTER placing an order? It just seemed a bit much. Our server was friendly so it's no reflection on her...

On a completely different note they had live entertainment. A singer and a pianist playing anything from classic rock to pop to r&b. The woman singing didn't have a horrible voice but the volume was way to loud and not only that but the speakers sounded like they had blown 3 years ago. I couldn't speak to anyone without repeating myself at least 2x. 

My advice? Ditch the singer and keep the piano player. If I'm going out with my friends or on a date.... Or even if I was single and trying to mingle I would like to be able to hear what someone is saying to me."}
{"text":"I went to Society lounge for the first time before game six of the World Series. I have to admit that I am a little turned off by this location only because of the lack of food.  They do serve the equivalent to small plates, but they are exactly that, very very very small plates. I'm talking about one scallop. The only main reason I do not like this, is when you are serving strong old fashion drinks, it would be very nice to have something in your stomach while you drink. I do have to say though, the drinks were fantastic. A little high in price, but very in line with what I have seen in other areas. I will be a customer for drinks, but never again for food."}
{"text":"A group of 4 of us came here on a Friday night. Everywhere on East 4th was busy. We weren't expecting to find a table or seat at the bar, but to our surprise they had open tables and promptly sat us at one. Our server took 15 minutes to greet us with menus, then another 10 to come back and take our order. Our drinks took another 15 minutes. We really appreciate a great cocktail and are patient and understanding that they can take some time to make, especially when made correctly, but we all got old fashions. When they delivered our drinks, they tasted very watered down like they had been sitting at the service bar for a while. Mine had no orange, cherry, or bitters taste to it- it simply tasted like watered down bourbon over ice :( the atmosphere is really nice, and the staff was friendly. I like how they deliver the check in a cigar box. Our old fashions were $15 a piece and worth $5 I'd say. Definitely disappointed in our drinks and the time it took but it's a nice intimate underground speakeasy style place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The drinks are like a work of art. Leanne crafts some incredible beverages"}
{"text":"Love the vibe here. Went here for a date, the first cocktail I had was the Pimms Cup, I finished pretty quickly, so the bartender was like okay, I'm making the next one. It was a drink with pink peppercorn and vodka. The aromatics were enticing. Love this place, good service for drinks, went on a Tuesday night, when everyone thought it was going to snow storm, so the crowd was minimal, which I liked because I got that individual attention. I am hard to please, so this place is amazing to me, I have no qualms!"}
{"text":"Oh, I love this place especially on quiet Thursday nights. The place has a jazz age atmosphere, dim lights and unique cocktails. As I said I like the lounge on Thursdays because it's less crowded comparing to Friday or Saturday. However, on the weekends, they usually have live entertainment and piano player  
Also, the bartenders are helpful and are flexible to make changes to set cocktails- I usually ask to be easy on alcohol  
Check this out!"}
{"text":"Visited for Repeal Day and this is my first time here. Very busy place. Huge drink menu, live music, and a packed place. Prohibition-era drinks and modern hand-crafted drinks that they have created make up the menu. The bartenders are true artists and a lot of fun to watch when you sit at the bar. Our bartender was making five drinks at once and keeping them all straight. I don't know how he did it! If you're in a hurry, it's not the place to come to as it will take awhile to get a drink, but it's worth it. I had the the hibiscus gin fizz...excellent choice for a fun drink that has a nice taste and wasn't too over powering. Be wary... the drinks are over priced...2 drinks equaled $26."}
{"text":"Good spot but why do they come up in the cigar lounge search or category when they don't allow you to smoke. We were trying to plan a private event to include a cigar moment and were told no cigars due to \"ventilation in their historic building.\" No sticks."}
{"text":"What a great little funky place on 4th Street.   Oddly,  my husband and I were both carded at the door, and we are both senior citizens.  We thought the guy was joking, but it was for real.

We had stopped before Lady Gaga just to have drinks, and it has a very nice atmosphere.   Long bar with seating, and then tables and chairs everywhere.   There was a large piano so I am guessing later at night there would be music.

The drink menu is extensive and all the drinks are made fresh.  Unfortunately for me, most of the drinks were made with whiskey or bourbon or rye and I don't care for any of them.   We both settled for a glass of Malbec which wasn't a great choice.   It was fun to watch the bartenders making all the fancy drinks.  If you are adventurous with drinks, this would be a nice stop."}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience all around. Great vibe. Super knowledgeable staff with a very good selection of spirits. The chef was gracious and hospitable. After ordering some tapas it turned out he was real talent as well. Food was superb. The riff on the hot-n-sour soup was heartbreaking knowing I would not get to eat this again. Don't miss this gem."}
{"text":"I find it perplexing to review this establishment. On the one hand, the drink list is exceptional. Tons of variety, lots of great experimental drink options and a flair for ingenuity. We found the drinks interesting and super fitting for the atmosphere. Service was a little slow but when drinks are so handcrafted it's understandable that it takes more than a few minutes. They're not just mixing a standard gin and tonic, it's got some real precision to it. And the ice! The ice is hand crushed. I'd like to say I can see myself doing that at home but I totally do not see myself doing that at home. 

That's the one hand.

On the other hand, we made the disappointing decision to order food here. We weren't super hungry and thought a few small plates would be enough to fill us up for the night. I can't begin to say how many things are wrong with the food here because, EVERYTHING is wrong with the food here. Our server kept referencing \"chef,\" as in \"let me see what chef recommends\" and \"I'm sorry your octopus is inedible, let me talk to chef.\" Is chef a real person?

Here's a list of the things we found inexcusably wrong on the tapas menu: 
- Cucumber salad: about 9 small slices of cucumber with some marcona almonds, four blackberries and some lemon zest; that's about a dollar a slice; but the portion wasn't the problem, it just wasn't interesting. Best dish of the five we tasted though.
- Eggplant: I cannot describe, in words, how weird this dish tasted. I also could not actively identify any real eggplant on the plate but I did identify plenty of mayonnaise. They should call the dish mayonnaise. 
- Poached cod: This where I nearly lost my appetite. The fish was so obscenely overcooked! I mean, it tasted almost like dried cod. You could see how dry it was even in the darkened light of the room, but it was the horrible stench of fish that really did me in. It was painful. Didn't eat.
- Grilled octopus: OMG. At this point I thought we were on candid camera or something, because this dish was ABSURD. The octopus was so hard you'd have thought it was one of those fake food dishes you sometimes see in the window of Japanese restaurants to lure you in. We couldn't even cut it with a fork and knife. Also, it was ice cold (perhaps that's how they serve it? Don't know). Didn't eat, because we couldn't slice it.
- Cheese plate: more marcona almonds and berries, and some very stale bread to match the seemingly stale cheese. Hard to mess up cheese, but I hate to say that at least we ate it.

I don't know who \"chef\" is but the food here is beyond repair. We ended up at a second dinner nearby in a real restaurant with real food. The tapas experience at this place feels completely out of touch. 

Stick to the drinks menu, seriously. I cannot even imagine what's going on in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Finally made it here tonight for the first time. This place is absolutely perfect. It's exactly what it's supposed to be (minus the red carpet and velvet rope. I agree with Kim S, that's a turn off.) The drinks are hand crafted, reasonably priced for how good they are, and the bar keeps are all very well trained and very knowledgable about what they are making, and why. Overall I'm am extremely impressed and will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here around 11pm on a pretty busy Saturday night. The area by the bar was busy but there was plenty of space otherwise as long as you didn't need a drink. 

The drink menu is extensive. There really are a lot of options. I tried their cucumber gin drink, really pretty (served with a cucumber peel) and good too! But $14?? 

This is a cool and classy place. The drinks are good but it's just too expensive for regular visits. The service definitely lacks. I'm not sure of its because of how fancy their drinks are or the bartenders themselves but I was not impressed."}
{"text":"I've only ever sipped on the cocktails here, so this is solely a review based on their booze, the service, and the atmosphere.

I've been 2x. One time, LOVED IT. The next time, EEEEEK!

The first time was on a weekday night. On a date, my boyfriend and I ended up at Society Lounge. We go down some stairs and enter this super dark, almost romantically vibed lounge, with great jazz playing live and tables and swanky furniture everywhere you look. 

You go here for the atmosphere. You go here for the drinks. 

The service the night we were at the bar was excellent. The cocktails were boozy and yummy. The music was a nice touch.

The 2nd time we went was on a weekend night. It was so packed, we didn't even make it within 4 people of the bar, and after about 30 minutes of just standing there, trying to rummage through all the people, we opted out and went elsewhere on E 4th Street. 

So honestly, this place is awesome when it's not so crowded, but when IT IS as crowded as it was the last time I went, it's best to save some time and hit up another join on the strip."}
{"text":"A great speakeasy with live music on Saturday nights. A nice location too right on E. 4th where everything is happening. We enjoyed listening to crooner Phil Turk all night on Saturday. He was great! He sings from 9pm to midnight every week. 

The drinks were very good (A bit pricey) but good. The Moscow Mules were $12 and a beer will cost you $8. Feels a bit like going out in LA but you do pay for a classy venue and live music. I loved the set up of the bar and that there were a lot of tables and seats for everyone. We had the best seat in the house on the red velvet couch right in front of the piano. I would recommend getting there early to secure a spot. A great place for a date night since it is a cozy and romantic setting!"}
{"text":"This ain't no Velvet Tango Room. 

I dropped in for a night cap after attending a sporting event downtown shortly after Society Lounge opened. I had to laugh because it was a chilly night and I said to the doorman that it must be tough to work outside and he told me he was \"freezing his ass off.\" Swanky seeming place...sport bar mouthed doorman?

I ordered what I pretty much always order - a Moscow Mule. It came in a copper mug (as it should) but the copper straw that came along with it? Kind of awkward. And completely got in my way. I took it out of my drink and was afraid that it was going to roll off my table and onto the floor. It was ok tasting. 

Something about the vibe made me not want to stay and have another drink. Maybe they're trying too hard to be swanky? 

This isn't somewhere I plan on rushing back to, but...it's a nice addition to the E. 4th area."}
{"text":"I visited a few days after the official opening to scope it out as a potential venue for my small birthday party I was planning the following weekend. I checked out their website beforehand after a recommendation...definitely got me excited! 

It's very easy to find on e.4th, especially with the doorman standing outside. There's a short staircase that leads you down to a door, which then leads you into the lounge. It's much smaller than I expected, but it has a nice cozy,yet swanky feel to it. The dim lighting and decor adds to the speakeasy theme...definitely a nice change from the rest of the bars/restaurants on E.4th! I ordered a moijito, which is one of my favorite go-to cocktails. It arrived with a copper straw, which is definitely a nice unexpected touch! The drink itself was nothing special,which kind of bummed me out. 

My boufriend's mother met the owner and talked to him about the private room. I forget the exact number of people it can hold, but it's not a lot (which was perfect for my party). There's a $200(?) minimum for the room, which isn't bad at all, considering most of the cocktails start at $9. Saying that, I decided against hosting my party here. Most of my friends are planning weddings, paying off school loans, etc., so this unfortunately wasn't a practical option. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"I went here last night with a few people from work.  It's got a speakeasy vibe, but they prefer the term \"cocktail lounge\".  Drinks are priced $10-$14 typically, but they put time and effort into making them so I think its fair. I've heard its very crowded on the weekends, but it was a bit dead when I visited (granted it was a Thursday night).  It's conveniently located on 4th street, where many other bars and restaurants reside.

The bartenders were very knowledgeable and friendly.  We chatted with them on and off for the time we were there and they were accommodating by changing drinks to be exactly what we wanted. 

I ordered the cucumber gimlet and an agave, muddled lime, and tequila concoction. I really enjoyed the cucumber gimlet as it was really refreshing. The agave cocktail was good, but didn't stand out to me like the other drink. I also tried a bit of a Pisco Sour (It has a raw egg white in it)  and it was delicious and frothy. If I come back again I'll definitely get it.

Drinks do take a while to get as they hand make each one as you order it.  I waited about 10 minutes for my first drink to be made.  They also didn't have Gibson Martini's which is pretty standard at most cocktail lounges.

There aren't many places like this in Cleveland and I appreciate that the staff is so dedicated to making quality drinks.  I'm a fan overall and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This review is targeted mainly towards the staff at Society Lounge. We were celebrating a friend's birthday last night when another establishment down the street (rhymes with shmutcher and shrewer) did a horrible job of organizing our reservation for a large party of people. We tried our luck and asked the hostess at Society if she could accommodate our group at the last minute. She took down my number and gave us the 'I will see what I can do' line. 

Within half an hour the hostess had contacted us and had a whole area in the back of the lounge booked with seating arranged for everyone! Given the fact that it was a Saturday night and the lounge was already packed we were very impressed. Our waitress took great care of us and though she probably should have been overwhelmed by the size of our group, she got the job done with a smile. They even had the performer join in on the celebration as he sang happy birthday while we cut the cake. 

Well done Society Lounge and thank you for last night!

(only reason they don't get 5 stars is because drinks did take a while to be made)"}
{"text":"After racking my brain for a new place to take a friend to who moved out of Cleveland and returned for for a visit, we ended up on East 4th - somewhat stale by now. This time, however, we skipped Noodlecat, Greenhouse, and even the gold standard of pubs: Flannery's and approached Society Lounge.

First sight: red carpet, velvet ropes and... and a doorman? Really? A doorman holding a clipboard. Well, rather than asking us for a reservation or the secret passcode, the gentleman merely greeted us and held the door open. No need to check the clipboard for that so don't be intimidated by the awkward posturing.

We walked down the stairs to the basement bar. Very quiet and secluded. When we opened the main door, a dimly lit room welcomed us which, if we were color-blind and the room was was filled with cigarette smoke, would be reminiscent of a scene in an early Brigitte Bardot movie. 

We posted up at the bar and commented on the bouncy and somewhat unstable barstools. The crowd was thin but lively and the place seemed overstaffed, as a number of employees just milled around aimlessly. The drink menu is fantastic: all the classics and a few refreshing twists and surprises. The bartenders were knowledgeable, yet slightly pompous; attentive, yet slightly rude. An interesting mix. 

My order was: \"What's your favorite drink to make?\" The response was: The Hanky Panky. An interesting drink, I guess, but when asked why that is the bartender's favorite drink to make, the response was slightly juvenile: \"Because I am in love with Ada Coleman.\" (After Googling: Ada is the drink's inventor) This was not a drink choice based on taste or complexity, it was solely chosen in order to be asked the question of \"Why?\" and to provide a seemingly intelligent mixologist answer. Come on, bud... I would have been more impressed if you gave me three fingers of Johnny Walker Red Label because \"Carlos the Jackal\" drank it.

All in all, a cool place. Good for a quiet after-dinner drink with a date or a close group of friends. Go as complex as possible with your drink order - the bartenders can handle it, and are eager to. Embrace Campari. And if there is someone playing at the piano, sit at one of the barstools placed around it and toast your killer drinks to a promising new place located on the best 300 foot stretch of nightlife in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I honestly had to think long and hard about this review, and deliberate over their final star total here at Society Lounge in the E 4th St area. One side of me tugged towards four stars while the other towards three. Officially I'm going with 3.5 stars here but as you see, they didn't make it to four solid in the total. Some rationale:

Positive: I like the dedicated mixology type of place. A lot of times you want to go to a place that isn't doing a Coors Light buck fifty college special and has that crowd attached to it. The bouncer at the door/basement feel is pretty cool. I like the big murals displayed in the establishment. They have a pretty big selection of drinks in the book, even a couple of cigars offered in the back section of the menu as well. The drink I had was great, I had the whiskey sour. While it wasn't the BEST sour I've had, it was pretty tasty at that. 

Not so positive: It seems they want a speakeasy type of vibe, but then with the modern type furnishings vs. murals vs. really dim lighting...no, DARK, vs. etc. well everything just didn't mesh together and fit. It doesn't qualify as eclectic, just doesn't fit well together for a vibe. It's so dark you can't really appreciate the whole place looking around. I notice this lighting may not be as dim all the time, from the pics I see others have taken on here. It's a nice place, though, well kept from what I can make out. Another thing noted, while I know it does take a while to make a hand crafted mixed drink, it seemed a pretty long time to leave your customer that is sitting at the bar with no customer interaction at all. And it seemed like quite a bit, so don't be in a hurry. A couple of the bartenders (not all, mind you) seem pretty aloof as well, not really acknowledging the world beyond that side of the bar. Luckily mine was a very nice young lady, and she did serve me with a smile.

Bottom line: Good drinks, nice for coming to get a mixed cocktail if that's the order of business for the night. Something about the vibe or ambiance of the place doesn't fit together right though. Would I come back? Probably so. Technically 3.5 stars from me for Society Lounge."}
{"text":"Society Lounge, a quite literally underground jazz club/speakeasy, is doubtlessly the most transportive and capital-C cool bar on that famed slab of foodie decadence, E. 4th Street. Upon entering, one is astounded by the largish bar which glows like something just emerged from a lush Art Deco underworld. The barkeeps seem to have sprung from the same cool cat locale, as well. They make their strong, expensive drinks with bitters, syrups, mashed up fruit, and liqueurs with names no one but the mixologist gods can pronounce. They do so with vigor, and provide detailed history lessons when prompted. These lords and ladies of the vine and still, if you'll pardon the pun, positively overflow with knowledge of their craft. Where did the first gin cocktails originate? What's the key to the perfect negroni? Ask away. You won't be disappointed. While sometimes eerily deserted at happy hour, and sporting not much of a hearty food menu to speak of, Society delights with ghost-of-the-roaring-twenties style. Their sazarac will make you believe heaven not only exists but rests, like a fever glyph of Malcolm Lowry, just below the absinthe-washed rim of a rocks glass."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for a show and we found this place on yelp. It was phenomenal.  The wait staff were friendly and quick with recommendations. When I went outside to smoke even the door guy was great.  We were lucky enough to speak with the manager about Bourbon for a while and he is amazing!  Knows his stuff, very impressive!"}
{"text":"El Chapo rocked my world! I will definitely be coming back whenever I come to Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"Drinks very good but absolutely do not go for food.  Overpriced appetizers with minuscule portions.  Eggplant dish was not edible.  Go late night for drinks & music"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my birthday and I wanted something different and fun to celebrate with. 

I had been to Society once before and I really liked the atmosphere; so I picked this for drinks and a get together for my bday. 

I walked in solo ( my gf was parking the car ) and say down. Almost immediately the bartender came up to me and asked me what I was looking for. I gave him a flavor profile that I liked and he immediately recommended a drink.

It took him about 5 minutes to make it. He came back and told me the name; French 75. Super delicious. Bubbly. Bitters. Citrus. Really good.

After about an hour I had about a group of 10 people and we were all getting drinks and chatting. They drinks did come out fast when we ordered. At one point there were 2 people taking care of us and there was a communication error and my gf had to wait a while. Other than that; it was flawless.

Drinks I tried and recommend; 
French 75 (bubbly and citrus)
4th street sour (my personal fave)
Fernet Fizz (root beer and egg white)
Also tried a 4th drink; but was feeling buzzed and can't remember the name. It did contain applejack, maple syrup, and oj. (Perfect night cap)

I really liked this place for a get together. It's intimate and quiet. The piano table where we sat rules. And the atmosphere rules. Especially for a mellow night on the town. Perfect for conversation."}
{"text":"The bartenders are friendly, helpful, and passionate about their craft cocktails.  I went here twice in one night and each drink I had was one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Surprisingly classy. Good crowd, great piano player, delicious drinks, great service. Had the Moscow mule. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  The following is my opinion only, and yes, I'm a cocktail snob. Sue me. 

I'm sorry Society.  I will come back so that you can redeem yourself. You're so new, it's not your fault.  You haven't had time to distinguish yourself yet.  I know the kinks will be ironed out, I'm sure. It certainly doesn't help that I'm comparing you to PTD/Employees Only and other various speakeasys/lounges in NYC and Manifesto in KCMO.  But good news, you're the place to be. I've never seen so many hot scantily-clad platform-wearing ladies on the prowl in Cleveland before. Single men, this is prime pick up territory.  You're welcome.

Experience:  Experience is what this place is trying to sell you.  The following statement is going to sound ridiculous until you experience it yourself.  Outside is a little red carpet, a a swanky door man with a red velvet rope, and a classy sign.  But once you enter the outside door, you encounter the most well light generic office building stairs ever. It killed the vibe that this place is trying to create.  Enter door number two downstairs, and you are back into the classy lounge you were seeking with couches, tables, a piano and a lovely full wall mural.  Two, the place seemed to be understaffed as I watched waitresses doing their best to accommodate the full house of a Saturday night at 9:30pm.  Our waitress was timely and sweet, given the bustle.  Third, the lounge singer tried a bit too hard.  He has an excellent voice on his own, and he needn't push himself for the Rat Pack style, as this bordered on cheesy and sacrificed his actual voice.  Kudos to raising the bar and having a live singer though. Anyone can pipe in some music. At the end of the night, your bill arrives tucked away in a cigar box.  Note on the ladies' room:  large, pristine, excellent lighting and mirrors, including a full length mirror if you need one. Bonus!

Cocktails:  You MUST request some Luxardo cherries.  They are amazingly good for being a simple cherry.  I started with the Matador.  I couldn't taste any of the tequila, it was smooth, bright and quite refreshing, very balanced, but nothing spectacular.  Next I had the Singapore Sling, which was super boozy, large, also very balanced, not too sweet or fruity.  It came with a gratuitous amount of fruit accoutrements as I had hoped. :)  I also tasted the Ramos Gin Fizz, the Moscow Mule, and the Monkey Gland. Each one was balanced and smooth.  The menu is expansive and full of classics, but for a place that wants to be known for cocktails, the classics are executed very well but they are TOO classic for me.  Unless a straight up Negroni or Scofflaw is all you want of course.  I've seen more inventive twists on original cocktails at BottleHouse and The Fairmount.  There is room for growth through if Society wants to raise the bar for cocktails in Cleveland. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Dimly lit with sensual scents and sounds...Society promises to titilate all senses. Where do I begin? A delectable hot toddy that tickled my pallet like Bob Ross does a canvas? How about high-intrigue relationship troubles? Not enough? There's 80s music blasting in a bar with 1930s decor. Jackpot."}
{"text":"I like, I like.

I went to watch the Republicans at their convention last week, and managed to get in here a couple of times.  The place was packed with beefy middle aged douchebags and their overly made up peroxide blondes, with a sprinkling of really old white dudes reminiscing about how great America used to be.  I imagine that at other times the Society Lounge crowd is hip and righteous, but that's what I saw.

I also saw a bar that is really well run and dedicated to making the best drinks it possibly can.  I watched a bartender muddle and mix and caramelize and froth, and was impressed by the care lavished on each and every drink.  The multi-stage process used with egg whites was particularly impressive.  I ordered a couple of classics and also asked for a Manhattan and an old-fashioned.  In each case the drinks presented were restrained and exuberant and beautiful - exactly what we expect from the best cocktail bars.

I also enjoyed getting educated on Midwestern whiskeys - a few I tired (notably the Oyo Dark Pumpernickel Rye) are on par with the best currently produced in the US.  

In sum, these folk are nice, know what they are doing, and have great sourcing.  If you want a cocktail in Cleveland, I can't imagine why you'd go anyplace else."}
{"text":"I love coming here for drinks. The 1920's speakeasy atmosphere in the basement of this building.. it's like walking through a time portal every time. The bartenders are very dapper and make amazing drinks, although expect to wait a minute or two.. you can't rush perfection. I look forward to coming here every time!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, tapas and atmosphere! Sit at the bar and get to know the mixologists. Leanne is the best. Great surprise find...thx Yelp contributors."}
{"text":"Awesome cocktails and nice, intimate bar. Love the variety of cocktails available see pics below"}
{"text":"Stopped in for cocktails before dinner and was impressed. They have the whole speakeasy, dark basement bar thing going on, if that's what you're in the mood for. The drinks take a little longer to make than your average mixed drink, but they also taste a lot better so it's a trade off. Initially the bartender wasn't very friendly, but he warmed up eventually. If you're looking for craft cocktails in Cleveland, Society Lounge is the place to go."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a great place to have QUALITY hand crafted cocktails.. after doing some research I stumbled apon this place.....
The atmosphere was very well done and very attractive... like nothing I have ever experienced... at least not in Michigan.
We were able to get a comfortable seat which allowed us to view the entire establishment.  We were lucky enough to hear some live entertainment which was VERY good... a young Frank Sinatra.  Our server was very knowledgeable and gave great recommendations....We were so excited  to be here and the night only got better as it went on.  The drinks were fantastic... we were able to chat with the head bartender for awhile ...everyone made us feel very welcome .....
Drinks were awesome!
Service was Awesome!
Atmosphere Awesome!
Entertainment Awesome!
Probably going back one more time before we head back to Michigan

Thank you to everyone that made this a fantastic evening :)

Recommend to those you appreciate a quality drink, great snacks...etc"}
{"text":"We were here a couple of months ago for a Cavs game with some friends. I researched some good walking-distance spots from the arena and this seemed to fit our interests the most. Despite some negative reviews, we checked it out.

It's in a basement, so I'm not sure if it's handicap accessible since I don't remember if I saw an elevator or not. It kind of felt like we were entering a secret lounge, which was fun and exciting. And as you go through those doors, it feels like you're transported to the 1920s. I'm a huge fan of Boardwalk Empire, and this place made me feel like I should have put on some fancy flapper dress.

The place was mobbed - which I expected since a ton of people from the Cavs game flooded in along with us. It took a long time to even squeeze up to the bar and grab a menu, and even longer to be able to order and receive your drinks. We actually just went for a bottle of wine so it didn't take as long as others - but if you order something from their handcrafted cocktail menu, be prepared to wait! It was fun though watching the bartenders make those drinks - now that is what I call a mixologist!

We waited around for a bit and swooped in as a small table of patrons had left. We ordered some appetizers to share, I know we definitely ordered the charcuterie cheese board, but not sure what else we ordered because I was pretty buzzed by this point. We had started drinking at brunch that day with some mimosas, then some beers at a brewery, then vodka mules and wine at happy hour and the game... (I swear we are not alcoholics!)

Anyhoo, if I recall correctly, there were anchovies on the charcuterie cheese board. I vaguely remember trying one and hating it lol. The rest was good though - nothing to write home about, but good. The live jazz music was enjoyable, the atmosphere was amazing, and we just had such a great time! I wish they had a place like this in Buffalo! If we get the chance to return, I will definitely make reservations way in advance. I did my research a bit too late (the week of) so could not get a reservation in time. I'd also like to go back when there isn't a Cavs game, though that may never happen because I don't think we'd ever go to Cleveland without going to a game!"}
{"text":"Such an inviting spot in the basement of a building on 4th.  The inviting decor brings you into the hidden speakeasy downstairs where delightful yet intently made cocktails await your pallet!  Our group tried many of the cocktails and no one had a bad drink.  I had this tasty concoction of wine and a liquor with smoking Rosemary rubbed on the rim of the glass...just amazing and not your average bar.  The waitstaff and bartender were phenomenal and the inside vibe was very groovy for couples and for groups.    I will be back"}
{"text":"Went for a quick drink before dinner across the street! I highly recommend the Mexican Monk! Awesome drink! It was a quiet Tuesday night, so not sure about the regular atmosphere, but seriously...order this drink!"}
{"text":"Super cool atmosphere, but hands down the rudest bartender (and possibly person), I've ever met in my life. She swore at us, told us she was too \"f-ing\" busy, and about 45 minutes before close, said it was time to hurry up and f-ing go home, and also tried to charge the girls in our group twice... Dirty looks, snide comments, swearing; I thought I was being Pranked...I felt bad for the other bartender, because she was so unbelievably rude to him as well. Another group that left at the same time, said the same thing... I've never been treated so terribly. I was so excited about the \"speakeasy\" atmosphere, but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The bartender/manager was very entertaining and informative. This was the best Irish Coffee I have had outside of Ireland. Note- the prices are a bit steep, but worth an experience!"}
{"text":"Society Lounge is my favorite cocktail bar in the Midwest. Yea I know about the other places in town, but this is my favorite. Excellent service, quality mixology, sexy chill atmosphere... Haven't found a reason not to like it. Probably won't. Don't think you will, either."}
{"text":"Interesting spot. We were visiting from Columbus and came here before our reservation at Lola on a Friday night. When you enter, the place is a bit dark and dingy with a hostess available. He directed us to the basement to the lounge area where it wreaked of vinegar. A bartender told us she had spilled a drink, which yes, included vinegar. Honestly, we didn't mind it after a couple minutes. But from a first impression, it will always be \"that bar the smelled like vinegar\" until I can return. 

Drinks were pretty pricy, $8 craft bottles and $12-14 cocktails.

I really enjoyed the ambience, and of course, it is located in an awesome spot in the city, E. 4th.

Hoping to try it again sometime!"}
{"text":"Drinks are yummy. We ordered the French 75 and the Erie Open. Both list champagne as one of the ingredients. Both delicious. But they don't use champagne in their champagne drinks. It's cava. Not that it's not good. Just feel shorted now. And the staff is way overworked. There's not really any collaboration. We waited for at least 7-10 minutes to order and then 3 different bartenders asked us what we wanted within one minute of each other."}
{"text":"Four Stars because there aren't too many places focusing on mixology and making all drinks from scratch, and Society does it very well. I ordered a Delicious Sour, and whoever named the drink was 100% correct - so good, in fact, that I ordered a couple more. For some reason, I have a strong appreciation for a bartender who froths his/her own egg whites in a drink. 

The prices are north of what you normally pay, but not by too much. A cocktail can easily be 10 bucks at nearly any other upscale bar (and even some not-so-upscale), and my sour was $12. And I think it was worth the extra money. Cocktails range from $9 to $13, which isn't terrible. 

The atmosphere was unique. I visited with some friends after an afternoon Indians game, so our attire was not befitting the decor, but the doorman (really?) said that Indians fans are welcome. Which was nice. But we were indeed a bit out of place once more people started showing up. But by then, we were on our third drinks and all cares were set aside. An obnoxious bachelorette party in attendance also helped to divert attention away from us.

The place is pitch black when you walk in from the daylight. I tripped over one of the many black chairs lining the back wall. Once your eyes adjust, you'll see that the decor is a modern interpretation of a prewar speakeasy, complete with live piano music. They're definitely going for polished glamour rather than the classy worn-in feel of, say, Velvet Tango Room or La Cave du Vin. I suppose I prefer the worn-in look, but it's a brand new place so it's not unreasonable for it to look brand new.

With such good booze, there was no room for food in our budgets, but I hear they have a kitchen. Overall, these were some of the best cocktails I've had, which makes Society a good place to revisit every so often. Dinner at the Greenhouse and cocktails afterward at Society doesn't sound too shabby of an evening."}
{"text":"Throwback to the 1920's with the mobsters and Sinatra singing to you from the piano as you lounge in the soft seating and dim lighted nearby seats with candles shining dimly everywhere. From entering down through the staircase into the hidden gem of Society Lounge; you'll have a smile on your face from the beginning to end, not only because of their reputable strong drinks, but experience as well.

The staff are experts in their drinking making traits, with each concocted to perfection. Their extensive knowledge and care in making each, makes the somewhat long wait worth it, perfection takes time. But while you wait, sit back and relax with some appetizers and jazz music usually played by an impersonator. 

Excellent for a romantic after drink date or just to experience this sensual ambiance, Society is my place to be. My favorite touch is the cigar recipe box where you feel like 2016 is years away from the flashback of time you are engulfed in."}
{"text":"I actually was here for a meeting and learned a lot from the bartender about how classic cocktails are made and what makes Society Lounge different. Their maraschino cherries are true cherries and not the ones that come in a can. They were small, squishy and really sweet. I really liked the cocktail they made me when I shared I liked sweeter drinks. Great place to try new cocktails."}
{"text":"I gave it 4 stars because it's a great place to go for drinks...and only drinks. I usually go places where I can get a drink and an appetizer but this place lacked on the appetizer selections. They have an extensive drink menu so it accommodates an array of people but I wish they had more food selections. 
I recommend it for drinks before or after dinner or before or after a show."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Bartenders were extremely slow and incompetent making one drink at a time when the bar was packed. Everyone working there seemed lost with no sense of urgency. After about 45 minutes, we finally got drinks. They were pretty good, but not worth the price. I don't plan on ever returning."}
{"text":"I went to Society for the first time this past Wednesday. I have heard many great things about it and being a new Clevelander I had to check it out. Dylan was my bartender and he is as good as it gets. Extremely helpful in coming up with the perfect cocktail for me. He never got irritated with me asking many questions about not only my drink but other drinks he was making. He definitely made my experience special and I will be visiting again due to his service."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and I love love music. The bar tenders were attentive, even with a full house. The drinks were great, but why is there cucumber in everything?! I would avoid going around 10pm on a Saturday. It was super crowded, but around 11pm the \"party\" crowd disappeared and the people there to have a good cocktail and enjoy music were left."}
{"text":"The Boston sour puts all other whiskey sours to shame!! I get it every time I come here! The food is also very good. The bruschetta is probably too good. Service is amazing. Everyone is always polite and it's a great little period bar. Management and owners did a fantastic job with it. It gives off the perfect speakeasy vibe. For sure stop in for one of the best cocktails in Cleveland! Everything is handcrafted and made with care (they even cut fresh garnishes to order right in front of you!!)."}
{"text":"This is a weird place and I've been here a couple of times.  The entrance is really promising how you have the nice walk downstairs to the actual space.    The decor however is a hodgepodge of I don't know what.  It's part modern cocktail lounge, part piano bar, part dingy basement feel in a random person's house, but with very little of that 1920s-40s old school speakeasy allure or nostalgia, IMO.  The drinks have always been pretty good and strong with a large selection of whiskey, gin, or vodka, etc., based authentic cocktails.  However, I almost always get this odor of mildew/mold emitting from somewhere every time I go...again back to the dingy basement descriptor.  It's hit or miss in terms of if it will take forever to get served or noticed, or if the bartenders/servers will be rude and annoying acting like this is NYC or South Beach.  If you hit it right and all the stars align in terms of service/no odor then this could be a good time.  It's a potential good date spot to take a girl who is a little green and has never really experienced a true speakeasy with a subtle entrance or any kind of potentially cool downstairs bar.  Her mind would be blown.  But, every time I have gone there's been something off and the decor/ambiance is a factor for me.  Meh."}
{"text":"I love this place!

First time I came was by myself around 11 or so on a Friday night. There was a line and I was first in it, but others with reservations of course go in first. Reservations at a bar? How cool is that?!

So I wait a little, in my little black dress, getting chilly and whisper to the door guy \"hey since I'm just one I'm going to sneak in with the next party\" he says\" yes you are!\" Love that man. 

So I do, leaving a group of four girls who thought they were so cool it was \"like embarassing to have to wait \" standing there with their chins on the ground. Sorry bitches. 

I walk into a super active place with multiple bartenders making prohibition style drinks and a frank sinatra wanna be playing piano. My kind of place!!

I find a seat at the bar and order a super cool cocktail I can never remember the name of from a gracious bartender who starts my tab. Fighting off the 20 something year old who thinks an opening line of \"nice stems\" will get him somewhere I turn on my barstool and check out the crowd. A nice mix! Mostly classy, mostly mature, not old, just not 20something. 

Nice stem guy works on my nerves so I move to the other end of the bar where a female bartender does a repeat performance on my uber delicous drink and I mix with some locals, the bartender, and the super cute barback guy with tattoos, geek glasses and a bow tie. 

Next night, Saturday night, I make reservations for 9:00 as I want to bring a friend and dont want to wait in line. Well, there is no line! In fact there was hardly anyone there. We stayed a couple hours and still, hardly anyone there, Was very odd but allowed us to experience even better service and drinks then the night before with some cocktail education being thrown in by the tender as well. 

I love this place, will return everytime I come to town, and hope it continues to draw a nice crowd."}
{"text":"This is definitely not an \"every Friday night\" kind of place, in my opinion, but what they do, they do well.  If you're in to mixology and all the neat things that bartenders can do with liquor, fruit and a flame, this is your kind of place.

I came in here after dinner with a friend for a nightcap.  I ordered off the menu - something with bourbon and absinthe.  My friend told the bartender to \"surprise me\".  Both drinks were phenomenal.  I mean, really really good.  They put on a bit of a show mixing them up, too, measuring out ingredients and torching the orange peel (or whatever) a little bit, rubbing it on the rim of the glass, etc.

This place is slow.  That's part of it.  They're harkening back to a bygone era when folks really savored their drinks, took their time, sipped something strong over the course of an hour as they discussed art, politics, all that kind of thing.  You're not gonna find any Miller Lite or irish car bombs here.

Of note - the bill for two drinks was $28.  Whoa.

Regardless, I'll be back."}
{"text":"YES YES YES YES!!!!!  The drinks, the service, the atmosphere...all amazing and I live and sling drinks in Vegas!  MUST STOP WHEN IN THE LAND!"}
{"text":"I am really impressed with how this place turned out.  Great service from start to finish.  Hard to believe it was the second day of business.  

The place still has a new paint look (and smell!) but I will totally forgive them for that - turning a basement into a cocktail den has to be hard work.  The decor really works and I looove the mural.

The drinks blew us away. The menu, so far, features mainly classics.  I hope they get more inventive going forward because it seems like they have the staff for it.  My Sazerac was hands-down the best. 

They seem to be off to a great start and the area was in desperate need for a place to have a good drink."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience here! We went here last night for a valentines day celebration and everything we had was fantastic. They had everything set up for us and the drinks and food were excellent. I highly recommend the jack rose cocktail. The smoked salmon stuffed with goat cheese was my favorite. It had such great flavor and was delicious. The service was impeccable and everyone was friendly and courteous. I would highly recommend this place for a date night."}
{"text":"I am a fan of society lounge. Gives you that speakeasy feel without the unwanted over the top theatrics of a speakeasy. The drink were really good and well priced. There wasn't a huge crowd there when I went on a Wednesday night after a Cavs Game. Service was topnotch and speedy. I tried the beef jerky and it was really good. Not that many places make their own jerky so kudos to them."}
{"text":"This place is great. And the Aunt Viv is delicious. Hip and comfortable! I've been a few times now and I haven't been disappointed. (I've only been disappointed when I've tried other cocktail bars.)"}
{"text":"I loved this place. If I lived in Cleveland, it would be a place I'd take visitors. Their cocktails are fantastic. I loved the ambiance and the music. It was a winner!"}
{"text":"Society Lounge is an amazing venue with great staff. Their menu has always been great! Weekends are filled with live music and an amazing atmosphere.

I love their 4th street sour. Its a perfect signature drink to describe what they encompass."}
{"text":"It's a cool spot. Loses some of the E4th feel being down the basement, but it's the vibe they are going for. The speakeasy vibe complete with people standing on e4th to open the door for you. Classy. Very good creative cocktail menu. Limited food menu. Friendly bar back (who was busy cooking up on the bar a big pot of ginger for homemade ginger syrup). Bartender knew her drink menu and made them well. I find the drinks served here slip the minds of bartenders in many other places, but she knew how to make them without thinking and did so in an enthralling manner. They even have some drinks created by their head bartender that you won't find elsewhere. Definitely don't go hungry, but definitely do go check it out."}
{"text":"Underground wonderland.  Great cocktail chefs here and very friendly.  We enjoyed the Vieux Carre and a Mai Tai.  Only thing that could have been better was having crushed ice in my Mai Tai.  We went early, so seating was not an issue.  This place is a perfect place for a night cap following a dinner in the area.  They boast live music after 9pm.  We were too early for this.  The underground has that speakeasy feel and mystery.  We will visit again if in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Came for a bourbon tasting.  Although the place was pretty empty, it was pretty classy and swanky,  The drinks were served in nice glasses and were strong.  Nice variety.  Will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Entrance in here is perfect for this space. You walk down a couple sets of stairs and you enter into another decade... the 1920's. The atmosphere is cozy and romantic, perfect place for a date night or a night out with your lady friends!

The drink menu is varied between classic cocktails with a surprisingly southern flair. I had the Corpse Reviver, which was crafted perfectly. I say crafted because the drink is carefully put together with time and perfection. 

They are not whipping up a cranberry vodka and slinging it to you. They are expertly crafting, hopefully, a delicious drink with house made syrups, fresh herbs and fancy cups. You must wait, and hopefully the wait is for a delicious cocktail. I can say that there's a little wait, clocking in around 15 minutes, but worth it. 

We hung around and listened to a very talented crooner sing the classics. I was very surprised to see a TV blaring in the corner. But I guess you gotta please everyone, just  may take you out of that 1920's haze. 

You definitely need to stop in here for a classic cocktail."}

{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. A group of friends went out for a birthday celebration and had a blast. The whole speakeasy vibe is pretty neat, you step down into a lowered \"underground\" like area with dim lighting and a variety of different seating options from two person tables to coffee tables surrounded by comfy benches. Not going to lie, the drinks are a little pricey but I was seriously stoked when I saw that the majority of their martinis included absinthe which is super hard to find usually and if you're with a group you absolutely CAN NOT forget to order a punch bowl! Delicious."}
{"text":"My favorite night spot. Amazing food by Benjamin Tosher, and creative mixologists.  Atmospheric and friendly patrons."}
{"text":"So I've been to society Lounge a few more times since my first review. My second experience was way to similar to my first. But the next two times (most recent being last night) - I went because the people I was with wanted to go. I actually got drinks these two times!! Success?! 

The drinks are good! So far I haven't had anything I haven't enjoyed- I've had the Moscow mule, margarita, mojito, and have tried whatever my friends have ordered and have liked everything. I still like the atmosphere- one of the times I went, there was a guy singing frank Sinatra and he was amazing. I met his brother and mom who told me he sang some Saturdays - haven't been back on a Saturday but I hope he's still there!

The staff still just seems like they're running around with their heads chopped off- maybe they should hire more people??"}
{"text":"Great service, wonderful personality. The servers were fun and flirty. Good times."}
