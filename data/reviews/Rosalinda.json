{"text":"Tried this new vegan Mexican restaurant with friends. Had the Rosa Burger, and tasted the chorizo verde taco, chickpea and beet tostada, crispy tofu and rice bowl, churros, rum roasted pineapple with whipped coconut cream. The food was decent but I can't say it's anything special or memorable. Very disappointing when you consider the pedigree from the chefs involved. The service was excellent: Gracious, friendly, and accommodating. But I think it was quite overpriced for what it was in relation to the forgettable food. So once for me was enough. Chef's Assembly Hall is a block away so I'd rather just go there."}
{"text":"When I heard about the newest vegan Mexican restaurant opening in Toronto I had high expectations- which unfortunately quickly fell short.   First of all, the menu doesn't offer many selections. There are a few options under each course. For the \"dishes\" I use quotes because the servings are more like tapas style than actual entrees. I ordered the veg burger which was good, but not great.  For dessert we ordered all 3 options and shared them: the churros were very dense and a little overly deep fried. The grilled rum pineapple was okay, and the chocolate mousse was pretty good.   I really wanted to love Rosalinda's and  I was expecting awesome, but what I got was just okay.   Sorry Rosalinda, there's definitely room for improvement."}
{"text":"We went to this place based on a recommendation. The restaurant is very well decorated with plants all across the restaurant. We pretty much ordered something from all sections of the menu. The descriptions are long and portions are small :) So you need to order more than 1 item for each person unless ordering the bowl. No doubt the food taste, quality and presentation was amazing. But will I come here again? Not when I'm paying ;)"}
{"text":"Want a meal that takes wayyyy too long to serve and crunchy churros? We received barely any service and burnt churros. Enough said."}
{"text":"So I have been told by multiple people about Rosalinda. Since I was in the area I decided to pay them a visit.   This place stands out in that it's a vegan restaurant that is quite spacious, unlike most vegan restaurants that tend to be cozy.  Food wise I found it to be a bit pricey for the portions being served. For example, their $18 burger looks like something straight out of McDonald's dollar menu. To be fair this is more of a place that you should visit for the ambiance rather than to simply fill your stomach up till it hurts.  Modern decor and friendly service. I strongly recommend this place to claustrophobic vegans who wants to grab a drink and a small bite to eat."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service and beautiful atmosphere! I came here on a Saturday night and it was packed so I had to put my name on the waiting list. I was #21 and the hostess said it would take around and hour and a half but she was actually very quick to find us a seating placement and generous enough to keep the table for us. The restaurant is very well decorated and all the waiters are very nice. Even though it was packed, we didn't have to wait long to get our waiters attention and she was always checking up on us. The overall food experience was good, but super pricey and the portions are small. Each food item had their own twist and unique flavour. The ceviche was pleasantly citrusy, the broccolini was charred which gave it a more meaty taste and the churros with the dip were more banana flavoured. The only thing I got which I think could have been better were the jackfruit tacos. For $14 for two tacos, they lacked originality and their taste was mostly over-masked by their corn tortillas. I'm sure their other tacos are better, but I wish this one had more bold flavours. I also really enjoyed their green drink. It was light and refreshing. Overall, if your looking for a restaurant which embraces the natural flavours of plant food instead of a more heavy junk food place, I definitely recommend coming here. For my three dishes and churros and two virgin drinks, it came to be $68. Since the portions are small, it is a little pricy so be prepared to splurge. I also recommend making a reservation the day before (they don't do same day reservations). I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"The restaurant interior is beautiful and the menu has some good options. The waiter was quite helpful with recommendations, and perhaps we should have taken his suggestions because what we ordered was alright but not great... The rojos seemed like eating $15 Tostitos covered in sauce and the tacos were pretty small (we were expecting that anyway). Overall, I would recommend trying Rosalinda, definitely a nice spot to share with friends."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  We only had time to share some snacks, but my goodness they were fantastic.  Such interesting and unique flavours.  Such a beautiful restaurant with friendly and fast service.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, ambience is peaceful, service was phenomenal. Would highly recommend to Anyone wanting an upscale (not overly expensive) delicious Vegan food."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Rosalinda, but they did not live up to the hype. They're differentiated now because they're the only vegan Mexican restaurant, but this likely won't last long.  Service left much to be desired. We had to ask multiple times for a missing glass, and we had to flag down multiple servers just to order. There was a peanut and sesame allergy at the table, and the server seemed like he didn't know what to do about it, telling us just to order what we want and then he would check after.  The food was subpar. Highlights were the coconut ceviche and the mushroom flautas (similar to spring rolls). The burger patty itself was quite tasty, but it was completely ruined by the soggy, mushy bun. The tacos were interesting but fell flat on texture and flavour. Dessert was disappointing too, with the most dense churro there ever was, and the \"decadent\" chocolate mousse felt like cocoa powder and cream.  Cocktails were interesting, such as an herbal fruity cocktail with chia seeds, and most are decently strong with 2oz of alcohol in them. If you're ordering less carb heavy dishes, make sure to pace yourself!  Likely wouldn't return. Food was average, but the inattentive and confused service made the experience less than desirable."}
{"text":"Best plant-based restaurant in the area! Chicharron is a must have. The coconut ceviche is meh."}
{"text":"I went for lunch as I heard a lot about this place. The place is nice and the service was very good. However it over priced. I have ordered the cauliflower tostadas and the Japanese eggplant plate...I enjoyed the flavours (the tostadas was a bit oily for my taste) the portions were tiny (as in truly tiny) and ended up paying $30."}
{"text":"Honestly not a great experience. We had a reservation but were made to wait an additional 20 minutes, the waitress was nowhere to be found when we needed her and they forgot many of our dishes (or we had to ask more than once for them). For instance, we waited our whole meal for forgotten tacos and at the end of the meal, after having just received them, the tacos weren't offered at a discount or taken off our bill. Just bad customer service.   The reason this is still a 2 star review is because the food is quite good, however the portions are small, not worth the price and be prepared to wait a long time to receive the food. The ambience is quite nice and comfortable, but I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"My first ever vegan experience! And honestly it definitely didn't disappoint !  The best dish was the crispy tofu bowl. And their alcoholic cocktails were also creative and tasty.  Try it out if you are around the area."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Rosalinda for an early dinner on a Saturday evening. We didn't have reservations, but they were able to accommodate us before the later reservations. The restaurant is very big, with lots of different seating options (booths, small tables, long tables for big parties) and has a great ambience. The service was excellent. Our server, Eleanor, was so friendly and very helpful when we had questions about the menu. We ordered a few small plates to share and a couple of mains. We also ordered an alcoholic cocktail and a \"placebo\" cocktail, as they call it. The drinks were innovative and tasty, and the food was absolutely delicious! We loved the entire experience and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Venue - we all know it's gorgeous so i dont need to say anything  (for women at least -- you WILL get trapped in the bathroom stall and have a minor panic attack LOL *doors are finicky)   Service - amazing, so helpful --definitely need a reservation though!   Food - Flautas and the cauliflower tostada were my favourites! Cauliflower had a nice kick from the chilis- a must try!   Chickpea Beet tostada - a bit too sweet for me, and the chickpea puree definitely tones this one down, but still a favourite among the group.  Chorizo taco - I think my expectations were high for this one on account of all the good reviews. It was delicious! But definitely felt mislead with the name, as I expected something with more spice & smokiness to it.  Broccolini & Eggplant - both good but nothing really memorable. They highlight the vegetables themselves; the sauces take the back seat to just compliment the vegetables and not outdo them.   Overall - would definitely return to try the other items! (and get that cauliflower tostada again...so. good. )"}
{"text":"So this place is probably closer to a 3.5, but halfies are not an option.   The BEST dishes, that i highly recommend are the young coconut ceviche (the coconut is smooth, and not too coconut forward, so the citrus balances well, and is bright and fresh with the apple, and celery and beautiful green sauce on top), the chorizo verde is the BEST TACO, not sure how they do it, but this taco I would order again even if there was meat on the menu, the jackfruit taco was a classic vegan preparation done as pulled pork, and it was also tasty! The veggie fritters were also super tasty, and not very veggie forward in terms of taste (picky eaters would probably eat these), and they came with a nice sauce. All the desserts were amazing: the churros were hot and fresh with a banana chocolate dipping sauce, the charred pineapple with coconut cream was delicious, and the triple chocolate mouse was good (though, not as good as a non-vegan version).  The Rosaburger was okay, but a little too sweet and one noted (I love a good veggie burder, but maybe the vegan aspect makes it a lot harder to get the complexity of flavours one often finds with veggie patties), the onion stack sandwich is literally just that, onion rings on a burger bun (and which the onion rings were well done, this didn't feel like a sandwich to me), the roasted Japanese eggplant actually plays second fiddle to the sikil pak (spicy and yummy) and other components on the plate. The jicama salad was our waiters recommendation, and it was okay, but felt like we were just eating jicama in some bland-ish green sauces with lots of pumpkin seeds.   The no gos for me were the onion taco (the only flavour is slimy onion), the spicy roasted carrots (these were not spicy and tasted slightly overdone, and just were generally something you could so easily DIY), and the Tijuana-style broccolini (some kind of smokey flavour they use does not compliment the broccolini, and as someone who regularly eats the stuff, it's not a very exciting vegetable, especially when it is very tough).   The drinks were good! the Pepinon is not too sweet, with a ver nice ginger beer and lime balance, where you can still taste the cucumber. The Punta Rosa is the BEST!!! Order this!!! It is reminiscent of a grapefruit marguarita, and super tasty!   Service was friendly, but a little spacey (things would get forgotten, or missed, and we constantly had to ask for water), the vibe is upscale hipster (no surprise given the location), and the place is beautiful.   I think it's nice Toronto has nicer offerings for vegans, and I would definitely recommend it to any vegans who asked. But with the price ticket and the many offerings in the city, I don't know if I'll be rushing back."}
{"text":"Flavourful foods. Should be seen as a small plates place. The \"meals\" were not sizeable enough. Good food though.  Got the fried egg plant and roasted carrots."}
{"text":"Got to check out Rosalinda the other day, and wow, it is so beautiful. Actually, though the restaurant has tons of plants and feels like you're stepping into a greenhouse, minus the heat.   For those that don't know, this restaurant is the mastermind of Grant van Gameren and Max Rimaldi and Jaime Cook, who founded Pizza Libretto. For this go-round, they wanted to focus on vegan-style Mexican and oddly enough, it works.   Some standouts from when I visited were the roasted cauliflower on a tostada ($7) with herb salsa verde and pickled chili, yung coconut ceviche ($14) and of course, spiced churros ($8).   But the biggest round of applause that I want to give is to their drinks menu. This is one of the first places in the city that I have seen pay attention to their alcoholic menu as much as their non-alcoholic menu. With three drinks on their 'placebo' cocktails menu ranging in price from $7-$9 and all ranging in complexity, it felt well thought out.  I would absolutely return here for drinks and snacks with pals sometimes.  I didn't have enough to eat, so I can't comment on if it's worth it for dinner or if it can compete with the other vegan giant in the city (Planta). But I'd be willing to come back and try. So far, what I tried was pretty great and the cocktails left me wanting more. Plus, the space is pretty cute. So, it seems like this place has lots of potential and I am here for it."}
{"text":"There's magic happening here.   Max Rimaldi and Grant van Gamaren are proving that vegan food can have a large and impactful space in the Toronto food scene. As a restaurant that was envisioned since 2004, pulling the trigger now is not just a \"finally\" moment, but also good timing in the wake of the number of vegan restaurants now showing you can be successful.    Where Grasslands didn't live out its true potential, Rosalinda (and Planta for that matter) show promise in proving that vegan food can have big flavour and doesn't need to be faux meat focus to be successful, or be served from an alley  store in Kensington market. Rosalinda has large open space with sophistication and luxury (think greenhouse chic). There's also a significant focus on bar service and cocktails, which adds to one of the many reasons to visit Rosalinda.       Still there's room for improvement here however. There's a little bit of a consistency issue in the dishes from one visit to the next (the mole carrots will change your life one week, and will be a vinegary mess the other), there's no cappuccino service due to kitchen space issues, and service is a bit inconsistent ranging from unbelievable servers who go above and beyond in explaining dishes and their story, to servers who are just there to serve you and make a tip. A few more tweaks and a heavier hand in maintaining service standards will change things in the time to come."}
{"text":"Amazing menu and a beautiful space!  We started with cocktails that were unique and inspired like the Carrot Colada. We tried virtually the whole menu and each dish was bright, vibrant and had the perfect heat.  They found a new creative way to use avocado, a vegan staple, in the avo-pistachio crema...nom nom.   The dessert was heavenly, whipped coconut and charred pineapple. Simple and perfect.  I can't wait to go back! Que rico!"}
{"text":"This spot opened up just a week or so before our arrival. I had heard about it from one of my favourite vegan food bloggers (shout out to Sam Turnbull at It Doesn't Taste Like Chicken) and was eager to return to the city to try it right away.   I'll say it right away: The drinks and food were a touch pricey for the quantity. Their coconut ceviche was ah-mah-zing, but was a very small dish considering it was around $14. We also had the broccolini interpretation of a Caesar salad, which was very delicious, and we had one \"chorizo\" taco each. The price of our overall meal was jacked up by the drinks (The Rosalinda Margarita and the Carrot Colada), which added almost $30 to our bill.  Would I pay for the experience again? Almost assuredly. It was high-quality food, enhanced by extremely friendly and helpful customer service! I was not disappointed by the hype I had heard and the high expectations I went in with."}
{"text":"We've been vegetarians for about ten years!  Huge hype around this restaurant since the people behind it are also behind some of the best spots in the city (Bar Raval, Bar Isabel, Tennessee Tavern, Henry's). I was picturing hearty and tasty Mexican and Mexican inspired food, kind of in the vein of Vancouver's Tacofino Commissary. With TT, they've done such a good job riffing on Eastern European food and offering something even better than the sum of its parts. But this was not the case at Rosalinda! I was surprised to be so disappointed.   The space looks basically identical to Bay Street's Planta, another upscale vegan spot.  We ordered the broccolini, the smoked onion tacos and the chorizo tacos.   Overall, this is exemplary of the kind of anorexic-chic resto craze where people are willing to spend a lot of money on hyperaestheticized vegan food. But what you're actually getting, past the pomp and circumstance (and fake plants!), is just a $15 piece of broccolini sitting on some dressing and a bunch of \"tacos\" that bear little resemblance to Mexican cuisine. In fact the onion taco tasted kind of like curry. Which is unfortunately a really common thing that chefs do with vegetarian food. Where's the avocado, chipotle, pico de gallo, hoja santa and beans??? I'm all for cuisines that are \"inspired by\" regional cuisines or approaching them like \"fusion\" but why is there Japanese eggplant on the menu but no tortilla soup or huaraches?? Just because you put something on a corn tortilla and call it a taco doesn't make it \"Mexican food.\"   The food was fine but way overpriced for what it was (we're never looking for \"filling\" but we are looking for a flavour and ingredient experience that justifies its cost, which we didn't get here).   They are also charging $9 for a small can of beer, lol."}
{"text":"3.5 stars... there are some really good flavours coming out of the kitchen but I think they're still working out some of the kinks in terms of kitchen pacing.    I love when I see vegetable focused places open up that bring in new flavours.  Not every vegetarian or vegan places need to be about buddha bowls or salads only.  I love me a good salad but a new different take or flavour profile would be a welcome relief.  Rosalinda brings the Mexican spices and herbs while still respecting vegetables.  I can get behind this.  The space is quite beautiful. When you walk in, you see the first dining area framed in an indoor greenhouse.  The space is open, slightly industrial but softened with a lot light, delicate blues, and soothing greens.  I have to breath a sigh of relief that the space allows you to have great conversation and enough space between tables that you're not hearing theirs.  Too many new places just put the volume at 11 and destroys any chance of having a great night with food and conversation.  The staff here is energetic and happy to help with the menu.  There are many people walking about so it's easy to grab their attention if you need it.  They did provide a bottle of water at the table so you didnt have to wave them down for that.    The menu has snacks, apps, mains, and desserts on it.  Im going to be real about the portion size... it's the constant negative comment from all the reviews.  Most mains are on the small size ... we saw the broccollini and squash on neighbouring tables.  They do look like sides at other high end places.  If the menu was more honest to say 'small plates' (I know... it's a dead trend), I think people would have a better mindset that you need more than a dish for your main and understand this is a splurge place.  I understood coming here that an order of tacos will not fill you up and some orders are just a single item (tostadas).    So the big reason why I am giving this less than 4 stars is the kitchen pacing and it wasn't only our table that experienced.  More than once did we see other tables ask the waitress what happened to their dishes when waiting more than 25 minutes for the next dish.  Seeing how these dishes were not very big to start, waiting nearly 30 minutes after 3 bites of food is excessive.  I'm not sure what happened but this made for really long waits and low table turnover.    Young Coconut ceviche - I liked this dish a lot.  The use of leche de tigre (Peruvian marinade made of limes, onions, and chillis) was a bright acidic pleasant burst on the tender young coconut.  The young coconut texture was more similar to tender squid than fish and I thought it worked well.  The addition of sweet apple pieces, celery, and shallots just made the flavour more nuanced.  You can easily share this appetizer but understand it's made for 2 people at most.  4/5  Mini potato and mushroom flautas - This was another good dish and has a lot of umamai thanks to the mushrooms.  I dont think this can fool anyone thinking there's meat in there but the richness of the flavour is just really amazing.  The crispy shell contrasted nicely to the tender and meaty potatoes and mushrooms.  The poblano salsa was a nice bright green and gave a hint more spice to the flautas.  I think a lot of the flavour came from the inside ... the salsa was pretty tame in comparison.  4/5  This is where we experienced our big lull in service.  During this time we've seen another 2 tables in our area just wait and wait for their tacos.    Roasted cauliflower tostada - For roasted cauliflower, I was a bit surprised on how pale all of the cauliflower looked.  There was maybe only a touches of the florets that had a lightly bronze piece.  I expected more roasting to give it a nice nuttier flavour.  This one was sadly missing flavour... it needed salt or anything to perk up the steam like vegetable. The sikil pak (pumpkin seed dip) looked like it would have provided that but sadly didnt.  3/5  Chorizo Verde tacos - This was an interesting taco.  Two to an order, this was spicier of the two tacos we ordered and the heat was a nice mild kick.  For anyone thinking this is mock meat.. no, it's not meant to replicate meat.  I felt it was like a very thick ragu sauce texture with nice little pieces of crunch and crispy cucumber and onions. 3.5/5  Jackfruit Pibil tacos - Of the two tacos, I think I liked the jackfruit more ... probably because of the crispy taro root that is a mountain on top of the taco.  Pibil is meant usually for slow roasting pork so applying the same thought to jackfruit (which is quite meaty in texture) sounded interesting.  I have to admit, this worked pretty good.  I know it wasn't meat but it had a great flavour and the mount of crunch taro was just fun to crunch through.  4/5  I feel the kitchen is not ready for the super busy dining room.  If they keep up, the 90 minute wait for walk ins would probably be more reasonable. For now, it's a promising spot but not quite 4 stars."}
{"text":"Nice spot. Great service. Food, meh.   Standouts: chicharron with avocado, chilaquiles rojos (nachos), smoked onion taco (except that we let it sit too long and the shell became soggy). Fries that came with the burger were great too   Disappointments: coconut ceviche (didn't taste like ceviche or coconut, just bland and undesirable texture), burger, jack fruit tacos.   Trust your servers recos and you should be all set. He also highly recommended two of the desserts that we didn't have room for.   Excellent Chenin Blanc. Decent Sauv Blanc (by the glass). Wasn't keen on the rose.   Probably won't return until they revise the menu. Seems that they are still working out some kinks."}
{"text":"Just got back from dinner here and had a very negative service experience. The food itself was good, although portions were small. We made our way to Rosalinda specifically for their famous vegan burgers. Once we arrived, they told us they were out of burgers (which is totally acceptable). The issue arose, however, when one of my friends asked instead for the fries supreme that comes with the burger on its own (as they were sold out of the burger). Our server refused us straight up, and said they cannot give the side on its own. When we asked why, we were told that the fries were proportioned with the burger in perfect quantities, so giving them separately would break proportions. Admittedly, I do not run a restaurant, but this didn't make any sense to me. We got our food after a long wait, and as we ate, we actually saw the burgers being served out of the kitchen. We finished our food and waited 20 minutes to get the staff's attention to get our bills (and the restaurant was not that busy). We had to ask them three times before we got the bill. At one point, after we had asked twice, our server approached us and asked if we wanted churros. We expressed that we just wanted the bills, quickly paid and were on our way out.  Now, I know serving is an incredibly hard job, and maybe this particular night was different than the rest, but our experience was poor and we left feeling unheard, unsatisfied, and drained from waiting. Maybe it was just a one time thing, so if you're looking for a new vegan spot, you might have a better experience than we did dining at Rosalinda."}
{"text":"An excerpt from a longer review...   \"The small food menu, designed for sharing, featured a selection of simple vegan plates, tostadas and tacos topped with everything from roasted cauliflower to jackfruit pibil (to prickly pear cactus). From first glance, it was reminiscent of Matthew Kenney's Bar Verde in New York City.  We started with the Young Coconut Ceviche ($14), a marinated mixture of coconut, apple, celery and pickled shallot that offered some interesting textural components and pops of colour. The herb leche de tigre offered a fresh note, but the overall flavor profile was too acidic to be enjoyed. An \"A\" for effort, but pass on this one....\""}
{"text":"The best vegan restaurant in Toronto. Guac, cucumber salad, veggie fritters, multigrain chichorrron, churros, all utterly fantastic. 5/5. Great drinks/beer menu too! They have sours even. Nice staff. Beautiful decor. Blows Mythology and Planta away."}
{"text":"I'm the type of person who's always excited to experience new things, I went to Rosalinda excited to try a new spin on Mexican cuisine. One of the things this restaurant gets really right: disregarding the value of good service in the overall experience of the diner.   Came here last night with a group of 7 and ordered drinks and a whole variety of dishes. I had the Second Skin which was basically a tequila manhattan. The drink was flavorful and also very strong! Which definitely helped ease the difficulties of the rest of the experience.   Now part of this is our fault: reservations were made for 6 but we ended up with 7. We were seated at a booth for 6 however the lack of space was the least concerning part. We had to ask 3 separate waiters for cutlery and a glass for the 7th guest on 4 occasions (and then 2 separate waters came to the table!). Closer to the end of the meal while ordering drinks, one person in our party ordered a beer which we had to remind the wait staff about 3 times after placing the initial order. Even for something as simple as a glass of water or drinks, the wait staff appeared disorganized and dysfunctional. But maybe 4th times the charm?  The food was decent! We ordered some snacks to start (totopos and chicharrons) both of which came out almost as quickly as they were forgotten. Nothing to write home about with these ones. Additionally, we were offered a refill of chips for the totopos spreads which we had to ask about on 4 separate occasions AFTER the initial offer. The chips finally came after the 3rd or 4th course. For sharables we got the young coconut ceviche and the mushroom and potato flautas. The ceviche tasted light and vibrant with the coconut meat serving as a great substitute for fish. The flautas were crispy and had a great earthy notes from the mushrooms. We also ordered the roasted cauliflower tostada and brocolini, both of which were slightly bland but had a lovely crunchy texture. Next, we shared the crispy tofu and rice bowl, which was definitely a highlight. All the flavors in this dish went really well together: the salty, crunch of the crispy tofu with a fishy bite of the seaweed. For tacos, we ordered the chorizo verde and the smoked onion taco. The corn tortillas held everything together really well and the tacos were flavorful but also distinct with each bite being oddly similar to a mexican taco with meat in it. We finished with the black bean burger and a side of the fries \"supreme\". We also had desert although these dishes were not our favorites (to the point where they weren't even finished). We had the churros, which were dense and dry, and the chocolate mousse which was kind of bitter and was reminiscent of artificial whipped cream.   Overall, the experience was underwhelming. The food was alright (3/5) but the service really needs improvement (1/5). All of the waiters and waitresses are friendly but there seemed to be a lack of communication between all the staff that prevented them from being effective. Pretty disappointed even though I was looking forward to this experience."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food. Nice decor.  Bought a mocktail that was 90% ice.  Pricey, tiny dishes. I suppose you're supposed to buy 4 or 5 dishes to make a meal. If the food was amazing, I'd be okay with that. But it's just kind of average."}
{"text":"It's great to see diverse vegan options apart from the standard salad or salad bowl (nothing wrong with that though)!   We ordered the multigrain chicharron, which was like rice cakes with guacamole. The guacamole was amazing with a lemon-y twang. The rice cakes were interesting... a little bit greasy to the touch and hard to scoop guacamole with.   The jackfruit tacos had crispy bits of taro (amazing) and the jackfruit had the texture of pulled pork! The flavour could have been more powerful, or I wish we had hot sauce available on the side.   I tried a bite of the burger, and the texture/taste was a close as possible to a real meat burger. The size of the burger and even the bun was pretty small in comparison to regular burgers though.  Overall cool place, with a beautiful interior. I'm not vegan, so I probably wouldn't come back unless with I was with vegetarian or vegan friends."}
{"text":"Cute and trendy vegan place in the city. Mexican themed dishes are quite flavourful and well plated.  Portions are small however AND our server messed up our bills; we were a party of 8 but it wasn't that confusing! Lol.  Anyhow, I ate a roasted Japanese style eggplant and tried some coconut ceviche. Not bad at all. Decor is pretty and minimalist but the fake plants are tacky and I would insist they get real ones.   The bar menu is also interesting with lots of variations. I got a Del Sol which is made of  tequila, kombucha, hibiscus syrup and herbs. Very refreshing!"}
