{"text":"The server was more worried about reapplying her lip gloss than refilling the drinks. The food wasn't all that great either so probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican. VERY TASTY. consistently good. Reasonably priced. Just close your eyes and point to anything on the menu and you will be happy with your choice. 
Mostly Spanish speaking clientele and staff. Staff is bilingual and you will feel welcome if you do not speak Spanish. I go there regularly. We take all of out of town relatives. They love it. Very nice decor, esp for Albemarle Rd. Can't go wrong.
They also have vendors that sell flowers and produce.
Also the owner often donates catering to nonprofit events that we have attended. Love that."}
{"text":"First time trying their food was by take out. It was really good. We ordered sopes and tacos. Second visit, we decided to eat in with family. Service was great but we kept having to shoo flies away and eventually got up to the register to pay since the waitress was taking so long. Third visit was horrible! My husband had a piece of hair in his taco, we kept having to shoo flies away from us and when I took my daughter to the rest room their was a roach. The kitchen wasn't pleasant to look at since it was on the way to the restroom. We will definitely not eat here again."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Food is delicious, service is friendly and the price is right.  Try the pupusas."}
{"text":"We happened to drive by and stopped in on a whim. Great find and authentic Mexican food... can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly staff and delicious food . I came down to Charlotte from NY to visit family and stopped by to try thier famous enchiladas. Highly recommended trying their horcarta as well. Next time I'm in town I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing authentic Mexican food, some of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Fonda La Taquiza has the best carnitas lunch in Charlotte IMO.  Massive quantity and terrific quality. If you find better, I want to try!"}
{"text":"From the outside it wouldn't be the first choice  once you come in your might have a change of mind. I ordered the torta de chorizo with horchata to drink, the horchata was great had to order 2 now the torta was good good size if you super hungry. Now my girl friend order 3different types of tacos   Chile relleno, taco de alambre, chorizo , pretty good and inexpensive for the authentic flavor although you could easily tell the chile relleno was ether microwaved or had been sitting in a wet container for a while (could really ether improve or remove this option from the menu) but hey it's still not bad at all for the flavor and price."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, today.  Given that the advertised lunch specials run $5.75 including beverage I was expecting something on the order of sodium laden, uber-heavy lunchtime fare typical of Mexican restaurants in the area; and that would have been just fine for the price.  But boy was I pleasantly surprised!  

To my eye, I was the only one in there who did not appear to be of Latin descent.  This I took as a particularly good sign, perhaps even an indication of some level of authenticity in the cuisine.  The place was clean, the decor inviting and the staff warm and welcoming.  The carpet was noticeably worn, which was the only upkeep issue that stood out for me

Now on to the food...  For starters, my server brought me a complimentary bowl of bean soup (delicious!) and also placed on my table a small platter with three sauces and a wedge of lime (nice touch).  From the lunch menu I opted for a slightly pricier pollo dish (all of $6.25) and it was a good choice.  The white-meat chicken, peppers, onions and sauce melded wonderfully inside the flour tortillas that accompanied the plate.  The beans and rice were fairly run-of-the-mill, but plenty tasty, and again not so darn salty, as is so often the case at the Mexican restaurants.  All-in-all this was a wonderful meal.    

Staff were attentive throughout and extremely friendly.  Surprisingly, the place was not busy at all, but I sure hope they stick around.  I know I'll be coming back as often as I can and as long as they stay open."}
{"text":"As authentic as it gets. Great prices. Luckily they just brought in a waitress that speaks English because for a while I had to point and mime."}
{"text":"No longer \"Fonda\" La Taquiza.

This has been a staple in our diet for the last several years. We have ranted and raved about the food in an effort to drum up business because we were so impressed by the food and service. We would eat in, get take out, and utilize FoodieCall at least a few times a month so I feel safe calling ourselves regulars.

My mother was in town visiting for the weekend and it happened to be Cinco de Mayo, so naturally we went for dinner. It was somewhat busy when we walked in, but not packed, and we were immediate seated at a booth. We ordered 3 cantaritos and munched on chips and salsa while we waited for our drinks. After about 10 minutes, our drinks arrived and the waitress took our order. My mother and I each got two pork tacos and split a chile rellanos while my husband ordered pork enchiladas. I asked for a water as well as silverware.  Approximately 10-15 minutes later our food was delivered. We still had not gotten the water or silverware. We asked the young lady who brought our food for silverware so that we were able to eat. We then sat there and waited. And waited. And continued to wait. I got a little upset after 10 minutes and had to get up and ask for silverware (for the THIRD time, twice with the food already having been served). I found our waitress in the bar area and finally got silverware so that we could eat. By that time the food was cold, not to mention the fact that the \"pork enchiladas\" my husband orders most definitely did not resemble enchiladas- there was corn tortillas on one side of the plate doused in a verde sauce and a well flattened piece of grilled meat on the other side of the plate that did not look or taste like pork. (We are pretty sure it was chicken, but it was hard to tell. It was dried, leathery, and ice cold by the time he got a fork and knife to try it.)  After eating our cold, mediocre meal my mother and I asked for a second beverage. We waited about 15  minutes without seeing our waitress or our cantaritos and I AGAIN had to get up from the table and ask them to cancel the drink order, we were ready to leave. We would just like the check.

Thank god I cancelled the second round of beverages.  The little 12 oz clay pot cups were priced at $20!!!  The food was less than $30 and they wanted me to pay SIXTY DOLLARS for THREE DRINKS?! I've had fancy cocktails at five star James Beard Award winning restaurants that involved smoke (literally), fresh handmade syrups, and extremely high end spirits that were only $10-12 per beverage.

I wanted to cry. Not only had my favorite spot in Charlotte been tainted by bad food and worse service, but I felt like I was being robbed at the same time. On the verge of tears, I argued with the waitress that I have no problem paying for drinks, but $20 a cup was obscene and I wasn't paying it. She spoke with someone briefly and decreased the price to $12, which I still feel was ridiculously steep considering that the \"fresh juice\" came out of a Sunkist dispenser identical to the ones you see in the lobby of a Holiday Inn Express, next to the mini cereal boxes and the \"make-your-own-waffles.\"  Frankly, I paid it so I could get the hell out of there.

Did I mention that the stall in the womens bathroom DID NOT HAVE A FREAKING TOILET SEAT ATTACHED?! It's just a toilet bowl with nothing to sit on. I am not even kidding. 

All I am left with is a hole in my pocket, a bad taste in my mouth, and a hankering for GOOD Mexican food. I'd love recommendations because I will not be returning here again.  Thanks Fonda La Taquiza for crushing my hopes and dreams."}
{"text":"The food here is great! Probably one of the best Mexican places I've been to. Definitely authentic and very fresh. Lots of different hot sauces and salsas. I had the carne asada, steak quesadillas, steak torta and churros. All very yummy!"}
{"text":"Quick recap: overall fast service and excellent food. No real complaints other than location isn't the best but that doesn't take away from the delicious food that came in heft proportions. 

Chips on the table as usual for a Mexican/Hispanic restaurant. These chips were warm and not oily. Nice and crispy. Plenty of salsa options to work with so this alone made the place stick out. 

Got tacos of chicken, asada, pastor, and chorizo. The asada and chorizo were phenomenal. Chicken and pastor was good but the others were clearly stand outs. Classic with the onion and cilantro with plenty of salsa to spice it up. Only got one wedge of lime for the 4 tacos but I'm sure they would be willing to give more. 

The place was clean, not too busy bc if the location probably. Totally worth checking out if you're looking for something new."}
{"text":"Horrible drek. I got my Fonda La Taquiza food delivered from Foodie Call. It showed up in one of two ways; either mushy or burned. And by burned I mean burned black. inedible.

Some of the reviews give Fonda La Taquiza five stars. If you think for an instant that this is a five star restaurant, you are a relative of the owner.

Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!"}
{"text":"I order from Foodie Call, they have good food and good service they've forgotten a thing or to on occasion but they always make it right. 

If you have a small group try the Molcajete it's awesome!"}
{"text":"I found myself close to Fonda La Taquiza at lunch time today, and stopped to check it out. Before going in, I looked to see if they were on Yelp so I could check out the reviews, but they had not been listed yet.  I decided to take a chance and check them out anyway. 

When I first walked in the door, the place was a bit under-whelming... the décor could certainly use some updating - especially the carpet because it was in terrible shape (run-down and taped in several spots.) Also, the carpet was not as clean as I would have liked to have seen, but I decided to overlook that and give the food a try.  So, when I got the menu, I saw a good selection of options but decided to just go with a chicken burrito.  

While waiting for my order, my server brought out chips and salsa.  I really liked the salsa - it tasted fresh and had just enough spice & good flavor. The chips were fairly thick, but nice and warm.  It did not take long for my lunch order to come out, and I dug into in the burrito right away.  It was filled with rice and pulled chicken.

The lettuce, tomato, avocado, and sour cream came on the side... and I asked for more salsa to go with it since the little bowl of salsa that was originally brought to the table was so tiny.  

I was impressed with the burrito - it had good flavor and was packed with lots of chicken.  In fact, I could not eat the whole burrito, but I did dig all the chicken out and eat it since it was so tasty. 

I am not normally a soda drinker, but because they have the Mexican sodas which are made with real sugar, I splurged and got the pineapple one. It was very tasty. 

While looking at the menu, I had thought about ordering some churros - but after my meal, I was too full.  Shame because they were probably tasty as well. 

The meal including my drink was right at $9.50 so this place is quite affordable.  (I think the burrito was $7 or $7.50 before tax). 

Bottom line, I would not come out the of the way to eat here, but if I found myself to be close-by at lunch or dinner time, I would stop back in to give them another try. 

My food and service was good, and I would have given them higher marks, but they really need to do a better job vacuuming the carpet before lunch/dinner so that the place looks a little cleaner."}
{"text":"I'm from El Paso, TX, and this is the most authentic Mexican restaurant I've found in Charlotte so far!"}
{"text":"Cute place.  I'd go back.  I'm not sure that I made the best selection for me, but I was pregnant at the time.  The 2 others in my party seemed to enjoy their choices.  We enjoyed the wait staff, she was polite as we talked a good while before we ordered, continuing to check on us until we were ready to order.  I'm not sure when they updated the inside, but the floor is tile, no more carpet.  Disliked: We stayed until close to closing, they were cleaning the floor, most places don't clean next to your table, but here they did, we were 3 tables from the door.  Also, the \"band\" that came by the table was loud and annoying."}
{"text":"Having a lot of Hispanic friends and a lot of them being from Mexico, I've learned what true authentic mexican cuisine is all about. I had their mole, and it tasted almost like the amazing flavor I had when I was in Mexico. Not greasy and deep flavor. Home made tortillas and great lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food, great lunch prices. Specials include a drink. Can't beat them for the price. I've tried the Chile Verde and the Chimi. Both were delicious. Cheese dip is also good. Chips are come with several types of salsa. The house and the verde were my favorite. $16 for me and the wife to eat lunch and neither of us finished. Very decent portions. I will definitely be back as often as possible."}
{"text":"Am from Texas where the mecican is great this Restaurant is just as good as the food from Texas"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food, the most authentic Mexican food, I've ever had in my life.  We were in the neighborhood and had heard about this place.  It doesn't look like much.  We were the only people there that were white, and nearly all the customers appeared to be Latino, which I assumed was positive.  
This place used to be called Cocina Latina and was listed in the Our State Magazine 100 places in 100 counties.  They still had the recommended food item, the enchiladas verdes con pollo on the menu.  It was fantastic.  The tortillas were clearly made from scratch and the homemade green sauce was spectacular and spicy.  We also had some homemade guacamole and an assortment of salsas that were brought to the table.  I'm still not sure what some of these salsas were, but they were all awesome.
I really enjoyed my experience.  This isn't gringo mexican, this is authentic.  Go for it!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend this place if you wanna have a drink. 
First time coming down to NC.. the food was alright, not the best Mexican food I had. The drinks were not strong, the prices for some drinks were outrageous for the amount of liquor.. there was a lot of fruit inside the drink so it was only like 4 oz n the rest was ice n fruits. (For the price of $20 per drink)"}
{"text":"This was a cute truly authentic Mexican place. I will start with the sopes are huge and beautiful, perfectly done. The enchiladas are different- and I know this is one of the traditional ways that's subjective, but you should know- the tortillas come folded in half with sauce and cheese, and your fillings were on the side. Good flavor, wouldn't order it again though. I give 3 instead of 4 because there are so many authentic Mexican places out there, it's quite competitive and I don't see this fairing higher in that market."}
{"text":"Don't listen to the ridiculous people leaving crap reviews. 1-star and you got delivery? Haha ok dude.

After growing up in the southwest and eating at some of the greatest Mexican restaurants in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas, I can attest that this restaurant fits the bill.

Authentic. Fresh. Warm and welcoming. CLEAN.

The food is top notch.

Don't miss this place when in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I just munched my way through a delicious order from these guys, delivered by Foodie Call. I had a huarache, which if you are not familiar, is like an elongated and extra thick handmade corn tortilla. Topped with tasty beans, meat and veggies, they're a little messy to eat but completely worthwhile. Compared to other huaraches I have consumed, this one was a strong contender. They send along a cup of delicious spicy pot beans to go with it, and three delicious sauces ranging from mild(ish) to smoky to hot. Their prices are so low that it was a little hard to make the Foodie Call order minimum, so I had some of their flan as well. Would eat again!"}
{"text":"Food it's good! I can't complain about that, but service its terrible I came to place a order to go the took a while to take my orden even if they saw me in the entrance I keep telling them I just came to place a order they just keep it ignored me."}
{"text":"The food was great but service was mediocre, and the drink prices are insane for what tasted no better than a Seagrams wine cooler. 

So, as a takeout place, I totally recommend based on the food. 

As far as enjoying a meal here, there are tons of other restaurants around I'd probably pick over this one that would be a better value and of better quality. But, this place isn't bad - and I hear they have mariachi on Sunday. So, maybe just go on Sunday instead of a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"I am not kidding when I say this is some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. It is also some of the most consistently awesome.

It seems like everything I order is cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and just... Perfect. Tortas are huge and come on great bread, tacos of any meat are tender and flavorful, and every other plate I had was delicious.

I feel like this resurant deserves all the love on the world."}
{"text":"La Taquiza, pronounced Tah-kee-zah, is a small, homestyle or \"Casera\" Latin American restaurant. The closest thing I've seen in my lifetime would be the small, domestic kitchens that would serve authentic menudo and pozole on long communal tables in residential homes. It was a weekend thing in Durham but you had to know someone. Invitation only. 

La Taquiza captures that enviorment insofar as the venue is clean, intimate and unassuming. Moreover, the food is terrific and hard to find anywhere much less in the Queen City. 

La Taquiza has a wide array of breakfast lunch and dinner choices. Prices range from 1.99 for a specialtry tacos to 47.99 for the Mocajete Taquiza, a meat heavy, made for tge family dish that seems to have a little bit of evrything.

Like most Latin American restaurants in Charlotte, La Taquiza offers a menu selection thst spans all of Central America, parts of Columbia, the Southwest and Mexico. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and the clientele is primaraly but not exclusively of Latin Amercan decent. Always a good sign when it comes to ethnic food. 

I love the lunch menu, ranging from 6-8 dollars, I've always been impressed with the attention to detail and variety of options. Regional favorites like Huaraches, a bean and meat filled thick tortillia  pupusas, what I liken to a \"masa\" laden pizza. (\"Masa\" is the \"thick tortilla\" I so unelequently refferred to before. They make it  in house and would remind you of a Columbian Arepa.An entire page of there menu is dedicated to a medely of \"masa\" related dishes.) 

Baleadas and fajitas round out the culinary equation along with Mariachi bands on Sunday. Friday-Sunday, it's a cozy, slightly romantic, family friendly venue that doubles during the weekday as a convenient workmen's delight. 

Accessable, authentic, attentive and friendly. It's easily one of the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Chili Rellano was great. Also served with rice, beans and fresh made corn tortillas 
 Even though I ordered take out, still ce with the nacho chips appetizer. Good prices"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here twice in a week and so far are very pleased with the food! I've had the veggie fajitas and he's had the chile poblanos. Both times we've been, the food has been on point. We will be back!"}
{"text":"It's all about good food here. The authentic taste is incomparable to other Mexican restaurants in the area. The only reason why I did not give La Taquiza a 5-star rating is due to its customer service. The waitresses are very friendly, however their speed is not the quickest. In my group of 6, most of us ordered tacos which is not the hardest thing to make on the menu. It literally took 5 mins in between each order to arrive at the table. So we all stared at each other's food until we all were served. This is a golden rule for restaurants; get the food out together! Other than that, I definitely recommend the food here."}
{"text":"This place has really good food when they're consistent I feel. I been here a total of three times, and the last two times my food has been wrong. One was a take out order, my food came with extremely spicy fajitas. Not to mention that the fajitas has all of these vegetables that were not mentioned that was going to be in them. They left out my bread for them, but otherwise the food was ok. The second time I got a burrito, it was AMAZING, the last time they could not get my order right to save my life! Then when I kept retiring it they became annoyed. Instead of fixing it correctly they were trying to save face and pick out the cheese, sour cream etc. I would maybe go here for lunch, and eat in if I ever go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Awesome drinks! Staff is very friendly!! I stopped in because my car was getting serviced next door and it was a great lunch decision! I'll definitely Be back!"}
