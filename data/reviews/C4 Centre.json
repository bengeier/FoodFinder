{"text":"This review is based solely on the food served...GROSS.  Not only did it take 10 minutes to take my order while standing in line with no one in front of me, it then took another 10 minutes for them to start cooking my burger.  I was asked repeatedly (by the same older woman) to place my order, which I had already done and paid for and each time I reminded her of my order she was confused.  I ordered a burger, small milk, and a coffee.  Not difficult!!  After asking me 3 times for my order and trying to charge me twice for the order, the older man finally began making the hamburger.  A full 30 minutes after I arrived at the snack bar I received my food, and I must say it tasted HORRIBLE and was totally RAW in the middle.  Straight in the trash after the first bite.  

If you want food, stick to the chips and nuts, but steer clear of anything cooked.  Even the fries (the older man was snacking on each order as he served it up with his fingers)."}
{"text":"The older lady that greeted us was very rude and unwelcoming. The sign they put up was a bit confusing so when we went in to ask she just told us to read it. This was my first time with them and I will not be going back. I won't recommend it to anyone."}
