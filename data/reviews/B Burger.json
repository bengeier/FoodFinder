{"text":"Waheeyyy!! Looks like I have finally found my favourite Burger spot in MTL!

We decided to try this place out one Friday evening and what an unforgettable experience it was! 

The place is simple and comfortable with a sufficient amount of seating and the workers are all super friendly & hospitable. 

The menu has a variety of Burger options - I opted for the Picante (spicy) one with a poutine. The burgers are huge and super juicy, each bite is better than its previous! Just super delicious, succulent patties topped with their signature sauce and the full works of dressings - the spice level was definitely on point! I also loved the Poutine as the fries are hand-cut with potato skin - my favourite!

Now for the best part of the evening... 
We enjoyed this whole experience in total darkness! Just so it happened, as the waiter was bringing out our order, the entire area lost electricity and it was pitch black. With everyone's phone lights switched on, nothing could stop us from devouring this masterpiece of a burger... it truly was an experience to remember! The owner even brought us over some drinks on the house, which was very kind of him. 

Cannot wait to be back - hopefully this time to enjoy the Burgers through sight and not just through taste :)"}
{"text":"One the best halal burgers you can have in the city! Just splendid! The fresh cut fries were perfect, too."}
{"text":"WOWOWOWOWOW!!! This place just opened recently and I can't even tell you how amazing it was. Not only it's 100% halal but its the BEST burger i've ever had in my entire life, im not even overreacting. It was so juicy, you can actually TASTE the meat, I had the picante burger and the home made fries that were out of this world, not to mention their homemade mayo???? omgsh and the poutine was spot on!! OUTSTANDING!!"}
{"text":"Mouth-watering ? Tasty? To die for ? Juicy ? Fresh ? Meat lover ? .. All of the above if not more i shoutout when i think of Bburger ! The best meat pattie you can ever bite into in Canada! For my halal foodies this place beats top gun steaks, burgenator, big moes located in toronto ... The burger pattie can be either of 150g or 180g with a maximum of 360g (two patties) im sure if youre up for the challenge the chef can make it a triple decker :p ! The burger can be customized with different toppings, sauces and other condiments such as grilled mushroom, jalapenos etc. 

Do not under estimate the taouk, its a really tasty chicken filet  well marinated and grilled to perfection ! 


As sides the poutine or fries are both lovely ! With Hand cut potates you cant go wrong

Open till late at night, prices are VERY reasonable and the young crew is friendly. Feeling like a snack or feeling very hungry .. Its the right spot ..

Free parking also available"}
