{"text":"What a gem!  Staff was very helpful and accommodating as we were going to the State Theater and DID not have reservations! Four of us sat at the bar and were treated like royalty.  There were so many delicious items on the menu.  the homemade rolls with three choices for dripping or spreading were super. I had the ahi tuna which was melt in your mouth. Overall a fabulous experience, remember to get reservations IF you want a table before a show."}
{"text":"Great addition to theater district dining options!  Our party of 4 chose District for dinner before seeing Guys and Dolls at the Hanna...what a great decision!  Their wine list needs updating (they didn't have the vintage we preferred on the 1st wine we picked, but our 2nd choice of wine ended up being even better) and the manager came to the table, opened the wine and welcomed us.  The menu is nice...not too many items so they can do a manageable number of salads/appetizers/entrees/desserts very well. We all had salads which were all very good, though the 'beet & apple' salad was really light on the dressing (we asked for additional) and the goat cheese promised was really 'blue'.  Everyone in our group enjoyed our entrees...Lamb Ossobuco, Angel Hair Strogonoff, and Striped Sea Bass.  All VERY good...nothing left behind!  We skipped dessert and opted for ice wine, port and hand-pressed coffee.  All-in-all a nice way to end our meal.  Service was good, but a little 'off'.  A 'no ice' water request from one of our group seemed to confuse our server and she kept trying to pour 'just water' from a pitcher full of ice water.  Service seemed to slow up a bit at the end and we had to wait for our check, but we had plenty of time to walk across the street to the Hanna in time for curtain.  District has only been open a little over a month and need to work out some kinks, but it definitely has promise.  Make reservations...once word gets out I predict this will be the 'go to' restaurant in the theater 'District'!"}
{"text":"This place is closed. Has been for a while. Has since reopened under new management with a new name: Mazz Bistro (still Japanese food)."}
{"text":"Great Sushi place!  The decor is dramatic, the vibe is perfect.  It's a nice, intimate place where the service is great and the sushi is good quality.    I've been here twice.  The last time I went, we were a party of four.  I made reserations on Yelp which was easy and very helpful as I didn't have to call around for a place to eat on a Saturday night.  I will definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"My parents, husband, son and I were visiting from St. Louis and decided to try this new spot at the recommendation of a friend.  We were so happy we did!  When we walked in we were immediately greeted by the bartender and host.  We started with drinks at the well appointed bar.  I had a cucumber martini that was refreshing and nicely poured.  Everyone else had a glass of wine from their well thought out wine list.    We were seated in a round booth near the windows where we enjoyed watching the theater crowd gather.  This place is literally right across the street from the theater.  Great location for pre-show dinner or after dinner dessert/coffee/drinks.  We noticed a patio that wasn't open yet, but looked like it was under construction.  Would love to sit outside next time!  We chose a few appetizers to start and were pleasantly surprised at the flavor and perfect portions.  I'm not usually a fan of pate, but my husband insisted and I could have eaten the entire plate.  The carpaccio and tuna was also very fresh and tasty.  For dinner I decided to get adventurous tried the goose confit and it was amazing!  Again, perfect portions and done very nicely.  My father (who is a very picky eater) had the beef stroganoff and said it was the best he ever tasted.  The server was friendly, knowledgeable and not pushy or pretentious.  We watched as the manager (who we found out later was the owner) checked on tables, corked wine, and helped servers as things got busy.  You can tell a lot of care has been put into making this restaurant a friendly, fine dining experience and the staff really enjoy working here.    If I had to find anything negative about this place it would be the current filming situation going on in Cleveland.  The road closures made it a little difficult to find (certainly not their fault).  I'm guessing once the movies are over, this place is going to be slammed as more and more people hear about it.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"While our service was good and the staff was beyond friendly and accommodating, our food just wasn't great. I had fish that tasted like nothing, and the person I was with had extremely salty lamb. The salads were very good, but for the price of the entrees it just wasn't worth it. The restaurant could also benefit from having a better atmosphere. It's just tables and bare walls, with no bar scene.   There are just so many fabulous places to go downtown. Unfortunately we will not be going back, despite the convenience to Playhouse Square."}
{"text":"Intimate. Friendly service. Amazing portions on soups and edemame. Rolls were so yummy.  Haven't been there? Then go already."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to District twice and both times we've left with positive experiences. The pricing is slightly on the higher side, but the ingredients used seem to be quite fresh. They do tend to put a \"teriyaki\" sauce on all their rolls but I'm sure you can ask them not to put it on.  The owner has always been very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I had heard about the opening of this restaurant and was so excited that there was another option in the theater district.  We have spent a lot of time here over the last 25 years, and there has not always been a nice variety of restaurants.  We have always stopped in Tremont or Ohio City first for dinner or drinks.    First the sign for the restaurant was great and easy to find....the front door not so much.  That needs to be addressed.  Last night they decided to just prop it open.  We watched people pass it by and then turn around.  I'm not sure how to fix that but...street level sign maybe?  The bar is tiny and situated strangely in the restaurant.  The whole layout is quite strange.  The bar does not really invite you in!  They have an interesting menu and drink and wine list.  The bartenders initially were quite attentive...we did have to ask for bread, clean plates, new silverware, and motion for a second drink.  It seemed like the 2 of them were not quite in sync.  I have seen one bartender tend a larger bar and restaurant much more effectively.  Perhaps that will come in time!  The Manhattans were good.  They had one of my favorite wines too!  Now to the food....well the tapenade/flavored butter for the warm roll was great and flavorful...best part of the whole experience.  The olive oil with 2 rosemary sprigs in had no real flavor.  We ordered mussels which were cooked just right.  We then had goat cheese stuffed calamari.....short on the cheese and very little flavor.  I wanted to just cover the tempura batter in salt.  I believe it was slightly under fried as it had a mushy quality to it.  We then had the ahi tuna....nicely prepared and flavored.  I keep trying all these restaurants in this district and have yet to find one that is worth returning to....I like to spend my money and calories wisely.  We will keep looking!"}
{"text":"We came to District to see the Nutcracker at 7:00. We arrived at 5:40 and both ordered steak. I ordered medium-rare, and my girlfriend ordered medium. My NY Strip came out medium well, and my girlfriend's Delmonico came out rare. Not only that, but her steak was 3/4 fat and the \"roasted\" potatoes were gritty, flavourless, and tasted microwaved.   Our waitress came by and noticed how rare the steak was, so she took it back and said she'd be back soon with a new one. It ended up taking half an hour or more for the fresh steak to come out, at which point I'd already finished my meal.   When the new steak came out, it too was an inedible lump of fat and gristle (see picture). Overall, the Delmonico meal was inedible and disgusting. The only edible part was the chimichurri sauce. The NY Strip was decent.  The wait staff was friendly and apologetic, but the food was poorly prepared and slow to arrive. The staff was nice enough to reduce the bill from $65 to $31."}
{"text":"Mediocre fare, good service DOESN'T LIKE IT DINER REVIEW * MAY 12, 2013 Alas, our high hopes for a good pre-Aziz Ansari meal were quickly destroyed! The salad was far from fresh, the broccoli soup was quite good, the lentil falafel portion was way too big and poorly presented. A pedestrian quiche by any other name is still just that...calling it a vegetarian tarte did not make it special. The only redeeming quality was that the service was very good. Now if only the kitchen could step up their game...if they have it that is, this place may rise above the level of a mediocre restaurant that belongs in a mall, not in the theatre district."}
{"text":"Went here after seeing Dave Chapelle, around 9pm on a Wednesday. Place was about 20% occupied and the bar filled up a little after we got there.  The good: Large, fairly priced wine list. The Justin cab was the best thing on our table.  The bad: The food was bland, uninspired and unoriginal. The chef must have something against vegetables because all the ones that showed up on our plate were murdered by overcooking.  For appetizers, we ordered the crispy asparagus and 4 cheese stuffed mushroom. The asparagus were oily, unseasoned and far from crispy. The place gets a second star because they took this off the bill after we told them. The mushrooms were better, but nothing special -- basic button mushrooms, mostly bleu cheese, watery red sauce with some wilted, undressed lettuce on the side.  For dinner, she had the vegetable lasagna, which was mushy but at least had some flavor.  I had the sole. Again, oily and bland; not a fresh piece of fish. Served on a bed of what was supposed to be risotto, but tasted like the boiled rice concoction my mom used to make me when I had an upset stomach. I opted for haricot vert and brussels sprouts on the side. These were the wimpiest beans I've ever seen, and I was able to squish the sprouts with the back of my fork.  We spent $120 and had to go elsewhere to finish eating because both plates went back over half full. The only plus was we got drunk on the wine a little quicker thanks to our empty stomachs.  I see that this place has some positive reviews from a year or more ago. I guess it's just gone downhill. Save yourself the trouble and just go to Cowell and Hubbard. For the prices you'll pay here, you can get a great meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"The first thought that hits you when you enter Sushi District is \"did I just step into a bar?\"  The decor is definitely not one of your regular sushi places.  There is a long bar on one side of the room and limited seating in the remaining space.    Swallowing my apprehension about being in a bar and not a sushi restaurant, we sit down.  The menu is limited for a typical Japanese place.  The most interesting items were located in the appetizer sections of the menu and we ordered quite a few of these - the salmon tartar, sweet potato wedges, soft shell crabs.  We also ordered the premium sushi plate and then, at the end, vegetable yaki udon.  Yes, it was quite a bit of food, but we wanted to try a whole range of items from the restaurant.    Our conclusion?  Better than average, although not enough to make this place a 4 star despite the decor.  The salmon tartar was yummy and the salmon fresh and creamy.  The soft shell crabs were well done, although I've had better at places like Japango - I felt the crab was a little too large and battered especially around the legs.  The sweet potato wedges were lovely.  The sushi plate was average, unfortunately.  The rice was a bit too packed and sweet.  The Yakiudon was good but nothing special.  My partner found it a little too sweet.    For the quality of the food, I felt that the price was a little bit too high - not exorbitant, but too high if you're looking for a good place to eat and don't care about the decor.  I suppose the decor justifies the extra $$ in some people's books, but it's not what I generally look for when i eat sushi.    The best thing about the restaurant was the service.  Our waitress was very attentive and pleasant.  She delivered water to the table without asking when she heard me cough, and she was cheerful and helpful about the menu.  Excellent service with a smile."}
{"text":"A must see!  I've dined here with clients for lunch, drank with my boss and my coworkers for happy hour and have eaten with my best friend for dinner.  Each time I've come in, I'm treated as a \"familiar face\" and am greeted by name.  My lunch server had an extensive knowledge of the menu, was very professional and excused herself each time she came to the table to fill our drinks (and I drink a TON of water).  The tuna appetizer is breath-taking, the sandwiches (excuse me, grinders) are fantastic and I'm still working my way down the menu to get to anything with angel hair pasta, like the stroganoff and the seafood entree.  And they have Wienerschnitzel!  At happy hour, the bar snacks are brought out of the kitchen hot and delicious and the bartenders don't skimp of the cocktail knowledge.  And unless my server has a twin, she is also a bartender.  We ordered five of their signature drinks and watched the (Bruce Willis & Thandie Newton) duo behind the bar mix and pour and shake and set (like clockwork) drinks in front of us that were visually stimulating and delicious!  What a connection from first pour to last!  I would suggest making dinner reservations, as this restaurant is new and across the street from an upcoming condo renovation.  The appetizers, entrees and desserts all compliment each other.  I literally went with whatever the specials were, because our server, Chris (spot on with detail), recommended we should.  My date ordered a salad and surf and turf.  Deliciously cooked veal!  And of course, we tried dessert.    The service at this place is incredible!  Very professional, extremely filled with knowledge and attentive to their guests needs.  Needless to say, I will be back and so will my colleagues. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to Playhouse Square.  My husband and I had a wonderful dining experience there this evening before seeing Guys and Dolls at the Hanna.  We enjoyed the wine flight recommended by our waiter.  My salmon was excellent as was my husband's steak/scallop entree.    Kudos to Eric the personable manager and his very attentive staff."}
{"text":"This place is pricy but has really, really good sushi and great drinks. I'm from Vancouver and I always have sticker shock anywhere else when I buy sushi. At least at this place I felt like I got my money's worth."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night before Playhouse Square with a group of 8.   Without prompting, the server asked what time we needed to be at the event.  Everyone in our group enjoyed our meals.  Service was good, and we had plenty of time."}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner there last night.  My dish (Brisket) I ordered it without the sauerkraut was one of the best meals I have ordered out in a long time.  One lady had carrots which were out of this world.  The waitress said they were made with blue cheese.  And desert, a cheesecake was excellent.    The only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating was the restaurant was busy (it was before a show) and our waitress was pleasant but very rushed.  They needed someone to help her."}
{"text":"Sept 28, 2013 - District appears to be closed. I booked a reservation thru Open Table, but when I showed up it wasn't open. There was a Dinesafe card that said that they were closed for a few days in mid-Aug (not sure if they opened back up after that). There was a pile of mail in the door, and their website is now down."}
{"text":"We had a party of 6 for dinner and had to make sure to get out for a 7:30PM curtain (like everyone else, I'm sure).  I had the aviation cocktail which was yummy.  The drinks did take a long while to come out though (including our 2nd round of drinks).  Their rolls are good, but you have to ask for more.  Cowell and Hubbard just come by with more bread.  I ordered the goose confit with red wine cranberry sauce and potato puree.  It was good but needed a bit more sauce.  The other folks had angel hair stroganoff, lentil falafel and chicken breast entrees.  Everyone finished their plates.  Our waitress was great...(even when we asked for separate checks).  District is a great addition to the theatre district.  I would rate it a close second to Cowell and Hubbard.  I'll definitely be back.  I'm sure they're still adjusting to the timing issues of dinner before a show.  I'm sure they'll improve."}
{"text":"Absolutely sublime!  One of the best hidden gems for a bite in Playhouse Square. The atmosphere is wonderful, the food is delicious and best of all it is very reasonably priced.   I had the wienerschnitzel with mashed potatoes and chimichurri sauce and it was spectacular. I also had the Belgian chocolate ganache and that was excellent as well. The staff is friendly and very helpful, the decor is elegant but not stuffy.   Will definitely place this in my lunch rotation!"}
{"text":"I just have to say that the staff went above and beyond for us at District. I was traveling for business with a group and we had a long evening with no opportunity for dinner until after an event, so we rolled in rather late. They welcomed us just as they were thinking of closing (and even sat another couple after us). And yet our waiter never rushed us and was friendly and fun through the whole evening. I can't speak for the others in my group for their food, but when our waiter declared the goose the best thing on the menu, I went for it and it did not disappoint. I was far too full for desert, but I did have a yummy bite of the apple crumble. It was a great autumnal meal. The fact that they pulled together a lovely, atmospheric evening for us in a nearly empty restaurant, right before closing, says a lot to me about how dedicated this staff is. Thank you for a lovely end to a long day of work and travel!"}
{"text":"Great place. Delicious food and friendly staff. It's a perfect spot for Leslieville.  The prices are reasonable and everything that I have tried is delicious.  They have a mackerel app that they put a flame to right at your table that you should try."}
{"text":"Bland flavor, overcooked rice, dirty tables, and dirty walls."}
{"text":"If you're going to have California style Japanese food this is the place to do it.  Hipster atmosphere and great California rolls."}
{"text":"Problems at many levels. Starting with drinks, they have 4-5 draft beers and they were out of the two good ones, including GLBC Conway's, which just came out. Also such an inconsistent pour on two different glasses of wine that we had to ask why, and they said they have a small and a large glass, which seemed odd and I don't think it's in the menu but we took their word for it. Bread was good, not good that it was the best part. The biggest problem was the long wait for food that wasn't hot. A diabetic member of a party had to ask for more bread to stop from crashing due to the wait, and then wasn't able to eat the $26 plate when it arrived. Waiter was apologetic but no interaction with management. The chicken teriyaki I had was supposed to come with rice pilaf and mixed veggies but it looked like plain white rice to me, and it was a full stir fry which I wasn't expecting based on the menu. It tasted ok but the meal overall reminded me of the Japanese place at the mall that hands out samples all day. They also only have one stall for women, so my wife had to wait forever to use the washroom. Overall, very disappointed and won't go back. Head across the street or to 4th street if you want a nice experience before a show."}
{"text":"I've tried this restaurant 3 times this theater season with a group. It has not been good anytime. The service is fine but the food quality has declined. My prime rib last night was tough while others said their meals were mediocre. It used to be full before theater but there were only 4-5 tables last night. I really enjoyed it the first year they were open. Sad to say but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious and close to home! The beef enoki rolls were very tasty, as was the red dragon roll. My friend ordered the tuna tuna roll which she loved (I wasnt crazy about it). We shared a spicy roll, which has a bit too much spicy mayo on top but I thought was very tasty.   Despite only one person working the full restaurant, we were well served never finding ourselves waiting or wondering where our food was. Granted, it's a small east end spot, but still.   Dinner came to $70 for the above plus the large house sake, tax and tip. Definitely will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Great staff that made sure we were taken care of and made sure we made our play on time. Highly recommend especially if you are attending the Playhouse Square father dinner."}
{"text":"Just had another great meal at District Bistro. It's been a few months since the first time and they don't seize to amaze me. Unlike most restaurants that do well in the first few months then drop their quality, their menu has expanded into more flavourful items. I enjoyed the soft shell crab appetizer the most this time around. Keep up the great food and service District Bistro!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner at sushi district - all I can say is that it's the best sushi I've had in the city.... Seriously great!  Fresh, and beautifully presented and quite innovative.   Friends of mine have been raving about it and happy to say they were right. I will definitely be coming back weekly."}
{"text":"Stopped for an early evening dinner and was not disappointed. Seared tuna was perfect. Barramundi was excellent with lemon sauce. Crab cakes and falafel also tasty. Excellent presentation of the meals. Would definitely return for another dinner."}
{"text":"Food rating - 4 stars Service rating - zero stars Therefore the average rating of 2 stars!  This used to be one of my favourite restaurants in the neighbourhood, until our visit a few days ago. It was a beautiful summer evening and my party of 6 chose to sit outside on the patio, which was nice, although we were sitting on a picnic table. I had made a note in my OpenTable reservation that we would need 3 cheques (for 3 couples) and reminded them of that fact when we were being seated. To start they were short of menus and so took some from our table, which was fine since a one couple was late. However the server didnt notice that when we were seated there were not enough plates and cutlery for our group of 6. I ended up getting a set of chopsticks and a soy-sauce dish when I went to use the restroom. When the final members of our group arrived the waitress did not ask for their drink order and seemed annoyed that we had waited for them to order our meals (even though the rest of us had already ordered drinks and appetizers and the restaurant was not that busy).  We all ordered mains except for one person ordered a salad and maki rolls for dinner. The waitress did not ask her if she wanted her salad with the mains with everyone or wanted it first. They brought out the one salad first and my friend had the willpower to keep from eating it while we all waited for our food. A few people ordered the sushi & sashimi combo which was apparently good (I've had it before and its been good). With pregnancy restrictions I was limited to cooked food, which I didnt think would be a problem since my favourite item on their menu has always been the 'crunchy lime salmon.' However, the portion seems to have gotten smaller (and no its not just because I'm pregnant, my husband thought so too!).   It took an extremely long time to get the waitress' attention after our mains were cleared. Finally, I ordered an extra roll since I was still hungry, one couple ordered a dessert and another person ordered another drink. The dessert came right away, the drink took quite a while and my roll never came. Eventually (when the place was almost empty) the waitress told me that I could still get my roll or I could cancel. At that point I wasn't going to make everyone wait and watch me eat so I cancelled it. Which means they let a pregnant woman go hungry (bad move!) and didn't even acknowledge their mistake or try to correct it in any way (perhaps giving me a roll to go, dessert etc).   Finally, when it came to the bill, the waitress actually asked members of the party of tell her what everyone had ordered so she could split it. This is despite the 2 reminders before we ordered about the request for a separate bill per couple and only having 6 people in the party (having worked in restaurants I know its not that complicated it you simply keep track of what everyone orders).  And then they gave us a hard time because I had a WagJag voucher, which should be simple enough. Initially they were not going to even accept it (for no good reason) and when my husband inquired further they finally did, but were rather rude about it.   Overall everyone in the group enjoyed the food but personally I was embarrassed about how terrible the service was as my husband and I had picked the restaurant and recommended it to the others. This used to be one of my favourite restaurants in the city and I've brought friends here on several occasions. I doubt that I will be returning again. Too bad."}
{"text":"First time going and we had a mediocre experience.   The hostess was very rude and exclaimed how busy they were (as an excuse for her rudeness).  No one waiting and tables were 80% filled.  Not my idea of busy.  So once again, Restaurant Managers listen up...Stop hiring inexperienced hostesses. Its not McDonalds.  They are the first impression. And she was terrible and rude. They forget that I am about to spend over $150 on a single dining experience!  Listen to me, accommodate a simple table seating request.  Food was bland...missing flavor and , again mediocre.  Meh.  Perhaps I'll try them again someday.  But not on my list of repeats."}
{"text":"Ate here Friday for the first time. Very good service, great drinks, and good food. As we were going to see a show after they were very fast and got us out in plenty of time! Cant wait to go again"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Nice view at window seats. Salmon and trout were excellent. Emptied out at showtime which is fine! Wine list reasonable"}
{"text":"Delicious.  Contemporary presentation of traditional American and international favorites w an artistic twist. Ran, the chef, takes things in new, yet familiar directions. Simple, easy to nav menu with something for everyone.  Great before a show at Playhouse Square.  The acoustics, unfortunately, will prepare you for the large theater crowds."}
{"text":"I was at District again tonight to celebrate my birthday!  I've been here a few times and both the food and the service are always outstanding. Three people at the table had the angle hair stroganoff which looked awesome.  I had the sea food and gnocchi dish and loved it.  There weren't any shows playing tonight so there were a handful of other tables - which was nice because we could take our time.  If you're coming to see a show make sure you make a reservation!  And thanks for a great birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"More a public service announcement than a review: I was going to reserve for dinner here to use up a Groupon - I'd been looking up another restaurant in the area that looks very dodgy from the outside on the City of Toronto Dinesafe food inspection website (ironically, that place has a good inspection record), and randomly noticed that District was coded \"red\". It was closed for two days last week (Aug 13) for serious violations of basic food safety rules, like failing to provide handwashing supplies. I called Groupon and got a credit refund.    I think raw fish and \"gross unsanitary conditions\" (for which it was closed) is a recipe for disaster and other things being with a \"d\". It reopened after another inspection but personally I rather eat where the management seem to take sanitation more seriously. A full on closure by the city is a pretty serious step."}
{"text":"This place is high end in terms of prices. The ambiance is chic, modern which is rare amongst the common sushi restaurants. We came to try out the place with a groupon and ended up getting 4 specialty rolls which came up to $63 including tax and tip. With the groupon we got a $40 deduction however for the amount of food we received it was pricy. The maki favourites were all pretty good however none were outstanding and did not justify their elevated prices. Recommendations get only the favourites on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place was great. The ambience is intimate and laid back. It was so different from most sushi places, but in a very good way.  We ordered the salmon sashimi, and some specialy maki rolls. They were all delicious! We specially enjoyed the District roll, Spicy roll and Red Dragon roll. All so fresh and delicious.    Our server was great. She was pleasant and attentive. I will definetly go back to this place again and again."}
{"text":"We dined there on Thursday before the play, Eric suggested that I try the Goose Confetti.  It was fantastic, I have never had goose before and I was very pleased with my meal. My wife had the Ribeye another great meal. Definitely give this place a look.  Howard"}
{"text":"Really a 2.5 but I'll round up here. Went in at 8:00 on a Saturday night and it was DEAD - maybe 4-5 other customers.  The restaurant is very modestly decorated.  Actually, pretty boring for a 'hot spot' in the middle of Playhouse Square. We had a reservation, but obviously didn't need it, so we just sat at the bar.  The food was above average - had the salmon and sea bass entrees. Both were well prepared and served quickly.  Also, had the asparagus app and it was darn good. The bartender was busy doing other things so our service was pretty average.  That, and her (apparent) boyfriend was at the bar with cough drops sprawled out all over the bar in front of him.  She was pretty responsive to him, so yet again our service suffered. All in all a decent experience but nothing I'd rush back to."}
{"text":"Excellent grouper dinner, delightful ambience right in the theater district. Highly recommend this restaurant before or after the theater."}
{"text":"My wife, another couple and I went to District last weekend before going to see Wicked. We arrived at 5:45 for our reservation, in plenty of time for a 7:30 show start. Our server never came to the table, so after 15 minutes of chatting, we went to hostess to tell her. Our server came over right away then, but she was clearly in the weeds. She was not rude, but not overly sorry or apologetic for the delay. We ordered cocktails and apps, the calamari, which were very good and timely. Then she disappeared for a long while. Then, finally, we ordered the entrees. We had the salmon, the filet special and our friends shared a wedge salad and the seafood risotto. The food took a long time and came out, and when it did, was luke warm at best. The manager offered to re-fire the entrees, which we took advantage of. More time. At about 7:00, he brought us comp'd desserts. Nice, but not needed. He didn't offer or ask us if we wanted them. We would have rather just had my wife's salmon comp'd because she didn't eat it, even after a re-fire. The food had good taste, but just wasn't hot. After the delays, our server brought the bill, which was divided completely wrong. We pointed out the errors and she was off to correct. Now, 7:20, so our wives left to get to the show and we stayed to pay and rush to the show. Our server returned and the bills were still wrong. At this point, we just paid as we were going to be late for the show. We ended up missing the entry time and the first 12 minutes of Wicked due to this. I would put 100% of this on the service. All of the delays and cold food was due to our server. The location is great and food has potential, but I think I'll wait a good while before going back, if at all. Too many other great places in the area to endure another disappointment with poorly trained servers."}
{"text":"Average experience.  Sat outside on the patio which was nice. But you had to walk past the garbage and recycling to get out there.   We ordered the tuna tartar which was delicious, served with yam tempura. The red dragon roll and the spicy roll was okay. They was soggy and overpowered with sauce. We had the fried banana and red bean Ice cream which was good.   The bill came to a little less than $50. I had a groupon for this place, so that made it worth it."}
{"text":"It was fine. there was nothing really wrong with the food at District. The rating is for the fact that there was nothing \"wow\" about it. They have the same sushi rolls, maki, tempura, sashimi etc that you can find at the majority of the sushi places in this town. Did they do it any better than the other places? No, not really. Don't get me wrong, it was good sushi but nothing that made me go.....\"yeah, I need to come back here\". It was pricey and it was just your basic-can-of-corn sushi. The service was really great, attentive. It is a nice place. The back patio was quite lovely, nice and cozy."}
{"text":"We used a groupon and were pleasantly surprised!! The best sushi I've ever had in TO. The tuna tartar is amazing!!!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times, and the service is always excellent, the food was always good. After coming by for dinner before a show (it's an easy walk to the theaters across the street) this time I can say the service was excellent and the food less than good.  The ahi tuna was tough. The Caesar salad was mediocre. The pasta dish boring. The blueberry lemonade martini was fantastic.  For the prices here, they need to fix what went wrong with the food."}
{"text":"The wait staff was very good. Fast friendly service. The coffee was excellent. They bring the French press to the table and make it fresh for you. The food over all was ok. At $30 per person I would have expected a bit better. I had the pan seared sole and the shrimp bisque. The sole seemed like it may have been microwaved and was over seasoned. The bisque was ok as well. Just nothing extremely great about either dish. The other members in my party had the same experience."}
{"text":"The servers are nice, but just untrained or something.  They're well intentioned but somehow it takes a lot to get their attention and they use a lot of what we would call \"wasted movement\".  Example: bringing water out to a table, and not filling up others' water. Every trip was for 1 thing only, like they were working for a union or paid by the trip between front & back of house. Coming by to check on us, but not clearing plates.  Service aside, the food there is fantastic. Pricey, but fantastic. We didn't order very much to start, but we ended up being fuller than expected.  We ordered an extra roll, and that did it. It's pricier than your plain old mid-grade places, but you'll get better food.  Music: loud. Not super loud, but if they turned it down a bit, the diners I'm sure would actually enjoy their experience much more.  We would go again, the food was that good."}
{"text":"Nice place, great service. Sushi was average. Nothing too wowing. But all in all a nice place to have a drink with friends."}
{"text":"District  Damp napkin? Table stable with cardboard Came back to confirm salads then only brought one. Cancelled the forgotten one.  All tables equipped with candles yet none lit One of us missing the soy sauce ramekin Charged us for two salads (see above)  Yummy hot saki Cool decor Fabulous rolls  If you don't mind the trainwreck of a waitstaff, definitely a place to treat your sushi-tooth."}
{"text":"I hate writing poor reviews because I've worked in the restaurant industry and I know what a grind it can be... but this was just extremely disappointing. My parents, in-laws, my wife and I went to dinner last night at District before all the parents went to see a play. I had been to District in the past and was not impressed, but the new menu looked promising and my father in law has a terrible back (can't walk far to the theater) so we figured we'd give it a shot. Big mistake.  It wasn't just that the food was poorly prepared (my steak was borderline mushy and my wife's tuna was very over cooked), it was also the fact that we were rushed by our waitress. I get it-- District makes its money on the weekend with the theatre crowd so it behooves them to get people in and out in time for the shows. But between food, drinks and tip, the 6 of us dropped over $500. You could spend the same at Morton's, Red or several other upscale restaurants downtown. Trust me... this was not a Morton's experience.  I'm sure District will continue to get plenty of business because of their proximity to the theaters-- also their immediate competition in Playhouse Square i.e. Cowell & Hubbard and Cibreo, are nothing to write home about. So District will probably keep going through the motions and be just fine. But that's unfortunate... for that price point, you would expect so, so much more."}
{"text":"GREAT food! Easy reservations made on open table, food was really good! The lentil falafel and the beet salad was great! Our waitress was really friendly. Went before a show and they were quick with service and entrees. DEF will go back!"}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped in here before a show when both Cowell & Hubbard and Cibreo were full. The atmosphere is nice, we took two seats at the bar. Our bartender was lovely, very attentive and friendly. We did not have much time before the show, so we ordered one of their 'slow cooked' beef entrees. I think this is a genius idea since they likely get a lot of people that are short on time. It came right out and was tasty. We also ordered two salads, the lentil and chickpea salad was bland and way under seasoned, almost as if they forgot to add any salt/pepper/vinegar to the dressing. I still ate it though, the lettuce was crisp and it was a good portion size. The beet salad was very good. We were able to get in a full meal in a hurry and were on to our show in no time. I also thought the bread service with trio of spreads was nice."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. Went here before seeing a show at the Playhouse and was expecting better. I got the strip steak which was cooked very well but I was disappointed because the broccoli served with it was way over cooked (barely had color) and it was obviously frozen. My mom said her brussel sprouts tasted frozen also but my dads asparagus was fresh so that was confusing. Both said that all the fish meals they've had there previously were delicious and my dads salmon was good.  However, the fire and ice dessert was tiny. They gave a lot of ice cream but the cake was very small. The chocolate ganache was good and the raspberry sauce was delicious but it came with a chocolate covered rice crispy treat which was good at first but then I got to a different size and it was frozen and hurt to bite--weird. Overall, just kinda hit and miss with this one."}
{"text":"It was good, basically, it is a place people go before shows.  We got there at 7:15 on a cold Saturday night, it was packed.  By 7:35, we were literally the only table with people eating.  Food was a 7/10, atmosphere was a 6, service was a 6 and price/portion was a 7.  I wasn't blown away, expected to be more happy about the entree and the Cleveland onion soup was very salty.  Good, but more salt than I wanted.  Nice addition to the restaurant scene.  I wanted to mention that our server was busy at first when we were seated.  The manager came by and filled our waters, got us started on bread and talked to us.  He was extremely welcoming, conversationally entertaining and friendly (made up the difference between 3-4 stars).  Wine list ranged from $26- around $200, seemed to have something for nearly everyone."}
{"text":"Went there before a show. Service rushed as the calamari came before drinks. Crab cakes were a pile of mush. Service uninspiring. Plenty of other choices around the square."}
{"text":"Another homerun visit to District. Had a business meeting there, had 2 appetizers an 2 desserts to share, Apple and beet salad and calamari appetizers were great. Chocolate molten lava cake and creme brule desserts were also great. My guest loved the wine (I wouldn't know anything about it, not a big drinker). We were so impressed with it that we are bringing a networking event of 50+ppl there in 3 weeks time. Management extremely helpful!"}
{"text":"District is a great place for quiet, intimate dinner for lovers or small groups. Food is pretty good, flavours and presentation included. We tried the tuna tartar (delicious), as well as miso-glazed white fish (good texture, taste ok) and a pretty standard sushi/sashimi plate. Their sauces are magical, plates beautifully presented and staff is polite. All in all a good experience, although the bill was...a tad expensive. 80$ for two people, including drinks."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at District before a show at Playhouse Square.  We all enjoyed our meals -- salmon, steak, and beef brisket -- as well as an appetizer of arancini.  It's a perfect location to dine before a show.  And the waiter asked us before he took our order is we were going to Playhouse Square so that he could make sure we were done in time.  The service was very good.  My only complaint is the decor.  It's a little minimal and seemed \"cold\" but, given how tasty the food was, it certainly won't stop me from returning."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant in a good location if you're going to be near CSU or the theater. Super nice and welcoming bartender and waitstaff. Drinks were good but not strong. The barramundi and the steak were good but not the best I've had by far. Great for groups!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time for takeout. The staff is super adorable and friendly. Best avocado roll in the city.  It's large & stuffed to the brim with the perfect ratio of avocado to sticky rice. Their salmon tartare is also very good. Love the 5-spice sauce."}
{"text":"Delicious food and fantastic service!  A friend and I were trawling the Queen East strip, looking for a light dinner, when we found this place. It looked really cool, great artwork, beautiful marble tables and old school movies projected onto a black wall.  We were greeted by the owner (I think) and seated at a table by the window. The seating was leather banquets, which I really really liked.  The owner was super friendly and really helpful. She explained that it was tapas-style Japanese food, and welcomed us to ask her any questions.  Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious... beef enoki rolls, blue ocean maki and the rainbow roll. The fish was really fresh, and the prices were pretty good considering the amount of food you got.  I will definitely return if I'm in the area and looking for some high-end sushi without the price or pretention."}
{"text":"Dined at District and everything was outstanding!  The District Sidecar is one of the best I have had.  And I had the soup and the Angel Hair Stroganoff which was amazing.  Everyone at our table really enjoyed their meals.  The owner stopped by and was delightful.  This will be a lunch and pre-show spot!"}
{"text":"Had a brunch meeting here. The service is great along with the food. The prices are reasonable as well. They even adjusted their menu to my allergies which I appreciate very much. Overall my experience here was great."}
{"text":"Great choice if your in the theater district!!! Staff very friendly! Food was great! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Do you know what average is .. This is average .. The tastiest dish on the menu .. Out of.  The steak I had .. Ok quality ... No seasoning  .. The sentiment around the table \"this is nothing\". Walk around the corner to Cowell & Hubbard .. Way way better"}
{"text":"I came to District with a Groupon (meal for 2 including sake pairings with each course for $49).  This included choice of miso soup/edamame, and choice of maki.  We were a party of 3, so we also ordered some things a la carte.    The first thing you'll notice about District is the décor.  It reminds you of an uber-chic (not to mention uber-expensive) sushi joint in Manhattan.  Definitely not your usual kimono-wearing, bamboo-clad sushi joint (which is why they charge you the $$$$).  The space is pretty small and we were crammed into a nook tucked behind the main window.  Lucky we're all pretty average in size because a larger person would be spilling over the table.    The sushi here is pretty standard although they throw in a few curve balls with cream cheese appearing in the signature District Roll and for the vegetarians, the Green Ocean Roll (avocado, cucumber and wakame) is a pretty tasty bet.  Their assorted sashimi (18 pcs) for $20 is quite a good deal.    I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here for sushi, but if you're in the 'hood it's a nice place to enjoy a leisurely meal."}
{"text":"I've only myself to blame for not paying more attention to other Yelpers' reviews.  I'll start with the end and say that the waitress went above and beyond when she arranged to have my steak comped and then followed up with a free dessert.  So that's the good news.  I ordered the ahi tuna appetizer, a glass of wine, and the steak au poivre.  The tuna was served with pickled pumpkins which was odd and did nothing for me in terms of complimenting the fish.  Almost like having a helping of butternut squash--why?  Accompanying the tuna were toasted garlic crostini and I believe the tuna had a dash of white truffle oil on it.  The latter coupled with the crostini was a bit overwhelming for the delicate fish.  So points for originality, but that doesn't mean it always works.  Apparently they haven't changed meat suppliers from when earlier reviewers were there.  The strip steak was the grisliest piece of meat I've had in a long time and the broccoli was seriously overdone.  The mashed potatoes were tasty and quite filling.  I'm sad this place was such a disappointment.  The prices are fair and its location obviously makes it attractive as the dining room what chock full of pre-theater patrons.  I'm hoping that they'll turn it around.  It's got to be tough on the staff when they work hard to do their bit but are tasked with serving what the kitchen puts out."}
{"text":"The sushi woe, is a story I know far to well in the city of Toronto. I think Toronto should go down in history for having the most sushi restaurants per square foot in one city that are for the most part, disappointing.   I've walked by District about 100 times, always curious as to what it was, assuming it was some French Italian fusion bistro. One fateful evening on a Monday I was hungry for sushi. My favorite place was closed and we had exhausted all other places. My partner told me about a place in Riverdale called District that he heard was really good from colleagues. I decided to take the risk and give it a try. Pulling up I was shocked to see that the District I had walked by so many times was a sushi restaurant. Not only was it a sushi restaurant, it was a damn good one too.  The place is very modern and trendy with paintings and photographs of local artist hanging on the walls. Service was top notch. A young lady from Australia who was very cheerful and helpful with suggestions. We ordered a slew of things. Salmon Tartare, Magura Salad, Sushi Pizza (best one I ever had), Tuna Tuna Maki and District Maki. Both were unbelievable. Fish is incredibly fresh and the flavors are perfectly balanced and don't over power the taste of the fish.  After sharing a Sapporo I would call it the perfect evening. I was happy to find another sushi joint to put on my very short list. Excited to go back soon."}
{"text":"Great Food.  Had the double tuna spicy roll... very yummy.  Then a platter of premium nigiri sushi.... it definitely was premium, no fake crab. Terrific atmosphere.  Place was jam packed on a Sat. night, not a single seat available.  One server.  Given what she had to handle she did very well. However, it was a bit on the slow side.  Well worth the visit"}
{"text":"I often order sole when it is on the menu, so I ordered it at District. Well quite honestly, it really did not look or taste like sole to me. My friend said that maybe there are different kinds of sole and that I had never eaten this one before. As far as I was concerned, they gave me a piece of old who knows what kind of fish on a bed of dried risotto.  I will not go back there."}
{"text":"Not much to add, just that it's great.  Fresh, unique, great service."}
{"text":"We have been here twice in the last month and absolutely love it!   Service is outstanding.  Recommend the \"Follow the yellow brick road\" cocktail, Asparagus tempura, Crab stuffed Salmon, and Filet."}
{"text":"A breif synopsis of my evening at District. The menus were tattered.  Sashimi platter, once delivered, was worth the wait.  However, the rolls were too large to be polite.  Enter rice belly.  Service was lukewarm.  Sapporo was cold.  The bill was paid.  We didn't look back."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how great our experience was at District! We were in town for business. Coming from a city known for its amazing food, we honestly weren't expecting much. What a wonderful surprise District was! I had the Falafel, which was a perfectly spicy and flavorful treat. The manager, Eric, was very friendly and offered our table an Apple Pie Moonshine after our meal. The attention to detail and upscale yet friendly environment can not be beat!   Highly recommend District before going to see a show in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I went to District for downtown Cleveland's Restaurant Week. I don't know how it's possible but I had actually never heard of this place before I saw it listed as a participant. If you know me, you know it's almost impossible for me to have not heard of a restaurant in Cleveland. Naturally, I had to check it out.   First off let me just say how pleasantly surprised I was to find they had a vegan appetizer and entrée option for Restaurant Week. I think this was one of like 3 places that actually thought to include a vegan option, so that alone won them serious brownie points with me. On top of that, when I asked our waitress if they would whip me up a vegan dessert instead of one of the ones they had available on their restaurant week menu (neither were vegan) she didn't even hesitate. She really was incredibly accommodating and very thoughtful. She even asked about the bread for me without me even needing to tell her. So nice!!  My meal itself was delicious. I got the lentil spinach soup as an appetizer, and then the lentil \"falafel.\" Apparently, I really like lentils. The food was top notch and without a doubt worth the $30 per person(this included an app, an entrée, and a dessert! Each!)  So, you are probably wondering why they didn't get a solid 5/5. Here is why:  As some others have mentioned, there is a serious draft in this place. If you are sitting anywhere near or around the front door be prepared to get a bone-chilling gust of wind in your face any time that door opens. I had to wear my winter coat the whole dinner it was so freezing.   It does seem to be short-staffed. We personally didn't have any issues with this, our waitress was great about refills, getting our check, etc. It did look however that some tables sat for quite some time without getting much attention. Just something to think about.  Overall a great place to go if you have plans in or around Playhouse. Also, valet is $15 but if you get your ticket validated you get $6 back! Pretty solid deal!"}
{"text":"District, I'm glad to be in your district!  I love the food and vibe...but wouldn't mind a roll-back on the prices.   I've been a couple of times and love their modern, Japanese food.  We always get their beef enoki rolls, salmon salad and an assortment of roles.  All the food is executed well!  The beef enoki rolls are one of the best we've had.  The rolls are always interesting and the fish fresh.    We've tried a couple of the sake cocktails and enjoyed them.  Can't remember the specifics, but I guess that means the drinks were good!    I would recommend the back patio too, which probably sits about 20 people in various small tables for 2-4 people, but makes for a nice place for some al fresco dining!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner before a show at Playhouse Square.  First there's Jared, a completely delightful, engaging, professional waiter.  His service alone earned a great review! Second, there's the warm, fresh rolls...chewy and tasty! Third are the cocktails...well prepared lavender martini was delicious!  Fourth is the food. Each dish was imaginatively plated and cooked to perfection. The lamb shank was melt-in-your-mouth tender with a tasty sauce and the goose confit was amazing! We did not have room for dessert as the portions are generous. Last but not least is the location. ..on East 14th at Playhouse Square so convenient for before or after a show. Try it and ask for Jared!"}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night with a large group. Made reservations for 5:00 in order to have enough time to make a show at the palace. Service was excellent and the food was amazing. Several in our group ordered the flat iron steak (excellent), several ordered vegetarian dishes (excellent), and I had the barramundi (AMAZING). We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to The District prior to a show at Playhouse Square and had a great experience both times.  We ordered the crab bites as an appetizer and they were absolutely delicious!  Our cocktails were also wonderful.  Our waiter, Jeremiah, did a great job taking care of us.  I ordered the Linguine Mediterranean with chicken and when our dinners came out, it was missing the chicken.  I wasn't mad and knew it was just a mistake, but honestly our waiter was AWESOME and went above and beyond fixing the mistake.  The chicken ended up coming out quickly and was delicious.  After dinner, we ordered another cocktail and we were surprised with a creme brulee on the house for the mistake.    I know some people can be difficult if something goes wrong, but I was a bartender for years so I try to be understanding and felt that Jeremiah went above and beyond making sure we were happy.  And we loved the creme brulee!"}
{"text":"Tonight we attended my sister-in-law's wedding reception. I can not begin to tell you how amazing the entire staff was. They put together an amazing menu, and in such a short period of time.  We had David help us with the drink selections. He picked an amazing red cab for me and later on, the Asian Pear (Both a must have) Trust this staff, they know their cocktails and wine.  Now enough about how amazing David was and let us talk about the food! Oh Em Gee! Yes I went there. We started off with the mixed salad and stuffed mushrooms followed by the   salmon & filet. I ordered my filet mid-rare and guess what. It was! The salmon was HUGE. It was hard to say which one was better!  The desserts were yummy. The portion sizes were perfect. My husband and I share everything and we both felt full leaving.   I would totally come back again for dinner or just drinks.  the atmosphere were wonderful and calm. Food and drinks were top rate. Service was perfect! I would recommend a tourist or local to come in for a try!"}
{"text":"My family and I visited this location on New Year's Eve prior to a show (Elf) at Playhouse Square. Jared who I believe is the manager at the location was truly amazing from the point of reservation throughout they meal. Also our waitress was very thorough and helpful as well on menu selections. Our daughters loved their salads and again went above and beyond when my daughter didn't know what type of dressing she'd like and they brought out samplings of each dressing for her which not only put a smile on her face but helped her find the right dressing...which at the end of the day was just the house made balsamic. My wife and I ordered the flank steaks which were just \"ok\", what really bothered me was that thy set the steak on the Parmesan risotto and when you order a medium steak in then turns your white risotto into a reddish/pinkish color which was beyond appetizing and neither of us are it, which surprised us as our waitress didn't ask. Also the desserts were pretty good but very very small for the price. Would I be back for a meal? Doubtful...but maybe drinks before a show and the opportunity to valet park."}
{"text":"This restaurant was the only place open and we had a great time. The staff, food, dessert and pressed coffee were all outstanding. MUST TRY!!! New fav place while visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"Had dinner here before a show at Playhouse recently. Not sure what the negative reviews were all about as I had a wonderful dinner.  Started out with a nectarine and walnut salad with a soy vinaigrette.  I'm not a huge fan of soy sauce, but I was intrigued by this.  It definitely tasted like soy sauce, but somehow the combination with the lettuce and nectarines, it was an interesting savory sweet pairing that challenged by taste buds.  I also had a side of the butternut squash risotto.  It reminded me of a fried rice my mother makes because there were some perfectly cooked sweet onions in there as well. The risotto was more a regular rice in my opinion as it was not as creamy as other risottos I've had. However, the butternut squash was cooked thoroughly and I wanted more once I finished it.  They had some other vegetarian options (soup, several salads, pasta, and a lasagna) so I appreciate that I can return and have variety.  My husband enjoyed a barrumundi fish and there were no complaints there.  We finished our meal with the lava cake dessert. The cake to ice cream portion was not quite right (more ice cream), but just as you see on all the cooking shows on TV, the chocolatey goodness spilled out of the cake like lava.    Service was great too, although we were there a bit earlier on a Sunday evening.   And, as another review comments, yes the walls are quite bare, but it's nice to give our eyes a break from the hustle and bustle of the modern world."}
{"text":"Stopped in before seeing a play at Hanna theater.  Convenient location.  Trout was excellent as was the service.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I go see a show at Playhouse about once a month so I am always looking to try a new restaurant beforehand. Even though we stopped in at 5:30pm on a Saturday I am so glad I made reservations because this place was fully booked. Inside the place looks classy, no issue with decor, but we were seated at the bar and every time someone opened the door we got a burst of cold air.   Our bartender/server kept our glasses filled and got us in and out during our short time frame to dine. For food we decided to try a couple of appetizers. I went with the Fromaggi Arancini $8 and the Baked Cauliflower Souffle $8. My dining companion got a salad, and the scallops. Nothing was bad, but overall I'd say it was underwhelming. I would go back to give them one more try, but I am not in a rush to do so."}
{"text":"Service: 5 stars Bread and various dips: 4 stars Main course: just not good.   I have been here twice. Both times, I got the pear salad (which is highly recommended). Sadly, a salad cannot be the highlight of a meal, so we move to the main course.  The first time I got the lamb osso bucco. I was so excited. And then, so disappointed; it was completely under seasoned and I couldn't finish it. Second time, a few days ago, I went and got the lamb gnocchi. The lamb was hard, chewy, and overcooked. And the meal was a tiny portion for $22. The whole dish was again completely under seasoned. I should probably have learned my lesson and not gotten lamb a second time. Husband got the duck confit; okay, but chewy, overcooked duck.   Sad to say, won't be back here. Service is great. Food is not so great."}
{"text":"A central location if you're headed to or coming from an Indians game or the Theater.  This place looks and feels super upscale and like you'd be paying for an overpriced meal but they're very affordable; just a classy environment.  Staff is friendly, though I have had both good and bad experiences (but everyone has an off day, bad experiences are very infrequent...maybe 1 in 20 times I've gone)  **Note: I've never been there for dinner.  Lunch only.  They have some wonderful lunch specials that allows me to get an exquisite meal for under 10 dollars.  The french onion soup is to die for.   Think of a thick savory broth steaming as it comes out to you with house made croutons (I think the croutons are just super toasted house made bread).  You'll be served a roll fresh from their ovens, still hot enough to melt the REAL BUTTER you get on a side plate (none of that packaged fake crap).  A light dish of salt is also provided and they use those super long ground pepper things if you want pepper added.   Damn, just thinking about it is making me salivate.   Going to have to go back next week to get more of that.  The main dish was a sausage sandwich (uploaded an image of it) with a side of the Beef Stroganoff sauce and a side of chips.   Now let's talk about each component here:  Chips are made in house and are very good, crisp, salted just enough, and are sometimes warm when I get them (warm chips are the best!)    The sausage is seasoned well for meat lovers, not hot, but it's got a seasoning that has a little kick.   The sauteed peppers they put over it enhance and support the flavor of the sausage.  This sandwich is HUGE so don't expect to eat it all in one sitting.  Talk half with you to go or share.  My only complaint is that the house made bread is delicious but there's a bit much of it so if you don't take off some of the bread some people might find it too doughy.    One thing I'd recommend (though it costs a little extra...less than a dollar) is to get a side of their Beef Stroganoff sauce.  It's an excellent additive flavor to the sausage if you pour some of it onto the sandwich and is something you can dip that extra bread in.  Chips are good dipped in it too (like, REALLY good).  You might want to ask to try some first, I know a few people who found the sauce too salty to just pour on the sandwich."}
{"text":"NOT RECOMMENDED  Our service was EXCELLENT, dinner was awful.   Martinis - small (but good blue cheese olives) Calamari - tons of breading to stretch it Salads (all) - dry, no dressing and weird ingredients Brisket - excellent Salmon - good not great Lamb - DRY and DISGUSTING Steak - over cooked and dry  We are not a complaining group, but we had to send 2 of the entrees back. All of the food here feels and tastes cheap, but trying to dress it up to justify the overcharge.  Stripped-down setting, not super cute inside. If they got a new chef I think this place has potential.  The bad meals were taken off the bill which we appreciated."}
{"text":"District is not your typical sushi joint--walk in and be taken away by the dark upscale-chic ambiance, the small seating space with a full bar in the back, the smooth house background music, and of course the upscale prices. It's a jarring contrast from not just your typical Japanese-style sushi house, but also the old greasy neighbourhood fish-and-chips joint that used to occupy this address when I was a kid.  The intimate vibe suits couples best, but most of their menu is meant to be served communally, amongst your party. Their maki rolls are tasty and well-presented. The staff are very accommodating, and made my parents feel extra-welcome when we went here once for an anniversary.  {TTC: any Queen streetcar to Saulter St.}"}
{"text":"Came here for a night out with the girls. It has a very modern and cool ambiance and a creative sushi menu. They also had delish pear and plum sake.  The service was ok, but our waitress basically told us that she wanted to go home and asked us to settle up our bill before we had finished our drinks. She then closed out the bill when only 3 people had paid- saying that the last person couldn't pay by credit card"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, both my date and I. Late November, doing Playhouse theater on a Sunday afternoon. My date - where shall we eat after? Tremont? I immediately go on Yelp and search for good restaurants nearby. District had received an excellent review from Cleveland.com yet mixed/mediocre reviews from patrons...We should have trusted the patron reviews. The food  just okay and beverages overpriced. They were busy for the 1.5 hours after our show, the server took over 10 minutes to greet us, another 10 for the drinks to arrive; though I'd made a reservation and we arrived early. While eating the meatball appetizer (way too over-spiced to taste the \"angus beef\"), they ran out of bread, which was around 7 PM. Seriously? I've never heard of a restaurant that runs out of bread (isn't that a throwaway?) during dinner service.   Take note that if you're going to Playhouse Square, take a few minutes and drive downtown or Tremont, Ohio City or Little Italy for your meal before or after the show. I guarantee you will not be disappointed as we were with District.  Read reviews and responses from the restaurant posted here. Agreed."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week but a little later in the evening. Our waiter was very nice and accommodating. Unfortunately many things on the menu were no longer available, which I kinda understand since we were there around 8:30pm. Anyways, after they were out of the third thing we tried to order, he let us order anything on the dessert menu which was nice.  So for apps we got the rice and chicken soup and the beet and apple salad. Soup was delicious but really really small portion. They plated in a shallow bowl which made it that much harder to eat. The salad was good although wilted, it seemed like it had been sitting in its dressing for a while and didn't have great crunch.   For entrees we got the highly recommended paella and the barramundi. Paella was not as flavorful as I would've expected but the seafood was all cooked well. The barramundi was delicious but the sauce was way too strong with lemon. Unfortunately, the spinach risotto was sitting in the sauce so I couldn't taste anything except lemon. But what I could eat from the top of the pile was delicious, and luckily the fish was lying on top of the risotto and not in the sauce  Lastly dessert, which was perfect. I got fire and ice aka chocolate lava cake and ice cream. It was so decadent and the hot cake was perfectly balanced by the creamy ice cream (and I don't even like vanilla ice cream).  Finished it all. My boyfriend got the semifredo crème brulle but I didn't get to taste it since he finished it in one breath. So I guess that's a sign it was also good. So overall a mixed experience, maybe next time I'll try to go during \"regular\" dinner time."}
{"text":"We tried to stop in this evening.  I made an online reservation and was promptly told that they don't accept online reservations made after 5pm on the same day.  I've been here a number of times, and I usually reserve a couple of hours in advance.    I guess it's to be expected, as the neighbourhood is getting busier, particularly on the weekend.  The message could have been delivered a bit more professionally, but since I typically have had good experiences here, I won't let an off day put me off entirely.    I still like the decor and the food, so I'll come back.  Word to the wise, don't make same day reservations after 5pm b/c they won't honour them."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant after we could not get a reservation last week before the Lewis Black show. We were seated off in the northwest corner of the restaurant and it was cold to the point of being unpleasant. The acoustics are horrible and it's hard to hold a normal dinner conversation.  The waiter demeanor was perfunctory and inattentive. The food was uninspired and bland. The Beef Beaujolais was especially disappointing because the cut of beef was 50% untrimmed fat. Disgusting! I asked for the manager, who turned out to be the owner, to talk about the Beef Beaujolais. His lame response was to give me the restaurant's business card and promise to make my next reservation at the restaurant. He was obviously too busy parading around a bottle of his favorite wine to various tables to care much about me or the food served in his restaurant. At any other descent restaurant in town, the manager would have insisted on comping the meal, buth the thought never entered his mind.  Don't bother with this restaurant. There is much better dining close by."}
{"text":"Won't go back. Server was pleasant food was underseasoned and way overpriced. I sent my dish back and the manager assured me that it would be better and he had the chef taste it. I think the chef needs new taste buds."}
{"text":"The food was great - filet of beef prepared exact - tender well seasoned along with the Brussel sprouts and potato purée- service was friendly and quick.  The atmosphere is simple but chic.  One great thing, the butter was soft and spreadable unlike allot of nicer establishments that serve cold butter that can't be spread!"}
{"text":"Went there before seeing Alt-J at the Playhouse. FYI this is 'across the street' from the playhouse and technically on 14th street (not Euclid.)    The atmosphere is cool, decent decor but nothing mindblowing.   The Service is Excellent!  ALL the people i interacted with were in the 'new restaurant' phase still, where they acted like I'd be reviewing them immediately after =)   Drinks were good, but a bit pricey... But its downtown so that cancels out the cost.    Food was GOOD but not Amazing for the price.  I had the seafood risotto which had shrimp scallops and mussels.  The mussels were so small, i would advise them to skip them in lieu of more shrimp or scallops instead.  The gooey risotto was nice, but like 80% of the plate....could have used more 'seafood' IMO.   My wife had the Salmon dish, which they HAPPILY accommodated her menu change requests for free.  Huge Win.  The Fish was delicious, and the complimentary bread and dipping stuff they give you is also amazing.    My friends had their Lamb Gnocchi, which I enjoyed more than my own dish.  Overall, a nice place with some good potential, but not out of the park."}
{"text":"We had a table of 5 and were not in any hurry. We arrived 30mins ahead of our reservation so we sat at the bar and were served pretty quickly. Drinks were served promptly and the place was packed with the theater crowd. By the time we took our table at 730 the place was pretty well deserted and we had the place to ourselves allowing for easy conversation. We all had salads and soup and a shared starter: beet and apple salad, butternut squash salad and Greek salad, onion soup, and the mussels. The mussels were a bit late but the manager explained they were out of the stock (ale and cheddar) but made them for us with a broth from an earlier menu ...I say stick with this, light and citrusy really highlighted the flavor of the mussels which were excellent. The whole table ordered steaks 4 filets and one steak bavette. All the steaks but one came out as ordered and the manager offered to refire but we opted not to. The steak bavette was excellently prepared and was very flavorful. The portion sizes were perfect as well. Not too small not too big. The filets came with mashed potatoes which were creamy and light with a sweet reduction that complimented the Brussel sprouts well. My steak bavette was served with creamed corn which was nice and didn't drown the polenta or steak.  For my palette the dishes are seasoned very well. My suggestions would be strictly based on preferences of the table were bread to be warm although tasty and light would be made better if warmed, and a couple lighter starter options. Overall service was good and attentive by our waiter and manager and food was tasty. I will go back to give it another whirl but will target the non peak times as the place was packed for the theater crowd. We had 730 reservations and when we arrived at 7 it was hopping. Take a seat at the bar and enjoy the comfortable atmosphere before dinner. Reservations highly recommended for pre show dinner."}
{"text":"About one-third, in a modest estimation, of my paycheck goes to dining out. So when I spend a little extra on a place like this, I'm hoping for a justifiable expense. Lol   The pluses - staff was attentive, awesome location downtown, diverse menu, my butternut squash soup was delightful.   The negatives - my rice pilaf was undercooked, meatballs had too much seasoning.  Not sure I'll be back because though the menu sounds awesome, the finished product was not"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch based on the reviews and references.  we found it to be underwhelming.  Ok food underseasoned and not value for the price. Server was overly friendly - but never refilled the ice tea glasses."}
{"text":"The vegetable soup was very thick and chunky..the pesto gnocci had a load of pesto that was very oily and watery..the lambs sauce tasted like BBQ sauce..the Caeser salad tasted charred...nice and quiet because everyone disappeared for the theatre... bartender was very chatty and loud across the room...you get my drift"}
{"text":"Brought wifey here for dinner a few weeks back and loved almost everything about it.  The one server was on by himself, and he was apologetic as he busted his tail to make sure people didn't feel forgotten and that orders were brought out reasonably quick.  The only disappointing aspect was the Salmon-Salmon roll.  We both wanted to order it, the waiter even recommended it, and we were both pretty indifferent to it.  After speaking to a few people from work who've also been here, they've also said it was their least favourite menu item--so heads up.  We're heading back this week.  Aware of the intimate seating arrangements, I've got my fingers crossed hoping that we don't end up sitting beside some dbags who take pictures of their food all night, or speak loudly about banal minutiae."}
{"text":"I walked into here as I work downtown in very close proximity. I went here to check it out and have a happy hour drink and check out the menu.  First off, the place inside is beautiful. And not like beautiful as in ornate or anything, it just has a very intimate, classy, and modern look which I find very appealing and fresh. I got to try the Asian Pear signature drink and it was DELICIOUS! The perfect balance of alcohol and sweet. The next drink I had was the Lavender Passion, and once again a perfectly crafted cocktail of just wonderful flavors.  UPDATE: I had lunch here during work, and it was wonderful! I had the angel hair stroganoff with beef and mushrooms. It was delicious, filling, and a perfect portion!  Service is exceptional here. Prompt, friendly, and very down to earth! Fantastic!"}
{"text":"If there was less than 1-star, I would give this place 0-star. The service was horrible and the food was terrible. The seafood we ordered was not fresh at all and the service did not make up for it."}
{"text":"Very busy place here on a Friday night. Definitely has a queen street feel with the decor.   Food is a little pricey but not bad. Shrimp tempura appetizer is a good size for sharing. Sweet potato wedges are well paired with the wasabi mayo.   Rolls are very good. They have a different pink dragon roll that has scallops on the top. Green dragon rolls are definitely a must try. The avocado is very thinly sliced sprinkled with something yummy on top."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, randomly walked in before a play at playhouse square. We were able to sit at the bar with no reservation, When other restaurants were full. The drinks were awesome - all titled after the play we went to see \"Wicked\". Ordered a strip steak for dinner, was surprised it was smothered in gravy. The menu did not depict that it would be served that way and would have preferred it on the side. We received complementary dessert shots at the end which were delicious. Overall, very pleased and would return."}
{"text":"With all of the good reviews on Yelp, we expected a lot more.  This restaurant basically caters to the theater crowd - people who are interested in getting something relatively fancy prior to their show at Playhouse.  We came during restaurant week on a Sunday.  Because there was no show on Sunday, there was only one other table in the restaurant with people.  Tried their seasonal soup, which was a sweet potato soup - kind of bland and uninteresting.  For our entries we tried the salmon and the angel hair beef stroganoff.  The pasta in both dishes was clumpy and felt like it was microwaved.  The beef was overdone and very tough.  The salmon was overdone but still okay.  For dessert, we tried the semifredo creme brulee.  Interesting concept, and the creme itself tasted like ice cream.  But the sugar on top was caramelized quite a bit too much (read: burnt).   Don't know if it was just an off day because it was a non-theater day, but we're probably not coming back here."}
{"text":"Good food, wide selection, fair sized portions and good service. It is a great addition to the theater district.  I visited again for lunch today.  The burger I had was as good as any I have had in the area and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time before seeing a play recently. I selected it because the menu was appealing and I figured it would be a great dining experience. While the service was great and our server was quick, very responsive and very friendly, the food itself was a huge disappointment. Everything was bland and it felt more like we were eating cafeteria food than dining in a nice restaurant. Again, I have nothing but positive things to say about their staff -- from the host who was lovely to our server, we were very pleased and that's why I am giving them two stars instead of one. But at the end of the day, we came here to eat and it was such a letdown.   We ordered the USDA Prime Meatballs appetizer, Cleveland Onion Soup, Linguine Mediterranean and a pork special. The food wasn't appetizing from the moment it arrived at the table -- the presentation was dismal. The entrees looked like they were slopped on plates/bowls from a big vat of mush. The special was just a big pile of white mush with some pork hidden underneath. The meatballs were decent, however. Not great, but edible.   I left after eating only four bites of my entree and quite frankly, I felt ripped off. We didn't complain, because we didn't want to ruin anyone's day and we weren't looking for any sort of comps. We just felt like we deserved so much better for the money we were paying.   I feel sorry for the staff, because they treated us well and they deserve better food to support their efforts. Oh well. You live, you learn."}
{"text":"UNSPECTACULAR.............simple enough.  menu is dull and uninspired.....i expected SO much more from this place. looks like a menu rehashed from the late '90s.  cocktails, ok, service, ok, atmosphere is like a school cafeteria, nothing you want to hang out in, food is not something i can, or care to,  remember. it was JUST OK, but not special, good or creative enough to return.....just dull. even the dessert menu....dull. lava cake? really? geez, that's so innovative and crazy! and that was the best choice on the dessert menu.......like i said, dull they'll need to amp this place up to get a returning customer base. it really caters to the tastes of a bunch of theater people who really don't eat out that often, so i guess the menu is \"dumbed down\" for them? and a BIG PS......do they ever wash those gross cuttingboards they leave on all of the tables?"}
{"text":"Very American dining experience with a menu slightly unique but classic in some ways. The service was quite exceptional. Not my first choice to visit again but not a place if avoid."}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey, but you get what you pay for here. The food was delicious and the staff was very nice even on a busy night. The drinks are themed after iconic broadway musicals, which made me laugh. We splurged this night and got dessert with French pressed coffee before going to see \"Aladdin.\" It was a blast and the coffee was really great as well! I will be returning to District."}
{"text":"Jared (our waiter) was charming and informative.  The menu was interesting, but not inspired (creamed corn, really Chef?).  Presentation was nice, the wine menu a surprise.  We stopped by on Saturday after a matinee at Cinema on the Square and it was fun to watch the wedding parties arrive across the street (stretch limo's and tennis shoes with tuxes and gowns). Would I go back?  Out of convenience, yes. But I've also been know to stop at Burger King out of convenience. Although palatable (District, not Burger King) I was not wowed, especially for the price.  Again, Jared (our server) was awesome, Dessert I found uninspired and a total disappointment. I ordered the creme brûlée with berries and was surprised to find it to be an ice cream, not Creme Brûlée!  Not a very pleasant surprise, nor was it a creme brûlée.  Worst of all it was tasteless. Dessert should be a final remembrance of a good meal, not distract from the whole experience.  It left a bad taste in my mouth, literally and figuratively.   Go for the excellent service and convenience, expect slightly above average food and skip dessert.  Thought about it more.  When a Chef has to \"reinvent\" a classic, it shows a lack of culinary talent & imagination."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner after matinee show at Connor Palace Theater. No reservations at 5pm on Sun but easy to be seated at full-service bar. Service was by the bartender. It was a little spotty at first (forgot to make the drink I ordered), but very attentive afterwards. Bartender made excellent food recommendations.  Our food was actually quite good for the most part. Harvest salad was a little too vinegary, but apple and beet salad with soy vinaigrette was delicious. The balsamic berry cocktail was also unique--good strawberry flavor with just a hint of balsamic. Salmon was well prepared. Will probably be back next time we're around Playhouse Square."}
{"text":"VIBE I really like the vibe of this place. It seats about 30, has some great chandeliers and cool paintings on the wall. At night, it's got a nice, intimate vibe. Perfect for a date, at the bar alone or for a small group. Upbeat music plays in the background but isn't obtrusive.  A note that the staff here are really nice and the food comes relatively quickly.   I ATE  Enoki mushrooms wrapped in beef. The mushrooms kind of look like alfalfa sprouts. It's served on a bed of spinach and soya sauce. It was good but for $10 I probably wouldn't get this dish again.   I had the tempura laden dynamite rolls as well. These were circular and jammed with creamed cheese, avocado, and shrimp. I felt like the taste all melded together. On top of that, they were just really difficult to eat.    I'd still go back though and try the spicy tuna and edamame.   It's a bit pricier than most joints. In total, with a pop, tax and tip my meal came out to $34.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  I'll be back in the Leslieville DISTRICT for sushi. I just won't order what I had last time."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. Staff was great but the food was awful. I ordered the gnocchi special and when I got it, there was no sauce. It was dry, no flavor. Very disappointing. Also they have there dishes on the table when you sit down which have 3 condiments for bread but NO BREAD!!! We had to ask for bread and then they only gave you one piece each. Overall chef needs to taste the food before serving it. $18 for a flavorless dish!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good restaurant for dinner and We stumbled upon District. This restaurant was so good! The drinks are phenomenal, food is excellent and a great value for the price, dessert was amazing as well! All of the staff members/ owner was very friendly and made us feel right at home! One of the best restaurants I've been to in a very long time! My boyfriend and I definitely plan on returning."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place tonight! Although it was slow night in the restaurant, the server & bartender took such great care of me. I had a tasty Chardonnay and merlot (which is important for a CA girl on the road), and the food was very yummy too. I had the basic greens and chicken, although i want to come back and try the chickpea salad and goose confit or seafood dishes (on a non-sunday).   As I have been saying since I have had to travel here, Cleveland is under-rated! The theatre and downtown district has a lot of potential, and District is an example of this blooming scene."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Great service. Food choice decent. Prices, a bit overpriced.  One of the ten of our part got fish that was dry and terrible. Another two people in the party got the filet and the steak was cut in half, weird. Very dry and not worth $26.  The best part was the Lava cake, that was well worth the 9 min wait. Overall I don't think we will come back just based on the food alone. But not going to knock the place."}
{"text":"Great dishes, very affordable, great service and super fast.  Have been here a couple of times with co-workers for lunch and I highly recommend this place.  Nice ambiance and decor too!"}
{"text":"I went to District on a Wednesday night after work. Appetizer was bread pudding salad (delicious) and a little caprese salad (again delicious). I tried two dishes, mushroom risotto and scallops with rice pilaf. These two dishes were rich, almost too rich. The scallops and rice pilaf were bathing in a butter-ish sauce, very rich. I wish it was toned down. Then dessert, my favorite! A spoonful of a strawberry mousse and grilled peaches with panna cotta. Delicious!! BUT because the two main dishes were so rich, it made eating the dessert (almost) too much. Almost. All in all, delicious, very flavorful. The service was great! I would recommend District if someone was going to be in the area. But I would probably not go back, I rather try a new restaurant out."}
{"text":"You know when you go to your friend's parent's house and the food is good but you wouldn't spend $100 for it? That's feeling we had here. Nothing was bad, just seemed bland. Our appetizer, the goat cheese and scallops: Three fried scallops, two pieces of deep fried cheese. Just not a wow factor. Tried the goose confit at the recommendation of the staff, who was professional and took good care of us (although there were like only three tables at the time). It was well cooked, I'm told it is smoked slowly. The cranberry sauce didn't really taste of much and potato puree wasn't pureed. They were unseasoned mashed potatoes. My wife had the grouper special. If you call baking a piece of fish with lemon and butter special. With all of the options within walking distance of District, we both agreed, it was worth a shot but for the money, we'd prefer something else."}
{"text":"Placed our group of 16 (2 tables of 8) in the alcove which worked out very well. Was like having a private room without being cut off to the restaurant atmosphere. Decor is modern and simple. Bar tenders very attentive and we were served quickly cocktails sized appropriately. Moscow mule also a popular cocktail with our group.  Greek salad big, so shared by 3 which was plenty with dinner.  Friends enjoyed the flavorful mussels - great sauce. Had filet au poivre which was tasty and tender. Thought it should have been plated with gravy on the plate then filet and then topped with potatoes. Instead the gravy was pored over the filet and potatoes giving it a pot roast look. Nonetheless I enjoyed it. Husband had Delmonico said it was OK but was disappointed with roasted potatoes he sub for Broccoli Gratin.  Said they tasted like they were out of a bag, overcooked, dry and tasteless. I had same ones but they were smothered in gravy. Were fine for me.  Loved the Fire and Ice desert (lava cake with ice cream). Baked perfectly with a tender cake shell with yummy warm rich chocolate center. Others enjoyed the Double Chocolate Ganache. Don't let the Espresso Kahlua Soup description throw you. A few of us would have ordered it but the \"soup\" description turned us off.  Our loss.  Mint Kiss, Dark and Dulce and Fighting Irishman all popular after dinner drinks and coffees at our table.   This is my second visit to restaurant and I would go again. Service good though our server could have been a bit more helpful in explaining menu items. Not sure if he didn't know or just hurried. He was good and attentive. Menu isn't one that will knock you socks off but there's enough variety and prices are fair."}
{"text":"I really love their play on beef stroganoff. However, it always seems to upset my stomach, so if you aren't someone that can handle a rich meal, I would t recommend it. They start you with pretty good rolls. It's a good location near Play House Square."}
{"text":"We left $40+tax and I was still hungry when we left the establishment. The rolls were nothing special. They were small and I could barely taste the shrimp in Red Dragon rolls and scallop in Scallop Rolls. If you're craving rolls, I'd recommend to go somewhere else (hint: Japango has amazing rolls). I should say that the girl serving us was very friendly and attentive. Perhaps, other items on the menu taste good and provide good value for your money, but I was not impressed with the ratio of quantity/quality to price."}
{"text":"Hoorah for District.   This was one of my first ever ventures into Leslieville (despite 3 years of living in Toronto) and while I can't say I'm a huge fan of the neighbourhood (it's just not my style), I can say District \"Modern Japanese Bistro\" is a great little spot.  The restaurant is small, dark and intimate, with seating for maybe 30 or so. We arrived at 6pm on Friday and most of the tables were reserved for 7pm seatings. The waitress gave us a table anyway and I assured her we would try not to linger too long.  The food is meant to be shared/tapas style. They had a good selection of cold and hot appetizers, soups, salads, sashimi and maki.   We tried edamame, sweet potato wedges and the tuna tartar, followed by two of the specialty maki rolls - the district roll and the red dragon roll (I'll attach photos)  The food was beautiful served and I loved everything. The speciality rolls were both amazing.  Big props to our waitress too - she was truly awesome. She was great at follow up and made small talk with us. We had no problems getting the avocado in both rolls subbed with cucumber (my friend has an intolerance for avocado). The fish seemed very fresh.  I was very impressed by this place. \"Ghetto\" sushi is normally my thing (Sushi on Bloor, anyone?) but District did an awesome job of upscale sushi.  I'd go back, if it weren't in Leslieville :)"}
{"text":"Came here on the suggestion of family of one of the employees. Had an excellent dinner. Our tremendous server suggested the Calamari appetizer and the Filet. My wife got the surf and surf at his suggestion too. Honestly this was some of the best food I have ever eaten. Fresh HOMEMADE bread to start the meal, delicious and immensely flavorful calamari, not chewy in the lease, a filet that could turn any vegetarian, bass and shrimp with the most spectacular sauce, and then some spectacular baked whipped cream flan dessert thing in strawberry soup and a fresh HOMEMADE lava cake with ice cream to complete the meal. Every bite was delicious and so high in quality. Heard another server tell a table that they were not serving the goose because it \"didn't meat the chef's standards.\" If that's true than this restaurant is one of the best in Cleveland. Its staff was professional, friendly, and well trained. Management was table side at least twice to ensure our meal was \"perfect\" and my god the food. Will be back, again, again, again, again, and again.  PS Drinks are a bit too pricey though."}
{"text":"We went to District on a Saturday night without a reservation so we sat at the bar.  The bartender Ryan was very attentive and friendly.  The food was excellent. A wide selection of salads and drinks.   I ordered the scallops (the appetizer). They were perfectly cooked and well presented.  Cheesecake and coffee for dessert both excellent as well.   Highly recommended.  Nice to see nice restaurants popping up in downtown!!"}
{"text":"Group Buy Coupon led me to District on this Sunday evening!  Modern and Chic deco... a great dating place... unfortunately I am with my girlfriend, the last thing I thought of was being romantic with her....all I think about was food..and both of us were a little disappointed.  Seaweed Salad ($8) - The best dish we ordered for the night. - Seaweed and Avocado offered contrasting texture and taste...but really complimenting each other!  Sushi Platter ($17) - Nice presentation  - fish selections was quite good...I still not crazy about nigri sushi that do not have any wasabi inside...maybe I am just picky!  Tempura Udon ($12) - Big portion but I find the tempura batter a little on the heavy side - They should have serve the tempura separately as when the udon arrived at our table, all the tempura got all soggy from sitting in the soup - The Dashi broth though was quite tasty.  District has to be one of the nicer and more trendy Japanese restaurant in Leslieville, worth a visit if you are in the area. But doesn't worth your while if you have to make a special trip!"}
{"text":"My review is based off lunch experiences only.   Their lunch menu has an amazing deal for soup or salad with a wrap and homemade chips for $10 (or an entree for $15). Plus bread for the table and a soda. Great deal, right?!?! Each time I've been there I had soup and a wrap. Their soups are just amazing! I've really enjoyed the schnitzel wrap as well. Come to think of it, I think I had it every time because it was so good. Their wraps are even homemade. The chips are ok.  And now we come to the BUT. Lunch service for soup and a sandwich cannot take an hour and 45 minutes!!! Luckily I was with my boss. If you're not there by 11:45, then forget it, you're going to take forever. I love the food, but none of my coworkers will take the chance of missing meetings waiting for service there. Some have even left without food because they couldn't wait any longer. And the staff doesn't seem to get that it's taking forever, they aren't at all apologetic and it'll be right out means less than 2 minutes in my book.  I'm willing to stand up for the food, but get your stuff together, man!"}
{"text":"Good spot before tickets to see Ron White.  Menu was plentiful.  Huge wine selection.  Service was good.  Loud ambiance. Filet mignon with stuffed blue cheese potatoes and carrots.  Tables are super voles together so it's like you're dining with new, closely seated friends."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for pre and post theater.  My husband had this amazing seafood pumpkin curry and I had the veal with seafood over green pea risotto. We also had the clam chips appetizer and onion soup.  Then we went to the theater, and walked back across the street for desert, which included watching the Indians beat the Blue Jays. The valet had our car ready for us, and we rolled home. Great nite in the CLE."}
{"text":"I feel compelled to post this review after reading the review about running out of bread. We love district. We have been about 4 or 5 times and we LOVE LOVE LOVE the bread. We understand it is fresh and sometimes we ask for seconds!  It's a guilty pleasure. I also feel that posting reviews can be helpful for the restaurant and they should be perfect but who is perfect?  Let the restaurants fix the mistake while you are at the table. I haven't tried the meatballs but I love the calamari, lamb t- bone and the salmon. Bring the goose confit back!"}
{"text":"I won't be back by my choice.  I was so disappointed.  I ordered the flank steak. It was unseasoned, the cook was completely off, and the texture was all off.  This \"steak\" was much more of a ground beef patty shaped into a dry steak-like shape.  It was supposed to came with brussel sprouts that were overcooked mush.  I now understand why kids grow up saying they hate brussel sprouts.  To be fair, the bf ordered lamp which was supposed to come with cous cous.  The lamb actually tasted good.  Arguably, the only thing that was right about this meal.  They came out and told us that they ran out of cous cous.  We ordered mussels for us to share.  It was a much smaller portion of mussels that we've been served at any other restaurant.  The sauce was disappointing -- and that's sad, because one of the best parts of ordering mussels is to dip bread in the yummy sauce.  We also got fire and ice for dessert... it was ok.  I would recommend skipping dessert here and going someplace after for dessert.  ----------------------------------- Explanation of my rating system - 5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back 4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category 3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either. 2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it. 1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"The place was very slow as there was no theater business so the service was great. I had the Bocca (Vietnamese catfish) with a spicy tomato chutney.  It was outstanding!  Just spicy enough to be interesting.  The fish was perfectly prepared, light and flavorful. Not \"fishy at all. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"On News Year Eve, myself and seven friends came in for a nice meal before ringing in the New Year. I must say, I was a bit skeptical after reading previous reviews. District did not disappoint! It was a 4 course meal & everything was excellent. Our server was professional and attentive, which can make or a break the meal. I enjoyed the calamari which was unusual  to any other calamari I have had. The Filet came out with crumbled goat cheese that soon melted onto the steak, delicious touch. I will be back to try their regular menu very soon!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of eight before a play. So convenient and so delicious!  We had great service. Very nice wine list. Everyone liked their selection. Falafel was moist with a nice tomato sauce and green beans. Flank steak was tender and came covered with corn, which was a treat. Penne with shrimp, spinach, and olives was delicious. The bistro feels upscale with clean lines decor. The windows were a nice feature. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"The short :I was in Cleveland for a few days on business and decided to visit here based on several reviews including a top 100 cleveland restaurants.  This restaurant caters more to the theater going crowed and specializes in everything being homemade - including their delectable bread.  The food was very solid, a good value for the pricing overall and could have been slightly more imaginative in places.  I had the mushroom and cheese appetizer, cream of carrot/orange/ginger soup, lamb (one of their signature dishes) and trifle.    The long: The appetizer was delicious and served with what seemed to be a vodka cream sauce.  The bread they brought out was superb...seriously, save room for their homemade rolls.  Flaky, buttery with a nice pull to the dough...I'm serious about my bread and usually don't bother with restaurant bread - I would buy just this bread as an appetizer.  The soup was exceptional, although after having red wine with my appetizer it hit the palate just a little sweet, but was mild, spicy and subtly interesting - would have paired well with a crisp white wine.  Thankfully they didn't overdo the cream as is so often the case with these soups.    I was a bit let down by the signature lamb dish.  I expected the middle eastern variation to fill the mouth with spices...it was flavorful and the meat fell off the bone but I would have gotten a different dish as it tasted rather unimaginative.  Lacking the originality I expected after my soup.  The risotto and vegetarian lasagna both sounded amazing.  The bartender recommended and excellent wine to pair with my dinner - I requested a red, so I can't fault her for the soup and red wine combination...but it paired beautifully with the mushrooms and lamb.  The wines are VERY reasonable.  I paid just $10 for an 8oz pour...an average price there!  The trifle was tasty but in october I shouldn't have ordered something with strawberries.  Next time I would try one of their chocolate dishes.    As a business traveler this place was dead by 8pm on a week night...as I expect all of the places in that area are.  It caters for theater goers so I suspect it is very lively on the weekends.  I would stick more to the 6th street to 3rd street area next time."}
{"text":"I came in a party of 3 for restaurant week at 7:00 pm with a reservation. I missed the red flag when all other top restaurants in Cleveland were booked from 7-9pm through Open Table, but this place was completely available all night for reservations.  I would summarize this place as serving mostly underwhelming food in the disguise of a place you would expect to get a higher quality meal from.  Service here for me was poor. In my opinion you can only fool so many people once, but I guess the theater crowd keeps this place afloat on weekends.  Pros: -Modern/Chic Ambiance -Very good martini -Salmon entree was pretty good.  Not blow your mind good, but good. -Tasty butter that comes with the bread -Manager said he was going to make things right for us after we were upset with steak being frozen in the center.  An attempt to make things right is better than some places. -Manager took 15% off the bill due to an entree failure -Manager comped a dessert due to an entree failure -Free cranberry spice rum cordials were given to everyone at the end of the meal which were very good.   Cons: -Table had to be bussed when we arrived on time for our 7:00 reservation on Saturday night during restaurant week.  -Server did not arrive at our table for 15 minutes (tables on either side were being taken care of). Hostess came after 12 minutes to fill our water and then told us a waiter would be with us shortly.  We felt ignored and not acknowledged.  -Server did not introduce themselves and failed to say their name  -Server said he would come back with rolls and a trio of butter/oil, but only came back with the rolls (rolls were not even warm and did not seem particularly fresh).  He came back with the butter after I asked and he acknowledged he forgot it.  -Restaurant week menu was not offered.  My party however asked for it since we knew the restaurant was part of restaurant week,  -First course (Soup and Salad) came out very slow (45 minutes). This is when there were only 4 tables occupied in the restaurant.  Previously the restaurant was about half full, but that crowd left to see a show at the nearby theater.  -Soup that came out (Carrot/Ginger Soup) on the restaurant week menu was lukewarm.  It tasted ok for what it was, but nothing special.   -Beef Wellington (restaurant week special with +$10 uncharge) had an ice cold center.  This is essentially a piece of filet mignon that is supposed to be seared and then wrapped in puff pastry and then baked.  The fact that this had an ice cold center implies that this piece of meat was frozen.  Unacceptable for a +$10 upcharge or for any place serving filet for that matter.  Makes me question, what else is frozen here.  -Kitchen tried to correct the beef Wellington, but obviously they couldn't correct something that has to be seared, baked, and wrapped in puff pastry and baked for 30 minutes.  As a result a steak that was supposed to be cooked to medium was then attempted to be corrected by the kitchen, but resulted in a well done piece of steak.  Who wants to eat a well done filet?  -Gnocchi (restaurant week special) flavor tasted off and was not very good.  It was overcooked and far from being fluffy as gnocchi should.  It was very dense.  -One lady in our party of three did not want dessert when the server asked as they were planning to share with her husband who ordered dessert.  To make up for her husband's failed Beef Wellington, a creme brûlée was given to her and comped.  She said she didn't want dessert keep in mind.... The creme brûlée that arrived however appeared to be mostly frozen/icy and the berries that accompanied it were frozen.  Very odd. Maybe this was frozen like the beef was above. It was still tasty, but it is supposed to be a custard which it was not. You can't bring out a comped dessert and then not execute on that.  The presentation was very good however.  -7 Layer Carrot Cake did not taste fresh and it was dry.  I expected a 7 layer piece of cake, but it was really just 7 cookie cutter circles stacked on top of each other.  The presentation was very good however."}
{"text":"I came here twice and wow! The food is so amazing!  It is true... very pricey but a generous portion at such an elegant place. I was blown away. So I've had... (combining my two experiences)  ====Appetizers (about 7-9 pieces each)==== - Tuna Tataki $10 - really soft tuna, tasted perfect. This was my favourite. - Spicy Ebi Mayo $9 - large tasty shrimps with a hint of spiciness. It took me two bites to finish!  ====Yaki Udon (portion is enough for a girl)==== - Chicken $12 - I'd say... lots of veggies, chicken was tender, and the udon was the good-quality kind! Yes, there's good and cheap quality udon...  ====Classic Maki==== - Spicy Roll (8 pcs) $10 - \"salmon, tuna, crunchy tempura bits, cucumber, avocado, tobiko, spicy mayo\" and it's as good as it sounds. But 4/5 stars for me... good but didn't blow me away.  ====Specialty Maki==== - Green Dragon (9 pcs?) $13 - Wow! This was really good! As simple as Green Dragon has always been, this was really really good!! I thoroughly enjoyed it. - Rainbow (8 pcs) $12 - \"kani, cucumber, avocado, tobiko, topped with salmon, tuna, hamachi and avocado.\" I loved the sashimi topping, they were so soft! They're not stingy with it either.   SERVICE?  Truly great. Server checked in on us frequently enough that it wasn't bothersome. We felt very taken care of and comfortable at the restaurant, and we were free to talk nonstop even after our bill! He continued to serve us water too :)   Both times, it was about $15-20 per person. For me (a little girl), I got full! Can't speak the same for my male coworkers though.  Lastly... I honestly came here for edamame. I LOVE EDAMAME. But both times, I wasn't with people who wanted to order that. Seeing the edamame pictures and reviews on Yelp, D'AARRGG!! I want I want I want!"}
{"text":"Nice, open space. A little chilly due to cold winter air coming in when the door opened.  Drink-wise, there was a lot of wine to choose from. Interesting cocktails - some classics and some twists on the classics.  I got the pear salad, which was good, but not as good as the butternut squash salad my friend ordered. I also got the gnocchi appetizer, which was good (you could tell the gnocchi were hand-made), but there was a little too much sauce, and I think it was a bit under-salted.  There was a dish of salt on the table but no utensil to serve it, so I didn't touch it - didn't want to use salt others had pinched before me.  The bread service was a bit odd. They served individual rolls from a basket. However, they seemed store-bought, and they were cold. I would have assumed they were hot and fresh since they're served that way.  One tip - valet is $15, but you get $7 back if you get your ticket validated in the restaurant, which brings parking to $8 - not bad for Playhouse.  All in all, we had a good experience, but I don't know if I'd return - there are so many other, new places to try in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food doesn't match price and ambiance:  - Too much sauce on the otherwise creative sweet potato noodles - Rice and vegetables in spider and unagi rolls too soggy  Pleasant service."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Waiter with an attitude. Not worth the price. Disappointed. the only thing that was good was the beet salad"}
