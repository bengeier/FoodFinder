{"text":"Crunchy shell on the inside, soft warm shell on the outside makes for a perfect, rich and flavorful taco. This is a different realm for tacos in Vegas, it's a must try place in your top \"10 restaurants to try before I die\" list. Pay them a visit and you'll never eat better tacos again."}
{"text":"Been here two times (Sahara and Sloan location). The tacos were delicious and the service was amazing. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I first got a taste of the tacos and then the quesadilla at the DAA Auto Auction now I'm hooked...I searched all over town for anything that could compare but couldn't find anything close then one day talking to a friend who bought a car from me about the best Mexican food that I ever tasted and it came from a food cart he said \" that guy lives around the corner from me and he's open in the evenings on the weekends on Sloan and Sahara\". I hung up the phone and went right there from Summerlin so my kids could get a taste of what I've been telling them for years ... now all they want is the taco man on Sloan ... my only wish is that he wasn't so far away and he was open every day ... it's a long wait for Wednesday at the auction or on the weekend when he's open ... I'm writing this now because I need a quesadilla right now !!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Tacos were delicious. Hot sauce delivers .Sipping some Pacifico rn so I plan on going tonight and trying the carne asada quesadilla."}
{"text":"This is gonna sound like craziness but next to tacos el gordo these are thee best tacos I've had!!!"}
{"text":"Great little Taco trailer! It was a drive but well worth it! The taco is a good as Mexico when we went! I like the guacamole and beans added to it! Must try everything!"}
{"text":"What can I say tacos are good, just really bad service they should be more polite knowing that we are the business. Tacos are very good but these people just need to be polite and at least smile."}
{"text":"I can't even explain how much I love this place and how good the tacos are. Hands down some of the best tacos I've had in my life (and I've had A LOT of tacos). The flavors are most authentic and I believe they have a vegetarian option for those interested (although I've never had one because the carne asada and chicken tacos are amazing). The best thing is that this is near my home and I can visit if I ever have taco cravings (but only Thursday through Sunday of course). Would definitely recommend for late night taco runs with family and friends!"}
{"text":"Nothing not to love about this place.  If you are a fan of Los Tacos then this is the place for you at nearly half the price.  The meat was moist and flavorful, the toppings were fresh.  The tacos are priced appropriately for their size, these are not the tiny little street tacos you would typically expect.  I love this place and am thrilled that they are right around the corner from me."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Had a Carne and Carnitas taco with everything also 2 corn quesadillas. Food was amazing and very fast! Highly recommend this to anyone that is in the mood for highly authentic amazing Mexican food!"}
{"text":"This are the best tacos in Vegas!!! Twice as big as the original size, good quality meat, and they're not stingy with their avocado. Completely recommend them to everyone, just make sure to bring cash (they don't take plastic)."}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco place. I think this place is better than tacos El Gordo. The bad thing is that it's a food truck not a restaurant. However; it's well worth the wait and eating outside or in your car. They have a few chairs where you can sit, but its always busy. I like it so much that i don't mind eating standing. I'm giving 5 stars because the food it's just great. Also, because it's hard to find clean, fresh and great food. I live in SW and I dont mind the drive just to get my taco fix."}
{"text":"The tacos with everything are amazing, the price is a bit high, but the tacos is pretty big so it makes it worth it, the quesadilla was alright, nothing special . But still gets 5 stars, because those tacos are incredible"}
{"text":"Probably the best taco truck I've ever had. Honestly their tacos are better than some of the restaurants here. They are the larger tacos and they pack them with meat, guacamole, beans and pico... super yummmy! Also the quesadillas are the bomb"}
{"text":"Greatest tacos here in Vegas, for an amzing price. No other taco place can compare with these!"}
{"text":"Tacos here are delicious! Full of flavor. You pay a bit more but the tacos are pretty big. Definitely with every $$. Take note: they only take cash!"}
{"text":"BEST Tacos!!  You will LOVE them!!! Fresh ingredients, quite filling and worth their price.  Very clean environment.   You will not be disappointed. Great vegetarian tacos too! Friendly staff : )"}
{"text":"Best taco that I have eaten. The flavor it's all good and the size is the biggest I  saw. A lot of meet inside. The only word to describe the tacos it is The Best."}
{"text":"Genuinely good tacos.. except the fact they always get my order wrong. Think they should invest in selling pastor also. But in general a good little after hours spot"}
{"text":"By far the best taco truck in Las Vegas. Before ever coming to the intersection of Sahara & Sloan I had these tacos on two occasions thanks to them also catering. #TacoTrucksOnEveryCorner"}
{"text":"This is for the food truck on Sloan and Sahara on the east side. The one open Thursday - Sunday from 5-11pm. The one that has like three employees. The one that has THE BEST TACOS EVER. 

I've gone through taco phases. I used to like street taco combos that came with with three tacos and some rice and beans tortilla chips from places like Pepe's. Then I graduated to tacos el tizon where they melted cheese onto the tortilla as a taco base. Then I graduated to Tacos El Gordo street tacos that had adobada and tripas. Then I graduated to Los Tacos where a $4 filled to the max with everything taco was totally worth it. 

This taco truck is like a mix of all of them.

They serve tacos, burritos, and quesadillas. They have perfected the taco in my opinion. 

They take two medium sized tortillas an melt cheese between them. The bottom tortilla touching the grill makes them crip and crunch. They then fill it with the meat, onions, cilantro, beans, and salsa. Wrapped in some foil and it's the taco PERFECTED! The textures are just awesome. I suggest the carnitas- super flavorful OR the lengua or tongue tacos. 

Eat them there while the tortilla is crisp! Then you can add extra salsa and sour cream.

I've been here a handful of times and they get busy. Ive never waited long, but I totally would. I heard the owner used to work at Los Tacos and I'm a Los Tacos of Tacos El Gordo kind of guy so I love this place. Tax is included also."}
{"text":"After going to the springs preserve. My family (my kids, my brother, sister in law, and my nieces) decided to get something quick on the way home. I suggested this place because I've had it a few times and it's been pretty decent and as well as the service. Tonight was really weird and just off. My sister in law ordered food came out to like 21 and some change she paid with 40. The lady at the register took awhile to give back the change. I seen her open up the register and lift it. No clue what she was doing. All of a sudden the guy in the taco truck decides to come out and he's on the phone saying he's calling the cops. Me and my sister in law looked at each other and we're very confused. He then tells us that one of the 20s is fake. He's was acting very weird and sketch. I understand at any establishment they can take any counterfeit money and keep it and call the cops. The lady at the register didn't even check the bill in our sight we had no clue what was going on. For all I know when she lifted her register she swapped out her fake with our real money. It just didn't make any sense to us. Last place my brother got change from was at the springs preserve. So nothing added up. We even called 311 a few times. But it just got so late for the kids. They waited a 2.5 hours no one showed up. These people even said they went to the liquor store right across the truck to check the bill. Which I feel like was total b.s. Just didn't understand this whole thing. They were really rude to us. She could have easily pointed out what was wrong with the bill and we would've went on with our night. We had plenty enough money to pay for the food. But man they made us feel like we were criminals just for a $20 bill. One thing I know for sure we will never come back here and for sure will spread the word of our experience. They deserve no stars for service. The food deserves 3.5 - 4. But my overall experience tonight they deserve 0stars. Not even 1. Too bad I can't leave it blank.."}
{"text":"Tacos were amazing! Tortillas and meat were cooked perfectly, it had really good flavor. Best tacos in town, definitely a must. Staff was friendly and service was great."}
{"text":"I would walk 500 miles to get these delicious tacos, okay okay maybe drive 500 miles. The serving size is generous with fresh ingredients. The green sauce is amazing! They are prepared on 100% corn tortillas, this is important since I am gluten-free (Celiac). The prices are very reasonable too. This family owned business has the best tacos I have had in a very long time."}
{"text":"This this a little taco truck that you must stop at the tacos are $3 or $3.50 but they at packed!! When you ask for every you get guacamole beans pico de gallo and cheese. They half grill fry their tacos and it give it this crunch that is amazing. The quesadillas are so cheesy that you forget the tortilla and if you get it with everything....forgot about eating a taco unless you don't mind not driving anywhere for a minute. They only have three stools so best to get it to go or if you are only going with one or two friends. I have seen the bust out 20 tacos in about 5 minutes!!! So the service is pretty fast. Get taco truck on the east side my one downside is...no drinks serve drinks and you guys could own the east side and have that last star!!!!"}
{"text":"They put cheese in between the tortillas, fill them with beans, tender quality meat, pico, and guac, top with sour cream and once you bite in you realize: these tacos are on a whole nother level. They catered taco day at my apartments and now I'm hooked."}
{"text":"We used Tacos Al Carbon for a work event and they did NOT disappoint. Seriously the BEST tacos ever! The owner is super awesome too!"}
{"text":"Great tacos! I would recommend to anyone. They are huge tacos and they come with big amount of meat, guacamole, pico, and cheese! They are delicious! Only reason why I didn't give them 5 stars is because a guy( apparently friends with the owners) parked his truck right in front of the food truck and played his music so very loud we had to leave ! I mean really, scaring customers away lol, people passing by we also very disturbed. So... hopefully next time that friend is not there or at least playing his music so so sooo loud, did I mention it was super loud? Well, I will make a u turn if he is. Anyway, food flavor is a 10! Service was meh! But not bad so overall 4/5"}
{"text":"Our 2 second time her. We had 8  tacos de lengua they stay good. But what makes it look bad is there service. We have gone to other places and everyone gives great customer services. We will not return here there service was so bad."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about two times but the past four times that I've tried to come and order, they always tell me they are closed. If your lights are on and you say you close at 12, stand behind it please. I'm tired of going and being turned away every time. Not worth the trip"}
