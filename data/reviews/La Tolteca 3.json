{"text":"I've been to every single La Tolteca. The first one in Portage, easily my favorite and it's the original to the small more intimate one in Sun Prairie. I didn't care for the Sun Prairie location but that's another review. This one is very close to the Portage location in terms of service, quality of food and speed of service.   We ventured in tonight around 530 and their was only a few tables filled. I wasn't surprised as I know the few Mexican restaurants that filled this location prior had trouble getting customers in the door. Either way if the folks in Western Dane County wanted some decent Mexican cuisine they should go here. It's better then Middleton's Abuelo's and Mi Cocina which says a lot. The prices are fair and they had 20 oz margaritas for 4.99 tonight.. Good luck finishing those puppies. I ordered the Quesadilla Fajita-Chicken and it was fantastic, it was served with Guacamole, Sour Cream, Lettuce, and Pico de Gallo. Everything was fantastic about this entree. My fiancee ordered the Seafood Chimichanga and she liked it. She said it was very filling and had trouble finishing her margarita. We used to always frequent Mi Cocina in Middleton, however this is my designated Mexican restaurant now. Give it a try you will like it."}
{"text":"As a resident of Cross Plains, there aren't a lot of local eateries, so it was nice to have La Tolteca come to town.  The timing was good as the west side Pedro's (my wife's favorite) had recently shut down.  We tried La Tolteca and found it to be very good.  Is it the *best* Mexican we've had?  No, but it's VERY good.  We've had the tacos, enchiladas, fajitas and burritos - all are tasty and the price is very fair.  That staff at La Tolteca are very friendly - they are always making us comfortable while waiting for carry-out.  As a family-owned business, they have a lot of interest in making sure the customers are satisfied.  In summary - La Tolteca is fast, easy, delicious, and affordable.  They're a regular stop for our family."}
{"text":"The food was very good (I had a quesadilla and rice, which was yummy). I wish they had jamaica and horchata, but the portions were large for a low price. Service was great and the place seemed very clean. I'd definitely go there again."}
