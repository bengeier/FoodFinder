{"text":"At first I thought their menu was a little pricey for the standard 'Bistro' fare, but, wow the food EXCEPTIONAL for the price. So far I have had the hot wings, rail burger, chicken sandwich, spicy chicken and the veggie panini sandwich... all were extremely tasty.   The only criticism I have is that parking can be a major PITA if it's your first time.   First time? Get the 'Rail Burger.' ... Just amazing."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the price is reasonable, and the staff are warm and welcoming.  One of the best restaurants I've been to. It's quiet enough to have a conversation with your party and the lighting and decor work perfectly to provide an intimate yet casual ambiance.   The food is to die for. I have tried a couple different things from the menu and have yet to be disappointed. The appetizer portions are huge, enough for two.  The wait time to be seated, and served is quite good as well. I went on a Saturday at 6:00pm recently and only had to wait 5 minutes to be seated. The food arrives in a reasonable amount of time.   The Rail has made it onto my favourite restaurant list, and I hope they will be around for a long time."}
{"text":"Great place to go or to order. They have a bit of everything (pasta, ribs, pizza, breakfast). And because it is on the reserve, there are no taxes, so it is usually cheaper to eat there."}
{"text":"A real bargain for midnight upscale munchies. In a crunch, why would anyone go to La Banquise 24H when you have this?  The Diablo Calamari ($9) with bell peppers and onions in a tomato sauce was A1. Amazing flavour combination. The burger was less impressive though: a little over-salted and sausage-like. Very generous plate though with a good amount of salad that isn't calorie-filled. The casino-level service was impeccable, and so was the atmosphere. Mohawk territory so no taxes.  Potential for a 5-star, contingent on a good main dish which I'll surely find."}
{"text":"Ate at the Rail a few times during our visit to Playground. What a pleasant surprise - absolutely great good. For lunch one day we ordered a club sandwich and a spicy chicken sandwich. Both were really really good, but the spicy chicken sandwich was \"to die for\"! We also had breakfast here 2 mornings and enjoyed ourselves very much. For breakfast we recommend the eggs benny and fruit crepe (with sprinkles!). Our only complaint was that the coffee was a bit on the weak side. We will definitely eat here again, no question."}
{"text":"Supper was very uninspired. Salmon too  Pasta undercooked -  and soggy old grease fries with salmon.  No love in the food. I've done breakfast here countless times and it's OK.  But beyond that - the pizza is probably your best bet."}
{"text":"Le \"tout Chateauguay\" et Kanawake viennent y faire leur tour! Cheap prices for good, basic food for breakfast and slightly \"fancier\" stuff for 24 hour service. On peut y manger à volonté, gratuitement, si on joue au poker dans la salle d'à côté. Nice staff, polite, smiling, quick to help, un endroit pour se retrouver entre amis."}
{"text":"Great food! First two times the food and service were excellent.. The third time great food but the service was not.. The waiter took down our order wrong and messed it all up. The manager fixed everything."}
{"text":"I seriously adore this place.   The food is always delicious! Always made perfectly! Always served quickly!! And prices include taxes. The selection is always fantastic too...though they have yet again changed up their menu a bit so now some of my favorites have disappeared. (For example The Rail Shepherd's Pie: Gone! Fried chicken with chorizo: Gone! Spinach dip: Gone! Mexican poutine: Gone!) but still some reliable faves on the menu: indian taco, avocado wrap,   the rail burger, the pizzas... Which i highly recommend, especially the Indian Taco! Also, lookin forward to trying their new pork chop plate n their new black bean dip appetizer!   I love that they are open 24h! I love the decoration and the ambiance, it's like a chameleon restaurant: it can be what u need it to be. Example: on a date night? All the sudden the place feels nice n classy... Just wana come out for some wings n football? Now it's a sports bar! Family reunion? Now it's a reception hall!  The high ceilings and gigantic poker hall adjacent make it sound a little echo-ey in here but this ends up being a good thing for 2 reasons: 1- You can tune in and out of the music playing depending on if u like the song quite easily. 2- It makes it so even if ur sitting quite close to other patrons u can't much hear their conversations.   Just fyi: poker players eat free here, and from my understanding, as much as they want.   I come here often for breakfast (which is the best breakfast anywhere!) with friends and family: this place has gotten ridiculously popular for breakfast (with good reason) so try and reserve in advance. They're busy too around dinner time, but quiet back down around 10pm ish. So if ur lookin for a nice quiet meal i suggest after 10pm.   The new menu seems to suggest they're falling into a bit of a hipster vibe...but i expect this will be a temporary fad.  Definitely recommend!! Will keep comin back! Again n again n again!"}
{"text":"Now...i do not understand how i have lost my Dukedom to this place...or my photos or review, alas, as someone who went a few times a week for YEARS i had over 130 check ins on both the Rail Bistro and the old Wood Fire page.   Whatever.   Go for breakfast, fast service and the ladies there are a delight and will spoil you, so tip them well. You wont find a better deal on or off the island on omelettes with this much in them and the potatoes will never disappoint."}
{"text":"J'adore!  Pas cher du tout, un service impeccable et très attentionné. Ex: une amie prend mon citron pour le mettre dans son eau et la serveuse nous a amené une petite assiette avec des citrons. :) Très bien tenu!   Réserver le vendredi c plein!!!!"}
{"text":"We were a party of three and all plates were amazing. Smoked salmon, waffle Benedict, eggs and bacon. . Highly recommended. Seven a beautiful wait staff"}
