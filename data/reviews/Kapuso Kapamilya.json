{"text":"$3 for a CAN of soda  and then they charge extra on top of that to use your debit card? $8 for a shot of Patron is fair.  You'd think with all that extra cash they would put some decent furniture in the place. Food and service was not bad though"}
{"text":"It feels homie here. Sometimes more privacy and cheaper than private karaoke that charges $50 an hour. I will say eating here never got me sick. I like the \"Inihaw na Baboy\" sometimes I like to order the fish that's cut in a half and grilled with tomatoe salsa stuffings. \"Inihaw na Bangus\" I love the customer service that JhayZin gives. It's busy taking care of everyone even when it's busy. Still entertains us even if we are \"makulit\"  it's the place to chill from Monday - Tuesday - Wednesday it's not busy and more songs to sing. :D . DJ Kim is so sweet. She never even take breaks. She still punches in our songs. The owner is as sweet as JhayZin. Like mother like daughter oops I mean son lol. XD."}
{"text":"I have come here a few times to watch my friends sing karaoke. It's a great plate ole bar."}
{"text":"I had the kare-kare, which was delicious, but was charged extra for rice, and the tip was added to the bill.  And I was eating by myself!  I did not feel like arguing about the added tip, but decided to warn all others about their practice."}
{"text":"Best place to chill. The staff is great and love the Deejay!!!! Good food, good music!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting such good authentic FIlipino food at a Karaoke joint, but I had one of the best kare-kare everrrrrr for dinner there!"}
{"text":"It was our first time eating here. We're from the bay area, where there are a lot of great Pinoy restaurants. We ordered bulalo. The soup tasted more like vietnamese or chinese. It was overly seasoned. The fishballs were nothing special as well. I'm only giving it 2 stars because of the grilled squid. The taste was nothing fancy, the way I want my grilled squid to be, just stuffed with onions and tomatoes and seasoned with salt and pepper. We were the only party from 7-8:30 pm on a Tuesday. By far, Filipino restaurants in the bay area are far more superior. To be fair, it was the only pinoy resto we tried on our 6-day stay. Will definitely try the others when we get back."}
{"text":"Love coming to this place. Friendly staff great food and great karaoke. It's a great place to hang out at if you want a low maintenance relaxed fun evening. Jhayzin is a great host very friendly and very outgoing."}
{"text":"I just think it's a load of crap that someone can enter into the karaoke competition STILL,  after 4 rounds? If they were still looking for more candidates, then they shouldn't have made the other rounds mandatory for those who were already in.
I think it's crap that there were 6 more rounds which meant a total of 10, but when I asked before I entered, I was told that there was only going to be 3 or 4.
I also thought it was odd that on Saturday (competition nights were Wednesday) I texted \"Kuya Ray\" & asked if I made it to the next round, & was replied with a \"yes,\" then the very next day, I text \"Kuya Ray\" another question regarding the karaoke contest,  but this time he had no idea who I was?
I would have continued if it all wasn't so shady, fishy, & suspicious.
Also, the 1st time I sang,  our tab had drinks that weren't ours. Only reason I came back was because of the karaoke comp. But now I realize it's just that whole bar. Your customer service sucks. A thousand thumbs down."}
{"text":"Fun place to go to on a Saturday evening... Reminds me so much of how much fun Filipinos have singing karaoke & sharing a meal with special friends & family! Thanks Kapamilya  will be back with more friends on our next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"I just wanna say that this is one of the best places to relax and socialize, if you are looking for a chill night. Because of the bar (with many selective drinks and beer) and also  the karaoke stand that they have. 

One of the best Filipino dishes out here in Vegas, and the location is very convenient if you are out of town, because it is located in Spring Mountain (Chinatown) and very close to the Vegas Strip and the Fashion Show Mall.

Also the staffs are wonderful and friendly, really great vibe. Especially Jheyzin and Kim. They know what customer service stands for and what value truly means; I appreciate it, that each time I go here, they always welcome me and make me feel more at home! (: 

If I can give this more than 5 star I deff would!! I recommend anyone looking for a great time and variety of Filipino dishes and drinks to come here!! 

Thank You Kapamilya Kapuso!! You guys are great!"}
{"text":"i worked there as a karaoke dj for 6 months. only got paid 6.25 an hour but they used to let me have 2 drinks and a free meal every night i work. first they took away drinks, then food, then had the nerve to dock my pay for when we close early or for drinks i didn't order."}
{"text":"My Favorite place to Hangout, Relax, & enjoy the Filipino Food while listening to the Music."}
{"text":"If Yelp gave me the option of giving this place ZERO stars? I wouldn't hesitate to rate it as that. This place is absolutely terrible, the service was subpar and the food was unbelievably over-priced for the amount of food you get. Please please please, who ever is reading my review? Save your money and take your business elsewhere because I can guarantee you that even MCDONALDS has better food? AND service than this atrocious place. And if you didn't know, IM COMPARING IT TO A FAST FOOD PLACE."}
{"text":"Recently returned to this establishment an it is worse than ever. The service remains a joke, the products offered ($3 cokes and $3 waters) is insane considering the area of town as well as the environment. There used to be a much better clientele at this establishment that actually spent money and gave the place a touch of class. The food servers are poorly trained and have no sense of urgency or passion for service. It is simply a karaoke room with some Christmas lights that are never taken down. I must agree with Sharon Lee that it is a smaller version of Cafe Moda which is hardly a compliment. This could go on and on - - -"}
{"text":"I'm a little upset that Kapuso has lower ratings on yelp because I feel that's very unfair for them. 

This establishment is me and my friend's go-to for small birthday party celebrations, post clubbing, or anytime I just feel like I need a drink. Their drinks are cheap, their food is cheap, there is karaoke, what more can I ask for? The staff is friendly, the owner is a nice old filipina lady. The main bartender Jhayzen is a great entertainer, you won't get bored ever. 

It's packed on the weekends, but more chill during the weekday. They have a full bar. They serve all the filipino food I can think of, so I believe there is a lot of value at Kapuso. They have been in business for decades so I know they are doing something correct. 

I highly recommend them for special occasions."}
{"text":"We always go to this place and love the place until tonight.. Me and 2 of my other friends went after drinking all night we wanted to eat and sing karaoke.. After my friends were done singing and the bartender i think her name is LAURA or something like that (first time I saw her working there), started screaming complaining about my friends singing yelling that her ears hurts because my friends were singing so loud.. Where does she think she works at? At the library?! It's a karaoke bar and people are drunk and sings song sometimes terribly.. She's a bartender she needs to deal with that and not disrespect paying customers.. She was yelling and screaming that she was annoyed of my friends singing because they're too loud and she even said that they suck.. She works there! She's a bartender, in a karaoke bar!  She acts like she owns the place! I personally know the owner and they're very nice.. I don't even know why she works there if she can't handle loud, drunk customers who's trying to have fun.. I was the next person to sing, I was in the stage singing and she still yelling and screaming and complaining.. i went off the stage, cancelled our orders and went to eat next door.. We are paying customers, DO NOT disrespect us! Will never go back there when she is working.. She is bad for the business and trust me, people will know about what we experienced last Friday night.."}
{"text":"This place is not great by any means. The bar food is terrible. It's Filipino style karaoke, meaning you have to wait a long time before you get a chance to sing, because you have the typical K hogs. Don't get me wrong, I am used to places like Q and Bazic, but this place just feels sleazy and PI bar-esque. I went here with friends that knew the owners son and I still didn't have a good experience. Sorry Kapuso."}
{"text":"food here is ok.
I recommend chicken wing.
however,  didn't have a good experience singing here.
 if you are first time here don't  expect to sing as many song as their regular customer


the DJ seemed nice and friendly at first.  there's only 3 to 4 tables there but we waited a long time and only get to sing one song since we had to leave soon and had been waiting for another 30 minutes so I asked my mom to tip the DJ and see if she can play another song for us before we leave but seem like she thinks that we are not tipping her enough so she had a look in her eye.  and made us wait even longer for the 2nd song.  she even play some dance songs when no one there is dancing to make us wait longer."}
{"text":"Cheap Beer and the give complimentary peanuts at the bar! 

Went to check out the place while I was on my way to get my parked car and noticed the sign that said \"karaoke\" and I just couldn't resist it.  I walked in and the place was nice and dark inside. It has a lounge area off to the left side of the building where you can have parties or what not for big groups of people. The ambience is nice. They have a nice variety of alcohol, considering its a filipino bar (usually they don't have much).  

They have filipino songs, but I didn't really go there for that. It's your typical karaoke joint. You tell the DJ what song you want to sing, he can look it up for you. The binder doesn't have nearly what they have on their computer and wastes paper. So just ask him and he will gladly look for it for you. 

Definitely will come back in the future, with friends... 

The only negative, is that, they had a couple odd singers in there.. which made it funny at first, then got annoying quick. And if you're a karaoke whore like me, this is not one of those places where you can feel like you sound good, because you will barely be able to hear yourself sing."}
{"text":"Came here for a Monday night with friends.  The food is very good, we split a pork noodle plate and some type of egg rolls as a table.  It was light enough for an after dinner snack, but filling at the same time that we didn't over-eat.

The place wasn't crowded so we were able to get up and sing several times throughout the evening.  The song book had a lot of mis-translated American titles with incomplete artist information, however I know they aren't necessarily catering to an American crowd so I understand!

This was a fun change from our normal hangout spot and I'd come back with a large group."}
{"text":"Best place to hang-out!!!! The food is good and the sound system is perfect and great service and the all stuff is very friendly ."}
{"text":"The food was not worth the money. Little portions for high prices! The rice was extremely hard. Definitely won't go back."}
{"text":"JhayZin is one of the best bar tender in Las Vegas! Best customer service! Really cool person! always updated to her drinks and also very socialized!!! Always making sure her customer is feeling comfortable and active! Can't go wrong to his place!!! You must look for jhayzin!!!! Best 10/10 service!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is shady. The menu said $5 drinks and she charged $8 a drink instead. I brought this up to her and she was rude and dismissive, and would not honor that price. Avoid these hustlers, your wallet will thank you. It was also too hot."}
{"text":"The Karaoke is here is fun, they have tons of songs its a Filipino owned business as are the staffed and most of the guests. They serve some great Filipino food here too, I love the Crispy Pata. Full Bar with a kitchen, Nice Staff, there very welcoming to non Filipinos and I have never seen any drama here like fights etc. I recommend this place to my friends who I know like to Karaoke."}
{"text":"Yelp 365 Challenge #152/365 (Las Vegas Adventures in July) 


This was my tip as I checked in: DJ Angel has a voice...make sure you know how to sing too...

It's true, you better know how to sing because this DJ can SING. However, call me bias but my niece who sang the last night we were in Vegas rivaled the DJ's voice. 

Anyhoo! My husband and I don't do karaoke not because we do not drink but because we just never did care for karaoke. However, our family has some talented singers and musicians. And this is what the older crowd chose to do while the younger crowd decided to take on the rides at New York New York.

This place is a filipino owned business (hence, the filipino name). Around this area is what I would call asian city because right across the street there are various asian eats (thailand, japanese, korean) with Kapuso beckoning across the street for anyone to sing after eating. 

I almost missed Kapuso and was about to whip my rental car around the parking lots but my husband pointed out that it was across the street.

I gritted my teeth, smiled nicely and drove into the little parking lot. As I stepped out of the car, the sign blared up brightly at us. My first thought was \"Ugh...a karaoke BAR\" but hey...last night with the family that we may not see again for awhile, so we stepped in. 

Your typical karaoke bar with a dance floor *eyebrow raised*. Our nieces and nephews waved at us from the back. All I could think of is \"I'm hungry..is it just filipino pupus?\" 

Our waiter didn't come right away to where my husband had to grab menus. 

I was not in the mood to eat filipino food but I chose their shanghai lumpia when I was actually craving for...pulehu steak, fries, soybeans, and chicken! But, I settled for the shanghai lumpia because you can't go wrong with that appetizer.

As we listened to everyone sing, we found out that next door was for dancing. As we sat there and was wowed by our nieces and nephews, I noticed that they have a great list of  songs from different genres (filipino to contemporary pop, rock or R&B). Another thing I noticed is that the DJ would deliberately place herself on the lineup list for individuals who were singing. 

IMHO...if there are alot of people coming here to sing, can Kapuso minimize the amount of times that the DJ sings? Yes, granted she is talented but I don't know. It started to seem like she was showboating especially after I noticed she would deliberately sing after anyone who sang really well just to try and \"one up\" on them. I kept thinking that hopefully someone will nominate her to be on \"The Voice\"

Anyhow, overall experience was okay. The family time spent there is what upped my rating to four stars.

If you like dimly lit karaoke bars, this is a place for you.

If you want to listen to everyone including the DJ sing, this is the place for you

If you are craving filipino food and want to sing Dahil Say Yo afterwards? This place is for you

If you want to dance the favorite filipino party dances (macarena, ocho ocho, electric slide), then yes, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"WHAT A BUNCH OF CROOKS !
Our group of 23 people ordered trays of food. To cut the story short, they tried to charge us over $900 dollars. When we audited what we ordered it was only $719 including tax. We tried to pay with credit card but the manager said it does not work, we tried 2 different cards still no luck and they insist on us paying cash. All food was pre ordered 2 days before but we still have to wait a loooong time for each item to be served. I'm talking 20 minutes in between each item.  The amount of food were really small for the price they charge. One example is the pancit with no meat for $50 that is good for 4 people. 
The food was really bad, the place was soooooo dirty. They have one man and one woman toilet for over 100 people. That has no toiletries. They used paper plates and tiny plastic spoon and forks. They don't refill iced tea (3 scoops of Neastea brand from Costco) and charge $15 for a pitcher. Even the servers admit that the manager is a cheat! WE WILL
NEVER SET FOOT ON THIS ESTABLISHMENT EVER AGAIN.
This establishment doesn't even deserve a 1 star review but this is the lowest yelp offers."}
{"text":"Randomly wound up here with some friends. Overall everything was great. We ordered sisig, soup, and chicken everything tasted good, no complaints about the good at all. Friends had a great time doing the karaoke, and everyone (customers and staff) were enjoying themselves. Staff was attentive and always checking on the table. Drinks were easy enough to get refilled. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Shitty service. They'll only serve you if you buy a lot of drinks and food. They only gave my friend good service because hes a regular. This place is a joke. If I had a choice, I'd give this place NO STARS!!"}
{"text":"Definitely karaoke. Definitely a pub. Definitely Filipino. It's def a smaller version of Cafe Moda so I wouldn't be shocked if the two places are kaibigans. 

To me, the food and drinks are overpriced. Which doesn't shock me-its a Filipino establishment. Gotta make dat $$$ man!!!! And being Filipino, of course I'm going to think it's overpriced. 

But in all sincerity, there are other places throughout Chinatown/Spring Mtn Ville that has better karaoke (in terms of ambience), & cheaper food and drinks. 

But I do give 5 stars for wanting to lurk in dark corners because this place has ample dark corners to lurk in. Definitely where you bring your secret lover. Maybe the two of you can karaoke some \"Secret Lovers\" I know they have it cuz someone sung it. ;) ;)"}
{"text":"i like the new management now and way better compared before.. they improve  now.. The food is really good and my cocktail Apple she's really nice and Friendly.. better u come on friday and saturday.."}
{"text":"Walked in here on a Monday/Tuesday late night/early morning. This place had no customers what so ever. Walked in here and was given a dirty look no smile or gracious greeting. I expected a private room for my party, but the set up in here is a little different compared to the other karaoke places around town. It's very open with a stage, anyone was able to go up and sing their little heart out. Good thing no one was in there!!! We took a seat and ordered drinks, the only best part was the $5 drinks. Service lacked, the karaoke list was confusing, I had a reason the songs were playing were found on YouTube. 
Towards the end of our experience here was unfortunately, no bueno. Ordered a simple fried rice and it tasted very bland, the server tried charged us a drink my friend never got. We simply tried explaining to her what had happened, but she wasn't communicating with us very well. We decided to call it a night and just leave. I doubt we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Im giving a fourth star just for the Fridays and Saturdays when they have a live band perform. 

Kela (lead singer on Saturdays) has an amazing voice and the whole band performs wonderfully to 80's and 90's jams. Definitely half the size of Cafe Moda but not as dark on the inside. You still get to step up and sing some tunes though! A full bar is also offered that sits about 8 people. 

If your planning to grub on some food, menu entrees range from $7-$13 each feeding 2-3 people."}
{"text":"Jayzin, Merlinda and Malou are THE BEST! The rest can do us a favor and find a job elsewhere with their rude attitudes speaking poorly of guests in Tagalog as though I wouldn't know! I love going because it's fun, but the dirty looks and rude remarks really kill it for me."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE. CAFE MODA IS UP THE STREET.

-FOOD WAS WAAYY OVERPRICED AND POORLY MADE. I ordered the chicken wings and is was basically bone and skin. Pancit was dry hardly any meat just noodles and veggies. Portions are small for the price. 

-THE DJ HAHAHA. tipping is something that shouldn't be expected. especially to a DJ that sits on his ass drinking sodas all night and smoking cigarettes outside. and if you don't tip him you don't sing. the employees sing most of the night which is weird...um....shouldn't you be working?

-THE PLACE ITSELF...SHAKE MY HEAD...I stepped into the the twilight zone. its Christmas, a zoo, a Circus all in one when you step in. Christmas lights all over trying to make it look nice? Awkward paintings on the walls of clowns and fairies...like WTF am I looking at?

-HEALTH DEPARTMENT PLEASE VISIT. no disposable seat covers so as a women I was forced to stand up squat and pee. lol."}

I am definitely a KAPUSO fan! Hahaha! This is me and my friends go-to place everytime we can't decide where to go. Lol! Drinks can be so expensive at the clubs, so we always come here to pregame. Even post clubbing! When we get tired of dancing the night away, we'll go straight here and sing our hearts out loud! Great and friendly staff here especially Jhayzin! He's the man! Or should I say, SHE's the man! The vibe here is always positive unless there's someone who tries to do a concert there, meaning a person who sings a song after a song. Give everyone a break! Lol

Food is delicioso! I loooove their calamari, squid, and ginataan! 

Whenever I have friends in town, I always bring them here to grub authentic pinoy food or just to drink and lounge."}

Took the food back and told to her cook \" Larry \" but Rowena came back and told me that Larry is getting mad and we have to pay for the beef bistek and cancel the sinigang na baboy only ; I replied to her that both are tough to eat and both needs to be cancelled we will not pay for it. I told Rowena I'll stalk to your manager and she said no manager available instead I spoke to Larry who's a cook I approached him and told him that the meat was tough to eat and I'm not going to pay for it besides been waiting for 31 minutes and his reply \" I'm the only one who's cooking \" I told him is that how you deal to your customers instead of apologizing, take care of the food right and take care of it but instead he is as arguing to me. Larry is very rude just because his the owner relative will definitely report this to the higher which is The better business bureau cause those meat that Larry serve you know it's not fresh looks like been there for two weeks never will come back to this place and the owner Melinda needs improvement and to take care of this issue and train her staff how to cook the food right. Lastly Rowena is great she handled it well. Not recommending this place"}

And I ordered soda taste like shit too they need to replace the fountain coke box in the box or buy the cans atleast smh.  The food was alright just love coming for the fishballs."}
{"text":"Went here at night and the food was okay. Service was on and off since it looked like they wanted to have fun instead of servicing their customers. The singing ruined my appetite since it was mostly the employee singing the whole time. The setting for the place did not really fit the theme since it had laser lights, top 40s music, some paintings that look like were bought from a swapmeet and unorganized seating areas. The price for food was way overpriced! I knew we should have went across the street and gotten something better at a reasonable price.."}

Big rip off, never going back..."}
{"text":"WOULD NOT COME HERE AGAIN. The rice took about 20 minutes to come out and it wasn't even fresh. It was hard. The prices were excessive for such small portions. Customer service was lacking. The server only came to take orders and drop off food. However, I saw her visit certain tables several times. There was absolutely no regulation- another customer was smoking inside the bathroom and tossed his bud on the floor right next to my table. Honestly, you're better off at Cafe Moda. It's open just has late and has similar features, but better."}

{"text":"Karaoke calamity, this little hole in the wall has its purpose but I'm not sure what it is. They will run themselves out of business if they don't start treating newcomers better. They cater to friends and family. I even tipped the DJ Adobo well and he still sent his buddies ahead of me in the karaoke list. The sleazy tattooed oversized Filipina tending bar was curt, unaware, inattentive, and preferred to text on her phone to actually working. When the older middle aged ladies work, it's a better place. The young man with the fake diamond earring and the big painted lady behind the bar run the place with DJ Adobo, it's a joke. The restrooms are filthy and you may need antibiotics after using them. Everything is over priced. Eat elsewhere and have drinks before you get there. Don't bother tipping the DJ because he's going to ignore you anyway. I hope Bar Rescue hits this place. I wanna see Taffer go head-to-head with SheRa, Queen of the dive bars. Wait for the nice older ladies who run and own the place. It's a good place to feel unwanted.

Update: I haven't seen the mean bartender lady the last couple of times I was there. The lady running the karaoke was great! Such a difference, this place is much more welcoming."}
