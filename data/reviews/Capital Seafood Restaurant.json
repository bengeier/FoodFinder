{"text":"Very good Vietnamese/Chinese restaurant near the Las Vegas strip. Our group ordered: Bo luc lac (Shaking beef), canh chua, braised duck, salt and pepper pork, ca co tho (braised fish in clay pot), and a few pounds of Lobster. All the dishes we ordered were spectacular. It was a very scrumptious meal and the portions were decent. Always feel satisfied and fulfilled after eating here. Def one of my favorite restaurants when I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Went for lunch around 2:30. Kinda slow not many customers. Service like other reviews was really slow, not attentive and they all had a \"I want to be somewhere else attitude\".

I got a combination bahn mi. When it arrived I picked it up and the bread was warm. :-)

I bit into a crunchy, soft and crispy sandwich. Yummy. The veggies were really fresh, the meat had flavor and there was just enough heat to get my attention.

If the service had been better so would the rating be."}
{"text":"We moved here from Oregon and had not been able to find a Chinese restaurant that we liked until trying Capital Seafood.  My hubby and I shared 3 different dishes and the flavors absolutely exploded in our mouths.  We couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  We had Yang Chow Fried Rice (best we've ever had), the Fried Squid and a Chow mien dish.  And we had enough left over for two full lunches.  Unbelievable!  We're going back tonight.  We want to try new dishes but don't want to miss out on the ones we already had, so we'll flip a coin.   Flavor, flavor, flavor.  And reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Ordentlich. Flott. Unkompliziert. Und Wein und Bier gibt es auch. Basta. 
Es ist halt auf schnelle Abfertigung ausgerichtet, was der Qualität nicht wirklich gut tut. 
Aber in der Wüste ist jeder Grashalm willkommen."}
{"text":"It was decent. We really wanted pho, which happened to be attached to this Chinese restaurant.  The pho was \"meh\", because the broth was bland. I also ordered the beef chow fun, which was pleasantly good, but it was missing the gravy that wanted.  

If you happen to stop in, I recommend ordering from the Chinese menu. It seem to be more of the specialty than the Vietnamese menu."}
{"text":"The hot and sour fish cost $24.99 not $7.45 light the guy say. Service is really bad."}
{"text":"Is this place kidding me?! $90 for lobster noodles?! Only a 3 pound lobster.... Uhh.. Go across the plaza to Harbor Palace.. Their 3 pound lobster noodle was only $38 (varies by season) and they have specials! Today was buy one get one free lobster.. Such a steal!"}
{"text":"Always like coming here for good authentic Chinese/Vietnamese/Cambodian food. We ordered their family meals for $80 you get salt and pepper shrimp, big pot of hot and sour soup (your choice of Vietnamese or Thai style), stir fry calm with sweet basil and jalapeños and the whole sweet and sour fried whole some fish. I have also ordered their pho too and it's very delicious and tasty. After your meal they serve a small bowl of sweet desert. We been coming here every time we visit Vegas. Service could be a hit or miss today took them 15 mins to come take our orders due to a large loud party behind us. We will come back when we visit again."}
{"text":"Not a very good experience.  The decor is boring and plain.  Our host/waiter was typical no-personality poor service expected from a Chinese waiter.  Except for filling our teapot one time, no one asked about our food, if we wanted anything else, etc.  We had to ask for the bill at the end of our meal.

As for the food?  We originally ordered 4 dishes from the MENU. Three were not available.  We were notified after our order was placed that two of the three were not available (at different times I may add), requiring us to look at the menu three times to choose 4 dishes that were available.  We had shrimp cakes that tasted like crab, and pork, so were either very old or they just didn't want to come back and tell us the shrimp cakes were also out of stock.  The \"porkchops\" were salty, looked more like short ribs.  The only dish that was tasty was the green beans.  

Finally, they gave us a family style bowl of rice without our ordering it.  $2.00 was then added to the bill for two orders of rice.  Since they did not charge for the hot tea, I paid without complaining and my party did eat the rice.  The total for the rice and 4 dishes, two of which were only vegetables was over $61.49.

I would not recommend this place for ambiance, food, service or price and will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food was a 2 stars... Plus one of the waiters was really RUDE!! I just assume he was having a bad day.."}
{"text":"Got here the other night and ordered lobster in butter sauce, garlic ongchoy and vegetable fried rice. The food were good I don't taste msg in it. The service was good too compare with other typical Chinese restos."}
{"text":"Substandard Chinese food and unethical business practices.  The restaurant gets one star for the excellent service by the serving staff.

Our family of 6 came for dinner on Christmas night.  We had the house special fish, fried chicken, salt & pepper tofu, special seafood-tofu pot, sautéed green beans and sautéed Chinese spinach.  The food was below average - the fish was mushy and not very fresh, and the fried tofu was over done.  A large number of our family lives in the San Gabriel Valley in Los Angeles, CA, so we know good Chinese and Vietnamese food.  This restaurant would never make it in the SGV.

Worst of all, the cashier/management was highly unethical.  Our dinner was around $90, and the itemized receipt, which added in both tax of about $10 and a 15% service charge of about $14, came to just over $114.  We provided a credit card, and when the charge slip came, the \"new total\" was $144, an extra $30 higher!!!   The itemized receipt was also gone from the little folio.

We went up to the cashier counter to ask a for copy of the itemized receipt again, and sure enough, the tip was already in the original total of $114, and the $30 was secretly added on.  When we pointed this out to the cashiers, we weee quickly told, \"Oh, this was a typo, we will cancel this charge and issue you a corrected charge slip.\"  No apologies.  We had been fully ready to tip extra due to the holidays and the hard working servers, but NOT after this unethical shenanigan.  

Go elsewhere for good Chinese food, or if you must eat here, check your receipt and charge slips carefully for more \"errors.\"  Consumer beware."}
{"text":"Ok food but very bad service. We ordered porridge along with other food, after all food came, we asked the server to check for porridge, the answer was there will be five more minutes. Another 15 minutes after, we asked the server again,  the answer is do you still want it?  Someone forgot your order but now it's ready. We said bring it, guess what? The porridge was not done! We complaint to the manager, he did not even say sorry!  after we paid the meal yet we are still hungry, I went to talk to the manager and said this is not acceptable. Then finally he apologized but also arguing that they opened late they were too busy to get food ready?!!!"}
{"text":"im a big fan of Capital Seafood in so cal, Garden Grove tops them off, In my opinion, the one in Vegas is a bit more pricey then their California counter parts, and not to mention a tad less professional. \" due to a father son feud that happened when my family tried this establishment. As for their food, there is nothing special about capital seafood Vegas."}
{"text":"I love this place, located on the main center of Chinatown on the second floor near 99 ranch market. They have two restaurants in the same building one being capital seafood and the other being pho Vietnamese, so whoever your waiter is will hand you two separate menus one for each restaurant. Food is amazing I love it  the portions are pretty decent, staff is very friendly and the ambiance is very settle. I totally recommend this place if you wanna have a nice dinner with family, friends, or maybe a one on one date."}
{"text":"Good food, bad service. Our pho was tasty, but it was missing saw leaf (aka culantro) and a few of the Thai basil leaves were dark spotted. After our meals were served, the wait staff blatantly ignored us and we had to ask for the check. 

This may very well be our last time in Chinatown after a long absence from eating out in general. It used to be the cool place in Vegas to eat and shop at a good price. These days our experiences have been very negative. We've visited a few restaurants in this area and the same scenario plays out: non-American Asians and the few whites around are treated well; and everyone else F.U. 

What started out as a small enclave in the Westside where anyone could come as they were has now unofficially become \"Asian only\" in certain establishments. I guess the Asian tour buses in Chinatown Plaza take the place of other customers (local or not). This type of segregation reminds me of rural America and plays a big role in ruining the once vibrant spirit of Las Vegas. I was not raised to separate myself from others who are different than myself; and I find this new ambiance very jarring and disturbing. 

My advice is to observe the clientele and interactions to determine which places will be a right fit. It is not advisable to just \"walk in.\"

On another note, their credit card receipt looks ambiguous because the lines for pre-tip amount and tip amount were almost the same. One needs to be careful and clear when filling out and signing their credit card info on the merchant's copy."}
{"text":"I always come by here to get my asian quick fix every trip to Vegas! Customer service and food quality is always on point!"}
{"text":"Came here after Mother's Korean disaster and am thrilled. Had house squid special, pea shoots and green beans. Server stopped us from ordering another entree because it would be too much food and she was right !  Delicious flavors, enough food  for 2-3 more meals and great service. We will be back with pleasure!!"}
{"text":"Everything was good! We ordered walnut shrimp, Lau canh chua, green beans, duck with buns, fried calamari. We actually had too much food left over!"}
{"text":"A chinese/vietnamese restaurant.  Cheap prices and good portions. We eat here at least 4 times a month.  The Pho is good.  We typically stick to the soup, which is especially good for the Vegas hang-over. 

  We have a couple of favorites, but will let you decide, keep in mind that on holidays they have a limited menu when it comes to Pho soup (mostly Chinese food) .  They have large party seating, with a Lazy Susan, which allows a chance for multiple dishes and easy access with just a spin.  

  We live on the south end of Vegas, but have found that the drive is worth it.  Compared to a few spots that are close to home this place has delicious Pho.... Would give it a five, but the service has lacked at times, once they serve you a dish you suddenly disappear."}
{"text":"This is one of the things I miss in Vegas! I love this place! Food tastes great and price is reasonable. We always eat here when we're in town."}
{"text":"this place is just ok.... the food sometimes comes to your table lukewarm, I would prefer having my dim sum steaming hot! The price is ok, but they need to fix the issues"}
{"text":"Ate Sunday night dinner at Capital Seafood. Very disappointed. The chicken was over cooked and dry.  Beef dish was cooked in an unknown sauce with too much onions. A Seafood casserole dish did not contain much seafood at all. The only passable dish was the snow pea pod vegetables.  Came with visiting friends from foreign. Will not return or recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered the com tam plate and my friend got the beef chow fun. I had mines with pork chop, which was cooked and tasted well. The egg loaf was definitely not freshly made. The orange crust over the top was hard and it seems like it have been sitting out for while. I'm not ordering off the vietnamese menu here. On the other hand, the beef chow fun was tasty. For the price you pay, they mount the noodles with the right amount of meat and veggies. Just stick to the regular Chinese menu and I'm sure it's A-OK."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I came to this restaurant with absolutely no expections. I honestly was craving some good vermicelli and Pho Kim Long had a really long wait... pressed on time we came here out of convenience. Thinking back, I would have been better off with panda or some other form of fast food... 

My Food Review-

I ordered a beef vermicelli bowl... which really was just average.
In addition I decided to add to my order beef chow fun, but of course I specified no veggies... come to find out it came with a sauce that i was not a big fan of. So i kindly asked to have it remade. This is where the issue began... after having, who I think is a manager, come to yell at me, I also had the waitress come to me to... both times they showed me the menu but I  still could not see an issue since it did not say anywhere in English that it came with a pool of super saturated gravy.... so eventually the order comes out -this time there are veggies - which I had been very clear to them before they placed the order... so at this point I didn't complain... I simply spent a good portion of my time taking most of it out.... meanwhile, I had the staff walk past me ignoring me completely.... 

Conclusion-

Food was below average and the service is not any better. Places should respect what you order if you are paying. Let alone, want to enjoy a potentially good meal. My recommendation, go somewhere that is actually delicious and has good service!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here! 
We just had lunch here, I found a Roach in our soup, I showed it to the waitress, she said : 
\"Oh, sorry. you don't have to pay the meal.\" 
This means there are a lot ROACHES in their kitchen, and they know it. She wasn't surprise at all.
???????
?????????????????????????????????????????????????\"??????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"We often go here but today was not a good day. We order pretty much the same everytime we come and today our food was missing some ingredients. We asked the waiter and was told by 4 waiter/waitress it does not have that ingredient when the manager checked with the kitchen, our soup didn't have it cause they ran out. Customer service was definitely a thumbs down..."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends on a Wednesday night. We were immediately seated and service was very good. Waiter was very attentive and brought us all waters and hot tea for the table. 

We ordered 12 dishes for our group of 12. Dishes were a good size and were approximately ~$12 a dish. Food came out very quickly and since we were hungry eaten just as quickly. Portions were very good for the price. 

Food: 4 stars
Service: 4 stars"}
{"text":"Huge restaurant in the heart of Chinatown with so many choices of food it required two menus. Very good food and fair prices."}
{"text":"Chinese food and Pho all in the same restaurant. Great for large parties that are in need of an easy solution for a quick dinner or lunch. It always seems like we go here with a party of six plus and end up getting their family deals which cost on average of 10 dollars a head with tip. 
As far a chinese food goes, this place is typical, I wouldn't say it's the best, but it satisfies your craving for a popular dish like peking spear ribs.....or honey walnut prawns. The Pho isn't half bad either. So in review: quick, cheap, good for large parties. Just a little drive off the strip, but you'll be glad you made the drive."}
{"text":"Horrible from the moment we arrived. We were sat away from the area were Asians ate at a Formica table with no table cloth or silverware!
I ordered sizzling sea food which had 5 shrimps and the rest was mystery fish. my husband ordered crispy  duck which was so old and dried out that it was impossible to bite thru! He asked to have it replaced by cashew chicken. After an argument it came burnt!
They then tried to bill us for all three meals."}
{"text":"I had the pho chicken noodle soup and liked it a lot. My husband got mayo walnut chicken and a Bahn mi sandwich. Fast food arrival and brisk service. Good go to place!"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed with the food here and I've been coming here for a couple of years now. The food is simply phenomenal!!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a good choice if you do not want to spend lots of money in one meals.The restaurant have good selections for lunch special as well as a la carte menu.I do not like to order Mongolian beef,sweet and sour pork,wonton soup or egg drop soup or the like.I ordered seafood sizzling rice soup,salted and pepper fish fillet,whole fish with spicy and sour sauce.And every time I order the restaurant hardly let me down since the food come out quick and yummy.

The restaurant is divided into two section:Chinese and Vietnamese,so it is good if you Chinese and Vietnamese at the same time,lol.

I have tried both the Chinese and Vietnamese dishes from this restaurant,I  would say I prefer the Chinese to Vietnamese.The Chinese dishes here remind me of the dishes that I eat when I was young.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who like delicious Chinese food but with a bargain."}
{"text":"As other reviews mention, this Capital Seafood is split in half.  The left side is Vietnamese food and the right side is Chinese.  I've eaten at both.  I like their pho.  The broth is flavorful and they toss in crispy fried onions on top.  It's good and they put a lot of white meat in their chicken pho.  And the Chinese food on the right is the same I've come to expect from the Capital Seafood locations in So Cal, even though other reviewers say otherwise.  I think it's exactly the same.  The food is really good, although greasy but Chinese food usually is greasy anyway.  I like house special fried rice, garlic eggplant and house-special chicken.  Both restaurants are clean and spacious and the service is pretty standard for an Asian place."}
{"text":"Food was so so, but service was dishonest. We ordered a lobster house special and the waiter ran off and picked the largest without telling us.  The House Special Tofu was not made with fresh ingredients.  The meat was brown, old and a bit tough. The waiter knew he did something wrong because he avoided our table and let other people place the food. 

Buyer beware.  We will not be back and would not recommend this place.

My wife and I and two small kids. $140!!"}
{"text":"First time here and we ordered 2 appetizers and 2 mains. My shrimp udon wasn't bad but the shrimp rolls and fried egg...wasn't on my good side. The egg was a very thin layer and literally a whole bunch of beansprouts and burnt shrimp. There was basically no service because all the servers seemed like they were \"on breaks.\" Won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Affordable Vietnamese and Chinese cuisine with excellent service and decent venue. I ordered one of their \"tiny stick noodle\" with pork dishes = $6.75 and was very filling. The pork was good quality and not full of fatty tendon or anything."}
{"text":"First time here. Came for my brother's graduation from Med school at around 4:00 PM on a Monday. No reservations, just showed up with a group of 20 people and ordered 2 of the $195 family dinners. Came with lots of food. Food came out quickly and most importantly, everything tasted delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was defiantly small portions for wedding banquet menu. Like seriously the smallest I have ever seen. Some stuff had good flavor like the beef and crab but others were not good like Ong choy and fish. All and all it was typical. Service was pretty good though!"}
{"text":"We just wanted some noodles and I have never tried this place before, so here we are.

The noodle soup we ordered had very subtle taste, almost like water down. The crab meat that makes the whole soup sounded wonderful before we ordered was imitation crab meat, and it was not even cooked with the soup. They were thrown in before serving.

I ordered this noodle with grilled beef and shrimp cake on a sugarcane stick. They come with lettuce and fresh herbs for you to use as wraps, and this dish was actually not so bad.

I thought this place was OK, nothing special. I don't think I'll be a regular here."}
{"text":"came here with party of 9

service is okay as they have multiple servers attending the table.. they did not refill waters or tea in the first 30 minutes tho

we order the wok crab, duck, salt n pepper shrimp, beef and chicken.. the food came out promptly and we got everything we needed and the qaulity was average+

nothing to rave about but they more than adequately gets the job done"}
{"text":"Amazing Flavors. Jelly Fish was Great. Flounder, Shrimp Salad, Octopus, Stewed Crab. The food came out Family Style and there is always enough to share."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. Warning, if you're not early, you'll probably wait in line for a table. They are always packed. We ordered the ginger and green onion lobster (delicious), clam with black bean (also great), and the HK style crispy noodle with seafood. The noodle dish was just okay, the protein to noodle portion was off. There was a lot of noodle and not a lot of seafood. Service was good though. And the food came out very fast despite the place being so packed."}
{"text":"Was wondering Chinatown in Las Vegas and stumbled upon this place. The place was packed with both locals and tourist. 

The wait to be seated wasn't very long and the staff quickly took our orders. Me and my wife tried the clams with black bean sauce and the seafood claypot. Both were pretty decent, but most of the meat in the claypot was fake seafood (ie fake crab meat, fish paste). 

Overall the service was friendly and the food OK."}
{"text":"Upstairs in Chinatown Plaza is this seafood-centric spot, which shares it's space with Pho Vietnam. Considering seafood is their forte (allegedly), I expected a bit better. Menu options include fish, shellfish, crab, squid, shrimp, and even sea cucumber- basically everything that comes from the sea, plus options that don't (beef, chicken, pork).

I had a killer craving for salt and pepper shrimp (labeled here as House Special Shrimp) and found them perfectly crispy, with tons of fried green onion and jalapeno, but the actual shrimp itself was less salty and less peppery than other, more flavorful versions I've had in town.
We also got the sautéed spinach, add garlic, and found it to be tasty- comparable to the baby bok choy dish at Ichiza, except with spinach and a slightly less robust sauce. Dish was tasty but a bit gritty, as if it hadn't been adequately rinsed.

Service was typical for Chinatown plaza- you order, you receive your food, and you have to hunt them down for anything else."}
{"text":"I find it weird that 4 of my co-workers from Taiwan wanted me to take them to a Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas. I mean, they just got here and they want to have Chinese food? Haven't they had enough of that in Taiwan?

Nonetheless, I drove them to Chinatown and decided to try this place. 

The next day at the convention center, we were all in the meeting room when one of them asked me \"Do you have diarrhea?\"

Did he just ask me if I have diarrhea? I told him no. Then, another of my co-worker confirmed that he, too, has diarrhea. 

Great, a company meeting on diaarhea. Apparently,  everyone in the room had it, except me. 

One by one, they asked me if I ate this or that dish...

Co-worker 1: Did you have the spicy beef with chili peppers?
Me: Yes, it was good, spicy but good.

Co-worker 2: How about the sweet and sour fish?
Me:  Ah, I had it. It was pretty tasty and tangy.

Co-worker 3: Maybe it was the hot and sour soup.
Me: No, I had that one, too. A bit sour but still has that nice kick.

Co-worker 4: Ah, it must be the jellyfish.
Me: That, for me, was the best dish.

Finally, the President then said:  Well, then it must be the sea cucumber.
Me: Oh, that slimy, alien-looking thing? I'm Asian but I'm not that Asian.

Moral of the story: Not everything that moves is good to eat.  

Minus two stars."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a group of 12, ordered about eight different dishes to share and that was plenty of food for us. 

Two stars for big portions and the fried tofu was very delicious. Everything else was so mediocre I won't even mention the names. 

But the deal breaker was finding a long gray hair in the stir fried veggie dish. And no one has gray hair in our group so we are positive it does not belong to any of us. Gross!!! Does not recommend."}
{"text":"Really good food. The service is ok. Affordable price. At Chinatown Plaza it's the best food. I have tried the almost every other place over there."}
{"text":"We ended up in Captial Seafood Restaurant as we were looking for Pho Vietnam. It's crazy confusing as both signs are lit up all big above this restaurant area. Once in the door they have a stack of menus for both restaurants. They then ask you which one you want. We looked around and everyone was eating Seafood, so we punted and went with the Seafood. 

Everyone around us were locals. The prices were great and the food was pretty good. Actually two of the dishes we had were great: bok choy with mushrooms and salt & pepper squid. Both cooked perfectly - not overcooked and really flavorful. We also got the crab appetizer - which was a special. That dish was so bad that neither of us could eat it. It was cooked so long that you could even bite all the way through the pieces. And it had a sauce that was totally funky.

All together though - for the prices and the majority of great food AND the amount of locals that were obviously enjoying themselves and had spreads on their table that looked delicious: we would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Super greasy food, taste just ok nothing special.
Fried fish bath in oil, can't even finish it. Fried rice mushy, saggy, wet in oil, salted fish smells like skunk, one word.. TERRIBLE!!
Never come back again..ever!"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical at first when I found out that this place had both Chinese and Vietnamese food because sometimes either one is better than the other or both would be equally mediocre.  We didn't have any issues with the parking here since it was shared in the whole plaza.  We came around 5:10pm on a Wednesday and it wasn't busy at first.  After a few minutes, this place had a lot of people.  I believe it was 5:45pm at that time. 

I wanted to try their Pho Tai ($8.95) so I ordered that.  We also ordered the Mongolian Beef ($13.95), the pork clay pot, the half Fried Crispy Chicken ($13.95) and rice.  It sounded like a lot of food and it was. 

The Pho Tai was surprisingly good since the broth tasted just like places I've been at in California.  The meat was also good, but I noticed red onions were used instead of white onions.  The Mongolian Beef was delicious, the pork clay pot was good and the half Fried Crispy Chicken was not bad.  I was pretty full after finishing the Pho Tai and two plates of rice with the other food. 

This place had good food and would recommend trying this place out with surprisingly good Vietnamese and Chinese food."}
{"text":"Very good food, the whole flounder fish and the hose fish fillet are good.
They open at 11m to 10pm
They all so have the special lunch, too."}
{"text":"I haven't been to China Town here in Vegas in ages but every Friday my friends and I have made a point to get together for \"family\" dinners. A bunch of misfits gathered around a dinner table weekly making an effort to staying connected; it's great!

Capital Seafood was suggested as one of our venue's to host our weekly activity. This fine ethnic establishment fit all of the requests, cost, menu items, and round tables.  (Long rectangular tables or split seating in general makes for awkward dinner conversations where everyone is just not able to get involved.)

The hostess and staff were friendly and polite, attentive and our drinks were never less than half full (woo hoo!).  

For the first hour (even on a Friday night) our party was the only table in the house, hence the stellar attentiveness from the staff.  But the restaurant filled up shortly there after.  Hot tea to start passed along the lazy susan (love those!), won ton soup was delicious and the egg rolls though nothing overly special were tasty.

I can't recall all of the menu items we ordered but everything I tried was fresh, hot and delicious.  Bonus was the lack of sticker shock when the bill arrived! We only had 5 people in our party this week but appetizers, entrees, soups, all came to a reasonable $115! Impressive.

My only gripe is that of most ethnic restaurants (sometimes), the smell. I get it, the place is called \"Capital SEAFOOD\" and such but boy o boy I was ready to jam out of there as hour 3 of family dinner took effect. Fishy, greasy, I don't know but it was making me queasy, ha.

All in all I would grace CS with my presence again and indulge my friends in sharing the experience with me.

Good food, reasonably priced, and friendly staff it's a lot to ask for these days but Capital Seafood did  a great job."}
{"text":"The food is great! Best place to eat Chinese food/pho in all of vegas. Great service and very good prices. I always come here to eat when I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Not too bad Khmer/Chinese/Thai/Viet food here. Good fish, shrimp and seafood dishes here. I believe this is part of the California chain. The service is just like any other Chinese restaurant- just ok. Parking can be a bitch sometimes, but what do you expect; it's right in the heart of Chinatown."}
{"text":"Been coming here on and off for the last 10 years. The place is located at the Chinatown Plaza. Place is huge and has both Chinese and Vietnamese areas. It's clean and airy, the wait staff has been there for years and are very helpful. Good place for large gatherings or parties. Food is good and portions are okay. Prices are reasonable. They have two of my favorite dishes, jellyfish salad and deep fried pork intestine. With so many Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants in the area, this place has survived and on this visit, there were quite a few people. I'll be back again. Try it at compare to other places in the area."}

{"text":"Ate here last night...really wanted to eat at Monta, but decided to give this one a try. Ugh. I think I would have rather gone hungry. It took a long time for someone to seat us, and take our order. It also took a loooong time for the food to come. I was disgusted with all the tables around us that weren't bussed clean. All the dirty plates and leftover food were sitting there. And when the food did come, it was luke warm to cold. Ordered the seafood hot pot, it was full of tofu and a couple shrimp. Ordered the chicken and salted fish fried rice---hardly any salted fish, and full of bad quality chicken. Also ordered ong choy with \"shrimp sauce\". I have no idea how different it was from sauteed with garlic, because that's how it tasted. The portions were rather large, but it doesn't matter. I didn't want to take that home."}
{"text":"Best combination of chinese and Vietnamese dish.
Price is reasonable! good service 
like they meat balls pho, they fish ball pho, their bo bun, fried rice...
Tips ... if you go eat there before 3pm ask for their lunch menu. food and quantity served is the same but price discounted at 20%
if they sit you on the left side it's usually to eat Vietnamese (black menu), no white table clothe :(
on the right will be chinese food (burgundy menu)
you can also pick a fish or crab or lobster from their aquarium. they will cook it for you, price is per the pound.
I usually come here once a month. They are nice and food is great.
if you are not too adventurous try the beef loc lac served white steamed rice, it's some filet mignon with salt and pepper, very good!
Bon appétit"}

{"text":"This place has some pretty awesome lunch specials!

My brother took me here for lunch during the Summer and I've been back about four times since. We always order the Whole Fried Fish ($7.95), Mongolian Beef, Hong-Kong style Chow Mein, and these pork chops (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IO2wXsq9Ow84v5sCoKL6hg/l.jpg). I can't remember the name of them, but they are marinated in a very flavorful sauce. They remind me of the Baked Pork Chops w/ Chef Sauce that I always get at Diamond Chinese. The Whole Fried Fish is probably my favorite dish and I'm not usually a fan of whole fish plates. It is so crisp (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FBe7D8SCuntd9ZNJHPyYiw/l.jpg) and it comes with two different sauces. One is sweet n sour and the other one, I have no idea what it is, but it's my favorite of the two. Whenever it comes out to the table, everyone just rips it apart and devours it. 

The food has always come out to our table very fast and they never forget to refill our water. The only thing that takes a while is when we're ready for the bill and for our change. We always have to flag someone down to bring us the bill, then they take forever to pick it up. That isn't too big of a problem though, since I always eat so much that I don't even want to get up from my chair."}
{"text":"How can yelps said this restaurant is good? Not worth the price and flavor. Not that busy and my whole roasted duck came after I almost done with my other food. The roasted duck are  full of hairs and the way they chopped this duck seems like the chef is trying to kill the  duck after getting an argument with someone. Looking at plate it showed it is not appetizing. Sorry not going to recommend unless you want to waste your money."}
{"text":"Rating for chinese food is 2 stars. Not authentic 

Rating for Vietnamese food here i will give 4 stars. 

However for service if you run into the short hair woman, she will give you the worst attitude to make you either wanna slap her on her mouth or call police to take her away from humanity. I'm never mad at anybody in any restaurant service who's as rude as her. We walked on before 9pm and restaurants close at 10pm. She told us \"you better order or we give you nothing\" 

I asked is there open bottle fee for wine, if she how much, and her answer cant be more rude. 
 Conclusion,  to enjoy the food, find o th er viet restaurant which could be as good quality, or avoid that waitress. I never called anyone Bitcxx, but sorry, she crossed the line and i have to name her one.

Oh... i talked to one of her coworker a young lady who served us afterward, i asked if this woman yell at her or throw attitude same way? Or if she's one of the owner,  the coworker said she's just and employee and always yell at her like that too.  i have put up this review so next year i will rememeber not to come back and let me groups know not to come here."}
{"text":"I've had way better Peking duck. Hot n sour soup was delicious. Wonton soup was ok. French beef and walnut was good. Friendly and good service"}
{"text":"I have no idea if I was just hungry but every single thing I ate was soooo good! Like I am still thinking how good the food was and wish I had some of it right now. There menu was a bit overwhelming. They had a thai menu, Vietnamese menu, and a Chinese menu. If you are indecisive you will have a hard time choosing what to eat.  We had this for a Saturday lunch and we took up 3 tables with the family and kids. Each table ordered there own, with the kids having a table to themselves ordered a variety of stuff. But they definitely enjoyed it cause they didnt have leftovers. Our table went off the family menu which consist of 7 items i believe. We did the $135 family menu which came with a variety of things such as soup, fried rice, fried fish, sizzling beef, clams, really a whole bunch of stuff. And seriously food kept coming! We were like what in the world did we order. Everything was soooo good! The vietnamese sweet and sour soup had the balance of the sweet and sour and not at all salty. Usually i would need to eat it with rice to balance it out, no rice was needed. The fish was super crispy! The skin was just delectable. If you are coming here with family just order off the family menu. Like every single thing was good. I didnt care to much for the clams though, it was kind of salty. Service was great also. Like I dont know how we managed to get great service all weekend in vegas with a party of over 20! Also there bread is to die for!!! So soft and warm! We were so hungry waiting for the rest of our party that we ordered bread. It was the best bread ever! They use the bread for banh mi and I had leftover banh mi for dinner and it still tasted good! I imagine if I ate a fresh banh mi it would be one of the greatest banh mi ever."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a quick and inexpensive lunch - I'm officially adding it to my lunch arsenal.  I went with the green beans w/ extra xo sauce, french style meat and beef chow fun.. also had the thai iced coffee (still jittering from the caffeine) and threw in the salt & pepper tofu as a last minute add, but it was kinda lacking for me.  Definitely could have done without it.  

Fyi - take the stairs... the shoddy elevator had a mysterious liquid lining the walls and the ride was a little scurrrry..."}
{"text":"The best restaurants in china town hands down..I ve been coming here for years, and after I tried all of them here in china town,, I made a conclusion thst this is the best of all..food specially"}
{"text":"I give this place two thumbs up. I have to say it is the best Chinese / Vietnamese restaurant. Pho is fresh and quickly prepared the best fried flounder with sauce I had second to none. Staff are very professional and the restaurant ambiance cannot be more relaxed and family oriented. I was starting doubt the quality of Chinese restaurants here in Las Vegas until we came here to have late dinner. I highly recommend the place for anyone looking for plenty of menu selections or a relaxed and appropriate dine-in for family."}
{"text":"I absolutely ADORE this place. I get the Pho Tai on a regular basis and it's always excellent. The hot and sour fish, described below, is also fantastic. Don't miss the fried egg rolls (from the Vietnamese menu). 

I've tried more dishes here than I can remember, and have always been pleased with what I ordered. The vegetables are always crisp and fresh, the seafood super fresh! This is the only place I'll eat shrimp. Great clams, too!! 

One of the things I like best about this restaurant, though, is the service. Not only is it fast, thorough, and friendly, but unlike some other restaurants in Chinatown here, the waitstaff is always willing to help me find some new menu items to try. They could care less than I'm American--they take pride in their food and enjoy introducing customers to new dishes.

I have a very limited budget, but whenever I eat out, this is my first choice. It is so reasonably priced, that I can get there without sacrificing in other areas of my life."}
{"text":"Went into a wrong restaurant, it wasn't the one I was looking for but just give it a try, my friend and I was happy at the end price is reasonable, big portion and delicious"}
{"text":"We choose this restaurant based on Yelp reviews and it was excellent. The menu has a huge variety of selections Chinese and Vietnamese entrees. We ended up ordered from lunch menu - Mongolian beef, Kung pao chicken and beef chow fun. We also ordered spring rolls and egg rolls. We were also served hot sour soup with our lunch entrees. All were delicious! Egg rolls were fried but with a non trad wrapper very crunchy with pork and mushrooms. Spring rolls were very fresh and tasty. Entrees served as family style which was nice for sharing. Mongolian beef was tender but had a lot of green onions. Chicken was mild so it was good for our taste. I ordered chow fun dry instead of with gravy it was good. At the end of our meal they gave us a sweet   Warm tapioca for dessert. I liked this place bc it was clean, service was good and food was great. Definitely coming back here nx time I visit."}
{"text":"Your same ol chinese/vietnamese restaurant. Nothing special. Same rude service.. But always seem to come back. For cheap convinient eats."}
{"text":"Also my good pho, best soup never change, I try other restaurant but this still my first choice"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch and very disappointed about the quality of the Vietnamese food that they have served .I don't know how theirs Chinese food taste but I don't recommend for any one to try the Vietnamese f here."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Everytime I visit Las Vegas i'll see to it to visit to this chinese restaurant I love this place besides the food are so delicious the employees are very friendly and  they don't care if how much is your tip, not like some of the chinese restaurant on the 1st floor to this building."}
{"text":"We ordered a whole lobster plate. When they bring it out it wasn't even the whole lobster, just half of it. Plus the price was pretty high. It's not worth it!!"}
{"text":"I can sum up my review in 3 phrases: horrible service, unfriendly staff, and mediocre food. Also, having gone to this place twice, I noticed that they seat non-Chinese or non-Vietnamese people in the back tables - clearly some discrimination there. It was more obviousto me the last time we dined here on Christmas day. I don't and would never ever recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great food. Duck was done perfectly. I highly recommend the salty fish fried rice. Omg, to die for! Their porridge is amazing, add a drop of fish sauce and it's delicious. The restaurant is clean. Customer service is great. They are all friendly. A new restaurant that I will visit again."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night and it was completely dead. We were given two menus, one for the Chinese food and one for the Vietnamese food. We ordered a bunch of dishes to eat family style that included clam with black bean sauce, duck, fish filet, seafood hotpot and a soup with burnt rice. I highly recommend not ordering any dish with shrimp, It was very bad quality."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you wanna get away from overpriced strip food for some cheap Chinese food. 
My Favs are
House special fried fish 
French style filet mignon
Beef with Chinese brocolli
Salt pepper fried pork chop
Fried squid."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend last night before going to the Smith Center.  This is one of her favorite places and I really enjoyed my meal.  

First, she ordered way too much food for 2 people.  We got beef chow fun, mixed vegetables with garlic, breaded salt and pepper pork chops, and a tofu hot pot.  Yikes!  The table was full and there were only two of us.

The dishes were all very good.  My favorite was the hot pot.  The tofu is fried first and then put in the broth.  There were a couple of kinds of seafood in the hot pot and some chicken and pork.  There were also some beautiful mushrooms that held the heat from the burner below.  Be on guard to let the mushrooms cool a bit before eating.

A couple of things regarding service.  We were seated and our server was prompt at getting our order.  Since my friend is from Taiwan, she ordered in Chinese and I'm sure that helped our service.  

At the end of the meal, they brought us a complimentary warm mung bean dessert that was very tasty--not too sweet.  Our server also packaged up all the leftovers in take out boxes and I have enough in my refrigerator to feed half the Taiwanese army.  It will taste good as leftovers.

One stereotype I encountered was that one of the servers placed a fork and spoon with extra napkins at my plate but not at my friends.  I wanted to jab him with my chopsticks when he next went by, but I realize he was being helpful."}
{"text":"i don't even know how to describe how horrible this place was. was invited for a private event and left hungry because the food was pretty bad. what kind of chinese restaurant serves \"oden\" or should I say fish cakes? salted cucumbers? WTF? If that appetizer dish is over $12bucks, i'm expecting something more. 

oh and pre fried food? get out!"}
{"text":"We love this place because it has a Chinese and a Vietnamese side, and you can order from either menu. Love the Vietnamese egg rolls - from the Chinese menu, the house fried squid was delicious, as well as the filet steak."}
{"text":"A really good option for when you need to get away from the Strip.  

Located in one of the massive Chinatown strip malls, - parking is a pain.

As one would expect from the name, good fish and shrimp dishes. I believe Capital Seafood is part of a LA based chain.

Great lunch bargains available - our group of five adults got full for less than 80 bucks!"}
{"text":"Hungover and wanted dim sum! It's cheap here and they have the carts that go around so it's legit. If you want chicken feet, they cook those to order...just fyi. Also, if you're planning on splitting the check 2 cards max is their policy. :) I was a little bit disappointed with their pork bao; it lacked a lil flavor but everything else was good."}
{"text":"Well that was a scare. Had to call EMS cuz I was having trouble breathing when I went to the restaurant. I wasn't getting enough oxygen compared to outside, so my body was struggling to balance it out. Overall, food is pretty good for Chinese food.
 -1 star for piss poor ventilation system. It's like they went full blast cool a/c with only a crack in the wall for air to get out.
Would go again if they fixed it."}
{"text":"Boyfriend was craving walnut shrimp for his birthday..and I ordered the chow fun.. Typical Chinese food. But thought the shrimp was slightly better than Sam woo..and seafood harbour.but also a bit pricier .
Overall it wasn't bad and would come.back"}
{"text":"I'm from New York's Chinatown so I have a good idea of decent Vietnamese and Chinese food. Capital Seafood is good. I always get good service from these people. I eat there quite often when I'm in Vegas. The main manager is a Chinese guy from Cambodia. I apologize, Sir, for not remembering your name. The other manager is Mr. Phong Le. They are both very helpful. I usually order a cold Vietnamese noodle dish and bring it back to the hotel. No reason to pay $27 plus tip for the typical Vegas buffett when you can do dinner at Capital for less than $10 plus tip. Take out for $8. I liked the Banh Hoi Bo Nuong, Cha Gio (tiny rice noodle with charbroiled beef and egg roll number 61 on Vietnamese. menu).  Scallop with green vegetable was good (number 60 on Chinese menu) Your personal experiences may vary, but I consistently enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Very delicious food and very accommodating staffs.    My favorite is the noodle soup Phnom Penh style."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good! Our waiter was great he made suggestions on what to go get and what plate was better than another. I didnt want vietnamese food or thai food but was craving something close to cambodian food came here and to my surprise most of the servers spoke cambodian. There is a pretty good variety to pick from. All our plates were delicious! After we finished they gave us free tapioca dessert. Would come back again next time we are in vegas"}
{"text":"This is one of the better Chinese restaurants here at the Las Vegas Chinatown. They were able to accommodate our party of 14  with a huge round table and a Lazy Susan which is rather small compare to the table and caused most people having to stand up in order to get their food.

Nevertheless, the important thing being the taste of the food. The flavors were really great without overloading with spices and heavy sauces. 

One thing about this place is that it can be a bit harder to spot. The restaurant is located inside this plaza with an large decorative Chinese arch written in Chinese meaning \"China Town\". There are many restaurants here and Capital Seafood is located on the second floor with green lettering. 

Location is good and the staff were attentive."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to rate this restaurant since the first day I ate here and now I have that opportunity to do it.  First and foremost, staff is excellent, awesome service food is always tasty and hot.  I have nothing bad to say about this place.  Highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try some Asian cuisine or to anyone who is looking for a great Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"Arrived in Sin City this afternoon and met up with our friends who just flew in from Honolulu. Since we were all tired and hungry, we went up to Capital Seafood in Chinatown. 

 We have been to this restaurant a few times in the past and their food was always pretty good, and we always enjoyed it. However, tonight's dinner was totally disappointing. We ordered four dishes: Beef chow-fun, Pea sprout stir fried with garlic,Gai-lan broccoli with shrimp and Frog legs with ginger and green onion. The Beef chow-fun arrived first. The taste we expected from  this noodle dish was a little odd. It tasted sweet instead of the well balance of soy and oyster sauce seasoning. Then followed by the shrimp and Gai-lan, which tasted bland without seasoning, the Pea sprout was the best of all dishes but still fell short below standard average. Most disappointing was the frog legs, one could tell the protein was previously frozen and didn't thaw out properly and cooked in a rush, the meat tasted rather dry and chewy without any flavor, a disaster for people who would expect the moist, sweet freshness of frog legs.  

Since we were all hungry, we did wipe out most of the dishes except the frog legs. Besides the poor food quality, service through the meal was minimal, no check back after food was delivered and no tea refill either. 
We could see servers chatting on the side and no show of appreciation for business while we were exiting the establishment. Bad food, poor service - I don't think we will return to this restaurant in our future trips again!"}
{"text":"Came here for family lunch last week. Five of us and We ordered the following...
Crab soup
Peking duck
French beef
3.0 lbs Lobster with house sauce $29.95/lb
Sautéed garlic Chinese broccoli
Walnut shrimp
Fried sole fish with sweet n sour sauce
The food was savory and gratifyingly tasteful. No MSG, they say?! They also served in generous portions. We had plenty of leftovers.
Anyways, for the amount I paid, we might have as well went to Bacchanal @ Caesar's Palace Buffet. It would have cost me less."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for the past 3 years.  Each time I am in Vegas, I go to Chinatown and have a little Pho mixed with Chinese.  My last visit was ackward at best.

I was in town during the National Rodeo Finals, 12/8-12/14.  Due to the economy, Vegas has become quite dead.  The same goes for Chinatown.

I don't understand why the restaurant has a Vietnamese side and a Chinese side when you are mostly seated on the Vietnamese side.  We ordered 3 bowls of Pho and they arrived luke warm.  Who wants luke warm Pho anyway?

To top it off, our lettuce came with a big clump of dirt.  We ordered some eggrolls and the lettuce that came with that also had a big clump of dirt.  We brought it to the attention of the Manager (whom we always had good rapport with).  He took the lettuce off our table and came back 10 minutes later with the same lettuce rinsed under the sink.  At this point we were done eating.

We told him to save it and he mumbled something and walked away.  I guess there must be customers coming out the wazoo for this unexpected rude service.  I wonder why the \"A\" is on the window?

To make matters worse, one of the waitresses was cleaning up the table next to us and said in Chinese that the people were cheap and didn't leave a tip.

I give the food here 3 stars.  I give the service here no stars.  I guess TIPS (TO INSURE PROPER SERVICE) have become an expected item these days.  If the service is good, I leave a decent tip.  If not, it's my last visit."}
{"text":"Told us they were too busy to help us after we were seated. Don't know how I'm supposed to eat without ordering..."}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese restaurant located in Chinatown in Las Vegas. Located at the second level of a busy strip mall. They serve family style portions of Chinese and Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for Vegas Chinese food. We ordered 5 dishes to what with 4 people. A Tom Yum soup , beef and scallion, braised duck, tong xing vegetables, and house fried rice. Tom Yum is on the sweet side. Braised duck is good. Meat is flavorful. Beef and scallion is yummy really good. Fried rice is good because it is not too oily. Good service friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Well first time here I this restaurant and we so enjoy our food and the staff was friendly and place is clean and they serve big portions of food and they served Chinese and Vietnamese food , so well Be back soon too try the frog legs and other food I'm excited but other then that wasn't too bad we love it!"}
{"text":"A lot of variety. Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese. Their menus are thick. Average about $5.95 - $7.95 for lunch. They like to hide their lunch menu. So you need to ask for it if they don't give it to you. 

Good portions for lunch specials. Free soup and dessert even for lunch. But again, sometimes you have to ask for it. In my opinion, best deals for the lunch is their pan fried fish. 

Credit card only over $20. But they are pretty flexible about it."}
{"text":"long time customers here. the price is worth it for all the food we eat. we like the house special crab (since were long time customers, we get a little discount) the minced chicken/corn soup is delicious especially on this cold day. we always order two mongolian beefs because it is tasty. the Hong Kong style noodles is very very tasty and a family favorite. the salt pepper shrimp is delicious as always. sometimes we end the night with warm tapioca. the food comes out fast and delicious. although, they are sometimes slow with the drinks."}
{"text":"Got the calamari, busgirl called them chinese french fries, house special fish filets, and chinese broccoli with oyster sauce,  everything was delicious,  been here before and will be here again"}
{"text":"It was very good. We ordered the hu thieu sau and banh xeo. The hu thieu sau was really good and delicious. I highly recommend that. the eggs mixed with the noodles is genius. the banh xeo was okay but A-a-ron said it was and i quote \"the best he's had outside of home\"....so try it to see for yourselves."}
{"text":"Pretty big portions, good for family style. 
Walnut shrimp's is 90% batter and 10% shrimp.
Recommend the fish filet and jelly fish."}
{"text":"This Capital Seafood Restaurant is great and is in great location in China Town!
They have very delicious dishes because of consistency.  Management and staff are quite impressive!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm spoiled but I've had better pho back home in San Francisco. The owner was very nice and willing to help us get taxis. about 18 people about 10 drinks and 5 appetizers = $300. not too bad i guess."}
{"text":"THE spot for authentic Asian food! Ordered French style steak, pho tai, house style fish fillet and egg rolls. Portions were enormous (family style) and price is on the dot. Quality and quantity along with great service. make sure you stop by!!"}
{"text":"I wish it was consistent, first time I went I had the BEST low mein I have EvER had, it was in a delicious brown sauce very traditional Chinese - it was a combo with several meats and shrimp.  This past Saturday it was terrible they didn't use the right type of noodles they were flat and white, the sauce had a weird taste and the same combo had tiny shreds of pork, last time nice size pieces.  

One noodle dish and one scallop,dish cost 37.00 with tip 43-00 for on,y 2 dishes was completely not worth it. So many Chinese restaurants 1-2 price (Emperors Garden for example) what we paid and consistent food quality.

For this price it should have included wor wonton soup and an appetizer."}
{"text":"The owner is very friendly, food is fast, service is good, my favorite dish is string bean with garlic sauce, it is so good!  The lobster is one of my fav as well."}
{"text":"When my dad is in town, I'm bound to find myself at some Chinese restaurant at some point.  Which is what brought me to Capital Seafood over in Chinatown.

Located on the second floor, it's connected to Pho Vietnam, so basically the kitchen is spitting out traditional pho dishes alongside typical Chinese dishes.

They do offer a great deal of lunch specials, but we ended up ordering the entree portions for our party of three.  We went for the Vegetarian Chow Mein, Hong Kong-style ($8.50) and the Beef Chow Fun ($8.50).

They start you off with complimentary sweet and sour soup.  It was pretty salty, not something I would order on my own.

The entree dishes were pretty decent size (check out the pics), but I could have used more veggies in the chow mein order. 

They also gave us complimentary dessert - a hot sweet soup with tapioca balls and jelly.  

Service was just okay.  From where they sat us, they couldn't see us and we couldn't see them.  We had to get out of our seats to ask for water, hot sauce, etc.  That was more of a pain than anything.

Overall, it was an average experience.  I'm not sure how their other foods were like, but we ate it all up!"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas this past weekend and ate here two days in a row. We all know pho is the best cure for a hangover so the first day I ordered that. The broth is very rich in flavor and the bowl was a generous size. The second day I came in a big group and had a family style Chinese dinner. The portions were very big and all the dishes tasted amazing! I recommend getting the honey walnut shrimp! Both days I went we did not have to wait and we were sat immediately. Overall I give this restaurant 5 stars. Great service. Great food. Make sure you check this place out on your next trip to Vegas. You wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to this restaurant for years. We stop by at least once every time we go to Vegas (and we've been going to Vegas since I was little and we go to Vegas a lot). It's a good place to go if you're tired of Strip food and buffets.

My recommendation: Salt and pepper lobster. The only downside is.. they bring the live lobster out for you to inspect, and I always feel guilty and sad about eating it :(

I've had their pho, too. Nothing memorable, but still good when you want authentic soup-y food, especially if you're nursing a hangover."}
{"text":"Delicious food and quick service the biggest drawback is the location.  The parking is horrible and the sidewalks need to be power washed.  It is so gross.  I had guest in from Shanghai and I was really embarrassed that the property is so run down and dirty.  Hopefully someone will take notice and have the mall cleaned up."}
{"text":"Divey and cheap; but with good food and friendly staff.  Really a perfect place for Pho"}
{"text":"Food was good and generous serving. We got the food we ordered within 15 minutes. Staff are nice but we did not get our drinks and utensils until we were halfway done eating (with chopsticks)"}
{"text":"You know that one place that always reminds you of childhood at its best? This would be that place. 

My fondest childhood memories would be family dinners here or the occasional lunch with just my dad. The staff? They definitely help perpetuate the memories, always commenting on how much I've grown or where my brother is. They are the friendliest and always have been very efficient in service. 

The food? My favorites, from childhood to now, have always been the Seafood Chow-fun with gravy, which overflows with various sea creatures in a sauce of deliciousness. I could take out a whole plate if it wasn't for the now-present reality of a slowed metabolism as well as my father competing for some of the yumminess too. Other goodies are the Salt and Pepper Squid, fried to perfection without the unnecessarily frills of sauces. Kung Pao Tofu, Sweet and Sour Vietnamese style fish (fried up then doused in sweet & sour sauce), and the Seafood Hot Pot. All equally delicious and all my favorites.

The best part? Lunch that could feed at least eight of us always ends up being no more than forty bucks or so. The lunch specials are where it's at, and for this, I am immensely grateful. There will always been a soft spot in my heart for Capitol Seafood, it's the place of my childhood."}
{"text":"came here with a large group of friends. This restaurant is perfect for large parties and family style dining. For a Chinese restaurant  this place is decent. The service was great and the server was very attentive. That was probably because we were here on a random night and the place was not that crowded. The portions were fair, each person ordered a main dish to share and we all came out full and satisfied. The food here was standard for chinese, nothing really stood out to me except their french style stir fry beef dish which is very similar to vietnamese shaken beef.  The food came out quickly which was nice. the price was reasonably fair for each dish. Overall food was decent and service was great."}
{"text":"The Mr. was craving whole fish yesterday evening. Over the Christmas holiday we had a rather yummy whole fish with the family in New Jersey, so maybe he was homesick. 

More than likely, he just likes delicious whole fish.

A couple of weeks ago we had asked our favorite waitress at Thai Noodle where she liked to eat. Being a college kid, she said she spent a lot of time hanging at the 24-hour IHOP on Rainbow partially because it is 24-hours and partially because there is a really great waitress there. Besides pancake combos, she said she really enjoyed a hot and sour whole fish at Capital Seafood. I can't tell you if the waitress at IHOP is really that great, but I can give you the run down on the whole fish at Capital.

The Mr. loved it. It is a whole flounder pan fried with hot and sour flavors. It is delivered piping hot with a pile of jalapenos on top. I must warn you that the sour smell is intense if you get a deep whiff, definitely a fermented sauce lurking in the mix, but the flavor is great-- kind of like a sophisticated McNuggets' sweet and sour. (Be careful because if you accidentally order the SWEET and sour I think you will be in for a bigger dose of fermented smell. I overheard the owner tell a table that not too many people can handle the sweet and sour.) I think the sauces are more Vietnamese than Chinese, as the restaurant is half Vietnamese, and on the Chinese menu the dishes also have Vietnamese names. There is also a completely separate Vietnamese menu.

In addition to the fish, we ordered green beans in garlic sauce without meat. (Always important to make that clear at Asian restaurants.) I could imagine someone complaining about the beans being greasy because the whole time I was stuffing them in my mouth I was thinking, \"These can't be good for me.\" Still, my taste buds approved the perfect combination of garlic, spiciness and grease. Plus, the green beans were wilted exactly to my taste. I can't stand when green beans are all waxy and squeaky when you bite into them. Blame my Southern mom for raising me on overcooked vegetables. 

The pot of white rice was super hot. The service was friendly. The food was delivered quickly. All in all it was a positive experience, but our next whole fish adventure will probably be testing out the frying service at the fish counter of Ranch 99. (That place has to be the nicest smelling Asian supermarket I have ever entered.)

The Mr. said he would definitely eat the whole fish at Capital again, but when it comes to food, we seem to always be searching for the next better thing. I am sticking to three stars because eating two dishes does not really qualify me to bestow more."}
{"text":"If you're looking for quick and fast authentic Cambodian/ Chinese food this is the place for you! 
It's a great mix of Cambodian and Chinese food all in one.

-frog legs were pretty bomb' 
-battered shrimp was good
-fish soup, don't really care for sweet and sour soup
-sweet pea veggie! Bomb!! 
- kung pao chicken was good 
-fried fish was fried perfectly and was so moist and flakey, pretty darn good
-Clams we're very well cooked 
-mixed seafood soup, was not my thanghhh

-place was very spacious and clean"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic food, great service and some very interesting things on the menu like Jelly fish, shark fin soup, frog legs to name but a few. We, very white folk enjoyed this place a bunch!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend introduced this place to me and my favorite dish here is the house special fish filet. We've gone here normally during lunch together and I will say their service is quick. We've always called ahead of time to let them know we're just coming in for lunch so they always have our dishes ready for us as soon as we get there which is great since we both have an hour lunch! The fish filet is seasoned in this really nice sauce that I absolutely love. There's green onions and jalepenos to top off the dish so it's perfect if you want some spice. It comes with steamed rice, soup and dessert. Now I give it 3 stars because it seems something is different every time I go and for these reasons below. They've never told me I had to have a minimum of $10 in order to use my debit/credit card but I was never told this. The last time I went in for lunch the older gentleman who was my waiter informed me it needed to be a $10 minimum and that there's always been a sign there. He let me know that this time it was ok but for the next time it's the minimum $10. I have no problem with the $10 minimum, but I'm just curious did they change the policy or did they charge me more during my past visits when I've always used my card? The hot and sour soup it comes with seems like it has too much cornstarch or something since the consistency is sort of like gelatin/gloppy soup. The warm desert like soup they give you after your meal is not my favorite, it's just not for me. But decent place for lunch and for a quick lunch!

*TIP: call ahead and let them know you're coming for lunch/dinner and if they can have it ready by the time you get there, give them an ETA. It's easier when you know what you want ahead of time so I advise you look at the menu ahead of time before calling and letting them know you're otw!"}
{"text":"First Customer service was the worst.!!! Server was rude the whole time, she didnt even greet us just asked what we wanted to order.  I ended up finding a roach in the restroom as well, we showed her the pictures and her response was \"it's fine it just came out for you\". I told the manager about the server and all he said was that it was a busy night!!!.. i work in a restaurant too and it doesn't matter if we're busy or not we always give the best customer service we can!!!"}
{"text":"I've had better food here before. Our family is simple. We ordered salt and pepper pork chop, salt and pepper shrimp and Hong Kong style chowmein. We've been here a few times but today the food was blah. No flavor in all three dishes we ordered. Sad. Place was visibly clean and staff was very nice and friendly. They kept playing with my 19 mo old. Nice to know they are kid friendly."}
{"text":"Lunch specials all the way. I forget when the lunch hour finishes, but I have gotten here around three and was still able to order off the specials menu. This is always the go to spot when I want to treat my parents to a meal. It is only becoming more difficult to convince them to go out with the economy, but with the mere mention of Capital they are getting ready. It has a lot to do with the prices, quality, and service.

The prices are cheap for the amount that you get. I am not a fan of getting a large plate of substandard and Capital Seafood does not make me feel like I am lowering my expectations.

The whole fried fish in sweet and sour sauce ($7.95) comes out so crisp that you can eat the bones around the edge. An order of kung pao tofu ($5.95) comes out looking like the Great Pyramids topped with whole chilies, peanuts, and chunks of scallions. My sister's favorite seafood chow fun in gravy ($7.95) is always hot and filled with gai lan and a variety of shrimp, fish cakes, imitation crab (only bummer), squid, and fish fillets. The Peking pork chops (6.95) are massive and plenty. I wish they were more crisp. The fried battering gets soft quicker than the ones at other restaurants. The bonus of being connected to the Vietnamese restaurant is that I can order a che ba mau. They make my favorite version in Vegas. I recently had a bad experience with this dessert at a different place, but Capital restored my faith. In the end, my mom and I packed up the leftovers and had enough food for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Food is very mediocre, nothing to drive home about. The vegetables were lousy, clay pot was lousy, steamed fish was decent, shrimp was dull, and service was typical of a Chinese restaurant and the guy who took our order didn't speak Chinese which is always welcoming at a Chinese restaurant right? 

After 8 dishes, the bill came out to $160 and we had about 6 people and asked if they included gratuity and they lied and said no so we paid 15% tip on top of gratuity. My mom was curious about how it came out so expensive so we took a menu and did the math and turns out they did add gratuity so that's great as well. 

Steer clear friends. 

My family told me not to be surprised since Chinese restaurants are notorious for cheating their customers. Always check your bill before paying!"}
{"text":"I usually go to Sam Woo but decided to go upstairs to Capital. Staff was very friendly and food was good. Beef Chow Fung came in a huge portion. Soup unfortunately comes in a huge bowl for two people with the cheapest one being $7.95. I gave it three stars because I thought it could be more accommodating to the solo diner. Would I go again? Probably ..... But only if it's someone else's idea."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of Capital Seafood Restaurant. I came here with my family on a Thursday afternoon. It was around 4:30 so the place was empty. We were seated right away and given a few minutes to look over the menu. They not only serve Chinese food, but they also serve Vietnamese food from the place next door. I'm assuming it's the same owner. The Vietnamese for consists of your typical spring rolls, egg rolls, pho and traditional rice dishes. We decided to just stick with the Chinese food since that's what we were craving. 

// FOOD // 
French style beef: I always love this dish. It has such great flavor and it's so tender. They make this dish extremely well here! It comes out on a bed of raw onions and a few slices of tomato. 4.5/5

Fried tofu: Can't go wrong with something that's fried. They serve it here with a light soy sauce and a sweet and sour sauce. It comes out nice and crispy and I believe it came with 8 pieces. 4/5

Shrimp in lobster sauce: This was probably the most disappointing dish out of them all. It didn't have any flavor and still lacked flavor even when we added soy sauce and white pepper to it. 2/5

Black mushroom with bok choy: Your typical vegetable dish. The mushrooms were light and had a great texture to them. The bok choy was cooked perfectly as well. 3.5/5

Beef chow fun: Your typical beef chow fun. Can't go wrong with a noodle dish. 4/5

Overall, I was pretty impressed with Capital Seafood and will definitely be back. I wouldn't order a couple of the dishes again, but that just means I get to try other dishes the next time I come. I highly recommend this place if you're craving Chinese food in the area. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food Is Okay. Service is not good. I ordered one item and they came out with 2 thinking I ordered 2. They do not accept credit card for purchases under $10 which is ridiculous. I would probably not come back to this restaurant without a group. But food is edible!"}
{"text":"I love Capital Seafood in Southern California, but this one is booty!

I am not your regular Sweet & Sour Pork & Honey Walnut Shrimp whiteboy, so please know that I KNEW what I was in for as my usual order includes House Special Fried Squid, Salt & Pepper Pork Chop, French Style Beefsteak, Eggplant & Shredded Pork, Baby Bok Choy in Garlic Sauce, Pan-Fried Crispy Noodle with Seafood Gravy, etc...

The LV Capital Seafood  is BIZZARE.  You walk in and they as you \"You want Chinese or Vietnamese food?\"   This restaurant is split in half and is actually a Pho restaurant on the left and Chinese food on the right.  I'm so familiar with Capital Seafood in Southern California that I of course chose Chinese and ordered without ever looking at the menu.  My homesick stomach was craving the house special squid so I ordered the usual feast along with a few Tsingtaos...Although the menu was the same, the quality of the food and the service weren't.  Not only was the squid tough, but most of the food arrived to the table cold (luke warm at best)...Even the tapioca dessert was blah...

Bu Hau..."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant yesterday for lunch about 11:30am. Initially it wasn't busy. By the time I finished my meal, they were jumping. I don't know my servers name, however she (a younger female) was knowledgeable and pleasant. My meal which consisted of pho, and crispy spring rolls, which is my favorite. There is usually a gentleman at the register, but I didn't see him today. I wanted to thank him for his suggestiions of my take out lunch the last time I was in. It was a hit!  OK that's it for the pleasantries. There was a little short grumpy women, who has never waited on me before. My bill was $17 and I left a $3 tip on the table. When I stopped at the cashier to pay my bill, the little short grumpy women asked me if I had cash. I said \"sorry, I don't have anymore cash on me\" The little short grumpy women, then rang everything and applied the balance to my debit card. I still had to sign my receipt. When I handed it back to her, she turned the receipt toward me and asked \"No tip!\"? I looked at her a little confused at first, but replied \"I left it on the table\". Now my blood pressure is rising, and I wanted to say a few things to her, for insulting me. I decided Yelp would be a better way to go. She also reprimanded a young man (I believe he's new) in their language about the number of place settings on the table. I don't know his name either, but he wore black framed glasses and worked the room with the younger female server. You could tell by the expression on his face, that he was a little embarrassed, since she yeld across the room. 

Well the little short grumpy older woman ruined my lunch. I thought about her condescending remark to me all the way home. Hopefully she is not the owner, because she should be a bus person only. This same little short grumpy older women borrowed the hot sauce from my table. She didn't ask, but she did say hello as a distraction while she had to reach pass  me to get it.When the little short grumpy older women retuned the hot sauce it literally was a drive-by. It startled me to see the hot sauce sliding across my table like a baseball player sliding into home plate. She never broke her stride, and never looked back.

I've been eating lunch/early dinner here since 2004, and as much as I really love the food, I haven't decided if I will ever go back. I don't eat Pho anywhere but here. 

So to all the other staff, I apologize to you, that this \"little short grumpy woman\" has adjusted your rating with her unprofessional behavior!"}
{"text":"We celebrated my husband's and son's birthdays with a family dinner. Excellent food and service as always!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with the special banquet menu. Very disappointing. Food was not good. The crispy chicken was over done so it was dry and salty. The fish was small. And most disappointingly was the food wasn't cheap."}
{"text":"There are hundreds of Chinese restaurants in Vegas, so the only reason we decided to try this one is because of their House Special Lobster. Wanted to check out how it compares to the same dish made famous in the Little Saigon region of Westminister, CA.

First of all, the place is LOUD, with big groups of boisterous business types and crying babies. Service is a tad slow too. 

The lobster was good but not equal to the California version. This one has a less buttery flavor, is a bit spicier and with a lot of pepper. We ordered a Thai style seafood soup that could have used more flavor as they seem to skimp on the ginger, galangal and lemongrass.

The mung bean dessert was great. It's not a universal favorite but I'm always happy to eat 2 or 3 bowls of it when others decide to skip it.

Overall, decent place but we will still need to make the 4 hour treck to Little Saigon for the quintessential House Special Lobster."}
{"text":"2 menus: 1 Chinese food and 1 Vietnamese food.  2 cooks.  Large menus of tasty dishes.  In the heart of Chinatown.  I like the pho, hot pots, soups, sizzling plates and rice dishes.  Family style servings and good service.  Spacious place w/lots of other Asian restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Never ever coming back..
  The service was horrible. They charged 15% tip for serivce and the servers do nothing. They gave us the wrong veggies to add to our broth and when I asked for a different plate they were very ignorant. Afterwards, I asked for water for our table and the server came out with half full glasses of water! And when we looked over at the other table, they had full glasses of water!! They should treat all customers fairly. EXTREMELY AWFUL SERVICE. 15% for tip?! If I could give this place ZERO STARS; I would. Not going to recommend to anyone and DEFINITY NEVER coming back to dine here again."}
{"text":"We were looking for a decent chinese seafood restaurant and decided on this place.  The food is good, we were wary at first because it's a combined Vietnamese and Chinese restaurant.  Not that that's bad, but sometimes restaurants that try to do too much can suffer from an identity crisis.  At any rate, we saw that it had only 3 stars on Yelp but mostly due to service so we thought we'd give a try.

Upon entering we were immediately seated and ordered about 4 dishes for 3 of us.  We had their house special crab, french beef cubes, kung pao shrimp, and green bean dish.  It was very good, and we were full. No complaints, tasted like chinese food should. Service was really good too, so maybe it only suffers when it's really busy.  The waitress always came by and filled our drinks.  The crab and beef were the big winners, the crab was fresh but messy.  They have a lunch special menu, which I'd like to try next time I come out to Vegas."}
{"text":"It seems like every time we come to china town in Vegas, we stop by here to eat. This place is great for a little bit of every kind of Asian food you can imagine.

The food is really good but beware, the service isn't great. We had to physically flag a server down to take our order and once the food came out, they didn't really ever come back.

Be ready to spend a good amount of money here. My sister and I ordered soup, two dishes, and drinks which totaled $60! We didn't even get any alcohol or market seafood dishes!

The food is good but maybe next time I will stick with their pho."}
{"text":"Ohhh the French beef was so good! Melt in your mouth good. The portion here was huge and the price is decent. Initially I thought the French beef was a little on the pricey side for this place but once I had it, I can see why it's more expensive. The service here is mediocre."}
{"text":"Good job to the cooks for creating a good tasting soup. Is it true about the place they take your order they bring your food and then they leave you alone so when you run out of a drink you're going to have to walk over to the waterspout and refill your own drink. She literally never came back until it was time to collect the bill. I was half tempted to leave a verbal tip but I left the customary amount when I Departed the cashier was in a hurry to get me out of there. The food was good but the service was horrible"}
{"text":"Completely disappointed with our lunch.

Ordered the seafood platter, roasted duck and a plate of veggies to share for a party of five.

Seafood platter barely had any seafood - shrimp I could count on one hand and had imitation crab meat and fish cakes. Not what I was expecting from a seafood platter. Also the whole dish was loaded with white cabbage. 

The duck itself looked like it was mauled and the presentation was bad. Skin also was not crispy and not cleaned properly - had hairs still on the skin. Inedible and some parts were tough. I had roasted duck before in Philly and other parts of California and this doesn't compare.

The reason why I am giving this place a one star review has to be the service. The service is the icing on the cake: tea pot was empty and never refilled until the end of our meal when they started dessert. Also, the duck came extremely late - to the point of where we finished all of the other plates and the roasted duck came out. When we questioned why it was late, we were given a \"Oh, other places cook at different times we take longer\". Since we were quite full and sick of waiting at this point we wanted half a duck. Their response? Put the duck on the table and walk away. Great service. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"The food here is great! Whether it's the pho, Vietnamese food, Chinese food, or even Cambodian style food, it's all amazing! I'd recommend ordering family style for big groups. Their $55.00 dinner with catfish soup, salt and pepper shrimp and basil w/ clams dish was worth every penny! Much better deal than places on the strip when you want some good food in vegas!"}
{"text":"I must say.. this is the worst chinese restaurant in Vegas. 
This is my second time here. 2 dining experience were exactly identical. We ordered few items, including whole fish- fried with sweet n sour sauce, calamari, fan fried chowmein, seafood hotpot, etc. The only thing we enjoyed was the Vietnamese eggrolls."}
{"text":"Generous portion sizes, and a very friendly staff. Good selection of both Chinese and Vietnamese cuisines. Recommend the House special squid, and the fried tofu!"}
