{"text":"I'll keep it sweet n simple. This place is very basic n bland. They need their on seasoning to make the food stand out more. Customer service was good tho. Place needs work for sure but I can tell improvements are around the corner. I'll try again n a couple months maybe"}
{"text":"Second time here and still horrible service.  Food is good.  There is a lot of it but don't go if you are in a hurry.  The hostess came back three times before she seated us.  Then we waited 10 minutes before we decided to leave."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!! Our server Kirsten was the best.... She recommended the Thai chicken nachos and the spicy cucumber margarita. Excellent combination. Thanks Kirsten I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here 3 times with large groups from work. The food was good, the staff was really attentive."}
{"text":"Great food and and drinks! Ask for Amanda...one of the BEST servers I've ever encountered in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Staff is very nice. Food is waaaay over priced. My wife got wings and they may have been the worst chicken wings I've ever tasted at a restaurant. Frozen Tyson wings taste the same. We got the filet mignon nachos and I'd love to see the \"filet mignon\" they used. Food gets 1 star. Staff gets five. Edited this review. Staff is nice but it's taking forever to get the check. Legitimately 15-20 mins after we were done eating."}
{"text":"Went with my daughter tried few things from happy hour including the margarita. . Street tacos were amazing!! I'll come back just for those alone."}
{"text":"We had a GREAT birthday  dinner for my sister.  Started with  the grilled  chicken  wings which were so good on their own-just the right amount of spice not too hot. Everyone  loved them!  Then, came our nachos.. My husband and I had spicy Thai chicken(again,  not overly  spicy IMO)  and the pulled pork nachos. We shared,  and  Both  really  hit  the spot. Finished  the evening with fried ice cream nachos.. Not sure I can put those into words.  Our server, I believe  his  name was Greg,  also on top of his game! You won't  be disappointed.  Definitely  going back  soon!"}
{"text":"Yummy nachos!! Perfect for that late night snack just for a simple place to hang out."}
{"text":"Really good place if you want the Caucasian Mexican food experience. The most authentic item we tried was the 6 dollar street corn. Very good!  The shredded corn chips used as a garnish on the chicken tortilla soup were stale. Besides that error, it was a good soup for those Gringos who don't like too much chili heat in their soup. The dip trio was pretty good. 2 good tasting items and the most bland salsa ever. Mennonites would think this stuff is underwhelming. The chicken on my nachos lacked the pop I thought I was going to get by looking at it. Good rich chili color but did not perform as expected. I was impressed with the naked wings. Flavor and visually appetising, a good start.   If you are looking for authentic Mexican food with an edge keep driving east. If you want a trendy place to fill up on chips, cheeze, toppings, and good Americanized versions of Mexican classics while Staff and management make an effort which is nice. This place is good enough."}
{"text":"Good: food Bad: service. I couldn't be more upset. Wait staff standing around while patrons pour their own drinks. Two bartenders but no one at the bar. One waiter for 7 (correction 12) tables. I almost feel like this was a sociological experiment that was designed to test the limits of a person's rational response to incompetence. I hope whoever designed this experiment gets their phd sooner than later."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy was a really nice discovery. At first we though it might be like a chain. The staff was very friendly and the service was excellent. They have a large selection to chose from. And the margarita was excellent too."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but the food isn't very good any more ...it used to be bomb..and the bartender Scarlett. Was horrible ..we had to ask her 5 times. FOR EVERYTHING..and we were the only ones at the. bar ...Boo"}
{"text":"Omg this place is amazing ! Everyone here is awesome !!! I had the scorpion shot and it was mad wicked but super amazing !!!! And their food is absolute delish!!!"}
{"text":"The service was the worst that we have experienced. The place was not that busy. I don't get it. I wouldn't recommend this pmace."}
{"text":"I've been here twice - once was when I turned 21 and it was to get my first alcoholic beverage legally! The cocktails are really big so I was very happy with my purchase. Not only that, the nacho plate sizes are huge and can feed up to 4 people or 2 really hungry people.   The location is very convenient if you are on Fremont Street (The Old Strip) partying with friends, going to First Friday, or touring. It's very small so if you go when its busy, you might have to wait awhile but for the most part, the food was very worth its price (cheap for large portion nachos and drinks)."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy was close to our hotel so we tried it upon arriving in town. The food and margaritas were very delicious. We decided to eat here again before we left town and look forward to returning when out west again. Staff is friendly, knowledgeable and the queso is awesome! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is super awesome when coming to vegas, the food is super tasty plus the bar tenders are just amazing. We started by sitting in the bar section and with in seconds Scartlett the bartender came to take our drink orders, I had my typical blue moon and my wife had a white peach margarita that Scarlett recommended, next she brought us chips and salsa and took our food order, I had the naked grilled wings buffalo flavor and my wife ordered the fillet Mignon nachos with in minutes our food was brought to us super hot and fresh as I took my first bite of the wing it just took me out of this world from all that flavor, next my wife tasted her nachos and her first word that came out of her mouth was OMG, the meat as my wife describes it was tender juicy and super delicious, drinks were absolutely amazing will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"First, Jovanny was our waiter and had excellent customer service which made us enjoy the atmosphere even more. We got the corn on the cob appetizer, chicken enchiladas, filet mignon nachos, and the house margaritas. The food and drinks were delicious and portions were generous! Definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"I've tried.  I hate not positively giving love to a business but I have tried Nacho Daddy at least 5 times for various reasons.  I have attended shows at the Henderson location.  I have had a business meeting there.  I've simply gone there on Date night.  I just cannot say I have ever liked any of the food that I have tried.  I've everything from the Nachos to the enchiladas and it just wasn't for me.  It's a hair pricier.  Not terribly, but a hair.  Maybe I just think that because I would have rather not spent the money on something I didn't like.    But I did try.  The reason it gets at least another star is because the staff has always been good to me, the atmosphere, the look of the place, and even just the cleanliness of the restaurants, are important to me.  I won't be rushing back at all, but with all the advertising and billboards they have, they must be doing something right.  I'm just not a fan."}
{"text":"Great tasting nachos. & the margaritas are really good! Definitely coming back! Great service. Were able to accommodate our party of 9."}
{"text":"Great food but some confusion with my order and final tab. If not for these issues would have rated 5 stars. The manager Angie was the absolute best and she definitely deserves 10 stars. THANK YOU ANGIE for saving our experience."}
{"text":"Pros: Waiters are nice and friendly, relaxed environment. Nice beer selection and great to watch a game or come with friends.  Con: I think the food is horrible. Beef tacos seemed like what I would get at del taco. Nachos are supposed to be what they are known for but we paid almost $20 for nachos that just seemed very basic and lacking of excitement.   Been here twice and felt the same way both times. Would take a lot for me to come back here as I am not a sports fan."}
{"text":"Loved this place and would definitely go back again! The hostess was very nice and welcoming. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was cool. We were there a little after lunchtime, so we didn't have to want to be seated. If my stomach was as larger as my eyes I would have order more food. My margarita was pretty darn good too. On my next trip to Vegas Nacho Daddy will be on the must do list"}
{"text":"We came by for my cousins bachelor week. Stopped by and the food was phenomenal. Big portions at a great price. MJ, our server, was awesome. By far she provided some of the best service we've had this week."}
{"text":"This was our first meal out during our recent trip to LV.  Easy walk from our hotel, seated right away.  2 in our party, had GREAT service from Arienna! She let us know about a free margarita if we checked in on Yelp, so we did! She gave us great food suggestions, with no rush! Decisions were tough because it all sounded so good.  We shared the kale salad and fish tacos- delicious!  Fresh! Creative! fast! The food was beautiful and tasted great.  One down side- I wanted to eat and talk, not feel like I'm at the club.  I know its Vegas, but if I wanted to go to the club, I'd go there.  Highly recommend.  We got carry out later in the week too, yum!"}
{"text":"So. Good!! My wife and I hadn't eaten much the whole day and were looking for something hearty but not crazy expensive. Started with the triple play of queso, guacamole and salsa. Goodness gracious that queso is bonkers. I could bathe in that cheesy deliciousness. I got the supreme tostada nachos and my wife got the taco and enchilada combo. The nachos were really good - lots of toppings and fresh ingredients. My wife's plate was excellent as well - tender, flavorful meats and the taco shell was one of the best I've ever had - crispy and chewy st the same time. I'd come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Great food, good brews cant wait to come back and do it all over again, kitchen staff killed it"}
{"text":"Both visits where around late evening. Had the chicken enchiladas and pork tamales.  Enchilada in green sauce were nothing special.  Spanish rice and refried beans where mediocre.  Pork tamales with plenty of meat  where over seasoned and abit salty.  One of the servers was attentive. On second visit had a famous margarita.  The large glass with plenty of ice was way two sweet and again nothing special. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Excellent Pomegranate Margarita and Supreme Nachos are ah-mazing!!  The Guacamole is so fresh and Sierra is an awesome bartender!  Very sociable and fun!!"}
{"text":"Food was great but a bit disappointed in the service. Three out of four drinks came out before the meal, but the fourth hadn't come by the time our meal came--and neither had the chips and salsa we ordered. We inquired, and the chips came out, but the last drink didn't. It took another reminder, after we were almost finished with our meal, to finally get the last drink.  Their nachos are very good, and so are the margaritas. I preferred the Daddy's margarita, which was more balanced, over the house margarita, which was too sweet."}
{"text":"I always got a kick out of the Nacho Daddy name--I have a 5th grade sense of humor.    So when they opened a location in my neighborhood near Summerlin, I was super excited to try them out!  As the name suggests, they specialize in nachos.  TOFU NACHOS EXIST, y'all!  Try them if you're a veggie.    Also, the tortilla soup is a MUST.  I am Mexican so I know what I'm talking about.  If you are over the age of 30, you will get a kick out of the music videos that they show when there's not a game on (or they still show them but on silent so patrons can watch football, basketball etc..)  These are classic, hilarious and often mind boggling music videos from the 80's.  Remember when Eddie Murphy was singing about his party girl?    The staff is very accommodating.  My friends and I sit at the bar which is usually not over-crowded.  The bartenders are attentive, friendly and knowledgable about mixed concoctions and tequila.  Yes, they offer a shot with a scorpion in it.  Be brave!    On Weds night, they hold trivia night.  The questions are tough.  My friends and I are Public Ivy grads and we usually come in close to last lol.  Put your team together and if you win, I think the prize is a 50$ gift card (not sure since we've never won lol.)  It's a lot of fun and a great way to meet people!  Not sure why this place isn't busier with the creative food, great service, entertainment and reasonable prices.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Got coupons in the mail so I thought we'd give it a try. READ THE FINE PRINT. The waitress Vic told us \"only one coupon per table\" when she saw them. It doesn't say that anywhere on them, however:-(  First of all, none of the 4 of us has EVER been to ANY Mexican restaurant that doesn't serve complimentary chips and salsa - not this place! But you can order that off the menu:-( we were told. 4 of us ordered, 3 meals were right, 1 not. Flagged down a waiter to explain the problem and he reordered the meal for us. Other 3 ppl were more than 1/2 way done with their food when the last one arrived. We also ordered White Peach Margaritas thinking we could use the 'buy one/get one' coupon and never realizing it meant ONE coupon ONLY for food or drinks. Got $12 margaritas that were NOT fresh, but a mix. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! They were awful. So, we ended up using one coupon and our nachos for 4 of us plus 2 margaritas @12 each and our bill came to $84. ONE AND DONE. NEVER EVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere.Our server Judy gave great recommendations and service. Looking forward to returning there soon. Thanks"}
{"text":"This was an unexpected surprise. Filet Mignon nachos were outstanding fresh and tasty. Yelp app coupon got us a free margarita with our meal. Service fast and friendly. Meal was exactly what we wanted for lunch."}
{"text":"Took some time for someone to get to our table.  I think there was some confusion with the host getting us a server.  AJ walked by and realized we hadn't been helped and quickly stepped in and took over our table (note this wasn't in his section)  He did a great job taking care of us and turned our first experience at nacho daddy around.  The food came out and was excellent, the tostada nacho platter was bomb!  We will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"First time here. Used to go to the Henderson location. Love the energy in here. Plenty of TVs for the games. Awesome patio. And Kimmi pours some awesome drinks. Will definitely be back. Keep my Tito's water full!!! Thanks Nacho daddy!!"}
{"text":"Wow!! I had an amazing experience at Nacho Daddy!  Food was great, nachos of course, and their top shelf margarita was perfect.  Mikey, our waiter, was very attentive and checked in with us regularly.  My friend and I hadn't seen each other since high school and we spent 5 hours catching up.  It was the perfect atmosphere for us to renew our friendship.  They also had TVs that wrapped around the bar and we enjoyed watching music videos as well.  I'm looking forward to making this a spot I meet up with friends!"}
{"text":"Bacon enchiladas and XX for breakfast!!!server (AJ) was attentive and gave us our privacy"}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome food. Even with all of the choices here in Vegas we still contemplated going back a second time during our trip.  Scorpion shots?! Not for me--but very cool place to hang out"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.... The food is great. Fresh ingredients which makes the difference but what tops the cake is the service. My waitress Arieanna was hands down the best server I have ever had. Genuinely cared about us and making sure we were happy. Definitely be back. Keep it up Nacho Daddy!!"}
{"text":"Keep it simple ... and nacho daddy has done that with nachos and they're incredible. The tostada supreme nachos are your typical Mexican mix up and they do not disappoint. Also get a margarita for checking in on yelp. Will be a Stop for me on every Vegas trip from here on out"}
{"text":"Was just good. Margaritas were huge, but a little too sweet for my taste.  I even tried the jalapeno margarita it was just OK.  The nachos were good, but a little salty.  For a place that has Nachos in it's name that isn't great.  Will say that my waiter was very good.  Super nice and explained a couple of things to me.  I watched some football there and was very good place for that."}
{"text":"Great margarita great food and great server Thanks Gabby!!!!!  Oh BTW If you are vegan there are plenty vegan options with loads of vegan cheese"}
{"text":"I looked into your foods and made a phone call about the vegan chick'n and it's a vegan meat alternative. I apologize or the trouble and hopfully I'm the only customer that had the mistrust that I had because it felt and tasted like meat. Nacho Daddy is the best and I appreciate that you have that amazing Vegan Menu!"}
{"text":"Super great nachos! Would recommend coming here if you are hungry and want some great food. Ask for Gabby! She's the best!!!"}
{"text":"We checked in on YELP & got 3 FREE Margaritas!  It's a mix, but STRONG & good!  We're Texas Girls & Nacho Daddy rivals Texas Mexican Food.  We loved the queso & guac!  The food was fantastic!  If you're in Vegas & need a cheap meal....go here!  Not crazy loud, but yummy & filling.  3 of us split an app & a Supreme Nacho skillet.  YUM"}
{"text":"We tried to go here for a late lunch on a Sunday.  Despite the place being 3/4 empty, we were told the wait was 15 minutes.  So we waited at the bar and got some drinks. 20 minutes later the hostess called my phone from a whole 10 feet away to tell us our table was ready.  Once we were seated at our table, we waited 20 minutes for a server to show up.  No one ever did, although someone had the time to come by and pick up our menus, otherwise ignoring us. I finally went up to the hostess stand to ask them to send us a server. Except the hostess was outside talking to someone, so I had to ask a busser. The hostess finally came by and said she'd send a server over. We waited another 15 minutes and no one showed up. We finally decided to move back to the bar since we knew at least the bartender was working and could put in an order. Apparently prep work was more important than paying customers, because one of our party overheard her tell the barback she was too busy to take our order.  One hour of waiting later, we walked out.  We specifically came here because of the nachos and because it was local. So much for supporting a local business."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was amazing! The enchilada nachos were absolutely amazing. Judy was super great and super helpful with recommendations!"}
{"text":"I the food was amazing and my my favorite part was the servers one being Gabby and the second Sergio. I don't think my experience would have been as good with out the severer. If you come here late night ask for Gabby she won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I have come here in the past and wasn't disappointed, but my recent experience made this restaurant lose my business. I came in the other evening and I was ignored for over 20 minutes while the short Asian bartender talked to other customers. She also used profane language in front of other customers very loudly. I left without being served. Would not recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"The supreme nachos tostada was awesome. Our server AJ was on point and very attentive to our needs before we asked for anything. We'd come back again and ask for AJ."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner with friends and was served by Jonathan. All the hostess were sweet and nice and everything was good up until my friends' orders came out so I waited for my order which never came. Our server was busy waiting a large group that came in after us, which was understandable but time kept going and the table needed refills and my friends' were basically done eating their huge plates of food before we were able to flag down our server about what happened to my order. A huge platter of tacos went to that table he was helping. He said he'll let us know and then goes over to the big party. Basically takes care of that big party the whole time. He walks by and says it'll be out soon. It's been well over 40 minutes for two tacos with rice and beans by that time. My friends are stuffed and done with their food and I had to go, it's close to an hour now. So I flagged the waiter down and just politely asked if we could just cancel my order. He tells me it's literally done but we've been sitting there and everyone in my party is sitting there done while he's been serving that one large party. I  needed to leave so I just told him it's ok I'd rather not take it because I wouldn't be able to eat it or keep it on me. I'm not one to take home food either if I didn't buy food for the whole family. He comes back and inquires about why I don't wanna take it home so I tell him I have things to do and I don't wanna eat all of this in front of my family and he replies with \"so you don't eat in front of your family?\" Which was pretty rude so I told him well I'm not gonna sit there and have them watch me eat and not have bought food for everyone? I've waited so long for this food and literally everyone was finished and we had to move on. The place was not even busy. Plus I don't understand why a small order was suddenly done when I wanted to cancel it and he's being rude to me about it. Oddly enough after getting us our check he apologizes and says it's all his fault. But it's insincere because just a minute ago he didn't understand how I wouldn't want to take the food with me when there could be a number of reasons why and it's no ones business. I would've been fine if he just canceled it but having to explain myself and having his comments just really made a bad experience."}
{"text":"Been here twice before. Great staff and cool vibes. They play music and music videos on large screen in restaurant."}
{"text":"Cool spot.. you can tell it wasn't everyday they came across parents with children so close to the strip but from the host to our waitress .. better yet every staff member we came in contact with was super nice. They allowed up to flow up our stroller up front right under the camera and reminded to us to take our valuables out. They brought up a booster seat but we both decided a high chair was better.. they seated us at the end which was a great choice for our crazy toddler. Lots to choose from , great portion sizes .. 2 people could share 1 plate of nachos because they pile it high. Our waitress was super laid back she was so awesome in making sure we had everything we needed .. even the food runner accommodated us by getting us an extra side of chicken from the kitchen at it wasn't even his table. Great experience will definitely come back here Our waitress even ran down the block to catch us on the strip to give back my sons sippy cup.  I totally don't remember her name but girl you rock!!"}
{"text":"This place had great service and my server Magahan was great and just what I wanted a few days after returning from serving my country. Thank you for making this a great meal"}
{"text":"When I'm vegas make sure you come to Nacho Daddy!!  Jovany was amazing! Make sure to come visit him!! :) Great Margaritas and food!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late afternoon snack while visiting Las Vegas and were pleased to find you received a sizable portion of nachos to share.  We tried the BBQ Chicken nachos and ordered 6 naked BBQ wings, which were also great! The wings had a spicy dry rub and came with the BBQ sauce on the side.  The nachos were piled high with pulled chicken, although they had a bit too much BBQ sauce for my opinion and could have used a bit more salsa and cilantro.  Happy hour was also starting and we couldn't pass up $4 draft Mexican beer.  Just off the main Las Vegas Strip with outdoor seating in the Miracle Mile shops its a nice place to grab a quick eat!"}
{"text":"To start, what Mexican restaurant charges for the first round of chips and salsa?  And what salsa is so garlicky that it will be coming out of my pores for the next few days?  I had the chicken enchilada and it was very dry along with very dry  beans and very dry rice - at least it was consistent.  Nothing redeeming about the food. Should have gone one more block to Viva Mercado."}
{"text":"Just got back from nacho daddy another good taco combo I userly go down town but tried this one very good.cristine the hostess took very good care of me.well done nacho daddy."}
{"text":"Basic Tex-Mex type menu. Wasn't really blown away by anything.  The nachos were pretty lacking. So much for the \"never a dry chip\", we had a bunch of them.  If you've been to one American Tex-Mex eatery, you've pretty much have been to them all.  At least the manager was honest about their mediocre tamales.  I give him credit for being truthful about it and not trying to sell me on them."}
{"text":"First time here yesterday. I recommend to get the BBQ chicken nachos! They were honestly the best nachos I've ever had. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Ryan and Kimberly took really good care of us!!!! Ryan was very friendly, handsome and accommodating!!!! He had a lot of patience with us and treated us very nice. I highly recommend Nacho Daddy and the Scorpion Shots!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in on a quiet sunday morning. Kimmi took excellent care of me. Loved the delicous free margarita and grilled naked wings. Will be returning and bringing all my friends."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in late night on Thursday, drawn in by the significant vegan options on the menu. Rolando was our server/bartender.   Rolando was awesome, made us feel welcome, and was one of the best servers we have ever had, anywhere.  The food was great too!  Rolando and the food made such a good impression, we came back for lunch and late dinner on Friday. Yes, we ate here 3 times in less than 24 hours.   Food and service were great.   Highly recommended.   Back in Vegas for the weekend, and stopped in 2 more times. Definitely didn't disappoint. Food and atmosphere are wonderful.   Arienna was my server today, and she was great as well!"}
{"text":"Had the filet mignon nachos, holy smokes. Absolutely delicious and was plenty of food for my wife and I. Good beer selection as well, staff was friendly and the booths were comfy."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here with Amanda as our server. she was highly attentive and a great host. The food selection was amazing and the portions were very generous. I didn't find the BBQ pork nachos to my liking but there were a ton of other entries I wanted to try. I will definitely come again"}
{"text":"The experience at nacho daddy was a very pleasant one. The staff was great. Gabby was helping us out and making sure we were well taken care of. The food was awesome. I recommend the queso!!"}
{"text":"Back for a second time this trip. The first go was a little rocky, but the girls loved the food and the Assistant Manager Erica came in with the save...our Server MJ also helped to make the night better.  Erica absolutely made an impact so here we are back for round two already off to a great start. We are loving our server Miss Ryan."}
{"text":"This was our first time to Nacho Daddy. When reading the reviews it seems like a love hate kind of thing. We decided that we would check it out and form our own opinion. We will definitely be going back. Our server Keyson asked us if this was our first time there and made some suggestions. My Sweetie had the enchilada nachos and I had the Thai chicken nachos. My Sweetie's plate was delicious but the Thai nachos are by far the most tasty thing I have eaten maybe ever. Spicy with layers of flavor, texture,and complexity. Who would have known that nachos could be raised to that kind of level. We didn't have any adult beverages because he had to go to work and I had some things to get done after dinner. But next time I plan to check out the guava Margarita and maybe a Scorpion Shot. Our server, Keyson was friendly, attentive and made the experience super fun. I will be in his debt for suggesting the most freaking awesome thing I've eaten in a long time."}
{"text":"This is some of best food I've had during my stay in Vegas. Our waiter, Jovanny, was very friendly, accommodating, and attentive. Super fast service and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The margaritas really have some thought put into them. I especially liked the Bloody Mary margarita. If margaritas aren't your thing, their tequila selection is pretty vast!  Enjoyed the filet mignon nachos. I love nachos, and these were...WOW. I'll order these every time!  Prices were a bit high, but I enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff was knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"We ate at this new restaurant yesterday - Saturday - about 2:00 pm.    SO MANY reasons why we will never go back there.  1 - With a name like Nacho Daddy, I would expect that the place would offer a lot more with respect to Nachos - build your own, nacho bar, etc.  This restaurant had none of that - at least we didn't see it.  Our group did order one order of nachos - enchilada style - YUCK - so little melted cheese - you could barely see it.   Not great.   Sent back to kitchen to add a few beans and it took almost 20 minutes - the table was done eating by the time the order came - note:  the restaurant had less than 50 people in it...  2 - Being a new restaurant in this area, they should be better.  Surely there was a manager on duty - but not once did he/she ever walk around and check each table to see how the meal/experience was going...  3 - The chips and salsa and guac ($10) was good - but we will not be back ever.  4 - One person in our party ordered a bowl with beans/chicken - it was delivered on a black rectangular plate- HORRIBLE presentation - very unappetizing.  Although the chicken had good flavor.  For the $, it was not much food though.  How much do black beans/rick really cost you, Nacho Daddy?  Don't mind you making a profit, but you do need to reevaluate your menu pricing.  A little out of line - you have to compete with Chipotle and Cafe Rio just a block away - yes, they are fast casual and Nacho Daddy is not - but families that don't care about drinking a margarita or beer will not be interested in your restaurant more than once, based on your current menu.  5 - 3 people ordered a meal/iced tea and 2 had only chips/guac/salsa/tea -- our bill was $70 (before tip without bar drinks).  For lunch, that is ridiculous.    We will go down the street another block and go to Cafe Rio - it's fast casual, but quality food and fresh ingredients - and the entire meal for us would have been closer to $35...  I'm placing my bet now - Nacho Daddy's will never make it at this location."}
{"text":"Nachos are not as good as advertised, the free margherita's also were bad. For the best nachos in Las Vegas go to Diablo on the strip, also excellent margherita' at Diablos."}
{"text":"Never fails. This is my third visit. Very good service very good food. Nacho daddy you guys earned a loyal customer here. Burger rare with shoe string fries yummmy!! Nachos are bomb. Environment. Is very upbeat. Tv screens everywhere and good for a family of 5+  thumbs up to this place."}
{"text":"This was a great experience! I got the enchilada nachos and my free margarita for checking in. I sat at the bar and the server was very friendly. Manager also came over to see how I liked my good. Overall very good."}
{"text":"Great tasting food and a large selection of both vegan and gluten-free options. Seriously awesome margaritas!  Prices aren't cheap, but not super expensive either. Overall, nice place."}
{"text":"Service levels, there are no service levels in this dump, I sat at the bar, seated by the hostess and never even got acknowledge. Walk out and nobody even notice. Don't bother with this place,"}
{"text":"Awesome service from jovanny.   He was a great server and was always there with a smile as well as super helpful with menu selections.     Awesome house margaritas and chips!!!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a great bar and modern furnishings.The menu is friendly to most all. The waiter was fast and friendly and the food is excellent. I have eaten here many times since it opened and never had an issue."}
{"text":"Videos playing were the best part. Service was pretty good. Food way,way overpriced for mediocre taste at best. Wife was surprised I brought him here after trying it once before. Gave it two shots, won't be back."}
{"text":"Great prices and solid food. You can't go wrong hitting up this place near the strip."}
{"text":"This place is just off Fremont Street.  We went here for a late lunch and it was moderately busy.    The service was prompt and friendly.  We all had drinks in a very short period of time.  The menu is pretty long - there is definitely plenty to choose from.  What I particularly like are the variations on standard Mexican dishes.  For instance, they have Thai chicken nachos and filet mignon nachos.  One of my friends sticks to a more vegetarian/vegan diet and this is the only Mexican place I have ever seen that has vegan options.   I split the Supreme Tostada Nachos with a friend.  The food was delicious.  The nachos came out as a decent sized plate, more than enough to split if you're averagely hungry.    The interior looks like it can be split in two, with sliding panels on top of a half wall so that it can split up the bar and the dining area.  I imagine this makes it better for families and helps keep the place a bit quieter.    I'd definitely be happy to come back here."}
{"text":"The nachos were yummy. I ordered the four cheese nacho with jalapeno. They were definitely generous with the cheese dip which I like. Portion sizes were huge. Service was good too, my friends and I didn't wait long at all for the food to come. Our waiter was nice. They have plenty of vegan options, almost a whole page on the menu. And the prices were very reasonable, it has a wide range, so it fits all budget types. Location wasn't right on the strip which was good for me cause when it's right on the strip it tends to get really busy and crowded. However, it's not far off the strip either, it's about two hundred feet away so it's in walking distance and convenient as well."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place more stars because I thought all the food we ordered (thai chicken nachos + shrimp fajitas for 2) was really tasty, and our waiter was really friendly and prompt, but I just can't get past the price.  WAY overpriced.  Our nachos, fajitas and one drink came out to be almost $60.  That's crazy!"}
{"text":"Really becoming fond of this place.  Love Happy Hour.  Best of all - Jessi recommended the Fried Ice Cream, comes on churro type chips.  Awesome!  Thanks for the recommendation (she's been my waitress every time)."}
{"text":"Very reasonable prices, amazing nachos and rice bowls and even more amazing house margarita!! Strong, but so good. I don't even like margaritas much but these were fantastic. The service was really great and it was a nice break from the typical feel of the strip. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent. Filet Mignon nachos and street tacos hit the spot. Good margaritas and great salsa and great service from Jovanny!!!He went above and beyond for us. Top notch service and tasty food and drinks."}
{"text":"Great service at the bar. We stopped in for a quick bite and a drink before a show.  It was early, 5:45p and there was a moderate crowd. Food was good, as advertised. The Yelp check-in free margarita was a nice perk!"}
{"text":"First time at Nacho Daddy and I have to say I really liked my experience. Our server, Jovany, was super fun, generous and very attentive. He's also the manager ;) so we got great service. The food was delicious and very impressive. Definitely would recommend this hidden gem since it is not located directly on the strip."}
{"text":"Great lunch and drinks! AJ was super helpful, attentive and friendly! Gave us great ideas of things to do in the area and highly recommend this place and him as a server!!!"}
{"text":"Come here a couple times a month.  The food is some of the cheapest on the strip AND the nachos are amazing!  I've never been disapointed with anything I've had here.  Shout out to the best bartenders in the world!  Especially Kimberly!"}
{"text":"The food and the service was pretty good, although the prices seemed a little high.  The reason they just got 3 stars was for cleanliness.  There was a food splatter on our table from the previous diners, a small bug was crawling on the table, and the blinds and window sill had a disgusting amount of dust build up on them."}
{"text":"Very good food and good service. Grab the groupon for a even better deal! I recommend the moco loco nachos!"}
{"text":"This place is INCREDIBLE!! I came here at around 11 pm after a super long road trip from California and I was so happy with the food. I got the vegan fajita bowl and I was so happy with it. The chik'n was seasoned super well and the bottomless chips and salsa were so wonderful :) was a little bit pricey in general but I think the quality of the food was absolutely worth the price. Waiter was also very attentive to refill our drinks and get us anything we needed. Will be coming back next time I'm in Vegas for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Nacho Daddy for a work event and it was amazing! The food was delicious I literally ate until I couldn't breath anymore lol. My excuse was I'm eating for 2! ;) Unfortunately, I was not able to try the cocktails because I'm 41/2 months pregnant but I got to witness my boss and a couple of coworkers do the Scorpion shot and that right there was a memorable evening.. It was a great experience and the service was so incredible I would definitely recommend this location. Thank you so much Debra for your wonderful hospitality and you will be seeing us again soon!"}
{"text":"Great Food and Service. The atmosphere is very nice and the margaritas are excellent."}
{"text":"Food was excellent just had a delish dinner here at Nacho Daddy on Sahara. Great food made better but our wonderful server Tammy. she was attentive, fun, and really wonerful. you will be lucky to have her wait on you."}
{"text":"LOVED this place! Best margaritas I've ever had...and that's saying a lot, I've had a lot of margaritas haha! And our server AJ was fantastic, so friendly and just one of the sweetest most real people I've ever had as a server. He took such good care of us and was more than helpful with tips about the city. Wish I lived nearby, this would absolutely be my go to spot. Thank you AJ, hope to see you soon!!"}
{"text":"Brent and Johnny were outstanding bartenders and the food was amazing! You've got return customer for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food and margaritas! Filet mignon nachos and wings are terrific. Highly recommend for causal Mexican."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy definitely lived up to expectations. The combination of both quest and melted cheddar made the nachos extra tasty. Dolla Bill was an excellent server! Family friendly, and delicious. We will be back."}
{"text":"First time here and definitely recommend!! The environment was probably my favorite thing aside the delicious food. The fiesta Nachos are a must try and the micheladas were soooooooooooooo good!"}
{"text":"Good food and pleasant atmosphere ! Great ritas!!! :) and the bar tender Tiauna was great too! She was on it with the drinks and food ! will go back for more."}
{"text":"The name alone of this place is enough to give it a try. If you love nachos, definitely try this place. My group of five was pretty hungry so we each ordered our own nachos and shared family style. The waitress said one nacho order could feed 2 to 3 people but she didn't know how we do. We ordered the Filet Mignon nacho (BEST!), Buffalo Hot nacho (yummy for those buffalo wing lovers), Nacho Average Burger nacho (tastes like a cheeseburger), Carnitas nacho (SO YUMMY) and some other one that is not on the yelp menu. Obviously, the last one wasn't that memorable so that can be skipped.  They are open 24 hours on the weekend so definitely give this a try on your next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Got the filet minion nacho over priced and under whelming...the scorpion shot is the only reason they are getting two stars...and because you can't give a business negative stars..."}
{"text":"Eh. Ok at best. High price for poor food and service. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great food. And awesome server. Richard was amazing and attentive. Never had to ask for a refill and there were no problems with our order. Would come again!  Side note. Also loved the choice of music and the music videos."}
{"text":"We ate for a house closing / Job celebration, our server Phil was outstanding! Very friendly , happy which made the experience great ! Food was fantastic! Had the fajitas for 2 and the 3 dip appetizer, Fantastic !! Will go again ! Thanks Phil !"}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting a Nacho Daddy.  The atmosphere is very relaxed.  The menu has a ton of options, with many options you couldn't dream up.  We landed on the Mexican street burger with truffle fries, and the super tostado nachos.  Both were excellent.  The plates are huge.  The burger was very tender, the bacon crispy and the fries were amazing.  The nachos are piled high with tons of toppings making them delicious.  I only wish we saved room for deep fried ice cream."}
{"text":"Love Nacho Daddy Summerlin so decided to go to Nacho Daddy at the PH. Sucks to say we waited at the hi top tables in the bar area, where the bartender noticed us, but neglected to say hi or even acknowledge us. (sierra was the bartender), we waited for 10 minutes, then decided to wait another 5 minutes...before going to the hostess stand. Ran into a server named Serena who gladly saved the day, big-ups to Serena... thank you for your great service!!!!"}
{"text":"Wildly mediocre. The Irish nachos has so much mustard they were inedible, the knife work is aweful. How are you supposed to eat chips with a giant chunk of meat that is 5 inches long? It's nachos for God sake. Either way, I wouldn't recommend you eat here at all. We ordered two Cadillac margaritas and barely had a buzz for $50. On top of that our waiter was MIA our whole meal.  Unless you want to spend $100 and walk away being disappointed."}
{"text":"Many people come in and out of our lives every day. But some people you never forget.   Javony is one of those people.  As we walked in, it was hard to miss his presence in the room. He was teaching an impromptu salsa class to a bachelorette party while chatting up a nearby table of WWII Purple Heart veterans, impressing them with his deep knowledge of twentieth century post-war geopolitics. At the same time he was calmly performing the heimlich on an over excited frat boy. All smiles, casually exuding Bill Clinton levels of charisma, Javony welcomed us to Nacho Daddy.   The conversation zigged and zagged between unconscious bias, the Syrian refugee crisis, Chinese calligraphy, and his recent paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine. His fresh take on tired issues reinvigorated my views and forced me to question everything I knew. The hours flew by - as I felt the conflicts between mind, soul, and body melt away in his calming presence.   Javony would never say this himself but following his double stint in the peace corps (Malawi and Haiti) he donated both kidneys (and two thirds of his liver) to a baby panda.  Having passively made millions in Silicon Valley selling his car safety algorithm to Tesla (saving millions of future lives), Jovany decided that with all options ahead of him and no need to work a day in his life, he would help people from all over the world find their true selves. What better place to do that than Nacho Daddy Las Vegas - the veritable crossroads of human civilization (try the queso it's like making out with Buddha Jesus and Moses at the same time).  I can only hope you, too, can share even a moment, a glance, a thought, a smile, or a margarita with Jovany at Nacho Daddy - a professional human being."}
{"text":"Their food is decent, but their margaritas are a hit. Come here for drinks and food on a late night. But mainly for drinks! Check in for one on the house!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Filet mignon nachos were almost as great as our waitress, Victoria. Thanks for the amazing service and recommendations!"}
{"text":"Loved sitting at the bar on cinco d mayo Desi is supper sweet.  Never seen nachos like this. Tried the buffalo chicken nachos."}
{"text":"This was a lot of fun. Much better than I expected. Average portions that taste pretty good. The difference maker was the great customer service. I will definitely be back. Had a nice menu that I want to sample. Happy Hour menu was good. Lots to choose from. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The service was on point.  The food was delicious.  And dessert was different with favor.  I have to cover back for happy hour and drinks."}
{"text":"Very friendly wait staff.  Nice clean environment.  Good margaritas.  Chips and salsa cost extra, but not much.  The nachos are large enough for 2 people and quite the variety of toppings.  We had buffalo chicken, it worked."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. My favorite meal in Vegas so far. I had the tostada supreme nachos and wifey had a Thai chicken bowl. Both very good. But the nachos. Man. The nachos. Every nacho was full of toppings. We also did the yelp check in for a free house margarita. You can upgrade to a different flavor for just the price difference. We opted for the blackberry margarita with a sugar rim. Soooo good."}
{"text":"Yay for the Vegan menu!!!!!  Great tastes, not just your average vegan flavors (i.e. bland).  They did a great job on incorporating real favors into the meals.    Went on a Monday night and it wasn't terribly busy (which was good) but it was loud (which was not so good).  Haven't found a place on the Strip that is inexpensive-ish and not too loud whether busy or not.  I swear they have the street ambience playing on the sound system along with the music!  LOL"}
{"text":"Everyone be on the look out for Dolla Bill, he's an amazing server and has a great since of humor . Seriously, I've only been here 5 minutes and have already almost had my water come out of my nose . Ps. He likes complicated orders & they don't sell pita bread so don't ask."}
{"text":"Jovanny was the best!! We happened on this place by accident... just walked by. So glad we stopped by!!! The Thai chicken nachos and corn were tasty and great! We also had a birthday celebration. Jovanny made the birthday so special!  He is an excellent server!  THANK YOU!!  And. Audre was an awesome host, we wish she could've joined us!"}
{"text":"This was a great family experience for our last night in Las Vegas, Wednesday night, when we walked in Angela greated us with a smile, and we felt very welcomed , our kids enjoyed the experience also, the hostess was so sweet as she gave our older child a kids menu and an adult menu, he was excited about that, he is at the age where he is in-between child and adult menu, great coustomer service. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Ate here in a pinch late night... Mainly because the name sounded delicious. And their log line is something about gourmet nachos. Gourmet they are not. I was disappointed with the type of chip they used - more like Tostitos than anything authentic to great Mexican cuisine. They do have a good number of vegan options so that was nice. Limited craft beer menu as well. Margaritas were OK."}
{"text":"Great texmex cuisine and an excellent beer selection. Dolla Bill is the kind of server you wish you could get everywhere you go."}
{"text":"We had a table of 8 and our server Kelly was so wonderful. She was on top of everything. She was kind & had a great attitude. The food was amazing. We had a great time and our server even helped us sing happy birthday. It was a clean environment & the lighting was perfect."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy is so so good! This was my first time in Vegas, and this was definitely my favorite spot! Cool atmosphere, great service. GREAT MARGARITAS"}
{"text":"This place is legit, even if you are from Cali. Sometimes it's hard to find good Mexican food elsewhere. If you like nachos, this place is amazing. Great nachos and tacos. Will definitely go back and would highly recommend you check them out if you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of five and was seated immediately. Friendly staff, great food and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Food here was delicious - especially stoked that they had a vegan section on the menu! Had some delicious \"chicken\" street tacos and the chips and \"queso.\" Husband enjoyed his pork (real pork) tacos, too. Our server (Ryan) was really attentive. Great atmosphere, too. Will be back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to have another Mexican restaurant open in my neighborhood. I gave this place a try not long after it was open and I was extremely underwhelmed. Nothing was horrible, just below par of what I can get other places that are also nearby and in competition with this one. The food was only ok and the margaritas were fair. I will order a house margarita on the rocks every time and I feel that is a great way to base there drinks if the house is good.  I always sit in the bar area because it is always livelier. It took me many months to give them a second shot, and when I did, I had the exact same results. I feel that there are way too many places to get better food and experience for my money."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service 10/10 would recommend! Our server Richard was super on the ball and had an awesome personality (and beard)! I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Ryan he was a great server and really knows his tequilas. Gave great recommendations on what to get to eat. Thanks so much."}
{"text":"Ok, seriously the best nachos I've ever had. Hands down awesome. I couldn't stop eating the fiesta chicken nachos. My husband tried the sloppy joe nachos and said the were great also."}
{"text":"This place is absolute garbage. Doesn't even qualify as \"Mexican\" food, because there was no flavor and no authentic ingredients typically found at a Mexican restaurant. Unless you're drunk and just looking for a bar to take shots at and/or grab a margarita skip this place. Seriously. There's a Chipotle inside Planet Hollywood only a short walk away. Go there instead."}
{"text":"I had the garlicky shrimp nachos and they were sooo good. I even took them to my room and ate them cold and they still rocked my world. Of course I had a margarita and for dessert I had the fried ice cream. That was really good also. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing place and staff!!! Arieanna was beyond amazing!!  PLEASE VISIT! Came here on a Monday day so the strip was slow but the service was great. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted and treated like loyal customers. Quickly seated and the food selection is just perfect. Our server arieanna was great with answering questions, communication, conversation and good service. If you're ever in Las Vegas, I recommend you stop by for lunch or dinner to continue enjoying a great night l."}
{"text":"My first time here and Gabby & Gio were super friendly and helpful.   She gave us tips on  the food and other local places to visit while in town.   We will definitely come back for the food and service."}
{"text":"This place is really cool! Not so busy for a Saturday evening, but the atmosphere is nice. There's a lot of options to choose from the menu and our waiter, Richard (10/10 great guy), was very helpful and nice! He knew the menu and answered all of our questions on the food and even gave us recommendations! The food was good and the naked chicken wings were amazing!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service at the bar and the AGM keeps it tight!  Would recommended to anyone!"}
{"text":"After looking at pictures and reading reviews, my whole family was definitely excited about coming here. Our experience started out pretty well, we had a very friendly waitress who was very attentive. After about a 30 minute wait, the guy comes over with our food, with two mistakes. My sisters both ordered fish tacos without cilantro, and they came out as shrimp rather than fish, and it was topped with cilantro. 3 stars is sufficient enough for this place, their food and service are top-notch, though there are a few flaws overall... An above-average place, but did not meet our expectations."}
{"text":"Pulled pork nachos...ummm yes please !! So good ! And beer was great !"}
{"text":"A special shout out to Michael our waiter. Awesome food, food allergies covered, close to the strip, and it's a sports bar."}
{"text":"This place is great... loved the Supreme. Nachos. And the street tacos were great! The service that Antony provided was super :)"}
{"text":"As soon as we entered, we were welcomed by the most gracious server I've ever met, Jovanny . The chips were warm and crunchy. Their salsa is the ! I ordered the Street Taco with lobster and crab and the taste is heavenly. Our 2 mile walk was so worth it. Everyone was friendly and accommodating but I give my hats off to Jovanny for his warm and wonderful attitude!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first and last visit to this place. I ordered takeout last night. When i walked in, no one was there to greet me. I actually waited there for about 5 minutes before i decided to walk throughout the restaurant to find someone to help me. Once i found someone, they told me they would be right with me. They took my food to the front where i waited another 5 minutes before someone came to close out the check. If that wasnt frustrating enough, got back to my room with the food and it was cold. And I'm sure that didnt help the taste because i ordered the baja combo and it was just disgusting. Seafood enchilada smelled bad and i had one bite and threw it away. The worst mexican food I've had. So disappointing. Never again."}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem. It's right around the corner from PBR and Buffalo Wild Wings which means it's 50ft off the actual strip and everything is priced really well! Don't feel like paying $20 for a margarita or $30 for a meal? Turn the corner and go here because it's amazing! My husband ordered the Thai Nachos and had no complaints! We sat at the bar and had the best service of the entire weekend. The street tacos were just as good if not better than any local Mexican place in soCal. Most importantly, the drinks are strong and yummy! Definitely give this place a try if you're on this end of the strip!"}
{"text":"A nacho lover's paradise. They had so many selections of nachos it was so hard to choose! The margaritas were also excellent and our server was absolutely fabulous. I definitely think we need a Nacho Daddy up in Canada. But until then, I'll keep visiting this location the next time I'm down in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Quick review.  I didn't have high expectations, but was still disappointed. The cheese dip we had as an appetizer was pretty good, but the chicken fajitas were sub par. Worse than a Chili's. The chicken was dry and overcooked and the side dish of rice and beans were inedible in my opinion. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Very yummy food and our server Tyler was very attentive and awesome! Great atmosphere and awesome drinks too!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Their nacho so good and the services best.  Check in on yelp and get free house Margarita."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Downtown and now it's in my backyard. This has been a long time coming!! I'm so excited to have an amazing restaurant that  offers vegan and vegetarian options  - and great selections for all of you carnivores.  My favorite dishes on the menu hands down are the vegan nachos and the fish tacos. Insane in the membrane delicious! Queso was incredible and the drinks, well, let me just say - the margaritas taste like magic liquid gold - smooth and rich! Not sure about that Scorpion shot they talk about but hey - I'm game. Maybe just once.   The staff is awesome! The hostess was so smiley and bubbly. The servers were crazy attentive, polite, friendly and super nice. They made us feel right at home, even though it was our first time there. It was like a Norm from Cheers moment - everyone seemed to know our name. I love that feeling that somewhere is \"our\" spot and I guarantee, my husband and I will be back often for breakfast (yay!), lunch and dinner - or to watch some games or just have a nice family dinner.   Now I'm hungry!"}
{"text":"Bomb.com! This restaurant was so good. Customer service was really great also. I'm happy my family and I choose this place. We ordered nachos, quesidillas, and enchiladas all so good and prices are reasonable also. My kids loved the live scorpions at the door. Great place we will definitely  be going back!"}
{"text":"I say my favorite place to go for nachos there's never a line but they're always busy they took the time to make sure you're happy my wife and kids love it we will go there at least once a week they treat us like family"}
{"text":"Anthony our server was so nice and efficient! The filet mignon  street tacos were the so good! Oh and the best margarita!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Quick food for a great price and fun environment.  The manager Jovany was amazing very helpful"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've had in Vegas! They have a wide variety of tequila and good beers on tap. All that plus great service from the bartender makes this one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying that yelp gave me a warning that there were multiple reviews done on the same IP address. With that said, we still wanted to give them a chance because they welcome families.  My review is more based on the service and perception.  Experience: We walked in and there are four hostess One with her back towards the entrance. They turn and look at us but did not say anything. Finally, one of the girls in the back turns to my kid and asked how many? Our server seemed to be rushing us to order drinks and order off the menu not giving us any time to look. We ordered our drinks and our food. I tell him I have a free house margarita for the Yelp check-in. He brings it over and All you can taste is the syrup, grossest margarita ever with no alcohol. I checked and made sure their house margarita had alcohol, I only took one sip and my jaw hurt. Tried mixing it and it still gross that i gave up.   Food: We ordered the shrimp spicy nachos with spinach chips, chicken enchilada nachos, and the cheese quesadilla. The food was maybe a 3.5 to 4 star quality.   Prices are good and location is good too, it's away from the strip maybe about a block away so it's not as busy and also not that far.   Overall I would not return and would not recommend. Also, next time I'll listen to yelp when it says something suspicious about the five-star reviews."}
{"text":"The Fajitas were excellent. the tortilla's were not as fresh as they ought to be."}
{"text":"As a vegan in Vegas, my options were sooooo limited.   A restaurant on the Strip with multiple vegan-friendly dishes came as a total surprise.  My friends and I walked here after a pool party and wanted something fulfilling and sobering.   We had the coolest server ever. So chill and laid back, yet attentive and professional. He reassured me the vegan Chik'n nachos were so good, I would seriously think I was eating meat.   He was SO right. Even a guy friend of mine who is a devout meat eater had to admit he enjoyed it. This review is actually 5 months later, because I'm back in Texas and I can't get my mind off of these bombbbb nachos. LOL"}
{"text":"Great margaritas, food and service. Wish there was a Nacho Daddy in the Chicago area."}
{"text":"Shrimp nachos are filling and very flavorful. The spice warning does not disappoint. I love the heck outta the nacho ideas. And I am very hard to please I'm quite the foodie. By I will return for the shrimp nachos. The kids and husband love it too."}
{"text":"I received a flyer in the mail on Sept 14th; we went to give it a try on Sept 16th around 7:30pm - the \"Ghost pepper chili nacho\" were pictured in this ad; and really the only reason i wanted to try this place.  Since there was a coupon we thought why not?  Well why not is because when we ordered the ghost pepper chili nachos we were told that was a seasonal item and not available.  How seasonal is it when its featured in a flyer 2 days old??? The Spicy Shrimp nachos' were recommended by the manager. The were aweful...the tortilla soup had no flavor; beers were very expensive for a neighborhood place.  Needless to say....we wont waste our time - coupon or not!!!!"}
{"text":"Very close to the strip. Solid vegan nachos and vegan quesadilla. It was great food to help soak up the dole whip daiquiri I had been sipping on earlier that day.  Food was easy to share. Bathroom was clean enough. Service was good and accommodating."}
{"text":"Been looking forward to trying this place out since I booked my trip to Vegas. It didn't disappoint. I am new to the vegan eating so this place was a much needed experience for me. I got the vegan chicken nachos. They were great. I miss nacho cheese but the vegan nacho cheese was pretty close and got the job done. Bonus was checking in got my wife a free house margarita. Only thing I could complain about would be the price but it's Vegas and it's not a fast food restaurant so you can't expect dollar menu prices. When I comeback to Vegas I will love to comeback to eat."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour in town!!!! $1 Coronas . Can't beat that anywhere. I usually don't leave reviews unless the service was horrible but treated me with First class. Davor was our Bartender. Super cool dude. He even let me borrow cell phone charger haha. Will be back soon.."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised as someone on the sidewalk suggested this restaurant. The food was great and many different staff would stop by the table to see if we needed anything and to make sure we were happy with everything."}
{"text":"Jovanny was our server and he was awesome!  I ordered the ceviche, the Supreme nachos, and the watermelon Margarita.  Chef Ruben ?? even came out to see that everything tasted good.  I will definitely come back when I'm here in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Run-of-the-mill chain Mexicanish food and not that great of beverages. Look elsewhere for a family Mexican establishment."}
{"text":"We came to this place for its nachos and scorpion shot and oh boy they did not disappoint!  The scorpion shot is a must-try.  You just order a shot of anything and you can add on a baby scorpion.  They have many varieties of nachos such as filet mignon, spicy shrimp, and lobster and crab just to name a few.   The whole staff was super nice but Bryce was awesome!  He was professional but also friendly, chatty, and cool.  We are actually planning to return on Thursday just so that we can hang with Bryce again!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Had an overall great experience. We ordered the Vegan Chickn Tacos and the Vegan Loaded Nachos with chickn added. This was seriously the best vegan chickn we've had in a meal.. we couldn't believe it. Our waitress Audre was great and let us know all about the vegan options such as how they make their chickn and queso in house. Wish we were staying longer.. one of the best meals we've ever had!!   Will be back any chance we get!"}
{"text":"I went there with three friend on a Monday night and it was pretty short-staffed. We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table although there were free ones... But as we finally ordered, the food came quickly and was tasty! Prices were good, too."}
{"text":"Get the triple dip  Get everything. It is so good. Best Mexican in Vegas at a cheap price for the strip."}
{"text":"Saturday night was our first visit to this establishment. When we asked for chips and salsa for our table of four we were informed that there would be a charge. this is the first Mexican restaurant I've ever been in from San Francisco down to the Baja that charged for a simple basket of tortilla chips and salsa. we were shocked. That was the beginning of a very mediocre meal. the ceviche came in a tiny bowl with a few tiny shrimp. it was a very disappointing visit. with so many other excellent Mexican restaurants within a 3 mile radius we will not be going there again.    Jo-Ann G."}
{"text":"This place was amazing ! The first time I was there was unfortunately during the mass shooting but I went back the next day & even thoe you felt the hurt in Vegas , the employees at nacho daddy made it feel better. Btw our waiter the night before really honestly saved us , don't remember her name but she was awesome!! Try the tacos  and the margaritas were amazing"}
{"text":"Great fresh, tasty food, great service and no wait! It seems almost every other place, especially in the casino areas, has an hour wait; not here. Also, the price point on the menu was about half of the other places we went to.   Give it a try if you want a great Mexican food experience, with gluten-free and Vegan options!"}
{"text":"This was our first meal during our Vegas trip and it did not disappoint! We all got different margaritas which we all loved (I got the frozen house margarita and it was tasty and strong!) We got the trio with chips which came with salsa, guac, and queso which were all surprisingly good since guac is always a hit or miss. I got the shrimp tacos which were a make your own and came with a side of tortillas which was a perfect meal. Overall, for a yummy lunch or dinner right off of the strip, this place is reasonably priced and GOOD.  The atmosphere is also great - when we went they were playing 90s rock music and had the patio open. We set right on the edge of the restaurant and the patio and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Great service ask for Judy. Food was amazing I had the enchilada and the supreme nachos. They are open  at 8am. Serve lunch all day."}
{"text":"The naked wings and filet mignon nachos were so good. Richard was great! Thanks for taking care of us."}
{"text":"Always a great job no matter what time of day or server. Food is always fresh and drinks are refilled timely."}
{"text":"There were 4 of us who dined at this restaurant in Nov 2016. Veggie Spicy Burrito was good. The spicy sauce made it taste good. However, Burrito by itself tasted bland and had more tofu taste. Spicy sauce is very spicy so be careful. Veggie Loaded Nacho was good. Not great though! Enchiladas is good. However, my in-law had ordered some chicken plate and was very dry and we had to replace it with another enchilada. First it took them a while to get his order out and then to find it was all dry. Then by the time enchilada came, not much hunger or mood left! However, their dessert dried ice-cream was really good. The cancelled item showed up on the receipt and we asked them to cancel it which they honored.  Friendly customer service. But overall food was okay. Definitely try their Fried Ice-Cream! 1 Spicy Burrito = $12.95 1 V. Loaded Nacho = $14.95 2 Enchiladas = $19 Add Peppers = $1 Add Mushrooms = $0.50 1 Fried Ice-Cream = $8.95 Personally we will never visit this place."}
{"text":"Sahara location is huge, but definitely not a happening place. They have a ton of TVs and play these super annoying 80s videos! Margaritas r really good, nachos r ok, and they don't have a huge selection of combo dinners or even main courses... This is my second time coming here and I'm not impressed at all!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend decided to come to Nacho Daddy's (Summerlin Location) for her birthday. When we walked in the hostess just looked at us and gave a blank look, quite rude. She leaves and another employee comes to answer the phone doesn't ask if we've been helped and walks away. After five minutes of standing by the front door, my friend decides Ricardo's on Decatur/Flamingo would be worth the drive than to further subject ourselves to this experience. The only reason why I gave 2 stars, is other reviews say the food is great, perhaps I'll never know I've never eaten here and simply because they kept the front doors open."}
{"text":"Greasy tacos! 15 bucks for two tacos... Should have went to another place. Honestly could have went to taco bell because their beef taco taste the same as taco bell."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Our waitresses, Victoria, recommended the lobster enchiladas and they were incredible."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy is not that good. I went there and from my experience I did not feel like their chips were made in house. Not that that is important but I don't know if I was going to be marketing nachos I would try to make my own chips and I do not like it when I order nachos ma pile on some chips and then they pour everything on top because then none of the chips get anything on the bottom. I guess it's really bothered me because I don't know anybody that likes it like that and you're calling yourself nacho Daddy's you should know that people like the chips and all the toppings to be intermingled. The ambience is okay not that great and the customer service was okay nothing special kind of pricey"}
{"text":"Waited 12 minutes for a waiter after being seated.  No one ever showed up.  Got up and left.  Avoid at all costs!!"}
{"text":"Nachos Daddy is great place for lovers of nachos!! They use real cheese which is mandatory criteria for good  nachos!!! Great margaritas. W. Sahara location has great decor & great service. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Everything was good.  The free margarita you get for checking in was way better than I expected. We went twice during our 4 day trip. The first time, we got the buffalo chicken nachos and the spicy shrimp nachos. I opted out of the spinach chips (the bf is a picky eater) and got regular chips. I wish I would've tasted the spinach ones though.   Second time we got the buffalo chhicken again (the white queso is yummy) and the tostada nachos. I think out of the four, the tostada nachos are the largest. Two orders were enough to share for sure.    The place is a little confusing to find; make sure you turn left (southbound) on Harmon from Las Vegas boulevard. It's there on the left. I don't think you can get in there from the inside of the planet Hollywood mall."}
{"text":"Really good food! And great prices! I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Vegas. The drinks are strong too! We got two free drinks for checking in which was amazing. The waiter was super nice. Overall this place is great."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. We were told that our server was Brent and he never came to the table. Instead, he stood behind the bar and stared at us for 7+ minutes. The people I held the door for were served their food before we were served our water. When we told the assistant manager she did nothing about it and stood behind the bar with Brent and conversed. People that came in around the time we got our water got their food before us. We were not asked how our food was until we were done and then our waiter immediately pulled out the check. Personally, I think this meal should have been free. We had to get out of our seats to give someone the check because we wanted to leave so bad. The food was good but the service stinks. I would not recommend this place to anyone that I know, not even my worst enemy. It was a waste of time. Brent was immediately serving the people that sat behind us when they sat down so why not us? If I could I would leave no stars, one star simply because the food was good quality. Hopefully you guys can learn from this experience, to better your service."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 stars just so people can notice, although most of the time it deserves 5 starts.   I have been to Nacho Daddy many times and I'm never disappointed. However, my last experience was dinner for my birthday with my whole family was terrible. The Golden Knights game was on so they were very busy.  It was a group of 7 people, which the hostess told us would take 15 minutes to set up our table. Understandable. However, apparently our table had been ready for 20 minutes without us being seated because they simply forgot about us. Then getting to our table and ordering drinks, it took a very long time for us to get our alcoholic beverages. Service was not as good as usual, but it was probably because they were busy from the game.   *Important* I ordered the vegan fajita bowl and I received something that looked like it. I took a bite out of the \"vegan chicken\" and realized it was not vegan and ACTUAL chicken. I was very upset and told them the fact that I haven't eaten chicken in over three years. They also gave one of my family members a salad with onions, which he said no onion because he is highly allergic.   Needless to say, they paid for our meal, which is what they should have done. But I want to make sure that the vegans and people with allergies out there check their food before they eat it so they don't get sick for the meat allergy or other allergies. I got sick after eating a piece of real chicken because of my allergy to meat."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Service was incredible. Mikey was our server and I have never seen someone so accommodating and kind at such a young age. When you have a family of 7, your meal depends on a lot of things. Which kid is crying when, who gets their food first, etc. Mikey made sure that every aspect of our meal was effortless. I would go back just for his service."}
{"text":"Great service! Lots of vegetarian options with tofu and soy protein. Bar tender was super nice with recommendations and suggestions. Was honest and service is very quick."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The food is great, the service is great, it's clean!!! Love nacho daddy will go again and again..."}
{"text":"I came here with my daughter while waiting to pick up my husband from work near by recently and was pretty amazed. The atmosphere is great, very open, spacious, and fun. The staff is very attentive, friendly and genuine. Erica, a manager, came to check on our table as well as another manager or supervisor. The host was super sweet and helpful as well as our server. The food was also great! It came pretty quick, and was fresh and hot. Definitely recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"We decided to try there food on Sunday ,we ordered our food and the waiter was really nice no complaints at all. The food took a long time to come out and was cold and soggy .We send it back sent the second time a steak taco came out ice cold. The prices were to expensive and I won't go back. I felt bad for the server he really tried."}
{"text":"Eh it was okay , the service was very slooooow .  We ordered the supreme nachos ,  they were tasty , the portion was small to medium . I've had better and bigger portion as an appetizer at Applebee's or TGI Fridays  .  They did have interesting menu options for nacho toppings , lobster chicken etc ."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Our waiter took really good care of us. It was worth our walk to find it!"}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy is nacho typical Mexican place.  Great Mexican food found right outside Planet Hollywood.  Opens late until three on the weekend.  Free margarita when you check in on yelp.  Excellent service and well made drinks by the super awesome waitress, Cerah.  At this visit my buddy and I ordered chips and salsa, wings, lobster and crab enchiladas, 4 cheese nachos, and filet mignon street tacos.    Chips are fresh, simple and bottomless.  The lobster and crab enchiladas are flavorful and surprisingly the rice that comes with the combo is delicious.  Four cheese nachos also simple and great for cheese lovers.  The street tacos are good; however, the meat itself is slightly dry.   Overall a great experience.  I recommend this and I don't do reviews often.  Definitely one of my go to places when I'm in Vegas.    Try the scorpion shot; I tried it my first visit and it was fun.  You can either swallow or chew the scorpion, really doesn't have much taste outside your tequila.  You get a souvenir shot glass when you try it."}
{"text":"4 stars only because they messed up our order...twice. Besides that the food was amazing!!! The BBQ chicken nachos were my favorite. We went during happy hour (3-6) and ordered a bunch of different mini plates to try everything. Our waitress was so nice as well checking on us every few minutes. Margaritas were really good but the Michelada wasn't my fav. Overall really great food definitely come if you're hungry their normal size portions are huge!"}
{"text":"Not great food and don't even try to have it delivered.. it will be an hour late and when you complain, they will try to charge you twice."}
{"text":"Best Nachos I've had in Las Vegas. It doesn't hurt that our server Erica was the best!! I'd go there over and over just for her service, and the nachos too!"}
{"text":"Our waiter Aerrick made our visit to Nacho Daddy a GREAT EXPERIENCE. Amazing energy, fantastic smile, and on top of everything! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great salsa.  Great food...I got the fish tacos.  We've tried tons of Mexican restaurants on the west side and this place has been the best so far.  It was pretty empty when we went in.  Service was polite and prompt.  Great job Nacho Daddy.  I can't wait to eat there again."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food. The probably was the service. Our server MJ did not explain to us their nachos which is what their are famous for. My order came out wrong twice and had to wait while the others in my party were more than half way done with their plates. I was charged wrong on my bill, after correcting it, she decided to go to three other tables before coming back to pick up the bill. Other than the service, I would recommend going there for their food."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The margaritas were good, the cheese nachos very good, but to be honest our server made the lunch. Thanks Alex!"}
{"text":"I have now eaten here twice. Service has been great(Ryan was awesome). The Supreme Nachos were amazing. If you are looking for a place that has good prices and great food, Nacho Daddy is the place. A little off the strip next to Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"Not what I expected from the name. Figured it was a Taco Bell type place.  Wrong.  Excellent food.  The chips and salsa was outstanding as was the guacamole.  I had a burrito smothered in green/verde sauce.  The chicken was shredded and melt in your mouth.  Wife had fish tacos that she said we excellent.  Service was very good and prices were great considering we were in Vegas on the strip. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy is the best spot for margaritas and nachos! The atmosphere is great and the service is amazing. Jovany is the nicest waiter and my new best buddy! Thanks Nacho Daddy I'll be back soon"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner. The host was polite and seated us immediately. The waiter seemed uninterested greeted us and went through the motions but didn't appear to want to be there. The food was out of this world. I am not usually a big fan of Mexican food however the chicken tacos were awesome. They came with a side of refried beans and rice both were adequate but the chicken tacos were the star of the dish.  All other Mexican restaurants I have eaten at offer complementary chips & salsa this place doesn't. The salsa is good and labeled appropriate for heat level. The chips were good. The soft taco shells were awesome. I can't speak for the drinks however my associate who had a margarita said it was very good. Would eat there again."}
{"text":"I was extremely pleased with this restaurant. I went for lunch and just had a sandwich with fries. The food was great, the staff was beyond friendly and everything came out fast. Also, the 80s music video feed was...intriguing. I'll try the nachos next time, each one that came out looked great."}
{"text":"We trusted all the great reviews and weren't disappointed. Loved this place. Daddy's Margaritas were unique enough to feel special. A little more limey! We also had the Triple Dip - guac was chunky and buttery, just how I like it. Super smooth cheesy queso and spicy salsa with fantastic flavor. The smothered chicken burrito was huge. Smokey red enchilada sauce was the best! Great service from Ryan as well. We might even go back this same trip."}
{"text":"I was here for the first time on Monday. I heard lots of good things about this place. The food was excellent, the service was great, and the atmosphere of the 80s is unbelievable.   I am given it a 3 star because when we first arrive, the hostess told us that there was a 25 minutes wait (it's a good sign that they are busy, I thought), however, when we were seated, I saw and counted 18 tables empty. For that reason alone I gave  it a 3 star."}
{"text":"This was definitely the best food and service I've had in Vegas! Jacob was amazing and the fried ice cream was on point!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The manager was great. The food was very good! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Good environment, good food, and good drinks. I had the chicken fajita salad which had a great flavor, nice and fresh. Guacamole is to die for!"}
{"text":"This place is really good and very trendy. It had veggie options for my husband and it's big portions. The people are nice and seems clean place. The deep fried ice cream is really good Service was really good as well."}
{"text":"First time here the food and atmosphere was amazing. I give them an A+ for customer service. Huck is the best!!"}
{"text":"Menu is a tex-mex hybrid featuring unique takes on nachos and Mexican fare.  Shared the bbq chicken nachos with the husband. The bbq flavor has a great sweet and savory combo with a slight chili powder dimension that is great to eat! The black beans, corn and white cheese go well with the succulent chicken. Although it was a great change to traditional nachos, we did miss the sour cream and guac you expect to find with nachos.  We will more than likely head back to another one of the Nacho Daddy locations."}
{"text":"Good is great very filling and the house drink for free when you check in is great one of the best margaritas I've had"}
{"text":"The best Nacho place I have ever had! The staff was friendly and courteous the food there is so good we had to go back a second time before we traveled back home. There margaritas are also really good and strong so be very cautious on the amount you drink."}
{"text":"We had a large group (25) and MJ was great ! Fast service and great food. The street tacos we're perfect !"}
{"text":"I love Nacho Daddy! I had the most amazing time, as always, at the bar. Jade and Arnold are the best bartenders in Vegas, they were so much fun and informative. We ended up with the Enchilada Nachos, and 2 SCORPION shots! That's right, REAL scorpions. A must stop next time you're in the city of sin! And did I mention how hilarious the hostess was?! Thank you for making my girlfriend's Vegas trip so memorable!"}
{"text":"Official rating: 3 1/2 stars (if I could)   Start to Finish:  - Visited approximately 2 weeks after their official grand opening. All the paint and decor looked almost identical to Firefly (restaurant in this space before it became nacho daddy).   - Great Mix of 80's and 90's music playing with accompanying music videos, but was weird to see/hear at Nacho Daddy.   - Very large menu with only 1 page of nacho dishes. I was disappointed in the selection of different nacho dishes and the fact that the rest of the menu was simply a Mexican restaurant menu. Also, the nacho dishes were listed as appetizers. I was told they would be enough for a meal. I was hungry when I finished my plate of nachos and was hungry when I left the restaurant.   - Purchased the Florentine and Nacho Average Burger Nachos. The Florentine were absolutely delicious and were a play on an Italian dish essentially with prosciutto and some other goodies on top. The burger nachos were not too bad. We had the snores dessert nachos to finish things off which were pretty interesting/tasty.  - The prices were a bit high for nacho appetizers $12-$15+.  - my wife was excited about their extensive/diverse, coffee menu. Unfortunately, they staff was not trained on how to make any of them and only regular coffee was available. A let down.  - Our server was nice and the service was decent. We had to wait a long period to get the check as the waitress seemed to disappear for a bit. Not the do all end all, but not the smoothest so would have liked.   - OVERALL, the food was yummy, prices were a bit high, and it was a cool place to go as a novelty.  It seemed to have some identity issues with the mix of music, videos, etc. I don't think I'll be returning although I recommend giving it a try if you want to go somewhere different and are in the mood for Mexican.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We liked it a lot. We had the queso and chips with added hamburger. The queso has a great taste and the chips were perfect. We each had the chicken tortilla soup and thought it was good too. Kind of a Mexican tomato soup with lots of chicken. The service was very good and we liked the decor."}
{"text":"Do not hesitate to dine here! Great service and delicious food. That is all. Our server went out of his way to put a smile on our faces. The burritos and nachos were delicious."}
{"text":"Nice surprise.  Delicious fajitas.  Great service.  Nice ambience.  Good value.  Reservations accepted."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after seeing all the rave reviews. I wouldn't classify it as the best Mexican food but the margaritas were excellent! Use the free house margarita offered through Yelp if it is still available. This margarita was very smooth, I even opted to order a second. The service here is unmatched...never felt I was searching for our server who was prompt at exchanging out my beef street tacos for something else when I discovered they were way too spicy for my pallet."}
{"text":"Arieanna is so incredibly awesome. She gave us great recommendations since this was our first time. Could not have asked for better service. Food was delicious and prepared perfectly. Arieanna was patient and so perfect. Make sure you ask for her next time you are here."}
{"text":"Best nachos EVER!!!!  We had the Cajun nachos and Supreme Tostada and we had to take doggie bags.  No disappointment.  Definitely will be coming back.  Pricey BUT well worth it. Cajun has several types of meat plus shrimp.  Supreme was altered, I changed it from beef to chicken and oh my Goshhhhh!!!  OUR server Paula was the bomb!!!  Me and my guy both admitted that she's the best server we've had. It was easy to tip her past the 20%.. She made my bday SOOOOOO worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Great job Victoria! Thanks for the great service and attentiveness. The drinks were great and the food was amazing!!!! Definitely a go-to spot when visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"First stop on our Vegas weekend and  our server Jovanny rocked it! Must stop for Daddy's Margarita and Nachos!"}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high but the food was good and not great"}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best when it comes to nachos, cheese, and deserts. The service was exceptional. You must ask for Laekyn specifically she is a great server she is super fast, outgoing, positive and a great attitude. I love this place and we will be back."}
{"text":"Everything we tasted here was amazing... the fiesta nachos, the dry rubbed wings and the margarita was perfect. It wasn't weak but not too strong. Our server Kierstan was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome drinks! Also, get a free margarita when you check in! Loved that they have breakfast all day."}
{"text":"NACHOS will never be be same for me. SO good.  I ordered and split the filet mignon nachos. I ordered a side of queso and that really just made them that much better - if it was possible.  The pico wasn't all watery and chunky tomatoes & onions. The guacamole was perfect amount. Sour cream drizzle was devine.  The filet was cooked juicy, and not dried out.  The cheese and beans all blended together very well!!! Loved it. The name is hilarious as well.  You get a house margarita if you check in on Yelp - but you can also put that $8.95 toward a \"nicer\" margarita.  Definitely worth going."}
{"text":"I had the best time at Nacho Daddys the other night. It was my first time there and I asked the server for a recommendatiin. Gabby who is also new and in training when over the menu and I finally decided on the Frajitas along with a whit peach margaritas. My friends picked their favorites. Service was great throughout the sercive. Gabby was a real gem. She is positive and really wanted our experience to be as great as the food. We all loved our choices.  Prices are also reasonable. Will rate 5 star and will be back soon"}
{"text":"So I decided to try this place on the strip due to its proximity to my hotel and it's high YELP reviews.  My wife my stepson and I walked into a restaurant and while it was busy it didn't seem packed.  We were told it was a 25 minute wait.  The wait was accurate and we were sat by a very friendly hostess.  There was a pretty good delay between being sat and being greeted but once we were greeted our server was friendly and attentive.  We did not order any appetizers but I had three different margaritas.  I had the house (nacho daddy), the pineapple mint and a blueberry margarita I saw on a previous review but was told wasn't available but they made one for me.  My favorite was the house margarita.  Their sweet and sour mix was quite good.  For dinner I had the not your average burger nachos.  They were very good.  I added sour cream, but it was the ground beef, bacon and lettuce mix on top that really did it for me.  My son had the filet fajitas.  He destroyed them.  My wife had the burrito.  It was ok, it was a burrito.  Nothing really stood out about it.  The restrooms were tidy and this place has a great YELP check in incentive.  We will be back."}
{"text":"JOVANNY!!!!! Can't say enough of how wonderful of a waiter he was and we couldn't of asked for better service!!! He was very helpful and made our first experience very enjoyable. Food portions are generous and out did what we ever expected. Highly , highly recommend coming here! A must when your in Vegas."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times so far, all have been great! First visit I got the BBQ pork burrito, super tasty and refreshing. Second time I got the Mexican Street Burger - again, awesome. This time I got the Supreme Tostada Nachos. Soooo good! I love that the menu has a pretty big variety of stuff, because I don't always want a typical burrito/etc you'd expect from a Mexican restaurant.   It was busy and the servers were busting their behinds and we were still in and out pretty quick. The servers are all so kind and cheery. I have an IndiCard so I use it whenever I go for the sweet discount (don't worry, the amount we save is usually what goes to the server for their tip - for example, our bill tonight for 2 sodas, Burger Nachos, Tostada Nachos, and a fried ice cream was only $21 with the IndiCard hookup, so we tipped $20. Win-win, right?)  We want to come back on a Wednesday for the Trivia Night with our friends soon. :) Thank you, Nacho Daddy!"}
{"text":"We came into eat last night and had 4 orders of Nachos. Ryan our server, and the rest of the staff exceeded any and all expectations. If you want some of the most yummiest nachos, look no further. :):):)"}
{"text":"So...this is now the second time that the hostess shorted my change by about $5. Hmmmm.....How common is that for cashiers in this area?? I always tip but i guess its not good enough. Very disappointing..."}
{"text":"Great nachos!! Rude staff.  Have been twice and tried the filet mignon nachos and the enchilada nachos. Both excellent. However staff both times has been rude, especially the host that is in the front."}
{"text":"Came for lunch sat at the bar with Anya! What a great bartender, very friendly and we had great service! Quest dip always my favorite and awesome Margaritas! For those with Indi cards great deals everyday! A must visit"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!  I'm not sure what to say...the food, my mango margarita with Hornito's Tequilla and our waitress all rocked!!"}
{"text":"Arienna was an awesome server! The good was excellent! Margaritas are great. Good deal when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Nachos were AMAZING!!!!! Highly recommend getting those and the margarita on the rocks! It's an unspeakable sin!"}
{"text":"I didn't realize this was a large chain restaurant. I was hoping for a small-ish nacho speciality shop. That being said the food and service were all average. We probably won't make it a priority to go back though."}
{"text":"Some of the best fajitas I've had. My wife and I shared the mixed (steak and shrimp) fajitas. Very tasty and fresh tasting. Also had the BBQ pork nachos. Very tasty, but really like an open face pulled pork sandwich with chips instead of bread. Not much cheese on there, which is what I think of when I think nachos. Still really good and filling.  Nice rustic western ambiance with an open feel. Service was very good. Hostess and waitress were helpful in navigating the menu.  House beers were mediocre, but they do have Dog Fish on tap.  We would go here again."}
{"text":"All i can say is that Jovanny gives white glove service. he's incredible, works so hard, and it so communicative and fast to help. super friendly too. makes me want to come back every time i'm in vegas."}
{"text":"Great food. Wish they had one in California. I really enjoyed the nachos. There was so much i wanted to try. Will be going back the next time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"So good! Thai chicken nachos were amazing! Really unique and hit the spot. Huge portions good for 2 people. Hubs loves the HH potato chip nachos. Not my fav but if you like potato chips is a winner."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place on a recent trip to Vegas, but my parents had gone on the night before I arrived. So instead I just ordered a breakfast burrito to go one morning for second breakfast. The burrito was incredibly large and came with a side of chips and salsa which was a nice touch. But it took almost 20 minutes to prepare despite the restaurant being almost completely empty. And without the addition of the salsa from the side of chips and salsa, the burrito itself was a little bit bland. It is a nice large space, with plenty of TVs for watching sports, and nice bar area. I could see this as a casual snack or dinner location and they have very reasonable price points compared to many restaurants on the strip nearby."}
{"text":"Went to Nacho Daddy for the first time yesterday because my partner looked up the menu online and saw that they were vegan friendly. So needless to say, we were excited! Place is a lot bigger than I expected, it looks small from the outside. But I enjoyed the ambiance. We ordered the vegan nachos and the vegan chicken quesadilla and both were amazing! Very filling and made with a homemade vegan queso, it almost tasted like the real thing! And apparently it was Vegan Monday so we also got a free beer! It was a little early to be drinking, but hey it was free! We will definitely be back. Oh, and they also have a photobooth! Not sure how much it costs but that was pretty fun to see!"}
{"text":"Queso is to die for! House margarita is better than most. Good atmosphere, great prices! Staff is friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Came in expecting to munch on some nachos and enjoy some margaritas and we got much more. Definitely enjoyed our food and drinks but Jovanny R. Was an amazing server! Greeted us right away and even joked around with us! Checked on us several times and made sure we had everything throughout our dinner. That's how all servers should be! I'd definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas unfortunately.  I live in NYC and am very picky about the foods.  Nacho Daddy has impressed me a lot!  It's a great place and awesome waitresses/staff.  I'd give 5 stars! Looking forward to going there next time when I go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"We spent one week in Las Vegas in July, and man does it get hot! Nachos are my all time favorite food, and Nacho Daddy delivered on two out of three occasions. The first two visits were perfect and would receive five stars! From the server to the food quality it was A plus, but then we returned on a Tuesday morning, and all was not right with the world. First- tables were dirty and not bussed. There seemed to be only one waitress and she seemed overwhelmed. The worst thing was when we asked for the Supreme Nachos and were told there was no beef?!!! I should back this review down to two stars, but the first two visits really were perfect. The four cheese nachos and the nacho supreme would bring us back when we return to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the nachos here. We split between two people. Good prices for being just off the main Strip"}
{"text":"Excellent!! Free margarita with yelp! We upgraded to the blackberry, it was great. The tostadas supreme and Thai chicken rice bowl were delicious! Seriously come here, enjoy a drink and sit outside. From the hostess, to the server, and everyone in between-great friendly service! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Our server Aly was really nice. Aly helped us by guiding us through the menu and  welcoming us to nacho daddy's. It was a great experience"}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant we ate at during our visit in Las Vegas. The food was great although I liked the ground beef enchiladas over the chicken enchiladas. Our waiter was cool and even suggested some cool places to check out during our trip."}
{"text":"Came with a giant group and had the best time. DJ was the best server over here. Super accomadating and really fun! Cool dude"}
{"text":"Jacob was cool, food was great, better than Javiers. That's really all you need to know."}
{"text":"This place was awesome and started my trip off in Vegas wonderful. The thing that impressed me most with the team work in the place, our server Ryan was one of the best servers I've ever had and I'm in the industry ;he was very attentive and communication was awesome .He made sure we had everything we needed, checked on us often, and had a great personality.  We never lacked anything and I watched as he took care of several other tables and very missing a beat, he was the shit, simply said! The entire team worked together including the great friendly hosts, and expediter who was running food, also we had a chance to meet the manager Brian, who was truly the leader of the tribe who led by example bussing tables. I also met another manager  I can't remember her name, sorry but a cute dark haired female. The place was extremely busy and they didn't miss a beat, it was truly worth the wait. The food was awesome also, it was fresh tasting, came out hot and great portions. This was a great place to start a trip in Vegas the ambience was upbeat they had awesome music for all tastes and the restaurant was clean. I plan on visiting one more time before I leave Vegas, they made just that much of an impression with all the places that are available to eat!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but it's usually pretty packed, and wait staff has been rude every time I've gone there. Combined with the fact that this place is on the expensive side, you're much better off going to La Comida."}
{"text":"This place is great! The service & food was delicious. Be sure to sit in AJ's section, he's the man!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service went there yesterday for dinner took them one hour to bring check no one even asked once for refills for drinks nvr going back to this place"}
{"text":"We came here around 10am and were quickly greeted and sat on the patio.  Our server Miss Ari was so sweet and accommodating and the food was exceptional! They have so many options for vegans/gf like myself, I felt like I actually had a whole menu to choose from! We weren't rushed and loved the whole atmosphere. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Met all of our expectations. Went because it was highly rated and reviewed on here. Had the filet mignon nachos and they were delicious. I've never had anything like it and will be craving more later. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"My first time to Nacho Daddy, loved it! Not super easy to find, went through the mall but entrance is actually outside.  I had the chicken fajita my girlfriend had the vegan \"chicken \" chimichanga and loved it.   We topped it off by having a vegan chocolate cake with raspberry topping. Don't let the word vegan scare you off, it was all about the chocolate.    BTW loved our server DJ!"}
{"text":"The nachos here are to die for. They are loaded with good stuff. I had the filet ones and could not finish them."}
{"text":"Vegan Tex-Mex on The Strip? Yesss! Not a huge fan of the flavor of the vegan queso but the nachos are overall pretty good. The vegan chick'n fajita/taco bowl was tasty with a top notch chicken substitute. Can't go wrong with a margarita on the side, especially when it's free with Yelp check-in and an entree purchase. Would return to try the other vegan dishes!"}
{"text":"Awesome Nacho place! great kids menu as well . Also happy to meet Richard as great and handsome server here:)  hope everyone enjoy this place."}
{"text":"This was a fun lunch we stopped in for a casual experience that looked fun.  Got some great nachos and fajitas, with some tequila of course, haha. I enjoyed it and would recommend; no issues, but it was a more causal spot."}
{"text":"I love nachos and this place didn't disappoint. Great nachos, drinks, food, and atmosphere. Pricing is Vegas pricing."}
{"text":"Based on other reviews I had really high hopes but ended up being disappointed.  The atmosphere is great and the staff was very friendly and provided good service.  Unfortunately, the food was below average and over priced."}
{"text":"In town visiting from NC. Staying half way down the block at the Elara.  My friend and I had to wait about 5 minutes for a seat.  It did not appear to be as busy as the night before (Saturday) despite heavy foot traffic associated with evening marathon race. Couple came in after us and decided to take table closer to bar.  After finally being seated in a booth it was at least another five minutes before I got up to inquire as to whether or not  someone was assigned that station. (Meanwhile employees were walking back and forth to kitchen) and no one ever acknowledged us. Friend and I finally decided to leave and walk back to eat at one of the places inside the mall.  Nacho Daddy.....definitely not."}
{"text":"Good sized portions. Their Thai nachos are fantastic and absolutely recommended if you like to try something different. Margaritas are pretty good too"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, just what we were looking for.  Just got into town, we wanted Nachos and margaritas.  John, our server, did a great job steering us to the spicy Pina margarita.  Just spicy enough to feel a kick, but not burn your lips off.  Got the tostada supreme nachos with no sour cream, fantastic. Then topped it off with fried ice cream (haven't had this in years), served on a bed of Sopapia nachos and it was delicious. Just use the cinnamon fried nachos to scoop the ice cream. Yum."}
{"text":"Did not disappoint!!! I'm always suspicious of highly rated restaurants, but this place is amazing. Great food, excellent service, great location. We will be back. Cassandra is an excellent bartender."}
{"text":"love this place.  we showed up with a party 30+ and ryan took great care of us!!  she and chris were amazing.  patient, hilarious, friendly and not annoyed with our huge group and special requests.  the beer is great, the food is insane, everything was perfection.  so good i considered going twice in our trip to vegas.  can't wait to go back and get some bbq chicken nachos and the daddy hefe beer.  highly recommended.  special thanks to ryan and chris!!!"}

{"text":"Came here for the scorpion shots. 10 pm on Saturday night not during peak season - it was relatively quiet. Despite this, service was kind of slow. Food was ok. There is a HUGE screen to watch a game on.   So, scorpion shot. Expensive for a shot, but they know why you're getting it. You get to keep the shotglass. Yes, I ate my scorpion. Swallowed the first one and when my buddy refused to eat us, chewed the second. Tasted kind of crunchy and herbally, not my favorite, but not disgusting. They are small anyway.  The inconsistent service and the lackluster food though makes it unlikely I will return."}
{"text":"OH YEAHHHHHH  Very many vegan options.. in their own section of the menu.. i ordered through Uber eats. I had the vegan spicy burrito and it was so freaking goood. The marinated chicken was exceptional. The burrito had the best combination of stuff. I also had a side of guacamole and queso with my chips.  The burrito was a 10/10 Queso was a 7/10 Guacamole was a 6.5/10"}
{"text":"This was a great find! Lots of options, ordered the queso, it was delicious!! Also had a chicken taco that was very good. Great service, we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere at this restaurant! We sat outside on the sidewalk which was lovely. We ordered the skinny dip for an appetizer, which is queso and tortilla chips. Absolutely fabulous! We also ordered the avocado street tacos for our entrée. Outstanding! It was just the right amount of food. I love the fact that they have a vegan section on their menu. There are lots of vegan choices and we thoroughly enjoyed our food."}
{"text":"GREAT place for chips & queso! This has become one of my favorite places to go to  whenever I am in Las Vegas. It is an easy walk across the street from the Cosmopolitan where we were staying."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! I absolutely loved this place. Their location on the strip was right in the center so it was convenient getting there. And their staff were all incredible!   The menu is so diverse and tasty I had nothing to complain about. We ordered off their vegetarian menu the spicy burrito which was amazing (and very spicy). We also got their bottomless chips and salsa which was also great.   Our waiter Edward was the best! Super sweet and helpful he made our experience one to remember. We will definitely be coming back there! Thank you so much for the amazing food and service you guys are the best! Definitely deserve five stars!!"}
{"text":"Really good service from Michael. Enjoyed the food drinks and atmosphere. Kids liked the set up and food as well which is always a bonus."}
{"text":"Spending election night having a great time at Nacho Daddy's where the best Mex food in Vegas is! Plus ask for Kiel, best server in Nevada!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for happy hour.  Many of great choices for happy hour.  We had sloppy Jose nachos and not your average burger nachos. Plus the grilled Mexican corn was good too."}
{"text":"Cerah was such a great bartender and server! She was so helpful and friendly and made our experience there one of a kind! Definitely recommend visiting!"}
{"text":"This was our first time coming here. I've driven by but never had a chance to check it out till today. One of my best friend from out of town wanted to get together for dinner so we decided to check it out. Our waiter Alex was very funny and engaging. Our food was great and came our fairly quickly. The portions are huge. The apple pie nachos were delicious. Everything was great. I would definitely recommend this place. Great experience."}
{"text":"Great hidden place off of Planet Hollywood...entry is off Harmon Ave. Amanda was great and very attentive. My husband and I split the Fiesta Nachos and it was a perfect lunch. I am not big on crazy stuff in nachos, but everything was diced, so it was good for even picky eater like me. The jalapeños had a surprise kick to them. Will definitely come back on next Vegas visit!"}
{"text":"My family and I had an awesome experience all thanks to Lee! Lee was extremely accommodating to our party of 5.   This is a great place to enjoy nachos and some margaritas. Our server Lee was awesome and honored our coupons for free house margaritas with a purchase of an entree.   He went above and beyond assuring we were comfortable and well taken care of. He even enough our table 2 sets of warm tortilla chips and salsa.   Happy hour all day on Sundays is a must try!"}
{"text":"Not sure why the rating is so high, this is expensive taco Bell quality food, at best.  Our service left alot to be desired.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"GREATEST NACHOS EVER!!!  Margaritas are tasty and so is all the salsas!   The service could have been a little better, but the food made up for it!!   If I'm ever back in Vegas i WILL go back!!!"}
{"text":"Kayla gave us great customer service she made my experience extra and enjoyable... the food was so so good, nachos cheese and jalapeño was simple but had a unforgettable taste definitely coming back before I leave vegas !!!"}
{"text":"We tried Nacho Daddy today for the first time and I am disappointed! The server Alex was the best thing about this place! The hostess was less than friendly and the food was mediocre. We order the Vegas Knight Nachos and they were not all that.. The Naked Wings were ok and the chicken quesadilla tasted like something from Taco Bell. The had Alex working 8 tables by himself and he wasn't able to double back and offer us refills on our drinks because he didn't have time..Not his fault at all..Probably understaffed and trying to save money..I do not recommend this place and most likely we will not be back."}
{"text":"Needed a quick and filling meal after flying in early, hiking at red rocks canyon and visiting Hoover dam. Nacho Daddy delivered! Thanks to yelp, I got a free margarita which came in a mason jar and was solid. We ordered the Golden Knights nachos which easily fed my wife and me. They came out quickly too. For each purchase of that entree $1 is donated to charity. The fried ice cream with chocolate and raspberry sauces for dessert was tasty. All in all, a good start to our time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Thai chicken nachos delicious  Also if you check in with Yelp you get a free margarita. But honestly you don't need a free margarita to enjoy yourself.  Only negative, location  Don't get discouraged just keep walking it's around the bend next to Buffalo Wild Wings"}
{"text":"Giovanny was the most accommodating server ever! Super friendly, would definitely come again if this is what customer service is like here! 5 stars for me. Drinks and food were BOMB.   Loved how he connected with us, his customers, by relating to us as we are from Orange County as well. Nothing more comforting than having something in common with your server and feeling welcomed on another level."}
{"text":"Sunday Funday Checked in for the free Margaritas! Immediately got a warning about multiple reviews that may have been connected with the same server but I had to try it myself. 3 stars for the food but none for the service and cleanliness of this place. We ordered the fiesta nachos ( delicious but not enough chips ), filet mignon street tacos ( overpriced for these 3 mini tacos but again delicious ). Margaritas were strong and served quickly. No stars for the service. It took about 20min just to receive our waters which we asked 3 different servers from. The glasses were filthy and still had someone's lipstick on it. Server apologized and gave another water, offered a free margarita but never came back."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas and heard this place was bomb. It was actually pretty good! I had the Thai bowl and some friends got the nachos and they were pretty tasty. Also, if you check in you get a free margarita so that was a plus!"}
{"text":"Great Experience. Big Tvs. They play old school music videos which was awesome to see on a TV while games are going on. went back to back days this weekend. Spinach Chips and shrimp nachos are great. Lobster and Crab Nachos not so much. could be better with a sauce instead of the mango Pico de Gallo but just my opinion. Good environment. Will come back again to try breakfast menu."}
{"text":"I wanted to give a great review. I am vegan, so I can say the food is delicious. But I checked in on yelp and got the free margarita. It was so sweet, I couldn't drink it. I told my waitress and she brought me another one which was worse than the first. I told her it was sweeter than the first and her response was \"at least it was free\" and didn't offer to help me get a margarita that was correct.  Not the right response in my book, especially for a place giving a free margarita to check into yelp... which is a place for reviews.  Vegan food=good"}
{"text":"Food was good, a bit generic for Tex mex, but tasty all the same. The drinks were top notch. Service was good even though a bit slow. I wasn't a huge fan of the ambience and the blaring 80s/90s music, but overall worth a stop if you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Was waiting for table. Noone came. Everyone ignore us. Lights were dimmed. Place look like crap."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would. We gave them a second chance and they screwed it up yet again. We got there at 7:04 and after 20 minutes didn't even have our chips and salsa while tables that were seated after us were getting their food. When we complained as we were leaving, the manager couldn't even be bothered to come out and apologize. Nacho Daddy has lost my business for good."}
{"text":"Had the Crab & lobster nachos. They were okay but next time, I would prefer to get the steak nachos instead. The atmosphere was cool. Decent customer service. I visited the location inside Planet Hollywood Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Omg this place was on point! We had the Vegan chickn quesadillas and the vegan chickn nachos. I was very impressed with the vegan cheese and sour cream! The happy hour margarita wasnt bad either! Melanie T Houston Tx"}
{"text":"Open late at night! Great for large parties! They just needed more staff when we went at 1am."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas! Very close to the strip, so great location, and the food is bomb. We got the bottomless chips and salsa -- definitely worth it! They come out quickly, salsa is good, chips are perfectly salted, so overall great start to the meal. I also ordered the shrimp and steak fajitas, which were good, but cooked in tequila. It made for a great show, but the tequila aftertaste was not something I enjoyed. The rice and beans were good and it came with guac!!! The fries were some of the best I've ever had. Nachos were also delicious, but I was sharing so I only got a few. Service was also good - quick and a good amount of attentive."}
{"text":"We enjoyed reasonably priced nachos and drinks! Would return."}
{"text":"Good nachos, a little bit on the pricey side for nachos. Good nachos tho. They staff was a little rude but in the end we got what we came for.   We all checked in for the free house margarita but they claimed they only saw 5/6 of the check ins. After we showed them that we all did it, we all got our drinks.   Other then that, good stuff here."}
{"text":"Nice bar and atmosphere. Sat at the bar to avoid the wait and the bartender was very friendly. Nachos were alright and drinks reasonably priced given that it's right on the strip"}
{"text":"at nacho daddy on w sahara for buy one get scarlett is the best bartender in town! love that gurl!!"}
{"text":"This is a must for anyone who loves nachos! I ordered the enchilada nachos with red sauce and they were hands down the best nachos that I have ever had! They will definitely fill just about anyone up, I was stuffed after eating them! The classic margarita was excellent as well, and it had a good amount of tequila!"}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance.  Loved the drinks. Food was beyond amazing. Best salsa I've had in a long time"}
{"text":"I went to nacho daddy because a friend of mine is a server. First of all do your check in before you get there and order because they won't be able to remove your deal on the check.  I didn't have the best experience because I don't eat meat so I ordered nachos with extra beans. It didn't come with extra beans so I asked for extra beans again and by the time I got the bill I was charged twice for extra beans.  Also my strawberry margarita had no alcohol in it.  I know everybody says drinks are watered down or whatever but legitimately there was no alcohol in my margarita or my friends margarita. They were both pure syrups and sugar. I understand that they were busy but I also know that the bartender was brand new and she was new to bartending in general. Besides that my nachos were decent but my bill wasn't.  I just decided not to go back.  :/  what made me stay was the vibe and the music."}
{"text":"Cool ambience, Scarlett was on it, all in all a great experience for my first trip to the new Nacho Daddy!! Triple dip add refried beans to queso is a must :)"}
{"text":"We came in at 11:30pm on a Friday night n were seated right away...It wasn't too crowded but it took a long time for our food to come out...I like the horchata margarita n the white peach margarita...My friend got the spicy pina margarita but it had a weird earthy taste to it...The filet mignon nachos were good but a little too salty...My friends ordered the fish tacos n chicken sandwich n said they were good"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I dined here on our most recent trip to Las Vegas.  We had been drinking for quite sometime and I needed some sustenance.  This place had some great reviews so we decided to check it out.  It is located on the far South corner of the MGM Grand.  Location is kind of weird.  I thought we were going to end up at the Tropicana.  We had to go out of the building to enter.  We arrived right as Happy Hour was getting started and they had some very reasonable prices for food anywhere, but Happy Hour made it an even better deal. They have a scorpion tank when you enter, which freaked me out, but the man thought it was cool.  Because we were there early, it was not loud or crowded, but I imagine if it were a different time of day it could be very loud and very crowded and it is a good size restaurant with lots of wide open space.   I checked in on Yelp and got a free house margarita.  The man ordered a house margarita on Happy Hour.  Margarita was solid for a house/happy hour special.   You do have to pay for the chips and salsa, but they are minimally priced and unlimited.  They have both a hot and mild sauce that they will bring to you.  They were good.   For food we ordered the pork tacos which I really loved.  The man liked them less so.  It isn't that he didn't like them, but he likes, \"American tacos\" with their hard shells, lettuce, tomato and sour cream .  These were pork tacos with hot sauce and queso fresca  He didn't like the soft flour tortilla (It's more authentic!).  He didn't like that the hot sauce was chilled and the pork was hot.  Essentially, everything I loved about it, he didn't care for.  I thought the sizzling hot pork with the chilled hot sauce was a gorgeous blend of hot and cold.  The queso fresca was awesome and they had limes that you could squeeze over the tacos to add that bit of acidity. We apparently just have very different tastes in tacos.   I really enjoyed the food here.  If you want authentic, hole in the wall Taqueria,  go to Tacos El Gordo, but if you want good food in a casual atmosphere with reasonable prices then this a solid bet.  I would come back."}
{"text":"Oh my VEGAN GOODNESS!!! I ate here twice while visiting Vegas in December. I had the loaded vegan nachos the first time and the vegan quesadilla the second time. Absolutely delicious both times and this will be a regular stop anytime I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great breakfast/brunch. Relaxed atmosphere and wonderful food. Would definitely come back!  Hueovos rancheros and veggie omelet were the best!"}
{"text":"Kinda Basic.....the staff was nice, food was just okay, the decor is cool but the vibes were weird. Not a place I'd seek out or recommend necessarily but it's not horrible, although the bathrooms were disgusting!!!! Skip the queso. It was cold, bland & hard. Margarita was good!"}
{"text":"DJ was an awesome server, super friendly and helpful. He made sure we had everything we needed during our meal.  The food was excellent, such a great spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was really good but on the check they charged me twice three dollars for beans. Also the bartender was very slow we are already had our meals before we had any drinks. We weren't in a hurry otherwise this would be a problem. It was Cinco de Mayo so I understand that it might be extra busy but we went early and there was only three or four other tables eating. There was a charity event going on outside and mariachis inside. Overall I would come back I just wouldn't order the nachos next time. Maybe no drinks either because my friend asked for an Irish mule and got vodka and Jamison w/ no lime. Lol"}
{"text":"Jovanny was our server and was so helpful and had amazing customer service! Food was great but having an amazing sever always helps the experience. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Best service ever. Ari, the best waitress on the strip. Great breakfast. Had the steak omelette twice both times perfect. Recommend Nacho Daddy and request Ari as your server. Big portions for reasonable prices."}
{"text":"VEGAN WARNING--perhaps triple check your food--find pictures on yelp and compare it to what you get.    * if you order vegan, keep the order simple and do not distract the wait staff with any witty repartee or compliments while ordering.  you can always joke around AFTER the correct order comes in * when you get your dish, compare it to pics on yelp of vegan chicken, cheese, etc. if it looks TOO good to be true,... it just may be real chicken.  yes, i had an experience ordering the well reputed vegan chicken quesadilla (nachos also get a great rep on yelp). even asking a waiter if my order looked like real meat because the cheese/meat looked so amazing. he assured me it was the vegan version; then, a few bites later he warned me it was actually real chicken. (it was a mistake--probably in the ordering process.  they replaced it.  offered a a drink to apologize.  no management came by at the time, but the training manager at nacho daddy read my review and wrote me personally to get more details of the incident--so they could avoid future problems.  thank you, taylor."}
{"text":"Server (Leo) was amazing! Let us know about the check in offer and did a great job at seating us fast even without a host. Fast service."}
{"text":"My daughter and I came here after a hard day of work. We were planning on coming here all day and I was really excited for some nachos and a margarita. As soon as we entered we were seated. The restaurant was more than half empty. We let the hostess know that we needed to run to the restroom to wash our hands. A few minutes later we were back. We sat and selected our food and drink, pushed our menus away and waited. We would wait another 15 minutes. About 10 minutes in, two men were seated at the table next to us. They we're greeted within 30 seconds, given cocktail napkins, and their drink order taken. At no point in time did anyone who was employed by Nacho Daddy approach to our table. As I indicated earlier, we left after 15 minutes of no service. We went to Hussong's in Boca Park, where we were seated and had placed an order for drinks and food in 10 minutes. My only other experience with this location of Nacho Daddy was when my daughter and I came here and ate, the service was good, until we needed a check. We waited a half hour before we even saw someone to flag down. During that visit some ppl were having a party in the restaurant, they were so loud that we had to yell across the table at each other if we wanted to conversate. We quickly gave up."}
{"text":"Surprisingly for LV, this is a local place. Fantastic happy hour from 3-6 Mon-Fri with $5 margaritas and app specials. We were staying at Marriott Vacation Villas and returned for dinner with a Marriott discount. Some great healthy salad and vegan options in addition to good U.S. Style Mex. loved the bartender Scarlett during 1st happy hour visit. Dinner service 2nd visit a little slow. For price point and taste, great option."}
{"text":"Wow. First time here from California. Great food at awesome prices. Sat at the bar & our bartender/server Chase was friendly and super helpful. Very extensive vegan options to choose from. I highly recommend this place. Will be coming back here soon."}
{"text":"Wow the food is soo delish,,,,  after a terrible day with a nail infection this is exactly what I needed  Highly recommend  Also...  avoid Kyou ...  I am visiting from SD and I have a terrible nail infection from salon Kyou  But the nacho daddy made me feel sooo much better"}
{"text":"The sloppy joe nachos. Not too bad. The daddy margarita was good. We will be back to try more on the tasty looking menu."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Love the atmosphere! Love the food! My husband & I had eloped to the Grand Canyon & stopped in for lunch. Came back the next night for food & celebratory shots as husband & wife. Love this place! Food was amazing. & the scorpion shots? A must experience. :) We will be back! For sure!"}
{"text":"Love this location. Everyone here is great! Manager peter is really cool, bartender arnold makes great drinks and is really nice and server ryan is awesome! The vegan, gluten free nachos are fabulous! Fun vibe on the strip and open late!!!"}
{"text":"Great tasting gluten free, vegan nachos!  Nice, friendly staff and a nice ambiance with the fireplace."}
{"text":"Located in the former Firefly restaurant this place offers a bit more than nachos. We arrived during happy hour and i must admit their house margarita is amazing! I wish they offered a smaller portion of their nachos during happy hour sometimes you dont want a massive mound of food at $10.95 a plate. I ordered the bbq chix nachos which my friend warned me not to order because they are a bit robust. They arrived and she was not wrong - there was too much going on on the plate. The bbq sauce was overpowering and salty, the cheese sauce got lost under everything and just coated your mouth, the onion strings were salty and the chicken was salty. I suppose it came out as it should have but i make these at home minus onion strings and never get this kind of intense flavor. I wouldn't order them again. My friend ordered the hamburger nachos which were an odd flavor combination but good. My other friend ordered the fish and chips which tasted of old smelly fish. We blame him for ordering that in a restaurant that serves nachos, but not sure why thats even on the menu.   The service was great, quick and friendly. They have a pretty varied menu to choose from if youre not a fan of nachos. I love nachos but will stick to my real Mexican restaurants to satisfy my appetite."}
{"text":"Love the place and the sassitude of the staff. I DO however wish they would bring back the pomegranate margaritas! I came back and brought a friend specifically for them! Bring them back!! Please!"}
{"text":"Late night meal ... absolutely perfect! Our waiter, Ryan, was engaged with us from the beginning. All of his suggestions were spot on ... even the shots with a scorpion in them. My family had a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and was served by Rebekah. She was excellent.  Quick service and good food and drinks. The tvs and music are also a plus. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food was good, service not so great.  The only time server came was to take order, drop off appetizer and leave check.  Loud atmosphere in eating area.  Probably won't go back, food a little pricey for the value."}
{"text":"My husband and I were there for Dinner! We had the supreme Nachos they were just the best, We also had the pork enchiladas and a house margarita. Lee was extremely helpful and made great recommendations. The customer service and food were great!"}
{"text":"WHOA JESUS THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!!!!! There's a whole vegan section on the menu and it's legit! The vegan queso is some of the best I've had and their chick'n nachos are super delish. One of my fellow diners said he liked the vegan chicken better than his real chicken. They even have a vegan chocolate cake which is fantastic. I want, no, I NEED a Nacho Daddy in Dallas!!"}
{"text":"This happy hour is amazing. The service is killer too. I like their tacos and sliders."}
{"text":"Bomb nachos! And Gabby was great!!!!!!!!!! She will definitely take care of you and make sure your party is well accommodated"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing. The quest dip is the best I've ever had. Their margs are very strong, use the free marg coupon! I highly recommend the bowls. Flight is also good."}
{"text":"I have eaten at 2 of their restaurants, several times. Food has always been good as has the service."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  My husband and I visited here while on our anniversary trip and we weren't disappointed. This was the first restaurant we ate at when we got off the plane and we were happy. We had 1 order of nachos and our waiter helped us customize how we wanted it. It was enough for the both of us and it was very tasty. We sat near the outside patio and enjoyed the fresh air.   The next night we ordered the naked hot wings and they were SUPER AMAZING! The sauce came on the side which was great bc the wings had a bold char grilled flavor which tasted great. It was like having two types of wings with fried which were also very tasty.   Overall the food was great with good quality ingredients and taste. Everything was fresh!"}
{"text":"Are you a fan of scorpions? Not the rock group, the creepy crawly creatures that have claws and a tail that stings its prey before devouring it. I'm a fan of scorpions but I never considered eating them. I have eaten grasshoppers and crickets but never scorpions. They have the scorpion shot for ~$20, depending on type of tequila you select. I ordered up one for me and the bartender. They are able to drink 2 a shift. Just chew the little creature first and then shoot the tequila. Don't worry the stinger is removed. Little chewy but nothing a true yelper couldn't handle.   Since it was Tuesday they had a great Tacos Tuesday deal. Tacos were dirt cheap and full of meat. They were probably some of the meatiest tacos ever. You could easily share an order or just eat the meat. The tacos don't come with too many extras, so they're a little plain. We also ordered the filet mignon nachos. Those things were bomb! Huge chunks of meat as well.    Service was excellent. Our bartender was very entertaining and knowledgeable about all the dishes and drinks. We also scored a house margarita courtesy of the yelp check in offer. I was a bit skeptical at first because the yelp page had a consumer alert warning for multiple positive reviews from same IP address but it was Tuesday and I wanted tacos.   I wouldn't bring the kiddos here. Cool spot to have date night or hang with some friends. Happy eating/drinking!"}
{"text":"Good food and amazing service!! Our waitress was the best! She made the experience just wonderful. It was our first place to eat landing in Vegas and it couldn't had been better. Their margaritas were delicious my favorite was the spicy cucumber while my bf like the special house one."}
{"text":"The food was great and I really liked the music selection. It was my first time and I'll be back next time I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome nachos. Service was fast and polite. The bottomless chips were amazing. I had American Tacos and they were delicious. All 8 of us got something different and not a single negative comment. Even our non Mexican food eater got really decent burger. We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"We went to this Nacho Daddy on Sahara on a Sunday for lunch. Great atmosphere and great customer service. Wife and I ordered the moco loco nacho and the Asian style nachos, both were awesome. Had great flavor. I ordered the wings, that was the only mistake I did. It was good but didn't go with the nachos we were eating. The nachos were a little sweet, but the wings were spicy. Not a good mix. Overall, we were really satisfied with our food and visit. Will definitely go again. Wife just bought a Groupon for it while I was writing this review."}
{"text":"My wife and I are staying at the Aria on the strip. 1st day here we had to only eat at Subway because there is no vegan restaurants or options. Found this place on Happy Cow and it says off the strip. It's like 40' off the strip and by far the best vegan quesadillas the I've have ever had vegan or non vegan. Got the deep fried advacodo street tacos. Who would have thought to bread and fry those? Who ever did is a genius!!!!! Multiple options for vegans, an entire section just for vegan. Must go if in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Nacho Daddy in Hendersen and had a pleasant experience, so I was excited that a Nacho Daddy opened on my side of town.   Chips and salsa was good, but the experience ends there. My husband wanted a combo plate, but the menu was lacking in traditional combo plates like you see at most Mexican food joints. He decided to order off the a la carte menu, but it didn't come with all the sides or fideo soup like other restaurants do. I ordered the chicken fajitas which were bland and nothing memorable.  The service was extremely slow and we were asking other servers for help when we could not find ours. While their nachos look interesting, I probably won't be back. At lease at this location."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a awesome lunch on our last day in Vegas.  Our waitress Arieanna was absolutely amazing.  First off the temp was really warm and she immediately fixed it for us.  Then she took the time to recommend what margarita to pick.  She even went and got a sample for us (we decided on the blood orange margarita and it was fantastic).  Then we wanted to split a nacho and she was super helpful in explaining all the menu items.  We decided on the BBQ chicken nachos and the pulled pork chimichanga and let me say she was on point with her recommendations.  I highly recommend this restaurant and you will be extra lucky if Arieanna is your waitress."}
{"text":"This food is horrible. Save your money and eat taco bell. Canned refried beans horrible flavorless rice. Hardly any sauce on the enchiladas.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Great food! Great atmosphere. Johnny was friendly and entertaining to our table. Excellent service."}
{"text":"As soon I got to Las Vegas, my Lyft driver recommended that I give Nacho Daddy a chance. I'm so glad I received that recommendation. I got the cajun shrimp nachos and the Daddy's Margarita?! Rebecka was my bartender and waitress. Those nachos were filling and delicious! I've never had shrimp on nachos before but I'm glad I went for something new. The daddy margarita? did not disappoint? either. The food, drinks, and service are why I give Nacho Daddy 5 stars!"}
{"text":"What do you call a shitty restaurant and someone whose not your father. Yup you guessed correctly, this restaurant. Its not a bad restaurant... its just bad compared to whats around. Its authenticity and taste is mediocre at best. The atmosphere is nice, and the servers were nice but the food left nothing nothing to wonder, because it had no flavor.   heard of seasoning?"}
{"text":"Meh...$20 nachos are good, but...they're $20 for a fairly inexpensive dish. Came with free margaritas with the check in though, so not a huge issue.   Our only issue was the server. He was actually super nice but seemed more interested in himself than us; I asked for a soda water and he responded that he doesn't like soda water, went ahead and served me flat water anyway. He didn't write anything down, so when I changed my mind on salad dressing, he went ahead and brought the one I originally asked about, and when our bill came he went ahead and charged us for the margaritas despite both of us checking in for the free ones.  I understand everyone has a bad day, but I mean, did he have to mess up *everything* we requested? It's all good though, because he was having fun which means we werent upset. We had fun with it overall, and weren't upset enough to bring it up to him.   Otherwise, atmosphere was fun and food was tasty."}
{"text":"Despite the name, the nachos didn't lure us to the place, the free house margarita with check in did that.  Note, this review is not biased because of that, however I should note that I went here twice within a few days and the free house margarita was honored both times.  The second time was with a group of 10, and we easily had $100 of strong and good margaritas on the house.  Our servers were Ryan and Judy (across two visits), and they were both extremely friendly, attentive, and had very poignant recommendations.  I followed Judy's recommendation to get the shrimp and steak fajitas and was extremely pleased.  A very good spread of toppings, a generous serving of meat and choice of flour or corn tortillas.  We ordered bottomless chips and salsa for the table, and there was never a dry bowl or empty basket for our 10 person party.  We never had to ask for more chips or salsa, it just kept coming.  As far as I know, everyone enjoyed their meal.  This place is legit.  Come for the free margarita, and stay for the excellent service and food.  I was also impressed by their selection of vegetarian and vegan options, even though I'm a carnivore to the bone."}
{"text":"All Nacho Daddy's are the same. I live super close to this one. I really like their ceviche but things like their queso, not so much. Service is hit and miss."}
{"text":"Ryan our waitress was excellent! I love the fact that they had a vegan menu! The loaded vegan nachos was bomb! We also did the beer battered avocado street tacos, um.. hell yes! We also got the michelada and the margarita. I could have probably have skipped the michelada, but I have an unusually high expectation for those, so I don't even take that into consideration when I am reviewing a place. Overall this is going to be a must visit every time I visit Vegas! Great job on the decor and location for this place as well!"}
{"text":"Had never been to Nacho Daddy before, and I was not disappointed! AMAZING food!! Tuesday, our server, was awesome and super nice!! Thank you for the great service and outstanding nachos!! Will definitely be back!!   Update! Place is still awesome!! Laekyn was amazing! Hi Laekyn!! You are awesome!"}
{"text":"While staying at the ELARA we stumbled across Nacho Daddy. This place plays 90's hit song music videos, great atmosphere and staff. Our server Taylor had a great personally and made our dinning experience that much better.   - Cali Burrito - 4 stars out of 5  - lobster nachos - 4 stars out of 5 - shrimp Nachos - 4 stars out of 5"}
{"text":"Food and service were great! Best margaritas in Vegas! Gio and Gabby were great and very helpful!"}
{"text":"Ryan was an awesome server. He made some great suggestions and gave us an overall amazing experience. The nachos are bomb too!"}
{"text":"Our server Jovanny really took care of us. He was enthusiastic and provided fast service. Definitely check in for the the free margarita. The tacos are on the pricier side but it's Vegas. The food was good. Nothing wrong with it but nothing special!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews on this location I was a bit skeptical. This was our first time eating here so I can't compare to the other locations. We had chimichangas as an app, I had the huevos rancheros and my boyfriend had the Fiesta nachos. Everything was delicious. Both the nachos and my entrée were generous portions. We each had a house Margherita and they were very good, and only 5$ each because it was happy hour. Our bill was just under 40$. Our server, Mikey, was great, very friendly and attentive. And he also honored our coupon even though they usually don't during happy hour. The atmosphere was very nice: they had 80s music videos that we were very entertained by but the music wasn't so loud where we had to yell to each other (think Yardhouse). I don't think it's fair that other reviews compare this to more authentic Mexican restaurants since I don't think it's the point of Nacho Daddy. Overall we really enjoyed it and will likely add this to our list of go-to places to eat."}
{"text":"WOW!  What a wonderful experience. Audre was our waitress and did a fabulous job making us familiar with the menu and making us feel nice. We shared Thai chichen nachos and sizzling shrimp tacos. Flavors were incredible.  Presentation full and colorful. Would definitely recommend to those looking for a truly creative and explosive taste. Coming back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Love this spot! Seriously the food is great and so were the staff members that helped us out! Danny and Arnold were great and had us laughing the whole time! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Good variety of menu choices. Good size portions. Servers we good and attentive. Steady flow while I was there for lunch."}
{"text":"Tonight being our last night in Vegas after a fun-filled weeks vacation, we decided to eat here after being indecisive on where to eat. I had the spicy shrimp nachos, and my wife had the Fiesta nachos. Everything was great, including the service provided to us by our waitress Ryan. She was excellent and made sure we had everything we needed, and her recommendations were on point, from the nachos to the drinks. If you're in town, make sure to get some awesome nachos."}
{"text":"Drinks-bomb. Nachos-bomb. Our server DJ- super cool, personable and made us feel at home! Would definitely recommend and come back and ask for DJ!!!(:"}
{"text":"Wow! The food here was awesome! Had the Baja Seafood Combo and was not disappointed. It was delicious, and the fish, lobster, and crab were cooked perfectly. The white peach margarita was good as well but definitely sweet. I would go back and try more menu options again without a doubt."}
{"text":"ad an amazing time! The bartender Booker aka (Daddy Nacho) lol he had us laughing the entire night. Honestly best bartender I have had in Vegas so far ...I will definitelybe back.. #ScorpionShot"}
{"text":"Nachos are terrific. Probably the best anywhere. The burritos were almost all rice; very disappointing. They need to fix that. Service was below average. The waitress was like a robot and seemed tweaked when I broke out the yelp free margarita.  Despite the service and average burrito, I would go back for the nachos and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place!   Margarita with the check in is very good. Atmosphere is great for a Saturday, Sunday hangout or happy hour nachos!   Vegan Options Did I say the nachos are awesome, especially with the fillet in top! More TV screens than you could ask for~great for watching the game!  Tried the Angry Balls Drink...don't like beer a lotbut this was amazing!  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here weekly...at times daily LOL. The customer service is amazing! Zack, Gabe, Jazmine and Jonnie have been remarkable! Your service is appreciated! Food is good, beer is cold and we will continue to call this our local go to spot."}
{"text":"Had to get some nachos if we was gonna come here. Super cute waiter, DJ, served our group of 18ish ppl and did it with grace and swag. Got the lobster nachos for $23 and was able to share with another person. Worth. Every. Dollar. No chip was left dry indeed :) Thank you DJ for being so patient and sweet !!!"}
{"text":"Good food  , great service. Big portions and we enjoyed our meal . I would recommend this place and would come here again . Thanks for your great meal on My Birthday ."}
{"text":"Food is awesome and has a great friendly atmosphere. Love all the vegan options! Also a good spot to catch VGK games."}
{"text":"Had a good time at this restaurant they definitely have a good vibe going on I ordered the grilled wings they were  so good a friend got the enchilada nachos and another friend got chicken nachos both were delicious chicken nachos were better in my opinion servers were really friendly"}
{"text":"Love it here. Walk in a great by a helpful hostess who brought us in. Our server Huck was amazing super friendly and funny. Sings all the jams they play in the restaurant. Food was good and got a free margarita on check in. I guess Vegas is lucky for me after all"}
{"text":"Got the vegan loaded nachos and added the vegan chicken and they were amazing. Had to have my boyfriend try it first because I couldn't believe it was all vegan. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Glad we finally had a chance to try this place while in Vegas this weekend. Great place to grab some late night food. I opted for the vegan chicken nachos and my husband ordered the vegan chicken chimichanga. They were both good without the vegan chicken. This place was a life savior, as we didn't have many vegan options to choose from at 2am. Oh and their vegan chocolate cake was the best we've had yet! It was rich and not dry at all."}
{"text":"Great vegan options. I went for the nachos and they were amazing. margaritas are good but strong so watch out!"}
{"text":"Never going back.  Terrible tasting food and the service, No wonder it is no longer in business on Eastern Ave here in Las Vegas.  You were doomed from the get go.  Not your kind of Nachos."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times and it's always delicious and fresh food. Tonight we came in and finally noticed the early close time of 10pm. Never saw that before at this location. Being that it was already 9:55, we decided not to bother them with a full food order. The wife was visibly getting hangry and they offered us chips and salsa on the house to go with the drinks I wasn't about to leave without having. So our late night was saved with booze and chips, per the usual. Friendly and generous staff always. If they were open til midnight we'd be here much more often!"}
{"text":"My go to for postmates. Their packaging is great and portions are huge. I get the vegan fajitas and am never disappointed. Have tried recreating the way they pre their Gardein chic'n but just can't get it right! Vegan chocolate cake tops it off. LOVE this vegan menu."}
{"text":"Cassandra was AMAZING!!! Go to her next time she'll hook you up.  I ordered the beef enchiladas and it was really good. It's also reasonably priced. I would recommend this place for watching games and having a chill time."}
{"text":"Great margaritas! Can get a house one for free if you check in on Yelp! Tacos pretty good. Queso + beef REALLY good!"}
{"text":"Super Bomb place to checkout and you gotta get a scorpion shot!!!! Shannon you rock!!!"}
{"text":"Overall, the visit was amazing! My girlfriend and I shared the Salsa Verde Nachos, it fed us perfectly and tasted awesome. My Father got the Nacho Supreme I tried it and it was great, too my Aunt and Uncle got the Filet Mignon Nachos they were very good, also. We got the Queso appetizer and that was just as superb. The only issue I had was that the menu doesn't specify if the jalapeños are picked or fresh for each meal. So I suggest asking if you care. We will definitely be going back next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went to Nacho Daddy late night. Our waitress was very nice and sweet. She was very patient with us as we were doing more talking then looking at the menu. They have a variety of vegan options available which was a plus.  I went with the 4 cheese nachos and added black beans. They forgot to put the Queso on my nachos.. not sure how you forget that when question tends to be a big part of nachos. The waitress was nice and brought me queso on the side when I brought it to her attention.. Had to take off a star for the queso mistake as the navjos we're good, but the queso is my favorite part lol... I definitely suggest Nacho Daddy and will go again."}
{"text":"DJ our waiter was very professional and polite. He made sure to tell us the specials that were available. We enjoyed our time at Nacho Daddy and would eat here again. The food was affordable and tasty!!! Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Lauren K. was what made this experience so much better. She was really pleasant and helpful and made me feel at ease for my first time in Vegas. The nacho daddy experience is not the same without her here. Also I recommend the naked wings. Solid."}
{"text":"Nacho daddy was awesome!! Great drinks. Great atmosphere. Great Food! I didn't try the scorpion shots but its there for you!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you for the amazing service Alex and the scorpion shot king haha thank you for making a great experience!!!!"}
{"text":"If you want to try overpriced nachos, this is the place to do it."}
{"text":"We loved our meal at Nacho Daddy! We came for dinner and decided to sit at the bar - it was the best decision. The bartenders were working so hard to make sure everyone was taken care of. We were really impressed. I think Arnold was the name of the bartender who took care of us and he was stellar.   For the food we ordered the pulled pork nachos and the enchilada nachos. They were both delicious! Highly recommend checking this spot out if you're nearby."}
{"text":"This place absolutely sucks! Decided to give it another shot. Worst tacos ever. I'm going to keep typing because Yelp wants a longer review. This place is terrible."}
{"text":"Cassandra was our bartender and she was amazing! We got lobster, filet and pork tacos. She Hooked us up with a deal on it and gave us great recommendations. Would definitely come back next time I'm here!"}
{"text":"The enchilada nachos are awesome! Make sure to try half red and half green sauce...yum! :D"}
{"text":"Lots of different kinds of nachos you can get. The 2 we had were flavorful. You can also order extra nachos if you need them"}
{"text":"I was actually surprised bu this place, and to be fair, we may have just gotten lucky, as it seems like the kind of place you a 70/30 chance of getting it at the right time/group. We did, oddly enough it was a Friday night around 8pm and the place was pretty empty. A few tables here and there but you can tell this place was really designed to be packed and loud.  Glad it wasn't.  We started with margaritas, and I got the spicy cucumber margarita.  Boy oh boy.  I do love me some cucumber water, and I like spicy things, so those elements combined with a margarita and good booze?  Heck yea.  It was just ever so slightly too sweet, but I would get it again 10/10 times.  Just a little less sugar.  This place is obviously all about the nachos.  Though they have a TON of other options, lobster tacos, enchiladas, burritos, etc.  Obviously, I went for the nachos.  But with SO many to choose from how do you pick?  I could have gone for the classic guac and sour cream, or the extravagant loaded with this and that, but instead opted for Sloppy Joe nachos!  Yea.  Who doesn't love sloppy joes???  And nachos??  Right!?  So yea, this was a cool idea, and I had to try it.  Glad I did.  The sloppy joes were good, and the chips held up under the strain of seasoned and sauced ground beef, cheese, and the like.  I would be interested to try some other combos next time.  I think what I would do next time is have everyone order different nachos and then share them family style so you can try a bunch of them.  As it is the servings are large and I could not finish mine.  So a good ratio would be one nacho order per two people I think.  Everyone else complained that their drinks were all overly sweet and some chose not to finish drinking them at all.  Too bad.  The goblets they come serve in are large and about $14 each so seems a shame.  I would have asked for something else, or it to be remade less sweet.  But just a heads up if you tend to not like sweet drinks (I don't blame you).  I tried one and it was way too sweet.  I still stand by my spicy cucumber margarita as my top choice.  The service was good, and the place was nice.   Like I said YMMV but we got there at a good time on a good night and had fun. I don't know that I'd come back, as there are so many choices around Vegas, and I think this is a chain, so I'd avoid it maybe for that reason as well.  But if a group made the choice to go here, I know I would be able to find something I liked, no question."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  If you are a vegan or vegetarian, please stop here and give this place a try.  pro tip! check in on yelp and get a free margarita.  The portion size was generous and the Vegetarian nachos were AWESOME!!! This place completely and totally lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"Loved the food, wait staff was awesome. Cheese sauce needed a little more heat but added some hot sauce and it was pretty good. No wait to be seated."}
{"text":"Bad experience here ,after we've had finished our meals my wife and daughter had not gotten their orders when we asked what had happened  our waitress replied that she ran out of paper whatever that meant.Here on vacation for the holidays our hotel recommended this restaurant very disappointed with the service ."}
{"text":"My friends and I were in Vegas for the Rock n Roll Half Marathon. After running 13.1 miles we figured this would be the perfect place to sit down and celebrate. We had a group of 5 and we waited no more than 5 minutes for a table. Our waiter came out and got us our drinks quickly which was nice.   The atmosphere is very laid back. The TV's inside the restaurant were playing mainly rap music videos which my party really enjoyed.   The food was amazing. We ordered the bottomless chips and salsa and didnt have to wait too long to get refills on chips. We also got the trio sampler which came with some of the best queso I've ever eaten. One of my friends ordered the nachos to share and my mind was blown by how huge the nachos were. They definitely don't skimp out on the food here.   Overall the service was about average. Towards the end of our stay our waiter got busy and didn't visit us as often and we had to try and find her to get our checks.   I would definitely recommend going here and I will be coming back next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Jovanny was awesome! He went above an beyond I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great place, great food! Came on a Wednesday night around 8pm & over half the place was empty. We were worried about a wait but they are probably slower during the week. Very nice atmosphere on the strip.   FOOD: Started with the dip trio. Salsa was spicy & flavorful, but not mouth burning. The guac was delicious! It was chunky & you could taste the onion and garlic. The cheese was zesty with jalapeños, but again not overpowering. I had the chicken chimichanga. I take my chimis bery seriously. Many places claim to have a fried shell but do not OR dont offer the fried shell. Well isnt that a burrito then? This chimi was large in size and had a perfectly fried shell! The chicken inside was flavored very well which mixed masterfully with the guac on top. One negative: there were also beans & the way mine was rolled it seemed like the right half was chicken & the left half was beans instead of being a great combo of each in every bite.  SERVICE: id have to agree with prior reviews & say it was disappointing. Our waitress greeted us with her depressing story about how shed rather be home in bed. Not what anyone wants to chat about before dinner. Perhaps some customer service lessons for the crew are in order.   Overall it was a great dinner & i would / will definitely be back for another try!"}
{"text":"Great nachos and reasonable prices for being right off the strip. Jovanny was a great server! Fantastic personality and service."}
{"text":"This place is so great!! The nachos are to die for and the drinks are to live for!! If your in Vegas don't miss the chance to check this place out and I dare to to take a scorpion shot!! Also Kimberly is the greatest at the bar!!"}
{"text":"Someone please explain to me why I paid so much for something that is, at best, a slight upgrade over Del Taco.  The service was nothing special and the food was far from memorable. So if you want to spend $16 per person (not including drinks) for average food and service, go here.    Otherwise, you get a better value at the Michoacan restaurants.  They charge $13-15 per person but you get chips, soup, a higher quality of food, and the best service in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"After spending four hours in the car we decided to come here and eat after checking in to our hotel. First off, I don't eat meat and I'm SO jealous that we don't have a Nacho Daddy in Los Angeles! I had a \"Chicken\" Fajita salad, and I swear this tasted almost identical to real chicken. The flavors were there and the vegetables tasted fresh. When I overlooked the menu I noticed that they also had plenty of vegan options which I also think is awesome! (Quesadillas, tacos, etc.) my partner had the Chilaquiles and said it was really good (I also don't eat eggs so I can't confirm, but the plate looked amazing). Overall if I'm ever back in vegas I would love to come back and try more off the vegetarian menu! It's so rare that I can go to a Mexican restaurant without worrying about options that fit my diet. Love love love this place!!"}
{"text":"Nacho daddy is amazing! Ask for luz. She is so sweet. Always have a great experience ! The food is always on point. The restaurant is always clean and inviting. Never a dry chip"}
{"text":"The salsa is the best I've ever had!  Only eaten here twice, but each time was fantastic.  Service is good and atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"Came in last night because we had time to kill before our movie. Jovany was our server, and he was AMAZING!! It was super busy, but he managed to make sure everything was perfect, our glasses were never empty, and our chip basket stayed full. All of the staff that we had some sort of interaction with were very friendly."}
{"text":"Service was awesome and so was the food. Felt welcomed as soon as I walked in the door. Our new favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by this place. The service was not good at all, it was hard getting a drink or any kind of attention. The food was very greasy, I litteraly saw the grease dripping out of my tacos... Oh and they don't have any tv sports packages, so please don't bother coming here if you want to watch your favorite team play!"}
{"text":"A very fun place for dinner. Food was great, prices were good and service was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible, tried to bring my family there to sit outside... they weren't seating people outside.. GET YOUR HEATERS FIXED THEN.. I'll never come back."}
{"text":"Do not eat here they have terrible service they have terrible waitresses and their food is disgusting"}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to try this place out. We as a family had a nice experience with our waiter Johnny, who was very friendly and helpful. To the timely manner in which our food came out and the delicious meals we had. Not to mention the relaxing atmosphere of the place. We will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"MIKEY!!! trust in him and it'll be all good! Service was almost to perfect! From him seating us to saying goodbye he not only wowed my family he completely catered to every single need!! This is an amazing location and I'm happy that it's near my home!! The staff is on point and made my husbands bday dinner perfect! Thanks again MIKEY you are awesome!!   Filet nachos are my everything lol Crispy quesadilla was perfection Baby girl didn't love the ground beef taco (kids meal) but we had enough that we are leaving full and ready for bed!!"}
{"text":"I expected more lobster on the nachos. Over seasoned. Left most of the behind. It was not like the pictures.  Update: Thank you Taylor. The picture for the lobster and crab nachos are not piled high. There is clearly 80% more lobster and crab in the picture than we had. This was a bad experience especially after people recommended us to eat there. I hope you gets this corrected."}
{"text":"I really like this place!!   Nacho Daddy has very reasonable prices and an awesome happy hour (Monday - Thursday, 3 - 6)  I tried the enchilada nachos ($15) with red sauce and they were wonderful. Some of the fullest nachos I've ever had, each chip was beautifully smeared.   We sat on the patio and enjoyed people watching. Our server Emily was awesome, along with the host.  $5 Margaritas and small plates during happy hour!!  I am not vegan, however, they had an entire page on the menu with vegan options.  Located on the Harmon side of Miracle Mile near Buffalo Wild Wings / Taco Bell   I will return with every Vegas trip to come"}
{"text":"Good food and great service, not the best food I've ever had but interesting concept. I removed one star from my review since I'm Celiac, and after reading the yelps I thought it was a safe place for me. I was informed that once there that there may be cross contamination in the fryer. I'm still sick from eating gluten and it's been two days since eating there. I don't recommend this place to other gluten free people, it's not safe though the menu has things marked gf, they are not since cross contamination is a big issue there!"}
{"text":"The food was okay nachos were good not great might tried again on a late night. It hit the spot for what I was looking for for my evening dinner"}
{"text":"very good nice friendly service and the food was excellent my only complaint is that its a little pricy"}
{"text":"We couldn't get attention from our waitress but the food runner John was really eager to help us with extra utensils, refills, and sauces. We even got free guacamole! We weren't planning on getting desert, but John recommended the chocolate cake. It was amaaaaaazing. This cake is for you if you like really rich deserts. The nachos were not that great as I thought they would be. They look great since they give you such a big portion, but they get so soggy towards the center that can't really eat it without a fork.    Overall the experience was good and the restaurant had a fun vibe."}
{"text":"The manager Chris made our girls night amazing! The food was hot the atmosphere was great and the service was fabulous! Will be back again and again! Thanks Chris and DJ and Luz!"}
{"text":"Bomb!! Get the cajun nachos, you will not be disappointed, very flavorful, huge serving, nice staff, cool atmosphere, ill be visiting everytime I go to Vegas"}
{"text":"Tried it on recommendation from an uber driver, and was not disappointed! Great food, awesome service, delicious drinks. Will definitely return on our next vegas adventure."}
{"text":"Fiancé and I love this place. We come here often. Good place for food, alcohol or just to hang out. Kid friendly too"}
{"text":"Last year Nacho Daddy accommodated a 20 person Christmas Party we had for our company. We ordered the nacho appetizers which were big platters, and we had one of each type of platter to feed a hungry crew of guys. The prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was great. We actually tried the scorpion shots and they got the party to a different level which was awesome! We thoroughly enjoyed our time there and will gladly recommend Nacho Daddy for lunch, dinner or parties. They deserve all 5 stars"}
{"text":"They had difficulty seating us, even with a reservation and a completely dead restaurant. Food was ok, nothing special. For a nacho place, it was expensive. We spent $115 for 3 people. Our waitress was nice but was the only waitress in there it seemed. There was a huge delay in getting refills and the bottle less chips we had to pay for."}
{"text":"Lauren Koors literally was the greatest. Had the filet mignon nachos and it was fire. And she helped us with the happy hour menu and walked us through all the food we wanted to order. Good honestly was better than expected. Give it a shot. Worth it."}
{"text":"The food was good. The drinks were okay. The people who were working when I was there... definitely seemed miserable like they hate their jobs.  The hostess just seemed generally miserable and had to ask another person how long she should make us wait right in front of us. I don't know if she was new or uncertain, but either way she was grumpy. I had to bite my tongue because this group that came in 10 minutes after us got seated before us. Same hostess said to them let me check where we are with tables and then immediately sat them. Meanwhile we were put us on a waitlist and said I would get a text which never happened."}
{"text":"Came here for Las Vegas Restaurant week, was very pleased with our selections from the Pre-set menu, it was delicious & gave generous sized portions. Enjoyed our drinks, i got the white peach margarita. The atmosphere was very calm not busy at all. Our food came out timely but the service kind of slowed down at the end. Don't forget to check in to receive a free house margarita."}
{"text":"I had a great time here. The service was fantastic, all the staff we interacted with were outgoing and helpful. We brought in outside frozen drinks, which are a no no, but the hostess put them in their fridge for us while we ate, which was nicer than having to chug them.  My boyfriend and I are gluten free and dairy free, and we love Mexican food. We got the vegan queso, which was delicious. We also got the filet minion nachos, they were very tasty but did not have much meat. I got the free margarita with check in and our waitstaff recommended other vegan friendly area restaurants. We will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Host was kind. Server was a bit rude and untimely. She also chose to flirt with a customer at the bar before coming to take our drink order, check on us throughout the meal and bring us our check. Nothing from this experience has me dying to come back. Overall it's nothing special."}
{"text":"Cassandra is awesome! Thanks for keeping things fun! We will be back! Nachos are the way to go here I got the filet mignon one."}
{"text":"Had this for late night when we got in as we didn't feel like walking very far. We were pleasantly surprised! Very good food and HUGE portions! My husband and I shared nachos (we got enchilada nachos with guacamole on top) and we were both very full with this alone! We also each had a margarita! I had the peach marg and my hubby got the house marg (if you check in on yelp you get 1 free house marg)! I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"My first time here was a guys weekend trip and recommended by a family member.  The staff was attentive and friendly.  The bartender answered our questions and gave descriptions and recommendations for the various foods.  We heard the tacos are good but nachos are in the name.  We all had different enters and nobody was disappointed.   Hint...check in with Yelp and get a house margarita free.  Enjoy the scorpion shot if you feel up to it.  Overall,  a very pleasant experience and I will go back."}
{"text":"First time at Nacho Daddy with our friends. The server's name was Jacob. He had a very out going and friendly personality. He was joking with us and made us feel so welcome. Food was absolutely delicious!! Loved the environment. We will be coming back"}
{"text":"I felt that the prices were a little high. Our food was just mediocre. My husband ordered the $24 seafood nachos, and they were certainly not worth the price. Our service was average. If I could make a recommendation, it would be to offer different sized portions of nachos with variable prices. For being a tourist location, it doesn't allow many the option to take \"leftovers\" back to their hotel room, or to sit in a car all night. I would've preferred a smaller portion versus wasting food and $$."}
{"text":"The nachos were soooo good and the portions were huge! Everyone in my party got their own nacho and there was so much left over. 2 people  could easily share!  I ordered the enchilada nachos with added pico and there was a ton of yummy chicken and toppings on every chip. Margaritas were strong but super sweet and with that yelp check in....yasss  Just a tip because its hard to find... walk around the Planet Hollywood casino, not through it.... it's kind of on the south east side of the building and only has a sidewalk entrance that we could see"}
{"text":"This is my first time checking this place out and all I can say is it's damn good! Our server Ari was funny and had great suggestions! The margarita and BBQ Nachos were insane! We I'll be back and will definitely request our girl Ari!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great salad mid day.  Music was good   Nachos were good but peppers in it were surprising hot-  good but surprised us"}
{"text":"Tuesday was our server, she was very inviting and had awesome recommendations, great service ! We ordered the spicy shrimp nachos and they were really good ! We will be back and request her forsure ."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here all the time and we are always impressed. We normally come week day after noons and it's slow and quiet, which is perfect for laid back lunch. Last night we decided to try dinner time, and the atmosphere was totally different but still awesome. Wednesday nights are trivia night, and although we didn't participate this time, we sure will next. If you go for trivia plan on spending 2 hours or so there - that's what the dude told me it takes on average. There were lots of people playing and it was crazy fun just to be around. Busy nights and lazy afternoons - nacho daddy is good anytime of day. I heard they have brunch, I can't wait to try it.   Anyways, last night I got nacho average hamburger nachos and they were awesome. They were exactly like a supped up version of Taco Bell nachos bell grande. If you are stoned or are crazy nacho cheese sauce: get this. It is the caviar of stoner food, I swear. I normally get the filet mignon nachos or the fiesta nachos when I go, which are also both AMAZING. I also tried the fried ice cream - super good. My SO has always liked his food too, but unfortunately I don't remember what he got as I was too immersed in mine. Just know he liked it as well.   As far as service goes, I have always liked our waiters every time we go. However last night a guy named Alex (I think?) served us and he was hardcore working it. At one point I'm pretty sure I saw him running. Running through the place like James Bond just to make sure people get everything on time. That is a wild amount of  dedication to customer service.   I would give this place six stars if I could just because of waiter dedication. Nacho Daddy is hardworking, full of awesome food, and fun and I appreciate it."}
{"text":"I don't get why this place always has a line. Is it because it's trendy? It's ok... I mean, for nachos. The problem I have is that the nachos always get cold before you're half way through. If you're looking for an easy place for a larger group this does the trick. The have some fun drinks... I.e: the scorpion shot - drink at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the sports bar atmosphere and the Enchilada Chicken Nachos-it's hard to pick which to try given the extensive menu, but you probably can't go wrong. Would advise against ordering them for takeout though.  Weird communication issues when picking up my order, combined with an odd choice of takeout packaging- chips, cheese, and protein are boxed in cardboard similar to pizza carryout. Additional toppings are packed separately in Styrofoam and plastic cups. Initially I was put off by this but it grew on me- could add the sour cream, guac, and beans to my preferred level. Portion did not seem adversely affected by the box used.  Flavors though? Tasty. Chicken and encihlada sauce was well seasoned but not spicy, large rings of jalapenos made it easy to eat around them if you want, portion was large enough to share- maybe add on some tacos and this is easily dinner for two.   Bonus star for having queso on the menu- one of the few places in town to do so, and one of the major things I miss from home! ."}
{"text":"This review is purposefully not using the free WiFi offered at this establishment. My IP address is not theirs.   This place is amazing! We got the lobster and crab nachos. Share them. They are huge. Flavor combination so perfect I didn't need to add hot sauce.   Cadillac margaritas are WOW! Tasty and huge.   Server: AJ is incredible. He bends over backwards to make sure your experience is nothing short of perfection.   Will be trying for breakfast...stay tuned!"}
{"text":"Great vegan food options! If I'm. Ever back in the area I'd stop by again. Try their vegan nacho plate it's the best!"}
{"text":"The good:  The service was very good, very attentive and the table seemed to be a priority for him.  4 stars for the server.  The bad:  the food is terrible!  I mean really, really, bad.  This is a nacho place, but the chips are horrible,  the toppings are sparse (except for the connivence store pump cheese) and no free chips and salsa, once we tried them this wasn't a big deal.  The two stars are for the deserts, we had the fried ice cream and caramel apple nachos and they were good, but the chips they used were oily and greasy.  My advice is to pass and get your mex food fix from faustos or Roberto's."}
{"text":"I landed here quite randomly but boy, am I glad! I am a Mexican food snob after having lived in Mexico for a year and this s#%! Is the BOMB! The beans are amazing, the meat fresh, the presentation gorgeous. I'm in love!!!"}
{"text":"Their queso, naked grilled chicken and the spicy margarita(sooo good) was to die for! It was really hard to stop myself from eating!! Though there were a lot of empty tables but still they made us wait for 15 minutes which was weird but otherwise overall ambience/service was good.."}
{"text":"First time there, filled up on appetizers so went straight to dessert. Amanda was our server she was great and checked on us frequently. The margaritas were the highlight of the meal for sure."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite place for nachos! We walked in not knowing what to expect. There was a scorpion cage next to the host which was awesome. Our host, Dominique, was extremely friendly. She happily gave us time to explore both the main menu and the happy hour menu. We went with the main one. She asked us about our day and was super friendly the whole way to our table.   We were seated and met our server Rachel. Rachel came to our table right away and was super nice. She was happy to use our check-in offer on yelp (free margarita). I joked about being ID'd and that started up a conversation with her and our table. After that, it felt like we were friends!  We chose the fiesta nachos and they did not disappoint. Some nachos are overwhelming after a few bites. Not these. They were consistently delicious until  there was nothing left. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"So my fiancé I and literally just walked out of here. We have been wanting to try this place for quite sometime now. We drove by and it wasn't busy at all and had plenty parking. Walked in and was seated right away. Was told by the hostess that Cesar would be our server. We waited for 10 mins and no one came by at all to even give us water. 5 more mins go by still no server. All the sudden Cesar is now serving a table that just walked in meanwhile we haven't been served at all. We decided to get up and leave. We returned the menus to the hostess and she could careless. We told her we are leaving because we didn't get served and she didn't even say sorry or anything. She then blamed it on shift change and we told her shift change is fine but at least let us know or something. How you have shift change but our server is serving a group that just walked in and sat down? Sorry they won't ever get my money. Also there was a manger up front while all this happened wearing a red shirt and she didn't care that we walked out neither. Will not be back ever. Sorry taking my money somewhere else especially for $16.99 nachos and $5.50 a la carte tacos"}
{"text":"We walked all the way there for over an hour and a half for the guy with the curly long hair and glasses to tell us that the kitchen was closed although it says that the restaurant doesn't close until 3"}
{"text":"ok they seem a little pricey for what you get but I must say it was good. Tried the buffalo wing nachos and they have that wing taste we were looking for. Wait staff friendly. Worth a try if your are in the area."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Quick service by friendly staff and the BBQ chicken nachos were amazing. Split them between 2 and it was perfect portion size"}
{"text":"I've never had amazing Mexican food. To me it all tastes the same. This place was no different, but don't get me wrong.. the food was very good. Just lacks the wow factor as I found it to be very standard. My Cadillac Margaritas were fantastic.. the shrimp appetizer was just ok, nothing special. The food was huge portions, so big that we couldn't finish.    I did want to come back to try some of their nacho options but ran out of time. In the future if these nacho options end up being amazing, I will change my review to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was going to be this good. I had the vegan fajitas and it was delicious. The tofu was actually seasoned compared to some places that pat themselves on their backs for simply carrying meat alternatives. Definitely can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy should be a Vegas institution (if it is not already). Amazing range of delicious options and excellent service makes for a fantastic evening in any one of their 3 Vegas locations.  Our server tonight (Jovany) was particularly great and almost earned an invitation to join us as he was such fun."}
{"text":"Awesome place great food and service our server Chase was wonderful and very accommodating and made some great suggestions which we were very pleased with.  Thank you Chase!!"}
{"text":"Not going to lie, my wife and I had an AMZING time here. We sat at the bar and were thoroughly entertained by the bar tender who obviously just woke up to start his 8pm shift. We drank mags, did shots, and ate fajitas! Honestly I had very low expectations for this place but we were absolutely pleasantly surprised. Now I will say that the food was decent, the margs were great but we also fell into a really fun experience. If we hadn't of bantered with the bar tender this place would have just been another chain Mexican restaurant. My recommendation is to sit at the bar and chat up the bar tenders. They're good peeps."}
{"text":"Delicious!! I loved the queso. My entree was a grilled filet mignon taco and a grilled fish taco - it was excellent. The fish taco was my favorite. Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"This place was the awesome!!! Food and portion were outstanding. We were seated within 5 min of our reservation. Great craft beer selection and the ladies stated Margarita's were tasty!!! We tried the grilled corn skillet, bottomless chips & salsa and triple dip for appetizer and it was a hit as both skillets and bowls were clean!!! Our group shared the BBQ Chicken, Filet Mignon, Fiesta Nacho's and Chicken fajita's.  It's great to see the manager making several trips through the restaurant checking with patrons about their food, drink and experience..."}
{"text":"Ooh my goodness! These nachos were BOMB! I couldn't get enough! I got the Mardi Gras themed nachos with shrimp, chicken, and adouille sausage. It was just absolutely delicious! Every bite was amazing.  As for everything else, this location is very spacious, our waiter was awesome, and the ambiance was chillaxed and causal.... but those nachos were to die for! I really want some more soon!"}
{"text":"Lobster nacho was on point. The toppings also had mango so it was different but good different, I liked it a lot.   We also got the chicken and pork tamales, the chicken was good. The pork one was a little too salty.   All the staff were really nice and fun. Went here for a quick bite before day club so didn't get too much food. I will come back to try more nachos!"}
{"text":"First time here.. awesome service from the hostess to our server Jovany. Jovany was cheerful, fun and most importantly professional. Food is awesome and variety is great. Definitely making this place a must every time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The Nachos were tempting but we all settled for for other dishes. Enchiladas were great. Margaritas were strong enough and the service was good.  Noise level seemed higher than suggested but it was Las Vegas so we managed. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy is pretty legit. I didn't have Nachos, but watching everything come out was pretty good looking. I had breakfast and the chilequiles were pretty good. The beans were excellent, the eggs were tasty, chips with sauce was decent but needed a little more sauce. The salsa was supposed to be hot, but was really more mild to medium, so don't expect hot. I did have the free House Margarita because of my check-in. It was just ok. Seems like very little alcohol, but it was free, so no complaints. Overall, prices were decent and good was worth it. Good stopping spot!"}
{"text":"After a poor experience from the downtown location, it was my last hope for Nacho Daddy.  My local location on Eastern had closed so I had my fingers crossed.  Luckily everything went smoothly and remained consistent with Eastern.   We had great service from Johnny. He looked familiar and found out he also was a waiter at my local location.  Wonderful!  He was attentive, funny and friendly.  Our drinks were never dry and it was done with a smile.    Keeping with the known, we tried what we would usually order ~ Supreme Tostada Nachos as well as the Fajita Cheese Steak Sandwich.  The nachos were piled high with ingredients of meat, cheese, tomatoes, jalapeños sour cream and guacamole.  Chips were crisp and warm.  Delicious.  Our sandwich met the standards of the table.  Filled wonderfully with steak, onions peppers and quest.  Great sandwich indeed!  Bonus~ There is a free house margarita with Yelp check in.  Just a cherry on top of our fun visit here.  I was very satisfied and look forward to my next trip out this way!"}
{"text":"Not worth it. Overpriced for midlevel run-of-the-mill Mexican comfort food. Menu seems designed to gouge the patron at every turn. You have to pay for chips and salsa and if you have more than four people the price doubles. Drinks are priced like a night club. Basic burrito is $11... Unless you want meat and it goes to $16+. Top this off with the fact that we had to move our family to get away from overwhelming sewage smell. Server Richard was prompt and friendly, even when we asked to move away from the fecal odor. Nonetheless, we'll just go back to always good, always reliable Macayos just a few miles east."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast because it was one of the very limited places that had vegan options. We sat at the bar and Cassandra our waitress was great.   I got the spicy vegan burrito, it was spicy which was great and it came with a side of chips and salsa. It was definitely one of the better vegan burrito I've had.   also, I got a free house margarita just for checking in on yelp. Yaaay!    Will be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The first time it was really good. The service was great, the food was amazing, and the drinks were strong. I decided to bring my parents the next time to show them how good it was, and unfortunately they were disappointed. The waiter left halfway through our time there and we found out from the new waitress that he had somehow not put in my dad's order. So the rest of us were already half way through our meals before my dad's came out. The quesadilla they ordered was supposed to have chicken and only had cheese. The waitress felt so bad for all of the mistakes that were made though she took my dad's meal, the quesadilla, and another 20% off the bill which made it 1/2 as much as it should have been. I was very impressed with them fixing their mistakes, and I will continue to support them in the future."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I went to Vegas for four days and ate here three times. They have food specials, awesome queso dip (we got it all three times) and amazing service. Audre the hostess was so sweet and very personable, she was really welcoming! Hazelanne was our server twice and she was phenomenal, gave us recommendations and everything was delicious. Jordan ran our food and was super nice too, he helped us out anytime we needed anything. Our bartender Scarlett had our drinks flowing and was always there when we needed anything. Angie was one of the managers we talked to and she was really nice as well. We took one of the scorpion shots (something I neverrr thought I would do) it was weird but definitely an experience. If I were you I would ABSOLUTELY check this place out!"}
{"text":"Nachos are pretty good but the service is worse than horrible. Got here  and it was pretty empty but had to wait to be seated, so sat at the bar instead. We sat at the bar for 20 minutes and asked repeatedly to be served. Finally just went back to the greeter and got a seat at a table and service was still slow AF."}
{"text":"Arieanna was friendly and very knowledgeable  about the menu. We went with her recommendation and picked the Supreme Tostada Nacho and OMG!! These Nachos did not disappoint! It's so hard to find a good order of nachos, this place sure knows what they are doing! All of the ingredients tasted so fresh and tasty! It all came together perfectly! I also ordered the breakfast taco, the tortilla was soft and buttery, the beans were perfect, rice could've been softer but the great flavor was there!  Thanks for the recommendation and friendly service! You Rock!!! Please bring one to Orange County!!! Definitely looking forward to coming back here next time we visit, why we didn't come here more throughout our visit is beyond me! Come check them out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"OMG! The Vegan Chik'n nachos are the things dreams are made of.  The service here is meh. I've been twice during hours between lunch and dinner when the place is not crowded and its a wait to get a table (even though there is plenty of seating) and then a wait to get your beverages and order taken. However, its bearable for those nachos. They are not lacking in anything and possibly even better than the original because of all the delicious veggies. I haven't even tried anything else because NACHOS!  I see they added vegan chocolate cake and I might have to save room for that next time. See, I'm already planning my next visit  NACHOS!"}
{"text":"Two words.. VEGAN NACHOS! Holy guacamole, guys! The vegan nachos were ridiculously delicious and such a HUGE portion. Not only that, but the topping:chip ratio was on point. I hate nachos that have too many chips or way too much topping. This was perfection... tasty nacho perfection. They also have a whole page dedicated to delicious vegan options which I am just so giddy about.  Boyfriends fajitas came out sizzlin! Which is great because that is the hallmark of a fajita that sometimes is lacking at other restaurants. He also would like to say that the fajitas were good and big enough of a portion to share between two people... come to think of it, I could have shared my nachos too. But I'm a fat greedy vegan girl who don't want to. I digress. The service, food, and beer was all wonderful. The ambiance was nice too, lots of big TVs playing music videos (a lot of them from the 90s which was pretty entertaining). Only wish they had a vegan dessert option! That kinda bummed me out, but I'll definitely be returning regardless."}
{"text":"Kimberly was super annoying and overrated as fuck.   Just kidding. She was hilarious and charming and very helpful. The food was unbelievable and the marg was exceptional. It was one of the highlights in Vegas to come here. We are always looking for good Mexican places on the road, and this was a treasure. The bar area is extremely clean and has a cool, almost steampunk vibe.  Come for the marg, stay for the food and cool people."}
{"text":"Absolutely Loved It Fast and friendly service, free drink with a visit to Yelp, great food.   My BF and I shared An entree and salad. The meal was perfect size for us. We had the hot wings chicken nachos. They were spicy adelicious with ranch dressing!    My only comment would be. The salad dressing choices were limited to ranch or blue cheese. We like a lighter dressing."}
{"text":"OMG. Food so good I could cry. Portions are big and the environment is even better !! Good music, lots of TVs and a great indoor outdoor experience !! Make sure if you sit at the bar you ask for Arnold,he's the best."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was just bad timing. Multiple servers dropped their serving tray and spilled things all over when we were there. Service was also quite slow. Our margaritas were very inconsistent even when we ordered the same thing. One glass taste like juice and the other taste like it's pure tequila. The food also didn't impress me very much."}
{"text":"Great food great service. Tacos are amazing and so are burritos! Team works together to make sure you have everything you need! Can't wait to go back! It's a must when visiting Vegas! Try a scorpion!  I Did!"}
{"text":"Great margaritas served in a generous sized glass. Love the fiesta nachos, there are enough for two people to share or one if you're super starved. The Cadillac margarita is my favorite. Date got the Cucumber jalapeño margarita ."}
{"text":"I gave this 1 star . I went during lunch one day.. took 45 mins for an order of nachos.  Which would be understandable if they were busy. But, literally i was customer number 3 in there .. The lady who took my order never said it was going to be such a long wait.  Never even walked by me to let me know what was going on.. I had to tell her i needed my money back because i couldnt wait any longer since i only had an hours lunch time. But,just as i was telling her that ,out comes my order. Well, i will tell you that i love food. I don't mind paying a high  price, if the food was worth it. So, in this case it was definitely not. By the time i drove across the parking lot to eat the nachos were already getting soggy.  The flavor was really not there at all. The only thing i liked on the chicken nachos was the sour cream. I know everyone has a different taste pallet. With that being said i will not be returning."}
{"text":"We come to Vegas at least once a year. This was our first time here! Our bartender , Scarlett, was personable , made the best Margarita, and steered us right on food!  What a great find! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm a true nacho lover and these always hit the spot! Also they have purse hooks and USB chargers under the bar - and the bartenders are super friendly! Thats the way to this girls heart"}
{"text":"We just ordered nachos and a burrito for delivery (via postmates) and were very disappointed by the quality of the food. It was average at best and pretty forgettable. We won't likely return again."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Nacho Daddy a few months ago and the food took forever to come out. It was very empty and we didnt understand why two adult meals and two kids meals room so long. Finally food came and manager was very apologetic and even comp'd our dinner. The food was just okay. I am thankful they have professional management and made our time nice.    I wanted to visit this place for a while and was not that impressed.  No need to go back. Not just because the food took forever but the meal was just ok.   Edit after company comment below: I can appreciate a company that reads and responds to their customer's reviews. So because of that and how great the manager and team were on site, I will make a point to visit again. Just to get another experience and check out the food once more. I appreciate a company that takes pride in their service."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and we got The Nasville nachos and a Cali Burrito and it was FREAKING DELICIOUS!!! :D   FOOD TIP: Check-in with yelp and you'll get a FREE margarita with a purchase of entree.   SHOUT OUT to our bartender/serve Edward and Rebecca for their AMAZING SERVICE!!! :D  Edward recommended us the Nasville nachos which was ssssooo good!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!   My boyfriend and I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"OMG!  I'm a vegan and I can't eat chicken quesadillas very often for obvious reasons--- but I had one at Nacho Daddy and it was delicious.  I ate so much \"cheese\" and didn't feel like crap after, I can't get over it.  Not only do they have vegan cheese and chicken but it's ALL house made, none of this Daiya cheese and Gardein chicken crap!  My friend and I just so happened to be here on a Monday, on VEGAN MONDAY ;D and we each got a free beer (any beer, not just shitty PBR) with our entree.  He ordered the spicy chicken burrito and isn't vegan but loved his meal.  Then guess what it was happy hour and we downed mini Coronas for only $1 each.  Not done yet, my friend thought he knew one of the customers there from back home and I was like no way you know this guy from the East Coast--- turns out HE DID!  He worked with this guys 10 years ago in Pennsylvania, PA folks!!!  \"Nacho Daddy bringing old friends together again\""}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the food was amazing. Drinks were right on point! Best part of it was our waitress. Short little thing named Gabby! She was so sweet, very helpful and fun! She really made our first time here a great one!!! My Hunny buns and i will be coming back soon! WOO HOO to Gabby(waitress)!"}
{"text":"This place is so fabulous. The daddy's bowl with a fried egg is a big winner.  Served up expertly by DollaBill!"}
{"text":"Definitely had the time of my life. First time here and did not expect it to go the way it went. We had a group of 19, sat upstairs in the loft area and our waiter, DJ, was super fun and friendly.   Filet Mignon Nachos - wow, never have I ever had such amazing nachos. the filet mignon was cooked well and the cheese, toppings, and chip ratio was perfect.   Free margarita with check-in too! It literally tastes like lemonade. I loved it!"}
{"text":"Excellent margaritas and by happy hour BBQ pork sliders. Our bartender Alex was great!  Will always come back!"}
{"text":"Filet mignon nachos were great and the service was amazing! Kudos to Ari... super nice bartender! I also had the mango jalapeño margarita which was not on the menu. Not too sweet with a little kick. Will come back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We came in on a Tuesday afternoon and though it was admittedly empty the ambience was still warm and inviting overall. The four of us were seated and served right away by Davor (Excellent job by the way - very quick and nice) and we ordered a couple of their nacho plates for variety, the Thai nachos, the BBQ chicken, and then the Sloppy Jose. It came out quickly and we were pretty impressed with them all! Great portions, great ingredients, and I'll say now how actually shocked how quality the thai nachos were. 3 plates sated the 4 of us and then some, and afterwards we had the fried ice cream. Also an amazing choice - one of the better ones I've ever had.  Ultimately happy with the entire visit, and would recommend to anyone looking to just go all out on Mexican-American goodness."}
{"text":"Very creative nachos, I must say. Cool environment and actually open later. You'd think places would stay open later in Vegas but that's not always the case."}
{"text":"So, an update from my previous review. I was promptly contacted by Taylor Smith. Taylor was very eager to satisfy my complaint with the poor staff. I must say, I am very satisfied with the outcome. Thank you Taylor. I will continue to be a Nacho Daddy customer due to your efforts."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this facility. When we were led to our seat, we waited almost 10 minutes before we saw the waitress. When she arrived, she spoke and walked away from the table before we could even speak back. When she came back, we asked if we could move to a booth, she rolled her eyes and waldisappointing.  ked away. She came back, took the water off the table, and informed us that we could sit there and someone would be by to clean it off-then she rolled her eyes and walked away. My friends (it was 4 of us) decided to walk out. When I informed the manager of why we were leaving, her response was \"ok sorry, have a great day\". I understand why the worker's attitude is subpar, as the manager's attitude isn't reflective of someone who cares about the customer; she expressed no sympathy for the fact that we were leaving or the actions of her employee. We were visiting from out of town and went that because of the reviews and the restaurant being zagat rated.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Much better experience this go around, Taylor! Drinks were just right. Of course, the food is still top \"nach!\" The Chicken Tinga Nachos are my fave now. The Filet Nachos didn't disappoint either! Finished things off with Churro Sundae, too. Service was spot on! BTW, thanks for letting us know about the other locations, but we're perfectly content here."}
{"text":"YESSS. Finally found a restaurant with a vegan friendly menu. This is for you, my non meat and animal product eating friends. This place actually offersburritos, tacos etc. with meat substitute options that are not tofu. Now, let's leave the debate alone about how good for you these meat substitutes are, the point is you now have options. We went in on \"meatless Monday\" where you get a free beer if you order off the vegan menu. We don't drink, but unique concept. The food was very tasty, though their salsa was mediocre. Service was also good, as our waiter was quick and helpful.   See you soon nacho daddy"}
{"text":"Let me just tell you !! We went back two nights in a row!!!  I couldn't wait for the Michael Jackson cirque to be over just to get another round of nachos !! N fajitas!  Vegan menu is AMAZING! I want to fly back from jersey right now my mouth is watering!! And the gluten free chocolate cake is awesome."}
{"text":"I came here with some girlfriends before they (NOT ME!) went to see Backstreet Boys at Planet Hollywood. I figured this place would fit the bill for a good booze buffer.  I was so happy to see an extensive vegan menu. I don't know what to do with that kind of choice. I went the nachos route, and it was a huge portion of pretty good vegan toppings. I got the free house margarita with the Yelp check-in, and it was surprisingly bad. I didn't drink much because it was too sweet for me, but my friends thought it was too sour so we left it behind. They seemed to like their upgraded margaritas.  Service was good, and I was surprised how calm the restaurant was on a Friday night. Apparently, Super Bowl Weekend in Vegas isn't the rager I thought it would be.  Bonus feature: the TVs had the kind of videos from the '90s and '00s that I'm nostalgic for: Rancid, Incubus, etc. No boy bands."}
{"text":"We were on the hunt for a late craving. We passed this place up but came back to it and so glad we did. I had the filet mignon nachos, which were amazing and the supreme tostada nachos were also so damn good! The service was great and the drinks were as great! The music added to the night life in Vegas with the tv screens showing the music videos.   I would so come back!"}
{"text":"We came hungry at 9 pm and it took a while to get our drink orders. Once they were brought, the bartender had messed up the maragritas and swapped sugar with salt. The waitress seemed pretty frustrated with us, despite the girls being clear with their order.  When we finally got our food order in, I was happy at least the food was good. Ordered the lobster tacos and they come with refried beans and rice. The breaded lobster was crispy and a perfect complement to the corn salsa and avocado. The beans and rice also had a unique flavor.  Summary - food delicious, service not so much."}
{"text":"Lookin for places in Vegas that we're vegan friendly. This place has a great selection of Vegan food and taste great. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"WOW!! This place is the best. The BEST. I wish we found it sooner on our trip. They have an entire vegan section that is to die for. We got one of every vegan item. The loaded nacho plate was just unbelievable. The chicken tacos were mouthwatering. Oh man, it was all so good. I can't stress how amazing this was. How they made the vegan food taste so good I'll never know.  The atmosphere is loud and almost bar like. There is a bar in the middle. Big TVs all around. Very nice service and waitress.   Would absolutely 10000% go back."}
{"text":"I originally gave them 4 stars because I thought they had crappy store bought chips and felt if they made their own it would be 5 Stars.  Then the manager replied in 2 Minutes to let me know they make them in house fresh daily which is almost unbelievable because as I've said, they taste like cheap store bought chips that are so thin and tasteless that they break and crumble before you can even scoop anything on them, so I've now changed this to 3 stars because the chips are an epic fail."}
{"text":"This had amazing customer service that I've seen in a very long time. Were told there was a 45 minute wait time, ended up waiting for about an hour. Manager brought us appetizers and drinks on the house due to unexpected wait time. Service was absolutely great. The food was amazing. If you are looking for vegan options this is the spot. Veggie tacos were beyond amazing and Vega nachos were the best I've ever had. Try this place out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is the vacation of trying new things. Ordered the Thai chicken nachos and the pork enchiladas. Even got s free margarita for checking in :) the nachos had a sweet and tasty flavor. Hubby seemed to enjoy the enchiladas. Service was good, Hazel was very sweet and had a smile on her face the whole time."}
{"text":"Service sucked from start to finish but the food was good and if I return it's because of the food not the service !!! Host was rude and skipped me and the couple who walked in before us and let 3 guys who walked in after all us sit first !!! And I had 3 ppl in my party as well !!!! They sat me at a high table top with a two year old thank god she didn't fall off the chair .... server forgot my Margarita I had to remind her. And we gave her our debt card took her ten mins to come back with it ..... ...... I give service a 1 and food a 10 !!!! Tell your host to smile more not once did she smile at all ....."}
{"text":"It sounds obvious, but we love the nachos!  The enchilada nachos come with a choice of green or red sauce-for those who are choosy. For the indecisive, like myself they will let you get both!  You should try it out!  They also have a Self Serve craft beer wall where you can pre pay for your craft beers (on a card) and then go pour 'em yourself!  The wait staff has been consistently friendly every time we've been here. EVERY TIME. That's rare in Vegas."}
{"text":"Decent food. Unfortunately not great service until the end when we were saved by an amazing waitress. But fun atmosphere and love the indoor/outdoor feel at the bar area."}
{"text":"Super nice staff, clean, and the food is great. I got he cheesy enchiladas . Also, the margaritas are bomb."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here beginning of February. Our first time, and we loved everything!  Our server, I believe her name is Judy, was very honest and helpful with recommendations.  For example, she recommended items that were not only delicious (we ended up ordering most of them), but they weren't the most expensive items on the menu either. I found that important because there are so many servers at other restaurants whose recommendations aren't actually that tasty, but just happen to be the most expensive item. Or, all the items they recommend are really expensive, which I find they're just bs-ing for a bigger tip.   Anyway, Judy was attentive, honest about the food, friendly, and polite!  My husband and I shared the filet mignon shrimp combo fajitas (so damn good!) and despite us having a smaller cost order, our service was excellent! You know how sometimes the service kind of goes down because not much was ordered? Not the case for us that night.   I'm also a HUGE salsa lover, but not a lover of all salsas-if the salsa isn't spicy and if it's watery...no thanks! But the salsa here is the blended type (which I love because it'll stay on the chip easily and it's my watery) and each kind was tasty and spicy in its own way.   Only thing we didn't like too much- the house margaritas had too much of the mix in it. If it were just a little less, then they would've been the best house made margaritas I've had.    But we will still definitely go back for the food and try the margaritas again!"}
{"text":"Omg this was our first time here!!!!! We will definitely be back here!! Lobster and crab nachos. Omg to die for. Aimee was our waitress and she also was amazing ! HIGHLY  RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!!! If I could give more stars I would!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us came here in the mid afternoon. We were seated right away. Our server Daria was extremely friendly and provided great recommendations. She mentioned that 1 nacho was enough to split. I'm glad we did because we got the supreme tostada nachos. They were not only gluten free but so good. It was definitely enough for myself and my fiancé to split.  Fun fact: they have a scorpion shot. That's out of my league but definitely something to try if you are feeling dangerous."}
{"text":"Kimberly is the best!!!!  We checked in and got free house margs and on top of that the Fiesta Nachos are to die for.   LOVE THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Great timely service. Fun atmosphere and the supreme nachos were very, very good. Had the red and green sauce as well. Barely touched the red. It was good, but the green sauce was a perfect compliment to the nachos. The Mexican corn on the Cobb was delicious as well. All washed down with a \"Daddy\" Dos Equis Amber. Will hoist again next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Service is vreat.cood came out fast. Music was perfect. Vegan options were amazing. Everyone in our party was very happy with the food."}
{"text":"Tried out this place bc of the reviews. There was a wait list when we got there but we were seated in about 10 minutes. The food was okay and portions were big."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was amazing! We had the Enchilada nachos with Chicken and the BBQ nachos - both were excellent. Looking forward to coming back here the next time we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was our first stop after arriving to Vegas since it was close to our hotel (Planet Hollywood). Arienne was our waitress and she was awesome!! Very attentive and on top of everything, especially when we (as a group of 4) were joined by friends and expanded to a group of 10.  Food was great! Had variety for a Mexican restaurant (Buffalo chicken nachos!) and brought the authentic flavor of Mexican food.  Highly recommend this place!! And if you check in on Yelp- you can get any 1 Margarita for 8.95. ;)"}
{"text":"Service not so great, food was good. I never got my soda. The busboy spilled sour cream on my friends shirt  and on his leg, the waitress told the manager. The manager showed up at the end of the meal  and gave  us a friend and family discount. Half off one meal.  We were in Vegas and planning on going somewhere after, we asked if they had a T-shirt so my friend could change and we could continue on with our night. The management added it to the bill! We didn't want a shirt,  just didn't want to go back to the hotel and change. Not happy with how the incident was handled."}
{"text":"Service was good. Didn't have to wait long for server after we sat down and she was very nice and helpful.   Drinks were pretty good. We got the Daddy's Margarita which was a good size and not completely filled with ice like most places. You could actually taste the alcohol and it was only $12.   Food was absolutely delicious.  Chips and salsa were good, but salsa was a little too runny. Fiesta nachos were SO GOOD.  I also got pork street tacos (mini appetizer size) and there was so much meat packed in I had to take some out just to fold the taco and I could only eat 2 out of the 3.   If there are 2 of you, chips and salsa and an order of fiesta nachos would have been plenty to share.   On my way out I saw a terrarium and thought, oh interesting, but saw a bunch of crickets (eww) in there and wondered what was up with that. Later I read about the scorpion drinks and I'm glad I didn't know about it while I was eating in the restaurant. I don't need a tub full of insects lurking around in the restaurant that I'm eating at thank you very much!"}
{"text":"Basic food for expensive prices. Atmosphere was bland a lot of throwback rock 2000s. Good deals but the tacos were super bland. Probably a one time deal   Plus side, awesome happy hour and tasty drinks!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a yummy, good size, breakfast or lunch. This is the spot. I love the open ceiling concept, also lots of tvs to catch games. Amazing salsa and chips. During the day time they have awesome music videos (when I was there they had 90s-00s playing). Service is great. I had the egg with enchilada meal with their breakfast sandwich which were both amazing. Pretty good spot with out braking the bank. I'm definitely recommending and coming back."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Elara and was looking for a tasty relatively inexpensive place to eat aside from the big names (that suck) on the strip. Yelp came to the rescue and I saw the Nacho Daddy was within the Miracle Mile which is connected to the Elara. It feels like you're exiting the property which you are but when you turn right, the establishment is right there close to - couple yards from the intersection of Las Vegas Blvd. If you sit outside you can hear and see a lot of the hustle of the strip.   Nachos were really good, I was happy to see all the vegetarian options. I would have liked my nachos to be more cheesy. They were perfectly spiced however and the flavors all melded very well. Huge portions and so two people can easily share. I had a peach margarita along with my meal which was quite strong but good. I was happy with the prospect that I could take it to go as I had an early morning but still wanted to enjoy it back in my room. They had live music while I was there and it was a fun little joint to enjoy when you sort of just want to get away from what is the strip. Will defiantly be back when in Vegas. Not for that scorpion shot though!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were great. We had the shrimp tacos and filet mignon nachos. Both were delicious. Best nachos I've had ever. Service and atmosphere is fantastic"}
{"text":"Great food but better drinks!  Tiauna kept the drinks flowing at the bar and was very friendly which lifted my mood and really cheered me up!  I will come back again thanks to her!"}
{"text":"Stopped with the grandkids for some afterschool snacking and outdoor patio great weather atmosphere.  The delicious Nacho Supreme and Four Cheese Nachos were a perfect quick meal before we hit the library.  Our waiter Richard was upbeat, friendly and helpful since it was our first time. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch by myself, and sat at the bar with Davor. I had heard about the vegan menu and was excited to check it out. I ordered a Michelada and he suggested using Negra Modelo, which I had never had before. It was delicious! Davor made the perfect Michelada. I ordered chips and salsa and the crispy avocado tacos off of the vegan menu. As I ordered, he let me know it was taco Tuesday so my tacos would only be $5...score! My meal was great, service was great, and I will definitely be back. Thank you to Davor for making my first experience a great one!"}
{"text":"Looking for something different on the strip and found Nacho Daddy.  The staff was friendly and very attentive.  Ordered the triple dips which is salsa, guacamole and white queso.  The salsa and guacamole were good but the queso was da bomb.  Ordered the bacon, egg and cheese enchiladas from the all day breakfast menu.  It was good but it would've been better if the sauce was actual enchilada sauce not salsa.  Overall a good experience.  Next time I'm trying the nachos."}
{"text":"VEGAN MENU!!!!  Finally, vegan food that taste soooooooo good!!!!  We frequent Las Vegas a few times throughout the year and we always eat at the same Vegan eateries and although those other places are good... NACHO DADDY is the absolute best!!!!! We came in for the first time with our car club family and have never heard of this place before, and since we were invited we kinda were just gonna settle with a salad or something because most places don't offer a vegan menu. Surprisingly this place hand one and we were super excited.  I ordered the Fajta Bowl and my husband ordered the chicken fajitas. We had some special request and the waitress SERRENA got our order right on the spot!!  Fast forward to today. We are going back home to San Francisco so we stopped in for breakfast since they opened at 8. And guess who our waistress was... We got our seats and our waitress SERRENA immediately remembered us from the other night AND she also remembered what we ordered AND the specifics (no cilantro, add jalapeños etc) i was immediately impressed and she is super sweet and friendly! The funniest part was when she caught my husband inspecting his vegan chicken and she came up to ask if everything was ok. We laughed because one he got caught and two because the reason he was inspecting it was because it taste just like real chicken and the flavor was amazing! Hands down the best service and vegan food in all of Las Vegas!! I hope the manager reads this and let's Serrena know that she's an awesome person and is a huge reason why we will return!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had lunch here and we're pleasantly surprised.  The food was great large portions and our server was phenomenal. We will return."}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE!! Had the carnitas nachos a Margarita and Had a scorpion shot sooo good!! Will come back!!"}
{"text":"After my initial review I was contacted by the manager and told that the employee was spoken to as well as reminders given about cleanliness to all staff.  I was also given a gift certificate for a future return date of my choosing.  Although this definitely was not expected and surely was not my intention of seeking compensation, I do sincerely appreciate the nice gesture."}
{"text":"I came here with my wife for a drink before dinner time.  We ordered a couple of daddy's margaritas which were good a little sweet so we added a shot to it for $5 and it was good for the money.  We also got a free house margarita for checking in which was good as well.  Ordered the BBQ chicken nachos to split, the BBQ sauce was kind of spicy which was really good.  Overall the bartenders were really nice and attentive, enjoyed this place would come back again!"}
{"text":"No Joke, best mexican restaurant I've been to in a very long time.  I'm so glad I found this place on Yelp.  My cousin and I came here not knowing what to expect.  We were blown away at how good the food was!    We both got nachos and the signature tacos plate, phenomenal!!!!    I can't wait to go back to Vegas just so I can visit Nacho Daddy again,  I liked it better than the Baccanal Buffett in Caesars!  Much more affordable too.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I didn't like the margarita. It was sour and tart. The nachos were good but they were $18. I know. Everything is expensive in Vegas. It would have helped to have someone to share them with so I felt like I got a better deal. Spicy salsa was delicious. Service was great that's why I didn't rate it a 2."}
{"text":"Not bad - just a notch above Chilis. They do have some good nachos though and its in a convenient location on the strip, but not really directly on the strip. You can get a free margarita if you check in on yelp so make sure you do that."}
{"text":"Love the fact that they have a great vegan menu option , servers are very attentive and knowledgeable !"}
{"text":"Super convenient and it's also open late which is always a plus! The service was good, and there food was awesome too. They had an amazing selection of food for reasonable prices. The burrito i had was yummy but next time I come in I'm going to have to try some nachos!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty tasty. Really large menu with some things you wouldn't expect to see.   As the name suggests...lots of different nacho plates!  My very favorite thing is Tequila Tuesday! Two for One tequila shots.   We come here for happy hour A LOT! Their sliders are so delicious! and so are their egg rolls!  We're moving soon, and I'm gonna miss being right around the corner from this place. This is my go to place!"}
{"text":"Good food but the service was bad! Not once was I asked if I needed a refill. We also waited for ever to get charged. Not coming back again."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and the portions are very generous, so plan on eating your nacho plate with friends."}
{"text":"This is our second visit to Nacho Daddy and it's one of our favorite places to eat already. The food is excellent and the service is even better. The Nachos are a MUST when in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"When you walk by and you see a tank full of scorpions, you kinda have to stop in.  Located on the south side of the Planet Hollywood building, Nacho Daddy is a hub of great Mexican cuisine and fun Las Vegas drinks and music. With waves of people coming in throughout the night, laughing and drinking on the patio, you will always feel like you belong. The bartenders have a laid back, but attentive, attitude while mixing a delicious house margarita (which was in fact on the house when I checked in on yelp)!  I had the Fajitas, wings, chips and salsa and the blanco queso - I actually didn't order the cheese dip, but it was seriously good on everything. I ended up dipping my wings in it, putting it on my fajitas and of course dipping my chips in it.   One of the owners was there that night and he was hanging and partying with the chef, who was a lot younger than I thought he would have been.   An overall fun night and I look forward to making Nacho Daddy my return to place in Vegas!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ordered a bunch of different options during our lunch, all the food was delicious. The house margaritas on the other hand tasted like lemonade that had twice the amount of sugar, wouldn't recommend the house margaritas. They also had an INSANE amount of vegetarian and vegan options, our group had a few veggie only people and they loved their meals."}
{"text":"BEST NACHOS EVER! We tried the enchilada nachos with green sauce and the filet magnon nachos. Both were so so cute. Waitress was also very sweet. Definitely a must try if you like nachos."}
{"text":"We just got off our flight and checked into the MGM it was about 11:30 pm. We walked from the MGM to the restaurant around midnight. Walked in and the lady who saw us and was up front walked away. So we stood by the entrance for almost 10 minutes watching her walk around, luckily there was a fish tank there to occupy our time. We then saw one of the bussers and asked if we could sit anywhere. He then went to someone who we assumed was the manager and he came up to us and we were told to sit anywhere. Everything else was ok from here on out but those first 15 minutes or so were horrible. My wife also ordered the enchiladas with red and green sauce, but they came out with no sauce. We were tired and hungry so we grabbed to go boxes. We tipped our waitress and said thanks to the big guy watching the floor and left."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant right off of Fremont St. We stopped for breakfast, I had the juevos rancheros and my wife had a fajita bowl. Both dishes were very good. One of my favorite aspects of Nacho Daddy's is the French press coffee they offer, a very nice touch. The service was excellent as well. Don't miss this place if you are downtown in Vegas."}
{"text":"Chase my main man recommended some great options for our group.  Shrimp nachos, corn, and the naked wings were fab!"}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy was delish! My friends and I stopped by after arriving late in Vegas. On a Wednesday, there were limited late night options. I had researched this place before our trip, so I pretty much had an idea of what I wanted to eat. We all ordered different nacho dishes and margaritas and tasted each other's food. Hands down, the best thing we ate was the thai chicken nachos. They were a smaller portion than the other two plates we had (tostada nachos and barbecue chicken nachos), but they were extremely flavorful! I was very impressed by this dish. The margaritas were good, but (unfortunately) not too strong. They were also very sticky from being overfilled, resulting in the drink running down the side of the glass.  The Famous Scorpion Shot: I ordered it. I thought I could drink it, Scorpion included. That didn't happen. The Scorpion looked tiny in other photos and videos I had seen on previous reviews. I assure you, it is not! It's about an inch and a half long, served as a garnish on top of the lime. I asked the server how to eat it. He said he preferred chewing. That wasn't going to happen. Then, I thought about swallowing it whole. So I dropped it in the shot, thinking I could swallow the whole thing and not even flinch. WRONG! Once I put the Scorpion in the shot glass, it magnified the size. Now it looked like a yellow and brown monstrosity, and all I could think was, \"This thing has got to come out of me at some point.\" I chickened out and grabbed the nearest fork and fished that sucker outta there! I did, however, drink the entire shot of tequila without flinching. I should get some credit for that.  My friends mentioned we were there to celebrate my birthday, and the server didn't hesitate to offer me a free shot! That was pretty nice. I definitely didn't expect any freebies in Vegas, on the strip, during a holiday (Halloween) weekend. Overall, this restaurant and service was great! And we talked about those thai chicken nachos for the rest of our trip."}
{"text":"Yum!!! We loved the food and atmosphere. Awesome lobster nachos and located slightly off the strip to offer a more laid back scene."}
{"text":"If you need a reasonably priced Mexican restaurant VERY CLOSE to The Strip - right around the corner from Planet Hollywood, I highly recommend this spot. I don't like walking off Las Vegas Blvd. but this is a mere 1/4 of a block off the beaten path.  I am giving this place 5 stars for several reasons. Taylor, the server, was warm and professional.   The namesake nachos are delicious and can be shared as an appetizer by 4 people. We got the filet mignon nachos but I really wanted to try the buffalo chicken.  The chicken fajitas for two ($23) is a very large portions of white meat chicken, peppers, onions, wraps, rice, beans, guac, sour cream, lettuce, pickled onions and salsa. It's a lot of food but don't worry, we gave it a good home.  Free House Margarita with Yelp check in but we didn't partake of the deal because no one at the liked margaritas."}
{"text":"Server Johnny was amazing and he gave us probably one of the best services we've ever received.  Def will be back"}
{"text":"Heaping mounds of delicious nachos. Not a dry chip just like the ad says. Overstuffed burritos an a large list of beers an tequilas.  Check it out"}
{"text":"There is something to be said about going into a place without Yelping it. There is also something to be said going into a place on the Strip called \"Nacho Daddy\". It sounds like a gimmick to draw you in. We laughed at the name but glanced in and it seemed like a cool spot with open air and all we wanted was a snack to hold us over so it wasn't the end of the world if we had mediocre food.  Fish tacos sounded like a good option for a snack but the waitress upped the ante by suggesting the signature tacos because of the homemade tortilla. I can't possibly say no to that - I was game. And indeed, as she claimed, these grilled fish tacos on homemade tortillas were fantastic. What a great suggestion, one that got us to revisit this place a few days later.  What I will say about Nacho Daddy is that the service and hospitality was excellent in both of our visits. No one left you hanging - people came by right after we sat down but also checked in with us periodically to see how we were doing. This place was a pleasant surprise that was also convenient to our hotel."}
{"text":"I'll say it, I like Nacho Daddy. Come at me bro.   Look, we are all adults here. Nacho Daddy is a novelty joint with the name \"Nacho Daddy\"- what is up with these negative reviews that are like \"the menu is primarily nachos, not a lot of variety\". Um, that's not a problem with the menu, the problem is you suck.   Things I have had that are good  -Cuban. I mean, not really an actual cuban, but a good sandwich nevertheless. -Wings- shockingly good. Really good blue cheese to boot -Queso- OMG WHITE QUESO I'M SO HAPPY -Burger Nachos- basically chips, cheese, and ground beef... so 10/10 would bang -Sliders- I didn't actually get to eat any of these as my dining companion killed them all. Looked good though. -Pork Tacos- I'm not ashamed to admit these were insanely good. Caramelized onions on top, some kind of delicious sauce, pretty pretty pretty good  I have never actually been in there because I live 5 feet away and order it from postmates cause ballin, but I would assume the decor was subtle and sophisticated."}
{"text":"Great customer service from JOVANNY! Friendly, fast and funny! Cool place to try out for different types of NACHOS!"}
{"text":"The food is really pricey and just ok. But this is Vegas and I guess that is to be expected. What I didn't like was the waitress telling a customer she got in trouble for not ringing his beer up and as he's leaving he's trying to pay her. She then proceeded to have a conversation with the manager that she used her too money to pay it. All the while we were waiting. When she finally came to take out order she of course was upset and made us feel uncomfortable. As if we were bothering her trying to place our order. We almost didn't stay but we were hungry. Needless to say mediocre food and bad service."}
{"text":"This was my first time to order take out from this restaurant. It was in walking distance from my hotel and I wanted to see what the hype was with these nachos. I ordered the vegan nachos and I am truly impressed. You would never know that it was dairy free either. That's what was so mind boggling. Definitely an experience worth trying. I was convinced."}
{"text":"Kiel is extremely friendly and awesome if you stop in. I highly recommend stopping by if you are in town. The food is delicious and more then generous with the portions!"}
{"text":"Food was decent here, we got the Nacho Average Burger Nachos. The Nachos were good, the meat and seasoning really did taste like a burger! Was relatively inexpensive in comparison to the majority of the strip.   Only downside was that it took 15mins for someone to come initially touch base with the table."}
{"text":"My food was really good. Just a few things though: 1. The quac was saltless 2. The chips are really salty 3. The rice is salty as well 4. The local wild life (birds) are annoying Other than these things great food"}
{"text":"walked out ! called order for pick up & apparently - no one bothered to make it ?!?!.......,,,,,..........,,, not coming here ever!  thought id give them a try"}
{"text":"Come hungry...the portions are huge for what they are. Thankfully it was a late meal of the day and I walked away super full, however, this set the pace for the rest of the afternoon and well into the evening. I had some basic tacos veggie and chicken and some sides. Prices are very reasonable and the people working there were beyond friendly and polite. Enough seating inside."}
{"text":"Tried this place for something different.  Like some other reviews, don't waste tour money.  Very overpriced for what you get.  The service was good..the food, not bad but there are other great options for less.  Most likely great for some drinks and overpriced appetizers."}
{"text":"Would like say Alex M is a wonderful person and an amazing waiter. He cares!!!  He went above above and beyond.   Thank you Alex"}
{"text":"Great service! Jake was awesome and very helpful with the menu options. Great atmosphere and most of all great food. The music and at atmosphere is really cool and relaxed. The menu has a variety of options to include an entire page of vegan options. The female restroom needed a little TLC, one sink was broken, the lighting was dim and stall doors are old and worn."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious!! went in there with low expectations and was blown away, the nachos were so good! and my carne asada burrito was awesome! make sure you get the free margarita with a yelp check-in. It was a pretty strong drink *buzzed*"}
{"text":"I was visiting the area and met a local friend here for lunch. It was easy to find, a short walk from any hotel in the heart of the strip. The service was excellent and the food was equally as good. I am a nacho lover and was very impressed with the variety of flavors available. The portions were huge, plenty to share. My only complaint, is that there is not a Nacho Daddy where I live in East Tennessee. I will definitely look forward to eating here on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing here. The prices are a little bit up there but the the portions are huge too and quality is good. We usually order to go but decided to sit in and have their famous Margaritas. Upon arrival service started great, the staff got us settled in and our order came on time. It's never busy but. . . . they kinda forgot about us after serving us our main meal. We waited for service then we just got over it and finished our food with nothing to drink, especially when your food is really spicy you'd figure they make their rounds of service. Ive tried a lot of their dishes and never disappointing, they watch from a distance to see if your done, which is lame hahahaa oher than that 5 stars for FOOD and Margaritas are great!"}
{"text":"I was told about this place by a friend who said this was the best thing she had. Like OMG! Good. Well my wife and I didn't think so. I thought it was okay and I could've made some better nachos. If I do go again I would probably try something from the Vegetarian/Vegan options, I do like that it has this option and plenty of them. I wanted to get a shot but not for $20 and then another $10 for a scorpion No Thanks I'll just get one from my back yard and buy a bottle for less."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a late night snack. Met with very friendly hostess. Server was very accommodating we had the enchilada nachos with both green and red sauce chicken by the way. Excellent flavor. Very filling. Manager even stopped by to check on usgreat Vegas spot"}
{"text":"The nachos were really good especially the white queso w jalapeno! The atmosphere was cool and happening. The only thing was the service it was slow, hence the 4 stars. The waitress didn't come by and my water never got refilled."}
{"text":"Never have I ever stepped into a restaurant and felt so alive. Las Vegas has that affect on people, simply just walking the strip is electrifying and come 2:00AM, we realize that our stomachs weren't having as good of a time as we were - they were hollering at us, saying, \"we need food, dude!\" So, as we took the corner, we noticed there was a Buffalo Wild Wings and a Nacho Daddy. Of course, we've eaten at BWW before but never heard of Nacho Daddy and so we decided to take the dive and try it. We're happy we did.  The second we walked in, we were greeted by a gentleman by the name of Jacob. Jacob was our server and aside from wielding what was the world's greatest mustache, he also had an incredible personality, was welcoming and not for a second did we feel unappreciated. We took advantage of the free house margarita by checking into Yelp and it honestly was one of the best margaritas I've ever had. I've had a lot in my days on Earth and honestly can say Nacho Daddy takes the cake for the best tequila ever. Aside from the margaritas, the nachos were bomb. It was as if God himself cooked our meal for us. Not a dry chip on the plate as advertised. I had the Crab & Lobster nachos which I treated myself to with my winnings from the Bellagio (thank you Mr. Bellagio) and it was incredible. We also tried a chicken sandwich and some other nachos which were also really, really, really, really (x250 really) good. Service, atmosphere, food, it was all a 6 star experience. Yep, you read it here first... 6 stars, not 5. Pricing? It was reasonable considering we were on The Strip so there are no complaints there either!  All in all, it was incredible and it's ashamed we are leaving this afternoon because we would have been back tonight for some more margaritas and nachos. And this is for you Jacob, if you ever read this, you keep on doing what you're doing. You earned every cent of that tip we left for you and there is no doubt in the world you deserve a raise. Never lose your stripes, kid.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Good, reasonably priced food on the strip. Technically it's half a block from Las Vegas Blvd. on Harmon. We had the Fiesta Nachos and the Mexican corn on the cob. Very delicious. Shredded chicken and we chose the hot salsa. They will customize your nachos. Corn was fantastic. Margaritas were very good. We sat at the bar and the bartender was great. It's a big bar so service can take slightly longer if there is only one bartender but really can't complain.  All I can say is go there you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy has a really good vibe and cool decorations. Got the Supreme tostada nachos and it was a pretty big portion. Super yummy!"}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy, is your quintessential Vegas experience when you walk in. Tarantulas (correction actually Scorpions), 90s hip-hop music videos, lots of skull decor, and drunk people. Get beyond Ed Hardy facade and Nacho Daddy actually has a beautiful soul.  Yes they have Nachos, but there are many cheesy mexi options for your face. Everything from Spicy shrimp nachos to vegan quesadillas.  The portions would make Guy Feiri blush. Any place that can hold down a respectable greasy and delicious bar menu and still do a good job of creating delicious vegan/vegetarian/gluten free options deserves respect. But here is the kicker for every meal sold, they help feed less fortunate people in Vegas. Their slogan is \"Never a dry chip.\" Let me ad \"Or a dry eye.\" Keep doing the good work Nacho Daddy!"}
{"text":"I normally like nacho daddy. Was just here last Saturday for the Knights game and was given 20% off my bill and a free shot for every goal for wearing my knights gear. It's their known special during the games. Its even mentioned on Facebook. Today I wasn't even acknowledged when I sat at the bar for quite some time. It was less busy today than it was last Saturday too. I had to ask her if she forgot about me. No free shots and no 20% off the bill either. I asked about the discounted bill and she said she didn't know anything about it and would have to ask her manager. She ended up giving it to me but when I nicely said to her \"they didn't tell you about the discount?\", she said that some managers give the special and some don't and seemed irritated with me. Really? Nacho daddy Summerlin I think you need to step it up. Very disappointed. At least the food was good."}
{"text":"Damn this place is good. Arieanna was an awesome waitress and made some great recommendations. Had a huge jalapeño marg with some bacon and egg enchiladas. Perfect hangover cure. Will definitely be back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Omgee! I underestimated the quality of this place, when my girlfriend told me in Cali that we needed to eat here. When we arrived I was still a little unsure but the free Margarita for checking in began to reel me. The enchilada nachos are now a Las Vegas Favorite for me. Great for 2 or 3 people."}
{"text":"I was lucky to arrive here at 5:45pm so just made happy hour. On the recommendation of the waitress (or was she a bartender) I got the chicken street tacos. Super tasty and at 3 for $5, you can't go past them.  Will have to come back for the nachos!"}
{"text":"The nachos were amazing. Definitely recommended to also order their margarita, made a very nice pair with the nachos."}
{"text":"I went here with my coworkers to unwind and enjoy good food. The food was good, the drinks were good, atmosphere is good. Going by my review everything would be good, right? Not so much.  Our food and drinks were served in a timely manner. This is where it goes downhill, Our server checked in on us once during our meal vs checking in after we had finished our meals. The ice in our waters had melted. We had finished our meals 45 minutes. So thinking by seeing empty plates one would check on us? Nope, we can understand letting your patrons eat their meals, but we were forgotten. Every server walked by us and didn't have the courtesy to let their fellow server know their table was done. We got a servers attention and requested to speak with the manager.   I guess to help \"apologize\" for being forgotten we were given a \"free drink\" voucher with a purchase of an entree and $4 off our meal. Having worked in the industry, it could've been resolved better."}
{"text":"Really liked this place! Would recommend to anyone. After a long night of drinking, I definitely needed a good Bloody Mary. Could of used a little more vodka in it but the flavor was still good. Chips were fresh. We had queso with ground beef as a app, then the bbq nachos and the philly queso cheese steak. All was delicious. My only complaint is there was a bit to much bbq sauce on the nachos. Huge portion. Could definitely share with another person."}
{"text":"I thought the price for the fish tacos was ridiculous but when they brought it out it was so worth it. They were giant and super yummy. I would order it again   Tried the crab and lobster nachos and it was just aite. Would not order again   Filet mignon nachos were super yummy. Would order again.   Plus free margaritas with every entree order when you check in with yelp. CANT BEAT IT"}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy was decent not the best food but it was good. Reason I'm giving this only 3 stars is because the SERVICE here is God awful. Our server hardly came to our table and everytime we would ask if something was good she would say no and say get this instead and it's the most expensive item. Everytime we were ordering she did it. When we ordered appetizers she basically said don't get that and get this and the price difference would be 10 dollars. I'm not cheap and I understand up selling but don't throw huge up sells at your tables constantly when their ordering. Food good. Service bad."}
{"text":"I frequented this place solely for trivia nights, but now they don't even have those, so I definitely won't be back. Service was always 50-50. Oddly, I never had a good female server, but the men were pretty decent. I have no idea why here was a gap in gender and service, but it was consistent. The food was so-so, and the orders were wrong many, many times. We'd ask for something to NOT be on a nacho dish, and it'd come out covered in it. I once had to send a burger back after ordering it medium-well only to have it arrive completely raw in the middle. When I got another burger after a 20 minute wait, it was raw in the middle AGAIN. The server was really nice and got it taken off my bill, but it was still just really shitty of the kitchen staff to not pay attention to orders, and it happened on multiple occasions.   It's located right next to a big shopping centre with a ton of quality restaurants, so I don't know why anyone would choose Nacho Daddy over Bachi Burger or Settebello or Archi's, especially now that there isn't trivia to lure people in the doors."}
{"text":"Went there and excited to try their food since it was highly recommended by a friend. Sat there for over 15 minutes  just to get up acknowledge by the server. No one even opted to get our drink orders. Got a little irritated and walked out. Poor poor service for being a new customer. Even if you are  short staff they can least have taking our drink order right away."}
{"text":"What a fun restaurant! The atmosphere is great (music videoa playing on the TV's) and the food lived up to our expectations. We ordered the Taco Supreme Nachos and they were awesome! We weren't sure if we were hungry enough for entrees so my husband and I decided to split tacos... I am glad we did! They were really good. The only reason I am not giving a full five stars is the service could have been better. It wasn't miserable but our server was not very attentative."}
{"text":"Food was ok for a quick last minute decision. At the end of the day I would say the queso was probably my favorite part. Cabo Wabo that we have traditionally went to for years would be a better decision food wise as well as location even though there literally around the corner from each other"}
{"text":"Thank you Nacho Daddy for offering vegan & vegetarian options! Always friendly wait staff, award winning drinks, amazing desserts & always great food ! #vegan #vegetarian"}
{"text":"One of the best places in vegas i have been too. Our server was awesome and provided us amazing customer service. She even provided us with must try vegetarian items and asked us to try chicken substitute and i must say it was delicious. I would recommend any vegetarian to try this place."}
{"text":"It is located around the corner from Planet Hollywood!! The nachos seemed very yummy and so my friend and I decided to give it a try. We happened to walked in during happy hour and so we ate the things off the happy hour menu. The regular nachos is a large portion so perfect for    sharing. The margaritas were very yummy. Definitely a spot to check out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great authentic food that taste delicious. Large servings, so make sure your hungry. The nachos plate is big enough for 2-3 people to share. And the chicken tortitia soup is so good, I highly recommend it. There's so much chicken swimming around, the soup is full meal by it self. Definitely a go-to restaurant when in Vegas. Those restaurants on the strip with same price range dont even come close. More bang for your buck$. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered the Daddy's Bowl delicious with the wild rice ( differently tasty ), black beans, garlic sauce and cheeses, was extra hungry so had it with the filet mignon. Delicious!   Husband had the enchilada chicken plate, super tasty .  We did a carry out and there was problem, when my husband returned to correct it, the manager was SUPER, he comped our bill.  A++++ we were so impressed.  Food and service was great. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Amazing service, fresh ingredients, and a great atmosphere- what's not to love! I have been here twice so far; once for a hosted event and once for a weekend lunch. Their menu has something for everyone, including more than half a page dedicated to real, fulfilling and creative VEGAN options! The avocado tacos are heavenly.   Like their namesake suggests, they are taking your average plate of nachos over the top with unique interpretations of familiar flavors. My favorite nacho option is the Thai Chicken nacho- full of the classic Thai flavors but with a Tex Mex essence.   Their drink menu is also impressive, with high quality, amazingly fresh margaritas; you can watch them squeeze the limes fresh at the bar! We tried the house, blood orange, Daddy's, and spicy cucumber margaritas- all delicious! If you're feeling extra brave, you can attempt their signature scorpion shot!   This location may be in the center of The Strip, but has all of the welcoming atmosphere and service you'd expect from a local restaurant and the pride in their Vegas roots shows. From the managers, bartenders and servers, they spend so much time connecting with guests and expediently sharing top notch Mexican offerings with locals and tourists alike. Definitely a stand out option for a laid back lunch or dinner any day in Vegas."}
{"text":"I would definitely consider myself a nacho expert. If there are ever nachos to be had, I will always chose them over any other appetizer, hands down. I would like to thank Nacho Daddy for their large vegan menu! There were a lot of really great options. We had the sweetest waitress, Ryan. She was great!  She let us know that her favs off the vegan menu were the Loaded Nachos and the Spicy Burrito. Done and done! When the order came, it looked SO good... we dug right in. A few bites in, I was questioning my entire life. I'm always such a paranoid freak when it comes to eating vegan at a non-vegan restaurant because people are humans and mistakes happen, but I'm not trying to realize it at the end of the meal. I had to ask Ryan to re-confirm for my insane mind that these delicious nachos were vegan, because the cheese tasted like straight up OG nacho cheese. It was definitely vegan but I feel like it would fool a non-vegan any day! I would add chikn to it next time, just to further my pigdom. The burrito was really flavorful! They somehow marinated the chikn to perfection and it actually held up a nice texture, unlike when I try to marinade chikn at home. If you are vegan and in Vegas, you have to try this place."}
{"text":"The next time you're on the Vegas strip... If you're vegan and craving Mexican food, I highly recommend Nacho Daddy.  They offer a wonderful selection of options! Try the vegan queso. It is fantastic. The fried chik'n chimichanga is great, also!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The sweet chili  chicken nachos were okay. Don't understand all the hype. They forgot to add the jalapeños  and there were only three chunks of chicken."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to come for nachos! Best nachos in Las Vegas. We always have great service. Tonight we had Brianna and she was blast. She made our dinner excellent while we cheered on the Knights!! Go Knights!"}
{"text":"First time, and definitely the last. Service was incredibly slow, food greasy, and atmosphere not appealing. I would recommend implementing a training program for all of their employees to at least show them how to 'act' like they care."}
{"text":"Slightly tucked away off the beaten path. Nacho daddy is a great spot for those who want to take a moment off the busyness of the strip but just a hop,skip and jump away.   I Was able to enjoy my breakfast on their patio with a great view with mild quietness from the strip. The strip is maybe 100 ft or so..?  I had the breakfast burrito which was great, added some guac. The coffee is a allstar as it comes in a French press. Service was also spectacular. Great breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good! Their nacho game is truly on point. Plus they have happy hours & check-in deals which is very unusual for any restaurant on the strip.  Filet mignon burrito is super legit but you must actually order it medium-rare or else they may over cook it.   Service is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food with comfortable and upscale environment. Drinks are even better. Live scorpion tank as you walk in."}
{"text":"Nacho best choice for a Mexican restaurant in Vegas . There are better ones out there.   Disappointing... I ordered ceviche and it was full of mostly chopped onion & hardly any shrimp. They charge for chips and salsa, even if you order a meal, which is goofy. They seemed to try to hurry us out and brought the bill quickly. Our bill for two people was over 40 bucks and we didn't have any drinks. I left hungry. The food server and hosts were very friendly and the salsa is good. That's about it.   If you want a better Mexican restaurant go to Lindo Michoacan, Juan's Flaming Fajitas or even Ricardo's."}
{"text":"When you're at Nacho Daddy, you have to try the nachos!   Came in on a Saturday afternoon and we were quickly greeted by the hostess. Upon entering there were basketballs and hoops located on the back walls, my boys were entertained. There was no wait so we were seated right away.   Our server was very friendly and helpful, since it was our first time she made recommendations.  Items ordered: -Fiesta Chicken Nachos ($14.95) - Spicy Shrimp Nachos ($15.95) - 2 chicken tenders and fries kids meals ($6 each?)  Our order came out quick and the food looked delicious, although, it wouldn't hurt them to add more fries to the kids meals. The plates looked bare and my boys finished the fries in a matter of minutes. The fiesta chicken nachos were really good and came topped with refried beans, salsa, queso fresco, sour cream, and guacamole. My favorite were the spicy shrimp nachos, although, they don't really live up to their name since they only have a small kick. The tortilla chips are jalapeno chips, they're topped off with monterey jack cheese, jalapenos, diablo sauce, tomatoes, and cilantro. Everything was very delicious and our meal with drinks came out to a little over $50, so it was inexpensive for 4 of us to dine in.   Food was good, atmosphere was pleasant, our server was on top of everything, we never had to wait on refills and she constantly checked up on us so excellent service on her behalf."}
{"text":"We had the breakfast burrito delivered to our hotel, it was delicious and huge, enough for two breakfasts. Great value compared to the crappy hotel fare."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They have the best vegan nachos I have ever had!!!!! Their deep fried avocado tacos were ok. Nothing special. But go for their tacos. Incredible!!"}
{"text":"Came in with a party of 18 on a slow day...they wouldn't serve us water until everyone was sitting down..there was 16 from the beginning...Waiter was extremely rude..So we asked to see the manager and he was worse than the staff...We complain to him about his waiter and he said if we didn't like it we can leave...Worse place I've ever been to and experience!!!! The whole staff should get fired on how they made my family feel...lt was my grandmother's 89th birthday and she picked this place because she gets a kick out of the commercial and to her surprise they treated us like our money wasn't green...."}
{"text":"Food is so amazing and always fills me up without a doubt. Jovanni is really one of the best waiters I've experienced at a Nacho Daddy. Plan to some back again"}
{"text":"I absolutely love nachos and this place is NOT it. We got the lobster and crab nachos and it was not good.  Had barely any cheese on it and we thought the meat would be chunks of meat but it was more like pureed meat.  I thought the cheese quesadilla would be safe to order but it was just okay.  Again... barely any cheese.  We also go the wings, which the husband liked as well as the margaritas.  Our server/bartender Sierra was sweet though.  Would not come back."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is that you?   This Nacho Daddy is located inside the Miracle Mile Shops outside. To get here you have to walk about halfway through the shops, and then follow the signs for Harmon Street Restaurants. Then you go outside and walk a bit further and you will find it. It's next to BWW and Hot N Juicy. Not sure if there is anywhere closer to park, but it's quite a distance from the parking garage.   I met a friend here at 5:30p on a Tuesday. It was pretty quiet, yet it took a while for our server to approach our table. When she finally showed up, she was upbeat and friendly. She explained some specials to us and recommended a few items as well. We both got white peach margs on the rocks, which were good, although I feel like mine was a bit heavy handed on the sweet n sour. It was happy hour (3-6 weekdays) and tequila shots were only $4, so maybe add a shot if you like it a little stronger.  As for the food, it was nothing to write home about. It really tasted like Taco Bell, but with strip prices. We split an order of filet mignon nachos, and fried avocado tacos. The nachos come with beans, cheese, filet mignon, guacamole, pico, and sour cream. We asked for the pico on the side as it had jalapenos in it, but still the nachos were pretty spicy. I believe it was the ranchero sauce that was over powering and took away from any of the other flavors. The tacos were also spicy and I couldn't even really tell I was eating avocado. I was disappointed because my friend had raved about them, and we both really just thought they were meh. All in all, I would say that this is a one and done for me."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite. The food was amazing and our waitress Kristen was so nice and attentive. She did a very good job taking care of us. Our food came out a little late, which we didn't even notice and Kristen provided us an update and let us know that they had discounted our meal because of the delay. Thank you for the wonderful food and great customer service."}
{"text":"To put it simply- those nachos was good! The service is great food came out quickly. The fajitas were good too! Happy to finally cross this off my Las Vegas bucket list finally. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"First timer here at Nacho Daddy been wanting to come in but never made the time. So decided to come in here with some friends after church. Was greeted by this cute server who introduced herself as Daria, Darla one or the other. She was very bubbly and personable and funny. To start off had a casa migos shot of tequila to get the taste buds going than ordered a dogfish IPA to sip. You know what hey say. Liquor before beer your in the clear. Than for appetizers our table started with the triple dip, and sizzling shrimp. For my entree I had the shrimp and steak fajita and my ___ that shizz was bomb dot com. Definitely a great first time experience. Would recommend this place. Thanks to our server for not being one of those boring order takers and making our experience a great one."}
{"text":"What an amazing place!  I've passed by this restaurant so many times thinking I'll have to try it sometime. I wish I had stopped sooner! The selections are numerous and everyone at the table was pleased with their choice! They even have a great selection of veggie entrees if that's whats you are craving. I tried the Chimichanga with filet and a Nacho Daddy Margarita. Both were fantastic!!   Normally I take it easy on the appetizer to save room for the main meal, but not this time, they were so good.  Our waiter Brian made some suggestions and we're glad we listened.  The order was placed and out came the drinks and appetizer just minutes later.   The inside of the restaurant is loaded with big screen TVs with a great mix of entertainment that will have you looking up to see the action while enjoying the great food.   If you are looking for a place to try out for the first time or to return again and again, I would highly recommend Nacho Daddy!  Great friendly service, great location, fantastic food and drinks!  what more do I need to say,  I'll be coming back here often."}
{"text":"Just came in to have sit down lunch, walkin, bar empty, 3 tables when i sat down, 2 when i left, both tables were waited on while i was there. Sat for 10 mins with no server saying hi.. i left. On the way out, both servers standing there talking..WOW!!"}
{"text":"I just had the most incredible time at the bar here with Arnold and Booker! I brought my friend mclovin and he was a huge hit with the staff! Such charismatic and caring service, will definently be visiting again! Thanks nacho daddy!!"}
{"text":"I got the bbq pulled pork nachos, cheese enchiladas and the corn off the cob. The food was delicious although I was extremely disappointed about the amount of corn they gave you for seven dollars. It was literally 3 tablespoons of corn. Definitely won't buy that again. Other than that very pleased with the taste of my food."}
{"text":"Great food, great service from Sarah.  Excellent breakfast taco and French Press coffee. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious vegan options! We ordered the Kale Salad and the Loaded Nachos (both vegan) - the kale salad was REALLY fresh and had a nice light dressing (maybe vinegar, sugar, lime, chili seasoning?). The vegan nachos were totally awesome and nobody would ever know they were vegan. I'm thrilled. Also our server, Ryan, was really friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"So glad they opened a new location.. The other locations went to crap and closed down so I was really excited to see a fresh new one. The food was amazing. Service was great. Thai Chicken Nachos are my FAVORITE... Great meeting spot for people on the strip too. This will be my go-to spot when friends come to town!"}
{"text":"Yelp check in for the win! Your Yelp check in gets you a tasty margarita, so that started things out on the right note for me. Overall, an enjoyable experience. I didn't see any booths, which I find odd in a restaurant, but it was all good. Our server (I wish I caught his name), was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, even the vegan options (not for me, heavens no, but for our vegan friend). I actually sampled the vegan chicken nachos and they were very tasty!   I had the lobster and crab enchiladas, and requested no beans, double rice on the side. This is where things got dicey. First they came with the beans. No biggie, they took them back and replaced them with rice. Our server was clearly annoyed that the kitchen didn't follow his order. Then I requested guacamole (an extra $1.00). I received it, then another came! He was definitely annoyed, but I got 2 for the price of 1, so I was happy.   The enchiladas were tasty, but definitely not the most filling. I'm glad I had the rice, otherwise, I'd have been hungry leaving.  Everything else was good to go, and no wait on a Tuesday evening. I kinda think they need a happy hour though!"}
{"text":"Do you love Vegas? Do you love nachos? Do you have a mixed vegan/meat eating family? Ok maybe you don't have to be that specific, but that's me and my husband and we love this place!!  Bartender Rebekah was amazing, food was delicious, environment is fun and funky.  My husband got the Knights nachos and I, after soul searching due to the entire page of vegan options I had to choose from, went for the loaded vegan nachos, bc nachos are my FAVE cheat food. We loved our meals and thanks to Yelp I got a free margarita. Win/Win!"}
{"text":"It was ok had street tacos and corn. Tacos were ok but corn was was ovet covered with seasoning. Bartenders were very friendly though. We used to go to the one in Green Valley all the time loved it till they closed it down it was far superior to this one."}
{"text":"Was just OK.  Not terribly authentic. Pork taco was good.  Chicken enchilada was passable but dull."}
{"text":"Best Nachos ever!!! My son and I love this place. Great service and super cool atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Walked in and we were greeted by a miserable looking kid. He told us it was a 5 to 10 minute wait. We sat down near the fireplace and he said it might take longer. Not something you want to hear when you are greeted. We sat down about 10 minutes later and ordered immediately. The server was nice but he never really checked up on us. He was focused on 2 other tables that were a bit larger. We had to flag him down for water and condiments. It was hard enough to just get his attention with music blasting.  The food was between del Taco and Robertos.  That's the only honest description I can think of. I opted for the queso dip and chips and quesadilla. My husband ordered the burrito, which was huge, but nothing phenomenal. The queso dip was made out of real cheese, but that was the only dish that stood out. The kids had nachos and Mac and cheese, so, that too was mediocre.  I don't think I will come back here anytime soon, maybe for the happy hour. Maybe I will update my review then."}
{"text":"After entering the restaurant, we were welcomed in with smiling faces and our wonderful server and supervisor Jovany was such a caring and welcoming person. I felt accepted and flattered by his sweet choice of words. Their portions are great as well which makes it much better & their prices are nice for the strip. Hello from Turkey ! Love you guys !!!"}
{"text":"This place is soooo yummy! Love it. If you have a with you this is good for you and a meet eater."}
{"text":"Ok. This is easy. I have attached the reason why happy hour at this place is a FUCKING JOKE! I had the buffalo chicken nachos. Disgusting ranch buffalo sauce with crispy bits of gross costco stle un edible pits if chicken topped with celery and mushrooms??? Ugh..one bite of this mess ruined my pallet. I payed for my overpriced beer and went to the the lazy dog. Now This is a happy hour paradise. Food and drink and prices are off the hook!! I was so excited to try nacho daddys. Bad food, prices and atmosphere. Live and learn!!"}
{"text":"Good food at an affordable price. Nacho plates large enough for 2-3 people to share. Fast service and polite staff."}
{"text":"Nacho daddy is probably one of my all-time favorite Mexican restaurants in the city. They have super delicious Mexican food with tons of options for vegans which is honestly a little rare. Having a full piece in the menu for vegans and vegetarians is really exciting. Their margaritas and happy hour always make for a good time. I absolutely love both locations but prefer the downtown location because of how close it is to where I live but both have really good food"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have a scorpion tank when you walk in and they even have a scorpion shot (alcohol shot with real scorpion at the bottom... dead of course)! The service was great and the bartenders made my night! I got the filet mignon nachos. They were a little too spicy for me and not enough meat, but it was delicious. The bartender (Booker) made me an awesome Jameson cocktail and was super friendly and entertaining. The atmosphere is chill and the decor was cool. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was one my go to places while I visited Las Vegas. The best nachos I've had. The environment was a bit noisy, waitress was great, service was quick, and was inexpensive."}
{"text":"I'm totally underwhelmed by the food. Everything is bland. Margs yech. Service ok. We had nachos and seafood combo - nothing was spicy unless you threw a jalapeño on it. No complex flavors. Even the salsa was kind of dull."}
{"text":"The filet mignon nachos were bomb! We also had the crab and lobster nachos but I didn't enjoy those as much.  There's also a yelp check in deal here to get a free margarita with purchase of an entree, and they didn't limit us. It was per entree basically, so two entree's, two  margaritas.  We also got a free birthday dessert, and since it was Tuesday, it was also BOGO Tequila shots! Our server was even awesome enough to let us buy it for him and his colleagues, so we all took shots together. All in all, a fun experience with the people of Las Vegas.  I would gladly come back again for some more filet mignon nachos. We were at Top Golf earlier this trip and had their nachos, they weren't horrible, but Nacho Daddy's were far better (and they better be with this kind of name...)."}
{"text":"This place is great if you love nachos and you're hungry. Portions so I would even recommend sharing a few items. I believeI had the all American nachos and my God-sister got the fajitas with steak. I couldn't finish and it was pretty good and indulgent. The steak on the fajitas were meh at best. Overall great place to chill watch a good hockey game:-)"}
{"text":"bad ass vegan options!!!!!! everything we had was awesome!!! keep it rad guys thanks!!!"}
{"text":"This is the first time at this location. Wife and I had the unlimited chips and salsa. We also shared the filet mignon nachos and had a couple of iced teas. Total was not bad $30. And a full stomach.   I will come again!"}
{"text":"A nice decent respectable spot.First time in Begas since i was 12, and was semi-astounded by the overall Idiocrasy-ness of Vegas overall, but the food here wasnt bad. Was granted a free marg via yelp check-in upon arrival and enjoyed that, as well as a defent cadillac marg serving which i ordered.Food was aight, not half bad to say the least. Do the fajitas or the nachos, get fuct up, enjoy your time on the strip!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but not worth the price.  I ended up paying around $17 for 3 fish tacos, chips with salsa and water.  I know plenty of great Mexican restaurants for nearly half the price.  $2.50 for chips and salsa??"}
{"text":"So-so nachos.   So given that the name implied that nachos were their specialty, I was expecting a great foodie experience. Unfortunately, after spending $20 on one order of filet mignon nachos, we realized (like many places in the strip area) that this place was nothing more than another tourist trap. The filet was over cooked and tough (which is the opposite of why you buy a filet to begin with) and it was covered in an awful salsa. Had the salsa been left off, the nachos would have been better. We also ordered chicken tortilla soup. It was supposed to come with chicken breast, however the chicken was left off but our server quickly corrected the error.   Overall, the food was good, I just wouldn't recommend spending top dollar on the filet nachos, and I would ask for the salsa to be left on the side."}
{"text":"The service was acceptable. Refills were a little slow, but I can deal with that. The food was not good. When nachos are supposed to come with cheese and cheese sauce I should notice the cheese. There was very little cheese and none of the sauce. On top of that my nachos came with a surprise heap of black beans. I've never had black beans with Mexican food so this was a surprise, and unfortunately I do not like black beans. My daughter ordered the mac n cheese off of the kids menu. The bowl was not large, and was about a third full. I had to feed her again when we got home. It was probably about 5 ounces of mac n cheese, literally. I tried the nachos that my wife ordered, they were okay but also lacked cheese. I was hoping that this would be what I hoped for, but it isn't. We likely won't return. Also the prices were a little high."}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelp reviews and I wasn't disappointed. The bartender was really nice and engaging and she didn't skimp on the alcohol in the drinks. Lol. I don't remember the nachos we got but they were really good and recommended to us by the bartender. The portions are big so it was more than enough for 2 people to share.   It's a little off the strip so there wasn't really anyone in there but that wasn't a problem for me. I would recommend this place if you love nachos and a good drink without the busy Vegas crowds."}
{"text":"This place is overrated in every way, food, service, price and portions. Why are we paying outrageous  prices for a little cheese, meat (if any) chips. I could appreciate it if the food was tasty. But it's  not, it was bland. And I'm being kind. This establishment will stay as long as people continue to support it. The Mcdonalds of Nachos!! Oh & they don't  give you chips & salsa! I will NOT be back. Should be Baby Nacho ijs."}
{"text":"Awesome Nachos! I would recommend this place for any nacho lovers! My buddy loves nachos and I had to take him here. We ordered the filet mignon nachos and he was impressed. The portion is quite large, but I'm not sure if the price fits the bill. There are tons of different nacho options. I wish there was one closer to home."}
{"text":"Great spot with fair prices. Ordered the pulled pork nachos and wings. Both were great, nachos were better and they didn't skimp on the pork!"}
{"text":"Just to get this out of the way: Nacho Daddy is not \"great\" Mexican food. It is GOOD Mexican food that tastes much better when you're drunk or hungover ^_^   However, their service is wonderful, the margaritas are delicious, and prices are cheap compared to other stuff on the strip. They're a very convenient stumble from Planet Hollywood and surrounding hotels."}
{"text":"Visiting from LA have heard nothing but great things about this place. The food was everything we hoped and more, the service however was some of the worst I've ever received. In the span of over an hour we saw our waitress 5 times total and We only got our drinks refilled once(after multiple requests). When we wanted the check she was no where to be found. We tell the hostess \"we can't find her and we'd like our check split\" and she tells us to tell our server. So then we flagged someone else to get our waitress to get our check. Our server was Hazelynne I'd say avoid her section but we saw another server waiting to finish her texts before she brought put people food. So I can't imagine any of the other servers are any good. Very disappointing because the food is excellent to bad there's no standards for customer service."}
{"text":"Ask for Alexander he's the best!!! Such great customer service!! Delicious food and an amazingly huge Vegan menu. I recommend the vegan loaded nachos. Their margaritas are the best too! Great place to watch the Golden Knights game. Such a fun atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  The place was packed and service was lacking a little."}
{"text":"I had a good meal at Nacho Daddy's. When I sat down with the group I was greeted with a glass of Ice cod water garnished with a lemon, and I soon ordered a Dos Equis Lager, both did not last longWhen it came to to order I took the Taco Tuesday Special the Carne Asada Taco's. When they arrived they were goodwith the Carne Asada and the onions. In all it was a very good meal."}
{"text":"We were in Las Vegas last weekend and stumbled upon this amazing restaurant.  They have delicious margaritas and the food is outstanding.  Our servers Booker and Shannon were fantastic!!!  I am hoping they open one up in the Houston/Katy Texas area!!!!  Do yourself a favor and check out this restaurant.  You sure don't want to miss out on the terrific service and wonderful food!!!  We will return the next time we are in Vegas!!  Mark and Brenda Denker Katy, TX."}
{"text":"FIVE FREAKING STARS!!!!   First of all, our server LAUREN was absolutely adorable! Beautiful, attentive, funny, and had the chillest personality. Second of all, I came here for the VEGAN NACHOS. Let's just talk about this really quick. Vegan. Nachos. Do I need to say much more? I do? Okay, let me continue. They are vegan, and gluten free, and DELICIOUS! The portion is huge and so is the FLAVA! I would recommend this restaurant to any one with food restrictions or allergies like my self. The FULL vegan menu and the crazy list of tequila options are... LIFE CHANGING. I dare you to try the scorpion shot.... I was to cowardly to do it... but it looked intense. Remember ask for LAUREN if you go. She made it worth the walk down to Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"I have to say that this place is mediocre. We saw our server 3 times. When we ordered, one time she asked if we needed anything and then when we paid. Hard to get service when you never see them. The kids eat free is cool but they only took off $4.99 not $7.99 which was my daughters dinner. I guess it's $3 for chicken and that's not free. It's a deceptive way to market. The fajitas were bland and I don't understand why a Mexican restaurant doesn't offer salsa. It's like ketchup at a hamburger joint. My last frustration...why charge $3.99 for chips and salsa. It's such a common thing to give out. It's terrible they charge. Really??? $60 and we get nickel and dimed. I try to support local owned places but this is not a way to win over a family."}
{"text":"I love nachos and I'm always wanting to try new nacho combos and different restaurants.   My husband was excited to take me here and I was excited too.   I really hate to say this but I was extremely disappointed in the food. It was nothing special at all. For the price I was expecting some WOW nachos. But unfortunately I've had better nachos elsewhere. Infact I can make way better nachos. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great menu selection for vegans super happy with all the food. Ordered too much  but enjoyed the whole experience! Great margaritas too!"}
{"text":"Just ok.  Got the Fiesta Nachos and good but more soggy than crisp.  Service was good.  Probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"In short, this place has super cool vibes, awesome service & ABSOLUTELY AMAZING FOOD!   Our group (7 people) initially stopped by around 12:00pm on Saturday but was told it was a 45 min wait. We dropped by again on Sunday around the same time and was seated almost immediately (but the rush came shortly after). You could call ahead and add yourself to the waitlist.   FOOD (items I tried): - Filet Mignon Nachos: Seriously the ultimate plate of nachos. SO BOMB. The meat was incredibly tender and juicy. The sauces, cheese, and guacamole just infused together SO perfectly. I could finish one plate by myself if I were SUPER hungry, but I think it would be best for sharing. - Smothered Burrito (w/ both red and green enchilada sauces): HUGE and pretty good. You could add queso (instead of enchilada sauce) for an extra $2...but I think I prefer the red enchilada sauce. It also comes with a side of chips & salsa which we didn't end up touching because of our nachos. - Daddy's Margarita (free w/ Yelp check-in): Pretty yummy & refreshing! I noticed the frozen margaritas were A LOT stronger than the iced ones. Pick your poison.  SERVICE, ETC.: Our server was Huck & he was super great, friendly, and helpful. The food took a while to come out. But when it did, we all got our orders at the same time (though some plates weren't as hot as others).   The World Cup game was on, so the super big flat-screen TVs scattered throughout the restaurant were perfect for the occasion.  It's opened pretty late so it's PERFECT for late night drunchies.  TBH, I'd choose this place over a buffet any day. A must-try if you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The Thai Chicken Nachos are amazing. Unfortunately, they're SO good that I can't bring myself to try anything else lol!! The Triple Dip is a great starter but by the time you leave, you'll be on tortilla chip overload, unless you order something different than nachos.  Ask to be seated in Brian's section. Attentive, fast, and friendly!!"}
{"text":"The food is really good, I just wish it wasn't so expensive."}
{"text":"I came to Nacho Daddy for lunch. The food was pretty good but the service was not great. The servers were very nice but it took forever to get our food or flag our server down. And the place was no where near crowded. I would recommend if you have a lot of time to kill"}
{"text":"Awesome experience - the nachos were loaded up tall and wide with delicious ingredients (literally, what seemed like everything under the sun).  Judy was a Rock Star - delivering positively outrageous service our entire meal.  The atmosphere was chill - the perfect spot to decompress after our flight from KC.  I'd definitely revisit Nacho Daddy."}
{"text":"Jovanny was really great, friendly and very helpful. He made the visit so much better. A+++"}
{"text":"Went in here a few nights ago, so posting a little late. The food here is always good, I ordered the hot buffalo nachos (my go to).  The only reason for a 3 star review, is it took quite a long time for anyone to notice we were standing at the host stand to be seated.  Normally this wouldn't bother me even in the slightest, knowing that high volume restaurants get busy.  But as we were eating we overheard the table with sight of the front door, was full of employees there for a party, and quite a few standing at the bar who never let any of the employees on the clock know we were standing there.  A little disappointing.  But our waitress was very pleasant and quick to refill drinks."}
{"text":"Great food, fabulous breakfast menu...best salsa and pico outside of Mexico!  Arienna was a very attentive server!"}
{"text":"Great place love it!! Awesome food great service and an overall pleasant atmosphere I definitely recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Had bad experience in the past at nacho daddy however this nacho daddy is by far the best one! Our waiter Davor gave the best service we could possibly ask for, always checked in on us and provided us with great service! I would definitely ask for him if you are eating here!! Had such a good time!"}
{"text":"Great place.   Our meals were so good (very generous portions)!!!  House margarita delicious!  Service was quick and courteous, very friendly staff!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is Nacho average Nacho place! Came here twice while in Vegas for a conference. Had the Asian Chicken nachos, which sounds weird, but it works.  Interesting flavor mix.  When they say \"Never a dry chip\" they mean it!  I for one, hate a plate of nachos where half of the chips have nothing on them.  Not here folks. Second meal was the Daddy's Bowl.  Very hefty portion and good flavors. Chips and guac were pretty good, too. The peach margarita was tasty, but I'd skip their house margarita, its a bit on the sour side. Service was great.  Shout out to my server Huck!!  He's the man when it comes to providing excellent service.  He made great recommendations and took good care of me.  Happy belated birthday!"}
{"text":"The service staff was very very nice. Our food came out almost immediately.  They have an insanely good nacho/queso combo that is out of this world. The three stars are honestly for the beverage pours.  I used to be a bartender and I know a decent margarita or shot of tequila when I taste one or see one. They are a little skimpy on the alcohol and very heavy on the mixers. Also, in an environment like this, you'd think they would have a jukebox of some kind which they do not. But the ambient music is just fine.   they have indoor and outdoor seating as well as a fully stocked bar with decent sized televisions to catch news or the most current game. I definitely like this restaurant and will be returning at some point."}
{"text":"Woke up with a desire for margaritas and decided to come here.  Few more days left as a Vegas local and I couldn't leave without coming to Nacho Daddy! The Mango margarita was excellent and so were the spicy shrimp nachos .  Thanks to the bartender, Zack for the awesome recommendations!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I had the supreme toastada nacho and we took advantage of the free marg with check in. The nachos were surprisingly amassing. I didn't have very high expectations for this place but the nachos are amazing. I was worried about that I wouldn't like the avocado line salsita but i am glad the waiter told us to stick with it because it was delicious."}
{"text":"We had such a great experience at Nacho Daddy on the 4th of July! We walked in and it wasn't very busy.  Our server was VERY friendly and attentive. We ordered Mexican Churro Pancakes, Steak Chilaquiles, and Bacon-Cheese Enchiladas Rancheros. We all agreed that our breakfast was very good! We will definitely go there next time we are in town! BTW order a mimosa with breakfast super DELISH. :)"}
{"text":"Celebrating my birthday weekend in Vegas and came in and got my free Margarita with my check in but our server, Jovany hooked us up with 2! Thank you so much!  food also looks bomb!"}
{"text":"Food was ok but the margaritas were basically just cups of margarita mix with ice. I was super disappointed because the reviews raved about the margaritas here but I don't see what the hype is."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. The menu was awesome when I opened it. It wasn't too busy but our waitress was pretty slow. I gave her a free pass as we were a table of 8, and I know it's not easy. I ordered the smothered filet mignon burrito, it was 17.50. I was super excited to eat it and as I worked my way through it there wasn't much steak in it. For a $5 up charge to have the steak there seemed to be only a few nibbles and tons of rice. I think the burrito would of been a 10/10 if there was more steak in it. I'm also not totally convinced it was filet mignon either. Seemed more of a skirt steak similar to what you'd use for carne asada. It was a stringing beef. Either way, I feel like the flavor was there but it was just lacking on the beef that I paid extra for. I'd be willing to try it again though. Maybe if I'm in the area I'll give it another go."}
{"text":"Hammerred down the Churro Pancake this morning, cooked perfectly. Great service. Use the Yelp Check-In for a free beverage or margerita. Love this place.  The Breakfast Taco with bacon was nom-nom. Service was good, price great! It's all good here."}
{"text":"I got my food and drinks is less than 10min. My server was good. The best bbq chicken nachos I ever had."}
{"text":"Filet mignon Nachos are awesome. Great margaritas. Sandra at the bar was an awesome servant! I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best place for nachos I've been to. Depending on the day the service may be a little slow. But their nachos are incredible. I love the barbecue chicken ones. Plates are definitely big enough to share. House margaritas are great as well. Good atmosphere to hang out with friends! I eat here every time I'm on the strip."}
{"text":"I came in happily to be seated and recommended to go to the bar due to the happy they're having right now. I was served really quick and was impressed due to other restaurants I've been in LV. The house Margarita is really really good! I would recommend this place to people who want to get out of the sun!"}
{"text":"We chose Nacho Daddy for our special date night this month and had an absolutely amazing time.  Thanks to Scarlett I am now addicted to the Spicy Cucumber Margarita!! It was mouth watering amazing!!  I also recommend the seafood nachos sounds so strange but are actually really good!! They are a little on the sweet side so delicious everyone.  I can't wait to bring our boys back to try them.  Scarlett mentioned she was brand new but it sure didn't show.  She was a true professional with a genuine personality.  We didn't feel ever like a script was being pushed on us just a really good time!!   We will be back soon thank you Nacho Daddy!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big nacho fan so this place of course had appeal to me! I had the queso with ground beef for an appetizer and then the seafood nachos. Both were excellent (though the portions are big so it's too much food for two people to get an appetizer and each a plate of nachos). I recommend sharing if you can agree on what to get! The seafood nachos were just the right amount of sweet and spicy"}
{"text":"The street tacos were fine, the enchiladas forgettable, but this place isn't called Taco Daddy or Enchilada Daddy.  Some of the best nachos we've ever had, and we eat a lot of nachos.  The margaritas were great as well.  If you need an affordable break from the extravagant Vegas strip restaurants, or your idea of good Mexican food usually comes from a truck and doesn't have $40 plates of fish, this place might be right up your alley."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I am a nacho and taco fiend and this place just gets me. Our bartender Davor was so great!"}
{"text":"A must in Vegas for happy hour! Mini nachos, two tacos, two margaritas all for $20! Drinks were strong and tacos have a ton of chicken. My friend got the chimichangas and the dip is so good."}
{"text":"When I come to Vegas , this place is what I look forward to.  Love the nachos!!!! Everything is awesome here."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I loved the filet mignon nachos and the house margarita. I think they use pineapple in the margarita which made a huge difference! The service was also great! It's just 10 seconds off the strip, sort of behind the Planet Hollywood mall. So much better than any food in the mall! We will be returning!"}
{"text":"This was one of the places my boyfriend and I had on our list to check out for the past 2 vegas trips. We finally got the time and it definitely didn't disappoint. We got the burger nachos and the lobster and crab nachos and also was able to get a free margarita for checking in via yelp! We sat at the bar and Our server, Arnold, was one of the best bartenders we've ever had! His cool and calm demeanor makes you feel like you've known him for years! We could tell he was super busy but that didn't stop him from being attentive and answering all of our questions about the menu! We will for sure visit again. Thanks Arnold for all of your help!"}
{"text":"In Vegas for my 21st Birthday and I am so glad we were craving nachos. BEST NACHOS EVER, hands down. Every chip had a generous amount of toppings giving you the best bite every single time."}
{"text":"Perfect in every way! Great music, food proportion is pretty big, you're best off sharing :) great staff . Def coming back , def our go to ;)"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on yelp and gave it a try.  Excellent choice!  Atmosphere is a very cool industrial vibe and food and service were fantastic. I had one of their bowls - healthy, yummy and more food than I could possibly eat. Chips and salsa were delicious as well, with a nice texture and kick. Definitely recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"I like this place because it's family friendly for my 2 year old who loves the refried beans. The house margaritas are decent, too sweet for my taste. I asked for light sour mix and it's still pretty sweet. We had the new lobster and crab nachos, it was good! The kale salad was unexpectedly delicious. The next time I come back I will definitely have it again.  It's definitely not authentic Mexican food but it gets the job done."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I'm so glad that they now have one on the strip not only the Fremont Street area. I have tried about half of their nachos on the menu. Very good. I'm not exactly a fan of the BBQ pork nachos, too saucy for me, but my friend LOVED them. Good margaritas and you even get a free one when you check in on Yelp!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST nachos and fajitas!!!  Oh yeah and their margaritas are the BOMBDIGGIDY!!  Top notch service and always with a smile. You want a fun place to get out and enjoy some great food and drinks?? This is the place to be."}
{"text":"They have an entire V E G A N  menu.   Get the vegan chicken tacos  You won't be disappointed. Nachos are great too!  Not sure what kind of voodoo they used to make the faux chicken but it's incredible. The first time eating here we took a bite and had to double check it was vegan.   Only improvement I can think of..... I wish they had a vegan version of the typical refried beans and Spanish rice. Vegan version is black beans and wild rice. Then this place would be perfect"}
{"text":"We found this place while walking around the planet Hollywood mall. You get a free margarita when you check in and it was actually really delicious. Food portions are large! We got the lobster enchilada, enchilada nachos, and chimichanga, and they were all delicious. I would come back to this place."}
{"text":"Probably the best nachos I have had on the strip. The service was amazing and there is a great selection of beer. The food came fast and looked great. The taste was remarkable! Kirsten was very attentive and made great recommendations for first timers."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, loved the staff, but the food was lacking.   We got there for Monday Night Football and grabbed a great seat by the bar. We immediately ordered the Mexican Corn and the Spicy Shrimp Nachos. The corn was okay. Definitely over cooked or had been cooked and sitting out a while. The nachos were horrid. For $17 you get maybe 4-5 medium shimp cut up into smaller pieces. The chips were SO greasy!!!! For $17 I was expecting more. The worst part is that I've been up since 3am with food poisoning from the under cooked shrimp. I should have known by looking at them.   The staff is the only reason I gave two stars. Attentive and genuine.  I so badly wished the food was better. I'll gladly go elsewhere, pay half that price and get 5 star nachos."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. Bar is first come first serve but there was only a 15 min wait. We decided to sit at the bar and the bartenders were very nice and helped us immediately after sitting down. Peach margarita was delicious!! Open face chicken tamale and chick tacos were fantastic. The food came out super fast as well. Definitely a great find! So glad we came!"}
{"text":"I came here on taco Tuesday and had the chicken tacos. Sat outside in a nice chill atmosphere. Our service from Mark was fantastic! I'd come come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  We took a chance while walking around on the strip for some good food.  Checked out the reviews and stopped by.  This was a terrific find.  Ordered the steak fajitas for two, and shared nachos..party of 4. We were taken care of by Ryan...she was awesome.  Very attentive.  We enjoyed ourselves so much that we went back the next day for lunch...asking for Ryan.  Highly recommend her and this place"}
{"text":"Location was a little tricky to find to but the food and service were excellent! We sat at the bar only because we were starving and didn't want to wait 20 minuets for a table. Scarlett(?) I believe was her name was awesome, super attentive and personable. We got margaritas, filet nachos, Mexican corn, and chicken quesadillas. The nachos were out of this world. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food! Felt fully satisfied. Would definitely come again. Staff were super friendly, always smiling and service was incredibly quick, even for a Friday night. Very happy to have ended my night here."}
{"text":"Awesome place for some quality Mexican food! We split the vegan nachos and they were fantastic! Our waitress was great and very attentive. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Always pass by this place so my wife and I decided to try it out. They sat us right away which was nice. But then we waited 15 minutes and left... no one came up to greet us or ask for drinks or anything !. The sad thing is the place wasnt even busy . Sorry but if you cant say anything withing 15 minutes of me seating at a table that means you offer bad service.  I will never give them another chance . Good luck with staying open."}
{"text":"Best nachos I have ever had. Ordered the fiesta chicken nachos subs Redford beans for black beans and added fresh jalapeños. Perfect! The chicken was nicely seasoned and so moist. Highly recommend this place. However, not a big fan of their margarita."}
{"text":"Not a great experience. Nachos were VERY soggy by the time we finally got them (not normal soggy chips at the bottom). My friend's fork was dirty and still had food on. Asked for a new one and still didn't have one by the end of the meal. Drinks weren't refilled until meal was 3/4 of the way over. Food: mediocre. Service: awful."}
{"text":"I've never had nachos that weren't soggy until I got to Nacho Daddy. Best hangover cure ever."}
{"text":"The Enchilada Nachos were Absolutely Amazing!!! Best nachos I've ever had ! I got it with the green sauce and it tasted exactly like Enchiladas. It was also a perfect amount for two people"}
{"text":"Wait 20 minutes for terrible service and overpay for mediocre food. Been here several times. It doesn't get better. We aren't coming back anymore. Better food and service and prices basically everywhere. Don't go here."}
{"text":"They gave me a free margarita, they are pretty alright. Priced less than most restaurants on the strip."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the Love Bites 2018 Yelp! event they catered for Valentine's Day, as I've never been to any Nacho Daddy as of yet. They had the Cinnamon Margarita, Daddy Margarita, and a Scorpion shot which they're known for. My favorite was their Daddy margarita but the Scorpion shot is a must try! I definitely felt like a \"weasel\" (Encino Man reference) lol! I actually swallowed the first one, but the second one refused to go down then  lodged in my throat and I coughed that baby up lol. It's definitely something all tequila drinkers must try at least once. The best part about the booth were the ladies behind it serving up these concoctions, especially Rebecka (awesome personality and great attitude) to whom I'll be paying a visit to soon at the Miracle Mike Shoppes during happy hour Monday's from 3-6 PM. See ya all soon!"}
{"text":"We came here to have a nice dinner and I was pretty dissapointed with my experience. The service was horrible. We had to ask multiple times for certain things because he forgot. My boyfriend ordered a beer special they had and they were out of it. But instead of telling him they were out of it, he just brought him a different random beer that he didn't even really like. A lot of other beers that our friends and family asked for, they were also out of. He brought them bottles of beer and didn't even bring chilled glasses. We didn't receive our chops and salsa until they brought out our actual dinner plates, after having to ask for them a couple of times. I got the Thai Chicken Nachos and I was really unhappy. I've gotten them before and loved them, but when I came here, they were bad. I had almost no cheese or sauce on them. Half of my plate was just chips with nothing on them because there wasn't enough cheese or sauce to cover them. There was very little chicken too. Definitely not worth the $15 to eat half a plate of just chips. Nachos should have a lot more cheese on them. Everybody else at the table said their food was ok. Nobody was very impressed and a few had to ask for stuff over and over because it didn't cone out with their meal."}
{"text":"With a friend's recommendation my wife and I went to Nacho Daddy when visiting Las Vegas.  With a check in I had their basic margarita, which was actually quite good even at 9 am.    We ordered the grilled Mexican corn, enchiladas, and the fiesta nachos.  The corn was tasty and can tell it was fresh because it was sweet and a bite to them.  The enchiladas were okay, not stellar.  Not a fan of neither red or green sauce, so can suggest one over the other.    Fiesta nachos were really good and what they say is true that not one chip was dry.  Also quantity was great and plentiful.   Service was also great.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  Also the scorpion tank as you enter the restaurant was pretty cool to look at."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Cassandra was very helpful. They have a huge tequila selection and bottomless chips- yum!! Ambience was chill for a mid-day. A great place to relax in the afternoon between pool parties."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexicorn Corn and Margaritas! Anthony was great! My second time here and I'll definitely keep coming back!!"}
{"text":"Let me first say that the service provided by our server Job was excellent. This review is solely based on the food and drinks we had. The margaritas were nothing to write home about. Margaritas are my thing and theirs just didn't cut it. The Thai Bowl was ok. I needed to ask for more sweet chili sauce to get more flavor. Hubby got the smothered burrito, which he enjoyed."}
{"text":"I gave this establishment two stars only because I sat at the bar and one of the bartenders was good. I ordered a michelada it was made with tomato juice not Clamato. I was at the bar and saw multiple customers come in but there wasn't a hostess. So they left. After I drank my \"attempt at a michelada\" I was never asked if I wanted another drink. I ordered Buffalo chicken nachos, what I got was some nasty pile of stale tortilla child with sour cream and Buffalo chicken sauce that took 30 minutes to prepare. I do not recommend this place to anyone, and I'm not picky at all."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with some friends from outta town, our server was M.J. She was fantastic, very knowledgeable and offered suggestions which was super helpful since over half of us had special dietary needs/restrictions.  We got scorpion shots, tasty margaritas and happy hour beers. The Vegan chicken was just like actual chicken, amazing! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Hubby ordered steak fajitas and I ordered American tacos.  The door was really good and plenty of it.  The fajita plate was hot the whole time while eating.  We went late on a Thursday night (9ish?), so they were busy cleaning up.  The waitress (Hazelanne) was good, but we did have to wait for her to come around so we could get side items. I would definitely go back again! Endless chips and dip was awesome! Someone had put a great tip on here...it may be part of the Planet Hollywood Casino, but you can't get to it from inside.  It's on the side street (Harmon)."}
{"text":"Nachos are amazing and free check in margarita fits my picky taste! Great prices and huge helping of nachos! Got the chicken Thai ones"}
{"text":"Came here super late for some quick grub and a drink, and let me tell you. Probably one of the best enchiladas and nachos I've ever had is from here! The margaritas were alright but other than that, super yummy food!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and the service was fast. Checked in and got a free margarita. Was seated right away."}
{"text":"Omg seriously this place is absolutely amazing .. best food phenomenal service .. shout out to Aly & Dom .. you two girls made our day .. thank you for everything .. we will definitely be back & make sure to spread the word !!!Thanks Peter for letting me be your taster !!"}
{"text":"I ordered some nachos that the server recommended. The steak nachos. They were $20 and not very good. I've had better at crappy pubs. Server was very slow to and no one was there. Not the best experience."}
{"text":"Oh man do I love nachos. Out of all the choices in LV to dine, I still chose to eat here twice in 3 days. I had the BBQ pulled pork option the first time and it was nothing short of amazing. Fresh, hot and crisp, with cool sour cream and guacamole. Yum!!!! If you like tex-mex style food, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Mark was an amazing server. He deserves more than 5 stars.  Made the experience a great one for us as we enjoyed our lunch here.  Good food,  drinks,  and this guy... what more to make our stay in Vegas an awesome one.   Thank you Mark!"}
{"text":"The service was good. Stored our outside drinks for us. Nachos where great. Don't agree with a Mexican restaurant to charge for chips and salsa however. Margaritas tasty and got a to go cup. Servers were nice and gave us advice on what to check out as tourist"}
{"text":"Pretty good but not amazing. The nachos I got were nothing special. Lots of dry chips were left on my plate because the toppings werent layered. Nachos are nachos though and they are always delicious even with some dry chips. The free marg with check-in is super cool and the happy hour menu is great! Great place to check out if you're on the strip and want some good old nachos."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say affordable, good and great food!! The nachos were soooooo good, I went twice while in vegas"}
{"text":"Tried this place with my family for the first time last night because I received coupons in the mail from the service to the food very good will definitely come back your try everything else on the menu  (nacho supreme OMG and house Margarita)"}
{"text":"Below average Mexican food. Very expensive drinks.  I'm not sure why it gets such good reviews on here people must not have ever at good Mexican. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Are here three times while in Vegas very good, Jovanny was a amazing server! Get the chimichanga and check in for free drink!"}
{"text":"Luz is the best! Her attention to detail is unbelievable. Luz's fun and pleasant demeanor will bring our group back in every time we visit LV. Thanks so much for a great dining experience, Luz!"}
{"text":"Grand Opening...  Huge Failure!!  What a disappointment!  I was told how great this place was per their other locations.  Not only was it not great, it, in all ways, redefined mediocre.  The food portions were smaller than should be, toppings scarce and waitress not well informed or may have been stoned.  Either way, I was totally underwhelmed.    If I am opening a new location I make sure the nachos are loaded with cheese and toppings.  Not the case.  This is nachos, not beef wellington.  Should not have been that hard.  Maybe they need to send their staff to the other locations to see what it SHOULD be.  If they can't afford food costs which have to be maybe 10%, don't bother.  And neither should you."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for the Knights game. We had a little mishap but our server, Christina and the manager were delightful in making everything right. Will return again for good food,, great service and cheer our Knights onto victory"}
{"text":"It was our first time in Vegas! Decided to stop by Nacho Daddy and had a really good experience, food is amazing, and don't let the name fool you they sell a lot more than nachos (the BBQ chicken nachos were amazing). Our waitress Sofia was very helpful and she's another reason we will be back to nacho daddy!"}
{"text":"Excellent place. Great service. Nice getaway from the strip. Prices on food & drink are excellent compared to other places in or near the strip. The Thai chicken nachos were awesome!! Definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"So, so good. Conveniently located next to PH and their shops, though it took a second to find (right next door to BWW). Pretty busy, but it was a Friday night.  We were seated relatively quickly and drink orders taken right away.  Nice selection of tequila and beers. Food was awesome. The filet mignon nachos were great, though I'd probably try something else the next time. Those chicken wings though... Would come back just for them! Service was friendly as well."}
{"text":"Wow! 2 of us visited Nacho Daddy on a Thurs pm, dinner time. We had a 15 minute wait to be seated, and the server greeted us within 2 minutes. We had Dean as a server, and he was kind, \"with-it\" and a great server. Our meal...house margarita (comp'ed with Yelp check-in), vegan queso app, giant side of pico de gallo (yum), and smothered pork burrito. Meal was monstrous and delicious. Service time was great for a crowded dinner time. (Make a reservation, it's a pretty tiny spot.) The bar had lots of tv screenage for sports with one screen on the restaurant side.  I'll note I liked the way staff worked together well, maximizing service efficiency. Too often anymore, servers minimize service for the section they work in, and ignore the guests next to their section because there is no tip in store. Not the case at Nacho Daddy. Kudos to the mgr and service team! If I lived in Vegas, I'd eat here, often. Our experience was great!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Vegas with my mom and sister, walking the strip and stopped here because mom wanted Nachos. Apparently we hit the jackpot (no pun intended ).  We ordered the supreme tostada nachos. Thank goodness we decided to share. Big ol' plate of nachos.  The restaurant isn't anything special, your typical sports bar. Nachos were really good, could've used more guacamole....but seriously what doesn't?  The service was meh...not very busy and service was still super slow."}
{"text":"OMG! Words cannot express how amazing this place is. Party of 6 and they sat us in a timely manner, quickly took our drink and food orders. To our surprise, food was delivered within 8-10 minutes. Every order was delicious! Drinks were amazing! Service... attentive, professional, and friendly. Take time to stop by and enjoy some great Mexican food in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour and it was bomb! We got the bbq mini nachos and Mexican corn and the margaritas. It was delicious!!! And a good deal!"}
{"text":"Was bad food. We waited 40 mins for a take-our order and then it was REALLY dry and bland. Overpriced, too! I expected more. I got a fajita bowl and could have made it better myself."}
{"text":"Great place . The chicken fajitas are delicious . And have a fab presentation . Splurge on the fried ice cream ."}
{"text":"Our server tonight was Zach he was very nice and informative. It's rare to get good service these days and he showed us a great time. The food was delishes and the atmosphere was delightful. Would definitely recommend this spot  and will surely be back. Overall a 10/10! The prices are reasonable. The drinks are strong. And the service is exceptional!"}
{"text":"I love that I can go to a restaurant with friends and family and have a vegan menu for myself! The Skinny Dip vegan queso is awesome! Love their vegan loaded nachos!!! Sara was amazing and everyone was very friendly! My hubby had the new vegan avocado street tacos and they are AMAZING!!! Oh yeah and I almost forgot the margaritas MMMMMMMmmmmmm....."}
{"text":"Jovany is the man! He took great care of our astronomically sized group of pseudo-adults.   Margaritas are free with a check-in! Great fun with great company. Believe it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I found this place months ago and we where very excited to come back and watch football games when the season started up again .. We call at 10 am and ask if a certain game will be playing they say yes .. We show up we ask are u going to show a certain game they say yes .. Until we sat down at the bar , young guy in charge of changing Channels was very rude to my wife and we kept on getting the run around .. Very bad first impression we will not be returning very bad for this place because we always bring a big crowd .. So we went down the street to pkway tavern and got excellent service ..  Not sure yet if that was a positive thing at The end lol .. GO BOLTS"}
{"text":"Good spot to munch and have drinks with just about anyone. My kids loved the food and the adults liked the drinks and vibe. We were well taken care of by Jovany."}
{"text":"Easy to get too off of the main South Las Vegas BLVD. Prompt service and excellent food choices. Ordered breakfast, chillaqilles, chicken kale breakfast and a hearty breakfast burrito. Resounding thumbs up - and yes they have take out"}
{"text":"Been a regular there and have the vegan nachos which are always a favorite. Not any more! They left the price the same and removed the veggie patty. Really unhappy about this. Looks like Nacho Daddy is going el cheapo."}
{"text":"Great! Food was good and drinks were awesome. Good ambiance and friendly staff. I ate the filet mignon nachos and chicken burrito."}
{"text":"Overall good but not amazing. The bbq nachos were so smothered in bbq sauce that it was all I could taste and took away from the dish. The sloppy joe nachos were good. I'd try it again and maybe order something different."}
{"text":"Was in Las Vegas for the night had to try it out . It was 1 am an nachos where amazing . Bartender was nice and friendly will  be coming back for their scorpion shot"}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner because of the yelp check in (free house margarita with entree) and the close location to our hotel (Signature at MGM). We ended up coming here 3 times during our trip! They have happy hour on Monday-Friday 3-6, $5 margaritas and specials on other drinks/food  1. The frozen house margarita is awesome! Some previous reviews say it's not strong, but it was plenty strong for us, 28 & 30! ;p And not too sweet also.   2. My husband's favorite was the chicken enchilada nachos with both red & green sauce. I got the kale salad with shredded chicken 2 times! It was full of big pieces of veggies, a big salad, and the shredded chicken was great. For $10.50! We don't get great salads for that price in OKC.   3. For happy hour we got the mini BBQ chicken nachos & mini nacho average burger nachos. My husband really liked the nacho average burger nachos, meat seasoned well and lots of lettuce/tomatoes. The BBQ chicken had too much BBQ sauce for our taste. The toppings were good, just overpowered by the BBQ sauce.  Like I said, we made 3 stops here and I also bought a tank top with the silly nacho daddy on it. We will definitely return next time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Spicy vegan burrito and vegan nachos are really really good if your vegan. Great service and very friendly. Highlet recommend. AJ is very nice and has great information about Vegas and other Vegan restaurants. Thank you"}
{"text":"It wasn't a bad place..the atmosphere was as cool and our bartender was cool. I wasn't impressed with margaritas though. We had the blood orange, white peach, and pineapple mint. They all tasted exactly the same... like the sweet and sour mix. And for the price I would rather have gone to a casino. The chips and salsa were decent, the best thing we had was the avocado tacos. I would go back for that...and that only."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was sub par.  We had to ask for sides a few times that we ordered, the server failed to mention extra charges for certain requested items, which is crucial. Then she forgot to give me all my change. So overall, the experience was okay but the service could be better."}
{"text":"AMAZING food and AMAZING service! Serrena was our server and she was very attentive and very helpful in decision making. It's pretty pricey but what do you expect being a restaurant right on the strip? The amount of food was worth the price to me! Satisfying pork tacos and the enchilada was delicious! We also had the deep fried ice cream and we demolished it! I would definitely come back here if I'm in town and craving Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"The food is tasty! Try the Lobster tacos, you will not be disappointed! Chicken enchilada is good as well."}
{"text":"Yummy nachos,margs and fajitas!!! Yummmmmm! I had the best server there, Richard!! I recommend this Nacho Daddy restaurant!"}
{"text":"The free margarita check in offer drew us here, as well as the pics of good looking nachos. We were freaked out by the photos of the scorpion shots (not our kind of deal), but actually the tank with a few scorpions in it at the front was pretty cool. I hope they keep those ones alive.  For our late night dinner/snack, we shared the Thai chicken nachos, which are interestingly made with spinach chips. Portions were sizeable and the chicken was well flavored. The veggies turned out to be bean sprouts and bell peppers. Overall happy with the food, it was a nice light dish without being too heavy.  Gabby was our server, and she was awesome! She got us both margaritas, including one strawberry margarita. Yum!"}
{"text":"It was our first visit and everything was great. Aly was our server and she was great. Good personality, made helpful recommendations, and was very efficient. She even helped us check in for our free margarita.  I has the Thai Chicken Nachos and they were great. Everyone else in our party loved their food as well. We're going back again today for breakfast."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection of menu items and great friendly service!  Hard to find because the entrance is on the street and not inside of the Miracle Mile mall.  Now that I've found it, I'll be back.  Went to watch the NBA final game and TVs everywhere.  Tried the fajitas and was pleasantly surprised at the flaming table presentation.  So good and tasty!  Triple dip chip with melted queso cheese was something I've never had anywhere and it was great.  Went to Vegas for my wife's birthday so I asked if there was anything my birthday girl could have.  We chose a free churrro sundae and our server Taylor B treated us great!   Other servers were also very friendly and helped when we needed to cancel a menu item because their generous portions led us to know we couldn't eat everything we initially ordered.  Great food, service, and atmosphere. What else can you want for great food in Vegas without having so spend a ton of money!"}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy's menu is packed with flavor, no matter which location you select, but the service at this location was poor, almost non-existent. Mom and I went during a quiet period, which might explain why our hostess was bored, but we aren't accustomed to the staple of mediocre service in Las Vegas.  Our food was served, thank goodness, and was delicious, but the service will never have us returning to this location."}
{"text":"Ok let me start off by saying this place is fantastic I went on my birthday and got the chimichanga it was so good. They give you a lot of food and it's also made with love everything in Vegas is good all the food that I've tasted was really good and Im from Dallas Texas and shout-out to the waitress who hook me up with a shot for my birthday thinking it was Sierra not sure cuz it was my birthday but man great music it was it was really fun."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy was delicious! We called ahead for a Friday night and they had a pretty reasonable wait time. The group met there and put our names in their reservation texting system (which I always appreciate). We were notified via text that our table was almost ready and seated promptly after our arrival. We ordered the queso which was good but I don't think the tea light candle does much to keep it warm. I got the cali burrito which was AMAZING! I've eaten many burritos in my life and this was definitely one of the tastiest. My husband got the fish taco and enchilada which were also good. Portions were huge! Waiter was nice but he didn't fill out waters which wasn't great. We were way too full for dessert."}
{"text":"2pm Sat afternoon, running errands stop for lunch. Restaurant is half full. Tell hostess I want to sit in the bar to watch the football game and  \"Have lunch\", one empty high top. Sit myself. After 5 minutes I go back to the hostess to ask her for a menu. She never bothered to bring me the menu. After 20-25 minutes with 4 different servers walking by, quickly making eye contact but not so much as offering a greeting, much less ask me if I'd like to order anything...I left. Yes the menu was in my hand the entire time, at a table by myself, in a half empty restaurant.   On the way out told the hostess nobody bothered to wait on me, I'll go elsewhere. If you don't know the basics of the service business don't try to run restaurants. #fail"}
{"text":"Not good. Nachos were ok. Went back for tacos and was very disappointed. Hard shell served laying on the rice, so a total greasy mess. Chips and salsa were not very good, primarily because of the salsa."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service  Our table ordered the Fiesta nachos as an appetizer and they were great. I ordered the Cheesy Enchiladas, and the other two in my party ordered the Chicken Quesadillas and Chicken Enchiladas. The food tasted great.  Our server was Alex and he was hands down one of the best and friendliest servers we've had anywhere. He was very nice and worked quickly and made sure everything was okay at our table and you could tell he was sincere and actually cared about the response.  One of the best experiences at this location, and a big chunk of it was because of Alex and his great service. Will for sure come back"}
{"text":"Shrimp ceviche is pretty good, nacho entrees are huge. Burritos are ok, nothing spectacular stick to ordering any nacho platter."}
{"text":"Nice place for a quick bite. I wasn't expecting the amount of onions that came out on my taco but it was still delicious. Beans and rice were ok, the Margarita was amazing! Service was great: friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Nacho daddy is a local winner! Tried the enchilada nachos on my servers recommendation, very tasty. My only mistake was coming in alone. I don't eat much & these nachos are huge, definitely coming back to share with friends. Also had the margarita. I have to say it was one of the tastiest I've ever had & I can see why it's a local winner. The manager Sarah was wonderful as was my whole experience."}
{"text":"Great start with getting a free margarita by checking in. Ordered the queso and cheese enchiladas and both were fantastic. Super great food if you are in downtown Las Vegas. Excellent service as well! Would come again"}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back. I absolutely loved the vegan nachos yumm. The vegan fajita were so realistic tasting that I had to ask my husband over and over if he was sure he ordered the right thing, because I thought I was eating real chicken, Fortunately it wasn't :)"}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy is awesome! They serve up some pretty good food and have lots of fun nacho dishes. I love that they have a whole page dedicated to vegan dishes. Their vegan nachos were so delicious!"}
{"text":"Patio action in February is always A-OK in my book. The 75 degree temperature this past week was the catalyst for my recent visit. I needed a drink on a patio and Nacho Daddy has Union Jack on tap and/or a free house Margarita with a Yelp check-in. I skipped on the margarita (saved the offer for later though) and opted to share a pitcher of beer with my party. Union Jack pints were $7 and pitchers were $25.   It was mostly about the atmosphere and alcohol so the only food I tried was the order of spicy shrimp nachos. It was good for what it was, bar food to soak up some of the alcohol. The service was great, our drinks were never empty. Not awesome but good enough to sit and sip on the patio. The beer selection does take it up a notch if you want something other than the usual tecate or modelo offered at most Mexican spots in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great portions; good food! Loved the free Marg with the check-in! I recommend being adventurous and trying the special ones. Loved the pulled pork Nachos"}
{"text":"VEGAN WIN!!! My fav spot in Vegas, hands down. I usually UberEats or Postmates bc it's well-priced and comes to you anywhere on the strip super fast... to your hotel, the pool. Anywhere. I get the chick'n fajitas or loaded nachos, but the shrimp nachos and burritos are amazing too for meat eaters. It's also a cool vibe and great spot for drinks in-person.  Cassandra is the best bartender.... super nice and solid drinks.  Pineapple Mint margarita is BOMB. Vegan and meat options for everyone in your group. Eat here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I like this place. Looks like part of a local chain but the service was still friendly and the waitress was nice. The restaurant is about a block from the strip, and is definitely walkable from the strip.  I ordered lobster and crab soft tacos (the priciest soft tacos they had on the menu...prolly coz of the seafood) and loved that the food wasn't heavy. The tacos tasted fresh and light...and unlike many other mexican places I went to where you felt sluggish, bloated and sleepy afterwards...I felt energized after eating those tacos for sure.  Prices were reasonable, especially given the fact that they are in close vicinity from the strip. The waitress was also attentive, too. She was friendly and worked to refill our sodas promptly and took care of bringing the bill at the right timing as well."}
{"text":"We were in a time crunch for dinner and our waitress did a great job getting our food and our check out on time. Most of us had the soft taco with chicken and it was pretty awesome. The tortilla that it was wrapped in was the best. :) I would highly recommend it for a place to quickly eat and drink before hitting the strip."}
{"text":"Amazing service! MJ I commend you girl, you work your butt off!!! you kept a smile on your face and made sure we were taken care of!!! I only want to see you everytime I come back, because of you I will be back!!! thank you so much for making our trip memorable! hands down you are the ONLY one I seen work the whole restaurant!!! I can not express my gratitude to you!!! thank you so much!!!"}
{"text":"Great food here! Huge menu and their nachos are great! We are vegan and this place had the best vegan menu on the Strip. Would highly recommend if you are after some good Mexican food. Huge televisions to watch sport, and it seemed like a fun place to grab a few drinks before heading out on the Strip!"}
{"text":"So, the food is good. We got some tacos and burritos to take out to handle our late night needs. There are plenty of reviews that talk about the food,but I really wanted to give a shout out to the hostess Sarah (with the tattoos) she is the Energizer Bunny of hostesses. While we waited we watched as she greeted guests, took orders, checked out guests, cleaned, took out the trash, collected and stacked menus and even had to dance along a little to 'Thriller.' Never standing still always working on doing something."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and we got two plates of nachos the chimichanga and breakfast burrito... I have spent most of the next 24 hours in the bathroom while my friends had stomach troubles as well.... make sure you have a lead stomach"}
{"text":"The nachos here really are all that! Flew into Vegas Saturday morning and met up with my sister and brother-in-law. We got checked into our hotels and decided to head out for some gambling and food. Nacho Daddy's excellent Yelp reviews did not steer us wrong!  The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is that the front desk really needed to get their act together. No one was at the hostess stand and things were clearly very disorganized. That being said, once we finally got seated our waitress was great.   The three of us split two nachos, the spicy shrimp and the steak nachos. Both were great, lots of flavor and plenty of food for sure! We added guacamole to the shrimp, but it came later, and honestly for the extra $2 it wasn't really worth it.  Free margarita with the Yelp check in, so that was nice! Apparently you can upgrade to a higher quality margarita and then just pay the difference, but I'm not picky and the house margarita was just fine, especially at the price :-).  So many great places to eat in Vegas, but if you're craving nachos at a reasonable price, this place should definitely make your list!"}
{"text":"I would have to say, if you love Nacho then this is the place to be! We order the Thai Nacho, considering the fact I'm half Thai and never would even thought of anyone coming up with this dish was pretty amazing! Along with corn on the cob, and ceviche and some beers and don't forget too TRY the scorpion shot it's a must! Desiree our server extremely persistence, down too earth, and made us feel like home! By far the whole experiment was awesome, good energy and most important good vibes"}
{"text":"How to find it: street level, around the corner from Planet Hollywood, just past Buffalo Wild Wings. We had the fiesta nachos and they did not disappoint. It's a mountain of nachos that's easily enough for two hungry (and slightly drunk) people. Our server, Ryan, was awesome. Check in on Yelp for a free margarita - pretty great considering the steep drink prices on the Strip."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast spot!  This Mexican restaurant is much more than just their great nachos!  Leave the strip and eat here!  French press coffee, excellent breakfast choices - everything tasted great.  And a fraction of the crazy strip breakfast prices!  We will definitely be back for breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks, snacks, and NACHOS.  Love the \"buenos nachos\" t-shirts!"}
{"text":"Spicy chicken wings: superb  Supreme nachos: great  Quesadilla: meh Service: There was service? ? What happened to our server today? We did not get much follow up after initial contact. We were the ones closest to the entrance by the server station. Family of three. Yep, that was us. At one point, our server was preoccupied with trying to create a cocktail for the table next to us, I guess. Before that, I have no idea why she didn't come by occasionally. After we finished our meal we waited for approx 15 min to just pay. I had to contact another server who was nice enough to cash us out.  Sorry for the review, but we had a bad experience today. I'm retired and very patient, but I do have a liking to a somewhat timely pace. Please look at your customers tables and be able to judge their needs."}
{"text":"I've been to Nacho Daddy numerous time and love their food. This was the first time I had Dolla Bill as a server and be made the experience so much better. He was hilarious and entertaining all while providing great service... I will be going back and requesting Dolla Bill!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here! However there are days when the person cooking doesnt really do so great. Today I was feeling so down and depressed. I took my son here to also cheer him up. Our server LAEKYN was superb in her service! I have to say she was so wonderful! Laekyn was cheerful and was on top of everything! I honestly have not had such spectacular service anywhere in a very long time! I left Nacho Daddy feeling much better! And it was all because of how great Laekyn was! You have to ask for her to be your server! She is extremely attentive and knows what you need before you even ask! I also want to give props to the cook and the person who made the strawberry lemonade! Everything was cooked and prepared for excellence! Best experience I have had in a very long time! Thank you to everyone that took part in our awesome experience! Props again to LAEKYN!!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place, great food, my server Vince was very excellent!!!! I will be coming back. Cali burrito n shrimp tacos were amazing thanks Vegas"}
{"text":"Don't do it!!! Terrible service we got there at 7:00pm I we got seated and at 8:45 finally got the food. We called at 4:30pm to ask them to hold a table and they said sure. We arrived and the tables was not ready. The waitress brought water to half the table only we waited 30 minutes for the extra water and not to mention the drinks we ordered cane 59 Minutes later. I could go on and on but Lord know I've wasted enough time tonight!! Terrible service don't waste your time."}
{"text":"This is a review for a quick dinner on a Vegas night.  My husband and I were looking for something delicious to eat and nachos always sound good.  Combine this with the fact that it was taco Tuesday, and off to Nacho Daddy we went.  It was a quick Lyft ride from the NYNY where we are staying.  I highly recommend taking grandma to Vegas with you to watch the kids at night!    We weren't really sure what to expect.  On a Tuesday night, Nacho Daddy was pretty mellow.  When we walked in, I noticed a huge terrarium just inside with giant scorpions as long as your middle finger.  Yikes!  Of course, my husband thought it was cool.  We decided to sit at the bar.  Our bartender was a cool kid who had been working there for a few months.  He was very helpful as we asked about the nachos and tacos.  We went with the carne asada nachos and three chicken tacos/three carnitas tacos for $5 each (taco Tuesday deal).  I can tell you that the nachos were legit, super delicious.  Tacos were very good as well.  Pork tacos were stuffed with carnitas.  Can't forget to mention the drinks - I had a margarita.  It was classic and came with the right amount of salt.  My husband is a daredevil and went with a tequila shot with a (dead) scorpion on it.  Why?  I don't know.  Apparently they buy these dead scorpions by the jar from Arizona and people actually eat them - as did my husband.  He also bought one for the bartender.  They are allowed to accept up to two shots per shift from customers, haha.  Definitely worth a stop!  Check out the giant scorpion and have some nachos."}
{"text":"I ordered the filet mignon nachos and they were fabulous. The chips were excellent and the margaritas all were so good. My wife loved her kale salad and my other friends got the vegan queso. The queso was excellent. The chips were a bit over salted but I just wiped it off. The salsa was also good. The server was very attentive and brought the food out fairly promptly considering how busy they were. It has a lot of TVs and is a good place to watch football, baseball, etc.  I'd definitely go back any time."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a -5 I would. I was excited to check this place out. I am here and I am excited to leave.  -Soggy grease tacos that fall apart when you pick them up.  -poor service...I was never asked for another beer ( I had one) -don't ask for a sports event that is not on a national tv channel, they don't have any sports packages.  -I had to ask for a fork -our table was dirty and the bartender threw my date a rag to clean the spilled food and liquid from the last party.   This place is a dump. They must write their own reviews as warned by Yelp...STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"We got the filet mignon nachos, beer and free yelp house margarita.  Nachos were very good, toppings on each heaping layer and the steak was very flavorful.  The margarita was good and strong.  The atmosphere was great and I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Service was very good. Great waitstaff.  The food was simple American style Mexican food. Portions were moderate and for the money, they should have been a more substantial portion. As for flavor, not much to report. Unless you love salt. Everything was very salty. Come for the atmosphere, not the food. And if you want to food to taste better, check into Yelp for a free margarita."}
{"text":"Rachel is he best!!! Thank you for making this day amazing and for being professional! Give her as raise!!!"}
{"text":"VEGETARIAN & VEGAN FRIENDLY!  Wanted to get out there first to help my fellow veglife folks.  Carnivore-friendly too.  We had a wonderful meal here.  Great hip and casual atmosphere.  I had the chik'n enchiladas which were super good. I got a free $8 margarita for checking in on Yelp yay!  The margarita was delicious. There was a small snafu with hubby's meal.  He can't consume any dairy which we were very clear about when ordering but his burger accidentally came with cheese.  Honest mistake -- happens all the time actually.  They immediately took it back and began preparing a new burger, and the chef came to our table a couple times to apologize which, while certainly not necessary, was very kind.   I promised to remember his name but darnit I've forgotten.  I know it had 5 letters and might be Javen or Romen or something -- sorry! We would have happily returned here during our trip if only our hotel had been closer.  I look forward to returning on a future trip and trying more of the vegan options.  ***Edit: Chef's name is Ruben. Thanks for the follow-up email, Manager Taylor!"}
{"text":"My grilled fish tacos tasted like they dumped a whole salt shaker on them, the mango Margarita was way to sweet. No reason to come back!"}
{"text":"The beer flight was tasty, however the nachos left a bit to be desired. I has the filet nachos and it was a bit flat in flavor for the steak."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened tonight but normally the husband and i come here for lunch but my friends and i came here and it was a disaster. First off never heard only coupon per table instead of per check.  Service was slow,  and kept getting our order wrong.  Took 30 min for me and my friend to get water. Then when we finally got our nachos they were very bland and it was 45 min later.. Don't recommend ordering the fillet mignon nachos, there were only 3 pieces of meat on the entire platter. Not worth the 18.50.  We were so disappointed that this was the first time for any of us not to tip. Sorry i know restaurant business is rough but the poor service and food just left us irritated on our night out."}
{"text":"Great setting... open air ...roll up door.  Enjoying the free drink and remarkable nachos!  Bartender Sierra spot on and extremely friendly.  Oh, did I mention the scorpions?  Wife defines as \"interesting place\".  Take the time to visit.  Sierra is worth it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had some nachos and a beer. The nachos were ok. The beer was ok. My bill was $25. The beer, a regular glass of the house hef, was $9. Huh? Very obvious overpricing. Whoever owns this place should fire whoever sets your prices. The place is basically empty during peak dinner hours and it's kind of obvious why. You're selling chips with a little meat for $15 and what is basically blue moon for $9 a beer."}
{"text":"This place is fun and the waitstaff is upbeat, friendly, attentive and fast. This is totally elevated fast food...with alcohol. It doesn't get better than that.  We started off with the Triple Dip and a couple of Tortilla Soups. The soup tasted a lot of Chili Colorado except with chicken. The right amount of heat and flavor.  Wife got the Chicken Tamale and I got the Filet Mignon Nachos...that's a lot of food. I can be a big eater but even I had to ask for a to-go box. 2nd day...just as good!  Aside from their high-quality food, my wife and I were truly delighted at what a  great waitstaff they have..attentive without being intrusive, but letting us know that they were there if we needed anything. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The trio chips and dip is amazing. We also ordered fajitas, the burger, and the fish tacos. All excellent.   Keysen was our server and was totally awesome and helpful at making decisions. He made us feel comfortable and gave personalized recommendations. Awesome server!"}
{"text":"It is a good place to grab a frozen or on the rocks Margarita. I also liked their tacos and nachos. I enjoyed happy hour from 3 pm to 6 pm I just wished they had a late night happy hour. Overall everything was swell."}
{"text":"So lets start by mentioning there was about 4 tables being used. So barely no one there. Been here before. Never really had a problem but this time we ordered 2 drinks, we sat at the bar top for about 6 min before we asked a server (who wasnt our server cuz she wasnt around) if we could get them. He got them to us. We ordered churro sundae and queso dip..that took literally 20 min to get. (we had to ask for them to see if our order will be out soon since we've been waiting awhile) finally got it. The sundae didnot have the raspberries or cherries as described in the menu) i got my queso dip it came with chips queso dip and salsa...when the bill came there were going to charge me 13.95 for my drink when the menu says 11.95. And $1.00 for salsa. I told them i didnt ordered salsa i only ordered the queso dip (unaware queso dip doesnt accompany salsa) so overall pretty upset with the service and waiting so long for our drinks and appetizers and very unhappy woth trying to over charge me."}
{"text":"I don't know why I was blindly judging Nacho Daddy, since the location opened on Eastern. Now that there is one in my hood- in the old Firefly location on Sahara- a friend, who's been a longtime fan, suggested we grab a bite there. I loved the ambiance... still very Firefly'y, which I always found sort of... sexy? The hosts & our waiter were very friendly. My friend knew a shocking amount of Nacho Daddy fun facts, which was kind of fun & made me feel more connected to it. We ordered the elote (corn), Vegan \"steak\" nachos then went carnivorous with 3 mix & match tacos to try (chicken breast, filet & fish). Everything was delicious! My friend even gobbled down the whole filet taco... without saving me a bite... it was that yummy. The huge plate of vegan nachos were totally not weird. The \"steak\" had steak flavor & tender texture... we scarfed the whole plate but, because it was vegan, we didn't feel weighed down. Our favorite, though, was the fish taco... with a creamy dallop of cole slaw & mango salsa... it will likely be my summer go-to. I've already dined there a 2nd time, but at the Eastern location... I prefer the Sahara ambiance & staff more but the food was just as good. There was an awful man flipping out on our waitress & then to another staff member & I thought they handled it like champs. Certainly better than I was about to!"}
{"text":"This is the type of food I want when I'm in Vegas.  I always try to make an effort to come to Nacho Daddy when I'm in Vegas because it's a great restaurant with good service and yummy food for a reasonable price. It's a fun environment with constant music playing and a large dining space to accommodate larger parties. I've tried the fajitas here before and they're pretty good, somewhat sparing on the meat and heavy on the veggies.   This time, however, I decided to get the nachos. They're probably meant for sharing but I was able to kill it on my own because they were that good. The restaurant is conveniently located on Miracle Mile so if you pass by be sure to check it out. If not for the food at least do it for the Scorpion shot"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Took the kids here and they had a blast. Good service! Would recommend this place to others. Prices weren't too high either and food was amazing! Will be coming back."}
{"text":"We walked in and we're sat immediately.  Unfortunately we waited over 20 minutes with nobody coming to our table.  Then we were noticed by this server named AJ and he walked up was like have you guys not been helped yet? Then he said this isn't my section but I'm here now so I got this.  Super knowledgeable about the menu.  This kid saved our experience because the food was really so if the service would have remained poor we would have been upset.  AJ is the man.  Nacho daddy is now a must everytime!"}
{"text":"Fast food at expensive prices. Clumpy canned nacho sauce. Wings ok. Spicy tofu burrito SPICY, which is good. Server was very good. That's why it gets 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"Sports lovers... this is your place to be! Not the usual Vegas crazy place but pretty for sunday football!    If you are with a group totally order maybe 2 or 3 nacho's they are a good size to share with the group. The BBQ Nacho is a sweeter bbq but still pretty good. My favorite that we had were the enchiladas nachos Grade A!!!   I was a little nervous to try to scorpion drinks but it was pretty cool seeing the tank full of scorpions when you first walk in!  The fried ice cream was ok... the chips that come with it make it alot better but the fried ice cream taste like it was rolled in cereal rather than actually fried... there wasn't any crunch which was a little disappointing but overall not too bad. I would just order ice cream with the chips that come with it if i ever get it again. scoop the ice cream with the chips!"}
{"text":"I'm just going to say that this review might be a little biased because I was slightly drunk but the food was amazing the bartenders were super awesome and very fun ....mind you it was 1 o'clock in the morning!"}
{"text":"Fajitas were awesome.  Shrimp and steak fantastic. Pulled pork nachos were good but mostly pulled pork.   Our waitress and hostess were lovely.  Clean, quieter than most places.  Good drinks."}
{"text":"We had high hopes due to the reviews but were very disappointed. The fajitas we got were way too salty and the queso dip was not warm. After ordering a beer it didn't come out until we were already done eating. I would not go back. The portions were good and well presented but the taste and quality left much to be desired."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to grab a bite to eat before a show. And you get a free margarita if you check in through yelp! I ordered nachos (of course) and they did not disappoint. If you're in a hurry... grab a seat at the bar. Service is great and prices are quite reasonable compared to all the Vegas fancy spots. Great food for good prices."}
{"text":"Great place! Happy hour til 6pm and amazing nacho selection. Great location with drop off for Lyft. Kimberley is the best!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed from start to finish here. We came in pretty late so that may be part of the issue. But it's also Vegas so you'd think most places are able to accommodate at any hour. We came in around midnight and we waited for probably 30 minutes to get 4 to go meals. It was very busy so it was really disappointing. The menu is huge and I will commend them on having lots of vegetarian and vegan options to choose from. I got the vegan fajita bowl. It was not terrible but definitely not great. The meat replacement they add on top was very salty. I'm not sure if that was because of seasoning they used or if that particular brand of replacement meat is salty. The pico they added was alright but needed cilantro and lime for sure. The vegan sour cream was better than I assumed it would be. The guacamole was surprisingly good. Chunky and full of lime taste which was delicious. Another weird thing is the waitress came back to assume is out good was almost ready several times and told me twice \"they're just figuring out your vegan bowl\". I don't know what she meant by that but was kinda unsettling. Like I said it was terrible just won't be going back. If you're in a hurry definitely try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here a couple times. First time service was slow and 90s pop was playing on the tv. Why do i have to watch Xtina and BSB while eating??  I loved the guacamole. The bbq chicken nachos were pricy and tasty but a  sharable portion. The enchilada nachos were really really bland and soggy. Way too much cheese and they weren't even the right cheese. The Margarita was mediocre at best. Never saw the same server twice."}
{"text":"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEW:  On a Saturday evening, while everybody was dieting to get into that cute dress to see Hardwell, we were doing the complete opposite with the hopes that Hardwell thought we were still cute.   The vegan nachos was my favorite on the menu. The nachos were soy-based, which worked out for my nut-allergies, and I was told that the dish was also gluten free. I saw another server bring out an order of the same, and couldn't believe that the giant sized plate was the same our table had received. Apparently, I had scarfed down the entire thing, and still wanted more.  Our server Dezi was so nice. She made us feel welcomed and was quick to take care of our needs."}
{"text":"I love this place the meat quesadilla so good you have very well good customer service didn't take long to get my order up bartender was very polite also the price was fair"}
{"text":"Let me just say, I'm not one typically open to new places. I saw this place was super new and it had killer reviews and all these reviews are right. This was an awesome experience with my family and friends and we will Definitley be returning! Make sure to check in to get the free margarita it's pretty big! DJ our servers was legit. He danced to a Rich the Kid & Kendrick Lamar song while he brought our chips and salsa. Overall this place had zero flaws. 100% 10/10 recommend for everyone to stop by here while on the strip!"}
{"text":"I. LOVE. NACHO. DADDY.  Seriously, this place is awesome.  It has a great ambiance, great service, it's clean, has a fantastic and extensive menu, a free margarita with Yelp check in and entree purchase, and the food is delicious!  I could just stop right there.  But, really, you can get any kind of nachos you want and they are bomb; great flavor combinations, quality ingredients, and truly the worst part is trying to decide WHAT you are going to choose.  I've personally ordered the BBQ pork nachos which were OMG so GOOOOD and my own creation from their Gold something something, that was basically filet mignon and cheese.  Yeah.  SO GOOD.  The standard Mexican nachos got all the goodies on them and the buffalo chicken nachos are literally everything you think about when you order buffalo wings, BUT ON NACHOS!  I have a friend that ordered the ceviche and she says 'YUM', but I thought the portion was a little small.  For the amount and quality of food you get, the prices seem reasonable.  When in Vegas, you MUST GO HERE TO EAT.  If you don't, you will be sad.  In fact, I'm sad that that we didn't got a second time on our most recent trip.  But, thank goodness, we'll be back in a month.  CAN'T WAIT!"}
{"text":"We're visiting from Cincinnati and our hotel is right across the street. I have been dying to try this place since we got into town but just been so busy! Finally our last night here before our show Ka, we stopped by for some margaritas and nachos! Our server was super nice! We ordered the Grilled Mexican Corn on the Cobb, Daddy's Buffalo Wings, and the Golden Knights Nachos. The nachos comes with filet mignon but we switched it to chicken. The margaritas were awesome and strong! Our wings came out the Naked wings instead of the breaded and our server apologized- which was no big deal since we were planning to put in another order of wings! She was awesome for taking the Naked wings off of our tab since we didn't ordered it but honestly if that mistake didn't happened we would've never tried the Naked wings and we all agreed the Naked wings was so much better than the breaded! It was so flavorful! Everything was delicious! Loved the music as well! So sad we didn't try this sooner! We will definitely come back here next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and the food was amazing. Brian was a great server, will definitley be back here."}
{"text":"Best Nachos of my life.   I went to Vegas for a conference in August, herd about this place through my sorority sisters and it was great. I had a nice size of Nachos, with a strong but delicious blended margarita.  If I go back to Vegas, I'm coming back to Nacho Daddy for sure."}
{"text":"So GOOD! Everything we ordered was solid and what an amazing value. Especially for Vegas. I had the corn appetizer, filet mignon and Golden Knight nachos, and beer bettered fish tacos. Oh - and free margaritas with Yelp check-in! One of the least expensive meals during my time in Vegas and one of my favorite. YUM!!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good!  Definitely worth the walk to this place.  Kimberly is the best bartender in the world and hooked us up with margaritas that were delicious.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting this restaurant and Edward was such a pleasant and helpful server. He suggested I some of the restaurant favorites such as the buffalo chicken nacho which are delicious! Thank you Edward! I will be coming back on my next Vegas trip !"}
{"text":"Been to Downtown Nacho Daddy several times with rave reviews, we were on the Westside in Summerlin and decided to give this location a try.  Food was consistently good most likely because all recipes are made in their commissary kitchen.  We came during a late lunch so there was no one in the restaurant.  Food came out in minutes since we were the only ones in the dining area.   Our Nachos were delicious, the chicken tenders for the kids  did not look as fresh.  The chicken strips were an odd shape with a unique processed taste.    I will always be a fan of Nacho Daddy I think it is a great concept.  One of my favorite features about the Summerlin location is the self serve craft beer area.  You can purchase a gift type cardin $20 increments and draft your own glass of beer.  They have many great selections of local and regional brews available.  Insert you card and pull the lever and your credits will be deducted form your card.  WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT??!!! Great Idea give it a try.  I have seen a similar setup in wine dispensing before."}
{"text":"This place is overhyped. The food is good but a bit salty. You get a big portion so the price is fair. It just took a long time and it wasn't very busy."}
{"text":"Very cool look to it inside,  rustic industrial style.  Staff was friendly & comped our app because they forgot to bring it out until we were almost done eating, very nice of them,  we didn't expect it & just wanted to try the food! Food was good,  a little on the oily side if youre health conscious. Overall I'd recommend it for some tasty eats!"}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night around 9pm. The hostess was nice and pleasant. Our server Xavier stated he was busy and that another guy would take our orders. The other guy was great, but Xavier was a horrible server. Good food bad servers I had to wave him down to get the check."}
{"text":"Had the Flaming shrimp tacos and they were great.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is we got the trio dip and they bring such a small portion of chips so you have to get waiters attention for more chips.  Also, didn't feel like waiter stayed on top of drinks like I would expect."}
{"text":"Poor service and generic nachos. The place is overpriced and the servers just talk to each other."}
{"text":"This place is awesome to eat at food was lovely the service was fast an everyone was nice"}
{"text":"We ordered some nachos and a few other items. When our nachos arrived they had no cheese on them just chips and toppings of the particular style we ordered. Chris the manager apologized and really went put of his way to make things right. You can tell that this establishment has good food and I would recommend giving them a try. We will give them a try again and if the food and service is good change the rating to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Good food, better service! My boy DJ took care of our huge party like a champ. #wakandaforever"}
{"text":"Omg!! Chick'n tacos (vegan) are to die for!!! The caramelized chipotle onions are amazing on these tacos. The chicken looked so real I had to double check with the chef. Not to mention what great hospitality chef offered. He mention that he was the only GM vegan chef. The vegan loaded nachos were his idea. I tried those too and they were good but nothing compared to the tacos. Hands down the best vegan tacos I have ever had. Great job chef!! Btw if you are vegan they have a whole page dedicated to us vegans :)"}
{"text":"Do not order Thai tacos at a Mexican food place. The guacamole was good. Something was a bit spicy so I got a pina colada  and it wasn't even good. The service was great, I just ordered unwisely."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre nachos I thought, for the price.  I ordered from Uber eats, so maybe they are better in the restaurant than take out."}
{"text":"They just lost a good customer with a big family. I am a Vegan, & I go to this restaurant because they offer a Vegan menu, but not anymore! Tonight was the 3rd time they gave me REAL sour cream, when I always ask specifically for Vegan. This is unheard of! The service is horrible, but I tolerated it because of the Vegan menu, but I am done now! Never again!"}
{"text":"It is alright. It might be just I am not big fan of Nacho. Make sure you check-in and get your house margarita for free. There is parking structure near that you can park your car for free."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! Came back a 2nd time! Great service and great food!! Tried regular and vegan menu options between the 6 of us! We had Chase and Jacob--both were awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"disipointing, I guess its kinda what i should have expected from chain mexican on the strip but it had good review so I had higher expectations."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!! One entree of nachos was easily enough to feed two. Great place for groups as you can easily share your different selections. Service was great from the get go! Jovany took care of us from the moment we sat down to the seconds we walked out.   Location was great as well. Easy access from the Planet Hollywood miracle shops. Not too much foot traffic on the harmon side, so no worries about bumping into too many people turnt up. Haha.   Also want to mention that there are TVs every where! So if you wanna catch a game without all the Vegas intricacies, then this place is an easy option."}
{"text":"Was taken aback by the many choices for nachos. Ended up getting the Supreme Tostada Nachos, they did not disappoint! They also have a full vegan menu which is nice if you're looking for that. We ate at the bar and our bartender was extremely friendly and showed us the scorpions for the scorpion shot!"}
{"text":"Decent food at a decent price. The margaritas were pretty good too! The wait wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"Had steak fajitas and Margaritas, both were very good.Also enjoyed the patio and people watching. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing gluten free food! I highly recommend them. Try the chicken bowl and the fajitas!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for lunch or dinner. They have a fair amount of vegan options and their cocktails are amazing. The white peach margarita is my favorite.  Jovanny the manager was very friendly and made the lunch experience enjoyable.  Their downtown location is also great. Had a late (past midnight) dinner there after walking through Fremont Street. They have nice yelp deals (free house margarita with check in!)"}
{"text":"Awesome! Quick walk from the hotel, food was delicious and reasonably priced. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Ordered drinks at 10am.  I had the spicy cucumber margarita.  Husband had the Cadillac margarita. Service was fast, we sat at the bar. Last time we were here they took forever so we went with just drinks and no food."}
{"text":"Decent mexican food just off the Strip!  So happy this location opened and we ordered take out.  Other than forgetting to include one of the items we ordered (went back to pick it up) it was exactly what we wanted. Plus the name is great - it's fun to hear them answer the phone."}
{"text":"Delicious food to order late night. The nachos is more than enough for two people. Amazing!!! Would order again."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy was the best... Everything was good... went twice since being in Vegas... when we come back in Feb we will be back.. I ordered the crab and lobster street  tacos... Loved Loved them second time ordered the fajitas... The best!!! Love this place"}
{"text":"Omg!!! This place was the BEST!!! Me and the girls went for dinner it was so good they want to go for lunch tomorrow..."}
{"text":"Gotta go ahead and give this location five stars!! The food and the service were both awesome, our waitress was super friendly and attentive. Ordered the Vegan chicken nachos and the cucumber jalapeño margarita. We recently had a bad experience at a restaurant who was so called vegan and it turns out they truly weren't, which was disappointing. So sure enough, we were a little skeptical of trusting the food, but when our waitress told us the general manager is also vegan it put us at ease. Love that they had so many vegan options. Great experience."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed Nacho Daddy. Food is awesome and the portions are generous. Perfect place to go watch sports with their numerous TVs. Truly no bad seat in the house. Our server Morgan was absolutely marvelous and took care of our every need. Based purely on her service alone, we would come back. Food is definitely worth coming in for again as well. Highly recommend to anyone on the fence about trying it."}
{"text":"Good food, great veggies options! Roy and MJ = impeccable service. highly recommend.!"}
{"text":"Came here for a casual bite while watching football and our expectations were exceeded! We're from Texas but moved to NYC recently and really miss good Tex-Mex. The filet mignon nachos were outstanding and the cheese enchiladas were perfect. Lauren from Chicago was our server and she was so friendly and engaging!"}
{"text":"I have to say this place will always be remembered to me.  For all the wrong reasons.  The service started off horrible waiting at least 10 minutes to be greeted by our waitress.  Then when the waitress finally did come she never asked our drink order.  She was polite by asking if we needed more time with the menu.  But that's all. Then disappeared for another 5 minutes comes back and asked for our order.  I had to ask her if she was going to get us drinks and as if to be bothered she took our drink order.  By this time I knew the service was just going to get worse.  We have it the benefit of the doubt.  Just so happens the general manager walked by we voiced our concern and he was very quick to disregard the issue.  He was not listening to our concerns and basically said it was a simple oversight.  And it looks like we had drinks because we had water.  He was very unprofessional for being a general manager.  I don't recommend visiting this establishment ever.  The service was 100 times worse then a Applebee's visit.  So disappointed."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Monday evening and sat at the bar with 2 colleagues. Immediately greeted by Kimberly who gave us great service the whole time.   We shared the triple dip (great) and I had the filet mignon tacos which were excellent. Very tender steak, delicious salsa and perfectly crispy shell.   Awesome margs, overall great experience."}
{"text":"After waiting what turned out to be too long, I finally made it into Nacho Daddy and have been back several times since that first visit.  It was an explosion of deliciousness!  The food is awesome, and served in large portions.  I'd recommend starting with the Ceviche or Grilled Mexican Corn.  The Tortilla Soup is also delicious.  Their Signature Soft Tacos and the Fish Tacos were wonderful, and the Street Taco Combo is a favorite so far.  And finally, if you're in the mood for tamales, try the Mojo Pork Tamale.  Tasty!  I'm looking forward to exploring more of their menu in the future.  On my last visit for lunch I walked in and was struck by how \"normal\" the noise level was.  When this location was a different restaurant, it was always uncomfortably loud, but not now.  The noise level was very tolerable without dampening the fun (and almost exciting) vibe.  I've been back several times with just one or two other people, and also been there once with a large party.  TVs are all around on the walls and at the time were featuring one of the ESPN channels on several sets, and a very eclectic music video channel on the other.  Totally fun!  The staff always seems cheerful and eager to ensure everyone is happy--the waitstaff during every visit has always been fantastic.  With an ample parking lot around the building, there's plenty of convenient parking.  I definitely recommend Nacho Daddy for one of this evenings when you want to dine or have drinks in a place with tasty food and an upbeat atmosphere!  Get some!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Great food. The cali burrito has filet mignon and it was delicious. The meat was so tender and juicy. I definitely would come back the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best I've ever had!!  The spicy shrimp nacho is also my favorite.. dined at this restaurant twice at two different locations while on vacation lol"}
{"text":"My son & I went for lunch today and it was awesome!!  I don't know which was better, the food or the service... I ordered the Mexi Cobb Salad and it was soooo good!! My son ordered the big daddy burrito with filet and there wasn't a bite left on his plate.  Everyone was friendly but our server, Phil was phenomenal!  We went with a groupon. This was our first visit but most definitely not our last!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in since it was so close to our resort for a quick bite to eat. We were greeted promptly at the door and escorted to our seats. The restaurant has a very nice setup of being able to watch different types of sports throughout the place. It has one huge screen in the middle that has a really good picture.  I ordered the bbq chicken nachos . Keep in mind, you won't leave this place hungry. The chips were fresh and had a nice seasoning on them. The roasted corn, black beans, cilantro and of course the bbq chicken all worked very well together. The quest cheese is very good. It is one of the best that I have ever had. What makes this dish pop though is the bbq sauce. I've had a lot of bbq sauce from all over the world and this is right up there in the top five.  If you are visiting for the first time, stop in and be ready to eat hearty!"}
{"text":"Not that impressed with the service.  It took a while for our server to come over. Granted she did state she'd be right with us, it still took a while to get over to us and get us our water.  We were ready to order our drinks and meal by the time she did come over.  Food wasn't bad.  The nachos got soggy way faster than I expected but they were still good.  I got the bacon cheese burger nachos and water, as I wasn't drinking.  I wouldn't discredit them for this experience alone and would definitely give it another shot.  Despite the okay service the staff were mostly friendly."}
{"text":"The menu here had so many options, everyone is bound to find something they love. Our server Hazel was really great and friendly, and helped me customize some of the menu items. Things seemed really fresh, and the food came out pretty quickly!"}
{"text":"My family and I have a timeshare at the Hilton grand vacations. so we always stay at the elera. Nacho Daddy is right next door. My son loves the nachos and tacos here. i love the Surf and turf tacos. one is a huge deep friend lobster meat in a taco and the other prime rib in a taco the best of both worlds. with rice and beans,  and it's under $25 dollars.  I wish they had one out here in california. My son always ask if we can go to vegas for a day to get some Nacho daddy lol"}
{"text":"Just checked out this new restaurant and Jovany was our server and he was upbeat, friendly and super sexy covered in tattoos! Very professional and service was on point. Great place for girls and guys to hangout with great food and drinks and unbelievable service! Great job Jovany!"}
{"text":"I'm not a review person... but I could not resist! Best FRESH food you could eat and you have to go see Arieanna!! She was so helpful and honest! Her food and Margarita suggestions were off the chain!!! We will be back for more!!!!  GO TO NACHO DADDY!!"}
{"text":"The free margarita when you check in is so good! The nachos were amazing especially the ones with the queso on top! Mmmm definitely coming back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I have a bad experience before at a location downtown sadly this was no better   I hate to complain   But I always check in on yelp I guess it was a free margarita when you check in I sat my phone down I was in a convo with a friend the waitress walked up said free margarita I replied yes is that ok if I use this she picked up my phone and also wrote a tip saying \"Jessi rocks\" ITS NOT APPROPRIATE TO PICK UP MY PHONE AND WRITE THAT!!!! She said it looks good for the owners   We were suppose to have a big party it ended up just being three of us ....: she walked around with her son on her back giving him piggy back rides not sure how that is professional?????????? also sat down at our table a few times saying she was pregnant ???? I'm not sure how your waitress \"Jessi\" thinks this is appropriate   The only good point was our nachos were yummy   She left out table full of dishes???? She also came back and asked what my drink I'm not sure what was going on but this is my second bad review at a different location how horrible!!!  Oh and the bathrooms are DISGUSTING"}
{"text":"Update: Nacho Daddy reaches out to me and seems to be rectifying the situation. I haven't had a chance to go back yet, but they did take the time to listen to my concerns and invited me back. Hopefully this was a one time issue...   The Service was horrible. Went there on A Saturday about 5:45pm and the place was virtually dead. Less than a quarter of the tables were filled. When we checked in, we were told by the hostess that it was a 15min wait without any explanation as to why since there were plenty of tables open. We waited at least 15mins and kept looking over at the hostess station and she was busy wrapping silverware and chatting with 2 other workers. Needless to say we walked out and went somewhere else. It was a horrible experience for a first time guest...."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time yesterday while on vacation. I was drawn in due to their vegan menu.   I ordered the loaded vegan nachos. The reason I ordered this one over the Chik'n nachos was because of a review i had read on Yelp about the chick'n so I was naturally hesitant. Plus the chick'n nachos was around $1 more I believe.   Well they ended up bringing me the chick'n nachos instead of the one that I actually ordered. I was bummed but I didn't send it back because I didn't want to waste all of that food. It ended up being pretty good so I was satisfied at the end of the meal still.   Additionally, we got the triple dipper - I ate the guac and sauce while my boyfriend at the queso. We both agreed it was very good.  Our waitress (with mermaid hair color) was very attentive and kind to us while we sat at the bar as well.   I would definitely come back purely on the fact that they had a ton of vegan options! Kudos to Nacho Daddy for offering that!!"}
{"text":"Great tasting, fresh, reasonable and quick!  And vegan options - a whole page of them (see photo)   The churro pancake my guest had was huge and recommended.  I was happy with my spicy vegan burrito lots of flavour and kept me going for a while.  Open early for breakfast and had great coffee.  We were staying across the strip at the Aria and this was easy to access from there.  Good service too, we'd go back."}
{"text":"Cute place. The Vegan nachos are decent, I've honestly had better but they were pretty good. The Vegan Nacho Cheese Dip and Chips was also pretty good, I would have liked it to have been spicer. I would definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"Came here late on Thursday, not real busy, decor was rustic, staff was friendly.  She ordered a Margarita while we waited.  She had a smothered chicken burrito and I had the super nachos.  While the food was very good, and plentiful, we waited for what seemed like forever and her margarita never came.  Then the food showed up followed by her margarita.  About 10 seconds later our waitress appeared for the first time since ordering.  Though we watched her talking with other staff in the kitchen, she gave us some bull about being really busy and someone else must've forgotten about her margarita.  We told her it just came and the manager comped the margarita.  If it weren't for the food being very good this would not be a recommending review.  But the food was worth it and the comped margarita softened the blow.  The pricing was good as well, not expensive at all."}
{"text":"It's easy to dismiss nacho daddy as a tourist trap with their scorpion shots and nacho food theme. But beyond that is actually some pretty great food.  Feeling a bit frisky and you can try their awesome Thai nachos or lobster and crab nachos. Feeling healthy and you can get a salad. Gluten free and vegan options abound and are marked in the menu.  They even have a great breakfast, huevos rancheros were excellent.   Tequila selection was pretty good but the bartenders were clearly hired for other credentials than tequila knowledge, if you catch my drift.   All in all though my favorite cheap eats from my last Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Service was great. Music and decor were on point! We had cheese enchiladas and were not disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here since im not a local. My fiance and i love splurging on nachos on the weekend so Nacho Daddy's totally seemed up our alley. Gabbby & Jio hooked it up and made me feel totally at home! So glad we popped in...ill be back on my next vegas trip for sure."}
{"text":"Went for their amazing Vegan Chicken Nachos and not only received this delish meal but received the best service! Davor and Johnny were so outgoing and kind and made sure we had everything we needed.  The hostess and other server that were helping were also so sweet.  We received such great service that we had to comment on it and told Davor that we were very impressed and management is really making service with a great attitude, a priority!  Thank you for making our lunch such a great break in our day.  Good people, good vibes, excellent Vegan Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Nacho Daddy. It's a little pricey but it's a nice place to take family and friends that come in from out of town. They have a great tasting and real cool looking menu items and a lot of choices. It's a fun place you should check it out!"}
{"text":"Still waiting... called on Tuesday was told to call back when \"Pete \" was in. Dear Pete please give my money back and I will stop yelping. Thankx."}
{"text":"Go to the Nacho daddy downtown. This one is clearly suffering from \"franchising.\"  The staff were very friendly and attentive; however, the food quality was not on par with the old location. I have been going to downtown for years. It looks like a total hole in the wall but the food is a better experience. If you just want drinks this a a fine place and fun set up."}
{"text":"Awesome margaritas and the best bartender in Las Vegas, REBECKa!!  Had the best nachos!! Great farewell to Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I dined at Nacho Daddy; once as an omnivore and 2 months later as a vegan. Both times, I have found the food to be average and over priced. I was not a big fan of the nachos with real cheese, they tasted watery. And I don't care for Daiya Cheese on the vegan nachos.  I like the atmosphere and the fact that the restaurant offers a vegan options for fun family/friend gatherings. I don't hate the the food, but I don't love it either."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting this restaurant and I gotta say that I'm very pleased with the service and food! We went in and were immediately seated, we arrived there around 6:30PM. We were treated by our waiter, Shawn, who served our drinks quickly. My table and I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Nachos for an appetizer and they were amazing! The size was large and honestly I would have eaten it as an entree. We ordered our entrees and I got the camp fire burger (not exactly that name, but around those words) with a medium rare meat and garlic parmesan fries. The meat of the burger was so juicy and the buns were toasted to perfection. The fries were made to perfection, all of the fries were crispy and they didn't lose their crunch through the entire meal. But the fries were just a little too oily but still tastes amazing. Overall, I would say A++ for the food and service. Thanks to our waiter for the amazing suggestion and service.  The environment was nice. I liked that they had late 90s music playing in the background with the music video playing along. They also had sports games on tv like baseball, cross fit, and football. So A+ on the environment.   So I went here two days after (July 26) and the service here was bad. But I don't completely blame the waiters. There was probably 3 waiters serving the entire restaurant which made our food service slow. I do not know exactly how long we were waiting here for our food but it was probably 30-45 minutes. This place has its good and bad days. Let's hope that if you do go here, you get here on a good day."}
{"text":"Great place! Would recommend the golden knight nachos to anyone! Large portions.  Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was great! Hubby got the Thai nachos with the homemade spinach chips. We were a bit reluctant, not knowing what to expect, but they were delicious! The jalapeños were spicy, but that's expected.  I ordered the bbq nachos with pulled pork. They were very good too! They really piled on the meat, which is appreciated, and as they claim, no chip was dry!   Lastly, I ordered the spoke pie nachos with ice cream! The chips were warm and covered in cinnamon and sugar! Omg! If you are an apple pie lover, you have to try! I had never had anything like it!  Service was great, environment was great, I would definitely reccomend!"}
{"text":"While I am thrilled to have found a reasonably priced restaurant on The Strip, Nacho Daddy was only sub-par.  I had a smothered chicken burrito that was good but I felt like I could have gotten the same thing at Cafe Rio or something for about the same price.  They pride themselves on their house made chips which I found to be perfectly mediocre.  They were a little thin for my liking but good dipped in guac. It was pretty busy on Saturday night.  They told us it would be about 35 minutes for a table and that they could text me when our table was ready.  We walked over to the Miracle Mile shopping center next door and as soon as we walked in, they texted saying our table was ready.  It hadn't been more than 10 minutes.  I definitely prefer that a restaurant over-estimate than under but this was a little extreme.   Our waitress was very nice and training a new server who was also great. Overall, the atmosphere in this restaurant is like a Mexican-themed Buffalo Wild Wings which wasn't quite what we were looking for.  We still left full and happy."}
{"text":"Our waiter DJ was the bomb.com. The best nachos in town! Def recommend if you're ever in Vegas"}
{"text":"Fun spot, great food!! Bryce was fun and personable!! He makes a great margarita!! Check in and get a free house margarita. We split the filet mignon nachos and it was a perfect meal prior to a night out! Will definitely come back to try all the different nachos!!"}
{"text":"I love this place to the core!!! So good... the food and even the drinks are to die for and ultimately the customer service is fabulous!!! I can't wait to come back again just to eat the bbq chicken nachos and the margaritas are yum  yum yum"}
{"text":"Super good food and presented in such a fancy fashion. We started off with iced tea and a virgin pina colada, they both were quite tasty. We did the cheese dip with chips and salad and that was super yummy with the candle there to keep the cheese warm. Our server was super sweet and helpful but I forget her name - inside a lake outside a lake she kept saying to help us remember it was .. Enlake? Anyways she was super sweet and a great server. She kept my tea full and the food coming. We then did the enchilada combo and two orders of corn. I had a gift card so I was in for the tasting but my girlfriend could not get over the fact that 1 ear of corn was $6.50 when they are four for a dollar at the grocery store. We ate here last night and she's still talking about it today at lunch, wow she's in shock. I get it - corn is .25 at the store and $6.50 at Nacho Daddy LOL yeah sure they add cheese, salt, pepper, and mayo ...hmm does make you think. We ended the night with churro sundae's and OH YEAAA they were bomb. The little churro was warm and the ice cream was cold :) the whipped cream-a-plenty! We had a great meal thank you so much I will be back again oh and my friend wanted to tell you that you must lower the price on your corn, it's shockingly high :) ciao! Thank you :)"}
{"text":"Very cool place, great food with fun shareable options, cool music and great vibe. The staff was friendly and helpful. Someone in our party had a service dog with them and the staff was very accommodating. Our server Ryan was great and we loved the nachos!"}
{"text":"The spicy Shrimp and Lobster & crab nachos... OH EM GEE!! That's something everyone has to eat at least ONCE a month! Lol Servers are friendly! Atmosphere is pretty cool! Food is amazing!! Will definitely be coming back here to dine in and get some drinks!!"}
{"text":"I would give it one star, but the nachos were really good. Aside from that, me and my bf came in on a quiet night and there were only a few other people in the place. For some reason, it took us 20 minutes for someone to take our order. This blonde guy was scurrying around, but he wasn't doing much and he finally took our order and disappeared. We waited an hour before we got our food (which was really good), but even people who came in after us got served before us. It was disappointing because it was dead in there, but our server SUCKED!!! Then we paid cash, and he didn't bring the change and said \"you don't want the change right?\" Excuse me? Weirdest guy ever. And we bought the over-priced scorpion shot, and no one made it a huge, cool deal like they made it out to be. The weird server brought it out and walked away. Weird. Good food, but I wouldn't go back unless I was drunk and could stand the wait."}
{"text":"Stopped in last year for my birthday, the barmaid was very nice and gave me a free drink for my birthday! They make a kick ass huge marguirita!"}
{"text":"Brianna made the best margarita def need to visit her and she is sooooo nice and has a great convo!"}
{"text":"Had the filet nachos. They were amazing. First time here. I will be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"The supreme tostado nacho had really good flavor. The fiesta nachos were a little bland. Pretty decent sized portions of nachos!"}
{"text":"Just ate here while on vacation with my Gf.  Came during happy hour and took advantage of the free house margarita via Yelp check Inez  Best house margarita I've ever had.  Ordered a strawberry one after that and it was even better... best margarita I've ever had, sweet but not too sweet.   I got the filet Mignon nachos, pretty darn good.  We also got the triple dip, salsa, queso and Guac  All 3 were good.   The service was pretty good. We sat at the bar and often you feel a bit ignored at the bar of busy places but we got great service.  I highly recommend this place. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I weren't super hungry but wanted something in our tummy's so we tried the Nacho Supreme. They were very good nachos! Chips are cooked in house and we're super fresh, pico was fresh and tasty, and the meat was well spiced.  Over all great plate of nachos and the perfect amount to fill us up. I also had a mango margarita on the rocks that was good as well."}
{"text":"What a great vegan menu. It's so hard to find a place with good vegan food. Their nachos are delicious and the best in town. Their staff is friendly and attentive. Our waitress, Sarah was awesome! Plus they have a great margarita selection."}
{"text":"Just checked in and AJ is taking great care of us. The menu has a variety of items to choose from. So looking forward to my meal. I got the breakfast enchiladas and they were amazing. Great margaritas!!  Looking forward to coming back....real soon."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday gathering with 12 other people. Our server was Ryan and he was so great. I feel like big groups are often annoying for the people involved and particularly the server. He didn't seem bothered by us and was really friendly and positive the whole time.  We all loved our food! I love that they have a special vegan section on the menu. Those loaded nachos are fantastic!!! When you do the scorpion shot, it is really a small scorpion in the shot of tequila. But if you do the shot you get a shirt or shot glass to take home."}
{"text":"The Thai chicken nachos were delicious! I will come back and order it again. Chase provided great service. Very helpful. Thanks for the free margarita!"}
{"text":"Nacho daddy was a very good American Mexican restaurant to visit. The customer service was great. The house margarita with the \"Yelp visit\" was a great addition to the meal. The food was hot and tasty. The music in the venue reminded me of late 90s and the early 2000s so very nostalgic for me. The March madness basketball games were on tv. My server was very informative about the \"scorpion shot\" that the restaurant provides. I was very happy with the menu and will be sure to recommend to family and friends."}
{"text":"Fast and good service.  Staff is friendly and helpful. Nachos is delicious  Had the supreme tostadas nachos with a free Yelp check in drink."}
{"text":"Not bad... great food, very good service as well. The nachos can be shared and the all you can drink mimosas is a good deal as well."}
{"text":"I was really craving Mexican food while visiting Vegas, so I checked this place out for lunch. The servings were HUGE, and the staff was friendly. My only complaint is that they don't give complimentary chips and salsa like most Mexican restaurants do."}
{"text":"Great food quick service, followed through on free drinks and overall a good stop for late night food on the strip, will definitely stop by next time when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Bland.  Chips and salsa is okay. Having shrimp fajitas and they have no taste. Shrimp could not only be cooked more have some flavor. Onions and peppers are soggy and on top of this the rice has no taste and the beans taste like paste.   Well I tried worth the trip to the strip and El Segundo."}
{"text":"We stopped in at this newly opened restaurant pretty close to our hotel and had a great time. They have some unique menu items including spicy shrimp nachos, lobster nachos, etc. as well as some classic items such as regular nachos and tacos.  The waitstaff is friendly and eager to give you recommendations and advice on what to order. We went with the queso for an appetizer and their supreme nachos to share. Both were excellent. I had a house margarita, which was good but a little on the sweet side.  If you are feeling adventurous, they also offer a scorpion shot where you can shoot a baby scorpion in some tequila - or whatever liquor you choose. When in Vegas....you have to try something like this once...plus it makes a great photo opportunity. The scorpion will set you back about $9, on top of the shot - so not a cheap adventure, but how often do you have the opportunity to eat a scorpion?"}
{"text":"We came in at 9 pm with a large group of about 40 people. We had given them notice ao they knew we were coming. We ordered our drinks pretty quickly and then waited and waited.....waited. 20 minutes later, 2 of the 5 drinks were brought out. Then we waited and waited. An assistant manager came over and we told her that we hadn't received our drinks nor had we had our order taken. She said it's hard when a large group comes in close to closing. (We looked it up and found that they didn't close until 11 pm). We finally got food after almost 2 hours. The food was good, not great and not worth a 2 hour wait!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Arieanna is a fantastic friendly server and would get her to serve your table. Cheers to Vegas!"}
{"text":"What a great nacho place to chill and grab a bite! Love the name and theme of this restaurant, you walk into a spacious place with nice ambiance. Their nachos are very unique, and decently priced. And of course, they have their famous scorpion shot with an actual scorpion inside your alcohol.  I ended up getting the Buffalo Chicken Nachos. There was a generous portion and the chicken was great! The Daddy Margarita was also very flavorful.   All in all, it was a great experience and definitely would come back! Maybe next time I'll grow a pair and actually try the scorpion shot haha"}
{"text":"This is my favorite stop every time I'm in Vegas.  Fillet Mignon Nachos...  3 words that will change your life and definition of \"Amazing Nachos!\"  This most recent visit deserves a review due to the fact I had the most amazing bartender Sandra!   Sandra is simply the Best-is-tists ever! Super friendly and fun to talk to on a chill Tuesday afternoon.    I come back for the amazing nachos... i stay for the amazing staff who I love chating with while enjoying a cold Pacifico that they wisely have on draft!"}
{"text":"The nachos were good. But the unusually loud music and videos playing on all of the walls took away any chance of talking during our meal. Not a fan. The food was fine but the rest you can keep."}
{"text":"Jovany was an amazing waiter. He treated us with care and amazing service.  It was nice to be treated so friendly in such a big town. Food and margaritas were top notch!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food.  Great atmosphere. Been to all 3 locations and the downtown location is my favorite."}
{"text":"BEST OFF THE STRIP SPOT! Menu has quite the selection and the food was fantastic. Service is top notch!   Arienna was our server and she took great care of us, attentive, polite and SO FRIENDLY!! When we thought of doing Scorpion Shots and the nerves kicked in she said \"When in Vegas\" so we jumped in!!  $20 Bottomless Mimosas until 2:00pm Saturday and Sunday was the best deal we found while in town.   This will be a spot we visit on every trip now!!"}
{"text":"Super happy with the portion size and the food. My bf and I came here and were happy to see that the house margaritas were a check in special. They were sweet and not too strong which is good for me. And definitely gets you ready for some nachos. We also had the lobster beer batter tacos which had an awesome mango salsa. Our server Tuesday was super tight! We will go back next time we are in the mood for a good meal. Definitely a good weekend spot."}
{"text":"REALLY yummy & flavorful vegan nachos; their chicken DOES taste like chicken! I don't have pictures since my bf and I were hungry and just devoured it on the Megabus. He got the Vegan Chick'n Nachos ($16.50) and I got the Vegan Fajita Bowl ($13.95).   The overall portions are filling, worth for Vegas price. We both had to take a break and finish it a few hours later lol. A must visit for vegans in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Last night I along with 7 of my friends and family had the pleasure of having a \"special tasting event\" here at Nacho Daddy.  I had won the this event through a auction that \"Goodie 2 Shoes\" foundation held in May. We had no idea what to expect, all of us thought we were gonna get some tequilas that we never heard of and a bunch of different kinda NACHOS.  Boy were we wrong... What we got was a 4 course meals paired with a tequila cocktail. Most of us who have been to ND in the past just go for nachos-n-drinks.  I'm not sure if they have the items that we had on their regular menu but just knowing they are capable of preparing this menu and executing it to perfection just say a lot of the restaurant. They even made accommodations for 1 of the party members who is vegan and had a special menu. Her food was identical to the rest but made of vegan ingredients. Compliments to the Chef de Cusine.  I'm not gonna explain each dish but i will say it was ALL delicious (will post pics).  Now, i dunno how one would experience what we did last night but if its something that you wanna try all you have to do is ASK!!!  Special shout out to our host that night \"Sky and Austin\" you guys did a awesome job with presentation and explanation of each course and pairing. Thanks for an amazing experience."}
{"text":"Not too shabby for a quick lunch of enchiladas.  I had the beef enhilada which was perfectly spiced with yummy beans and rice. The free 8oz margarita is just right.  Service is friendly and quick.  It however is not haute cuisine and the ambiance is decidedly hip grunge.  I'd come back with friends."}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  My favorite dish is the queso dip, animal style.  The staff is always very friendly and welcoming particularly at the bar.  Nacho Daddy has become my Saturday hangout for waching college football.  Stop by for one of their famous scorpion shots!"}
{"text":"EAT HERE!!!!!!! EAT HERE!!!!!! Either location is good downtown or strip. Those Fiesta nachos are CRAZY!!!! Wings aka WANGSSSS r so good and its just a plain wing so sauce or n e thing just grilled. Nacho Daddy we need u in NYC. Follow @jackies_food_jaunts for more vegas and ny eats. We had an african american waiter from LA who was DOPE!!. Loved him. So good we had to tell the manager. Food so good we ate here twice and I don't like to eat at the same place more than once during a single trip on vaca but this place was like CRACK hahaha. Dined with a group of 6 ladies in oct. check in with yelp and get a free marg which my homies said it was one of the best drinks they had on the trip."}
{"text":"Not what I expected the food was horrible. Rubio's is even better than this maybe even taco bell ugh. They also took forever with the check I was ready to go after the horrible meal."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I live in Portland, OR, which is often referred to as Vegan Mecca. We have vegan restaurants for pretty much any kind of food you can think of. Not a single place in town has nachos that even hold a candle to Nacho Daddy. My husband and I STILL talk about the meal we had at NachoDaddy and it was 10 months ago. We also recommended it to everyone we know who is going to Vegas.   The server was super knowledgeable of the menu, and took a minute to show us where to find the vegan menu and explained what could be made vegan upon request.   I had the Loaded Nachos and my husband had the Spicy Chick'n burrito. Both were amazing. I want to try every vegan option they have."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the restaurant is spectacular, but the quality of the food wasn't up to my standard. The nachos that we ordered was chicken and it was shredded like cheese. Overall, I wouldn't return to this restaurant but if you want a quick appetizer or a drink you should try them."}
{"text":"Really good food and they have a pretty large menu. They have quite a few different kinds of nachos plus regular Mexican food and breakfast. I had the supreme nachos but without beef. The chicken ones look great, too, so I would love to try those next time. The nachos were really good and big enough either to share or eat on your own, depending how hungry you are. The service is really good, too, so can't beat that."}
{"text":"We have a favorite place at home for nachos, but now that we've been here we're really sad there isn't one where we live! They stay true to their \"no dry chip\" slogan. Loaded with meat and beans and not over doing it with cheese. The perfect nachos!!! The tamales were delicious as well and even if you don't have room for dessert, still order the apple pie nachos. They'll be gone so fast!!"}
{"text":"Awesome margaritas. They have a cool af scorpion tank.They also have scorpion shots-which is cool. Very gourmet nachos- but also other food like enchiladas and burritos if you're not into nachos. Awesome good stuff- the Shrimp nachos are the best."}
{"text":"Its our first time here.  We really enjoyed it!  Based on the reviews, we tried the filet nachos and the spicy shrimp nachos. Both were good but  spicy! My teen got 3 small corn beef tacos and she said, \"These are amazing!\" We even bought a t-shirt! But even though the price tag says $15, the server tried to charge me $20 for a shirt. When I disputed it she said it rings up at $20. She was not willing to adjust, no matter what - even when the hostess agreed with me. She eventually got the check adjusted but it took forever to get our check,  and then again forever to get my change.   I was at the hostess waiting. Crazy! 10% tip that time.  Usually I pay 25% but I don't reward attitude. We will be back, though.  Free margarita when you check in with an entree order. Nice! The guacamole app. Was a good size and really delicious.  I bet if you came here,  you'd enjoy it."}
{"text":"Stop by last night after checking in at are hotel. After being treated like crap by the customer service in the hotel we decided to grab some dinner. I'm so HAPPY we went to Nacho Daddy's. The Service was amazing but the food was even better. I tried the Thai chicken nachos some of the best nachos I've ever had. My husband had the pork tacos and fillet mignon tacos both options are tasty. After having a horrible start to are vacation I can say Nacho daddy's turned are horrible day into a great night. Will definitely come back. As we left a group was going into the restaurant next door and my husband yelled your making the wrong choice and told them to try Nacho daddy's instead. DEFINITELY WORTH TRYING a new Vegas must..."}
{"text":"I dig it! Nacho Daddy kept coming up in my gluten free and vegetarian friendly searches (my friends are GF, I am veg). I didn't think we would end up going, but it was actually our first meal this trip in Vegas!  First and foremost--this place was HARD to find. It was listed as being in the miracle mile mall, but you actually have to enter from outside. Once we were outside, getting back to planet hollywood was no issue at all, but yeah, just a good note. If you are coming from the strip and facing the walgreens attached to the mall, you want to go down the block on the right, i think its 2 blocks.  We started off with a pitcher of skinny spicy margaritas. That isn't on the menu, but they were able to do it for us which was legit. Those margaritas were good and a great way to get the weekend rolling.  We had vegetarian queso, quite tasty. I wanted to get nachos with also ordering queso, I figured I should reign it in and I got Chick'n tacos. Anytime I can get fake meat at a restaurant I do, and this did not disappoint.  Very much recommend for a fun, casual meal."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend coming here of you are in Vegas. It's not far off the strip and well worth it. The margaritas were very good. Food was amazing. Staff was super friendly. The environment is laid back and relaxing"}
{"text":"So tonight my family and I visited \"Nacho Daddy\" in Summerlin. I ordered from the vegan menu I ordered the skinny dip needless to say it was delicious. My baby girl ordered plain wings from the appetizer menu and they brought out winds with buffalo sauce on them. Then I ordered the vegan street tacos the \"avocado\" ones and they put Shrum in it. The manager said he would take  the wings off of the menu and I'm waiting for the receipt. I informed the waiter of the shrimp in my vegan tacos and he offered to replace but I respectfully declined. It's one thing for our family to wait forever for our order but then the order want correct either was shameful to say the least. Don't visit if you are vegan. Apparently they have a distaste for vegans."}
{"text":"Worst service in a very long time, and we will never return!! They had the bartender doubling as a server, and he took our order and never came back. When a runner finally dropped our appetizer (after dinner arrived and only after we reminded them), it tasted like it had been refrigerated since last week. My dinner came missing items and with incorrect sides. I asked for sparkling water and got soda water from the bar gun. We sat without napkins because no one bothered to stop by to check on us. I was finished after a few bites and it was obvious that I was and needed service, which took another several minutes of looking annoyed to get someone's attention. I asked for a to-go box and you'd think we'd get a server to ask about dessert or the check, but nope we had to flag them down for the check. I actually walked to the bar to pay because I refused to wait while they all stood around talking any longer. We are fantastic tippers, but they're lucky I even paid for my meal! Btw, the bar was near empty and the restaurant had plenty servers for the small amount of diners...they were not busy...and its obvious they never will be!! Bottom line, terrible service and subpar food (took nothing home). Management needs to get it together."}
{"text":"Highly recommend if you're from out of state. I ordered the Supreme and it ended up being bigger than I thought, which I'm glad I was sharing. It didn't disappoint in taste. The chips stayed crunchy and the toppings warm.  Our server was Aly who was really cool."}
{"text":"The bacon and cheese enchiladas were amazing! The open patio/ bar layout is so inviting.  Service was a bit scatterbrained, but perhaps it's because she said she doesn't usually work the morning shifts.  Either way, the food was awesome, and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"First off. Our server Jake is awsome! Got everything right. My hubby got a carnitas and steak taco combo. He didn't like the steak and Jake made sure to get him the taco he did like. He did not have to do that. My hubby is picky AF. Lol. Then the prize. My Nachos!!! We're awsome! I ordered the Buffalo Nachos. Vegan style!! Omg so so so so delish! Not on the Menu so ask them to Veganize it! The picture. Look at the picture!!!!!!!!!! Wow! I'm in Vegan heaven. Thank you Nacho Daddy and kudos to Jake who is a great waiter!"}
{"text":"Desk makes awesome margaritas! They have a full vegan menu which is a great find on the strip!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a fast & furious happy hour on a Monday afternoon at NotYoDaddy, and were pleased with the freshness of the viddles and potency of the libations without being overly sweet. NotYoDaddy could've been content to be lame, them being located on the strip(kinda) but totally showed up to work with pride. We had queso, margaritas, and a Pacifico to start out our afternoon of debauchery in Vegas.    We were slightly slowed up by fiending out on the queso that was super rich, but was garnished with sliced serranos, onion, tomato and jalapenos that provided a little acidity to cut through the fat, but only made it easier to shove in our faces so vigorously, therefore making us exhausted but still scraping out the little plastic molcajete that it came to us in. We still had a bit of sense at that time and ordered some happyhour taquitos, chimichangas, and a Kale entree salad from the regular menu to go along with the 4 fritas (frozen margaritas) and 5 tequila shots we each had over the next 90 or so minutes bellied up to the bar. Needless to say, it was hammertime in wifeypoo&markypoo's head but managed to make it back to the Cosmo with some to-go leftover nibbles in hand. We paid a paltry 82ish pesos americanos and tipped our cracker-jack bar attendant 30 buckarinos for recognizing that she was dealing with 2 happyhour true play-uhz like your humble narrator and his beautiful lady. MOS DEF will be back for another happyhour at Nacho Daddy's. We were quite pleased with ourselves for doing our Yelp  homework prior, but were even more pleased with N.D. (Smileyface)"}
{"text":"If you happen to be on the Vegas strip this place kills it with their brunch and beer/michelata specials!   The food is always fresh and full of flavor. I can't remember the name of the bartender the day we visited, but she was so helpful with assisting us with menu and drink selections.  I love how they have 10 different types of nachos!!!! Yasssss!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy...is daddy. I had the best taco salad of my life there and they had an entire vegan menu. SO SO good 10/10. I wish they had locations in AZ! I think it would do well there!"}
{"text":"This place was great. We were greeted and seated right away. It had a sports bar atmosphere without being so loud but still had a restaurant feel. Our server was Dezi and she was great and gave great recommendation on what to order. We had the filet mignon tacos. It was soooo good. We will be going back..."}
{"text":"Gio is great!!! Great customer service, very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Food is great. Queso dip is delicious. Definitely a great local find!"}
{"text":"Nacho portion was big enough to share. Salsa and guacamole tasted fresh. Delicious."}
{"text":"I got the filet mignon nachos and they were very good. With a meat as good as filet mignon, I do wish I could have had it without the spicy sauce on it, but it was still delicious. When I was typing delicious, it auto corrected to ferocious, which I feel is appropriate as well."}
{"text":"So we found this place yesterday and it was really good so we came back again... We had the nacho average burger nachos and the Lobster and Crab nacho, both were really yummy... Service was good and our food came out quick.. Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Tiffany was an amazing server! Drinks and nachos were awesome. Dessert was delicious!  Definitely will come back!  Back again. This time with Audre the fabulous Redhead.  Amazing service!  Took such great care of us!!!"}
{"text":"Best place for yummy drinks and late night snacks!! My favorite place on Fremont. Don't forget the all day breakfast and the awesome waitstaff."}
{"text":"Definitely not five stars, but it deserves more than four. Solid on all fronts - pretty good food, solid house margarita, and above average service. The food (wet burrito without meat) was genuinely good, but there was no magic in it. That's the only thing that kept it from getting five stars."}
{"text":"My wife and I came for lunch. Ordered a tamale and a quesadilla. The tamale was not good and the quesadilla was only passable. If we come again will try their specialty - nachos, but based on this experience we'll probably stay away.   The atmosphere is nice, though the seat in our booth was torn.   The 2 star rating is mainly for the good, friendly service."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place before going. We were in the mood for Mexican food and were on the strip. The food was good, we had the burger nachos for appetizer, they were delicious, gooey cheese and beef almost on every chip. I had the grilled fish tacos for my entree, again solid, they were not cheap with the filets. The soft flour tortillas were cooked alittle to make them crispy, and the mango salsa was a nice touch. My friend had the smothered burrito, it looked very good. Neither one of us could finish our meals. There was only one thing preventing this restaurant from a 5 star rating and that was the service. The server did not write down our order, even though I asked him if he could remember everything including the modifications we ordered. He assured me \"I got this\", needless to say the app came out wrong. Other then that he was friendly and nice. I would definitely recommend this place as a causal place to visit when u don't want to pay the outrageous prices they charge in other restaurants on the strip."}
{"text":"Thank you so much Jovanny! You made tab and my day so much better. After along and stressful day at work disappear! The food and drinks are amazing. Can't wait to come back soon. I hope your manager knows what an amazing employee you are Jovanny!"}
{"text":"BOOKER. IS. THE. MAN!!! You want great drinks? Amazing service?! Hilarious, super nice, cares about giving you the best experience possible. He is the reason we keep coming back! Ask for him, seek him out, talk to him. He rocks. Everything.  Every time!!!!"}
{"text":"I Love my nachos! So glad I took the time to come by Nacho Daddy's. Great food. Also had a white peach margarita, it was made with perfection. I am a happy camper!"}
{"text":"One of the worst places I have ever experienced.  My husband and I ventured in on Saturday, St. Patrick's day.  The noise level was so bad I could not even hear myself think, let alone hear anyone else.  We asked the server if they could turn the noise down and complied.  Momentarily it was becoming pleasant, then someone, I believe the (young) Gen. Manager, turned it back up.  If this is a bar, they should advertise it as such.  I have been to sports bars before, at night, and have never experienced such annoying, loud noise.  The food was nothing exceptional and I would not go back, if you paid me to."}
{"text":"Bomb.com!   Street tacos were good the first time I came, second time they were a little dry but everything else was great!"}
{"text":"We were excited to see this new location of Nacho Daddy!  Our service was AMAZING! Our waiter was on point every second, even though it was very clear that he had just been slammed with 5 tables. It did not matter, he did not miss a beat!   Food- Everything tasted really fresh, came quickly, all being delivered by friendly food runners. Was it mind shattering Mexican food? No, but it was all really good.  My biggest obstacle is the price point. All through my college years I survived on big delicious burritos because they were super cheap. So in my brain, I think Mexican food should be at least slightly inexpensive.  We ordered 1 appetizer - Queso Dip- It was good. 3 entrees- 2 burritos and a plate of nachos. 2 soft drinks, and a single beer. Our check with tip was $100! - OUCH! I could name 8 places in LV that would be as good and 1/2 that price.  I would go back, if it was suggested. But, honestly, I am not sure I would suggest it myself."}
{"text":"Myself & 2 friends came here after our shifts (all of us are bartenders&one is primarily a server.) I have been in the industry for over 10 years..we expect good service. Its super frustrating when you've spent $75 on 4 beers, 1 appetizer, & 1 entree,& dessert. That's a lot of money to spend to be sitting in an empty restaurant for over 2 hours, unable to get refills, napkins, etc..Service today was bad..sorry. Alex was our server, 2 of us showed up before the 3rd. We sat for about 10 minutes before Alex came by&said have you been helped..we said no..he said, \"ok are you ready to order then?\" We told him we'd start with 3 waters as we were waiting for our friend but we'd be getting drinks as well..It took 5 minutes after that to get 3 waters..& we were sitting right by the kitchen entrance&service well..that's crazy.He spilt one of the waters on the table NO BIG DEAL, I told him not to worry about it, it happens BUT WE cleaned it up before he got back with a towel.. never brought us napkins for our food after that. My friends got two micheladas&i got a beer with fresh limes squeezed..something most Mexican restaurants do nbd..well apparently it was a big deal to the bartender who awkwardly looked at our table&then complained about having to squeeze extra limes in my beer..look I do get it, being that I bartend too&people ring in funky stuff but hey you're a bartender and people want what they want..plus at least you had a cool lime squeezer to make it easier, my job makes me hand squeeze them..so you had it pretty easy the commentary wasn't really necessary especially since I could hear you at my table. Not cool. Anyways, my $9 beer was great thanks.Dip trio was bomb.com another server walked by&asked if we wanted more salsa, we said yes..it never came..&our server was unfortunately MIA. We were planning on sharing an appetizer&!an entree with the intent of getting another entree after if we were still hungry...but that never happened because we were so annoyed by the end of the nachos we said screw it, it wasnt worth the wait. I was going to get food to go for my boyfriend as well but I didn't want to wait any longer. Again, so frustrating cause there were literally 6 tables in the entire restaurant If that includes the bar top. We ordered vegan nachos for our entree since I don't eat meat..I've ordered these every time I come in but these were off. Smaller portion than usual & it was missing the green tomatillo looking sauce..whatever still ate them all anyways..about 3/4 through our meal our server reappeared from the room behind the curtain..guess he was eating at the same time, still check on your table while your eating or doing sidework just take 2 seconds then go back to whatever..when he finally did come back though I asked for more chips&salsa..my friend ordered another beer and my other friend ordered dessert just so we could get it in since we didn't know when we'd see him again..she was gonna order some ceviche as well but as she went to tell him &he started walking away so she said screw it..We got up&grabbed our own napkins&hot sauce by the way..We had our nacho plates&everything piled up on the table for SOMEONE to take off the table, no one did. Table touches&prebussing is so important it just makes it seem like you care even if you don't..It took 15 minutes after that for our chips and salsa to come out. FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR CHIPS AND SALSA..friggen crazy.&then dessert two seconds after that. I didn't want dessert I just wanted to nibble on the chips&salsa.... but the fried ice cream looked good..During dessert, Alex came over&asked if he could close us out because he was getting ready to leave... we said yeah..we tipped him $10 instead of the $14 we should have left but none of us were even stoked to leave $10 considering we weren't happy with our service&still left kinda hungry&upset. my friends&I were so frustrated that we were sitting there with no water refills & that we had spent so much time there just waiting around that I decided not to get anything else to go even though I knew my boyfriend was at home & hungry. Needless to say I was disappointed. I was stoked to go there after work today&after today's visit I'm not sure I will be back to this location which sucks cause its right down the street from my work& the food is so good. Another younger couple walked out before we got our food because they had been waiting so long to get their drinks..I saw quite a few people standing around near the keg cooler, I never once saw a manager on duty..I dunno if they were in the room behind the curtain too or if it was maybe the frumpy girl wearing a hoodie or what but that just isn't a good sign. The restaurant was too slow for service to be so lousy&for no one to even notice that people weren't having a good experience."}
{"text":"Definitely start with the guava margarita!  Good thing Zach recommended it! The food is very fresh. I was rushing so I order cerviche and guacamole and chips. Guacamole was excellent,  the cerviche was good and different than most. I would only change one thing more shrimp in the ceviche. Request Zach he is very accommodating!"}
{"text":"YES! Like most, we were drawn to Nacho Daddy for the amazing name! Our entire experience was great! A quick check in prompted a free drink with the purchase with an appetizer which was a great start. Very Friendly, attentive service made us feel extremely welcome. Now to the reason we were there. NACHOS! who doesn't like nachos? Especially from a place that is named after them! So we gave their giant menu a long look and of course ended up getting one of their Nacho Options. I couldn't believe how many Nacho options they had! We went with the Pulled Pork Nachos and Knew we had made the right decision when they were set in front of us. I don't think we had a single chip that was left without toppings! Not to mention the serving size was more than enough or two people. Two drinks and a meal for $30 in Vegas is unheard of. We will absolutely return and try something new. The group we went with was sick of hearing about how much we loved this place. If you are on the fence at all, i hope this review pushes you to try this wonderful restaurant. If you have even close to as good of an experience as we had then I am convinced you will be thrilled with your decision."}
{"text":"Great food. Great drinks. Great location. Service was amazing. Drink the scorpion shot."}
{"text":"The vegan tacos are worth every penny. If you are vegan and need to get your tacos on and be full and satisfied and happy and excite your taste buds this is a must visit place"}
{"text":"We tried Nacho daddy for the first time because we had a Groupon. Our server was nice although service was kind of slow for lunch time. I had gringos tacos 1 chicken and 1 beef they were pretty good the only thing I didn't like was that they use cheese queso instead of shredded cheese. It sucks that chips and salsa are extra we are used to eating at Juans flaming fajitas and chips and salsa are included not to mention soup is also included. I don't eat beans so I did not have them I only had the rice and it left a lot to be desired I had to cover it in salsa. The rest of the menu looks pretty decent so I'm sure we'll be back to try it again."}
{"text":"AMAZING. I feel like that's all there is to say about this place. It was SO good. Granted, nacho's just happen to be my favorite food and I've never been anywhere like this.  I didn't even bother looking past the nacho section of the menu because they had so many cool options to choose from. The only thing that turned me off a little bit was the price, UNTIL I actually got my food and realized that for the quality and quantity it's totally worth it! I had no idea my nachos would be stacked so high. Pictures just don't do them justice. It's most definitely worth a stop, especially if you're a nacho fanatic like I am. You won't regret it.   There's some appetizer trio with salsa, guacamole, and queso that they light a little fire under to keep it all warm and melty. Oh my goodness. Quite possibly the best queso I've had. I would most definitely recommend it. Also, the white peach margarita is wonderful!   Definitely wishing this was a chain in Texas, but then again I doubt it would be this good if it was."}
{"text":"Bad bad texmex. Guess I'm spoilt in Austin. If you want bottled taste sauces on precooked meat and then on chips, this could be for you! Service (at the bar) very sporadic...   Hey, ya come to the strip you get bar fast food .. my bad ... Adding two stars for the follow up by mgmt!"}
{"text":"We kept walking by.  Then since it was within walking distance we stopped in.  To our surprise great wings good salsa and the kids quesadillas were hot and good.  The free margaritas for Checking in didn't hurt.  The bill rolled less than expected. I'm good!"}
{"text":"My Supreme Tostada Nachos, were just that- Supreme!! Oh so good with just the right Nacho topping-to-chip balance ratio!! Thank you Nacho Daddy Summerlin- we loved the Pink Chips for  October! #breastcancerawareness"}
{"text":"This place is by far the best vegan food ive had in las vegas hands down! We had the chickn tacos,  skinny dip  and chickn fajitas our first night and man was our mind blown!!!! We also have micheladas and they were bomba! We were so excited to find such a vegan friendly place. We travel alot and we always have such a hard time finding vegan friendly places. At the end of our meal i got the vegan chocolate cake. Although no one could tell me what it was made of besides that there was oreos in it which the bartender informed us that oreos are indeed vegan me and my husband looked at eachother like no way! But a quick google search informed us that it was false bummed! But the cake was still delicous ;)   Our second night we had crispy avocado street tacos, spicy burrito and the grilled corn with sour cream instead of mayo and the lovely waitress gave me the option to have the corn cut off the cob! I even had a non alcoholic michelada this time and it tasted just as great! I loved every dish at this place im super bummed we live so far away. Nacho daddy has a loyal customer anytime i come to vegas!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really cool here! The food isn't bad but fairly average Americanized Mexican food. The drink deal are pretty good though, especially during happy hour. Overall, nothing super special but also not a bad place to go if you're looking for a bar environment with okay food"}
{"text":"Amanda is awesome, she came to check on us often, very attentive!  love the atmosphere! Our food came out quick. I had the chilaquiles to go along with my free house margarita.  The food was great!"}
{"text":"Had such a great experience at nacho daddy!! The drinks are insane our server Ari recommended the sunrise bliss margarita it was sooo good !! She also hooked us up with coupons so we will be back for breakfast tomorrow !!"}
{"text":"Arnold was very nice and put up with our late night shenanigans. Good drinks and food here!"}
{"text":"One of the best margaritas I've ever had. Nachos were insane. Fun bartenders, can't go wrong with this place for a chill lunch or a late night spot to crush Mexican."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food - and tequila just as much. I was happy to find this place near the Miracle Mile shopping area.  I was happy to learn they had specials on both on a sunny Tuesday in November.  Service was so- so.  The place was pretty empty and the server seemed hungover and dis-interested.  Luckily she did tell me about the taco and drink specials - 3 tacos for 5$ - YAY and 2 for 1 top shelf tequila!  Yay again!  Corn tortillas are a little thick and chewy for my taste, but I like that they have lobster and crab, both fresh and well seasoned.  I will be back to try the Nachos!"}
{"text":"The nachos were cold with clumpy cheese upon arrival. Not to mention the order was placed at 4:25 and didn't arrive until 6:52 p.m. I was starving and quite perturbed."}
{"text":"The service is usually good, everyone seems to be friendly and on top of things - but like many chains the food is mediocre and the price point seems high for what you're getting. However, they do have vegan options which gives them street cred in my book.  I've been here twice and tried the fish tacos, two different types of nachos, and a burger. The food is fine, and the atmosphere tends to be a little bit noisy with low lighting. Overall, this isn't a place you go out of your way to check out, but it's not terrible."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed this restaurant several times in the last year or so. Food is great, service is excellent. Thanks Ryan for impeccable service today. The only disappointment is that they changed their coffee from Lion's Head to a local brand. I would gladly pay more to have an option to have Lion's Head."}
{"text":"It's only my first time here at Nacho Daddy it was a positive experience. Great server named Alex, fantastic food and a fun atmosphere. The Golden Knights game was on and everyone was in full fanatic mode and yelling at each goal. It was great fun. I had the chicken fajita salad and it was delicious and filling. Everything was fresh. My friend had the vegan chicken nachos and she really enjoyed them. Yes, they have a vegan menu and they make the vegan cheese on sight. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"I must say that it is an everlasting adventure trying to find a decent priced vegan restaurant. However, this location at nacho daddy is amazing. I've never had a bad experience once and I am a repeat customer every Monday night when kids eat free. The staff is extraordinary from the hostess to the food runners, even the bartenders have brought missing items to our tables. It's clear that nobody has that \"it's not my job mentality.\" The vegan food is amazing and we always eat our weight in bottomless chips & salsa! They make everything in house including their new special vegan chocolate cake. (Which is to die for!) Please keep this item on the menu forever!   Honestly this is an amazing place to eat overall. If you're looking for something convenient, tasty, in a good atmosphere this is definitely the place to come."}
{"text":"This place is located right outside of Planet Hollywood. I went here Sunday night around 11 pm because not many other places where open. The service was good the food on the other wasn't that great. Another thing that bothered me was that they took forever to make the food when there weren't many other people there. I had the seafood enchiladas they where okay i couldn't even taste the seafood. Overall not a good experience and I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Amazing places deserves the proper recognition.  Without a doubt the food and drinks are amazing.  Perhaps an under statement but I want to talk about the staff.  My husband and I visited  the establishment and had Huck as our server.  I saw another review that mentioned him...I can confirm he is excellent.  I was very impressed.    As consumers we take a chance when eating in restaurants.  We were watching a special on tv that highlighted  restaurants that was rodent infested.  I was disgusted and even more hesitant about eating out.  Then we meet Reuben and Oscar... the head Chef and assistant.  They were walking out and we stopped them to give compliments on the food.  They thanked us and what was more surprising ...invited us to tour the kitchen.  Keep in mind, I just watched the show so I really was hesitate about going. Well, the pride they take in what they do was shown in the cleanliness and organization of that kitchen and prep area.  Some faith restored...so impressed we ate there the next day and will tell everyone to visit when in Vegas.  Good job guys...continue to take pride in what you do!!!"}
{"text":"Average Nachos or slightly under average. Margarita sin Sal, under average. The mix is too sweet and too much fake lime juice (pre-made caddilacs). $14 CADILLAC, $15 Patron represado to chill the premix sweetener so 29bux for a less than average Rita!  16.95 nachos with ground beef and cheese wiz. If I were you, I'd pass.  Kind of sucked. Probably stays open cuz of LA Quinta hotel in same complex."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service, fun ambience.  I highly recommend the Thai chicken nachos if you happen to like sweet, peanuty, tangy Thai flavors. The portion size is generous and can be easily split between two. I like the fact that the nachos were filling without leaving you feeling like you ate a bowl of greasy cheese. We also ordered a kale salad which was fresh and offered a nice balance to the hearty nachos.   The place was spacious and had a fun but low key vibe. I also loved the music videos from the early 2000s that were playing in the background!  Overall, I had a experience. The prices are reasonable, food was delicious (no, I wasn't drunk), and the service was friendly. I would definitely come back.  Also, don't forget to check in on yelp for a free house margarita!"}
{"text":"As a new LV resident, and someone who works right near this location, I REALLY hoped this place would be awesome, but was really disappointed with the experience.  Brought my two buddies here, after assuring them it would be awesome based on the the reviews.  Saturday night, around 8 not too crowded.  We had a waitress, who though very nice, was largely absent after seating us. When our food order arrived, we spent about 5 minutes waiting (and later searching) for her because we had 1) no plates 2) no silverware 3) our food order was wrong.  When we explained that we ordered the nachos with no tomatoes or onions (which were all over the nachos), she asked if she wanted to send it back.  We explained that we don't WANT to send it back, but need to send it back because we had someone in the party who can't do those items, and she begrudgingly abliged.  No apology, nothing.  The first and only thing should have been an apology and an offer to replace, we were very clear in our order..  When we were eventually brought the plates, they were soaking wet, as if right out g the washer..  we had to wipe them all down.  The food was good, but the service just RUINED the experience- I am no longer, according to my buddies, allowed to pick where we go out to eat , that's how bad this was- damn!   Edit: 2nd time was much better.  Granted it was just me at the bar but the bar tender was very attentive and food was great.  I will come back and hopefully add another star (or 2)!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Great atmosphere and tons of choices. Very good customer service. Jovany the server was the best. He was so helpful and personable. Definitely come here when you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant. Vince was our waiter and was great.  Portions are huge. Fresh brewed ice tea. Ceviche was fresh and tasted amazing. The fajitas steak and shrimp were so delicious. Update: Okay so finished the meal.... well most of it highly recommend all of it. Everyone around me seems as satisfied as I was.  Manager even stopped to ask if everything was ok.  Will be my go to spot when I work Las Vegas area from now on."}
{"text":"We ordered the Shrimp tacos and filet mignon nachos, both were  good but not great. Service was good and we got our food quickly. Maybe our expectations were just too high after the high reviews but with all the other really good places to eat in Vegas I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Vegan menu and they donate a meal for every entree purchased. Definitely the best loaded vegan nachos/queso I have had. My non-vegan fiance even said he couldn't tell it wasn't vegan."}
{"text":"Great meal and drinks - best vegan Mexican I've ever had and shout out to Taylor - good service too"}
{"text":"Best nachos I've ever had! The Thai chicken nachos are worth the trip.  I will never visit Vegas again without stopping at Nacho Daddy. The service was great,  the atmosphere was relaxed,  and the nachos were DELICIOUS! ... not sure about \"never a dry chip,\" though, but they are so good they get a pass."}
{"text":"This place is really warm and inviting !! Super great severs ! Ryan was amazing and very knowledgeable ! (: the Margaritas are delirious ! And so are the nachos ! Best ever !!!"}
{"text":"We came to this spot on New Years Day with high hopes from all of the Yelp reviews and after seeing numerous signs posted throughout The Miracle Mile Shops. The place was pretty quiet when we arrived, perhaps because people were still recovering from all of the excitement from the night before, or maybe because the location of the restaurant is off the beaten path... it sits on East Harmon a little away from the corner of Las Vegas Blvd, getting overshadowed by the infamous Taco Bell Cantina. We opted to sit at the bar and was greeted by the bartender immediately. We kept it simple and decided to share an order of Ultimate Supreme Nachos. They were good, not overly outstanding, and could've been warmer. I do appreciate that there was a really good toppings-to-chips ratio and the bartender even offered to bring a few extra chips, if needed. Pricewise, it was a little more than I'd prefer to pay for nachos but given that it was a restaurant near The Strip, the higher price is pretty much expected. Perhaps we will return again on the next trip and try out the seafood nachos."}
{"text":"I got the vegan nachos and a blended blueberry margarita. PERFECTION. Service was also great and quick!"}
{"text":"Service was fab here! The food was okay, we ordered off the happy hour menu and tried the sloppy joes and their burger nachos. It was pretty basic nothing to rave about. We also ordered a couple drinks, I personally really enjoyed their strawberry margarita. Added star for awesome servers, they were super attentive!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Service was slow, but the filet mignon nachos and chicken tacos were unreal. The wife and I were blown away by the amazing flavors. Probably going back tomorrow, and will be sure to stop here on all future vegas trips."}
{"text":"Great place for taco Tuesday & classic margaritas! Our server Mark was very polite & exceeded expectations. We would definitely return."}
{"text":"We stopped in Nacho Daddy as a first meal once we arrived in Vegas. Mostly because it was opened and had no wait/wasn't too busy at the time. Staff was cool and friendly. Yelp checking gets you a free margarita but it was mostly sour mix. Not a hint of tequila.  We both had Huevos Rancheros which was quite a bit of food but not the best overall. Still, thankful for refuge from the chilly morning and away from crowds.  Or so we thought.  For some reason, the two large doors (think wide garage doors) on both floors were opened. This was around 11am and the temp was around 40 degrees. The entire restaurant was quickly  colder, forcing many patrons and some staff to put their jackets/coats/sweaters/scarves back on. WTF? And nobody was sitting outside or appeared to want to sit outside.   We were told by out waitress that a single person asked to have the doors opened so they were opened. Which, didn't make sense. So everyone else must suffer and have their hot food chilled? Why wouldn't they just go sit on the patio outside?  We didn't want to be a pain but it was getting to the point of possibly leaving before our food arrived which I didn't want to do. We pushed a bit more once our food arrived and she then said that the owner usually opens it when he arrives (he wasn't there yet) and she'll see what she can do to get it closed back up. They were closed about 5 minutes later and we all rejoiced. Actually, only the downstairs door was closed. About 15 minutes later, it was reopened and thankfully by then we were finishing up.  I get patio weather and wanting to draw in the crowds but it was FORTY DEGREES. Most everyone wanted to eat inside and the hottest part of the day had not hit yet. At the very least, please take the temperature into consideration - during the winter - before freezing out your customers.  Decent, affordable place to grab a bite but nothing I'd be rushing back to."}
{"text":"I almost sent back the vegan chicken tacos cause they tasted like chicken. Vegan options galore and amazing service. Desi our server was such a doll. Super accommodating and a real sweet heart."}
{"text":"Sat here alone while I waited for friends to get in and the staff was super friendly. Amazing Margaritas!"}
{"text":"Food was great, and HUGE!!!!! Really awesome place, can't wait for Golden Knights games to start back up this will be my go to place to watch and eat!!!! Lee was a great server and attentive, as well as very friendly! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place! Music playing .... and music videos. Nice touch. Great food. Good service!"}
{"text":"The enchilada nachos are sooo good. We got half green and half red sauce. Incredible!"}
{"text":"We recently dined at Nacho Daddy as we saw it while driving to an event earlier in the day. -Atmosphere was great -Menu & Happy Hour menu had awesome and creative options -Super friendly and knowledgeable server and server assistant  When we got there it was only our table of 4 and two other small groups and our server was great. about 5-6 more tables arrived within 10 minutes but no one else was helping on the floor. The poor girl could not keep up with everyone, especially during happy hour. She was constantly apologizing to every table as she was not able to service everyone in a timely manner. Also, there wasn't really anyone sitting at the bar but for some reason drinks ordered by tables took FOREVER to be made & delivered.  I feel as if the restaurant would have bee staffed better or had the support of management it would have been a much smoother & enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite. Happened to be happy hour. $4 nachos and $5 margaritas! Sierra was my bartender she recommended the bbq chicken nachos and they where amazing! Good drinks great food and even better service."}
{"text":"Jovany was such a gent. Made wonderful suggestions n his recommendation was spot on. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Servers are always super chill. Quality is great at this location too. Try the vegan chick'n quesadilla or the vegan nachos. The way they marinate and prepare the plant-based chicken makes it very flavorful and the texture is spot on. Non vegan friends love it as well :)!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a hungover lunch. Was immediately seated and our awesome waitress Ari took our orders and the food was out super quick. It was delicious and Ari was always nearby. This was a great lunch choice."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp nachos, they were amazing!! Judy rocks, we were undecided and her recommendations were spot on. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"An excellent place to eat in the heart of the strip. Great nachos, tacos, drinks, and ambiance. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Wanna give big Kuddos to Lindsey for the service she has given us!!  Been in the past 3 weeks and she remembers us and qhat we ordered. Lindsay is a great asset to your company and I belive she goes bove and beyond to take care of of the customer!! Keep up the great work Lindsay!!"}
{"text":"Heading into this establishment there was a scorpion housing container. It was pretty cool! It fit the desert-like ambiance.   The wait-time was relatively accurate.  Our server Vince was very helpful and attentive. The Assistant General Manager also seemed very supportive of his staff when they seemed to get slammed with a lot of customers. I know this because I stopped the AGM to inform him of a small piece of tortilla chip that was inside of my friend's beer flight. He immediately replaced a new one for us.   The Filet Mignon Nachos were amazing. The steak was very tender, and complemented the nachos very well!  Me and my friend just wanted to share those nachos, and it was the perfect size.   If you want to grab a couple brews, and something to snack on, try Nacho Daddy! Overall, great service, great food, and great selections on beers. Our favorite was the House Hefeweizen.   The location of this place is on the outer edge of PH. It neighbors BWW.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place three times from door dash. The food the first time was in the late evening and it was delicious the next too times not so much. I just spent 30$ on two chicken sandwiches that were BURNT to all hell. The dryness would have been a little bit bearable if they didn't forget the aioli sauce on BOTH of them on top of that. Our sandwiches were disgusting. My boyfriend just threw his in the trash. I understand people don't like their job and maybe they have a bad day but I work hard for my money JUST LIKE YOU DO. It's really upsetting to spend that much money on two sandwiches just to throw away in the garbage. I ordered the food 04-14-2018 roughly around 4:40 PM"}
{"text":"DJ is an amazing server, very helpful and knowledgeable. The food was amazing!. I would recommend the filet minon nachos. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Awesome experience. Though it was a little confusing to get to, the whole space is very inviting. Loved the 80s music videos playing on all the screens at the time. Staff was SUPER friendly.   We had the Triple dip to start, it was a great appetizer with queso, guacamole and salsa. We also tried a couple different margarita flavors but personally I loved the mango.   As entrees I had the signature tacos with pork which were gigantic! It comes with two tacos absolutely stuffed with meat. The tortillas were really good and fluffy sort of like Cafe Rio's. My favorite part of the dish may have been the rice it was SO good.   I also tried the buffalo nachos. Definitely would be a good hungover or drunk food but I got pretty full at that point! The last thing we tried was the churro sundae which came with two churros and three scoops of ice cream. I feel like they could have reversed that with two scoops of ice cream and three or four churros. The ice cream seemed to melt before we could get to it.  Overall it was an awesome experience and I think people will have a really good time here. They also have scorpion shots which I witnessed but don't think I'll be participating in. Good times, great food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Nice open kitchen and the was amazing and fresh. Christine was super sweet and helpful. My pork taco was so filling and deliciously topped with carmelized onions. As a tourist I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time there and I got the Supreme Nachos. Huge portion for one person. Couldn't finish the plate, and I love Nachos. I'll definitely be back to try some others. We also got a pitcher of the Daddy's Margarita and that was delicious!"}
{"text":"Free margarita with yelp check and purchase of entree.   Famous queso dip with chips. 8/10.  Really liked it. We ate it all haha.  Fish tacos:  grill 7.2/10  battered 7.6/10.   The grilled was a lil bit over salted .   Smothered burrito: 7/10. Descent burrito. Very large deff. Makes two meals.   Service was good. Shannon was super sweet and helpful. Except she sees imaginary slides at madalay bay pool. No slide shannon! ;-) haha"}
{"text":"Delicious bloody Mary and many yummy foods. We even went there 2x. Once for lunch and once for brunch. Chicken and kale was good and also the nachos! Definitely a good place to try."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy is the BOMB, and a must for munchie's cravings any time you're on the Las Vegas Strip!    We drove up to Vegas this past weekend on a whim for a quick getaway, and after checking into our hotel, our first idea for food was Nacho Daddy!  They stay open until 2 am, so you have plenty of time to pop on by in the evening for some delicious nachos and the other food offerings that they provide.    The nachos themselves are AMAZING, and we love the white queso dip that it comes with - the jalapeños add a great kick to its rich, creamy flavor.  But it has more than just nachos, despite it being its namesake!  The street tacos I ordered here were some of the best I've ever had.  They were full of meat and toppings and very filling!!  The rice and beans were very satisfying as well, so it was an all around delicious meal.    We ordered it to go and ate in the room, but the atmosphere in the dining area is awesome as well, and we've eaten in there before.  It's like a more lively and fun Buffalo Wild Wings!  The prices are also quite reasonable for something on The Strip and for the quality and size of the portions!    I love Nacho Daddy!  I'll definitely be coming back every time I'm in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Spicy Garlic Shrimp Nachos with House Made Spinach Chips were #DELICIOUS! I couldn't help but indulge in the Churro Sundae (Extra Caramel Drizzle). Booker the Bartender was very friendly with excellent customer service! More than likely I'll be eating here for the next three days while in training."}
{"text":"Davor was just a bartender last time I was here. Now he's running things behind the counter. He helped me with my Vegan choice on Vegan monday and made sure my food was out in time. Thanks guy! Gerardo too, thanks!"}
{"text":"Our server was Chase and he was awesome. We had the Thai nachos, lobster/crab/shrimp tacos. It was so good."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy was awesome because of Jovanny. He was awesome. Food was awesome. It was a lituation like no other. I recommend everyone to come in and see Jovanny. Definitely deserves a promotion. I love Vegas more because of him."}
{"text":"Crazy well stocked bar and loved the atmosphere. Was only here for the beer and a quick app but the service is good, the beer cold and the people friendly. Will certainly come back and try the menu"}
{"text":"Yumm yummm yummmmm! I loved the steak nachos! The ceviche was beyond awesome! My husband love love loved the pancake dessert!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!! Incredible food, great music, and the staff is wonderful! Ari is the best bartender..she is friendly, helpful, and made it a great experience! Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Our experience started off poorly because I was very annoyed that we had been ripped off on the street buying the tall frozen cocktails and when we arrived they said we had to leave them by the door. On the Las Vegas Strip, that is a lot of trust to put in the hands of others. The girl said we could chug them otherwise and that wasn't going to happen but it was late and we were starving. I asked if we could put them somewhere out of reach near our table and that was refused and I just feel like this is poor customer service. I was happy to buy a drink there but they clearly didn't care and it said the mood for a poor experience.   I was not overly impressed with the nachos and I was really unimpressed with the skinny margarita. We have been spoiled by having some really fantastic nachos and some delicious margaritas and these were not living up to my expectations. I've had plenty of skinny margaritas that didn't taste like club soda but this one was particularly awful. Our waitress was nice and offered to remake it for me but I just couldn't stomach the mixture with the club soda so she took it off of our bill. I drink vodka club too so this was particularly odd but it just didn't taste like a margarita!  We shared a plate of the nachos and we took advantage of the yelp check-in offer to get a free house margarita but the Nacho Daddy margarita is NOT it so don't be fooled. I guess just ask which is the house - we just paid the $3-4 upgrade fee.   Overly disappointed with the experience and hostess's customer service. I definitely think it's worth trying other options on The Strip"}
{"text":"If you want the best nacho cheese you've ever had, come here. Any nachos are a great choice!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast 3 times while here- was excellent! Food and service was the best! Kimberly and Charlene at the bar were very nice and attentive! Recommend very much!!"}
{"text":"Gave this place 2 more tries on my next Vegas visit. I like the food and the drink. Not bad prices for good food on the strip. The menu selection will make you want to come back and try something else. The signature nachos were a hit with me and my friends.  Pretty sure I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Loved the Nachos, loved the brunch bottomless mimosas, and loved Luz as our waitress."}
{"text":"Love this place, the shrimp nachos my husband added fajita chicken to them,are awesome!"}
{"text":"Davor did us right last time we were here. We walk thru the door and he remembered us from 6 months ago! He took care of us with Great Customer Service again!  Nacho daddy is where it's at!"}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy I believe can be either a hit or miss and this last visit that I just had here which was the second one fell in between the two. I'd received a gift card of some sort to use up before next year and I had a good friend in town and after playing tourist we struck up an appetite. I thought to myself well why not try Nacho Daddy out again.   When we first arrived there was somebody who was standing at the front whom we thought was the server. I inquired with the young lady about taking a table outside and was told that she wasn't the hostess but yet a server.. You know just hanging out I guess. The hostess was off at the bar talking. Interesting.. Anyways while we waited for the hostess to be done I told my friend I would run to the restroom. Came out to only still find him just standing there. The thing I thought was most odd about this was that they weren't even busy so us not being able to be seated right away was throwing me off. Nonetheless we finally were escorted out to one of the table tops outside on the little patio. Weather was great so why not enjoy some great drinks and people watch?  Our server came out, introduced himself and even made some suggestions about some of the drinks. With the check-in on YELP they were offering a free \"house margarita\" which we ended up throwing in a few extra dollars to upgrade it to a more better tequila! Nice touch I have to give it to our server for having a great explanation and knowledge around the different tequilas!  Now with margaritas generally when you order them you are asked with salt, sugar or nothing on the rim. Being so indulged into conversation my friend and I didn't even notice this wasn't asked until we got these margaritas with all this salt haha. No biggie! Manager came around to check in on how everything was going and ended up fixing those again for us this time with no salt. Very much appreciated. Overall score for the drink was a 4/5.  On to the food! Yes! So I've been on this whole seafood kick lately so with that being said I went for the shrimp fajitas for two! Yes.. for 2! I had already made plans to order enough to eat there and then also bring some home. When ordering this for two I got some hesitation from our waiter and a face that all but kind of said \"are you sure\" listen if something says for two and that's what one person orders you have to be careful about having a prejudging tone/expression because it's a great thing I'm not overweight or else I would've felt some type of way like that wasn't necessary regardless if you are trying to make a point that it's a lot of food. Anyways.. The plate came out and sure it was a lot but were there even enough shrimp to warrant that $28.99 price? The jury is still out on that. How did they taste? GREAT! So that's all that matters right? 5/5 for those. My friend ordered the steak nachos and loved every bite.   Overall the visit was pretty decent. You may ask about why 3 stars out of the 5 huh? Well like any other restaurant rule, the food can be damn good but if the service is spotty that can make or break the whole experience. I think that in the start of the visit the area of opportunity could be to ensure you always have somebody at the front hostess station and even if they have to run to the bathroom or help another person whatever the case is, having somebody to fill in for that time frame can go a long way. Perception is reality so having the server who was there just chillin but not helping was off..."}
{"text":"Welp...I gave Nacho Daddy another chance but this time at a different location! This time I went to the one off of Sahara & Fort Apache and guess what? They saved the day on a last minute dinner that I planned for my friend on her birthday.. Well it was more like a happy belated since we were both so busy and this location is most convenient.  When we arrived the place was kind of dead and this was on a Saturday afternoon! Of course with that being said we were seated immediately and our server came over within minutes! Started off with checking In on YELP because they were running a special for a free house margarita when doing so. I always like to upgrade to the premium tequila because why not? Two Cadillac margaritas it is then! I wish I remembered our servers name but he was awesome! Very personable, attentive and made plenty recommendations on the menu.   We started off with the Queso dip and my gosh! This Queso is just amazing! My friend really liked how cool it was that they bring it out with a candle underneath to keep it hot and that whole melting thing as your dipping your chips in.. YUM! After chowing down on that for a bit we were ready to order and because I just loved the sizzling shrimp fajitas from the location on the strip we went ahead and ordered that same dish for 2! You can never go wrong with shrimp fajitas and not to mention they brought everything out in a timely manner. I was a bit apprehensive at first about trying them out again but surely glad I did because my friend enjoyed herself and that's all that mattered! #MissionAccomplishedForTheBirthdayGirl. Kudos to the Sahara/Ft. Apache location. I WILL be back :-)"}
{"text":"I love absolutely love nachos.  They are my favorite meal but I really wasn't feeling it. I probably would of enjoyed putting sliced cheese on a handful of chips and microwaving it. It was my birthday when I had came in with my family. Everyone got their order except my brother which he didn't get until everyone was already almost done eating. Our server was distracted by her boyfriend visiting her so no one got a refill on their drinks nor we were checked on. She was hard to flag down. As much as I love nachos & excited to finally visit this place,  I was very disappointed. I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Jovany was amazing! He took great care of us and we will definitely come back next time we are in Las Vegas. The margaritas are excellent and the nachos are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Super pleased with this place. Was expecting a mass produced, \"get em in, get em out\" experience but ended up going for breakfast two days in a row! The food was really good and quality, service was attentive, and I was impressed because it looks like they do a lot for their community. We got the churro pancake! Say no more, right?! I noticed they have some awesome looking margarita flavors too. Will have to come back for those!"}
{"text":"It was a bit of a walk, but well worth it.  Had a great server (Vince), the food was really good, and the atmosphere was fun. The filet nachos were delicious & I'm really glad we had the cinnamon apple nachos for dessert. Good Marg & relatively good price for the strip."}
{"text":"Chase was the best server and he put up with all our bs and David aka muscles was awesome!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing breakfast here with such exceptional customer service! Ari was a big help with our food and drinks. We had a small incident of some spillage, but they were generous enough to comp my meal with a smile. Matt and Peter were super nice about the whole thing, I honestly am clumsy myself so I wasn't too worried. They went above and beyond to satisfy my needs though and I really appreciate that!! Keep doing y'all thang, because you're doing it right  - Ciara"}
{"text":"First time in. It was 10pm on a Friday. The place was absolutely dead, so we got to sit wherever we wanted ;) our server was very nice, and quick since she didn't have to worry about anybody else.   We ordered nachos, a large beer and a margarita. All three were great, but the prices were a little tough to swallow (pun intended). Don't get me wrong, the margarita was very well done, and the spicy shrimp nachos were excellent as well. The $15 dollar price tag wasn't worth the portion size. Our bill came to $45 or so after taxes, and I just didn't think it warranted what we ordered.   We'll be back again in the future, but I don't think we'll make this a regular stop. I think a price adjustment in the future is probably warranted (I think they've only been open for a week or so) and if so I think we'd come more often.  At the end of the day it's worth a look, and they have a pretty extensive tequila list that might be fun."}
{"text":"Really good food and huuuuuuuuge portions! The staff could check up on us a little more often though. Otherwise it was wonderful!"}
{"text":"I loved the cucumber jalapeño Marg - super spicy and delish! It's a big one! Split the Vegas prime rib nachos - good portion, could've been a little cheesier."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican place to eat and drink. Food is good. I tried Thai nachos and triple dip. The hostess Kristen was very informative and professional. This place is a right place to spend afternoon for quick lunch and drinks.   House margarita frozen drink is good one to try..."}
{"text":"I got suckered into this place by their mail ads for their taco Tuesday's and also had 2 for 1 coupons but forgot to bring it. I'll probably only go back to this place to use the coupons.  We had the the shrimp and carne asada street tacos 3 tacos for $7. The shrimp was popcorn shrimp and tasted like any ordinary popcorn shrimp u can get from your local grocery store. The carne asada tacos you can get cheaper and better taste from a late night taco stand. It doesn't come with any sauces beside tapatio and cholula already on your table. This place is too Americanized and rather go to an authentic Mexican restaurant for the flavor and price."}
{"text":"The vegan chik'n fajitas are life, made me feel like I was omni again! They even set it on fire tableside.   Very complete vegan menu. Even had vegan desserts, I had the richest chocolate cake with raspberries."}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times and each time is better than the last. Will always seated very quickly everyone's always nice and friendly we love coming here on Mondays because it's vegan night and kids eat free. We've always had great service but tonight we had BRIANA and she rocked it! Any item that we would pick off the menu she, would offer her suggestions and we ended up purchasing more than usual which is great bcause we got to try new things. We upgraded our drinks because of her, got a triple queso dip because of her suggestion (we didn't know about this!), it was nice that she new so much about everything to make these suggestions. She was very nice and personable and brought us out a vegan cake for my wife's birthday. I mean, we knew we'd be back from prior experiences here but we hope we get Briana again!"}
{"text":"We've been here for the bar but this was our first time eating here. Our server Kirsten was bomb AF! She had great suggestion and knew what she was talking about. If you find yourself here ask for her  :) 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Visiting from LA and found this restaurant on yelp and decided to try it! Our server Brittany was awesome and super friendly. We also checked in and got free margaritas! Winning. The food was amazing and the drinks were just right. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Never even made it long enough to eat. The service here is ridiculous. We waited in line and were skipped over multiple times. Finally we said something and they told us to have a seat at the bar...we sit at the bar with two bartenders in front of us, not even acknowledging us. Three young guys come in a few minutes behind us and a third bartender runs over saying \"I want to take this group.\" Again, at this point we hadn't even been acknowledged and they were sitting next to us. We waited for her to finish taking their order, thinking we were next....nope. We had enough and walked out. You seriously need to train your staff on customer service or hire genuinely nice people who don't stereotype. By the way, we were both servers and always leave huge tips."}
{"text":"Best fillet mignon steak nachos!!! The margaritas aren't bad either!! We try to come each time we visit Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Greeted and seated right away.  Several tables seated after us were served before us, one even got their meals before we ordered. Our server Briana was average, barely saw her, my partner offered a refill I was not.  Didn't check back on us or the meal. I has chicken fajitas which were bland, everything needed seasoning, rice was nice. Johan had Cali burrito, had a few pieces of filet mignon poking out top, but that was it, mainly filled with fries.  Corn chips and salsa were good."}
{"text":"Man this was an Amazing place but really great views.    It sure beats Hooters any day"}
{"text":"I'll start that food is good, however ordering over the phone is a nightmare. Not only I've spent over 20 minutes placing an order, but also trying to explain the to person over the phone how many tacos comes with order. isn't that basic knowledge when you work in a restaurant to know menu items? Or is it too much to ask for?! We ordered vegan chicken tacos, and separate vegan taco so it will make a total of 3 vegan tacos. Person on the phone told me that order comes with 1 taco, which isn't true, because I have ordered them before and I know that there are 2 of them (mind you, it was the same person taking my order every time over the phone and still didn't memorize menu items, very poor training). Then ordered cheese enchiladas plate and guacamole & salsa with chips. And guess what happened? - we got one vegan chicken taco plate order (which already comes with 2 tacos) and two separate vegan chicken tacos, 4 in total. What supposed to be cheese enchiladas, all of them with chicken, meat and pork, none with cheese, I never even mentioned that we wanted beef and/or any meat enchiladas. And no salsa! Working in the reservations department in hotel, I can make room/spa/dinner reservation under 10 mins while providing 5 star service, and I do memorize all of the room categories/spas services and menu items (which are there over 18 Restaurants on the property), and it's not really necessary to memorize all of the menu items, it's more than enough the to know where to look and which button to click to build an order, which employees of the this Nacho Daddy is lacking very much. And it's not their fault, it's purely poor training and managing."}
{"text":"Salt and sauce. That's what I remember.  Food is not good when there is too much salt and sauce.  This place is a chilis wanna be. Trying to be hip but it just did not work.  Service was just ok too. The location is horrible.  Off strip. You gotta wanna go here and I don't wanna come back."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy saved the day by having vegan options on the Las Vegas strip! Their vegan nacho plate did not disappoint. I had to call my server back to our table to make sure they were actually vegan because they tasted so \"real\"  My nachos came with nacho cheese sauce made in house, black beans, guacamole, jalapeño, pico de gallo, some kind of green sauce that was delicious, a red salsa and vegan sour cream. My service was great and the restaurant was very clean. I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Everything was good but did not like the lobster nachos but the took it off our bill so that was nice"}
{"text":"Great place for nachos and margaritas. Not very busy. No wait time when we visited. Nachos were priced from $12-23. Good atmosphere. Visited on a Friday around noon. Good topping to chip ratio. Ended up with a little extra toppings. Fun to share family style."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy Is Bomb Place to Eat at All The Employees are Super Cool! Bomb Food!  The Waitress \"Samm\" was Super Bomb She knows how to do it Right 5 BIG STARS FOR HER!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this place after he found it on Yelp. It's a little difficult to find since it's behind the miracle mile shops. Once we entered we were in for a treat! We decided to sit at the bar since it was football Sunday. We were greeted right away by the bartender. Toop notch service. Every bartender, food runner and barback always stopped to make sure you were taken care of. I got the hot buffalo nachos and my husband got the filet mignon nachos, both were excellent! I will definitely return here my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"The place was very busy and I was IMPRESSED wd hardly waited more that 12 minutes. The service and staff were a.azing! 2 had the VEGAN Fajita bowl and it was fresh and so delicious. My husband had the VEGAN Burrito  and could not put it down. Everything was neat and clean...we WILL come again."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the vegan nachos but the staff were very nice and the margarita was pretty good."}
{"text":"So we wanted to try this place because of their Vegan options. We went on a Friday afternoon. Food was amazing, service was amazing (wish I got the waiters name). Everything was great so we decided we would come back on Meatless Monday. If you order a vegan dinner you get a free beer plus kids eat free. We were pretty excited to go back. When we got their our waiter wasn't as friendly as the last one but that's okay. So we ordered. I really enjoyed my avocado tacos and Michelada. My husband asked about their beer special and the waiters reply was \"nope\" my husband was a little confused so he pointed out the board with the advertisement of the $2 beer again the waiter was a little rude with his reply of \"yup we put that there to get rid of it and we did\" so anyways fast forward to the bill. Apparently if your children are vegan they don't eat free! I mean the meal was free but they charged extra for the vegan chicken for both kids and extra for the black beans (which we didn't ask for) if given the option we would have said no beans because my daughter doesn't like black beans. They ended up fixing the check for us but we are hesitant about going back. I guess it's worth a try like I said Friday was much better than Monday."}
{"text":"Zachary is the best! The ingredients are fresh. Cooks are amazing and made the best corn on the cob!! The bartender is the most awesome!!!! Come here asap! Trust me I know a good place when I taste and see it :)"}
{"text":"Service is wonderful Judy was very on top of things and informative, the food was great portions look small but are very filling so be careful how much you order or there will be left overs. All portions are easily shareable and the manager stopped to visit everyone is very friendly and cost is low.  Definitely a return date day local for us."}
{"text":"Came here on my second night in vegas and got paired up with a great server named DJ very attentive and helpful, great energy! Also the portion size for the boneless wings were awesome for just 11-12$. Highly recommend the company and the food !"}
{"text":"Enjoying Nacho Daddy in Las Vegas. Having a great time and love my dear friends we are  with."}
{"text":"Walking into Nacho Daddy, we were looking for a quick bite to eat. We got a lot more than that - great food and great service.   We got here a little after noon and was quickly seated inside. As the hour progressed, more and more people came. Yelp has a free margarita for a check-in so that was the first thing we were on the mission for. Jovanny was our waiter and he just exuded warmth and hospitality (I might be biased because he called me exotic looking ;) He brought us out our margaritas right after taking our orders. I'm not a huge fan of margaritas but this was good! Plus, it came in a cute mason jar which was nice.   Jovanny came by with some chips and salsa on the house (this guy is such a sweetheart!). Our food came by pretty quickly. I got the dry chicken wings with BBQ sauce and my fiancé got the supreme tostada nachos with vegan chick'n. I LOVED my wings - they were crispy and I got to dip it in as much sauce as I wanted. My fiancé devoured the nachos but the few bites I was able to get, it was so good! For people who like spicy, that is a great option!   Bottom line, this is a great place to grab a bite and a drink. Make sure to ask for Jovanny :)"}
{"text":"This was the Best Mexican Grill in Las Vegas!!!!!!!! The Dining atmosphere was laid back. The music was on point. The food was delicious and fast! The Host and Waiter was pleasant and awesome! When I come back to Vegas. This my first spot to go to for good eats!"}
{"text":"The nachos are good, but skimping on the things that make them great (tons of cheese and toppings). Overall, not a great experience - could probably have cheaper nachos just as good with 5$ and a microwave."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place and nachos are my life so we went in with really high expectations, so maybe that's why my dinner was so meh.  I ordered the Daddy's Margarita and that was awesome!!!! Also good? The bottomless chips and salsa. Everything was pretty blah from there.  I got the Tostada nacho appetizer for dinner. The seasoning on the meat was like...they tried to do Mexican flavors but got confused or were missing the right spices and used something else. It was just weird. And I totally appreciate super loaded nachos... these were just too much.   My husband got the buffalo chicken nachos and got approximately 3 tiny pieces of buffalo chicken on them.   Thank god for the bottomless chips and salsa or we probably would've gone hungry.   Our server was great and had an awesome sense of humor, so that helped. I'm glad we went and tried it out, but I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"I moved here from San Diego, so naturally I was skeptical of any Mexican food not twenty minutes from the border. But I was happily surprised with most of it. Nacho daddy does exactly what they advertise: nachos. I wouldnt get much else, if anything, off the menu but nachos and drinks. Be careful during sporting events or happy hour, they can be a bit crazed and ticket times can run long, but all in all good time isn't your severs fault, and they are trying as hard as they can. I love bringing guests from out of town here for the happy hour margs and some good ol chicken nachos!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Good food but the service made the difference.  Ryan - you rock!!! We will. Keep coming back for you my man!  Thank you for being so professional  And genuine.  Great server."}
{"text":"It's hard to mess up nachos but somehow a restaurant whose only job is nachos has managed to do so. We ordered the 4-Cheese Nachos with jalapeños as an appetizer. It was disgusting! The cheese was not melted all the way, there was entirely WAY too much cheese! (I know, I know, too much cheese?!) The four cheeses they chose did not compliment each other. The very little chips on the plate were soggy. Do not order! We also ordered their chicken and steak fajitas. They were just ok... beans tasted out of the can and rice tasted like some Uncle Ben's crap. There are times when horrible food can be overlooked because the service was spectacular but that wasn't the case here either. My suggestion is to skip this place and make your own nachos at home... I'm sure they'll taste better."}
{"text":"To whom this may concern:  *Fellow Vegan friends, beware of the lack of menu knowledge from Nacho Daddy's staff members*  Literally at loss for words. Yesterday My vegan friends and I went to Nacho Daddy for lunch, not only because they had great yelp reviews but also because of the accommodating Separate vegan menu they offered. Between the 3 of us we ordered, the Vegan avocado tacos, The vegan chicken bowl and A VEGAN CHIMICHANGA! As the chimichanga was served to the table my friend had cut the end piece to find out that the \"Vegan chicken\" was shredded. To our surprise we all had never seen \"Shredded vegan chicken meat\" so to be on the \"safe side\" we politely called our waitress over to ask her about the inside of our chimichanga, she reassured us that the meat WAS VEGAN and that it was house-made and delivered from a outside commissary daily. Because of the reassurance WE ATE THE ENTIRE BURRITO! In fact, We were so impressed by our faux meat vegan burrito that we anticipated ordering some again later that evening. As I ordered 3 vegan chimichangas to go expecting the same burrito I had ordered earlier.. I come to find out it was completely different. It had black beans, corn and rice... and NO shredded vegan chicken...hmmmm...I called in to verify if there may had been a possible miscommunication, but when I talked to the manager Edward (who also claimed to also be vegan) he told me that the burrito with the shredded chicken WAS NOT VEGAN. I repeat, NOT VEGAN!!! I even checked the receipt from earlier that day and it said \"V.chimichanga.\" So either it was the kitchens mistake or she grabbed the wrong burrito. Regardless, WE asked her... she saw us eat it.. and she reassured us!! Edward apologized and said that he would replace the burritos but honestly, I am just completely disgusted. Eating meat goes against everything I believe in. It goes against my personal faith and beliefs. I can cry right now because I feel cheated. I spent $100 on a lunch, to be swindled into eating a burrito filled with dead carcass. I no longer have faith in Nacho Daddy. My friends and I never ever step foot into this establishment again!"}
{"text":"I always jeered at the prospect of going to a restaurant that specialized in nachos.  I would hear stories of my friend who would praise Nacho Daddy on his side of town for hours on end.  I was so close to going the one Downtown, however I was recalled home prematurely by my significant other.  This time.  This time, it was DESTINY!   My friends and I counted the days to opening when we first saw it was coming to our side of town.  The the time came.  We sat, we ate, we got full.  We left happy.  This place was awesome.  Great ambiance.  Awesome Servers.  Insane menu!  The prices may be a tiny bit higher than what we usually spend, but totally worth it.  I got the \"Fiesta Chicken Nachos\" with my now infamous custom order of Diet Cherry Coke.    Both were spot on.  The Nachos were very tastey.  When they came, I didn't know how to attack it.  I accidently got a  little bit of cheese on my finger and when sucked my finger clean, it hit me!  My first bite of Nacho Daddys.  It was epic.  The Fiesta Chicken Nachos was very creamy, very rich (but not too rich) and there was definitely enough for me to take it home if I was sensible that day.  But I wasn't.  I DESTROYED the plate and it was glorious!  I swear up and down that it tasted like I was hitting pockets of CHOCOLATE in my nachos.  As crazy as that sounds and as gross as the prospect may be, it was good!  Our server was astute and prompt.  For being open for only a few days when we visited, the place was well put together and on the ball.    I highly recommend this place.  - Clean - Spacious - Music Videos playing, Sports playing, TVs everywhere."}
{"text":"Not impressed with Wednesday night trivia here. The music is playing too loud in background, servers are polishing silverware and singing happy birthday, making it hard to hear the questions. Server, Shawn, was intrusive, telling us answers to questions. Did we invite you to be on our team, shawn? No. Not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"I wish you guys could expand to the Bay Area like San Francisco! Out of our two nights in Vegas we had to go here twice! It was that good and I will definitely be coming back and be recommending the place. The servers here know how to do their job. They are very chill people and gave the best service I've had in a while. Would give them more stars if i could!"}
{"text":"I came here (Sahara location) with my boyfriend because I heard the best things about this place. When we went it took about 15 minutes to get seated. No, it wasn't busy at all. We were seated right by the kitchen (horrible idea), where we had a pretty good view of inside the kitchen. (The food was sub par. Nothing special. But that's not the reason I wouldn't come back. The service was HORRIBLE. The manager couldn't have been there that night. Plates were being broken in the kitchen. The staff was laughing. A male server picked up a female server and just horse playing the whole time we were there. They got our order wrong and took forever to give us back the check. We felt that if we just left, no one would have even noticed. It was like the staff were at a frat party. I'd never go back there, it was awful."}
{"text":"This place has a lot going for it. Who wouldn't want to eat dinner at a place called nacho daddy? That's the first thing that pulled me in. We made reservations for 5:30 on a Tuesday night which was probably pretty wise. If you check in on yelp you can get yourself 1 free house margarita which didn't slack on the tequila. My boss and friend both ordered off the nacho menu. I went with the Baja seafood combo. The combo was 1 crab/lobster enchilada and 1 fish taco. The taco shell was by far my favorite. It was homemade and super flakey unlike any other taco shell I have ever had. The fish on the taco was also such a nice size. The rice wasn't dry and that's super important! Overall, I was very pleased with this dish and would recommend it to anyone that doesn't want nachos. My friend is a nacho queen and she raved about these nachos. They come piled high and like they say on the menu not a chip is dry. That's how nachos should be. I loved nacho daddy and think everyone needs to make a visit here."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place! Don't be afraid to order the beer battered lobster tacos. They are amazing! Happened to be a mis-order to my benefit!  Don't mistake me, the service was excellent. I also had the lobster and crab nachos which were divine. I suggest ordering a side of sour cream and guacamole with it. Margaritas were top notch, just like I'm used to in Texas. The atmosphere was also great with old school rock music videos playing. Since it's slightly off the strip, the prices are very reasonable compared to the quality. I will be back tomorrow for happy hour for sure. Great hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Great vegan nachos. I ate them all up they were so good. Check in for a free house margarita. They also play really cool music from the 80s and play the videos on their tv screens. Saw videos I'd never seen before of songs I love."}
{"text":"I first tried it at Life is Beautiful music festival back in September and I tried to go again to their location in Downtown the same weekend but it was way too crowded! I came back and once I found out there was a location on the strip, I knew I had to go again!   We ordered the Naked Grilled Wings with BBQ sauce with ranch to start off with appetizers. Beware: their portions are pretty filling! If I knew this, I would've not ordered an appetizer! I ordered the Fiesta Nacho which is big enough to feed 2 people (I shared with my brother!); it consisted of chicken breast, salsa, onions, beans, cheese, green/red chips + tortilla chips, queso fresco, pico de gallo, guac and sour cream! SO GOOD. These nachos are life changing and I can't look at nachos the same way again.   My dad ordered a burrito as it was his favorite type of food and he loved it! My mom ordered the tamale-enchilada entrée combination and she LOVED it. Nacho Daddy gives such a great amount of chicken breast meat and the portion size is definitely filling. I love how the tamale is open faced which is a different twist on how tamales are usually made!   The service was okay. They ran out of items we wanted to originally try. They ran out of the Daddy's Wings which is why we ended up ordering the Naked Grilled Wings (which was not a disappointment at all!) On top of that, they ran out of deep fried ice cream & ended up getting the Caramel Apple Nacho (which was not disappointing at all either). Overall, we ordered items we originally didn't plan to but still loved it!!  Nacho Daddy is going to become must-have when I go to Las Vegas! I can't wait to come back especially because I didn't get the chance to check in on Yelp for a free Margarita~"}
{"text":"Wow! I am pleasantly surprised, I was advised to come here because they had a vegan menu so we decided to check it out.   1. Johnny was our server and he was legitimately one of the most pleasant, professional, on top of it waiter I have had in a long time. Our service was awesome, and he deserves a lot of recognition.   2. The vegan menu had so much variety and we tried 3 things that contained \"chicken\" and let me say this \"chicken\" my boyfriend and I had to inspect because it tasted SO REAL. It was DELICIOUS.   3. Fast, in and out! My boyfriend and I timed it and we were in and out within 40 minutes. With an appetizer, and 2 entrees and in no rush. The food came that quick!  Awesome experience, and definitely one of my favorite places. Going to be coming here a lot more often."}
{"text":"Amazing food and a great place to bring people when they come and visit. The customer service from Kayla is always amazing. We always try to get her as our waitress when we are here. Her smile and help with drinks and food cannot surpass!!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't any better than other nachos I've had, and it also cost more. They ripped us off on the pitchers. Pitchers were 35 and the single serve size was 10. The pitcher poured like 2 drinks maybe... so if you want average nachos and ripoff drinks, then I guess it's fine. There's simply better places to go, but most of Las Vegas is designed to rip you off. I mean, it's the gambling capitol of the world, so I guess by Vegas standards this place deserves the 4 stars or so it has, but otherwise it's a 2. Would be 3 if the prices were more reasonable. Then a 4 if the food was actually better than average."}
{"text":"Displeasure to eat here, take it from a local. So many better options on the strip."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Came to watch a Chargers game however instead of being straight up with us from the beginning that they were having a satellite issue, they insisted the game would be on in time for us to watch, had us put in our order, then when game time started, still gave us excuses..... Still no game.... We won't be returning to watch any games here."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Nachos are huge. Quality for price is great! Ate here for brunch and only needed nachos to fill up!!! Greats 80s videos."}
{"text":"Veggie omelette was great, good mix of sautéed veggies & everything was seasoned well. I really enjoyed the hash browns and my family shared the churro pancake, which everyone loved. Service was good, not great, but we did have a larger party so we have to cut my man some slack. Door is kept open, which is nice, but also lets birds in. All in all the family was happy we found this place. Would go again...oh & prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, attentive staff, and amazing food! Menu has options for just about everyone.  I typically don't drink but tasted the spicy cucumber margarita and it was AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Gabby & Gio were awesome and so friendly with our group.  They provided fast, friendly and impeccable service!!  It was my first time here and Food was great but the service was even better!!  I definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Vegan nachos, do I need to say more. Lots of options for vegetarian and vegans as well as meat lovers. There was about a half hour wait when we went. We decided to sit at the bar and received great service! You will leave satisfied and full!"}
{"text":"My wife and I walked in and asked to be seated at the bar. We sat down, 10 minutes passed and no service. The bartender and fellow coworkers were hanging out at the end of the bar.  The bartender walked pass us twice with no acknowledgement.  I wish I would have taken a picture of them huddled at the end of the bar but I didnt even think about it.  If anyone from management sees this,, please check your cameras from January 21st 11:20pm-11:35pm. I had on a camo hat and red flannel shirt, my wife had on a white jacket. Unbelievable lack of service."}
{"text":"We were in from Chicago and stopped for a drink. It was happy hour where they have great drink and food deals. Very comfortable atmosphere. Fun place to sit and watch a game but it doesn't have too much sports bar feel. Gabe the bartender was very professional and accommodating. Loved the place so much we brought a party of 14 there tonight for dinner. Everything was again great! Food excellent!! Definitely recommend it for locals or vacationers."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast, very cool vibe- right off the strip, around the corner from Planet Hollywood. Would come back here for lunch, service was great! Nice big menu. Love the name!"}
{"text":"Not impressed...service was incredibly slow, everything is overpriced and the food was just Ok...no reason to ever go back."}
{"text":"The music was Poppin, the food was delicious & the drinks were amazing. We went on a Wednesday night & I was jammin so I can't wait to see what's going on Friday and Saturday nights!"}
{"text":"Good food, service was fast. I had the shrimp nachos and my bf had steak tacos.  We chose to sit at the bar and the atmosphere was great. We went around 11am and we sat there for awhile just talking to each other and the staff no rush."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming here and our server, Kiersten, was super helpful. She recommended I try the spicy cucumber margarita which sounded really strange to me but I ended up loving it. I also got the Thai nachos which were also a little spicy but delicious. My boyfriend got regular nachos but I think the Thai were a lot better. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place is weak. It's like a gimmick. Taking your money just because you like nachos. Nothing special here. Taco Bell has more flavor."}
{"text":"Great spot to visit as a vegan. Enjoyed their spicy burrito, skinny vegan cheese dip, some guacamole and a free house margarita with the yelp check in. Definitely recommend it whether you're a vegan or just someone who loves Mexican food."}
{"text":"More like yes daddy! Love the burritos ! And such great vibes ! Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Jessi and Zack's team work is great! Awesome customer service! These people need raises! Food is also fantastic with large portions."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, place was pretty busy. Checked in with Yelp and got free unlimited chips and salsa. Otherwise it's $2.99. They should just include it, like most Mexican restaurants. Anyways, the salsa was ok, a little bland, I had to add some salt for flavor. We got the mild and medium salsa, pretty much neither were spicy, which was ok by me. I ordered the cheeseburger nachos as my main. Once again, they were a little bland. The ground beef did not have too much flavor. I would say they were just ok. My brother ordered the spicy shrimp nachos, he said they were not spicy at all. I tasted them, kinda bland. All in all the food needs more flavor here. We shared a fried ice cream for dessert and that was pretty good, but I think it was like $9, glad we didn't get two at that price. Oh yeah and when you eat the salsa here, prepare for your breath to smell like garlic for the whole 24 hours after, even with mouthwash and good brushing, lol."}
{"text":"Food is really good. I've had pretty much all of the nachos on the menu (huge nacho fan) and I haven't been disappointed. The staff is hit or miss. There have been times people will sit down 10 minutes after we do, and get their food a good 10 - 15 minutes before ours. (Yes, I've waitressed, I know it can be that some food is made more quickly. However. This has happened multiple times, one of which the other table ordered the same thing we did.)  If you request alterations (add sour cream, no beans, whatever) make sure you repeat it a few times. The food is good when it's right, but often is rushed and not made how you've asked. All around, I'll definitely be back, but dining in has been a bit frustrating."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have come to this location several times and each time their service gets worse. A couple days ago we came to get dinner, got seated in a little corner where the server didn't even notice us for 15 minutes and then after we ordered it took them 2 HOURS to get our food to us. We kept asking other servers to check up on our food and no one was giving a straight answer and our own server was flirting with the group next to us. We were about to walk out but one of the managers noticed we weren't getting our food and it decided to come out right that second. When we asked our server he claimed a big party was there and they put in their order right before ours, but we knew that was a bs excuse because several people that had been seated after us had gotten their food and left as well. There were no big parties either. The food didn't taste as good as it normally did either. The server told us he was going to take care of the bill but only gave us $5 off. Probably won't be coming here again.. terrible customer service."}
{"text":"This place was just OK to me.  We sat at the bar and the bartenders seemed to forget about us often and messed up our order for something as simple as chips and salsa.  It was super crowed, as many places along the strip are.  Our drinks were OK, but very large (as one expects in downtown LV).   I'm not sure I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Great food, went twice while I was in town.  The customer service is spot on, super friendly, and willing to make you feel comfortable.  I definitely recommend this for folks wanting bar food and drinks on the strip."}
{"text":"Hands down the best experience. Came here just for the scorpion shots. It was Saturday night , 9pm, you get the picture.  What better to do before the club then have some nachos and shots. Our server was amazing. I wish I could remember his name but he's been working there for a while. Rocker style and has had over 100 scorpions while working here. I did my free margarita for checking in through yelp and my the margaritas are good here. Decided to do a whole round for everything. The nachos were off the hook. Lobster was my favorite. Fajitas and wings were good as well. Our server even took a video for us and was so informative. He even held our shot glasses for us until tomorrow morning. I do recall before leaving I let his manager know about his extraordinary service. I've been recommending this place to all my friends. Seeing this place on yelp, it didn't really appeal to me but I was so glad I came!!!!  Can't wait till my next vegas trip"}
{"text":"Food was great, Margaritas were even better and the waiter was very nice and accommodating. I recommend ordering the nachos with French fries instead, A-mazing!"}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars.  I came to Nacho Daddy on a wednesday for trivia, which begins at 7pm.  My first impression was that this place looked more like a sports bar than your typical Mexican restaurant, with TV's, a craft beer bar, and a large bar area.  The trivia was surprisingly fair and winnable, and there were about 8 teams so it came down to the wire.  The beer selection was very solid, at price points of about ($6-$8).  They also implemented a new craft beer bar where they put local or rarer rotating craft taps on the wall (about 6) and you buy a card and pour yourself some beer on your own.  I absolutely love this concept because I usually get flights to try new varieties.  It did not say what they charge per oz, but I would assume it would come out to about $7 for 12oz.  The person I came with had the burger, which he said was pretty good.  And the fajitas smelled amazing when they passed by.  I have also heard stellar reviews about their margaritas and their scorpion shots (not sure this location does though, however).  Finally, I had a coupon which they honored no problem.  This place is worth a try, especially on a wednesday since there's good trivia.  But I could even be back here to watch some sports in the future because the atmosphere and beer selection is quite nice for a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere!! There's a vegan menu and the supervisor Jovany was the sweetest!!  Great service and nicely decorated. :))) very happy we came here!"}
{"text":"Well I don't even know where to start......and that is saying something about me.....LOL. This was hot spot # 3 on my VEGAN Excursion and have to say this establishment has been the BEST YET it is absolutely FABULOUS!!!! Shawn our server was a joy and even the hostess's were awesome. I HIGHLY recommend the VEGAN CHICKEN NACHOS......and the VEGAN Chicken Tacos.....all of it was SUPREMELY DELICIOUS. The Vegan Chicken Tacos are made with a HOMEMADE Flour Tortilla which is the best I have EVER had. They were so good in fact we bought 2 of the tortilla's themselves to GO. We are going to take some Vegan Cheese and make quesadillas with those delicious tortillas.....yummy!!!!   We will absolutely be returning to try a few more items on the VEGAN menu and experience the Happy Hour. I encourage you all to RUN not Walk to this location for some of the best VEGAN food in the Valley here. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Their nachos are amazing! No matter which ones you get, you can't go wrong, they come loaded. Also, if you want a real challenge, the scorpion shot is the way to to. A shot of tequila with a real scorpion to go with it.  Also, when you go, ask for Aly as your server. Excellent service from start to end and very friendly! Followed up after our food had come out to make sure everything was good and was always on top of it when it came to checking up on us."}
{"text":"Do not go here. The meals are so salty, you won't be able to eat your food. They advertise as the best margarita in las vegas however it is sub-par.  Just your average tasting margarita and extremely salty food that has no flavor other than salt. The service was mediocre hence the two stars."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere but slow service.....bartenders are super slow and forgot our appetizer......"}
{"text":"First time here, had the unlimited chips & salsa, loved the hot salsa. I also had the pork soft shell tacos. I wasn't a fan but the rice was very good. Had the grilled corn as an appetizer, that was delicious. Next time I visit Vegas I'll skip the unlimited chips and salsa and just go for one of their specialty nachos which is what I wanted to try anyway. Also, we did get our free Margarita thru Yelp and it was delicious, nice & strong."}
{"text":"If you love nachos, then this is your jam! They have so many options that it's dizzying, but once you've selected a dish you won't be disappointed. The drinks could be more inventive, but this is the perfect night spot for drinking buddies who need a snack!"}
{"text":"Leaving our hotel, we saw Nacho Daddy, and my wife wanted to try it. I thought, really? a whole place for Nachos?   Well I was wrong.  It was great. As soon as you walk in you are greeted by a custom Scorpion Tank, made by the fellas from the TV show Tank'ed.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  I ordered the Thai Chicken Nachos. so good. perfect flavor. The cheese was just enough. The Thai  flavor was on point and it was more than enough. Loved it.   My wife got some sort of seafood Nacho. It had lobster and crab I believe. it looked awesome and  there was more than enough.  we both had margaritas which were good and strong. my only regret is not doing the Scorpion shot. There server Alyssa was great."}
{"text":"Kimberly pointed me to the pork taco and enchiladas. Fantastic choice!! Buffalo nacho mini hot the spot as well."}
{"text":"VEGAN deliciousness!!  Ordered the jackfruit tacos w/guacamole and chicken nachos.  The food portions are massive and unfortunately the vegan chocolate cake was sold out but everything is so good! Definitely not the last time and we will be back"}
{"text":"Good food at reasonable prices! I recommend this as a nice spot a little off the beaten path for a very interesting menu with Tex-mex."}
{"text":"Great vegan options in a city that doesn't always have them. Service is super friendly. I came back 2 nights in a row!"}
{"text":"Our first time eating here!  The food was delicious and the wait staff (Lee) was excellent!  Quick and friendly service.  Will DEFINITELY be back!!"}
{"text":"Great price and a lot of food for the money.  Service was very bad, and they tried to sit us right in the sun, they need sun shades on the second floor above the entrance.  When we asked to move our seats, they had this attitude as if we were putting them out.  There were plenty of other tables they could have sat us at."}
{"text":"This restaurant had a very good variety of vegan choices! They have vegan cheese and vegan sour cream. The vegan chicken was some of the best I have ever tasted. My husband and I examined the tofu strips very closely because it was hard to believe that we weren't eating real chicken. My \"chicken\" fajita salad was one of the best I have ever had. Plus they had fab margaritas as well!!! I will come here every time I come to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Casandra was our waitress at the bar and she was great. She was sweet and helpful. Did a great job explaining the menu. Would come back!"}
{"text":"Yum! Food came out fast. Got the Enchilada nachos with red sauce and they were great! Used the yelp app and got a free house margarita. Will be back again next time I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Good vibes. Huck was an attentive waiter and the House margs are huge and the potion sizes are good for anyone. 2/3 of us left with food to go."}
{"text":"I like how this place is not divey and had a great selection of drinks and food. Large screen tvs all over, perfect place to munch before the night begins."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy. Love their enchilada nachos. Their is a good amount of nachos for the price. I def can't eat it all to myself I like to share."}
{"text":"Stop in again tonight to our favorite local watering hole, Sweet Olivia served up as usual our favorite El Primo Margaritas for a little Valentine Day CAP. Nacho Daddy never disappoints and always sends us home happy!!!"}
{"text":"Food comes in huge quantities but needs some spice to it. If you're sitting at the bar, find Lauren. She's awesome!"}
{"text":"Nacho daddy is a must try! Ryan particularly was amazing! He was so attentive to everything. I would definitely be back because of him"}
{"text":"Beware!! There is a Scorpion right at the entrance waiting to greet you! Ah, don't be scared! He is in a glass box but yes, at the entrance. Loved the ambiance of the restaurant, very rustic! There are huge screens where they play video songs which was very cool.  Got seated in a couple of minutes and we unlocked a couple of House Margaritas with Yelp check-ins and the drinks were good. Also tried Daddy's Margarita which was very good. Ordered Vegan Spicy Burrito and Thai Chicken Bowl. Both the dishes were really good but the latter in particular was very different from the ones I have ever eaten in Thai restaurants. Had a subtle sweetness from the sweet chili sauce in the dish. Absolutely delicious! The food was quite filling leaving no room for dessert.  Rating the following out of 5:  AMBIANCE - 5 Amazing rustic charm!  FOOD- 4 House Margarita - 4 Daddy's Margarita - 5 Vegan Spicy Burrito - 4 Thai Chicken Bowl - 5  CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4  WAIT TIME - 4 It was a weekday and we went in pretty late in the night. Not much of wait time.  HYGIENE - 4  PARKING - Not sure about the parking. We walked down from our hotel. Parking in Vegas, especially the strip is a bit cumbersome so it is better to take Uber/Lyft."}
{"text":"I recently visited this strip location and I was pleasantly surprised by the food and most importantly the service! It was very busy when we arrived and our server handled it like a professional. Arieanna was so upbeat and helpful with everything, she knew the menu inside and out and gave us great recommendations! She did what most servers miss and that was making a genuine connection with us while giving flawless service. This will be a restaurant we will visit frequently and we'll be asking to sit in her section every time!"}
{"text":"We just moved to LV and saw this place as we're driving along Sahara. The exterior is not at all fancy but don't let that deter you. The staff was so pleasant and welcoming. Starting with the host, Adrianna, who greeted us with a big smile and put us in the \"VIP\" table as she smiles. Our server was Alex and again welcomed us with a smile. The experience was exceptional and that's just the staff and service. The food... oh my... excellent as well. We had the sizzling shrimp tacos, grilled fish tacos, and steak tacos. Clean and great flavors. Don't forget to get the freshly made chips. We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Super cool atmosphere and the most incredible Burritos, Chimichangas and stacks of Nachos you'll ever have. You can split every entree...especially the Burritos and Chimichangas, they are HUGE! Love the Blood Orange Margarita. Check in with Yelp and you get a free house margarita or the cost of the house margarita applied to any other margarita of your choice. Well worth the visit!!!"}
{"text":"Never again. If you're known for nachos, your nachos should at least be good. I'd give this place zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Great Food , and Great Drinks - Margaritas,micheladas,scorpion shots , Delicious food"}
{"text":"Good food and great service from MICHAEL!! Will definitely eat here again. Try the nachos and cheese quesadilla with chicken. Both are delicious. Daddy's margarita ... yum!!"}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy was REALLY good. I visited here twice on my 4 day LV trip. I wish there was a location in NY. The first time is really what blew us away. We got the nacho average nachos to start and we each got chicken enchiladas. The food was amazing-the best nachos I've ever had. The chicken enchiladas were really good as well. I got the yelp free margarita with a flavor for a bit extra and he got the margarita with the corona on top. We both loved our drinks. The service, food, and drinks were excellent!  We came a second time for happy hour. We got the bbq chicken nachos, which were tasty but not half as good as the nacho average. We also got Bangkok chicken tacos and the chimichangas. The chimichangas were my fav. Happy hour drinks were also very good.   Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Love this place excellent vegan menu.. Our waitress was the best.. Solid margaritas and a bunch of great options for kids too."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy - at least the one I went to - is, from all outside appearances, a typical suburban strip mall restaurant. But - for me at least - what sets it apart is the extensive and well-prepared vegan menu offerings.   First off, as a transplant from the East, I liked their beer selection, and enjoyed the Dogfish Head on draft!    For an app, we started with the kale salad. It's very good, as it includes lots of different vegetables, but the kale itself needs to be  - well, not cooked, but rubbed or marinated - just sayin'.  This is a common issue with restaurants trying to include kale on their menu - it's a great vegetable but in most cases needs to be \"softened\"/broken down rather than just offered chopped raw like lettuce.   I shared two vegan fajitas entrees with my partner: Chick'n fajitas and \"flaming beef\" fajitas (a special)   - and both were not only delicious but very generously portioned! We couldn't finish our food! I love that vegan sour cream, vegan cheese etc are all part of the menu.  As per the standard of regular Mexican restaurants, you have your choice of corn or flour tortillas, and all the additional fillings besides the \"chicken\" and \"beef\" are provided - rice, beans, etc. Delicious and satisfying.   There are many, many other vegan dishes - nachos, burritos, etc etc that we simply haven't had a chance to try yet.   I will be back! Wish this chain could spread out to other states besides Nevada.  This is a great model of a conventional restaurant seamlessly offering delicious, satisfying plant-based dishes so that \"mixed\" groups of diners can all be happy."}
{"text":"My husband and I just wondered by and decided to have lunch here. Best Nachos I have ever had. The host is a sweetheart I had an outside drink and she saved it in the cooler for me for when I was done anywhere else they would just make you toss it away. Waitress was nice and recommended one order of nachos for both me and my husband since we weren't very hungry and yes they are big nacho servings. We got the chicken fiesta nachos which I think the chicken is tinga style flavor it's so good. Can't wait to visit Vegas again just to have me some nachos!"}
{"text":"GEO is AMAZING!!!  Excellent food, impeccable service. Great night & Brian is the best!! Arieanna we LOVE her!!!"}
{"text":"Great service from Morgan! Amazing food! We had the supreme nachos, chicken fajitas, potato nachos, apple nachos and churro sundae! All were made perfectly and huge portions! Highly recommend this Summerlin location!"}
{"text":"We were staying in the area... Walked to get take out.. Worse Worse experience. The young gal at the front...Rude. I asked if i could place an order to go... was told be with me in a minute... She proceeded to help the customer on the phone that called after I spoke with her- for a to go order- before mine... then sat 4 people... after 15 minutes asked if i would like to order. I had ordered from another wait staff... very nice.... but then waited 45 minutes to get my food. maybe 20-30 people in the place at 1:15 pm on a sunday so not busy. Wont go back to that place... but the food was good."}
{"text":"Judy was great!  We got the filet mignon nacho to share and it was really filling and delicious!  Perfect if you love guac but don't like spicy food."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Fast, friendly service. Food was great. Decent sized portions and very affordable. Great atmosphere and very clean. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The only place I will go to for amazing margaritas, Davor makes the best!! Plus the food is great! My personal favorite is the street tacos!"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, my new boss came into town to meet with me. For dinner, she wanted a margarita and I had remembered my coworker telling me how much she  liked Nacho Daddy. Perfect time to try this place out and get my new boss a little liquored up.  So let's just say, I think I got three emails from my boss telling me how much she really  liked this place. And I agree.  As an appetizer, we ordered the nachos with filet mignon and why not since it's on the company's dime. It was really flavorful, so so good.  I made the mistake of ordering the Daddy signature fish tacos. The fish was bigger than the tortilla! It was only two tacos but I could only finish one.   My boss ordered the Daddy signature chicken tacos. It was a little too spicy for her that she could only finish the one.   I'm looking forward to going back and trying the other nachos and a flight of tequilas."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews for Nacho Daddy's seem to run between like and hate, no ambiguity. I went there tonight with the sweety, and we really enjoyed ourselves. We like the building, plenty of room. We liked the service, Cason, our server was nothing short of excellent. The nachos were Prime. I ordered the enchilada nachos and was very satisfied with the choice, they were tasty indeed. My sweety ordered the Thai Nachos and she was Ecstatic!  She absolutely loved them . We agree, we will definitely be going back. Why 5 stars on the first visit?  The nachos were THAT good. Our server was helpful, kept our iced tea full, and altogether delightful to talk to. Nacho Daddy's has a very good tequila selection, and beer selection, as well. The menu is extensive, not just nachos but tacos, burritos,  bowls, salads, sandwiches, appetizers, and desserts. The prices seem fair.  Did I mention we really liked this place? Yep. We'll be back, to sample the tequilas, and eat more nachos."}
{"text":"This place is awesome they have a vegan menu that is outstanding! If this place were in Phoenix I would eat here once a week! The vegan chik'n tacos are hella delicious! They have a great happy hour from 3-6 with vegan street tacos and drinks starting at $3. This location has ample parking and and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Aside from the fact that the food took 10 light years to come out, and was made incorrectly !!!! I'm one out of 4 tables here ... it's slow as fuck 2:35pm in the afternoon. well actually less than 10 tables here and they're still taking forever to bring out our food. Hostess was very cute and friendly but other than that total buzz kill..."}
{"text":"Was told I didn't know how to order.  Umm excuse me you don't know what specials you have and the prices that they are so duh I'll have a question or two.  Have never been treated so rudely"}
{"text":"I absolutely have to give this place five stars, no doubt about it.  Prior to EDC, I made a post on reddit asking for recommendations on late-night eats, based on where I was staying. A number of people recommended this place because it was directly across from where I was staying (Marriott Grand Chateau).  Other than EDC, I planned my trip around eating. My flight was supposed to get in around close to midnight, which means I'd have sufficient time to drop off my bags and go to Tacos El Gordo, but unfortunately, my flight got delayed!!! So by the time I got to my hotel, it was too late :'( luckily, Nacho Daddy was still an option and we walked across the street for some nomsss.   That night, we ordered the triple dip appetizer and the filet mignon nacho to share between the five of us. It was enough for me to get full and for the others' midnight snack. THE QUESO IS SO BOMBBB. no idea what kind of cheese it is but I highly recommend it. The filet mignon nachos on the other hand, literally cannot go wrong. We inhaled it.  So anyway, this place was so good...that we came here Saturday morning with our party of 9, of course, no shame. We ordered the triple dip appetizer and three orders of nachos: filet mignon, lobster and crab, supreme tostada. Again, I think the filet mignon was the favorite of the three.   Our servers were generally attentive, but I think the most important part of dining during EDC weekend is keeping us fed, so they did their jobs. I'm definitely coming back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Came out looking for a place to eat here since we we watching s show here at the mall. Went solely off reviews. Ordered ceviche for myself and kids nachos and kids quesadilla. Ceviche was tasty and very fresh. Only thing is I think there's to many chips for the serving. Picture to follow. Kids nachos were big portion we added chicken to them which was very good. Quesadilla was not very tasty. Needs to have less cheese and more crisp tortilla. It taste more like oil. Our server Gio was friendly and upbeat! Made good conversation and took care of us. Overall it's a good place to eat as a family. Lots of tvs and we got the Sunday night game after asking the GM! When we asked a server passing by he came back saying the owner wanted to watch the hockey game. So when he came by asking what could he do to make our expierence better we asked for the Sunday night game which he said ok to. We thought it was wired when we got the first response. Glad they decided to put it on."}
{"text":"\"Jeo\" Jovanny and Brian gave great service! Drove past this place and the name caught my eye. Came back the following day after walking through the Miracle Mile. Jovanny helped me choose my nachos. So many great options! I chose the Filet Mignon nachos which were delicious! The food and ambience here is great! Large screen tv and lots of other tvs playing good music videos. Nachos and drinks were perfect. The staff here are so welcoming as well! Manager Brian was very personable and our waiter Jovanny had us laughing and eating good! Will definitely return. It's just outside the Miracle Mile. Maybe I will be brave next time and get a scorpion shot!  Tip- try not to over fill up on salsa and chips before your nachos! But try the salsa for sure! There were 3 bowls, mild, medium, and hot!"}
{"text":"Food is tasty, guacamole is good restaurant is clean the only thing that I would highly recommend is tell them NO ONIONS! They put so much onion on everything and in everything."}
{"text":"Not only they provide excellent food but our server made the difference. Her name is Tuesday and she is very nice and attentive to all our needs specially to my daughter."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere! Great food with vegan options."}
{"text":"Enchilada nachos are tasty.  Mango Margarita was very good,  music was good too. Some people complained about their server and we witnessed several tables complain to our server about one guy in particular,  but ours was great and picked up the slack for the other dude"}
{"text":"Two of my friends and I came here late tonight to grab a bite to eat. This was the best decision ever!!! First, they have a vegan and vegetarian menu (I am vegetarian) and it was delish!!  My carnivore friends had a hamburger and the smothered burrito. The chicken in the burrito reportedly was very tasty and it was the best burrito she's ever had. The hamburger and fries were both really good!! We topped it off with the Carmel Apple Nacho which was sooooo good!!! Hazel, our server, was excellent and the manager, Edward, made the visit extra special! Thanks for making our trip to Vegas even more memorable!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Really enjoyed the ambiance and food. I highly recommend getting one of nacho dishes. Service was average."}
{"text":"This place is BOMb! Like who woulda thunk it?!? I expected nothing but then the most delicious foods came out! Amazing enormous nachos, great tortilla soup, yummy salsa, burritos, everything! Order garlic fries, they aren't on the menu but they'll make them and bloooow your mind!"}
{"text":"Nachos were bomb and the free drinks were a plus! Plus our waitress looked like Mariah Carey"}
{"text":"A great escape from the high prices up and down the strip!  The nacho plates here are out of this world and for under $20 bucks 2 people can eat like a King!  They have great mixed drinks and shots with scorpions in them!"}
{"text":"Nocho Daddy is a fun place and convenient with the strip right there and the Miracle Mile mall. The service great but it is a bit loud. The food is really good and the portions are pretty large in size. There are scorpio s living in a tank by the hostess stand and apparently available for a drink."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I went in here excited to have the nachos what a mistake that was! Everything started out fine the bartender/ waitress (?) came over and took our drink orders. I decided on one of the most popular nachos they sell, she took the order promptly. And that's when the place went downhill FAST. It took probably an hour to get our nachos. And when we got them they were missing 3 ingredients: yellow queso, fried jalapenos, pico de gallo. After telling the guy who ran us the food, he straight up told us \"I didn't think you wanted that on there.\" Which was so confusing because I DID NOT SAY THAT. The only thing we wanted was to substitute ground beef for chicken. How could that have possibly meant that we didn't want three items on the already bland nachos? Then he argued with my girlfriend about how the cheese on it was the yellow queso. In the description it clearly had a comma separating \"cheese blend\" and \"yellow queso\" when she pointed that out he said \"Oh I guess you're right.\" He took the nachos back... After waiting an HOUR to get the first nachos I can't tell you how surprised I was that the \"correct\" nachos came out not even two minutes later. I wish I was exaggerating, but they really came out in under two minutes. The next nachos we got were a joke. Nachos did not taste good, bland, basically just chips with guacamole. Still missing the fried jalapenos, and a new item the green avocado salsa. We weren't the only ones with issues the table directly next to us had a WAY worse experience, if that's even possible. Would not recommend this place, you would be WAY better off not wasting your money."}
{"text":"Went to Vegas for my husband's work conference and didn't want to wait 30 minutes to eat brunch at another restaurant. Saw Nacho Daddy on Yelp and decided to come here instead. I was pleasantly surprised that everything was flavorful. To be honest, I thought it would be another \"Chevy's\" type of restaurant but I was so  wrong.  My husband ordered the Surf & Turf Taco Combo and I ordered the Baja Seafood Combo.  From the Spanish rice to the refried beans, everything was delicious.  I wanted to try my husband's food but he ate it all up before I could take a bite!  Even the free margarita with Yelp check-in was yummy!  Our waitress was super nice too! Left very satisfied!"}
{"text":"I came here last night with my coworkers because they wanted me to take the famed scorpion shot. I chose my shot with Jameson instead of the standard tequila. You get to take the shot glass home as a souvenir. I don't know if you're supposed to swallow or chew the scorpion, so I chewed. It's like eating something very dry.   There's a lot of TV screens around and seating so I can see it as a popular place for sports.   Shout out to our bartender Booker? for serving us last night!"}
{"text":"Whew! Another Vegas afternoon recovering decided to come check this place out. The hostess Dominique was awesome. She made sure where she was going to seat us was going to be mist comfortable for my husband in a wheelchair. She sat us nit too long after checking in.  Once we were seated we ordered our drinks and food. As we were sitting there it seemed a little long if a wait for our food but no sooner we mentioned it there it was.   I ordered the chicken fajitas which came out nice and hot and had tons of onions and peppers. My husband ordered the filet mignon nachos. When my food came out it didn't come with the plate that had the sides and the tortillas, so I had to wait for the server to come back.   Over all the food was great, hostess was awesome server had a few flaws. It was nice that management waived my meal since I didn't get everything timely. I would def come back here when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Wow! Had low expectations and they were by far exceeded! The food here is so great I had it for lunch and came back for dinner  Thai chicken bowl with wild rice is out of this world good. All the nachos looked amazing . Service was ok, but didn't mind bc the food was fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"We came in after hiking for a few hours.  Never been to a nacho daddy before and I loved my first experience here.   The service was friendly. We had a baby and a vegan with us and there were no problems at all.   My nachos were incredible never had anything like them before . Huge portion, huge flavor. I loved it.  Plus we got free shots because the Golden Knights were playing and scoring! For every score free shot.  Awesome experience would recommend."}
{"text":"Great experience at Nacho Daddy! I did the scorpion shot. The Herradura was was smooth. Our server Ryan was super on point. He had the best suggestions with the filet mignon nachos and the quesadilla. I would totally come back here and see Ryan again."}
{"text":"Food was great!  I had queso and fish tacos!  Desi, the bartender, was slammed when I arrived and was super apologetic when she was able to take a breath!!  Will definitely be back!  Desi is awesome!  Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Had the best time! First stop on our Vegas trip! Jovany and serena were amazing.. great customer service and margs for days."}
{"text":"Awesome nachos and the awards they have received for there margaritas are absolutely earned!!!! Devon and all the staff were super! There unique poor your own beers are top quality and very well priced per ounce  The atmosphere is very cool and not too loud!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible may as well eat there vegan options because the meat portions are laughable spent 40 plus dollars on a plate of chips and beans a steak sandwich with less steak than subway and recieved horrible service even though we were one of 4 tables I  the entire Restaurant"}
{"text":"We have tried Nacho Daddy a couple different times. It's just fine if one is in the mood for something a bit creative and not a food critic. The prices are fair and their menu is not so \"off the wall\" it leaves one expecting more and getting less. Because, actually, the nachos are \"less\" dressed than a demanding palate might hope for. Have fun, have a few chips and be nice. The place is nice enough and and the whole idea of Nacho Daddy is to have fun over a plate of this or that."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service from the host to the bartenders to the whole thing I would stay farrrrrr away from this place far far farrrrrrr away"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim! Daddy's mule Was awesome and so was their beer called who's ya daddy. The enchilladas and tacos we delish! Hidden downtown gem."}
{"text":"Jovanny!   Jovanny's stellar reputation is well deserved. After a  couple of frustrating days (in which we had our car broken into and were burgled), we were in desperate need of some positive vibes. Meeting Jovanny was easily one of the best things about this (very eventful) trip. From his excellent customer service to his bubbly, warm personality, we were thrilled to have him as our server. He was very sympathetic to our plight and made our dining experience extra special to ensure we left feeling better about our time in Vegas.   The margaritas, nachos, and chips and salsa were all fantastic. I would rate Nacho Daddy a four or five based on that alone, but the service we experienced with Jov was second to none (and I'm serious - best ever). The staff who brought out our food were super polite and friendly as well. I only wish we could leave 10 stars.  Thank you for helping to salvage our vacation!"}
{"text":"Nice enough people and decent food. Nothing special once they get your order out to you correctly, but OK for a late night bite I suppose. To each their own, but this place was not for me. The margaritas were good, but everything else was mediocre including the service, food and other drinks."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time at this location and it was by far one of the best places on the strip to eat and drink at.  One of the bartenders Arnold Was one of the most down to earth bartenders I have encountered. I go to a lot of bars and interact with a lot o bartenders.  He made us feel right at home with his down to earth attitude.  I ordered the naked grilled wings, the best wings I've had.  I would definitely recommend this place. We will be back soon.   Thanks Arnold."}
{"text":"Great place around the corner from the Elara. Best nachos I've had in a long time. Service was great and server was awesome. His name was Michael. Great work team. Thanks for making a late night snack worth it"}
{"text":"Oh my godddddd You have to eat at this here restaurant. We had lobster nachos the bombbbbbb"}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious! Fresh French pressed coffee started it off and then had the traditional huevos rancheros with the eggs over easy, Hubby had the breakfast burrito and didn't finish (it was HUGE). Got the churro pancake too! mmmmmmm. Highly recommend this spot!! I will be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Perfect late night food for hungry Vegas dwellers. The staff was friendly and the beer was cold!"}
{"text":"Larkyn was a fantastic waitress. Great food. We will be back!!!  We drive by this place all the time and finally stopped in. So glad we did."}
{"text":"Vegan options galore!  We shared the queso, kale salad, and spicy burrito. Everything was great. The dressing on the kale salad was amazing and that was one of the best burritos I've ever had. Good margaritas. Loved it. Can't wait to go back!  Staff was good."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Great food and sports are on everywhere! The service can be spotty, but the food helps you forget about that"}
{"text":"Not good at all, stay away. The nachos are nachsogood. The margarita wasn't good either."}
{"text":"You know, it wasn't bad. It wasn't great. It was busy, but it wasn't packed. Service could have been wonky. But our Server was a CHAMP and made the whole experience AWESOME!  Not to say the food was bad, it was just Meh... But the confusing part was, 2 burritos, 1 nacho plate and 2 beers and it was like $100. That seemed kinda high. And although it seemed kinda high, we still had a GREAT time! Most people won't let Management know about great service, however on our way out, I made sure I let the MOD know what a great Server we had and what a great time we had because of him!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here for lunch and we absolutely loved it!! We ordered the nachos (filet mignon.. did I spell that correctly?) and we devoured them. I had the house margarita (which I got for free when I checked in). The service was great and the atmosphere was cool!  When I'm in Vegas I will make sure I come back here for my nacho and margarita fix. You can't go wrong at this place.."}
{"text":"Love this place! Mostly always order the filet mignon steak nachos. It's really a LOT OF FOOD!!! I always order pick up and it's ready the minute I pull up. Only thing about this location that's annoying is the parking. Other than that I could eat here everyday!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place to come have a chill and relax dinner came here on a Sunday before we headed out to California. Good service and food. I had the chicken enchiladas and we also tried the chilaquiles both red sauce which were good both came with rice and beans."}
{"text":"By far the best food and price we've had so far. Way better value than even the food courts in the casinos and on the strip. I had BBQ chicken nachos. My husband had buffalo chicken nachos. We shared the free margarita from Yelp. All was delicious, portion size was huge. Wait staff very nice, and not at all busy on a Monday just before noon. Did not see any scorpions in the tank."}
{"text":"The host at the entrance did not have great people skills but once we were seated, the waitress was amazing. The food was excellent. We started with the chip trio which was a white cheese dip with jalapeños, salsa, & tasty guac! My husband and I shared the steak and shrimp fajitas which were so tasty also. I wanted to try the nachos since that's what drew me there but after the appetizer of chips, wanted something different. So good!"}
{"text":"The bbq chicken nachos were great and the service was even better. I will definitely make sure to go back next time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place had amazing service. My server Arianna was amazing had very good hospitality. Gave great recommendations"}
{"text":"We were so excited when we decided to dine here but ended up being disappointed by this generic  nacho shop. The ambiance was fun and upbeat but it didn't hide the fact that the flavors were one dimensional and lacked soul. We got the filet nachos hoping it would be packed with juicy bites. While the steak was cooked well, the rest of the ingredients were very blah."}
{"text":"Dollabill was amazing. We didn't have very much food, street tacos and chips and salsa. Great salsa for salsa lovers!   We will come back to see dollabill!"}
{"text":"This place was great right from the start when we walked in they greeted us  friendly took us to the table that we wanted, our server was amazing it was so much food we couldn't eat it all and everything tasted great"}
{"text":"Food tastes great but service was lackluster and ULTRA slow. Cristina has been absent from our table for 30 minutes :-("}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Guacamole was in point and queso amazing. We had the pork burrito and the standard nachos. Serving was amazing and very attentive. Hidden gem!!!!"}
{"text":"Looks like a very nice place. Love the scorpion shot!! Would love to come here next time with a bunch of friends. This spot is perfect for a group of friends to come after work (like I did), drink scorpions lol, eat the best nachos in town and just hangout. This was my first experience here and will DEFINITELY be returning!! I forgot to post pictures of the nachos I got, but TRUST ME, they were with excellent!!"}
{"text":"Went their for the first time via recommendation from a friend. Taco Tuesday and BOGO on tequila. Not to mention that arienna was absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"I've only been to Nacho Daddy once and it was fantastic! I ordered the filet mignon carne asada nachos and a raspberry margarita. The nachos were delicious. The chips are nice and thin and fresh, the cheese was melted, not a cheese sauce, and there was just a little bit of heat.  I also liked the smokey flavor that I think came from the meat.  These nachos are easily big enough to share.  The margarita was amazing. It didn't taste like a margarita from a gross bar. It tasted fresh and fruity and the flavors were balanced.   I also had the flan, which was great. It was a little firmer than I am used to, but really great.   I sat at the bar and enjoyed the videos from my high school days and the friendly service from Tyson (Tyler?) and the other bartender, who was fantastic."}
{"text":"Had very good margaritas and sizzling shrimp at bar, signature tacos really good,  great service, drinks and food."}
{"text":"This is pretty much my daughter's favorite restaurant. I like it a lot too, and it doesn't help that we live close by, so everyday she recommends going and I seriously consider it. Whenever family and friends come to visit, we bring them to Nacho Daddy. Our favorite servers are Keysen and Jasmine.  They used to have daily specials. They did away with those. I don't know why and I think they should bring them back.  They changed the chicken on the Chicken Fajita Nachos. I liked the grilled chicken better.  The ingredients are fresh which make for some pretty delicious dishes. The margaritas are fantastic! Dammit, now I want nachos and margaritas. One thing to watch out for: Over-charging. The prices listed on the menu are OFTEN less than what rings up on their computer."}
{"text":"Love the margarita and Filet Mignon Nachos!! Our server, DJ, was awesome...haven't been to Vegas in a decade and glad I came here on my return!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to meet here for drinks after work.  We didn't plan on making the happy hour cut off time but since I was seated at about 7 minutes until 6 p.m. I figured we could score a couple items off the happy hour menu.  A server didn't appear until right at 6 p.m.  I mentioned had she arrived five minutes earlier I would have ordered off the happy hour menu.  To her credit she did allow us that courtesy.  She was also nice enough to inform us the happy hour nachos consisted of nine chips so that was a hard pass.  We ordered the sliders, chimichangas and drinks.  Absolutely no complaints about the food.  Service as the night wore on became another issue.   Once our original server left we saw our new server one time.  Other than that we literally had to flag down a server or walk to the bar ourselves to get assistance.  But during this time you could see servers on the floor just chatting with each other.    Even though it was March Madness and St. Patrick's Day neither the bar or restaurant was at full capacity or anywhere near it, which if it had been I might have tolerated the crappy service to some degree.  This was also my first time sitting in the bar area versus the restaurant where I've always experienced good service so maybe that is also a factor."}
{"text":"Best chicken-less fajitas ever!!! They make their own vegan  cheese,  and sour cream... OH GOD SOOO GOOD!!    UPDATE **** You can't go wrong with Vegan Chick*n fajitas and NACHOS  from here!!! I visit this restaurant every time I go to Vegas, I really wish you guys had a location in Riverside, CA"}
{"text":"Absolute worst service. The management blamed it on being short staffed, but it was so slow."}
{"text":"So what do you do when you wake up first thing in the morning after a late night with a hangover? You go and get something fatty. At least, that's what I would do. I wasn't hungover when I came here, but I bet this place would hit the spot after a wild night out. We ordered the Fiesta Nachos and the kitchen staff at Nacho Daddy did it right. The nachos were mixed with both rich (cheese, refried beans, guacamole, and sour cream) and savory ingredients (pico de gallo, sauteed onions, salsa, and chicken). The pico de gallo actually fooled me into believing I was being a little healthy. LOL.   Service was okay. It was early when we went and I don't think they were all that attentive, but we were fine with it. There's no rush when you're in Vegas anyway."}
{"text":"We ordered the queso dip with meat and it was gone within seconds .. My son had the shrimp fajitas and he barely had room to finish them .. I had the street tacos , they were ok, maybe a bit more cilantro / onion mix would've been nice but they were filling .. Our server Jasmine was super, she was very friendly and prompt ., I'm sure we'll be retuning soon.."}
{"text":"Great place.  This one is a bit more polished that the one in downtown but it still has the same great food.  Great non-casino food!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! We had spicy shrimp nachos, white peach margaritas & the churro ice cream  (we had the Cesar salad, too, but that was nothing to write home about). Mikey was an excellent server!"}
{"text":"Second time in tonight jovany took great care care of us we had an amazing experience Rolando was also our server and did a great job we are from Palm Springs and we will be back just for jovany great service awesome atmosphere"}
{"text":"Loved the tacos with avocados....house margarita was refreshing.....great ambiance and service by Michael, our server."}
{"text":"I had been craving Nachos the entire weekend we were in Las Vegas - of course when we walked by here we made a mental note to stop by before we left to satisfy the Nacho Craving. For the prices they charge - you would expect a mountain of nachos. NOPE. At $15-$20 for a plate of nachos - that are smaller portions than the $8 nachos at Dave & Busters and Buffalo Wild Wings - it was quite a disappointment. They have a lot of \"specialty\" nachos - which is great for the variety - but the prices are ridiculous. The waitress, when we asked about portion size, told us we could probably all three share 1 nacho order and be fine and full. We were so hopeful! We still ordered 3 plates of different nachos - no one left full - we all left hungry with no food left. Ridiculous. Go somewhere else for nachos. This was a waste of money."}
{"text":"Great option for a late night craving if you want something substantial but on a decent budget. The ambiance is nice--it's rather dark inside but not overly so, and the tank of scorpions at the entrance was definitely eye-catching. The menu is pretty large, as are the actual nacho dishes themselves. I am not sure if they are all the same size, but we went with the Supreme Tostada Nachos and they were definitely enough for two people. Even though there wasn't a lot of food per se, there were enough calories in all the cheese and saucy goodness to last for a long while. All in all the dish was balanced and done very well, with the chips remaining crispy while we ate and flavorful salsa and ground meat distributed all around. They did screw up on the Daddy's Wings though; while the meat was perfectly done, the sauce on the outside was way too salty and made the wings pretty hard to eat. Maybe just a fluke? Remember to check in for that margarita."}
{"text":"The nachos are great. Large portions that are perfect for sharing. The staff is also very nice and attentive. We went in a Friday and were seated promptly and had great service. The prices were reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Esta fue una cena increíble. la tostada suprema era increíble y sí sin gluten. Mi hijo amaba a sus nachos. La comida para crear una estrella de seis. El terrario está muy bien desde derrumbó también! Nuestro servidor de Serena era también increíble. Nuestras bebidas nunca estaban vacíos."}
{"text":"Recently the service has become really bad servers are clueless, in the last month twice we have got the wrong plate.  Last time it was a pickup order and when we got home the wrong plate.  Watch out with the assistant manager James, he promises that he is going to honor the mistake the next time you come...but guess what they DIDN'T"}
{"text":"Kimberly was an awesome bartender!!! Food is the best. I'm vegan and having this available on the strip is amazing."}
{"text":"Went on yelp to find a place to eat came across nacho daddy never been there.  When you walk in they have a tank with scorpions it pretty cool to see.  We sat down look at the menu and got a order of filet mignon, it was good!  Bartenders there are great when we sat at the bar.  Booker T or daddy nacho he wanted to be called . He Made me and my GF a Jameson margarita it was BOMB!  You have to try it.  Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Great service very attentive, food was good but not as much to rave about. It was okay to try once but probably won't go again."}
{"text":"We had the lobster and crab nachos and it did not disappoint! It was a little spicy but soooo good!! We also had the Cadillac and their famous margarita and they were both good, huge cup!"}
{"text":"Last week, my boyfriend and I visited Las Vegas. As a vegan, I wanted try out the chick'n fajitas.   Apparently, when I ordered, the server didn't hear me say \"vegan,\" and when our food was brought out, I thought my chick'n looked a little odd until my boyfriend tried it and told me that it was definitely real chicken.   At the time, our server wasn't around, however one of the bartenders nearby approached our table and she handled it very well.   She was very empathetic and she quickly replaced my meal with what I actually ordered. She also asked me if I would like a courtesy drink. I wish I got her name. Thank you for making my visit so much better. :)"}
{"text":"My sister and I are here, each having ordered the supreme tostada nachos.  OMG, they sucked!   The smallest mom & pop Mexican drive thrus have better food at half the price.  Nacho cheese sauce?  Really?  Too bad I don't drink, because if I was drunk, I might have given another star.  Really disappointed."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy is good.... I ate at the one on Freemont Street, and this place is just or better. Great staff and very clean , they took over the old Fire Fly location. It's a cool little bar/sports place.  I just came here on Sunday to watch the game and eat, I ordered the big daddy burrito... im sad it wasn't worth the money, it was the size of a del taco burrito for the price it's not worth it, it should be on the appetizer menu.. im sad and still hungry.... today was a waste of money...  always order the nachos they are worth the money. ....."}
{"text":"Big portions of greasy food.  Good for groups getting drunk.  There is way better Mexican food around."}
{"text":"Was a pleasant surprise coming here.  Saw this on yelp and took the dive to see if worth the visit.  We both loved it! The nacho's were spot on outstanding.  We had the chicken version, excellent taste profile.  Also enjoyed the shredded chicken tacos.  The margarita was good, can't enjoy a meal like this without this beverage...lol.  Our service was outstanding and attentive! Next time we are back in Vegas we will stop by again!"}
{"text":"*update*  I was part of a 7 person party where my friend (the birthday girl) already left a complaint [below] so I won't go into all the details. But with working in the food industry myself I felt I needed to say my opinion. This was the worst experience I've had at a restaurant by far. Now I did order the Bottomless Margaritas while waiting a long time for a table. I have to say that the drinks and the bartenders were amazing and this is why the restaurant gets a 2 star rating. Without them I would have said 1 or picked 0 if it was an option. Our waitress was overly rude, didn't know the menu, inconsiderate and unapologetic after everything else that happend. 3 out of 7 meals were wrong, a different one had a hair in it and with all this the she still couldn't find the decency to fill our glasses even through she passed us like 10 times and it was not even busy.  James the manager worked with us to fix any issues and stayed to talk to us and you can tell he was sincerely apologetic. I will never come here again to eat but since the bartenders were so awesome I might just show up for some more bottomless margaritas but that still won't be anytime soon.  I had left this review on Facebook top and the manager replied that he would reach out to me regarding the issue and he never did."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and service is usually average. But I love the V selection, so I come back. today Aimee was just awful, one of the worst servers I've ever had. Just bad all the way around"}
{"text":"This place is one of the funnest, tastiest restaurants in Vegas. The margaritas are poured strong and everything on the menu is good. I recommend the guacamole for appetizers. The breakfast is served all day long so try a breakfast burrito with a Daddy's margarita. Such a good combo!"}
{"text":"My 4th night in town and I was looking for something off the beaten path, less expensive, and just fun. This place fit the bill and more. The waiter, Ryan guided us through the margarita choices and nachos with real insight and knowledge. The price is half what I would have spent a block away on the strip and the food and drinks were great. A must visit for that casual fun night."}
{"text":"Pros: Amazing service, bent over backwards to make sure we were taken care of  Negatives: Food was pretty average and the two chip orders lacked in topping amount.   If you're going to specialize in nachos don't leave half the stack bare"}
{"text":"I've been here twice & both times were just OK experiences.  The servers are nice & food selection is pretty wide, but their food doesn't appeal to me so much. I've tried their nachos, fajitas, & burritos, and I wasn't a huge fan. Food wasn't horrible, but it's just not my cup of tea.  Nonetheless, the atmosphere was pretty chill & casual, and it's good for any group size."}
{"text":"Great place with quality food. And our server Jovany took care of us. Complimentary margaritas and shots. Going to come back real soon awesome place"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of the Chilis restaurant chain, then Nacho Daddy will be a familiar concept. They serve a Combination of American and Mexican food dishes, with emphasis placed on their unique selection of nacho dishes.  I tried them for the first time today and I probably should have stuck to the nachos the namesake suggests. I ended up getting the grilled cheese sandwich (stuffed with roasted Anaheim chilis, two cheeses, and applewood smoked bacon), because it sounded different and awesome. It was good, but nothing to celebrate, or probably even order again. The bread was a little too buttery tasting and there wasn't as much cheese as I'd expect from a grilled cheese. Bacon was good, but thin. I've gotta applaud the creativity, though.. This sandwich had so many things I like cramped into one package.  My wife went with a sandwich as well and got the cheese steak. It was actually quite small, and I didn't see any cheese on it at all. The beef was flavorful, but the bread also had that weird buttery taste. I like butter, but I'm pretty sure this was some kind of soybean oil based imitation.   Overall, both sandwiches were good, and the sweet potato and garlic Parmesan fries we ordered were great.  I think next time I'll definitely be trying out their nachos, however, because the pictures and descriptions looked really good, and the food I did have just wasn't good enough to bring me back on its own.  We liked the bottomless chips and salsa. Chips were excellent but the salsas were average. Medium was pretty good, but the hot salsa made me laugh. It was just the same medium salsa with a handful of pickled jalapeños sprinkled on top.  The beer selection was pretty stellar, so if I'm ever looking for a place with great brews and appetizers, this is definitely a top choice on my list!"}
{"text":"Best nachos ever! Get them with chicken, it is seasoned perfect. One order is enough for two people."}
{"text":"Brian is the best server ever! Positive attitude and all around funny!! We walked in one night craving some food! He suggested some things and we ordered everything he suggested and BOY he wasn't wrong!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE JACOB AND ARNOLD AND BOOKER. They rocked the nachos and the alcohol all night long. Give them a raise!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Alex is why I come to Nacho Daddy. He is very funny and a great server. I enjoy his company. And....hes good looking ladies....thanks Alex again for a great time."}
{"text":"They have a nice selection of vegan options. We had the vegan nachos. We were very satisfied with the meal. The staff was friendly. It is located off of Las Vegas Blvd and Harmon. Next to the miracle mile shops."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and by checking in I get a free margarita? Seems like a good deal to me so typing enough letters to the it posted. Come by Greta vegan choices"}
{"text":"JOVANY was amazeballs tonight...manager on duty taking our orders and was super friendly. Loved his sense of humor and how fast he got our orders. Naked and hot scorpions!! Glad we stopped in!! #gotstung"}
{"text":"I wanted a late night spot to check out after a show, Nacho Daddy was it! They're open 24 hours, great food, and our server Kiel was especially helpful and attentive! Definitely recommend if you want some good around the clock eats :)"}
{"text":"Stood around at front desk to be seated for far to long, especially based on how slow the entire restaurant was. Once we were at the table and placed our orders, the evening got better. Drinks are alright, happy hour prices made it reasonable, food is good but know that you are getting exactly what you order; don't expect anything fancy."}
{"text":"Visited a few days ago, first time in Vegas. Hostess said our waiter PJ would be over shortly, we waited a little over 6 minutes before a gentleman came over commenting he's noticed we've been waiting a while for our waiter, could he get us started on drinks. I was very grateful for his attempt, commenting that we had just discussed leaving due to not getting waited on until he stopped by. We already had our menu so we knew what ones we wanted. Went with two Margaritas and two glasses of water. PJ actually was the one who brought our drinks to us, explaining it was a busy night, trying to make small talk. My boyfriend had counted during our wait, it was less than 17 tables and more than enough staff that at the most he'd have 3 to 4 tables...so, no excuse! Sure, could have been busy at your dinner rush but we came in shortly after 8:00pm, not a full house, we don't need excuses. Took our food order and we waited, and waited. The kind server who took our drink order must have mentioned something to the manager because he walked by saying \"is everything ok now that we have our food?\". That was kind of innaproapate, either stop before this and visit, or know you rectified the situation by speaking with your employee behind the scene. When PJ brought the food he commented that he'd be checking in a lot, giving us all his attention, that we'd probably get sick of him. He was nice, this is probably his first serving job, just relax and it'll be ok! We saw him the traditional one stop before the check.  We've both been in the restaurant industry, boyfriend a chef and I used to be a server, once you find your Niche you're golden...I hope it's soon for him. He just needs confidence, he's got the rest down. Tasty dishes, ok drinks, they seem to have a lot of acid, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Pros: AWESOME vegan options on the menu! Being a vegan in Vegas isn't the easiest thing, so it was awesome that Nacho Daddy had so much to offer. I got the vegan nachos and thought they were pretty darn good, and might be able to fool someone into thinking they weren't vegan! The portion size was huge, too, so I brought some back to the hotel with me in a box. I'm also a fan of the free margarita with yelp check in! The ambiance was pretty relaxed with music videos playing on the screen and blasting over the speakers.   My only con is that these nachos really upset my stomach. I'm not sure if it was too much grease, or artificial ingredients, or what, but the rest of the day I had pretty bad stomach cramps and it kind of put a damper on things. For that reason, I don't think I'll be back, I don't want to risk that happening again. :("}
{"text":"Was craving nachos for my last food in Vegas before traveling and decided to check it out. Really cool environment, loved the old school videoclips playing. Ceviche was ok for a Mexican one, but the nachos really made me sad. Ordered a filet mignon Nacho and couldn't eat so spice it was (not stated on the menu) and I really like spice food so I knew it was TOO much. So much tomato paste (in nachos?? Really? ) that I wasn't able to taste the food itself. I only had the meat and the guacamole which was all I could eat and taste properly. If you want nachos I'd suggest you ordering something else.. it sounds delicious but at least mine wasn't.. I complained about it and they didn't charge me the nachos (fair enough since I barely touched it) and got me free dessert which was THE BEST CHURRO ICE CREAM EVER! Really, so so good!! You have to try it! Super fresh and yummy, it's not too sweet as I thought it'd be.  Overall, we had a good service and was happy i didn't have to pay for the food I didn't eat but I had higher expectations for a place that is specialized in nachos.."}
{"text":"Came here for the Lobster and Crab Nachos and you should too!  Walked in for dinner on a Wednesday evening and it was not busy at all. The hostess sat us a table where a server quickly greeted us. We shared the nachos along with a salad that totally filled us.    Tip: Free House Margarita with Yelp Check-In ;)"}
{"text":"Our server Judy was so kind and informational She made our first time here great cant wait to come back, loved the food it was deelicious !  loved the fiesta nachos.. great food, great service!!"}
{"text":"Best place on the strip! Great customer service and best chicken quesadilla that I ever tried!!! Ate there for breakfast and dinner and enjoyed every bite! The next time I'm in Vegas I will be visiting Nacho Daddy!"}
{"text":"Laekyn was an excellent Server.  Food consistently good. Love flavors and variety of choices.  Needs more variety in GF dessetts.  Maggie as Manage did great follow up. Excellent music in background."}
{"text":"Not great and overpriced. Had the nachos and chicken wings. Chicken wigs were just ok, but no BDubs and the nachos were just ok. You can get better at Famous Daves for half the price."}
{"text":"Sabrina was very welcoming as soon as we walked in the door. Jovanny was great and had amazing customer service.food was on point!  We loved the atmosphere and loved the sports bar feel with mexican food!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical about going to this place. When one opened up near where I work I decided to give it a try.  The food here is fresh for Vegas. It also has flavor. So many places are \"saucers\" because the chefs don't have any talent or creativity. These guys do. I've asked for changes due to an allergy and it still tastes great. Thank you.  The servers seem like they are happy. You can tell a fake smile anywhere. The manager has been over to check on me every time that I've been in. Drinks are refilled, plates are cleared. I am surprised Nacho Daddy! Keep it up."}
{"text":"Went here a few months back for a painting party and it was great. The staff was friendly, food was good and the drinks were fast and made well. Decided to get a bunch of people together to have a great night out and go back to the place where we'd had such a great time previously. HUGE Mistake! There was 10 of us, the place wasn't overly busy. We sat at the bar at first and the guy/girl bartenders were completely disconnected from the guests, so much that the couple next to us, commented by saying this here is a 3x ask bar. First is an attention getter, second is a request and thirds is a re-request. Right there I knew (being in the business) this was not the place I had visited months earlier. But I shrugged it off and thought well maybe the wait staff will be better. Boy was I wrong! We got to our table and Amy came over to take our drink order and see if we wanted some appetizers. We ordered drinks and explained the rest of our party would be arriving soon and that we'd wait. 15 minutes later we got our first drinks. Amy only had 3 tables, ours and 2 other 4 tops. We proceeded to wait for our stragglers, and then decided we'd get a couple appetizers and another round of drinks. Another 15 minutes passed, and asked twice if the drinks were coming we finally got them. So this time, we proceeded to order our food. Between the time we ordered and the food arriving we ordered another round, again 15 minutes later and several asks later, we got our drink and then moments later our food arrived. It was HORRIBLE! the street beef tacos looked like piles of poop on flour torts with a dusting of parmesan cheese across them, the chicken was canned chicken that looked like it was taken out of the can heated and layed in the soft shells. I've had better from a food truck. My wife got 1 taco and a side of beans and rice. Instead of Amy explaining the price she charged us $5.50 for the 1 taco and $3 per side. so my wife's meal was $11.50, getting the a full meal would have been cheaper. We had a few nacho plates that were okay (nothing spectacular), but they were lukewarm. For a place that has NACHO in the name you'd expect that they'd have some of the best if not the best, unfortunately, that isn't the case. So to sum this experience up, this is the last 100+ Nacho Daddy will be getting from us, and unfortunately, none of my friends or family will be coming back until some drastic changes happen to the staff and food."}
{"text":"What an awesome time, great service, fast, friendly, and AMAZING nachos. We had a variety, the fiesta nachos were a party in my mouth, the filet mignon nachos were really bomb, then to top it off, the deep fried ice cream with sweet chips for dessert. Yo. This place is LIT. And the prices are totally reasonable as well. Our server was RYAN. Really tall, like, building tall, like, 19ft tall. Great server, friendly, considerate, and very knowledgeable about the menu. He recommended virtually everything since we had never been there before. His service (as well as the other staff we encountered) was an excellent 10/10. Commin back every time I'm in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"My husband has been wanting to try Nacho Daddy for a very long time but I had been against it. To me, the name just did not sound appealing and I just was not interested in trying this place. However, we were visiting friends and he finally got his way. We were a party of 6 and got seated really quickly on a Saturday night. Our server was ok, she got the job done and was reasonably friendly. I was super convinced that I would hate the food but I actually liked it. I just went the safe route and ordered the chicken quesadilla  and it was really good and filling with lots of chicken and cheese in it. My friends and husband ordered various nacho plates and were all pleased with their meals we also had the enchilada plate and the tortilla soup. Everything was actually really good, definitely not authentic Mexican food but good food and a great place to hang out with friends. I never thought that I would say this- but yes, I would come back to Nacho Daddy."}
{"text":"great name & idea. Poor execution. Drinks were fast food good."}
{"text":"Delish nachos. Known for their scorpion shot, featured on Tanked. Saw they are around $20 each. You keep the shot glass.  We ordered the tostada nachos $18, hold the beef. This was our breakfast, shared between two hungry adults that didn't eat dinner the night before. We ate every chip and felt full towards our last bite. Great restaurant! I would go back."}
{"text":"This weekend I was in vegas and walking down the strip we wanted to grab dinner I search on yelp and I saw this place had great reviews we decided to give it a chance we got seated almost right away yovanny was our server he was awasome there was a free margarita with the yelp check in and yovanny validate it right away for me   It was delicious we order queso dip and chips so delicious we also tried buffalo wings and they were so delicious too we will be back next time we are in town for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Listen, y'all! Nacho daddy is the truth! I definitely didn't expect to be so impressed with nachos and was sure other yelpers were  exaggerating. So, we started with an order of ceviche and it was comparable to my favorite Mexican market ceviche. The margarita was excellent with patron because with the bottom shelf tequila, I tasted too much sweet and sour. Finally, we got the Golden Knights filet mignon nachos. So bomb holy smokes, my mouth is watering right now."}
{"text":"Ask for Hazel as your waitress!! She is take care of you. She's the best. Get the BBQ nachos!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Great free margarita with check in. We didn't have to wait either time we went and the service was excellent. The nachos and their brunch items were some of the better food I had on the trip."}
{"text":"This place is on point!!! Between the giant nacho platter, the enchiladas, the kids burger, and the queso, it was awesome. The staff here all seems to be friendly, and the manager even checked on us, which I haven't seen in quite a while at other places. We live in the north part of town and came down to Summerlin for errands, but this place is worth the drive alone!!"}
{"text":"First time here,  nachos are one of our fave meals.  Had late lunch with my boyfriend and we ordered the following: Ceviche and the Supreme Beef Nacho.  Really liked the cheese blend, seasoning on the ground meat was flavorful, salsa provided had a great amount of heat ... Ceviche was spicy and fresh!  Overall, very good meal and will come back to try other dishes"}
{"text":"Food so good, but the service was horrible. Maybe I'll try another location . Our visit felt like we were not wanted .    Again the food was awesome ."}
{"text":"The filet nachos heck yes good! The husband also had the scorpion shot. Little pricey but worth it, it's Vegas. Also thanks for the margarita with a yelp check in!"}
{"text":"We love coming to the west side location as the service is always exceptional! Today we brought some first timers and we decided to just sit in the bar area. Dolla Bill took good care of us and everyone enjoyed their food and had a great time-we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Lobster and Crab Nacho...spot on delicious.  Prices were decent, the service was great. Modern and casual, a fun place to eat."}
{"text":"Best food and best Margaritas and I'm very picky.  Eat at the bar and have Booker help you.  He is awesome! Will definitely come here every time we come to Vegas.  Also the music was awesome 90s rap music and videos.  Good atmosphere good food."}
{"text":"That really hit the spot.  It was like a mountain of pleasure (the Nachos) for my taste buds.  In addition, it's a fun place to just chill out with all the flat screen TVs with Football, Basketball and other sports.  The servers are friendly."}
{"text":"Lovely ambience . Great food ! Love the vegan options on the menu . Definitely recommend trying the loaded vegan nachos"}
{"text":"Great option for the late night munchies! I was surprised to see their variety from lobster, chicken, Thai flavored and veggie nacho options. I had the filet mignon nachos, which were piled high and great for sharing."}
{"text":"Honestly- don't waste your time. Way overpriced & even the water tastes bad.  I had a veggie burger- the only thing good about it was the onion I had added on . Sodas are $3.50. Really? My brother says the nachos are mediocre (Rubio's nachos are better). My mom was non plussed by the enchiladas! Keep on movin past this one!"}
{"text":"Ok so the nachos were really good. My son and I shared the tostada nachos supreme, and I had the fish tacos. The fish in the fish tacos was tasteless and undercooked, now with that being said I've had some of the best and  freshest fish tacos from around the world. Service was mediocre at best, they messed up my order then the server comes out and tells me that I can't have fish taco without the beans and rice. Overall it was ok and I might try it again.....maybe."}
{"text":"Good fiesta nachos. Enchilada nachos are better, in my opinion, with the green sauce."}
{"text":"We are visiting from San Francisco and Daria helped us get drunk and told us all the best clubs! We're going to come back in today for round two so I hope she's working"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely spectacular. The portions are monstrous, Tyler, our server, was extremely friendly and attentive, and the margaritas are delicious. It's right off of the strip, and on a Sunday afternoon wasn't busy at all. Do yourself a favor and get the dipping trio appetizer. The melted cheese is pure heaven."}
{"text":"Service was awesome, Huck was fantastic. Answered all of our questions and was very helpful. Enchiladas were great and chips, salsa, and queso were delicious!!! Free marg from yelp didn't hurt either!!! It was so good!!!!"}
{"text":"Our waiter, Vince, was amazing. The food was great! Definitely coming back again. The scorpion shots were a delightful treat."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was good.  I was distracted though by the birds flying around inside while I tried to eat.   Happy hour drinks were nice. I had the burger nachos and waxed!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal. If you really like nachos this is the place to go. I like how they have a guaranteed \"every chip is wet\". I sat at the bar in the bartenders were very friendly. They help me very quickly. And my food came out quickly but it was still fresh. The place is kind of hard to find because it's around the corner connected to Planet Hollywood. However, it's right past the Buffalo wild wings on Harmon and Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"Definitely get your monies worth here.  We had 2 orders of nachos for 4 adults and still had left overs.  Great atmosphere and a friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"No wait, quick service and the filet mignon nachos were amazing! Our waiter said if I check in I get a free margarita, if I pay 2 bucks more I get better quality tequila in the drink. Paid the 2 bucks and got a great tasting margarita."}
{"text":"I am absolutely appalled. We were seated and had to wait an upwards of 7 minutes before we were even asked what we wanted to drink. Before we even got our simple waters 2 other tables seated after us had already received their food. During our entire time here we were never once actually greeted by our waiter. I had to get out of my seat to personally approach the assistant manager to ensure our food order had actually been put in because we had been waiting so long. Despite asking the assistant manager the status of my order I still was left clueless until about 10 minutes later when we got our food. I'll admit the food tasted good but the service was terrible. I've never been treated like this in my life. The only thing fast about this service was getting the check because it was brought to us less than 5 minutes after we received our food. I am never going back to this place because it is not just good food that counts. I also should note that the tables surrounding us were checked up on multiple times by different people and we had never been seen by anyone other than the man who brought us the water. After getting the check we waited a long time as well for someone to come pick it up so that we could actually be on our way out. No one even said goodbye to us when we left. I am not quite sure where the disconnect is but I know the workers there saw us sitting at our table not being helped and it is common decency to check on your customers. After this experience the meal really should have been free. I am very disappointed because even after personally speaking to the assistant manager when I got out of my seat to do so the assistant manager never came to check on us and make sure we were doing okay like she did the other tables. It was honestly just as if we were non existent watching the people around us be given service while we only received the waters, nachos, and the check. I do not recommend going here because they clearly pick and choose who they are going to give good service to"}
{"text":"The food is okay at best, but the worst part about my night was the bar tender, Lawrence. Ordered a dogfish IPA and he set a 1/3 full glass in front of me and walked away without explanation. When he came by again he said that tap was empty, that's great, I'd still like a full beer. I said he could top it off with the other IPA and the glass came back 2/3 full and he quickly walked away. He was also giving away free shots of tequila, which the owner might like to know. Unprofessional and rude behavior, won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat love the nachos.  The manager Jovany was great everyone was very helpful. The food was great can't wait to come back and visit them again."}
{"text":"Only had a couple of items here, but enough pleasant surprises that I'll likely return to try the best again, and explore something else...  Margarita (house) was good, just wish it was less expensive (even with the $3 surcharge to \"double it\"--I honestly think the server said $2, but whatever)  Unlimited chips and salsa for $2.95 or whatever, great.  I could eat those all day.  Tortilla soup was a total pass.  Inexpensive but unremarkable, why keep it on the menu???  Atmosphere at 11:30a on a Saturday, great, cause no one was there!  But notwithstanding the hour, atmosphere was good, server and greeter were \"normal\" which I appreciated."}
{"text":"Had a quick meal here before a show.  The service was great, food was good, and drinks were good and fairly priced.  I'd definitely go back again, given the opportunity."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Never had nachos this good in my life. Legit! This place was so good."}
{"text":"The place was not busy but understaffed had to wait 15 minutes for a table then another 10 minutes for the waitresses to take our order prefer the other locations because they have better service then the strip. Also the wait staff is nonexistent  we asked for refills and sides and were never brought either this is my first and last time here at this location."}
{"text":"What an awesome experience all around. This place is new and hip. And the food is delicious. We came here on NASCAR weekend. Tried Friday night and it was 1 1/2 hour wait. Made reservations for Saturday night. Came here with 8ppl. The food is very fresh and everything is made daily. No joke every single person in our group enjoyed their meal. The nachos are by far the house specialty and they do it very well. Chips are bottomless all you can eat. The guacamole was fresh like it was just combined in the kitchen. If you can ask to sit in Ryan's section. He's the hardest working waiter in the joint. Free shot of any liqueur you like as long as it has a scorpion in it. This place has really great food and atmosphere. It's just off the strip so it's super easy to get to. No doubt Nacho Daddy will be a top stop every time we are in town. Oh yeah, full bar."}
{"text":"Surprised at how much we liked this place. Went here on a whim and were so glad we did. The filet mignon nachos are amazing. Do yourself a favor and add the white queso to them. You're welcome. The grilled naked wings are also winners!   We liked this place so much we came back the next day. Probably the most reasonably priced and best tasting place we found on the strip this time around. Must go."}
{"text":"Passed this place several times while staying nearby. Always down for some good Mexican and was surprised to see so many great reviews. Split the nacho and got a single cheese enchilada to share. The nachos were perfectly loaded, we almost didn't have enough chips. Enchilada was tasty. Unlocked the yelp check in deal for a free house margarita and that was kind of syrupy and sour, but it was free so I wasn't too worried about it. Definitely will come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Chances Of Going Back: 2/5 Would Suggest To Others? Yes What I Ordered: American Tacos (Ground Beef): 3/5 Murf's Tip: Check in on Yelp for a free margarita!  (+) - Cool Venue - Friendly Service - You Get A Free Drink!  (-) - The Meat Did Not Taste Fresh - Pretty Pricey  Nacho Daddy is what Yelp says a 3 star place is...\"A-OK\". The venue itself is a cool theme with televisions everywhere. Nacho Daddy is a cool place to catch a Golden Knights game or your favorite out of town team. The staff at Nacho Daddy is friendly and the food comes out fairly quick. The food is where the rating fell off. By no means was the food bad, but it also wasn't what we were hoping for either. The taco meat tasted like it had been sitting in a warming tray for a few hours. I always give places some credit, so judging by past reviews, I am going to guess we went at the wrong time or an off night."}
{"text":"We had the Vegan Nachos loaded and added the vegan chicken. It was very delicious. The service was great and the wait wasn't long."}
{"text":"i highly recomend this place! We had wings and Nachos and it was good"}
{"text":"Got kicked out for not liking Las Vegas. Manager wearing a Dallas Cowboys jersey claimed I was abusing his employees. Booker and several other bartenders were more than accommodating and did an amazing job. I spent well over 100 dollars on drinks. All the while I was never belligerent or disrespectful. I dislike Vegas, but that shouldn't be a limiting factor on my ability to spend money quietly. Nacho daddy seems like a good bar. They merely have a simple minded and below average manager on duty. 2/10 will only go back to support the real team there. Fix your management problem and I will spend far too much at nacho daddy."}
{"text":"This place holds a special place in my heart.  Tipsy Vegas cravings? Nacho Daddy has huge shareable platters of goodness. They're nice and haven't been too busy the couple times we've visited. The Buffalo chicken nachos are out of this world!"}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy has an excellent selection of Mexican food be it tacos, burritos and of course nachos! The Florentine nachos was very good and had a unique spin on the usual salsa and beef based nachos. This is the old Firefly location so they didn't do much changes except to move some tables and chairs around. Food = 4, Decor = 4, Service = 4, Drinks = 4, Overall = 4. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went a few days ago and frankly wasn't impressed.  The nachos were very skimpy on the toppings and on the smaller side for the price.  Service was good though!  I was also surprised that there is a charge for chips and salsa.  This location has been numerous different restaurants over the years and it looks to me like that will continue unfortunately."}
{"text":"Ryan was really great.   She helped us with recommendation and was really personable and friendly.   The food was good and huge portions."}
{"text":"This place has bottomless mimosas and giant, delicious portions of creative nachos? Hello my hangover's new favorite place! We sat at the bar on a Saturday with thankfully no wait. Our bartender was nice and helpful with suggestions, and real fast on the refills on those mimosas. First we ordered the spicy shrimp nachos, and the bartender TOLD us they were spicy, and usually I can handle some spice, but damn, those were spicyyyy. Fiance loved them. So then I ordered the pulled pork nachos, white queso, BBQ sauce, pulled pork, crispy onions, yum! We also ordered an app of the queso. I'm not saying that I ate all of it...but I ate all of it. It's cheese sauce in a skillet in your face!   Bottom line: mimosas and nachos are actually a really good combo."}
{"text":"This is the second trip I have made here. Staff is incredibly polite and all have a great sense of humor. Both nachos and entrees tasted amazing and were filling. Place was clean and had great music playing. Atmosphere is definitely family friendly. Definitely going to come back very soon."}
{"text":"Arieanna is the best waitress I have ever had. She provided excellent service! Great food and drink with awesome service!"}
{"text":"Awesome nachos, great environment. Got us in fast. The bar is open seating. We watched the Knights beat the Capitals and it was awesome. Great people (working there and customers), and we enjoyed Alex."}
{"text":"They have a whole page in the menu of vegan items! Awesome place! Thanks for the great service Jovanny!"}
{"text":"Make sure you ask for DJ! I have been before but I will never have another server if I can help it. The place was packed but he still gave great service. Me and my girl  are picky eaters and he got the food right the first time! Overall had a great night."}
{"text":"Nachos are good but very heavy (literally and appetite wise). I suggest asking for side plates so you can eat them with a fork! My group of 5 came here during lunch and had the 3 different nachos, 1 with filet mignon, chicken enchilada, and cajun seafood. All were delicious but I'd probably eat this for more of a late night meal :)"}
{"text":"Service is superb... But food is not worth it... I went here with family and I ordered the Tamale & Enchilada combo... Meat are dry and the taste is okay but not amazing.. There are other Mexican restaurants out there that are worth it especially for the price... We all work hard for our money and we deserve what we paid for!"}
{"text":"Just ordered the vegan Chik n Nachos through Postmates and received the vegan loaded nachos instead. They're not bad and arrived fast but I really wanted to try the Chik n version!"}
{"text":"Good evening everyone, wow when it comes to vegetarian/vegan food they're second to none. All of their employees are awesome and make sure you're doing good. Moreover, they always have deals on their drinks, if that's what you're into as well. Also if you want to meet a great Bartender then Arnold is your man he's funny, charismatic, and makes sure you leave with a smile."}
{"text":"Looking for a relaxed place for dinner on A beautiful evening in Vegas and came across  Nacho Daddy with 4.5 Yelp stars...so guess where we ended up?  This place is totally legit!  When we arrived, there was a 20-30 minute wait so we went to the bar and ordered a pitcher of \"Daddy's Margarita\" and they were probably the best I've had in any restaurant ever!  We sat on the patio and had the \"Golden Knights\" Nachos, which are the Filet Mignon nacho's with extra spicy peppers and queso...delish!  We also got the ceviche, which was good too. Overall, we had a great dinner and recommend you stop by for some amazing Nachos! #nachodaddy"}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Good margaritas. Great nachos. Came for a quick bite and loved it ."}
{"text":"Nacho average burger nachos were AMAZING. Bacon bits ground beef cheese etc The Whole chabang. I'm from Texas and have eaten some good quality nachos but these are worth the trip. And the chimmichanga egg rolls were great. Amazing happy hour menu for cheap food and the margaritas were decent."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place is so much more than nachos!! They have an enormous 7 page menu with everything from crazy nachos, \"lighter\" menu items, to a sopapilla breakfast, and their happy hour 'aint half bad. They have a self serve draft beer area and 150 different tequilas to select from. I think they would benefit from a late night happy hour menu and/or a live acoustic night. They have the space and atmosphere for it, and there are limited places that offer it in Summerlin (for your 30 something crowd). I'm just sayin'"}
{"text":"I had a great meal here. Between the manager and Judy I was taken good care of. I had the moco loco nachos and they were perfect for after a night of drinking."}
{"text":"The boneless grilled wings were the BOMB!!!!! The check in free margarita was great as well. I did order the Spicy Cucumber Lemon margarita and I couldn't drink it. Initially when I got it I thought it would be a small kick to it but they actually put pick chunks of Serrano peppers/jalapeños in it. It was waaayyy to spicy. I wasn't able to change my drink or get it off the tab even though I only did drink nothing more then two small sips. The food did take a bit long to come and it wasn't that full but the service made up for the wait."}
{"text":"It started with a terrible margarita that was so sour me and my wife joked that it tasted like an old war head sour candy with out the sweet at the end. Next the appetizer came out wrong it was Mexican corn that was supposed to be off the cob but it was on which wasn't a big deal but then the food came out and it was also wrong sauce that wasn't supposed to be on our nachos was on them and the lobster and crab tacos had a wang to them that you never want to taste when eating sea food anywhere they only received two stars because or server was present and checked on us even though it was likely her that turned the orders in wrong and not the kitchen making that many mistakes. The kitchen was open air which is fine but anytime anything was served on a hot plate it created so much smoke and steam it filled up most of the dining room. There were several large tv's with music very loud and played 6 weezer music videos back to back which was terrible and when that was over a migos loop started which was even worse we will not be back"}
{"text":"Jovanny is the best!! Kept the margaritas and chips coming. The best nachos in vegas."}
{"text":"Second visit to this location, but not sure I'll be back to this one as much as I wanna like Nacho Daddy...Stopped in on a weeknight for dinner and drinks. Pretty empty by the looks of things, but the hostess had us wait quite a while to be seated. Had some time to peek into the scorpion terrarium near the door, but only saw crickets waiting to be eaten. We'll revisit that part later.  Used my check-in offer for the house marg which was super sweet and not very buzz-inducing, but a nice gesture nonetheless.  Food came out quickly in generous portions. BBQ chicken nachos hit the spot and were packed with flavor, not lacking any meat or toppings. Their BBQ sauce is a surprising winner.  Now for our uninvited table guest...Lord knows if he came from outside or the terrarium up front, but a big juicy cricket hopped right on up to look me eye to eye just as I was finishing my nachos. Not very appetizing. The manager gave us 25% off the bill which amounted to about $6. Maybe more of a concession would've been made if I had bitten into the darn thing, but glad I had a gift certificate to use anyway to cover the rest.  I know eating scorpions is the thing here, but the only animal I wanted was chicken."}
{"text":"The food sucks. Service was attentive, that's why one star was given. No filet mignon on the nacho appetizer. Rip off! Thank you for the tomatoes and onion overload. Will not return. Over promise and under deliver!!"}
{"text":"Always love this place all the nachos are amazing and the servers are very friendly! Highly recommend if you love nachos!"}
{"text":"Although this place is just odd from the entrance having a huge tank of crickets from what we saw...servers aren't your stereotypical Hispanic because of the name/ that's where I fell in love with this place! The diversity made me feel right at home!!!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! This place is awesome! We had the guac, quest and chips. Very delicious!! Then the Thai Chicken nachos. Best nachos I've ever had. Lots of chicken and delicious sauce. They will getting in my belly at least one more time on our trip!!! Our server was Ryan and he was great!!!  Went back for a second night of Thai Chicken Nachos. Just as delicious as the first time!! Our server Victoria was beyond amazing!! So bubbly and friendly!!  It's a must stop in Vegas!!  Had to go back one more time for the breakfast! Our server was Daria. Again, another amazing server. What a ray of sunshine! I ordered an orange juice and she asked if I wanted ice in it. No one has ever asked me that before. I always want ice in my juice. Yes.....ORANGE WITH ICE IS A THING!!! Great breakfast, great service, great place! Sad it's our last day,. Would have liked to try dessert,"}
{"text":"Wow, so bizarre. The food was very sub-par: chewy chicken and the chips were a little funky. The margaritas were AWFUL. They were too sweet and too tart, however that's possible - but they gave me a headache drinking them. The service wasn't very good: when the waitress asked why we hadn't finished our drinks and we said they weren't good, she didn't say anything and just walked away. Definitely wouldn't recommend it here."}
{"text":"Great staff great food! We had street tacos, nachos and seafood enchiladas. Yum!  Nachos were big enough to share and piled with delicious goodies. Will go again."}
{"text":"MJ is always fantastic. Smiling and prompt. Great atmosphere and staff. They are always busting their butts to get you a table quickly. Always clean. The food is always excellent. Edward was fantastic as well. Very professional and courteous. We always come back to this location."}
{"text":"Bomb food, good vibes, great server AJ, very helpful knew the menu and the beers up and down! 10/10 would come again."}
{"text":"This is a casual spot just off the strip in Vegas. It was nice to get away from the crazy crowds and enjoy a good meal after a great show. We ordered naked wings and a few nachos. From my seat I could see the kitchen and I noticed that the nachos were sitting there for almost 10 minutes under the heat lamp. It turns out that they were waiting for our wings to come out and they take a while. Eventually a waiter came to our table and asked if we would like to start with the nachos, even though the wings are technically the appetizer. We, of course, said yes!   I shared the Fiesta Nachos. So good. The chicken was shredded and had a lot of flavor. The chicken itself wasn't spicy in my opinion, but there were some jalapeños throughout the nacho mound. I do think that the chips got a little soggy because they were sitting out for a while, but the flavor was still good. The naked wings were also fine. I'm not a huge wings person but they've tasted good to me and came with a variety of sauces on the side.   Everyone in my party used the Yelp check in to get a free house margarita. One of the best margaritas I've ever had, and it was free!! If you love nachos and other Mexican type cuisine, check out Nacho Daddy at any hour of the day or night."}
{"text":"Excellent service by our waitstaff.  The manager came over and told us we would get a 20% discount for wearing our golden knights apparel on game day.  We will definatley be adding nacho daddy to our vegas knights game night routine.  The food was excellent too"}
{"text":"Hey...get the nachos...it is in the name. Damn they were good. The chips stayed crisp almost the entire way through our meal. There is an entire vegan/vegetarian menu...very good. We  ordered the Tostado nachos and loaded vegan nachos. VERY GOOD. We will be back!! Ordered the DADDYS MARGARITA and a house margarita...amazing there is a difference. I like Daddy's much better but you get a free house margarita if you check in using YELP...greater starter. Don't miss it."}
{"text":"Ordered the Ceviche.  Super yummy. Enjoyed the Flan for dessert,   Both were excellent"}
{"text":"It was so bomb! I really enjoyed my food. The platter waa huge, it's enough for two. Not knowing that, my boyfriend and I definitely had to take it to go. I got the supreme nachos and he got the bbq chicken. It wasn't a long wait at all. Definitely worth to stop by!"}
{"text":"Nachos were bomb. Margaritas were strong! Scorpion shot was interesting, got nice shot glass to take home."}
{"text":"I've passed this place many times saying I was going to try it. I can't believe it took me this long, will be back. Super friendly staff"}
{"text":"Thanks to the yelp reviews for leading us here! Worth an extra walk just to come. Hit the spot when we were hungry and even though the service was slightly slow to start they really made up for it during our dining time.  Absolutely Gaga over the bold flavors on these nachos... not Tex mex! This San Diegan appreciated the spice and flavor and after eating the food appreciated that there is a wait for a reason. Our spicy shrimp nachos were amply stacked with jumbo shrimp. The juicy filet mignon steak nachos complimented the spicy shrimp perfectly and there was no skimping on seafood or quality steak. This is almost 4.5 stars in my opinion as the prices were not bad considering the portion, flavor and quality!"}
{"text":"OMGoodness I love this place. It has become a common haunt whenever I am in the city. The GN nacho special is amazing if you like jalapeños. Make sure you leave room for desert - not something I would say at most Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Good nachos. Ordered chicken but the salsa on the side. Got a side of rice so it all made a really good meal. The free margarita from Yelp was very good. Be sure to check in"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food and the great service from our server MJ. She was awesome and recommended the Cheeseburger Nachos and Fiesta Nachos. We also got a free margarita from Yelp Check-in and Deep Fried Ice cream for dessert. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Tyler was our server today. He was super helpful and very friendly. The margaritas are very good, and I love all the vegan options! They need one of these on every street."}
{"text":"Loved the avocado tacos!  It was nice to find some yummy plant based food on the strip.  It was so good I came back twice."}
{"text":"Being vegan, I was so excited to see that this restaurant had a vegan menu. We've been back many times. The GM is a vegan, which makes us want to keep coming back. The only reason I'm docking a star is because we came once on \"meatless\" Monday and they were out of the vegan chicken BUT we will definitely keep coming back. Of the 3 locations, this is our favorite."}
{"text":"We loved this place so much, we went twice while we were in LV recently.  Our first visit was mid-morning, and we were hungry. Some of us love breakfast, some of us don't (kind of a hard group to work with in the mornings. . .). We had heard great things about Nacho Daddy, so we walked around the corner from Planet Hollywood, and found a seat at the bar. Kasandra greeted us, and quickly suggested the Bacon Cheese Enchiladas for my breakfast-loving husband. The rest of us ordered Crispy Chicken Sandwiches and Pork Tacos. Needless to say, we were so happy with the food and the service (thanks, Kasandra!) we came back the next afternoon for snacks before going to the airport.  Be sure to check in on YELP, for the free house Margarita (with entrée purchase)."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast.  Traditional American breakfast is really good and Breakfast taco was awesome.  Reasonable prices.  Check in on yelp for free margarita.  Will definitely be back when we come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Loved the atmosphere, food, drinks and customer service! The specialty nachos are amazing as well as the enchiladas. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. One server that stood out was Jovanny. Unbelievable customer service. Truly made me and my family have an outstanding dining experience!!! All I have to say is go here! And request Jovanny!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The service here is amazing! Justin, Richard and Alan all really took care of me and went above and beyond to make sure I had a good experience. I had the Buffalo nacho and was surprised by how good it was and how much you get for your money. I will definitely be coming back! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Came here for their vegan menu and was not dissappointed!!! So so SO good and the amount of different things I could order was unreal. I finally decided on their chick'n nachos in which they even make a vegan cheese and sour cream that was not similar to the real thing but, was yummmmmy! The nachos even come with spinach chips!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Doing a scorpions shot was fun. But please note that free margarita doesn't mean free. After we received our drinks we were told we needed to order an entree to receive the free drink so we had to change our appetizer to a meal. It ended up being ok but I just don't like free not meaning free. Plus there's nothing  in the print that says a meal is required so that was annoying."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic, especially the very hot cheese(!) on the nachos. One thing, I heard MmmBop by Hanson like 3 times while I was eating, and I kept retching up my hot cheese and nachos. If Nacho Daddy stopped playing Hanson for life, it would be a three star Michelin restaurant like French Laundry. Please stop playing Hanson, for the love of God."}
{"text":"I would not bother . Out of hot sauce ,soda was flat . The nachos came out cold the manager could have cared less and the wait staff id horrible. The food was made wrong and itr only took over two hours get out of there. menu could be promising this is our second horrendous experience thought we would give it another try ."}
{"text":"Someone told us about this place. Glad we came here. It was fricken awesome. Got BBQ chicken nachos to split and they were delicious. Wife got American Tacos , she enjoyed them and I got the grilled fish tacos and they had an awesome taste , tender and juicy. Very good value for cost. The service was also very good. Shame there isn't one in Los Angeles. At least when we come here it's a place we know. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"As an ex employee I am trying to get my yelp reviews up for the community and my honest review of this place from a guest perspective is amazing. The food is nachos brought to a whole other level but that's not what makes this place unique the staff is very friendly and the new General Manager Peter truly has the guests best interest in mind. Nacho Daddy is a new company but you can tell will be around for a very long time. Best in Vegas margaritas and they hold the title high and definitely earned it. The atmosphere is defiantly a party/bar atmosphere where you can have a great time with friends and take advantage of the awesome cocktails. If your visiting and looking for a memorable experience get a scorpion shot, you defiantly won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place. It was delicious, would definitely come again. Nachos were delicious (many options), breakfast burrito was simple yet tasty, and the wings were flavorful. Also, our server/waitress, Gabby, was terrific! Very attentive, polite, thorough, efficient service. We were celebrating a birthday, and she helped make it great."}
{"text":"Pretty darn goods nachos I have tried many good Mexican place and this is the best on the strip. It is a fun place and they have really attentive and friendly service. They price is stopping me from giving 5 stars but the nachos are good so they get a solid 4 stars"}
{"text":"seriously nasty and obnoxiously overpriced.  10 bucks for a draft beer in a warm mug.  not a good way to start.   I also tried 3 street tacos (pork, chicken and beef).  other than the pork taco being similar to a salt lick, they were pretty flavorless.  on a dare I also tried the Mexican corn on the cob.  I know it's nearly winter and realize that no self-respecting restaurant would ever serve \"fresh\" corn on the cob this time of year, but I couldn't resist (if only to have something to write about on yelp).  it was truly gross. a single, lifeless ear of corn most likely cooked some time yesterday or the day before and heated up for service.  at 6 bucks I could only laugh.  it lived down and exceeded my lowest expectations. zero chance this place will make it.  if I want food this lame and this overpriced, i'll go down to the strip."}
{"text":"Heck yeah! I had no idea they were planning on opening new locations of this restaurant around the city! I was so pumped to have it in the Miracle Miles connected to my hotel. (Note that if you're looking for it, it does not connect to the inside of the shop area - it only has an outside entrance.)  Yayyy they had their scorpions stocked! I had been to the downtown location over a year ago looking for the scorpion shots, and they had run out of scorpions. I was so psyched to get to try them this time, and the location so convenient.  The bartender recommended a really smooth silver tequila - I can't remember what it was. It came in a double shot, totaling $14 I think. Totally worth it! However... I did not dare eat/swallow the scorpion. I was not that adventurous. I totally disappointed everyone in the restaurant who watched when they heard the bartender ring the bell (they do that to bring attention to someone buying the scorpion shot). Oh well, I got my photo and experience of having a dead scorpion in my mouth for a few seconds! Haha.  OH YEAH and they have a vegan section fo their menu I never knew about. Since I am trying to have the majority of my meals plant-based now, this will be great for me!"}
{"text":"The steak sirloin nachos were mouthwatering, also the margaritas did not disappoint! The wait staff was really helpful and we got our food so quickly! I'd say about 5 minutes? Also lots of screens with different games showing so I'd say great for sports fans."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place was really cool. The menu choices was a wide variety of items that all looked delicious. However, the service was extremely slow. Our server forgot to put out order in and what was delivered to the table was incorrect. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great for late night munchies! We ordered the filet mignon nachos and shrimp tacos. Everything was delicious! The shrimps were cooked perfectly and the nachos portion was huge! I would definitely come back when I'm in Vegas again to try the other nacho options."}
{"text":"This review is late but I wanted to share my great experience here. The waiter was very helpful explains every item on the menu to myself and family the portion as far as my children and what they could eat by themselves. The establishment was very clean. The nachos were nothing short of amazing we had the filet Mignon and the spicy shrimp nachos. It was my birthday so I received an item from the desert menu for free. Football was on the screen playing an my only issue was no scorpions for the scorpion shot. But our helpful waiter explained why I was out of luck on that. If you ever have the opportunity get the filet Mignon nachos the portion can feed two and the flavor was incredible."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Five stars all the way I can't think of one complaint at all.  Me and my friend didn't want to take our chances at the Excalibur buffet so we came down here.  Man I'm glad we did, the service was superb both the bartenders were mad cool.  They were fun, easy to talk too, informative, and available.  The food was awesome, I got the four cheese nachos with chicken added.  My buddy got the Buffalo chicken nachos, they had some heat to them.  Both were great the portions were perfect, filled you up without contracting the \"Itis\" haha.  Ambiance was cool too and the beer selection was on point as well.  Ditch the Strip buffets and come here!!!"}
{"text":"Nachos. Until I came to this establishment I considered the humble nacho to be a food of last resort - a half-arsed foodstuff assembled from random, simple ingredients. My world view has been radically and irretrievably blown. Nacho daddy elevates the drizzlage of cheese on a corn chip to an art form. It is an art of many and varied unexpected sauces; of wondrous carbohydratey goodness which fills the void at the bottom of your soul with warm gooey happiness. Go here, and expect to be religiously transformed from your taste buds to your stomach region. Well played nacho daddy. Will you be my daddy?"}
{"text":"This was my second time eating here.  Everything is prepared fresh.  Staff was very friendly and gave good recommendations on what to heat here.  Great atmosphere.  Definate return customer for life!"}
{"text":"We walked from Treasure Island to this place on a really hot day and it was totally worth it. We ordered the Enchilada nachos, soo bomb! The staff was friendly and good beer selection."}
{"text":"We wanted something different for take out last night.  After looking at the menu online, I called and ordered a Mexican Street burger and a Cuban sandwich.  I ordered both with garlic parmesan fries one of the sides that comes with the sandwiches.  I was told 15 minutes and that was about exactly right although I was thjere early because they're so close to where I live.  My wife enjoyed the Mexican burger and the fries very much.  My sandwich was good but it's not a Cuban sandwich.  It's pulled pork and a slice of ham with some cheese on a toasted baguette and not a pressed sandwich as every authentic Cuban sandwich should be.  I liked the fries.  The packing for take out was good.  It was firm plastic but on the cold day we had, it wasn't the best insulator.  It wasn't a good day for takeout for most places with the cold.  The sandwiches were OK but nothing I'd get again.  Pricey for what you get.  Too many good places around."}
{"text":"I came to the restraunt thinking it was the best and turns out that I got very horrible service from a watress (SHAWN). I honestly felt so desrepected and discriminated on behalf of his help. He rather help a white family out then a mexican family. I really felt like leaving beacuse of his bad service. Dont recommend this nacho daddy."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the music. The food was ok not that great but could use some tweaking on the beans. Our waitress was very attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"Wow the house margaritas were amazing and they did not skimp on the alcohol even though it was free with checkin. Lots of vegan options. Vegan Chimichanga was delicious, as well as the loaded vegan nachos."}
{"text":"The day we came in for lunch was a pretty busy Sunday. We had heard great things about this place from tourists and locals, so I was excited to try it. It's a huge space with really interesting decor and a variety of music videos on the TV playlist.   The vegan options on the menu were a pleasant surprise-- I got vegan nachos and the queso was almost as good as the real thing.   Unfortunately, despite the enjoyable drinks and an interesting and varied menu, the experience pretty much felt like a waste of 2.5 hours. The service was slow, the bar was so backed up that we were encouraged not to order second drinks, which was a first for me, and the crowded restaurant mixed with the high ceilings made it nearly impossible to have a conversation.   What could have been a relaxing lunch left me anxious to leave and disappointed to have chosen the wrong restaurant during a short weekend trip."}
{"text":"The chicken enchilada nachos was great and the environment was awesome as well! Prices weren't bad for Vegas either. The Michelada wasn't the best but not horrible. Overall I will definitely be going back when I got back to Vegas! Lives up to the name for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was good, had nachos and enchilada plate. There was not a ton of people in the place, sat at the bar and it took forever to get first drink. Restaurant was quiet and once bartender started serving it was not bad, just need a few more staffing the place"}
{"text":"I went out to eat here on my lunch break. Me and one other table were in the place around 11 am. I waited 45 minutes for a plate of NACHOS!!!! I had r sit myself and waited 15 minutes before anyone even brought me a water. The bartender and our host just sat by the tv playing around and chit chatting. Completely ignored me. After over paying for nachos that came out 45 minutes later and cold, I was so upset I just left after paying my bill. I couldn't believe how disregarded I felt."}
{"text":"I was staying at a nearby hotel and was hungry for some food.  Since this place is walking distance, I decided to give it a try.  I called and the hostess was friendly and accommodating.  I thought since their name as Nachos in it, it's their specialty. I decided on a fajita nacho and an ice tea to go. She advised me the order will take 10-15 mins.  I promptly arrived in 12 mins and the hostess took care of the tab and went to the kitchen to pick up the order.  I took it back to my room. Upon opening the box, I was instantly disappointed.  I did order nachos, but what I got was missing the key ingredient...\"nacho cheese\". The tortillas were covered with some kind of red sauce, chicken, a few sprinkles of shredded cheese. The red sauce was salty and not tasty at all. I was so disappointed. I mean if this is suppose to be your claim to fame then you should not be serving this dish.  Unfortunately, this place is a no to me."}
{"text":"The nachos are amazing but even better with their amazing margaritas!!! Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Me and my husband went here for the first time and loved it!! It's difficult to choose because they have so many options to select from. We tried the bbq chicken nachos and enchilada chicken nachos. The ambiance was chill and our server, Phillip was real cool. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Not a value for a regular dinner... but nice beer pub.   I was not wooed like I expected. My daughter ordered the Vegan Nachos and for $16 we got 1/2 oz of vegan cheese and a few grilled veggies on a pile of dry chips. It was the same portion as the \"appetizer chips and salsa\" which were properly priced at $3.50 . Waiter said the Vegan dish was a large portion and \"sharable\". The rest of us ordered smaller dishes counting on that. Boy were we surprised. The \"huevos rancheros were ok for $10, the cheeseburger was fair priced but is not a \"deal\" and the tortilla soup was a large cup, not a bowl - but again fair for the price ($5 or so). Good 80's videos, nice bar - Ill go there to drink but its not a dinner spot for us in the future. The menu is extensive but the quality/portion vs dollar value is that of \"Bar food\". There are much better places to eat for less money."}
{"text":"The filet mignon nachos are amazing, definitely recommend! The bartenders are awesome and super friendly. Their house margarita is also delish! Definitely need to check this spot out while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The spicy shrimp nachos were very good but Kayla our server was AMAZING! I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"This place came highly reviewed, and it didn't disappoint. We came in for breakfast. I got the steak Omelet and my wife got the Huevos Rancheros, both were pretty amazing.  Portions were large (wife didn't finish hers). Service was pretty on point too. Water glass was never empty, coffee refills on the spot. Our server (Cassandra) was pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Our server, DJ, was so great! He brought the birthday boy in our group a great shot of tequila, and our food was served really quickly! Great quality--the queso was my favorite part of the meal. The margaritas are amazing, and I especially loved the blackberry one."}
{"text":"I've done reviews for this nacho daddy before. And it was a good review. This time our service was good we were seated right away. Almost to the end of the meal a hair was found in the food. This was a short dark hair. I don't know if this has happened to anyone before but you he this nauseated feeling in your stomach and you appetite is ruined. I had no problem telling the waitress and she told the manager. This is the problem I have, the manager didn't come out and apologize she sent the waitress back out who said  the manager took the entree off your bill and the chips and salsa. And then she said sometimes these things happen.   Excuse me sometimes these things happen you don't tell a customer that EVER. She was making it sound like it was ok and it's not ok . That's disgusting unsanitary who the hell is in the kitchen and why aren't they wearing a hair net because it wasn't long enough to pull back . I'm pretty sure we won't be back"}
{"text":"So I read the \"consumer alert\" about this place and I hesitated before deciding to come here. If a place has to write their own reviews to boost up their star rating, they must not be doing something right.   So I came with a good amount of awareness that this meal may not go very well, but much to my surprise, I had a very pleasant breakfast. We had a mad hankering for some nachos and this place seemed to fit the bill.  Our server was prompt and willing to give us lots of recommendations. She did have a hard time explaining the switch over from the old beer list to whatever they had on tap now. Either way, the pale ale being offered was good.   The supreme tostada nachos were plentiful and came out all gooey. Quite the site to see.  The chilaquiles were so good! The tortilla chips were not soggy, even though it had the enchilada sauce tossed on it. The chicken on it was so good too!  Also, they have a great Yelp check-in deal! If so inclined, You can even pay the difference for better tequila in your margarita!  Honestly, this place was awesome! No need to post their own reviews, just keep dishing out those awesome nacho dishes!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate at Nacho Daddy last night. The nachos satisfied my nacho craving. Our server, Tiffany, was friendly and efficient. The service at this location is superb! The manager was also kind. Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Great service, thanks Gabby! We had the fajitas bowls and they were fresh, delicious and filling. We both checked in and received complimentary margaritas! We're here for several days so we will be back. Prices were reasonable in an expensive city."}
{"text":"We had some good food and a few laughs. Sat outside and still had a good view of the TV. The server and the manager were good to have around and took care of everything. Be back again."}
{"text":"(No pictures...food was too good) Came here around 11 pm after the SuperBowl... really nice. No wait. Food was delicious... I had the Cali Burrito... and to say the least it was GREAT!!! The Margaritas are okay... My only problem was the fan!!! It was really cold and despite my numerous request to turn the fan off, it NEVER happened. End result.. cold fries but they were good for the short period they were still hot. Also...  did a Yelp check-in and got a FREE house margarita!!! Whooo hoooo... can't say NO to that!!!"}
{"text":"Vegan loaded nachos were the absolute best. The margarita was actually good (for someone who doesn't ever drink. Great customer service. Fiancé attempted the scorpion shot and that was fun lol."}
{"text":"Our waiter, DJ went above and beyond today when serving us! Literally the best server I've ever had in a long time. I'm rating the restaurant 5/5 just because of him."}
{"text":"I can give it a good 3 1/2 stars!  Truth be told, we visited Nacho Daddy off the basis of a Groupon.  Without it, I was teetering on the fence about visiting here.  Mainly because even though I love me some nachos, I usually have no problem making it at home (and I do make a pretty mean one).  But in the end I saw some flavors on the Nacho Daddy menu that were intriguing.  It's not hard to make me happy when it comes to nachos, I mean I even like the ones at the local 7-11!    The fam and I went on a weekend for lunch and was a bit surprised the place was fairly empty.  There was football on the TV!  Nachos!  Beer!  Women in tight tops!  Would have thought Nacho Daddy would have been more filled in for a sports day.  There were only like 6 - 8 tables taken when we got there, and a fairly empty bar area.  We were seated promptly at a nice corner table near the windows.  Our server was very personable and fairly quick.  Looking at the menu we all decided to get two nacho entrees to share and a salad to go along with it.  We decided on:  *Nacho Average Burger Nachos ($10.95) - seasoned ground beef, applewood smoked bacon, yellow queso sauce, red onions, tomatoes & shredded lettuce over house made corn chips  *Florentine Nachos ($11.95) - grilled chicken breast, sun dried tomatoes, bacon, spinach, topped with Asiago, Romano & Parmesan cheese sauce, all over spinach corn chips  *Kale Salad ($6.95 & a Nacho Daddy favorite) - kale with cucumber, corn, grape tomatoes, mushrooms, red onions & avocado with an agave citrus vinaigrette  You might think that with the advert of house made chips at Nacho Daddy you would get a complimentary bowl of them along with some house salsa at each table.  Isn't the chip supposed to be your strong point?  Why not a sample?  But not the case here.  If you want it, Bottomless Chips & Salsa are offered at $2.95 for every 4 guests.  Not a big deal, but it did kinda bother me a bit.  Oh well, price of doing business I suppose.  Didn't take too long for our orders to come out, maybe around 20 minutes.  All looked pretty fresh!    Nacho Average Burger Nachos were good.  Basically like a cheeseburger on a nacho!  While delicious, I didn't think this was really something I couldn't attempt to make at home.  Chips were crunchy, with a fair amount of toppings on top.  But I could have done with more cheese on them, maybe a healthy layer of shredded cheese in the middle of the chip stack BEFORE adding the queso sauce and toppings?  I had a few spots there where my chip didn't get any cheese on them.  The Florentine Nachos were pretty to look at with all the Italian colors of red, white & green.  Thankfully they were tasty as well.  Grilled chicken wasn't dry, and the sun dried tomatoes and bacon added some good contrasting texture.  The white cheese sauce was yummy, but again there wasn't quite enough to go around!  Some of the spinach chips ended up being bare in spots!    Surprisingly, the best thing we had on the table was the Kale Salad!  I would go back to Nacho Daddy just for this!  Possibly make it a meal next time with the addition of a grilled chicken breast on top!  This salad was downright great, even though the rest of my fam didn't like the red onion on it.  I think the vinaigrette is what made their kale salad really good.  It was sweet, sour & tangy, a good mix with the hearty kale & meaty avocado.  I just wish this sucker were bigger!    The manager of Nacho Daddy came to our table towards the end of our meal and asked us how we were doing & if the food was to our liking.  I politely made a small comment about the cheese placement and he told me they would definitely look into making a change on that.  He also suggested on the next visit to try the Thai Chicken Nachos, his current favorite.  Pleasant guy, thanked us for coming in.  Overall Nacho Daddy is going in a good direction for a niche/theme restaurant.  The nachos were tasty but needs some work with getting more cheese in those nooks & crannies.  Also, maybe up the serving a tad?  When I think nachos I think a big pile of chips smothered in goodies.  Adding another little layer of chips would up the wow factor for these guys and add value to their pricing.  I wish the salad were a bit larger as well, but it was enough for three of us to share in smaller servings.  I'd come back again to Nacho Daddy if I had another Groupon handy.  I'm not sure if I'd be back right away without one though, there's just so many other places to dine if you're spending that kind of money.  However, their nacho combinations are hard to beat.  Nacho ordinary joint!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT SERVICE! Food was outstanding. Only thing I suggest is sharing the nachos with someone. They are huge portions"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's easily accessible from Miracle Mile and Planet Hollywood. Even though the menu is Mexican it has great variety and some interesting choices with all of the different nacho dishes. Tonight I had the Nacho Average Burger Nachos and they were outstanding, a perfect combination of chips, ground beef, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and not sure what else but very flavorful!   The bar is open air with great people watching inside and passing on the sidewalk. If you're luck is running hot maybe you will have the opportunity to see my favorite Vegas bartender, the lovely sweetheart Scarlet!  As Arnold once said - 'I'll be back!'"}
{"text":"The food was excellent..... service not so much.  There were plenty of tables but still had to wait over twenty minutes to be seated.  Once seated the waitress tossed the straws at the table.  Thank God the food was good."}
{"text":"A non-food review. Had to sit at the bar because it was going to be a long wait, according to the hostess. Sat at the bar, ordered margaritas, then nothing. Looked at the food menu while we were waiting, and waiting, for the margaritas. We made our selection and waited for the bartender to come back. She never came back. She made other drinks, took orders from other customers and basically ignored us. We ended up leaving after 15 minutes. We never even got water."}
{"text":"I ordered for pickup from this location and I am very, very disappointed. I was excited to try the vegan chicken nachos, but when I got home, I saw there was no chick'n!! I ate them anyways, because the vegan cheese was pretty tasty, but halfway through I found a very long dark hair, presumably from the host who gave me my food. Thumbs all the way down!"}
{"text":"Ive been several times now and every single time i get the absolute best service from Jovanny and the absolute best food! I tried the surf and turf taco combo tonight! Delicious!! And i had the watermelon margarita. Amazing. Love this place. Great staff. Great food!"}
{"text":"I foolishly ordered the wings.....which were not epic!  Stick with the nachos choices"}
{"text":"Came by before the Knights game and if I wasn't going to the game then I'd come here to watch it! Tons of tvs and a giant projector with a great sound system. It's half outside and half in so you get the best strip experience while staying in air conditioning. Margaritas are on point and the food is incredible, incredible! Great value for your money, especially for being located on the strip! Peter is an awesome guy and our bartender Sierra was efficient and amazing! I love this place and will be back!!"}
{"text":"Sadly I have to downgrade my previous review due to really horrible service but I ate at the bar so I think that the problem was the bartender. The food was great so I recommend NOT eating at the bar, the bartender seemed too overwhelmed by her responsibilities or she just didn't give a crap about someone who wasn't drinking and just wanted to eat,  Sit at a table and you will be OK"}
{"text":"This is probably the best biggest noches I've ever had. Every time I come to Vegas, guess where I'm going... one nacho plate feeds 2! Good price too!"}
{"text":"Cool place, cool atmosphere, but if you're in town from Texas, don't get mexican food.  It is not the same.    Bartender was nice and the place was pretty laid back on a Tuesday Night in May. Relaxing at the bar."}
{"text":"I saw this place on the Tanked Tv show.  It didn't disappoint!  Scorpion Tank by the door is a neat started.  I had the nachos and would recommend.  I had the Tostada Nachos.  Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Large portions and great service but the music is so loud and awful it killed my experience. Foo fighters every other song I'm losing my mind and couldn't wait to leave! I'm never coming back. The food is good but not great. Enchilada nachos green sauce was incredibly bland might as well not have been on it. Huge selection of very interesting beer and an unbelievable selection of margaritas. Prolly best to go for drinks during happy hour and who cares about the food kinda thing. But face it... This is Vegas and there is a very long list of much better food and environment than here."}
{"text":"Came here looking for some good eats after being disappointed at the Carnival buffet the previous night. The free margaritas were nice. I was leaning towards the fajitas, but as a visitor I felt like I needed to get the nachos for the name sake. Glad I did! Service was friendly but a little slow, but we didn't mind.. we were in Vegas!! I would definitely recommend if you are walking the Strip and want to take a break and grab a bite!"}
{"text":"Great time at the golden knights watch party. Great staff and amazing food. Go Knights Go!"}
{"text":"Right when you walk in there is a tank filled with 4-6 scorpions and crickets!  They have plenty of seating but it is a little hard to get into. I'd recommend parking at planet Hollywood and then walking through miracle mile and then walking outside.  Free margarita with check in!  Also ordered the enchiladas and they were pretty tasty! Good amount of cheese and great value for the price!  Our waitress was also amazing! Made sure everything went smoothly and separated checks with no hassle!"}
{"text":"Sorry Daddy, but you are Nacho my type.  I have dined at the downtown Nacho Daddy location and I also attended a Yelp Elite event at this location.  I returned to this location shortly before 6 pm on a Tuesday with a friend who had never been to Nacho Daddy.   Despite it being happy hour, there was not very many people dining and we were quickly taken to a large and comfortable booth to wait for our server. Personally, I felt like service was a little slow considering how empty the place was, but our waitress was very friendly.  We started out with margaritas which were excellent. No complimentary chips and salsa here, Daddy's a stingy one.   Since there was a taco Tuesday special (3 for $5), we decided to share a plate of the avocado tacos that I thought were the standout item served at the Elite event. Sadly, these were not as light and crispy as I remembered and they were served drenched in salsa.    I had never ordered nachos from either of the Nacho Daddy locations I had been to, so it seemed fitting that we share some and we decided on the Filet Mignon Nachos. While the nachos are quite large and easily enough for two people to share, I found the ingredients to not be well dispersed and the ranchero sauce overpowered the other flavors on the plate.   Total damage for 2 margaritas, the tacos which were on special and a plate of nachos to share was over $50, pretip. While this is by no means overboard for a dinner on the Strip, I do think it was a bit high for what we actually received.   I will keep Nacho Daddy in mind for the rare occasions I need a vegan-friendly spot to take guests for a meal. Personally, I don't foresee myself coming back for more than a margarita."}
{"text":"Queso was amazing! Margarita was cold and strong. Guacamole is better at chipotle, but the medium salsa and the queso made up for that. Filet steak nachos were great, like always more steak would have been better. This will be on our to do list next time we travel to Vegas."}
{"text":"Love this place. Happy hour is awesome, great food. Large vegetarian/vegan selection and tequila Tuesday (buy one get one). I always sit at the bar so can't talk about the dining room, but Zack and Jasmine are fun, friendly and always have good recommendations for food and drink."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place.  1. Because I love nachos/Mexican food. And  2. Because they have vegan options! Yay!  Well we got there around 9pm and the place was empty other than the one other table that they sat us right next to. Which is whatever. Looking at the menu, we see that the vegan nachos are $16, which is retarded, but we figured they MUST be good for that price so we ordered them, along with the Mexican corn. The corn was good, I have had better, but it was a reasonable price so that was a plus. The nachos came out and it was literally mostly dry chips with toppings only on the first layer of chips. Such a disappointment. Why are they charging so much for such a poor excuse for food? And to top it all off, our waiter was walking around in the dining room texting on his phone?!   I wouldn't recommend this place and won't be back."}
{"text":"Awesome place and friendly staff. A must if you're in Vegas. Sierra and Peter were both awesome!"}
{"text":"On a quest to find a good place to eat in the area I saw the high ratings on Yelp and figured I would give this place a try. The Chicken Burrito was good as well as their chips and queso. Their pricing is fair and they have a lot of good choices on their menu and enough staff to accommodate all the traffic they get! I wasn't sure if we had someone new or if our waiter was flustered when we ordered and asked questions about the menu, but it was still a good experience."}
{"text":"Matt was  a great server.  This was my 1st time ever eating here and I have driven by 100 times   Great atmosphere.   Just mad I can't have my 20 year old gf sit on patio"}
{"text":"Delicious margaritas with our late breakfast! My husband had the amazing steak omelet & I ordered the churro pancake which btw is about a foot across!!"}
{"text":"One of my go-to breakfast places on the strip (or strip adjacent if we want to be technical).   The service is quick and the food is good - especially after a night of drinking.   I gave 4 stars for this review because the beer listing on the menu wasn't correct and the server had to go back and forth to the bar to verify what they had on tap. Not fun for the server!   Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"Ordered from door dash , never had Nacho Daddy before and it surprised me how good it was, QUESO WAS"}
{"text":"I usually try to not eat on the strip.  The nachos here are pretty good.  Like their motto says not a dry chip.  We had a great server named Gio.  They got the football game on the big screen when we asked.  I recommend the BBQ Pulled Pork nachos and Margaritas.  Both were fantastic!  Only drawback was the kids quesadilla, it was super soggy and didn't look very appetizing."}
{"text":"Second meal in Vegas! We saw an episode of Mystery Diners and thought the food looked yummy! Couldn't wait to try their nachos and some of the other offerings.   The host was on break when we came in....3 of the four servers on the floor looked at us and just went about their duties. I was mildly pissed off and about to leave. The hostess finally came down and I made sure she didn't seat us with any of them. Our resultant server, Ryan, was a sweetie pie!  We've been sitting for about 25 minutes drinking water. Our appetizers have yet to come out despite the fact that it's barely half full. I ordered the Sloppy Joe nachos and my daughter ordered the fiesta nachos. They were awesome!  I asked for a few red onions...so not disappointed! My daughter also loved hers.   Today is Taco Tuesday...we got two pork and one beef. Thank God they are only $5....they were horrendous (blech). HUGE benefit? Check in on Yelp for a free margarita!   So the manager just came by and offered to comp part of our meal and give my daughter a free dessert for her birthday! We got the apple pie nachos! OMG!! Soooo delicious. The nachos are soft and flavorful. Sweet and savory. The apples are fried to perfection and the whipped cream Is fresh so yum!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome and the ambiance is great! Our server Aly did an awesome job serving all 30 of us. Didn't even make a mistake and our food came it right away. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Jovanny was awesome. Great service , great food. I had the the breakfast burrito and it was great."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch on a Tuesday. Really great deals on tacos and tequila! My boyfriend and I ordered three tacos and split an order of supreme nachos. All of which were quite tasty. The nachos, although good, seemed like your basic loaded nachos but the price was a little more than I would have quoted it to be. The service was fantastic and the atmosphere set you on vacation."}
{"text":"This place has vegan chocolate cake! What more needs to be said? Actually the \"chicken\" fajitas were really good too and the staff was nice. Good location"}
{"text":"Great vegan food that is affordable.  The portions are huge.  The chef even came out to our table and served our food.  We loved the vegan Nachos and the vegan \"chicken\" fajitas.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. Nachos hit the spot and the spicy cucumber margaritas were very good"}
{"text":"Came in about an hour before closing and sat at the bar for beers and an appetizer.  We usually go to the downtown location but live in the Summerlin side of town now so wanted to give the new location a try.  Nick the bartender was very attentive and overheard me say chips and salsa to the person I was with and quickly turned around and said, \"did I hear chips and salsa?\" He put our order in and I added on the 3 street tacos with shrimp, fish, and carne Asada.  Food came out pretty quick and I enjoyed everything.  I don't expect authentic Mexican food but when I go to Nacho Daddy I expect good food and a fun atmosphere which is exactly what I got!  I was still hungry so I ordered the queso fundido which I really enjoyed also, I will definitely come back to try more things on the menu and try out their happy hour.  * they play music videos at the bar which is a plus since I never see music videos anywhere anymore! See you soon Nacho Daddy!"}
{"text":"Nice quick lil spot for margaritas and tacos.  They have a nice Lil lunch menu and I enjoy them for that. I wouldn't eat here for dinner but I think it's a cool spot for mid day activity"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican restaurant just near the main Strip area (right near Planet Hollywood). They have unique nacho dishes worth trying along with traditional Mexican and Tex-Mex food. Servers are very nice and like a sports bar type of atmosphere with lots of sports games on TVs everywhere. It's a good and fine place to bring kids (don't have to worry about them yelling in a quiet restaurant). According to our waiter, place just opened about 3 months ago, but already very popular. Some dishes are a little pricey, but not as bad as eating at some of the main Strip hotel restaurants. Worth trying!"}
{"text":"Walked in, they quickly sat us for a Friday night. I had a blast there! They are also know for their Scorpion tequila shot. I had the shrimp tacos! Boy was that very good :) my friends got the nachos they were really impressed. I also used the free drink for checking in on here. They know how to make a good Margarita :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. If you're on the boarder about going here or going to your usual Vegas dinner/bar stop, opt for Nacho Daddy instead.   The vibes here are awesome. Walking in and seeing a giant scorpion in a terrarium?! Unreal. Plenty of TV's showcasing sport games? Yes please.   The menu had a ton of \"non nacho\" options for all the haters, but I narrowed my focus to the nacho options. I had to try the filet mignon nachos, which sounded so perfect. I had zero regrets doing so. The nachos were super flavorful, and the beef on there was amazing. Our party all ordered different nachos with the intent to share, but we all horded our own as soon as we got them. Beware of this.   They also have a scorpion shot drink, with a real scorpion in it! We don't drink, but asked if we could have a scorpion anyways to try. It didn't taste great, but added to the experience! Our server was super nice, and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of during our visit.   Overall, be sure to check it out. Don't settle for a mediocre Vegas buffet when you can tour Vegas for cool places like Nacho Daddy."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at nacho daddy was awesome. Great tunes, great food and plenty of it. I ordered the tostadas nachos and they were delicious! I'm not big on spicy and could have done with less jalapeños but these still made a great meal!  Margarita's were delicious as was the happy hour deal on Mexican draft beers!"}
{"text":"Great food but the service needs some work. I didnt get the food I ordered and it took about 20 minutes to get the right food."}
{"text":"What an awesome name, too bad I have 1 bad experience to go with this establishment. My main gripe was that the buffalo nachos were just downright gross. I'm not sure if the buffalo chicken wasn't cooked properly or if buffalo sauce just doesn't go well with nachos. In any case, my recommendation is to never order it.  That said, this place isn't half bad, the drinks are decent and the waitresses were nice. I'm giving this place an extra star just because of the name.  I might give this place another chance if I stay at the Cosmo or any other hotel that's nearby."}
{"text":"Free margaritas not worth the review, extremely sweet.  Best thing out of it was that they were free with the review. Besides that I can't complain because it was free.      Music here was great and it's a nice atmosphere. Would recommend napkins at the tables."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!! Music was on point.  Service was fast, we needed to be done in 45 mins and we were done in 30! Good quick place that doesn't require all of your spending money."}
{"text":"The free marg with a Yelp check-in was solid, but everything else about the meal was just average. For exclaiming bold flavors, etc., I was a little underwhelmed with my meal and it was served on the cold side. My husband got a giant plate of nachos and was certainly impressed with the quantity of food received."}
{"text":"On vacation in need of Mexican food, the place setup was kinda small and hard to maneuver our stroller in however, the staff were friendly and accommodating for my son giving us warm water for his baby bottle. We purchased guacamole and endless chips for our table which went fast. ( definitely not enough guac or chips in my opinion ) but very delicious. The Dr Pepper we ordered was watered down but they immediately changed the syrup in the soda machine for us so we didn't have to wait long. Overall the food came out fast except my tortillas were a kinda dry and brittle for my  fajitas to be rolled up in but delicious non the less. I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Service from Johnathan our server sucked.  Personality of a Rock and mostly rude.   Now that being said, Daddys Margarita was very good and the nachos very good as well.  Did I mention our server not worth the 3 bucks I left him.."}
{"text":"Four stars because I am always pleased when a restaurant offers a few vegan selections. Many of my friends NOT vegan, so it's great to be able to go somewhere they feel comfortable, and I can get something I know follows my preferred eating habits. The food is decent - the ingredients are fresh and the menu is creative. I really like their avocado tacos. I've never been a fan of nacho cheese, vegan or not, so I would rate their vegan cheez as okay, but vegans who miss regular (dairy) nacho cheese might really like it. The service is comparable to other casual restaurants - the servers are friendly and they remember to check in and refill the drinks. You can get in and out quickly if you need to, but they don't seem to mind when I've wanted to linger and catch up with my friends."}
{"text":"It's a little of the strip but totally worth it! I've eaten here twice now and the quality is consistent and service is great!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Nacho Daddy. The nachos were alright but I will go back just because of the exceptional service by Britney! She made sure our drinks were full and my group was happy, despite we were completely indecisive. She made plenty of reccomendations which turned out to be successful especially for my never satisfied husband. Thank you Britney I won't lose any sleep tonight!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, Nacho Daddy needs to expand to Arizona. We had the Fiesta Nachos and they were outstanding! I would also like to give a shout out to Jaclyn behind the bar. I have never seen a harder worker in this industry all the while making sure every one of her customers have everything that they needed. She is worth a visit to the bar over the dining room any day of the week. We are in town for three more days and we are going to come back just to see her again. She truly is the best in the business."}
{"text":"Food was ok (we ordered wings, nachos, and soft tacos) but service was slow. Our server was friendly but we were seated right next to the kitchen where we saw all the madness. Floor was super greasy/slippery (even the bathroom) and we were startled a couple of times from noise of dropping trays."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing!  The nachos were phenomenal, the spicy cucumber margarita was the best margarita I've ever had and our waitress Ari was excellent! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"At Nacho Daddy\"s in Las Vegas AGAIN!! It never fails every time I come here. Love me some queso And pork tacos! Ari was awesome and got everything we wanted quick fast and in a hurry. Can't wait for my next trip to meet with my queso once again!"}
{"text":"I didn't think I would be overly impressed with a chain restaurant but I absolutely love this place.  We got the chicken enchilada nachos and they were amazing. Hot and gooey on every level of chip; a nacho lovers dream. I ordered the street tacos and they were also fantastic. If you're into cheesy bastardized mexican fare, like I am, you won't be disappointed.   The food was delicious, the service was great and This Guy below me blaming his timing and menu issues on the waitress can eat a bag of dicks."}
{"text":"Cool place, first time I've been here and our server DJ was a hell of a server, funny guy, very nice and attentive! Keep up the good work bud! Food wise, it's great I got the Chef special and it was good!"}
{"text":"Asked for sausages got bacon instead. There was practically no wait but still disappointed. There was also hair in food.   Not going back"}
{"text":"When we come to Summerlin Nacho Daddy, we beeline to the bar and hope that Zach is working. We have never had a bad experience with the food. The music is always great! Sitting at the bar is my preference, I get the best of all worlds between Zach's service, the music, and the sports. Let's not forget the food! The food is delicious with lots of flavor. My favorite are the street tacos!"}
{"text":"Staying at the Marriot,i noticed this place called Nacho Daddy. I was intrigued. On my fiancees and I last day we stopped here for lunch. Arieanna our server was friendly right off the bat. Her knowledge of the menu and recommendations were on point. She recommended the supreme tostada nachos. Holy perfect nachos Batman. These were the best nachos ive ever had. The freshness of the ingredients with the perfect balance made this a  masterpiece. Arieanna really knew what she was talking about. Do your self a favor and get down to Nacho Daddy and ask for Arieanna. Thank you so much for the wonderful food and hospitality. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Our group arrive at 5:45 pm Wednesday. It's now 6:24 and still no dinner. It took 15 min to get our water. So far, dissapointed. At this point, I don't care if the food is fantastic. Never coming here again. Our server was keysen. We asked the server about our meal. He said \"it should be out by now, let me check\". ? ? ? Really..... if it's out, why is it not on our table?! The other servers looked very attentive with their customers, while keysen would dissappear.  6:35 and still nothing.  We walked out."}
{"text":"OMG! Some good food here! Our server, MJ was really helpful and was very nice.   Ordered the quesadillas. Best I've ever had! Also ordered the Signature chicken soft tacos. A tad bit salty but still very favorful. The Daddy's Margarita was good and tart. Nice touch to offer a free house Margarita just for checking in via Yelp!  The music was on point too! I will be back!"}
{"text":"So the prices are a bit high but when you get your food you will forget about it!! All I have to say is when can I go back???   The food was amazing and the service was good too!! Glad we checked this place out!!"}
{"text":"Nancy was the best waitress! From the authentic Mexican food to the scorpion shot this place is a hands down must eatery!"}
{"text":"First time here and had an amazing time. There's a large menu offering a variety of foods and an assortment of creative nachos. I had the filet mignon fajitas and they were divine. Good flavor and fast service. Brian was awesome! The desserts amaaaaazing!"}
{"text":"This place is a must try, there ceviche appetizer was so good and there burritos are mouthwatering so cheesy and meaty definitely coming back."}
{"text":"They have a great vegan selection! I only ate here a couple of times because I have since switched to organic only. They are continuing to get vegan items which makes me very happy for the vegan community. They atmosphere is great! We go here sometimes for work and I wish they would have an organic vegan option. Their kale salad used to be my favorite!!! This is a great place for the family as they have a huge variety menu. At this time I will have to discontinue going to Nacho Daddy ( Which breaks my heart) but one day hopefully they will offer organic salads and I will be able to return again!"}
{"text":"The food was SO GOOD!!! The service however, not amazing... The server was friendly, but she was pretty preoccupied with her male coworkers chatting, making our wait times ridiculously long when the place was pretty much empty."}
{"text":"The best LOADED nachos on the strip, my sister a Thai rice bowl which was also full of flavor and our waitress was very sweet. All 5 of us were happy with our order and so happy our hotel concierge at the Hilton recommended it with 20% off our full order!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good gluten free place to eat, and those with issues know how hard that can be!  I found this place on findmeglutenfree.com and, I love nachos, so I checked it out. Best decision I have made on this trip! The staff is super friendly. Special shout out to my waitress, Victoria, for making me feel comfortable and making a fabulous recommendations! The fiesta nachos are the bomb! And the cucumber jalapeño margarita hits the spot! I will be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Ordered filet mignon nachos. It only came with 4 thin, short slices of filet mignon.  Very very stingy restaurant. I live across the street. You have now lost business."}
{"text":"This place has good food. Nothing extraordinary. But I have it 5 stars for the service. Fast and helpful. I can't remember the waitresses name but she had dreadlock. She was super sweet and helped us with our menu."}
{"text":"Had time to spare before my flight home.  I decided to eat there based on Yelp reviews. I went there Monday about 1 pm, and it was not very crowded.   I checked in on Yelp for the free margarita. I ordered the pork BBQ nachos, and they came out very quick. The service was good also."}
{"text":"So, this place was an all around hit for us during our trip to Vegas. The portions were huge, the margaritas were good and had a good amount of tequila in them (not too much though). We had the enchiladas nachos and the filet nachos and they were both delicious. Service was great too - thanks Luz!"}
{"text":"Had My X-MAS company party here and it was a An Awesome Experience, Great Tasting Food (Nachos!!) And The #1 thing I Loved most and a truly made it an Unforgettable Experience Were The Scorpion Shots !! A Must try, if Ever in the Mood for Something Daring !! Can't wait to comeback !!!"}
{"text":"Came there after a hard day of work with my boss and co-worker for dinner.   Cleanliness/Decor The place looked like a sports bar. There were TVs hanging with sporting events everywhere. It was darkly lit and had a romantic feeling (only and if it wasn't a sports bar it could achieve that effect). Also it was pretty clean for what I could see.   Food Food was great! I got street taco plate. My coworkers and I shared some Fiesta Nachos with Filet Mignon. It was delicious! I honestly recommend everybody getting the Fiesta Nachos!  Service Service was GREAT! The waitress was very friendly and helpful.   Overall Experience 4 Stars! Everybody should GO!   Happy Eats Everybody!"}
{"text":"Solid vegan options when you are in need late night... waitstaff was really nice and considerate. Outside seating is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Been waiting awhile to try this place out. I'm a big fan of Nachos but was extremely disappointed with my first dining experience there. Their chicken they use on any nacho platter was super spicy. After we were served the Fiesta Nachos one bite told me it was definitely too spicy for me to eat. An inquiry was made to head cook and we were told that all their chicken is that spicy. We couldn't get enough water after just 1 bite so had to order something else. Needless to say I won't be back. Also it was extremely loud in the restaurant and their acoustics are not made for screaming Golden Night fans. Our server was nice and apologetic but unfortunately it's also the food you must like. Back to my favorite nacho place for now."}
{"text":"Not a bad joint but not the best nacho experience I've had. Portions are large, but in the end I thought the product quality was average.   If you go one order of any of the signature anchors is plenty for two people. Keep in mind it's Vegas so by the time you split an order of nachos and have a couple of margaritas you are in it for $50 plus for well nachos."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, as usual. We ordered the fiesta nachos and they did not disappoint.  Although, our waitress, MJ, did. She took an unusually long amount of time to come to our table when we were seated. In fact, the host actually walked over and interrupted her story time she was having with another server to remind her that she now has a table.   The service after that was decent UNTIL she brought the bill. We put our card in and she walked past 3 different times without grabbing it. After the 3rd time, she was across the way, chatting with another server for at least 7 or so minutes. We tried to make eye contact, get her attention and nothing worked. Finally, her manager walked up and nudged her to come over. My boyfriend mouthed \"thank you\" to the manager and he replied with a \"you're welcome.\"   To the waitress, I am sorry that our business took away from your gossip time. We seriously felt like we were invisible."}
{"text":"Loved this place, will go back. Got my free margarita, fried lobster tacos and nacho supreme. Friendly staff! Excellent food!"}
{"text":"Lots of nachos. They were good. We specifically asked for no jalapeños and the cooks forgot and put them on anyways. Even though they messed up our order our waitress was very accommodating and remedied the food mix up quickly and cheerfully."}
{"text":"Great food, Excellent service, took a star off for the wait.  It was only 40% full on a Saturday early evening, had to wait for over 20 mins to be seated, seemed to be a staffing issue.  We got lucky and had a great server, Taylor B.  She did a great job explaining everything and making suggestions.  She was accommodating with everything.  We took advantage of the Yelp check-in margarita and it was good.  The food came out quickly and it was delicious!  Great evening and definite spot to return!"}
{"text":"Well a few of us ladies decided it was time for happy hour and girls night out. I had never been but my friends had. What a great place for happy hour and yelp provides a free margarita online. Our waiter Anthony was superb.  We gave him grief all in good fun and he was a great sport. We were all full so fast. The tortilla soup was just outstanding and the Thai chicken nachos so good and the crab and shrimp nachos as well.  The servings are huge so consider a doggy bag. Thanks Anthony you were fun. Great service."}
{"text":"Perfect little spot in Vegas, margaritas were delicious and I ordered the enchiladas and weren't that bad. With a check-in you get a free margarita which is nice- who doesn't enjoy a free drink? Our waitress was lovely but unfortunately I don't remember her name :/ the place wasn't busy so our orders came out pretty quick. I recommend this place if you want to relax and enjoy your meal at an inexpensive rate."}
{"text":"Stopped here for happy hour- some of the best happy hour prices on the strip! Good drinks and bartender was great too. 2 margs, nachos and street tacos and my bill was $20; Can't beat it in Vegas!   Food was delicious, I had the Burger Nachos and chicken street tacos. If you're not an onion lover let them know, luckily I am. Looking forward to visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to come here! I love nachos! I know the food will be great. I've only heard great things about this location."}
{"text":"Loved it... very big portions! And the service is out of this world! OH and I took the scorpion shot"}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp whilst looking for nearby Mexican fare.  Judy was our waitress and she was knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and helpful.  We ordered based on her recommendations from our delicious margaritas to the super nacho and sizzling shrimp tacos.  You will not be sorry if you give it a try."}
{"text":"Had lunch at the bar. Chase was a great bartender and server! Great atmosphere. Access from Harmon Ave is easy. Nachos are amazing. Shrimp street tacos are sooooo good. Had a great time. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I REALLY loved this place! We were out after midnight and i had a hankering for nachos. So we yelped nachos nearby and came across this gem. It is slightly difficult to get to this place because it seems like it is in the Miracle Mile shops, but it is actually outside and to the side. We had a tiny bit of trouble finding it. But that could just be our poor navigation skills.   Once we found our way in we were seated pretty quickly. Although the table was still dirty. They wiped it down right away and apologized. Not a big deal.   Our server was Chase who I believe is also a bartender. (I remembered his name because i have a toddler who loves Paw Patrol). Chase was fantastic! I personally cannot do tequila as it makes me sick. So i asked him besides margaritas what could i have? He told me he could make the margaritas with rum instead. I was so happy with that. I ordered the White Peach Margarita (with rum). My Hubby got the Nacho Daddy Margarita. They were big and tasted great! They each had 3 oz of alcohol.   For food we ordered the Vegas Golden Nights Nachos (Nacho Daddy). OMG! Incredible. These nachos were everything. A perfect ratio of chips to toppings. Piled with marinated filet mignon, provolone, yellow queso, sauteed onions, mushrooms, bell peppers and pickled peppers.  We added jalapenos.   I would go back to Vegas just for these Nachos. It will be very difficult to find something similar in California. Keep up the good work Nacho Daddy. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Go here! Now!!! The food uugh so good. 3 of us one had the cheeseburgers nachos they were great just like a cheeseburger. The tostada nachos were amazing. I like my food like I like my men, spicy but you might want to hold off on the jalapeños oh hawt! The BBQ nachos were tasty as all get out.   Please go. Server is so cute and so pleasant so great food, great service what??? So head over."}
{"text":"I love this place! Jovanny was a great waiter. Food was fantastic. Place is off the strip and not in a hotel so you're not dying from cigarette smoke.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"HUGE PORTIONS! The cost was about $16 for the nachos that I wanted. Our friends decided to have a few drinks in our suite and grub on some to go food so we ordered from Nacho Daddy and Hot N Juicy (located next door). I was slightly surprised that Nachos would cost so much, but realized that we are getting food on the Strip so I considered myself lucky. The staff was quick and our food was ready before we even arrived! the nachos were great paired with our drinks. The only downside I would say would be that there wasn't as much topping for the chips, but it could also have been because it was to go and not dine in. It was delicious and totally worth it none the less. Definitely recommend for anyone who loves a good nacho!!!"}
{"text":"We've been longtime customers of this restaurant, so I'm surprised that I hadn't written my review yet. We went to the Henderson one the most, but it's no longer there. We went to the Downtown one a few times when we lived on that side of town. Come to think of it, since moving here last March, we've only been to this one a couple times. (Ok, better late, than never, right?)  We selected two choices of Nachos to split between us and our boy this past Father's Day for lunch. Nacho Average Burger- ground beef, bacon, queso, red onions, tomatoes & shredded lettuce and Enchilada Nachos- chicken breast, cheese blend, refried beans, jalapenos, sour cream, & lime salsa (we opted for both the red and green sauce, split sides). Both were really yummy. We finished the Nacho Average Burger (it's our favorite!), and had some leftover of the other one, which we took home minus the chips (we had an ice block and freezer tote in the car.) The Yelp check-in offer was a house margarita, and it was yummy too. It's  a nice check-in gift!   My guilty pleasure food is Nachos and no place does it better than this place! Our bill was over $28, which was pretty good. (We got dessert once and our son had his own nachos, but this time, it was better this way; splitting two Nacho dishes.) Our son was not talking because he was too busy eating. From the size of the portions, the flavor of all of the ingredients, to the presentation, it is all good here. I think the motto here is \"no dry chips\" which is really the truth. (I'd want to try the other ones, but they might be a bit much for hubby, like the thai one or the spicy shrimp one.)      There is a small seating area in the lobby area. The counter is near the front doors. There is a bar part and restaurant seating- a mix of tables and chairs and tables/ booths (two areas, plus an outside area too). There were tv's playing soccer coverage but switched over to music videos. They sell t-shirts for $25.00. The bathroom was clean.    Service was on the slow side, but my review is on the food mainly (and for our past visits as well- keeping all of this, in mind). The server apologized for the wait, repeatedly. Our server was nice about it. I think that two parties left while we were sitting our table. There was a pretty good crowd  having lunch on Father's Day. (I am guessing more people come here for dinner rather than lunch.)"}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy gets a well deserved 4-stars. Some reviews comment in higher than average pricing. I respect this point but counterpoint the quality of food is above average.  Case in point: people in my party ordered different plates that contained what appeared to be similar pulled pork. But each plate was true to their descriptions and had distinctly different taste.  This is worth a stop if you're walking the strip and want good Mexican eats."}
{"text":"Was looking for a spot open late close to where we were staying (MGM Signature). After a quick Yelp search, found this spot. No parking lot. Located on the corner of the strip.   Inside has good music playing (hip hop)with several TV's playing sports and music videos . Table and bar / counter seating . Upstairs seating too. Appeared clean.   Hostess and waitress were friendly. A lot on the menu . A bit pricey since it's pretty much on the strip. A lot of hearty food on the menu . Breakfast served all day. Decent selection of specialty drinks .   Appetizer: spicy wings - OK, enough for two, a little burnt on outside , served with ranch and celery.   Meal : Cali Burrito - Good, filling , served with chips and salsa . Chips just mediocre , salsa is plain no authentic salsa flavor."}
{"text":"Service and food was amazing. My husband and I shared the Thai Nachos and Fish Tacos. The Thai nachos were so different and had the best flavor. We absolutely loved them! Our wait staff was very attentive and friendly. Wouldn't definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"We came here and ordered the steak and shrimp combo fajita plate.  I want to give it a 3.5 star, because the flavor was above average, but the shrimp was tiny. It sorta reminded me of the frozen mini shrimp you buy int he bag, and just defrost.   The grilled wings were actually good. They gave us the sauce on the side, so we could control how much we wanted. For grilled chicken wings, I think it was quite legit. 4.5 stars.   I did love the layout and interior of the place, especially the draft beer section where you swipe a card and get a drink. I thought that would be fun with a group of people or even as a date.   As for the nachos, I haven't tried it, and I'm not sure if I really like their method of using cheese that is melted in a pot (like velveeta) versus the real shredded cheese that's on top of nachos. So, I guess one day, I may try it, but because I'm particular about my nachos.  Service was a 5 star. I loved our server, and he was super fun to talk to. I think that was the highlight of our meal besides the good food.   I give this place a 3.25 stars for their food. Service brought it up to a 3.5."}
{"text":"First time at this place and we loved it. Dollabill was our server and he was great. We had nachos and split it between the 2 of us. The margarita was one of the best that I have had in Las Vegas. We will be going back again. The perfect place on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Great ceviche. We ordered two. The margaritas are great and huge too. Very fair pricing especially for Las Vegas! They're right by Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Jovanni is an excellent server who was very personable and friendly!!! He was so kind and acomadating!!!! I highly recommend this restaurant!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials. I really enjoyed the $20 sirloin nachos. It comes out on a big plate so it's shareable and I definitely could not finish that by myself. The chicken tacos are delicious, however their corn tortilla are a little bit soggy like it has been sitting out for a while. Other than that, great place for happy hour."}
{"text":"Stopped by Nacho Daddy's off Las Vegas Blvd and Harmon. Great atmosphere, music and the food is always good. Arnold the bartender rocks the drinks and was very helpful and attentive. These Las Vegas locals will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy was good.  We ordered the Filet Nachos.  Very yummy.  We blame ourselves, we ordered poorly.   The breakfast taco was served on  possibly the most yummy soft shelled taco I've ever tasted, however the eggs were smothered in a queso sauce... so it simply wasn't what I expected. Keep it simple, eggs and a strip of bacon would have been perfect.   My wife had the chicken taco.  The shell was the highlight, it was also very good.  Cool spot on the Strip and very good service.  Rachel took excellent care of us.  Super quick, super smiley and upbeat for dealing with many Vegas hangovers."}
{"text":"This turned out to be one the best breakfasts we have had in awhile. My wife and I had run out of ideas where to go for breakfast, looking at this place online we just didn't think it seemed like it would be a great spot but I thought Mexican for breakfast sounded good and we decided to give it a go, what a great idea. The yelp check in offer for a free margarita didn't hurt neither did the military discount. So we started our day around 830 with a margarita and some Thai Nachos. We were both very happy and the fact that so much of the menu was gluten free was awesome. You could order anything on the menu day or night. I went with the Huevos Rancheros and my wife had the Chicken and Kale Scramble. We were both glutenous and very pleased with our very full bellies."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with my 2 daughters.. They wanted to check it out.. we ordered the tostado nacho..bbq pulled pork sandwich. .fajitas sandwich and mexican burger.. the burger cooked perfect mr to med...and very tasty. ..daughters loved it.. dessert we shared fried ice cream (BOMB)!!!  Didnt get our servers name but she was awesome!! Looked after us and catered to our needs.. thank you!! Good spot and will be back again for that burger. ...."}
{"text":"Ordered the crab  & lobster nachos and it was so sweet and disgusting.. thankfully the bartender took them back ordered the nacho and cheese and not much better. It tasted like cream cheese was added.  Gave them 2 stars because of the service... however I will never go back"}
{"text":"Me and my gf were soooo excited to go to the Bellagio buffet or the Caesar's palace buffet... but they were closed at 10pm (which is insane for Vegas- the palazzo pool is open til 10pm for God's sake).  We did a quick yelp and though we weren't in the mood for Mexican food, it was Cinco de mayo... so we picked here.   Holy. Cow. Just go. If you're considering it, just go. We had Edward and Rebecca serving us at the bar-they couldn't be friendly or more attentive. Edward recommended a new menu item- Nashville Nachos. Chicken, Mac n cheese, chipotle spicy mustard sauce, hot cherry peppers, pickles, cheese... and it was the size of a cookie sheet/piled high to feed an army. My gf got the Cali burrito- Filet mignon, garlic fries, homemade salsa and chips and it was soooo delicious and filling. Just a perfect experience/atmosphere/gem.   What started as a place to \"settle\" on and eat has instantly become a Vegas staple for future trips. It's affordable, quality, and we got two free, loaded, delicious frozen house margaritas by checking in with yelp and buying an entree. The review came after our meal and free drink (just had to check in to get it)... but had to write to share how much I loved this place. Enjoy!  Try these two menu items, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Super surprised vegan options!  Grandkids wanted to go...didn't figure there would be much to eat for me and my plant based diet. Wow! A whole page on the menu of vegan options. THANKS, nacho daddy."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious !! Big plates, nice servers and really clean atmosphere I will become a regular here!!"}
{"text":"One of our usual stops when we go to vegas. Always great service, nachos and drinks are very good."}
{"text":"Too bad zero stars wasn't an option. My bf I were excited to try their nachos because of all the rave reviews. The host sat us down and told us to wait for our server. The place was dead. Several servers walked past us as we were patiently waiting to have our orders taken. 10 mins passed by until we asked our host for some service. Waited another 5 minutes and had no choice but to walk out. I can't say it was bad service. There was NO service."}
{"text":"Absolutely on of the best Mexican food places I have eaten at!! I love love nachos and Thai food, so just let me tell you I hit the jackpot with their Thai Nachos- yes I said Thai Nachos.. Thai seasoned chicken with grill onions and bell peppers and spinach corn tortilla chips and of course nacho cheese sauce. The flavor was amazing and I could eat these every day. My son had their bbq chicken nachos and he said they were really really good.  The portions were HUGE and sharing is a good idea (or you will be wasting amazing food. We will certainly be back!!!"}
{"text":"Solid experience!!! We used to frequent their Henderson location until it became a Chic Fil A .... the free house margarita for Yelp check in was a nice perk and one of the best margaritas I've ever had!!! We had the BBQ Pork Nachos and planned to order an entree as well to share but those nachos were so filling we couldn't eat another bite !!! Waiter was friendly and helpful. We were thrilled to see all the TVs had our Golden Knights game on!!"}
{"text":"First time in Vegas and this spot was amazing! Their nachos are really good and margaritas are even better!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to grab a late dinner. Sat at the bar. Didn't want anything too expensive and read the decent reviews . We had the steak nachos (split between 2 people) and they were ok. It was a large portion but Not a ton of steak considering they were $18. The salsa on the nachos tasted more like tomato sauce than salsa. Looked like the staff was still figuring everything out. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I LOVE MEXICAN food, since moving to Las Vegas it has been hard finding a regular place to go for Mexican food. I still have not found that place, but this is one of the ones I would consider going to alot. There are several locations throughout the valley. The fist time here we had great service and great food!"}
{"text":"The Golden Knights nachos were amazing and a huge portion! My husband and I split them and were very full from the deliciousness!"}
{"text":"The place is not as fancy and eye candy as other places, but the food is top quality! I ordered the lobster and crab nachos and it was really good! Normally, I'm not a big fan of cheese but the cheese in this nachos was not too cheesy. It was just right. Perfect place for just snacking or a complete meal. Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"We placed a take-out order for Four Cheese Nachos and Cheese Enchiladas with red and green sauce, since we had brought our pet on vacation and the staff said the patio was not pet-friendly over the phone. When we got back to our hotel, the top layer of nachos were sticking to the top of the container and the enchiladas were just barely warm. However, the portions and flavor were decent, so I think the experience would be better if we were to dine in. That said, I wouldn't mind returning to dine in and to try some of their desserts! Friendly hostesses, and the interior seemed to be decorated nicely."}
{"text":"Filet mignon nacho are delicious and a large portion. All you can eat chips and salsa was so good."}
{"text":"MUST GO HERE!!! Whose hungry and hungover and/or sleep deprived in Vegas?!?! My family was and thank goodness for Yelp! We decided to order for take out since the others were falling asleep....The best part was it was hot and fresh! Crunchy nacho chips, toppings were fresh, cooked to perfection and ohhhhh so good!!! We had the Filet meal mignon, lobster and crab, and fiesta nachos! FOODGASM! There's no words to describe because it was so flavorful!! Don't take my word for it, just go try it out! Don't bother trying the other usual Mexican menu items when you can have it all in the nachos!   Located on the Vegas strip in South Las Vegas Blvd near the Cosmopolitan and across the shops at crystal center. 4 stars because it was a challenge for Uber to pick up and drop off at this location. GO and TRY!"}
{"text":"Cheese!  I am one of the biggest cheese lovers you will ever meet, so of course I fell head over heels for this place.    The service is always top-notch.  Friendly, fast, and efficient.  Refills are done before you ask, timing of the meal is great, and the server checks on you regularly.    The food was fantastic.  From the Thai nachos, to the taco salad, to the street tacos, everything was fresh and tasty.  They even have desert nachos, with the flavor changing seasonally.  And try the triple dip with chips, salsa, quest and guacamole.  It was fabulous because, queso is cheese!!  We sat in the bar area to watch both a hockey game and a football game, cheering on our teams!  The atmosphere is casual and comfortable.  They also have more of a dining area for families with kids.  Parking is free and convenient, with a nice sized lot adjacent to the building."}
{"text":"The October special the Carnitas nachos were awesome and a portion of the sales go to support breast cancer awareness. Great food. Service could be better but you can tell they are still learning."}
{"text":"I'm sure most would think of this place for lunch or dinner. I must tell you.......don't leave out breakfast or their brunch on weekends. This place opens at 8:00 daily and for a good reason. On weekends they offer never ending mimosas and a make yourself Bloody Mary bar (never ending as well). Most breakfast spots have ridiculous waits on weekends. This place wasn't crowded and the food is amazing.  The menu has so many things I want to try. Definitely have to come back for other things. They have a 80oz El Jimador margarita table top dispenser for $45 too! So many unique things. Come enjoy Nacho Daddy!! Julie was a great server too!!"}
{"text":"I returned to nacho daddy prior to attending the golden knights party. I sat at the bar and all of the girls were amazing great job to Alex and Sierra for recommending the beer flight and pineapple mint margarita. Because I was headed to watch the knights game I figured I had to have the golden knights nachos, tender filet drenched in cheese sauce with peppers and mushrooms was delicious!!! There truly was not a dry chip on the plate as they like to say at Nacho Daddy. During my visit i was checked on by both managers on duty who are always extremely friendly and polite. Kudos to Edward and Joe for striving and pushing the customer service , it really showed from the moment I came through the door until I left. I'm attending game 7 if it goes that far? so I'll be returning! Maybe I'll finally take that scorpion shot!!! GO KNIGHTS!"}
{"text":"A pretty ideal late night snack. Massive portions, solid flavor and quality, tastes better when slightly (or more than slightly - hey, it's Vegas, give me a break) intoxicated. Located in Planet Hollywood, but off Las Vegas Blvd.   Did I mention the portions are huge? My appetite is far from small, but that could have satisfied at least 2 of me."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this restaurant!! The queso is beyond amazing! I also ordered the fajita steak sandwich which was delicious!! All staff from the host to the waiter to the assistant GM who came around to ask how things were superb! Great vibe & music as well!"}
{"text":"We walked to the strip from the Hard Rock. Having spent five hours in a plane, the walk was a welcome distraction. We were also starving and Nacho Daddy was the closest place to us and it was a great choice. It was breakfast time but they have a full menu all day. We had Strawberry Margaritas for breakfast. I had the Thai Chicken Nachos and they were amazing!! My friend had the Chicken Chimichanga. It was breakfast for champions!"}
{"text":"The bacon cheese enchiladas is scrumptious, it is basically an enchilada stuffed with bacon & cheese!! The huevos rancheros are delicious as well (I had the last visit)!! My husband loved the breakfast burrito, which was stuffed with egg, cheese, bacon, sausage, and hash browns!! I had a couple of the spicy cucumber margarita, great as well but could of used a lil more tequila!! Our waiter was cool, but may have been too busy check on us!! Luckily joe a new agm, came in a saved the day by showing us his superb customer service skills!! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  So good. Got the trio. The queso was life changing. Also get a free margarita for checking in. I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Awesome time eating the Filet minion nachos !!! Our server  DJ hooked us up with a table asap and made sure we were well taken care of! Thank you for the food and service DJ"}
{"text":"For Vegas I was very surprised by the food here as Mexican food is not at the top of my places to visit being from Texas but the nachos were amazing!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, it wasn't even busy! The food was alright. Server/bartender Davor B. shouldn't even be in the service industry if he can't multi task or even smile! He never checked on us and charged us for a beer that we never received. Thank you to Shawn who stopped by to refill our waters get our bill and correct it for us."}
{"text":"came here twice, sat once at the bar and our second time here was at a booth. food is great has the vegan chicken quesadilla, vegan loaded nachos, vegan chicken flaming fajitas, house margarita, and mango margarita. all great, staff is kind place plays lots of good music. it was all great im glad they have a whole vegan menu, amazing!"}
{"text":"Located on Harmon, attached to Planet Hollywood hotel Casino. As the name suggests they have all manor of nachos, as well as all manor of margaritas, Mexican food and burgers. But the real stinger (see what I did there) is you can add a scorpion to any shot! That's right kids a real scorpion! I double dog dare you! Now that the gauntlet has been thrown down, get yourself to Nacho Daddy and order a scorpion shot!!!!!! Take a picture and post it, it will impress the kids back home.  Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Located on the West side of town. I have been to there other locations and they are all great, a fun and unusual menu, all manner of nachos, and for the brave you can do a tequila shot with a scorpion in it. Yes, I did it and it was delicious! The ribs get a special mention, it has been almost a week and I am still thinking about them. I think I will, keep going back until I have tried all the versions of the nachos, and I suggest you do the same. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Jovanny was an amazing server! He was extremely helpful and the cheviche was FIRE!!! Also the check in margaritas were a cool plus :)"}
{"text":"Got the chicken fajitas.  Came nice and got.  Rice and beans were great.  Eexcellent service by a pleasant staff. My only complaint would be there is to much good food tempting me to eat to much."}
{"text":"Place was okay, but not memorable. Would recommend nachos at On the Boarder or Macayo's instead."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place from a recommendation by a bartender. Really awesome decor - music videos playing and some great tunes coming through. Place gets three stars due to it having a decent beer flight for only $9. Ordered the VGK Nachos - man are they disappointing. Small plate with Luke warm to almost cold toppings and cheese. For a place with Nacho in their title they don't do a very good job with nachos. Also ordered wings. Only two kinds...BBQ and Buffalo. No other sauces or types available. They were decent but only 8? Really. I might go back to try something else for the beer and music but avoid their so called signature dish - it's all HYPE! UPDATE!  Was contacted via email by Taylor Smith. At first she seemed genuinely concerned with the not great experience we had. But she only said \"we did get voted best wings by Insider\". Who cares??!! I'm talking to you about giving me 8 wings instead of 12 and charging me for them. They're not great!  She was not concerned with my experience and clearly is a HR/Mgmt flunkie charged with responding to reviews. She doesn't care what you say...the customer is always WRONG. Anyway, you should not order the nachos or the wings and tell the manager to stick it!"}
{"text":"I liked the nachos, the bartenders need to stick to pouring beers that they know how to pour. AKA DON'T ORDER OLD RASPUTIN HERE"}
{"text":"The margs were great and you can take them to go (hell yeah!) and you've got to get the smothered burrito with all three sauces on top. Make sure you ask for chips, queso, salsa and quac, too. You won't regret it! I was raving about this place all week while I was in Vegas - every time my friends asked where to eat I said that we should go back to Nacho Daddy."}
{"text":"Food and service was Awesomeeeee. The nachos are great if you're a nacho lover like me. The breakfast looked really good when I saw a couple order it next to me. The fries are very good(A++), and they make  a surprisingly really great hamburger. My server Korleen (if that's how you spell it) was really nice and helpful. I will positively go back when in town."}
{"text":"Free House Margarita?? Yes, please! Cheers to Yelp for this awesome checkin offer. Just an FYI you must order an entree to redeem this offer. This restaurant was on our list of places to visit!!   While on vacation with my husband and cousins, we walked over to Nacho Daddy. Lucky for us our hotel (The Elara) was on the same block.   We arrived with a party of six, there was no wait time. The service and food was great! Our food didn't take long. I ordered the chicken enchiladas with rice, of course I had my complementary Margarita. Which wasn't very strong.... but hey! It's free! So drink up! Bottom line everything was delish! The rest of the table ordered nachos, no complaints. I took some food to-go, the leftovers were even more DELISH the next day!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. The shrimp tacos were SO good. Margarita was pretty good as well. A little on the sweet side. We'll definitely come back the next time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food was actually pretty decent, and they had a great selection of vegan and vegetarian friendly items. It was fairly greasy and heavy though, but I guess it's the perfect drunk food.   The place was really pretty cool inside. They have embraced their scorpion theme with a giant scorpion terarium where you can watch them prey on little crickets, and they offer a scorpion shot that comes with a little baby scorpion in it.   Service was pretty blah. First they forgot our margaritas, then they forgot about 1/2 our order and had to come back to ask us what we wanted again. Good thing they did though because I wanted the vegan fajita bowl and they forgot it was even vegan!   Food came out and they forgot we ordered the garlic cheese fries, a side salad, no onions ina. Sandwich, and sour cream. So they had to go back and make it and bring back out.   Pretty slow service all around as well but there weren't that many people there.   would probably come back for late night drunk eats, and for the free margarita you get with a check in!"}
{"text":"Good food & service. My husband and I went on a Friday about 4:30 for happy hour. We had the Thai chicken nachos (could've been warmer, but delicious), Mexican corn on the cob, & some carne asada & chicken street tacos. We sat at a high table in the bar. The restaurant was practically empty when we got there, but was full when we left at 6:45. We were immediately seated & served our drinks. I had a skinny margarita & he had the house/happy hour wine. I ordered mine without salt, it came with salt on it, but no big deal. I drank it that way. We had to ask for happy hour menus as they were not on the table. My husband didn't think the house Cabernet was very good so he switched to margaritas as well. Overall, we both said we'd go back. It's a unique menu. The cheese sauce on the nachos is a bit processed tasting, but not overwhelmingly so. Everything we ordered was good & it was a lot of food. We split all of it. I had two margaritas, he had two margaritas & a glass of wine. Our bill was $65.00."}
{"text":"This place was near our hotel, and every time we passed by it we would crack the not your daddy joke. Then, on the last day of our trip we decided to check it out because we weren't too hungry but wanted a snack with a drink. The nachos were so delicious! We were so happy that we decided to check this place out. We ordered the carne asada and lobster and crab nachos! Both were very delicious and a huge dish to share. We also ordered the white wine sangria and it was delicious, tasted like there was no alcohol! But we were feeling it after couple drinks. Great place to grab nachos and a sweet drink!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst service in the city.  The only reason that I came in is because I had a $20 credit.  Sat at the bar and these two incompetent \"bartenders\" were pathetic.  Attempted to apply discount and all I got was attitude and eye rolling.  Then when I told them how bad the service was they both came over to me and put there breasts out on the bar and tried to get me to tip them.  Well. When that happened I actually took extra cash off the bar and walked out.  Unbelievable!!! WILL NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE AGAIN."}
{"text":"Where does one begin with a tale of such heartbreak and woe?   Pros - seated quickly, pomegranate cherry Margarita, and churro sundae.  Cons - seated next to the shrieking eels of, \"of my god, we're like totally awesome\".  My ears are ringing and bleeding. I may die of this internal injury in my sleep and those screeching college drop outs will get away with killing me.   Any who, the kids meals were so very lackluster.  The chicken tenders and fries both had an essence of aquarium rot. The mac n cheese was ok, the kids nachos came out both cold and soggy.   (Nice way to watch the goods, servers).  My chicken chimichanga was crunchy on the outside,  and a tongue scalding inferno of mostly beans on the inside.   Not much to write home about.   Well, then there was the dessert.  Churro sundae...this part they got right. I think the sound waves from the incessant shouting out of the early twenties cat ladies actually made the ice cream melt a little.   So,  after we practically swallowed the sundae whole, we waited for the check.   I couldn't shout over the stadium of three nor could I make visual contact with Ru Paul, I mean, our waiter.  After ten minutes,  and my son remarking on the steady slew of profanities from the fourth string cheer squad, the waiter magically appears,  check in hand, at their table. If I could have done it, I would've chucked my leftover bean log at him to get his attention. We literally sat for several more minutes and watched the trio jump in a fourth member by making him out-shriek and out-squeal them all,  combined. Two more minutes of feeling my ear drums expand to near bursting,  I got up from my table to leave, no check,  just leave.  Finally, the guy from Cats, off Broadway, of course, addressed me as I was going up the ramp,  with my kids.   I showed him my mean face and he said,  I have your check right here.  \"Well, thanks, glitter balls!  About effing time...\" is what I wanted to say,  but,  instead,  I thanked him for the delicious sundae, while he intermittently gave me his bitch face (and kept turning to look at his new girlfriends).  I will never be back.   FYI -  the super loud femmes were already eating their giant freaking nacho piles when we arrived, so, I never imagined those potential DUIs were going to sit and drink and scream at each other for another 45 minutes.  This may be my last review ever....unless I don't succumb to the ear injury."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. It's fun, it's happy and the food is fantastic! I am totally addicted to the potato nachos and the street tacos! They make a pretty mean Margarita as well. Can't say I'm in to eating scorpions but it sure was fun to egg on the guys and get them to do it! Scorpions in a shot of tequila...WOW! Great party place, also great place for a late night meal. Not many places open late at night that offers consistently good food. Clearly I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I almost want to knock off another star because their enchiladas were bad, but that was my fault for trying enchiladas at a place that obviously touts their nachos. I must say that this place served the best nachos I've ever experienced. It's also a lot of food and toppings! 80% of the time that I order nachos, I'm always unsatisfied with the amount of toppings supplied, but this place strikes the perfect balance of toppings to chips ratio."}
{"text":"We found this place on our last day in Vegas. The name was catchy so we figured we'd give it a try, and I'm glad we did. The nachos were well worth the stop and the michelada I had was one of the best drinks I had all weekend. The atmosphere was very chill and the waiter we had (Mark) was very nice. It was the perfect place to end our getaway. I look forward to going back on our next trip."}
{"text":"Second visit here and these nachos are the best hands down!!! Had the Filet Mignon Nachos last time and they were awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Food was decent and the wait time was minimal.  The staff was friendly and attentive, drinks were always full and plates cleared."}
{"text":"Who's your daddy? The Vegas born and raised Nacho Daddy is!! My date and I ordered the house marg (free with entree check-in offer!!) The flavor was great. Not too sweet and the tequila was mixed in well. Our entree of choice was the spicy shrimp nachos and we subbed vegan queso instead of monterey jack. House made spinach chips topped with mounds of queso, crema sauce, spicy salsa, shrimp and cilantro. The chips were a delicious twist, it was our first time trying spinach chips! We added extra hot sauce but the spicy shrimp had a kick.  The waitstaff and manager, Peter, are wonderful. Excellent customer service. Looking forward to coming back and trying more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Props to Brian for being an excellent server! Honestly - as someone who doesn't actually like queso - their housemaid queso made me a fan!"}
{"text":"Their beer battered fish tacos are some of the best I've had (and I'm from California)!   Was pleasantly surprised that a quoted 45 minute wait on a Friday, was only 25.   The service was great and will definitely come back on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Sky, Tiffany, Johnny and the Alexis serve delectable amounts of marvelous Margaritas, Nacho's and a great array of beers and tequilas in a musical smoke free environment that has us coming back weekly!"}
{"text":"Great location! This was my first time eating at Nacho Daddy and I have to admit I was a little sceptical. Why? Well I'm glad you asked, I have encounter a lot of hype about a restaurant and sometimes it does not live up to those heresy standards. But when we arrived at this location on Sahara OMG, it was clean, once you walk in some one address my party immediately then we were seated. We were asked to start off the drinks where we ask for their margaritas and Margarita was sweet OMG if you're not a drinker and you don't like the taste of liquor but you do enjoy the fun effects. I would definitely recommend one of their margaritas it was very nice very well put together not too much alcohol and not too much sugar and cocktail mix it was great. Then came the waiter who was very personable it wasn't like he was just there to do a job and you know put your food on the table. No, he offered his options he was very engaged which made us seem more relaxed and in a way at home at this location and particular restaurant we had some laughs we ordered our food the food was great appetizers were great. I would definitely recommend this place for family, a group of friends going out to eat definitely Nacho Daddy on Sahara"}
{"text":"The pigeons and birdshit hurts the otherwise great ambience. Vegan queso good. Yelp wants me to add more but not much more to add."}
{"text":"Great experience.  It was busy at lunchtime, so we ate at the bar.  Service was good.  Food was quick. Enjoyed the margaritas.  Nachos were ok, just not as gourmet as the marketing claimed."}
{"text":"What a great find on the strip! Nacho Daddy offers vegan nachos! This is amazing news for somebody with a dairy allergy that can't eat real cheese. They offer vegan nacho cheese, vegan sour cream and a ton of gluten free options! The nachos were delicious and they are fantastic at building the nachos just right so that just about every chip is covered in deliciousness. We also had a mango margarita which was tasty and strong. Our server was really knowledgable about items on the menu that would work (or wouldn't work) for our gluten and dairy allergies. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Our server, Lee, was very attentive and conversational! He was friendly and told us about different promotions and things going on with the company. The food was great and the service was also great!"}
{"text":"Nachos were soggy because they put too much stuff on them. The long Island i got was very boozy... So much that I was almost not able to enjoy it (what? ). Overall okay, but not five stars."}
{"text":"This was our first stop once we arrived in Sin City, after 4 hours drive from Palm Spings. We were starving. After a necessary Yelp search, voila!!! Nacho Daddy came up as vegan friendly.   And, let me tell you, not everything that happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas... Because this random finding on The Strip is totally worth to mention.   This mexican joint has a surprisingly good vegan menu.   I had the Loaded Vegan Nachos and were delicious and filling. They are addictive, so watch out."}
{"text":"What a bust! Just went in because yelp reviews claim vegetarian friendliness. While they have a VEGAN menu this place is the worst for vegetarians. So little help from the hostess or the bar. Nothing is marked vegetarian on the menu - tho they have an icon - and even their chips and salsa remain unmarked. So unless you're a carnivore or don't eat cheese I would avoid this place. Also service was awful. It took at least 15 mins before I could ask about vegetarian menu items... overall I'm just so disappointed...   Service: 1 star. Vegetarian friendly: less than one star.   That's all I can attest to because we left."}
{"text":"Great food and service,Resturant was very clean and had a good vibe.Food came pretty fast and hot. The only thing I would recommend is by your own margarita,I used a coupon for a free drink,It tasted like blue kool-aid and had  no type of kick to it."}
{"text":"These were the best nachos I've ever had! I swear they were made fresh to order and the spice was on point. We went here based on the name because it made us laugh. We definitely chose smartly because the food was great and the drinks were even better! I had the lobster crab nachos. People say share them, but I finished them all myself! muahahaha"}
{"text":"I have to say, everything the good reviews say are true about Nacho Daddy! Friendly, fast service, delicious food served hot and fresh, and a casual, fun ambience.   My order was lobster crab tacos (I subbed corn tortillas for flour) and the Supreme Tostada Nachos. Whatever sauce they put on those tacos, I wish I could take a jar of it home! The seafood was well done too. And the nachos were pretty darn tasty. Their homemade tortilla chips are perfect and the queso they use, yummmm! The Asst. GM stopped by my table to make sure everything was good, which always makes me smile   Although the location is slightest off the strip, it's easy to find. Just look for Buffalo Wild Wings next door. My advice to anyone considering visiting the Taco Bell Cantina (just a few doors down) is to swing the extra cost and step outside of the fast food box - and check this place out!!"}
{"text":"The new guy, that's what he told us, Damond or DJ killed it...he was great and the new bartender Booker was great as well...A+ for this place."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get some late night food with some friends or coworkers! It's convenient for my coworkers and I since we don't get off of work till 12am most nights so it's the perfect place for us! Their filet mignon nachos has got to be the best ever"}
{"text":"On paper this is a grand concept, especially to someone like myself that loves nachos so much. This one is in an odd location just off the strip, but is worth finding if you want some nachos while watching some sports. There is a lot of indoor seating and some outdoor as well. They have a lot of televisions through out.  We started with an order of the Queso Dip. It is a good sized portion and was a nice way to start the meal. In hind sight we likely did not need an appetizer but we were happy with it none the less. For the meal we ordered the Nacho Average Burger Nacho. I liked the idea of going a little off the grid for my selection. All the normal parts of a burger, less the bun, on a bed of chips. It was interesting, but tasty. I enjoyed it. The portion was massive. You can easily share them with multiple friends.  This is a good casual spot to load up on bar food and watch the game. It is pretty affordable too."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late night dinner food was good if you go during the busy hours order online"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited 20 minutes and nobody came by. Left and asked to speak to the manager and nobody could point out who that was. Never going back to this location. Fucking horrendous"}
{"text":"Aly gave us great service and was on it the entire time. Great food and great drinks. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for Mexican breakfast! Awesome margaritas and the nachos are sooo good. Now give me my free margarita!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Nacho Daddy while in Vegas. Being vegan there are not many options on the strip and this place had an entire section of yumminess! I will be back for sure!! The chick'n quesadilla was awesome!"}
{"text":"Davor for the win!!! He was our server tonight and was crazy kind to us. Between the questions, suggestions, the entertainment value... great stuff.   We came in for a margarita and food. I personally ordered the Daddy's bowl because I'm feeling \"daddy\" vibes right now with all this responsibility in my life lol. I ordered it without spice or cilantro and the bowl was amazing. And filling. I still have enough for a whole lunch tomorrow and that's hard to beat.   The night ended with deep fried ice cream and it was like Cinnamon Toast Crunch had a baby with ice cream to create magic. I ate magic tonight, ya'll.   Come check this place out."}
{"text":"Just ate a full plate of the VGK Nachos and they were amazing! I don't usually do nachos but I crushed these. The flavours were amazing and the filet was perfectly cooked. The Daddy's Margarita is must have as well. Will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Our first time eating Here The Food Was OK. But the service was amazing my server dolla. Bill was super busy and still managed to give excellent service with a smile and positive attitude!!  Everyone made a great team working together which is rare in the f&b industry."}
{"text":"It was one of the best nachos ever! We got the Vegas knight nachos big enough to share.  Get the Scorpion shot! everyone will think that you're brave"}
{"text":"A must try in Vegas.  The jalapeno and cucumber margarita is awesome!  I enjoyed the surf and turf tacos as well.   My server Ariana was the best and thank you Peter for the hospitality!"}
{"text":"As a nacho snob, I was SO excited to check out Nacho Daddy while I was in Vegas. I am very picky about my nachos and it is very hard for me to find what I call true nachos. Nothing bugs me more than restaurants calling a huge pile of chips with a few toppings thrown on it \"nachos\". That is most definitely not the case at Nacho Daddy.  I went with the Supreme Tostado Nachos after much debate. They have so many options it's hard to choose. They laid the most beautiful plate of nachos I've ever seen in front of me and I was instantly in love. The chip to topping ratio was on point. It wasn't a heaping pile of chips with a few toppings. It was even better once I ate it! So much flavor and so many toppings! So many toppings that it was near impossible to eat these without a fork.   All other restaurants should take a lesson from Nacho Daddy and learn what true nachos should be like!"}
{"text":"Horrible food, fake cheese, frozen shrimp, and stale tortillas. Don't waste your time with this one."}
{"text":"Our server Ryan was the highlight of our dinner experience! The food and drinks were great as well. We will definitely visit again the next time we're in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"It was Late and I was a little buzzed but the nachos were GREAT. .. Has several different types and both were supper Good.  Service was fast and friendly but not alot of people there so not sure how they do when it's packed. Next time I'm in town will definitely eat there again.."}
{"text":"Honestly, the best nachos I've ever had. My husband and I came for lunch while we were killing time yesterday waiting to head to the airport for our flight. We decided that a place called \"Nacho Daddy\" was too good to pass up.   It's a little strangely located, on the outside of the Miracle Mile shops, around the corner from the main drag. You can only get to it from the outside, not from inside the mall. We didn't have a problem finding it, but the location did surprise us.   We were promptly seated. I was quite frankly a little shocked to see that the windows and doors were propped open despite it being 100 degrees outside, but the air inside was kept refreshing and cool. Unlike a lot of places in Vegas, I wasn't shivering from the blasting AC, and I wasn't sweating through my clothes from stale air. It was literally perfect.  As for the food, it was AWESOME. We ordered two things of nachos, the BBQ Chicken and the Nacho Hamburger Nachos. True to their slogan, there was not a single dry nacho. The flavors were really unique and enjoyable, but both my husband and I preferred the flavor of the Nacho Hamburger Nachos. Two plates of nachos was a lot of food for the two of us. We were able to finish it, but were feeling pretty full and a little bloated for several hours afterwards.  I also ordered the tortilla soup which was really delicious, and I added a side of avocado to it which was perfectly ripe and a great addition.   We also had a lot of fun watching the music videos that were playing from the 2000s on the televisions around the restaurant! That's a fun idea."}
{"text":"I went to a Yelp Elite Event at Nacho Daddy years ago, when they opened their first location in Henderson, which is now closed. More recently, a superb YEE at their Strip location made me want to try the branch on Sahara, closer to home.  I didn't check in on Yelp until I ordered a glass of wine, so I've saved my free Margarita with check-in until next time. There WILL be a next time.  Nacho Daddy's is famous for their nachos (duh), all kinds of nachos, but we weren't feeling them tonight.  Instead, I ordered a Fajita bowl, hold the tortilla shell. It was full of chicken, black beans, peppers, and onions, and I was gratified that there was a choice of rice or quinoa. I love quinoa! I was sure that the menu had said it was supposed to come with shredded lettuce. Our waitress said it didn't, but offered to check the menu.  She returned with a bowl of shredded lettuce, because yes, it was supposed to be there.  It also had a dollop of guacamole, which it was NOT supposed to be included. I sure didn't complain about it being there. I didn't even complain about the lettuce. Nevertheless, the manager, Flo, came over and said that because the kitchen messed up, she was taking it off the bill. Huh? I didn't ask for that, didn't make a scene about the missing lettuce, even told the waitress how grateful I was for the guac, and still, they comped the salad? Now that's customer service, capital CS.  My husband started with a bowl of tortilla soup, flavorful and slightly creamy. The Laws of Mexican Gastronomy says that it should come with avocado; it's an upcharge here. But he had enough sliced avocado in his Mexi-Cobb Salad, which was served a bit before he finished the soup, to add some.  It also had romaine tossed with an onion thyme vinaigrette, and topped with marinated chicken strips, pico de gallo, cheese, corn, cucumbers, and tortilla strips. He loved it.  Coming here a mere two days after our disastrous Thanksgiving meal at an upscale restaurant, I couldn't help comparing the experiences, apples and oranges though they may be. If Nacho Daddy is the apple, I'll take a bite of that any time. It was delightful, and we look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Feb 28, 2018 was my first time trying Nacho Daddy. And honestly the only reason why they caught my eye is due to the fact that there is a vegan menu! That made me so happy. Hopefully more estashblishments will get with the program. Anyway, I ordered the loaded vegan nachos and let me just tell you I loved every bit! Those were absolutely the best nachos I've had....EVER!"}
{"text":"Food: I ordered the Lobster Crab enchiladas, and they were OK. My guess is Nacho Daddy is known for their Nachos, so get the Nachos!  Atmosphere: I sat at the bar, got a 25oz IPA, watched part of a football game on one of the many TV's. Pretty good music playing. Not very crowded for a Saturday night.  Service: Everyone was great, always asking if I needed anything.   Tip: Decent food, good selection of drinks, and Yelp has a deal for Margaritas, but I drink beer!"}
{"text":"I love Nacho Daddy but I wish their fish and chip ( I substituted for rice) meal was bigger. They give you all the wonderful lemony sauce but not enough fish to dip in there. I've only been here twice but every time I go I can't say no to the elote. Elote is corn smothered in mayo, Mexican cheese, lemon and spiciness. It sounds like a weird combo but I love it!   The servers are always awesome and they come by to make sure you are doing well. We came in with a mailer that the server had never seen instead of brushing us off he had the manager go ahead and fix the bill to honor the mailer.   I also like the idea when we were seated music videos were on that I haven't seen in a while like MC Hammer Can't touch this. I personally prefer music videos over sports any day! I would like to come during brunch and try their Bloody Marys soon!"}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy is a welcomed find on the Las Vegas strip.  The male  bartender was a bit of a jerk when we first arrived but after we were seated the food and everything else made up for it.  Jacob our server was great!  Attentive, knowledgeable about the menu and took good  care of us, just a super guy. My table had flaming fajitas, pork nachos and vegan nachos and all were excellent!  We ended our meal with a delicious vegan chocolate cake.    We sat in the back right by the open kitchen and it was nice to see such a happy group getting along so well.      Next time I'm in Vegas I'll be back."}
{"text":"Jovany was awesome!!! Great place for a bachelorette! The scorpion shots are so great!"}
{"text":"I am in Vegas visiting family from San Diego. I came into nacho daddy this evening by suggestion of close friend who lives here. With big eyes and an empty stomach I was ready to grub on some, what I've heard, amazing gourmet nachos. I walked into Nacho Daddy, which had some sort of trivia game happening, the servers looked very busy, and the bar was pretty full, but the restaurant didn't seem very busy at all. I stood at the host stand for 10 min without any one approaching me and my boyfriend. We decided for a restaurant that isn't insanely busy it was obvious their careless hostess didn't want our business so we decided to leave. On the other hand I would suggest going to the Italian restaurant next door, which was extremely attentive from the moment we walked through the door."}
{"text":"We had the peach and house margarita.  Both were super tasty! The star of the night were the local vegan nachos which even my carnivore boyfriend enjoyed."}
{"text":"Nacho daddy is one of my favorite Vegas eats. The service is always awesome and the food is to die for.  On tuesdays, they have a deal on the tacos which are phenomenal. I get the chicken tacos and dip them in queso - another awesome thing on the menu.  I recommend the queso dip as an app as well.  I usually get the Buffalo Nachos. They never get old and I eat them at least once a week! They're the right amount of spicy, too. They're quite large and there also on the happy hour menu.   I recommend everyone getting the margarita you get for free when you check in. Their margaritas are so yummy and they're pretty potent . I recommend this place to anyone looking for a cool, kick ass local place."}
{"text":"Restaurant is fabulous, cozy, comfortable... Service is exceptional, quick, informative, friendly.... Food is FABULOUS!!! The Grilled Mexican Corn on the Cob is delicious. We also tried the Tre Street Tacos. One each, chicken, pork, and shrimp. The tacos were very tasty... my fav was the pork... very juicy and flavorful. My least fav was the chicken.... a tad dry.. I added the hot salsa that the waiter brought on the side and it helped kick them up a notch.  The star of the lunch.... Carne Asada Nachos..... duh.... it is called Nacho Daddy!! They were perfect!!! Really one of the best nachos I have ever had! I saw on yelp some people were upset at the prices??? First of all, good food is worth a few extra dollars!! But our bill for all of the above was $34....... It was plenty of food to fill up me and my husband and we left HAPPY!!!  And... They have a very extensive menu... not just nachos. Burgers, Chicken Wings, Vegan dishes... (the Daddy's Big Burrito caught my eye for my next visit for sure)"}
{"text":"Sat for over 10 min and our server never showed up. Had to ask for her and she was ill prepared. How does a restaurant not have sprite or 7up to drink or lemonade? Do they expect you to just drink alcohol? WTH?!"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed! We had to go to Vegas due to the fires in So Cal. And stayed with family right near by so we thought why not? However it was such a complete bust. And way too expensive! No complentry chips and salsa. No fruit at all as a side dish for kids meals. My son was so upset at that and my kids wanted deep fried ice cream and the waitress said they had no more. But when we asked the hostess she said they did. Then waitress came back and said pretty rudely, remember I told you we don't have that. So I politely asked then for the Charro with ice cream. To my surprise they had that. How in the world do they have ice cream for that but not for deep fried ice cream? How does that make since. Food for 3 kids, (I did not order anything seeing how expensive it was for the quality of food) I just ordered food for my kids and for 2 kids meals and 1 thing of nachos and 1 desert was $60!! That's GD ridiculous!!! So upset. And it was the ONE and only time we went out to eat while we were there and it was a total bust!! I highly recommend NOT going there at all!! Wish it could have been different especially since we had just to flee our home due to being evacuated and I wanted my kids to enjoy themselves and get there mind of things are they were not even happy with how the food tasted. Ugh.. $60 down the damn toilet!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Enchilada nachos are seriously amazing. Server- Jovanny - was attentive and friendly. Our overall experience was awesome!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Judy was our server and she nailed it with her recommendations! We're trying to figure out how to make it happen that we can come back here one more time before we leave tomorrow.  I ordered the Filet nachos and the Peach margarita. The filet is so tender and flavorful. It's the only time I've actually enjoyed the steak on a steak nacho. The peach marg was the perfect sweetness.. not too much, not too little. Is it wrong to come back to Vegas for Nacho Daddy? I don't think so! #JudyRocks #NachoDaddyFanForLife"}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better service!! When our food came out extra spicy, they/Christina didn't hesitate to get us a new plate with the sauce on the side.  The atmosphere is awesome! Always showing good Sporting events and/or music videos.  I've eaten here multiple times and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We ordered to-go, because there was an hour wait for a table. We split an order of the spicy shrimp nachos. The flavour was packin', but the contents were a bit basic; my bad, I should have read the menu description a lil' closer.  The hostess was really helpful and friendly. The  bathroom inside was trashed, but the ambiance  in the restaurant was cool."}
{"text":"I can easily say this was my favorite spot in Vegas this trip. Daria was our waitress, and really made us feel welcome. I shared the BBQ Pork Nacho with my husband, and we also got the house margaritas and Arnold Palmer's. Everything was perfect, and the food was out very quickly.   I wondered if one could feed both of us hungry people, and it totally did.  We sat and watched the Kentucky Derby on the huge TV's inside. What a fun spot.  For the price and location the food was incredible. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had the filet mignon nachos and they did not disappoint! They were delicious and the portion size was huge! We also ordered the naked wings which were delicious too especially since they tasted grilled rather than fried (I didn't confirm the cooking method).  This spot is open late which is great if you're looking for a late-night snack after a long day in Vegas. Will definitely be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Free house margarita with the yelp check in! Very customizable menu. As a vegetarian it has a great selection. Good music. And we had the best server. His name was Dj.  He sat with us and talked about places to visit. Will for sure come back and have that dance battle."}
{"text":"I've never been here before but noticed they had a lot of vegan options. A friend and I tried it out and the food was insanely good. The service on the other hand was terrible. I watched every table voicing the same complaints to the waiters and managers. Food took forever and normal service items were not tended to. It was busy and we noticed the poor waiter was slammed and trying to keep up. We were patient, gave him a big tip and thanked him. I went home and shared with my family about the food so they wanted to go there for lunch today. Most of them are not vegan so it was a good place for everyone. The restaurant was slow and we had the same exact service. The food took an hour to get out, the waitress was sat tables in all areas of the restaurant which she couldn't keep up with. The place has good food but they need to work out their service issues."}
{"text":"Edward De La Rosa, the assistant general manager, helped me and my girl out tonight while we were at the bar. He was so nice and professional, not to mention informative about the menu! He even made our drinks! It's awesome to see a manager so involved with the overall operations of the restaurant and the customers! He's fantastic and we will definitely seek him out the next time we go to Nacho Daddy!!! Thanks Edward for making our experience extra enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Whenever I come to Vegas, this will definitely be a place I will eat at.  There is something for everyone on this menu...even plenty of vegan options.  There was a 20 minute wait if we wanted to sit at a table, but immediate seating if we sat at the bar, which we took advantage of.  Ordered the spicy shrimp nachos...AMAZING!  Our friend ordered the bbq chicken nachos and those looked just as amazing...and I'm a pescatarian!  The waitstaff was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome Happy Hour Specials!!!  Great place to eat to hold you over till dinner.  The Sloppy Jose Nachos were killer."}
{"text":"Best deal on the strip, well technically around the corner but well worth the very short walk.  More choices and lower prices than the competition and I think the food is as good or better."}
{"text":"Who is your daddy?? Or as my 5 year old would say, What kind of cheese isn't yours?? Nacho cheese....How about both of those words into one for a great name....NACHO DADDY!   I have a challenge to eat at 24 new places in 2017. This was #11.   OVERALL RATING: 5 (SCORED 24 OUT OF 25) STAFF: 5 (All very friendly and enjoy working) FOOD: 5 SERVICE: 5 (Multiple people working on your table, not just one waiter/waitress) CLEANNESS: 5 PRICE: 4  Everyone has to love Nacho's...so what a better place to go to than a place called Nacho Daddy while in Las Vegas.   The address is Las Vegas Blvd, but it is on the front of a side street. Not far from the strip.   A lot of ingredients and mixers for drinks are all made in house! Which means better and fresh flavors.   Make sure to check in on Yelp while there and you get a FREE margarita. Not a cheap, piss pour one either. It was the same as the one we paid for! Had great flavor, mixed well too.   STAFF: Everyone was very friendly. The waiter spent time with us and the menu. Not once did they try to rush us and get us out of the place.   FOOD: Lots and Lots of it. Nachos can be split with a few people they are that big. However, since I was bowling nationals that day, I wasn't going to be eating much and ate it all to myself. Yes, I am a pig I know. Lots of flavor, not over whelming though. I had the crab and lobster nachos. I would def. order them again when I go back.   SERVICE: OUTSTANDING. Everyone was very attentive and helpful. Not once did we hear I am sorry you are not my table. Everyone asked if we needed anything else, etc.   CLEANNESS: Tables cleaned while you are sitting at them. Never a mess left at a table once people are gone. Food was picked up off the floor, which is a good thing because we know how messy nachos can be.   PRICE: You might look and think it is expensive...however, the size of the platter that the nachos come out on is HUGE and with lots of ingredients.   If you are in Vegas, this is a must mid day snack stop!"}
{"text":"So first impressions: Vegan food has an actual menu! Most vegan options are pretty limited on the strip, but they have chick'n \"meat\" and the flavors are very well done. Looking for vegan options on the strip was limiting me to Wahlburgers for the impossible burger and fries. So when I saw this menu? I was in!   We ordered the chicken fajita platter and the special chick'n chimichanga. Both were vegan, although my dinner date didn't care for the black beans or wild rice. The flavored were good, and the unlimited chips and salsa have a good flavor. I liked their guacamole, it was really fresh and well flavored. I don't think the beans and rice were terrible enough to knock off a star, and the service was good, but a little slow. I liked the flavors, and the food was plated nicely and had good portions. I didn't the nachos, but they looked PHENOMENAL. Next time it's nacho time!   Entrees were about $15, and a small appetizer with two waters made it a big meal. Overall, $45 with a 20% tip for two wasn't bad at all."}
{"text":"Had the chips and salsa and avocado tacos with the avocado not fried. Was AMAZING!!!! Wasn't super expecting it to be good tbh but the salsa was really good and the tacos were perfection. Pretty large vegan menu for not being a vegan place. Next time I plan on trying the nachos. Was so glad I found this place! Vibe was cool and the staff was very friendly and on point with their service"}
{"text":"First time here after finding all my usual Vegas taco spots had bit the dust...gotta say, this place is pretty sweet!  Seemed more like a chain establishment---and very well could be--but it was a very chill spot to just hang out and have drinks.  Lucky first us, we arrived during happy hour so we got some deals as far as tacos and nachos.  Tacos on special were all street taco style--pretty good, though my favorite ended up being a nacho dish with hamburger meat.  Definitely will be back to chill here the next time im in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I just ordered 80 dollars worth of food for delivery, and it was horrible. First, let's start with the filet mignon nachos, besides it looking like Taco Bell, wait sorry Taco Bell was better. So I wanted sour cream on my nachos, nope none on there. It looked like they just threw everything on top and nothing in the middle. Then one of the burgers I ordered was supposed to come with no cheese. Nope we got the cheese. I also ordered crab and lobster enchiladas, which came with extra shell to give it that extra crunch. Yummy!! Yes I'm being a smart butt, but when you pay $80 for some dinner and it looks and taste like hell. Yeah, I'm going to leave a review."}
{"text":"This is the third Nacho Daddy location I've been to now and probably my second in choice. It's located right outside Planet Hollywood on Harmon Ave. This one is definitely a lot bigger than the downtown spot & has some pretty cool, trendy decorations.  Service wise I could tell some kinks still needed to be worked out like having a hostess up front and ready to greet people. My friend and I ended up sitting at the bar during visit so our bartender was great. She was super friendly and quick.   As for the food they have various options like enchiladas, tacos, salads and obviously nachos. They have a decent handful of vegan and vegetarian options which is awesome. I had the loaded nachos this most recent time which were quite tasty. The only downside for me was that the chips get soggy too quickly.   Overall I'd come back to this location again if I'm around the strip and would recommend it for others visiting to check it out."}
{"text":"Maybe I should have stuck with what they're known for, but this place was just super disappointing. My friends and I came here last night on cinco de mayo. The service was pretty slow and our waitress forgot all about the shots we had ordered, but this review is based solely on the food since I can't really knock service too much on the busiest day of the year.  We ordered the chips and salsa to start. The flavor was decent, but nothing outstanding or noteworthy. I wish the chips would have tasted a bit more fresh. For a main dish I went with the grilled fish street tacos. I enjoyed the diced mango on top as a somewhat unique flavor, but overall the tacos were just super bland and dry. Very disappointing for a $9.50 price point. The only good part about my meal was the free house margarita with my yelp check in.  I'd probably still come back here again to try the nachos since that's mainly what they're known for, but I wouldn't recommend ordering anything else on their menu."}
{"text":"Yasssss! This place is amazing. Not only is the food delicious but the specials are amazing. it was bit hard to find as I was circling the Miracle Mile mall trying to find this place but then realized that it was outside. A man was handing out coupons for free margaritas with an order of an entree....SCORE! My ultimate goal was to try to the seafood nachos but I decided to go with the carne asada tacos as I didn't want to seem like a complete hog. The tacos were amazing and very flavorful. The bartender was a complete sweetheart and made sure I was taken care of. I'm coming back to Vegas in April and ND will definitely be on my list."}
{"text":"Great service, and really good food. If you're looking for  inexpensive Tex-mex this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Listen, these nachos are to die for. I love Mexican food, and my favorite thing to order is nachos. Finding a place that has so many choices of nachos to order was like heaven. My man and I ordered the same thing, but we should've just ordered one because there was so much food!! We could not finish our plates. Overall, the food is great, and the drinks are pretty good as well!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with my nachos, they were really chips with a little melted cheese. My chicken burrito was great"}
{"text":"TBH the name drew me to this place, but after looking at all the reviews I knew I had to stop in!   First off, don't forget to check in for a FREE Signature Margarita! Can't go wrong with that, had a good amount of alcohol and was a great way to start the meal. The ambiance is perfect for groups with plenty of tv screens playing either sports or throwback hip hop songs. Now onto the food:   Filet Mignon Nachos - SO GOOD! The meat is very tender and everything about the taste was perfect. The only thing I would fix is maybe adding more chips since those ran out real quick and the portion size isn't the largest I've seen, but it's definitely quality over quantity here.   Thai Chicken Nachos - made with spinach chips, these were definitely not your average nachos. Wasn't a huge fan of these since the chicken was cut a bit larger so it was a bit harder to scoop.   Peach Margarita - got a pitcher of this and it poured 5 cups easily. Absolutely loved it and would recommend it to others.   Overall, I'd make another stop here the next time I'm in Vegas with some friends. The service was great, ambiance was chill, and paired with some delicious nachos means you're in for a good time."}
{"text":"Nachos says it all but what I loved is they has an entire vegan section- including vegan nachos- which were amazing! With a dairy allergy I haven't had nachos in a long time so it was an awesome treat. Great service - fun atmosphere- no wait. I'll come back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had fun went here late after night for some awesome Mexican food! Would come back again!"}
{"text":"Transients passing through Vegas...  needed some food to power us through the hangover into ARizona.  Our fearless leader found Nacho Daddy (love the name) and in we went.  There were four of us, I LOVED my chilaquile - the other 3 were not so enchanted.   In defense of Nache Daddy (in the light of my companions' \"meh\" assessment):  WHY in the name of God would you order kale & chicken stirfry or a \"grilled chicken sandwich\" in Vegas? I mean, do you go to the Szechuan province to get \"THE best\" chimichurri sauce?  Or to Seoul for the BEST Tikka Masala?  Do NOT blame Nacho Daddy for your imprudent decisions!    (BRIEF summary:  get the chilaquile for breakfast.  Delicious.)"}
{"text":"So good! Especially after a long night of drinks and partying. It really hit the spot. And the michelada that I didn't take a picture of ()because it was so good I couldn't stop drinking.... I want another one right now. Mmmm.  We were walking by and decided to take a chance on this place and so glad we did! The nachos were good and the ceviche was fresh. It all took a little long to come out but it was worth it. The bartender was super nice. She was busy but when she'd come and talk to us she was totally attentive.  My bf also had a scorpion shot. With an actual scorpion in it!!  with tequila. He said it didn't taste like anything but I'll just take his word for it because I wasn't brave enough to try it. I had the enchilada nachos and he had the ones that were like a tostada. With so many amazing places in Vegas, I was not disappointed to try this one."}
{"text":"Good food on the strip. It did take me a while to find it. The entrance is not in the mall but on the street.  Remember to CHECK-IN for the FREE margarita which covers the most basic option. And you can choose to upgrade and pay the difference.   The nacho is a must try. I got the filet nacho and they are good amazing!! Fajita is another must try. Get the for two versions.  I don think it"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. Drunk gal kept reaching over and taking food from our plate. Bartender's response to this is to give her a free bowl of nachos. Got the bill and handed it to the gal who ate half our food. Then she gets all loud and offended. I ask for the manager. It took well over 5 minutes for a guy named Nick to come out since apparently he had left the building. I try to explain the situation to him while the bartender is repeatedly whining that he didn't do anything wrong. Nick offers no adjustment on our bill nor anything else to make us think the place cares about making the customer happy. I tell him I plan to tell everyone I know not to go here, but I think others have beaten me to it since it was pretty empty for a Friday night. The food is unremarkable, forgettable, and overpriced. Fancy serving trays just don't improve the taste. Not to worry, the drunk gal was hiding in the corner of the parking lot and on her way back in once she saw we were leaving."}
{"text":"I mean this place used to be good idk what happened. Every time I have been here I have never gotten the same server twice. There always seems to be new staff. But this last time was the worst it has ever been. I ordered the vegan chicken chimichanga ( for 15.00$) when it came out it was sitting in a pool of oil when I cut it open there was pieces of steak also mixed In which I had to pick out took one bite and it just tasted like the fry oil. So I pushed it away and waited for the server to come back and when she did all she asked was if I wanted the plate taken away I said yes and was going to tell her about the steak and how awful the food was but she was gone too quickly and never even came back except to drop off the check. No one ever even asked how the food was or why when the server took a full plate of food there was no questions on why nothing was eaten from it. I was so irritated with the whole situation that I didn't want to argue because I would not have said anything nice so I just paid and left.  But that's what I get for not ordering nachos at a nacho place"}
{"text":"My first encounter with Nacho Daddy was late at night, when I had a little fun and found myself ravenous. I ordered the vegan loaded nachos and had them delivered to my hotel. In 30 min, I had a pile of perfectly gooey nachos at my disposal. Their vegan nacho cheese is legit!!! This is not a couple of daiya shreds thrown about, this is cheeeeeese, on every single chip. They loaded them up right, with smoky, spicy salsa and beans. They were so good, my cheese-hating (vegan or otherwise) husband dived right in with me. Thank god, too, because there were a ton of nachos!  My second encounter was when I stumbled upon their storefront just when I was feeling hungry. I saddled up to the bar and was served by Scarlett, who was super sweet and made me feel right at home. It's hard eating alone anywhere, but in Vegas it can feel especially isolating. I felt right at ease with my complimentary margarita (free when you check in!), chick'n tacos, and vintage Kelly Clarkson.  I love that this chill place has lots of vegan options, delivery, and multiple locations across Vegas. I don't love the tank of scorpions, and how they dare you to take a scorpion shot. Eek! Creepy and unkind, not a great mix. The nachos are fantastic, though, and I look forward to coming back after a fun night on the town."}
{"text":"We came here for date night and we were not disappointed. After looking over the menu, we decieded to go big and order three types of nachos (our server even warned us about the amount) and margaritas. Very good nachos and I love the different varieties you can choose from. We ordered the Florentine, average burger and pulled pork. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I love the vegan food here, all of it is good. Try the fried avocado tacos-bartender casy"}
{"text":"My favorite place for nachos everrrrr.. Recommend to family and friends.. customer service is awesome as well"}
{"text":"If you had a few drinks the night before and need a good breakfast for another afternoon/night of drinking this is the place to be! First of all they serve you a french press of coffee, which means it's strong as hell and wakes you up! There are no free refills of the french press, but you are able to share it between two people with a cup and a half between the two of you. Trust me it's all you need. The breakfast menu is limited, but it covers the basics from breakfast burritos to breakfast sandwiches. When we got there the service was a little slow for anyone to come to us and that's only because the bartender was around the corner of the bar making two bloody mary masterpieces for two other guests at the bar. They looked delicious (if I liked tomato juice I would get one). They are probably the only restaurant that still does bottomless mimosa's!!!!   The food was tasty and surprisingly light for being so much of it. They use fresh ingredients so that makes all the difference. We can't wait to go here for Nachos and margaritas one night!"}
{"text":"I wish I remembered our server name! She was so warm and welcoming.. Had a sleeve tattoo and was amazing with accommodating our noisy 1 year old and sleeping 2 year old! As a mother with her hands full its always super helpful with all the help I can get. As great as our service was, I am a huge Mexican food lover that wish I could say the same about the food. I would say its pretty average on the taste buds! Not that its bad or anything but if you want authentic nachos just know this place has a good variety in choices but is for your american audience. None the less, I would return because the happy hour wasnt bad at all plus a free house margirta on the first check in! A little limey but hey it was free!"}
{"text":"It's not my nature to complain but our experience was really bad. Food without a doubt good. We sample several items and all were tasty. So the one star goes for the following:  * no plates available * mimosas took forever (food arrived before them) * manager would not come over to our table (ignored us) * everything was \"backed up\""}
{"text":"Always a go to place to eat!!!! Great service, food comes quick, and amazing food. Lots of TVs to watch the Knights win!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by because the vegan nachos were recommended ..was excited when it didn't taste like spoiled cardboard lol our server Lee was very helpful and patient with all our curious questions."}
{"text":"Nacho average Mexican food! But I must say Nacho Daddy is my new go to Mexican place on the Strip! Great drinks and food. But service is where they really hit it out of the park. Mark E. the manager is a great, hospitable host!"}
{"text":"Great nachos- so many choices!! We all tried a different kind and shared. The BBQ pork were fantastic. The filet minot were ok not much meat. Also enjoyed the sloppy Jose and the buffalo chicken- recommend this spot! Service was excellent too."}
{"text":"Super cool place to eat!  Jovanny was very helpful and great with service! Recommend stopping here for a bite if you are into nachos!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with our family in for the holidays last friday. Another great experience here. Food, service were super  and atmosphere really fun. Friendly staff always makes you feel appreciated."}
{"text":"This would get a better rating if the service wasn't awful! For a party of 2 on a Saturday evening around 6 we were seated quickly. HOWEVER, my mother and I waited 10 mins only for the sister to say he will be right with us as he needs to take drinks to another table yet he wasn't carrying any drinks. Then it took about 15-20 mins just to order our drinks at that point we knew what we wanted to eat. We ordered and the food came out efficiently. The food was decent don't get me wrong it wasn't bad. But the service was terrible! Upon our food arriving the waiter checked in on us after about 15 mins and I asked for a side of sour cream it took him another 10 mins to ask if we were okay and didn't bring our sour cream side. Once we finished our meal it took him another 10-15 mins to get our check and pay. I am absolutely shocked at the quality of service for the amount of people eating there. There was less than 15 people eating there and the service was as if they had a full house!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here once before.  Service is great, margaritas tasty, sizzling shrimp app and filet mignon nachos both delicious.  Will definitely be coming back when in town."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did.   Pros:  Prompt service Good margaritas Friendly atmosphere  Con's: Noisy kids Sub par nachos Price  My nachos were just okay. They were chicken nachos and it was a constant scavenger hunt trying to locate meat. They should've been called 'bean nachos with a chicken surprise'. My date ordered some beef nachos, and this is where the 2 stars come in, his were great! Very flavorful with just the right amount of spice. The margaritas we ordered were very strong and a little sweet which made them perfect. At $60 for 3 drinks and 2 sets of nachos, definitely not worth it. I actually felt like Roberto's food had more flavor and I hate them."}
{"text":"This place was very tasty. Only bummer was that our waitress was so insanely slow. We were in the restaurant starving for 25 minutes until we finally got to order. Then it was impossible to hunt her down for utensils and the check. We got the bbq chicken nachos, yum. And I personally got the fajita salad, this was good too and I liked the dressing."}
{"text":"This was our second attempt at Nacho Daddy. I looooove the green sauce on the enchiladas. I also tried a chicken burrito. However, this place's water tastes WEIRD. Like old or stale?  The service was good, the Mexican corn appetizer was good too!   I just don't know if it impressed us enough. There are a lot of amazing Mexican places in  Vegas. If you're interested, I'd recommend just trying it out for yourself."}
{"text":"The setting is awesome. Lots of TVs for sports viewing. Extensive beer selection and great tasting food. The service was excellent, especially since we were here on Super Bowl Sunday, and it was busy. Highly recommend this place for family, couples, or singles. There's a separate room with a large TV where a group outing would be perfect."}
{"text":"Free maragarita with checkin, perfect after a long day.  I'm only visiting for a week and have been here twice now because the nachos are so freakin huge and delicious.  Highly recommended.  A little pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  Davor was our server and he was fabulous!  $1 coronitas at Happy Hour!  Wow!  We ordered 3 different nacho plates to give them a try and we are hooked!  If you haven't tried this place yet - get there!"}
{"text":"The staff was awesome here! Very friendly and helpful! Got a great plate of nachos i couldn't get anywhere. Jovany, my server was prompt but, not hovering. He made my meal a great experience. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great staff, huge tv screen for sports, and good food. They seemed really busy and apologized for the backup but we got our food relatively quick. The manager was very friendly and hung out with us to chat for a bit. Definitely recommended and they got a live scorpion tank up front!"}
{"text":"The food was okay but not big portions.   I ordered take out, they had no record of my paying online.  The hostess tried to charge me again.  The food was not ready when it was supposed to be.  After waiting 15 minutes I was given the wrong order.  I do not recommend ordering take out."}
{"text":"Great food here and wonderful hours!  The only reason I can't give this a 5 star is due to the staff tending to miss the coupons you give them. If you have one of the many coupons floating around or the \"check-in\" drink special, make sure it's taken off your bill. Remember to tip on amount before discount."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was terrible. Came around midnight and it wasn't too crazy, plenty of open tables but took at LEAST 10 min before a hostess/staff came over to the front. There were plenty of staff around but just seemed like they were disappearing and took so long to order and get our check. I think the staff needs better training and organization."}
{"text":"The BEST food! Hands down. Everyone I was with loved it. Vegans. Non vegans etc!! Delicious salsa and chips, yummy burritos. My friend said he had the beet chicken tacos he's ever had in his life! I will always bring people here. Please open one in LA!!!"}
{"text":"We were a tad bit hung over on Are last night in Vegas and we were starving.  I found nacho daddy on yelp and was so excited because nachos are one of my favorite meals ever. We ordered this massive nacho dish and it was exploding with flavor and heat!  We like it hot and spicy.  The food was amazing and we really wanted to try the scorpion tequila shot but, I was a wimp and we decided to take a rain check.  The restaurant is fun, decorative, stylish, great atmosphere,  TVs playing music videos and just a fun spot.  Service was fabulous!  I'm a huge fan!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat while you're in Vegas. Reasonably priced food. It wasn't the best Mexican I've ever had but it wasn't bad. Service was very good too!"}
{"text":"A full page of vegan menu options brought us here while visiting Vegas.  I'm vegetarian and was traveling with a vegan friend and we both enjoyed our meal.  We ended up going back again during our stay and during the 2nd visit, they had beer battered avocado street tacos!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for nacho lovers. We ordered the enchilada red sauce Nacho and it was great. Tons of flavor. Tasted even better when I asked for queso. Service was great also. Very personable."}
{"text":"I loooooooove me some nachos, so I was all on board for this dinner out. I was sorely disappointed by the time we were all done. We were seated quickly, which was great, but then no one asked us if we wanted drinks or a kid's menu for our little one. So we sat for awhile patiently and then a server came over and we asked to please bring those things over for us. We ordered our appetizer (queso dip - by recommendation from a friend who had been a patron at a different location). The server asked if we wanted salsa with it and I said that I did. When we received it, no salsa was with it and the queso was pretty lackluster. It was a very pale yellow color and it paled in taste as well. It was just sort of bland, like I've had better grocery store queso. From a place called Nacho Daddy, we expected more/better.  We ordered from the kid's menu for our son (macaroni and cheese) and asked for it to be brought out before our food (parents out there know why). They brought it out and my husband couldn't even cut through the noodle, it was so hard and so chewy. We had to send it back because it wasn't edible. The server came back and said the manager apologizes and that he agreed it was hard and they will make us a new one. They fixed it and brought it back and it was clearly much better, so I don't know what happened the first time.  Then the nachos that i ordered came (filet mignon nachos) and I was fully expecting a nacho place to get it right. Wrong. The nachos weren't at all layered, so once you pull off 1 or 2 chips that are loaded with the toppings, everything underneath is just chip. You'd think they'd know better!  I ended up not eating much more than 10 chips fully loaded before I was all done. We saw the s'mores dessert on the Yelp check-in that I did while I was there and we thought it looked amazing and wanted to give it a try. Let me just tell you...it was really good, but it's huge. I recommend 4 ppl sharing that bad boy. Seriously though, best part of the whole dinner right there. Only problem was it was so big and that sort of dish isn't edible later, so we had to leave a big portion untouched.  My husband got a sandwich and he said it was great. So maybe they should change their name or their business model. Nacho Jr. would be better due to the clear miseducation on nacho best practices!  When all was said and done, we left with a $75.00 bill (yikes!) and they STILL charged us $1 for a side of ranch even though they had a lot of missteps themselves (including not ever mentioning that a side of ranch was $1...first we learned was when we saw the bill).   Won't be back unless it's new management/chef. Really disappointing experience overall."}
{"text":"Where do I start? During my visit to Las Vegas I decided to try this spot. It is conveniently located at Miracle Mile on the outside of the mall. Both the inside and bar area are  spacious. It has a sports bar feel, and the food is on par with many of my favorite Mexican restaurants. They are known for their nachos and boy they did not disappoint! I tried the filet mignon nachos and they were piled high with all of the toppings that should go on nachos. I had jalapenos on the side. The drinks were allso great!"}
{"text":"The best bartender! His drinks are the best! And the nachos are amazing! They also have a self serve beer wall!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great happy hour!! It runs 3-6pm Mondays-Saturday!!   The baked potato nacho is the only nacho on the HH menu but it's still yummy! My favorite nacho is the Thai Chicken and Filet Mignon!! :) can't go wrong!!   Check in for your free margarita!! They use sweet and sour but my goodness it's yummy in my tummy, you can't taste the sweet and sour mix!!   PS NACHO DADDY! Anthony was awesome and prompt!! Fed us well and even did a little dance!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by late night after the JLO concert and wanted a little something to eat so we stopped by for some nachos and so glad we did!  This place has a cool hip nice sports bar feel with a some good music.    But now for the nachos...  we had the Enchilada Nachos with one side green and the other red sauce. They were THE BOMB!   Full of chicken, sauce, flavor and juicy yummy-ness for only $14.   So far these nachos are on my top 10 list for nachos. Will go back next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'll leave 3 stars because of 2 big reasons. 1 service at first was horrible the door guy checked me in ... I don't know if there was suppose to be a hostess there or not b/c after he sat us he went behind the bar to bartend. I waited ... And waited ... And waited, until about 12-15 min later the same guy walks over and asked if we have been helped.  He apologized and said he would tell his MgR, and so he did.  He took great care of us afterwards. Food was great and delicious.  Drinks (I got micheladas) were on point and really good too!  The waiter promised me he would take care of 1 drink and my appetizer.  I thanked him and told him he was great and maybe someone was having an off day that I understood.  The 2nd part comes in when I get the bill, he took care of my appetizer and 2$ extra but not my drink as promised.  I would have been ok if he told me he was going to take care of my appetizer only, but don't tell me your going to do something and not do it.  That's the worst !   Worst part about the experience is it was dead, so they had no excuse on the amount of time to attend someone.  Would I recommend it to someone ... I don't know if they have service like that maybe not, but the food is really good!  I think the Mgr should have been out on the floor helping if they were short handed, or whatever the case was.  I saw a few employees just standing in the back just staring right back at me ! WTF! That is another management problem."}
{"text":"My first trip to this nacho heaven exceeded my expectations. Great nachos, great beer, great service, and even better margaritas. I will visit this spot every trip I make to Vegas. Even better,  this place makes me want to make more trips Vegas. My wife and I, come to Vegas to experience culinary deliciousness and Nacho Daddy is at the top of the list for must experience when we arrive."}
{"text":"This was an excellent place for lunch on the Las Vegas strip. We stopped in during happy hour, and ordered cheese nachos, and a few mini nacho plates and tacos from the happy hour menu. The cheese nachos were delicious, and covered with pickled jalapeños. The strawberry margaritas were delicious, and only $5 during happy hour. The service was excellent and the bartenders were very friendly! Definitely would come back here again."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Have been twice now....first time two days ago for dinner. We shared the boneless bbq chicken wings, they were okay, slightly dry. I had the grilled lobster tacos which were very good, soft corn tortillas and a good mango salsa. I also ordered a side of black beans instead of refried, and they were good. Hubby had a pollo burrito, solid choice, and it came wet(but not very). The other two in our group had a Carne Asada burrito and enchiladas. Both enjoyed their dinners as well.  Today we went back to try breakfast. I ordered the breakfast burrito with sausage. It definitely is big(I only ate 1/2), but here's the thing....it was okay....but not one of my top ten. So, in my humble opinion, and being a native Cali, this was pretty plain, and had a fair amount of grease dripping out. The contents were hash browns, scrambled eggs, cheese put on top and then it appeared that the sausage were patties that had been weirdly chopped and put on top of the hash brown/egg/cheese. It almost looked layered. No pico, no crema, no guac or avocado.....just plain. I literally was dumping the salsa(that came on the side), and Cholula to get some moisture/flavor. Hubby had the steak omelette and really liked it.   We probably would return, but I feel like you need to know what to order, as not everything is a standout. But I do think they are known for their nachos(hence the name, lol), and we did see a lot of them being served around us.  In the end it's not going to beat any of our favorite Taqueria's in Nor Cal, or the Central Coast, but the food here is fresh, and the service is great.  I don't want to forget....we did enjoy two pitchers of margaritas with dinner, Patron Anejo, on the rocks. Not cheap on the pours, and tasty!"}
{"text":"To begin, there's only like 5 nachos choices and the ones that we ate sucked. They were dry and uncooked beef. The only food that was good were the fries. Service was very slow. We were waiting for refills, sauce, and the check. Overall bad experience. I'd rather go to Rubios."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour- have been thinking about it all day.. pass this place once a week for work and glad to finally try it. Ordered BBQ nachos, BBQ slider and chimichanga for apps on happy hour. Got he margarita (thanks Yelp) and a rum and diet. Rum and diet was a little weak, but it all tasted good! Nothing to shout home about, but it's worth experiencing if you want comfort food and drinks on the strip at a decent price- especially with happy hour being Mon-Sat 3-6!"}
{"text":"Supreme tostado nachos are bomb ! Service was fast and the staff here are very friendly. Definitely coming back when I wanna get my nacho fix!"}
{"text":"Really like this place for breakfast/brunch.  They have $20 bottomless mimosas (current at the time of writing, June '17) and our bartender had no problem adding bubbly when we thought the OJ ratio was a bit high.  Second piece of boozing advice is their Cadillac Margarita is MUCH better if you ask the bartender to make it with lime juice instead of sour mix; makes it taste much more like a proper margarita, but I know some people like the (sweet) sour mix that I think makes margaritas taste like lime sports drink, so get it normal if that's your thing.  The Grand Marnier floater makes it compete pretty closely with Margaritaville's $12 'perfect margarita' which has no mix, just booze and lime.  For food, I've had the chicken enchiladas with salsa verde (green sauce, not red) and they were definitely above average as far as enchiladas go.  Obviously not authentic Mexican but reasonable for a touristy Vegas Strip restaurant.  The chicken quesadillas are huge; my wife ate half and was full.  I had one and it was also above average.  For the price, and location, I'm giving four stars because most Vegas Strip places are just mediocre food at high prices, and I left here feeling like I got a good meal and some decent drinks, at a price that matched.  A bit of side entertainment while we dined was watching some other folks at the bar order the tourist trap scorpion tequila shot, basically $20 for a shot of tequila that has an actual scorpion inside that you're supposed to eat.  The advice I heard the server giving them was chew it, don't try to swallow it.  They hadn't worked up the courage to down it by the time we left lol."}
{"text":"I had an early lunch at Nacho Daddy and I was pleasantly surprised how yummy my tortilla soup and how fresh my kale salad was. I had good service from my host Jaylen and my server wasn't bad either, I think she may have been new. I think this is good spot to take friends or eat by yourself. My only compliant is the music was a little loud for my taste. Overall I would defiantly eat here again."}
{"text":"We loved this place. Great service, an amazing menu, and the food was amazing. They had music and dance videos playing on some of the TVs, and hockey on the rest.  Husband and I shared fajitas. Plenty of food for us, and it was prepared perfectly. The kids meals are HUGE! They also told us they have a kids eat free day, so definitely call and ask for details."}
{"text":"Omg the nachos was amazing!!!  If u near by you have to try!! We sat at the bar because the place was crowded the bartender he helped with questions ."}
{"text":"Ordered the filet mignon nachos and they were pretty good and a bit spicey. They definitely give you a large portion! Very filling. Next time I'll make room for dessert."}
{"text":"GO HERE FOR YOUR HANGOVER CURE. I came here with 3 other friends on a saturday morning. We got fajita with shrimp and chicken, pork chimichanga, and Filet Mignon Nachos. They were all great, the fajita veggies were soooo well seasoned I was so surprised, the shrimps and chicken were alright. The chimichanga was my least favorite of the three, it was pretty heavy with too much carbs and the pork was not super seasoned - it was too much of a mush. The Filet Mignon Nachos, however, was amazing!!! highly recommend it. The meat was well seasoned with crunch from nachos and creaminess from cheese and extra toppings from the tomatoes and guacamole. I did not like the beans in it though, but that's my fault for forgetting to ask for it off.  Overall Taste 4/5 Service 4/5 great service, our waiter and host were so nice and fast Parking 3/5 hotel parking Price 4/5 typical Vegas price"}
{"text":"Love love love their shrimp ceviche!! Tastes just as it should! My 2nd fav is their tortilla soup!! Both so bomb!! Honestly, all their food is good. Every time I've brought a friend from out of town they've liked what they've ordered. Lauren the bartender is THE BEST! As well as female waitress Ryan! You'd be lucky to be served be either of these ladies when visiting this Las Vegas strip location"}
{"text":"There is better Mexican food on the strip, but Nacho Daddy has probably the best Mexican rice I have ever had.  My friend finished his rice and not his tacos, that's how good the rice was, and how bland the tacos were.  On the bright side, the house margaritas are strong and delicious, and my enchiladas were up to snuff."}
{"text":"Richard my server was absolutely amazing! Great service! First time here and he made sure I understood the menu and food and also recommended some things!"}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise!  Thought would give it a shot based on yelp reviews and was glad that we did.  Not surprisingly this place specializes in nachos.  They have over a dozen different options where it is more than just changing a topping a two.  We started with the queso dip.  This was actually one of the best ones that I have had.  It was a nice portion and the unique aspect was that it was set up almost like a fondue holder having a flame underneath to keep the cheese melted.  We then had an order of the spicy shrimp nachos and the smothered burrito.  Both hit the spot!  The nachos are definitely big enough for 2 to share and be more than filled.  This isn't going to be fine dining by any means but if you are looking for something above fast food Mexican at a reasonable price this is a solid option."}
{"text":"Good music, cool ambiance and decent Mexican food for Vegas. The portions are large, so you can easily split one entree and an appetizer and be full to the brim. We had the filet mignon nachos and the shrimp and filet mignon fajita plate. The nachos were super tasty, with an added bonus flavor of stewed tomatoes.   The fajita was good as well, refried beans were excellent,  and they give you a little \"show\" by frying it tableside. Being from California,  we never expect too much from out of state Mexican food, but this place actually surprised us!"}
{"text":"Spicy shrimp nachos were most excellent.  Would order again.  Service is a little slow but worth the  wait."}
{"text":"I love this place! *open late *full menu offered late  *vegan menu!   I found this place after we watch the amazing jlo show and Las Vegas we were craving Mexican food as a vegan I thought my options would be limited. But boy was I wrong.  We arrived here around midnight we got seated right away I checked in to Yelp and got the free Margarita a For my husband. He said it was made just right .  I ordered from the vision menu the street of avocado  tacos and the vegan nachos. The tacos were delicious the of avocado is deep fried the toppings on top are just perfect with a little hint of lemon they are delicious. My husband stole one from me and he said that those tacos were better than his Buffalo wings that he had ordered . We sure the nachos which were a pile high and full of flavor and freshness. Definitely will be coming back here when I hit Vegas again.   Shout out to Harol (the guy with the hair) great service!"}
{"text":"Had a great deal going on (that we passed on), 2 pitchers and 10 street tacos for $19.99.  Food was good.  Salsa was good. Beer was cold."}
{"text":"Happy to report I diverted a group of 12 from enduring poor service, mediocre food and that ridiculous charge for chips and salsa.  They report enjoying 5-star plus food and service at Flaming Fajitas on Tropicana just west of Ft. Apache."}
{"text":"Came here with coworkers and had Richard as or waiter. Had the steak and shrimp fajitas and they were yummy! Finished off the night with some apple pie nachos! Recommend both!"}
{"text":"Jovanny, Shon, Tyler and Audre were the classiest and coolest servers/manager/hostess we have experienced while having fun in Vegas. Free margs and just super laid back and friendly as hell. Thank you! Please visit this place!!!"}
{"text":"My experience at Nacho Daddy was amazing!  While on vacation I stumbled across Nacho Daddy, and my overall experience was amazing!   My boyfriend and I ordered the bottomless chips and salsa, it comes with 2 different salsa's, so we got mild and medium. Both were delicious and the chips were crisp and hot, not too salty, just right.  My boyfriend ordered the beer battered fish tacos, and before I could finish white peach drink (which was also very tasty) he was finished and seemed very satisfied with his food.  I dont remember the exact name of what I ordered, however it was the Nacho's with multiple cheeses and chicken. They gave us so much food, that I could barely finish my meal.   Our Waitress, I dont remember her name as well (it was a good night , lol), but she had pink hair and she was lovely. Very attentive, friendly patient, and she made sure we got our food on time. She really made this whole dinner experience enjoyable.  Will return when I am back in vegas, for sure!  FOOD 5/5 SERVICE 5/5"}
{"text":"Free Margarita at check in was great! Their portions are massive for the nachos, so great for sharing! Wish they did something for my girlfriend after we said it was her birthday, but they kind of left her hanging."}
{"text":"I had a nachos with guacamole and it was amazing!! Our waiter was amazing and very friendly and yummy food."}
{"text":"A group of us decided to eat here. Its a small cozy place, clean...but the wait staff are very pleasant and courteous always making sure your drinks are refilled. Their nachos are great enough to share and the fajitas are very tasty...i really enjoyed the chicken wings full of flavor its not just a typical buffalo wing. I would definitely recommend this place for lunch or quick snack"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! Great service and atmosphere as well. I went on a weekday and got it to go but the service was nice and fast. The shrimp nachos tasted delightful"}
{"text":"In Vegas for the weekend to celebrate my birthday & see JLo. Hubby loves Mexican food so he did what everyone else does & checks out Yelp. We took a short walk from The Park MGM across the street to the location next to Buffalo Wild Wings. Thought we had reservations and discovered there are 3 locations. Luckily we got right in. At first I was not impressed, Hot & hangry I suppose. I thought damn it's hot in here & it better be good (what a biatch). Man, was I pleasantly surprised!  By checking in on Yelp, you get a free house Margarita in a mason jar. I am not a huge fan but it was very very good! We order the queso trio to start (fresh chips, hot queso, guacamole & salsa), then the mix & match fajitas (shrimp & filet mignon) came with all the fixins & beans & rice and Elote (off the cob). Thank God we shared! It was amazing from start to finish and Taylor B. our waitress was awesome (all the staff were very friendly & helpful). We ended our meal with a complementary churro sundae that was yummy! And.....for an added bonus we were able to watch The Golden State Warriors win the 2018 NBA World Championship!! We loved the place & we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Came in for late lunch... Food is very mediocre. Ordered chick fajitas for two ( looked like service for one) chicken was tough and rubbery. Filet nachos had tiny pieces of who knows what they are calling filet.. I would try this place for happy hour, but definitely not worth the money otherwise. Good selection of tequila though"}
{"text":"Cause now I'm dying!  ........ Dying is an understatement.  Their fajitas gave me food poisoning  About 2 hours after I left I started puking and dying out of my anus whole..... and now it's the next morning and I think I'm most definitely not going to survive this new day   PS fajitas are my favorite! I might have said earlier that day that I'd die for fajitas!! Nacho daddy must have heard me lol"}
{"text":"So we seen this spot just across the way and it was a real treat! We wanted something quick easy. Or server who was Tiffany was amazing! She was prompt with taking our orders and service was always with a smile.  The nachos were excellent please try bbq chicken they went quick lol. All in all we had excellent service and great food."}
{"text":"Fun place for groups!  Order a few different ones and share or get your own and don't! Lol They have great drink specials as well Nachos we ordered were tasty, with everything in them.  Server, didn't seem very happy to be there but we left a nice tip and he seemed to lighten up....as we were leaving lol. It's all good tho. Food was good. Will try it again another day."}
{"text":"Dope atmosphere & food & drinks. Just come eat here! Nacho daddy but makes you wish is was."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch. Used the Yelp offer and got a free house margarita! We ordered nachos and a burrito. After about 15 minutes, the server passed by and was surprised we hadn't gotten our food yet. He said he would check on it. I think he forgot to put the order in. After about 5 minutes, I noticed nachos and a burrito sitting under the heating lamp. It sat there for another 15 minutes and our server was missing. It seemed like he was really hard-working so I don't blame him for being assigned too many tables. But by the time we got our food, all the chips in the nachos were completely soggy so we had to pick out the chips and eat it with a fork. It was also about 75% chicken, which meat lovers might like, but I didn't because after a few bites all that was left was shredded chicken and soggy chips.   As the server gave us our check, he apologized and seemed genuine. But I don't think I'll be back based on the food."}
{"text":"Filet nacho are amazing. We also got the naked wings with buffalo sauce and ranch.... super tasty!"}
{"text":"Laekyn was our waitress.  Great service great food.   Always the place to go for nachos and guac."}
{"text":"Another great Nacho Daddy experience! This location on the strip outside of the Miracle Mile shops is very classy. I love the open style patio design. The white peach margarita is to die for! They are so delicious, that you forget there is tequila in them. I highly recommend the fish tacos. The best part of these tacos is the fresh flour tortillas. I also got to see someone do the shot of tequila with the scorpion in it. The scorpion is dead (thank God) and it is soaked in liquor. They serve it on top of a lime on the shot glass. The waitress rings a bell as the shot is being done. This is not my type of thing LOL, but it was great for the tourists that we took there."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food! The homemade tortillas that are used for the soft tacos are to die for! Try the fresh fish tacos they are phenomenal. The nacho plates are huge, make sure you share with someone. The sliders are the best sliders I have ever had! The burgers taste like freshly homemade hamburgers like you would grill at home. The specialty margaritas are excellent, try the white peach if you like sweet drinks. They also did show us the scorpions that they will put in a shot of tequila if you want to try that...."}
{"text":"This place is just decent. The food we ordered was bland, I never though Mexican could be bland. Drinks are good and nachos as well but anything else is mediocre. Our waitress forgot to ring in some food for us, waited fifteen minutes for chips and salsa and finally then brought out our main entrees with no chips and salsa so we decided to cancel it. Heard the table behind is complaining about something similar, they ordered salads and then nachos but got nachos and no salad. Maybe the waitress was having a rough day but I'm a server and it's not that hard to ring in appetizers first or tell the kitchen/food runners you want them first. So over all just decent! This place did come recommended to us so maybe our experience was just a fluke thing. But I don't think This place is anything special. Oh and I forgot to mention the horrible rap music they were playing. I like some rap and I don't knock tunes till I hear it but this stuff was awful."}
{"text":"Did someone say... \"new dank af Mexican spot on The Strip with an amazing atmosphere, attentive staff, awesome ambiance, and strong drinks?\"   Why yes... yes I did.  This place was AWESOME and we had a great time coming here. After spending all day at Marquee Dayclub seeing Galantis (amazing live btw, trust me), we were looking for a new spot to try that we hadn't been to yet. My fiancee and I come to Vegas at least once a year, and so we've got many trips under our belt and believe it or not, feel like we've tried nearly everything out there.   I've always felt that The Strip lacked a really, really solid Mexican restaurant. Sure, there's Diablo's Cantina, but... meh. It's just okay. When we found this place on Yelp, of course I was down to give it a try. Mexican food is DELICIOUS, amiright? And a free margarita with a Yelp check-in? We'll now you're just being nice.  We headed over there for an early dinner around 5PM. The spot wasn't packed but there were people in there, and it definitely started to fill up with a fun crowd by the time we left. I still technically call this place \"on the strip,\" but you will have to walk about 40 seconds down a side street to get to it so if you don't immediately see it, it's just around the corner.   I ordered a chicken and carne asada taco plate and my fiancee got a salad. Both were absolutely FANTASTIC. We also got this delicious drip trio which came with chips (duh), guac, salsa (AMAZING!), and the most out-of-this-world bomb-dot-com queso dip that was just the best ever. If you're anything like me, you know that what can seriously make or break a Mexican spot is their chips and salsa -- for me, even if the food is meh, and the chips and salsa are amazing, it's a win in my book. Happy to say, this place nails it on all regards.  As I mentioned, food is amazing quality. Carne, Chicken, and my fiancee's salad were all on point, and the drinks were delicious, refreshing and strong (as they should be).  If you've made it this far in the review, I'm not sure why you're still reading and haven't already started heading over there... unless you have at which point I'll commend you for being such a damn good multitasker. Anyways, you won't regret your trip here. The vibe and customer service are fantastic and it's a great place to grab some food before you paint Sin City red."}
{"text":"Terrible service from Cassandra sitting up at the bar. Waited 20 minutes to have my card ran, no waters, not interested in serving us at all. Food was ok but with service like that I have no desire to return."}
{"text":"I had the Thai nachos, steak and shrimp tacos, and the spicy pina margarita. The food was delicious and margarita was spot on. All served up by Dean! Great customer service! Definitely coming back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots I have to come to everytime were in Vegas.  There food is absolutely delicious and their customer service is amazing. Aly is a waitress we look for everytime we come in. She makes us and our friends super comfortable and welcoming. Check them out!"}
{"text":"I hope no one takes this 3 star rating as a slight. These ain't ya daddy's nachos but they are still very good. This location isn't the easiest to uber to but for reference there is a area a little past the restaurant where the uber can drop you off. There is a aquarium in the front with a couple scorpions unfortunately they weren't social during my wait for the table. We got seated in about minutes. There were plenty of TVs for any night you're looking to catch a game. We got started with some chips and salsa which are a great way to soak up a tiny bit of alcohol. and our server started us off with a couple waters and took our drink orders. We got a frozen margarita no salt and a ginger ale We ended up with a classic margarita with salt and a pepsi. The classic margarita is good and strong. I'd call it a potential hair of the dog candidate.  It took about 15-20 minutes for a delicious plate of nachos make its way out but unfortunately it wasn't ours. The next two plates were and they were piled high with toppings. For the price a definite deal. They have a wide variety of nachos with different proteins for your tasting pleasure. We ended up getting the BBQ chicken nachos and the classic nachos. The chips kept their crunch throughout most of the plate I never ran out of toppings.  The service during this trip was just a little distracted. Our server seemed to have their mind elsewhere and brought out drinks that were different from what we ordered and had food sent out that wasn't ours but the nachos were good. Nacho Daddy is a place worth checking out if you're a nacho fan or simply need to absorb some alcohol with a little hair of the dog for the hangover. I don't think distracted service is a normal thing at Nacho Daddy."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner since it was close to our hotel room. It was also based on the name. It wasn't that full so we sat at the bar. The service was a little hit and miss. The bartender didn't seem to want to be there and left half way through our dinner so we got a new bartender which was a lot more attentive.   For food we got a couple different nachos and split them all. We got the buffalo chicken nachos, pulled pork nachos, and fiesta nachos. The buffalo chicken nachos good, but very heavy on the sauce. The pulled pork nachos were extremely good and more than enough for 2 people! The fiesta nachos had a nice kick to them as well.   There was a nice large menu of margaritas to choose from. We got the Cadillac margarita and it was on the sweeter side. Not too bad, but maybe a little too much triple sec."}
{"text":"Our waitress Laekyn, was super cool! I asked if we could change one of the channels on TV to watch Greys Anatomy and she made it possible! :')  She was super friendly and very attentive.  Of course the food never disappoints and the free (w/ check in) margaritas don't either! ;)"}
{"text":"Judy was the best server ever! It was our first time at Nacho Daddy and every recommendation was solid!  she checked up on us consistently to follow up on the recommendations and was just attentive...the experience was amazing and she took it to the next level #servergoals #winning #judykilledit #judynachodaddy Get you a Judy lol  So if you decide to try it out...you have to get the Spicy Cucumber Margarita! Filet Mignon Nachos! Or Supreme tostada Nachos!"}
{"text":"Jovany is amazingggg. He made our party feel so welcome and taken care of! Had so much fun even though we were too scared to take the scorpion shots! Thanks, Jovany!!"}
{"text":"Great service while in Vegas! Food was delicious, especially during the late night venture we had. Our waiter was extremely courteous and made us feel extremely important when he noticed our food took a little too long to come out of the kitchen. Will remember this place the next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Had the filet mignon nachos and they were fantastic!  Huge portion that can be shared by a bunch.  This was our breakfast meal for 2.  Definitely need to check them out.  They are right off the strip behind Planet Hollywood so not far off the strip."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy was fun and yummy. The yelp deal on the free house margaritas is great and our waiter CJ was really nice and helpful.  We shared the lobster and crab nachos- they didn't really have enough of the seafood and had too much sriracha- next time I'd ask for it on the side. Also they were not very hot when they came out. The Mexican corn side dish was delicious.  Others in our party had the chicken enchiladas and plain cheese nachos and said they were good.  The Mexican Candy margarita was very pretty to look at and was delicious- it is very sweet!! The ambiance in the restaurant left a little to be desired - it was pretty warm in the restaurant. Granted it was over 100° outside and the restaurant has very high ceilings, so I am sure it's hard to keep it cool, but we would have been more comfortable had the restaurant been cooler. Also, the music needed to be a little bit louder to create more of a fun atmosphere. We always gauge places by whether or not we would go back- I would go back but I will try something different next time!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. They have a full vegan menu which was great for me. I ordered the chik'n nachos. The chips were green. Everything was yummy. I almost ate the whole thing. My friend ordered the breakfast burrito. I didn't get a picture because I was too busy eating my nachos. I also ordered a michelada. Fun place to try it when in Vegas. I will be going again!!!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice in the last few months while working various tradeshows. The free margarita is cool, and tasty, but the food is seriously good at a very good price. If you are staying at the Marriott Grand Chateau - it's the best chill place to hang out and eat some tasty food and have some tequila after 11. Good service each time !"}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly customer service. Also great atmosphere. Will definitely return here again in the future. A++"}
{"text":"If you want to eat off the vegan menu, call ahead and make sure they haven't run out of ingredients to make items on the vegan menu.  We went and were told they'd had too many vegans recently and hadn't been given enough of the vegan queso from their distribution center and had run out a while back.  Ugh, wasted $20 round trip in Uber to go here, wait for a table and then not have what we went there for."}
{"text":"You get a decent meal here and you don't leave hungry. Nachos are $10-20. Other menu items are also mostly $10-20. They have happy hour snack specials for $4 and $5 that are a very good deal. A dinner of fiesta nachos and the seafood enchiladas came to $36, not including drinks."}
{"text":"Went there for first time on Saturday just before noon. We waited about five minutes to be greeted and then we were told they were short staffed and it would be a twenty minute wait. He said 'wait staff needs chance to catch up' The restaurant and bar were virtually empty."}
{"text":"Bad food that is way overpriced. Inedible nachos that were served soggy with minimal cheese and jalapenos."}
{"text":"My visit was on April 4 with my friend in the afternoon. It was a slow day and there was about six customers in the restaurant. Our server was not attentive at all which is funny given that there was hardly any customers in the restaurant. The food was okay, I had better at Roberto's."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Really chill environment. Our server was Dj and he was really fun and charming. He was dancing when he took our order. Super funny. Definitely recommend dj"}
{"text":"Won't Be Back! Just left Nacho Daddy because the waitress and manager REFUSED to honor my Yelp offer (margarita) unless they witnessed my Check-in. Ok Fine, I asked if I could please Check-in at the end of my meal (being female it's safer) NOPE!! She said \"No!\" I asked for Manager he said \" No!\" He said the owners set the rule he follows it. I said, \" I said I  will check-in  when leaving and show it, if not charge me for the margarita and  also showing him my reviews, explaining safety concern, and SHOWING him my legitimate Yelp Account, NOPE!   Ok, so waited and waited.   Whatever,  the waitress was not going to give us good service after manager left our table. Her name started with an \"L\" not a common name. Her attitude and the manager's cost this company our business  tonight as well as future!! We walked out.   We will not return. Way to go Nacho Daddy employees, $120-$170 a week $$$ GONE, because you didn't value my safety!!  Attitude From Waitress Was Beyond Unacceptable!! Manager Is Suppose To Make Sure The Customer Is Happy Within Reason, This Was A Complete Fail!!"}
{"text":"Big servings. You can definitely share one order of nachos with another person and have plenty to eat. Good nachos. Margaritas are nice and strong. Recommend sitting at bar and ordering do you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"The serve here is great. I love this place always keep coming back. The food and drink are bomb."}
{"text":"Been here many times and the service is always good. Our waiter today is Lee and so far his been doing a really good job take an care of us . As far as the food good it's always good. Don't forget to check in on yelp to get a free house margarita."}
{"text":"I had a friend from out of town fly in for a couple days. He was in the mood for Mexican and nacho daddy is the best I've had since moving to town. The waitress we had was great. She helped us decipher the drink menu and helped pair our drinks and meals. She was quick to bring everything to us which is a compliment to all staff (kitchen and all) the food was great and we received large portions. We had to-go boxes for days! The atmosphere is welcoming and helps make for a great experience. I can't wait to go back with friends and try something new!"}
{"text":"Well another awesome find, with out ranting this place rocks! The food, 5 on flavor, 5 on price, 5 on portion size and service. Wish we had one back home."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Definitely would go back and have Jovany as my server! Super outgoing & friendly. One of the best, amazing food of course!!"}
{"text":"A.J. is a fantastic server  (no I'm not his mom). Great guy and helpful,  knowing how to answer questions you didn't even know you had,  at a great restaraunt.  Food is stellar, very good value, and atmosphere is fun. Take the scorpion shot!"}
{"text":"BOMB! We we're staying the hotel in the same shopping center and after a wedding we were starving! So we went over and picked up an order of shredded chicken nachos...   THEY CAME IN A PIZZA BOX! That is how massive these were lol. There were so many amazing topping... we basically just dug in with our fingers and ate till we were ready to pass out.   The only reason this isn't a 5 star is... they needed more cheese... it felt light for a nacho, ya know? And to-go orders REALLY need forks with them. These are massive and delicious but the chips do get soggy fast and since there are so many toppings they get heavy.   Other than that I WISH we had one in Reno/Sparks  *hint hint*"}
{"text":"Picked up lunch here. Greater at the door by a pair of scorpions before seated. Great margarita and nachos. This is defiantly not my daddy's Nachos!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service...Jovany is the best! Supreme nachos were fantastic! Very authentic red chili - NM native approved."}
{"text":"Came in today for my besties birthday lunch, it was amazing. I ended up getting the red and green enchiladas and a couple of specialty drinks all recommend by Our amazing waiter AJ his enthusiasm and product knowledge where above par, be sure to make #NACHODADDY a stop on your Vegas to-do list!"}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food! I think I expected more of the Nachos since the name is nacho Daddy. The shrimp Tacos are good! Great flavor and seasoned well! I'd come back and try something different. I'm a seafood eater so next time maybe the lobster Nachos... clean, good service and they were fast! But I came in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Ordered supreme tostada nacho w/o meat and vegan fajita bowl with regular sour cream... Food was absolutely delicious and very filling. Will definitely come again! The nachos are spicy... If you can't handle spice... Stay away from it."}
{"text":"We came during off peak hours and if check in with YELP app they offer a free margarita. Our waitress Ariana had no problem giving it to 2 people in our party. She was courteous and fast with our order. She explained to us about ordering the edible SCORPION and the extra cost to any drink.  Our nachos were enough for two so we shared them with others. They were real good. The scorpion, we were advised to chew it and not swallow it whole, tasted like tequila. On top of the great service they added a 20% military discount."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick afternoon snack since we had late dinner reservations. Our waiter was full of energy and just plain fun. Ordered the chili chicken nachos. The chicken was tender and the chips were crisp. Well seasoned and delicious. Definitely would come back again when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing food and company here...got the supreme nachos and Bangkok tacos! Scarlett was awesome, highly recommend this place over the other noise in Vegas.  You can get a scorpion shot, with a scorpion in it (pinchers removed). Awesome concept, viva las vegas"}
{"text":"Brian was so amazing! He really made our experience  great. When I'm here I always either ask for him or Jasmin. Love the vegan menu it's one of the best in town!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, good service, no issues here. Has Vegan options for those who aren't meat friendly. The beer dispensers are a good idea, I just haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"Every time I come this place never lets me down. If you're a meat eater you HAVE to try the shrimp/crab nachos- they're amazing. They have an entire vegan menu with a chimichanga that's large and crispy as well as the chikn nachos that are so so filling. My fiancé and I also downed the vegan chocolate raspberry cake in about 2 seconds. Love this place."}
{"text":"Nachos on par with excellence and service to boot bathed in Golden nacho sauce. The service was with the swiftness and helpful too. Come in for taco Tuesday avacado tacos super delish!"}
{"text":"Was excited about trying a laid back place on the strip so we chose this place within walking distance. We walked in a party of 2 to a nearly completely empty restaurant and then had to wait 10 minutes for them to \"put a table together\" before we finally just decided to sit at the bar. Ordered the Supreme something or other and both of us  specifically said sour cream on the side, so of course when it comes out we have to send it back being it was covered in sour cream! They took care of it without issue but it just meant waiting a little longer for food. Service was OK at the bar as the bartender seemed attentive enough but there wasn't a lot for her to do as the place was empty. The bar itself had a musty smell like dirty water that kept wafting through as we tried to hang out and enjoy the ambiance.. But alas the stomachs started churning and we spent the most of the rest of the night sick and nauseated and ended up turning in early.. And side note the one beer we had there was all that was drank that night so it wasn't an illness due to any recreational activities.. Sad our first night in Vegas ended in duress but we will make more educated decisions in the future!"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in and sat at the bar, we felt like this place was special!  Living right up the street and driving by often, we finally decided to give Nacho Daddy a shot. The complimentary House Margaritas were a bonus. Then, all of a sudden, our awesome server/bartender Zach, sent a complimentary order of chips our way, even though we were simply doing a take-out order. All we wanted was to order some of their famous nachos, but we were given exceptional service before the food even arrived. Being treated so nicely right off the bat leaves an awesome taste in our moths already. I can't image how fabulous the food will taste once we get it home.   We will be back! Thank toy Zach!"}
{"text":"Expectations were minimal but this ended up being a great spot!  We were craving Mexican and ended up going here TWICE during our long weekend. Great alternative to all the overpriced tourist traps."}
{"text":"If your drunk and want a huge plate of nachos for $15 this is the place for you. If you sober and want good Mexican food keep on looking. Nothing was terrible but it was all very simple and bland. There are too many great places in Vegas to eat to waste your time here. I will give it 2 stars though because our service was good"}
{"text":"A very meh place. Nothing horribly wrong, but I wouldn't go out of your way to come here. I got the chicken tamale and checked in on Yelp for a free house margarita. Our waiter told us to upgrade to the larger size for only $2-$3 for a higher grade of tequila, which 2 of my friends ordered. Here are my thoughts...  Chicken tamale: 3 stars. COMES WITH CILANTRO (not marked on the menu). It was definitely not the best tamale I've had. Not awful but I love tamales and I couldn't finish this one. It was too salty but not flavorful, if that makes sense. It lacked taste, and the salt only made it worse.   House margarita: 5 stars. Tasty and adequately alcoholic. The tequila in the house margarita actually tasted better than the upgraded one my friends got. This seemed more alcoholic as well.  Upgraded margarita: I can't rate this as I didn't order this but my friends said the tequila didn't taste good and it was barely alcoholic. Stick to the house margarita!  Service: 1.5 stars. Our waiter was nice but ohhhh my god was he slow. It took him 20 minutes to grab our bill, then another 20 to figure out how to separate our checks. My biggest complaint was his response to me not realizing there was cilantro on the chicken tamale. I specifically checked the menu to make sure cilantro wasn't listed, as for many other food items, it was on the description as an ingredient. When I told him I can't eat cilantro, he said \"you should've told me this when you ordered\" and he annoyedly took my plate back. Pretty sure all they did was scrape off the mound of cilantro on top, as I could still taste it and saw bits of it in my food when I got it back. Waiter has a point that I could've mentioned this, but he could've been nicer in his tone and the menu was misleading.  Would not come back, but if they're still running the Yelp deal for a free house margarita, sure, come here I guess..."}
{"text":"I find Mexican Food in Vegas to be lacking overall so none of the places here are Tex Mex which is my preference. Went with the family and for 3 adults and 1 child it was over $100 which I think is totally outrageous. My cheese enchilada plate was about $15.00! We didn't even order drinks so I feel violated.   The food was better than average for Vegas but for the amount of money the portions were small and chips and salsa were not free.   Service was excellent however so I'm willing to give it another try. Perhaps lunch is more affordable. If I'm spending over $100 then I'm headed to the strip for gourmet vittles."}
{"text":"LOVEEEE. A huge group of us came to Nacho Daddy for lunch and we all loved our food. The restaurant itself is huge, with big screens playing a very random assortment of old hits. There are also a bunch of birds inside, which I wasn't a huge fan of because it felt like they were going to fly into me or poop on me.  There's a free margarita with check-in, and they do NOT skimp on the alcohol. You can have it either regular or blended, or even upgrade to a fancier margarita and just pay the difference.  The nacho servings here are so huge that we shared 1 plate of nachos for every 2 people. My friend and I got the spicy shrimp nachos and we loved them!! They're a perfect amount of spicy, and the shrimp is seasoned and so flavorful!! I love how there are so many toppings that no chip has to be eaten dry.  The prices are more than reasonable too- I believe our spicy shrimp nachos were $18.95. We paid less than $10 each for a huge plate of nachos and a margarita!"}
{"text":"This place was great! They have so many different and unique options for nachos. I tried the thai chicken and my husband tried the buffalo chicken. Both were delicious! In addition there are many other items (mostly Mexican) on the menu. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive even though we had a large group of 8."}
{"text":"So our service was ok, but there was drama between the servers that caused things to be not as good as it could be. And that basically sums up the atmosphere there. If you just want booze and a giant plate of nachos and care not about service or the quality, it's a good option. The food was average, it wasn't bad, but it is not something I really want to have again."}
{"text":"Yum yum yummmm!!! This place was so delicious!! I got one of the huge burritos and it was to die for!! Their margaritas are also definitely amazing! The service was also great and the waitress was very knowledgeable about the food served there! I highly recommend this place!! They also play a good bit of 90's alternative which was nice to relive my childhood during our experience here!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I would have to rave about the queso! My friend ordered three orders of it! I had the bbq nachos and it was delicious. I would've liked more BBQ sauce but I really try not to be a picky customer. I will definitely be going back on my many trips to Las Vegas.   Also! If you're already on Yelp, check in for a free house margarita!"}
{"text":"Came in last night for a late night snack and a night cap. Sat at the bar and our bartender was attentive, made great margaritas, and encouraged our food choices.   Two stand out moments that will make me take my friends when they visit:  1) the bar plays what I call the Pandora of music videos. Such a great variety.  2) One of the kitchen staff was finished and sitting at the bar. He befriended a regular (I think) and bought him a shrimp taco to try since the gentleman never had one. That's the type of cool and friendly vibe I think runs throughout this location.   I can't wait to go back and have a full on meal. Also, they have a wide variety of tequila and THANK GOODNESS no slot machines at the bar."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, almost nothing about this visit, for lunch yesterday, was right.  The check-in margarita was very good, then it was all downhill.  The $10 Daddy Margarita was in a glass which was 1 in thick and packed with ice.  It, literally, had 4 sips of liquid total, so $2.50/sip.  The place filled up as we ate lunch, and they were way understaffed.  The food was delayed for a long time, and once it was brought out, you could tell the nachos had been under a heat lamp for a while.  They did not bring guac with the smothered burrito, had to ask for that, did not bring out chips and salsa, which was included as well, had to ask for that twice.  No salsa with the fajitas, and had to ask 3 times for a box near the end of the meal. I am almost positive that the dirty dishes are still on the table, as they were ignored until we were standing up to leave.  Also, the shrimp nachos were pretty skimpy and bland.  Overall: not a nice experience and we will not return."}
{"text":"Food was surprisingly good and its in a great location at Village Square which has lots of great restaurants and shops!!!  Sunday brunch, had chorizo nachos, Mexican pancakes and breakfast sausage slider.  Everything was great!  Will be back to have same items and try other stuff since they have a large menu."}
{"text":"AJ was our server. He was the man! Really got our Vegas trip off to a great start. Great spot."}
{"text":"They don't even deserve one star at that. Waited over 20 mins just to be seated. Let it be known there were plenty of open seats. While waiting, I approached a bartender to ask about drink specials for taco Tuesday. They told us the drink specials. After being seated, the waitress told us there were no specials. After waiting a total of 30 mins to get the food, it was not hot and just like warm. When asked for a new order, the waitress gave us a attitude and gave us a new order. They did not apologize or even A knowledge that we were upset. As BRI g a Vegas local, I will not return here again. I wouldn't tell any of my out of state people to visit as well"}
{"text":"Does not let down!! From the service staff, setting, cleanliness and especially the food. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Food wasn't great but wasn't the worst. We sat at the bar in order not to have to wait yet there were 10 open tables. The salsa was good and spicy, the margarita was disgusting though."}
{"text":"Fun place just off the strip. Fun atmosphere and solid food. Quesso cheese dip was good and the margaritas were delicious."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow but friendly.  Nachos were GREAT.  We would come again for sure!"}
{"text":"Went to the Sahara location yesterday with family I had in town. My Uncle is from Jersey and has a heavy accent, our server was condescending and kept mocking his accent. Not sure if she thought it was cute, it was not. Then my father proceeds to order the Beer Battered Lobster tacos and the server argued with him up and down that you guys don't have those on the menu. We legitimately had to point it out to her before she believed us. To add insult to injury she then was so non-attentive to us that we had to go ask another staff member for refills. Extremely poor experience, especially since I brought my family from out of town to show them one of my favorite spots, kinda embarrassing. The food was stellar as always, but the service (specifically the server) ruined my experience."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy does well what it claims to be good at, nachos, but lacks in other areas. I was here on a saturday afternoon, and the food and service was subpar, specially for vegas. Even though it says Miracle Mile shops, the restaurant is located on an ave slightly off the strip which confused us while we were looking for it.  The restaurant is pretty large. As you enter, they have a small waiting area with a scorpion tank, very funky. There is a large bar, a dining area, and a small patio section with 4-5 tables which is cool for people watching. The decor is decent but not special, but the ambiance was pretty dingy in the inside dining area, and not very clean. There were also pigeons flying in trying to snag scraps to eat, which was very weird.  For the food and drinks, the nachos were excellent. We got two different types of nachos, and those were made to perfection. However, the other entrees weren't as good. My burrito was very dry and lacked flavor, and the quesadilla was burnt. Some of the other entrees my friends got were nice, like the fajitas and sandwiches. The drinks were really great too. We tried a pitcher of their orange margarita which was very well made. The spicy cucumber margarita packed a kick, but was refreshing. A commendable thing here is the availability of a vegan menu, which I've hardly seen in vegas.  The service however, was really slow. There was only one server for the entire section who was overwhelmed. She was very friendly and trying her best to keep up with the crowds, but it took her a long time to get to each table. The food took a really long time to get to us as well. Prices here are really competitive, and very inexpensive for the quantity of food. Entrees are around $12-15 unlike the main strip restaurants.  This is a strong 3.5* restaurant with decent prices and food. It's not a glamorous restaurant on the strip, but I will recommend this place for a filling meal, and specially for vegans."}
{"text":"I was hoping the service was better at this location but it was non existent. There were very few in the restaurant and we waited to be seated. Our table was dirty. Our server took too long to get to our table. He was also the bartender but still no excuse. Our food took ridiculously long to come and when it did one order was wrong as it had all the things on it that we requested not to be on it.  We sent it back and upon return it was on the same plate with all the remnants of what we didn't want. They didn't even re-plate it! The onions are all mixed on the plate so we asked for a side of onions. After all that the food was amazing including the dessert! I had to ask for the check and we were charged for onions.  There was what appeared to be a manager sitting in the corner on a laptop the whole time. I highly suggest he pay attention and manage this place because the service sucks."}
{"text":"Went here with the gf because of the vegan options. Did not disappoint! We shared the vegan street tacos, which were delicious. She had a kale salad and I had the vegan nachos, which were an excellent approximation of the real ones, with plenty of pickled jalapeno. The service was also very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"We came in on a Sunday afternoon with the family. There were 4 tables occupied and it took forever to get our food.  My husband and I both ordered a Patron skinny margarita. They were HORRIBLE! I thought maybe if we added some orange slices that would help but nope. We both had a few sips and couldn't tolerate how sour they were and gave up. We drink them at other places and have never had one so bad. The worse part was the waitress never noticed they were not being consumed or inquired how they were.  The food was ok. My husband and I both had the chicken fajita salad. It was a large serving. It seemed to be lacking flavor but wasn't horriable.  One child had \"Pull my finger\" aka: chicken strips, another had tacos and the 3rd had tamales. They all enjoyed their food and said it was not spicy at all."}
{"text":"Triple Dip apatizer and Chilequiles were amazing!!!! Our bartender Cerah was absolutely amazing too! Very attentive and made strong delicious drinks! Will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Only one word to describe this place ...INCREDIBLE!!!   Their Nacho Daddy Margarita and the Vegas Golden Nights and the Crap & Lobster Nachos and Churro Sundae are all killer!!   I recommend Nacho Daddy and look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Great filet mignon on nachos, our waitress Sarah was very helpful and knowledgeable. The IPAs were limited in the beers were not up to par. However Sara was a doll and very nice."}
{"text":"Desi was awesome and the food was great. I love nachos and a good time, thanks for showing me both nacho daddy!!! Your the best!!"}
{"text":"If you like nachos, you have to come here!!! I recommend the Thai chicken nachos! We ate here three times on this trip. It's our favorite restaurant in Vegas. They have their original location off of Fremont street. Also, if you're feeling really daring try the scorpion shot. Makes for a great Facebook Live video! It's a real scorpion (dead and stinger removed) that you put in a shot with tequila and go for it! My husband did it! He got a free shot glass! They say you can use any liquor but my husband tried the recommended house tequila and said it was super smooth."}
{"text":"Great vegan eats, but service was sub-par.  I was roaming the Vegas strip late one Friday night (after midnight) and discovered that Nacho Daddy had a wide assortment of vegan options, so I had to give them a try.   I was greeted by a friendly bartender who offered me a menu. After that, he didn't come back for quite some time because he was busy chatting with guests and co-workers. I understand that engaging with customers is great, but it took away from the quality and attentiveness of service that not only I received, but that others around me received as well.   Everyone raves about the amazing vegan nachos, but I wanted to be a bit more daring. I ordered the vegan chick'n quesadilla and it was outstanding. The only thing that seemed slightly off was the consistency of the vegan sour cream (very watery/runny), but otherwise I loved the dish. They were very good about repeating back my order multiple times, leading me to believe that they pay attention to detail and want to ge vegan orders right. I even had a chef (or manager?) ask me if I received the vegan quesadilla, although it was a bit odd that this happened after I had finished eating.   Back to the service. I didn't get any silverware or napkins with the meal and it took a while to get some.   The drinks were hit and miss. The white peach margarita was very good. I hesitated due to its $13 price tag, but it was large and delicious. The house margarita was just bad. Very syrupy and too sour. I rarely leave a drink unfinished, but I couldn't even drink half of it.   Speaking of the margarita, my bartender forgot the drink, not once, but twice. Maybe it's because it was free with my Yelp check-in? Who knows.   The patrons next to me didn't get the best service either. They ordered a flaming drink, but the bartender never lit the tealight. There were also multiple occasions that drinks and entrees were brought to the wrong people.   Overall, the vegan food really boosts this review, as the drinks were inconsistent and service were mediocre."}
{"text":"Fiesta Nachos and a scorpion shot. I dare you! Great happy hour. Best nachos you'll ever have (no dry chips!). Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Arieanna was just the best server I have ever had! She was knowledgeable of the menu and her personality over the top!"}
{"text":"We came for a quiz night a few weeks ago, our first time at a Nacho Daddy. We had called ahead of time to check on the quiz starting time. They told us 7:30. We arrived at 7:15 and the quiz had already started, but we got over it and played catchup before reading the menu.  When the waiter came over, we gave him our drink order and said we needed more time to consider the menu. he brought us our drinks and then ignored us. We told the host wanted to order, and it still took the waiter another ten minutes before he came back (without even so much as an apology). He said he thought we didn't want anything, which made no sense because all we had ordered was water...  We shared a plate of shrimp nachos. They were totally gross and crazy expensive. $15 for a pile of soggy green tortilla chips (I just find using festively colored chips really odd) covered in a thick salty cream of all things. A few diced tomatoes and jalapeños had been sprinkled on the top, and of course some shrimp in there. It tasted like a pile of wet chemicals. I'm pretty sure nothing in there constituted as fresh foodstuffs.   The waiter came back to ask about desert. My friend asked for a coffee. The waiter said, \"Well, the cappuccino machine is broken. And so is the coffee maker. And we require REALLY hot water to make coffee. You see, we need it to be really HOT.\"   It was really bizarre. And of course, no apology again, just another disappearing waiter. Eventually he brought the check (after taking a shot with a table near us). We put down a card, and again waited, and waited, until finally we gave up and threw down exact change in cash and took off.   A seriously horrible experience. Quiz host was cool, but there were no multi-media type of rounds and the venue (even without the rude service and yuck food) isn't really suitable for a quiz."}
{"text":"Just like other people have mentioned, the atmosphere makes all the difference here!   The food is good but nothing extraordinary. We had the nachos and a couple margaritas and had no complaints about either!   If you're on the strip and looking for a solid option for a meal, Nacho Daddy should be in there."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Bomb margaritas, great atmosphere, and with Jovanny as your server, life is grand. Brooks Wedding!"}
{"text":"Got the tostada nachos and the enchilada nachos. I'd stick to the tostada ones. Super good!! We ordered margaritas too, got the free one for checking in. Sent both back. We're not very good. The one we ordered was the jalapeño one. Wasn't very spicy at all. Even ordered it extra spicy. Tastes very sweet. But, I'm a margarita snob. Haha.  I would come back for food. 4 stars just because margaritas weren't that great."}
{"text":"A great place the atmosphere was great. Very friendly waiters/staff. Rachel our server she was great! Nice and attentive always was checking on us. The bbq chicken nachos was great and the nacho daddy margarita was delicious. Would defiantly come back when I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"Total bar food. Food tasted like it was microwaved. The one in Henderson is so good this was such a disappointment. Fries were cold, fish and chips were bland. And Tyson has way better frozen wings."}
{"text":"Always great service and tasty food! The trio dip rocks and, if you're feeling adventurous, the scorpion shot is a fun novelty. The location is easy to access from the strip and Planet Hollywood. Edward, the AGM, is super friendly and made sure our experience was tops."}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed in any of the nacho. Arieanna was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the food and Margarita choices. We had the spicy cucumber marg, blackberry marg, and spicy Pina marg. All amazing. Not too sweet and delicious. The shrimp nachos were also to die for. If I had anymore room I would have tried another nacho. Thanks Arieanna for an awesome experience!!"}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy was nothing short of amazing! From its grand entry way to the gigantic tv screens and it seemed as if there weren't any bad areas to be seated  in this place and the overall atmosphere was vibrant even at 11am on a Sunday am.   Of course I had the vegan nachos and the portions were large enough for us to share one plate. These nachos were simply AMAZING !!! Every bite was better than the last and I was in vegan queso heaven. I checked in through Yelp which presented us with a free margarita       Our waitress let us know that we could have any Margarita with $8 off if we didn't want the one they were offering for free. So of course we upgraded and grabbed two with $8 off of each drink. I'm not much of a margarita guy but I will definitely reconsider from now on. In addition to these delicious margaritas I was given a birthday shot of.....I'm sorry I forget what it was called as I became pretty tipsy by that point (I will find out later).   Our waitress displayed exceptional customer service. She was knowledgeable, accommodating and delivered prompt service to our table.  I do not remember her name either but I'm sure she remembers us .   There is so much to love about this place that I can't write enough about it to express my overall satisfaction. In addition to how awesome Nacho Daddy is (love the name btw) they have MULTIPLE Vegan options so that everyone can enjoy their delicious nachos.    I had a very happy birthday here and I will definitely return to Nacho Daddy for more nachos, only this time I will not be sharing    Side note: they are a little pricey so come with enough cash and be sure to tip their wonderful customer service. They're well worth the price."}
{"text":"I'm back logged on my reviews but this one got put to the front of the line because I have to say it was a major disappointment experiencing this place.. I usually wait till I try a place a few times before going star crazy but as stated I have things I need to say.. The reason they get two stars instead of zero and a escalation  is  when I called to ask wait times and when we were seated both the female who answered and the gentleman who seated us both who sadly I didn't get their names were friendly and informed... Food  quality and booze was good even if my experience was not .. so let's get on with this yelp rage review from another one of those hangry yelpers shall we?    So driving down Sahara on our way to Indian Friday night we drove past nacho daddy and I recalled I tried them out originally at a yelp event and fell hard for their Mexican corn offthe cob so of course I decided before my movie date Saturday it was time for margaritas and some Mexican nachos .. Fast fwd to my evening nacho daddy experience ..   Shawn our waiter set the tone for my Saturday night meal to where this place is going to be tabled for quite sometime before I try Them again ..which is lame cause I totally planned to bring someone who isn't a square bear (my bf doesn't drink much) that will drink and  shoot Scorpion shots when I was photo ready cause admittedly I was in cozy clothes to prep for three hours at the movies after so I was not \"fancy \" to do cute tourist like selfie scorpion shots ....  My biggest pet peeve when dining is being left thirsty .. I need soda usually diet or water and refills often lol my server failed from the jump with that.. I had asked some questions about the premium margaritas .. He didn't really say much but the jalapeño is too spicy for him so  I got this cucumber chili one he recommended which wasn't on the menu but he told me about and my guy got a raspberry one both of which were tasty imo for the 11/12$ price tag but the service went all bad when Shawn left to get those without asking if I need water but also having to be prompted to get some .. Worst thing is he not only brought our margaritas before the water that was requested but we had to ask for the water again and I continually saw him walking around talking to other co workers .. Being friendly ..I'm sorry he can love his co workers but service should prevail especially when I need water ..  He didn't recommend stuff and I had to do the digging and just responded we don't have it anymore so it got old for me really fast .. Now when date night occurs I typically go for app, two entrees and dessert plus booze  .. This situation already had  gone downhill fast ... It gous to one entree (maybe Shawn thought due to my attire I wasn't interested in spending money ) here is the thing usually I still eat my food and spend my money but I escalate the issue .. However being on a date and having my guy prefer to not make a scene I went another route which is not order stuff to lower my tab which helps make me feel less horrible for not tipping well but it leaves me to where I'm hangry and upset ..  If you do go here check in  on yelp and you'll get a free house margarita.. It was delicious  so I may go back to the bar sometime but..   Be advised I only got that free margarita to make sure he knew I was checked in but also cause I thought maybe the manager or supervisor would have to authorize it and come by cause I don't usually do top shelf so if I give it a thumbs up So it's  fair to say they have a good bartender   Filet nachos won the entree choice due to recommendation of the dude who seated us that was nice... They are 18 something and huge so we shared those fine but it was lack meat and had way too many beans but the taste was good ... Those beans are where Shawn and I went to the point of no return cause I was going to try another premium margarita and let my guy get his dessert but ..My  meal ended with my boyfriend and I waiting so long for Shawn to check back that the excessive beans on our nachos that had no meat were spread out on the dish and Shawn comes up and says \"are you done playing with your beans? Which   A. I guess if we had aligned and related that would of been cute but we didn't  B. You see it not eaten and don't ask what happened or how everything was. C. You had enough time to watch , lurk but not check in..  My boyfriend really wanted to try the churro banana split  but he had to make due with Ben and Jerrys at redrock.. Why? Cause I couldn't handle Shawn or the sight of beans any longer..it also delayed my finding good movie seats so thanks Shawn you win!! But seriously   Overall this was just not a good experience but the quality of food was not bad it was meh .."}
{"text":"I did like coming here, if you love nachos like me come here but prefer to pay a premium like $5 dollars more compared to the hole in the wall.  We did a Yelp check in and got a free margarita and a choice of on the rocks or frozen.  They are not cheap on the alcohol though as they put in quite a bit as it was too strong for me.  We order the filet mignon nachos for $20 dollars and they do give you quite a bit and we shared.  They do have happy hour, but they did not tell us about it until we saw the pork rinds for $4 dollars and decided to order that and wished we saw the menu first before ordering.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Mom and I are driving from her home in Connecticut to mine in LA, and we landed here en route on our last overnight. Nacho Daddy was a 30 second walk from our hotel. Checked out the menu online to see if there was anything for my vegetarian mother to eat. A vegan menu with actually tasty-sounding items? Sweet!  We were greeted and seated immediately by a hostess. Our awesome server Nick took care of us, including making sure my food had no tomatoes. This is really important for me, as I have a food sensitivity to raw tomatoes. I had the chicken fajitas, which were delicious and not greasy at all. Loved the addition of scallions. The rice was tasty; refried beans actually tasted of kidney beans for a change. Mom's vegetarian burrito with a veggie patty, black beans, rice and lots of vegetables was also amazing and proved too much for my mom to finish. As a vegetarian, she was impressed that thought had been given to making a great-tasting dish that wasn't an afterthought.  Beer for me and wine for mom -- good selection for both. There's a tasting option for craft ales at 60¢/oz on a $10 prepay tab, but it was more beer than I could handle!  I'll be back next time I'm in the area. Nothing to fault, and a lot to like."}
{"text":"I make better nachos drunk in my bathtub. Cool music videos, though. Decent location."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for late night munchies and we weren't disappointed. Our server Arnold was really chill. (thank you!!) The portions are really big so I'd recommend sharing one nacho plate for 2 people, unless you're really hungry. PS: THE RICE IS TO DIE FOR. It came as a side for the enchiladas. But you can order a side for $3. Do it. Bomb af. Also, don't forget to Yelp check in for free margarita!"}
{"text":"I was back in Vegas and decided to give this place a second chance because the food was so good. As we were seated, we told the host (who turned out to be the assistant manager) about our first experience. We had excellent service and the fiesta nachos, quesadilla and fried ice cream were amazing!! I just wish there was a Nacho Daddy in Cali :)"}
{"text":"First time at Nacho Daddy's, had the tostada style nachos. I highly recommend them, they were Delicious!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp we found this quick Nacho and margarita place that's slightly off of the main strip. We got to sit outside and enjoy some sun.  I split an order of Fiesta Nachos which were delicious! They came out on a hot plate and a huge pile of chips and topped with cheesy goodness. Some of the best nachos I've had. Somehow the chips magically stayed intact under all the toppings without breaking into tiny pieces. The best part was that the prices weren't crazy high like everywhere else we went and the portions were hearty. I left full and happy!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Had the best blueberry margarita and avocado tacos! Everything was amazing, especially our server Hazel! 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is always good. Have eaten here over 9 times in the last 4 months. Almost anything you could want on Nachos is available. Ryan is an awesome server, she is friendly and cute as a button!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Delicious nachos,  great server! In a town with celebrity chefs and amazing restaurants,  a downhome, relaxed environment."}
{"text":"Had the pitchers of margarita and the filet mignon nachos  Notthing was over the top fabulous but it was decent and fed three of us for about sixty bucks total  Watched the sharks hockey game on all their TVs   We came here after seeing MJ Live at the stratosphere and that was fantastic  We could walk to,our hotel on a gorgeous balmy warm night at 10 pm"}
{"text":"Awesome experience zach was great constantly checked in on us. Made sure we were fine the whole time. Wanna come back."}
{"text":"I have come back to this place a few times since my review for this place and here's what I think of it now: (by the way, this review is just based on the food and not the service.  The service is good and friendly). 1.  I really like it when Mexican restaurants offer free chips and dip, sadly this place does not. 2.  The last time we were here, the food was medicore... Here's what I mean by that:  the rice and beans tasted and looked like it's been sitting out for some time.  You know, when it looks all dry and burnt on the edges... You see it at times at a buffet when the food has been sitting out all day.. That's what it looked like.  3. This is what my bf calls this place: it's kinda harsh though... It's a wanna be Mexican restaurant.  He says the food doesn't taste authentic, and the price doesn't match the quality of food. *I really want to see this place succeed because they do offer vegan options which I love... but maybe with a few of these changes, they will have more people in the door."}
{"text":"Make reservations if you can; this place fills up!   It's located a little off Las Vegas Blvd, on Harmon. Free margarita with Yelp check in!   5 of us got 3 different nachos: Filet Mignon, Fiesta, and BBQ Chicken, and 1 person got Chicken Fajitas. Between 5 of us, we were barely able to finish 3 of the nacho orders... they were HUGE! Affordably priced (for anything on the strip), and delicious. Great place to watch any games going on, as they have a lot of sports screens up all around the restaurant. They are known for their scorpion shot and even have a scorpion tank up front.   Nachos had a great ratio of chip to toppings. They advertise \"never a dry chip\", and that was completely accurate. The group favorites were between the BBQ Chicken and the Filet Mignon nachos. Both were loaded with toppings and also were pretty different from each other. There are quite a bit of varieties to choose from. They even have dessert nachos!  Great sports bar atmosphere; nice break from the frenzy of the strip."}
{"text":"Was great! Even chips and salsa alone were to die for. Free margarita with Yelp check in was awesome, and strong enough. Will definitely visit from here on out when we come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Food is okay but service keeps getting worse. Tonight was the tipping point. I won't be back. Hostess and wait staff don't listen to what you want. I'm tired of having my dinners ruined by the restaurant."}
{"text":"The customer service is awesome!!! They are the best food and service!!! They will always get my business.. Teresa was awesome !!!!!"}
{"text":"Omgah. The nachos were bomb.  The atmosphere was awesome, they played great music from my generation. And the nachos were bomb!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! My bf and I ordered the Fiesta Nachos and a Daddy's bowl, expecting it to be just enough and not filling. To our surprise, the nachos alone were a huge portion and enough for both of us to leave feeling stuffed. We only had 3 bites of the Daddy's bowl and took the rest to-go. We also took advantage of the free house margaritas when we check in on Yelp. Our server (who we unfortunately forgot the name of) was also very friendly and attentive. Overall, we had a great experience here and will be returning the next time we're in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy has added a vegan menu and it's A-mazing! Our last experience was mediocre and it didn't encourage us to return anytime soon but once I learned of their vegan menu through Instagram pages I follow, I decided to try them out and so happy I Did!  We stopped in on a Thursday evening for HH for me to try out their vegan and my Bf ordered their chicken wings (he's not vegan) and they offer a $5 vegan nachos on their HH menu. It was fantastic. The cheese, sour cream was great. I wanted to try more but with the nachos and margaritas I was full. BUT I did manage to squeeze in their vegan chocolate cake with raspberries and it was oh so good! The chicken wings were very large and my bf said they were great.  So happy we came back bc we'll be back for sure. The bar service was great and they even were doing $5 1942 shots for I believe NFL and Golden Knights games so check them out!"}
{"text":"The sliders are my favorite. They blow White Castle out the water. The nachos are pretty good also!"}
{"text":"We recently moved back to Vegas and we have a Nacho Daddy down the street.  Since we love Nacho's we tried this place.  They had a March special which is an Irish potato nachos, which my husband wanted, I was more skeptical.  They were awesome!  Homemade fried potato chips with corn beef and yummy sauces!  Highly recommend!  Will go back.  Got my free margarita through Yelp as well! Yum!"}
{"text":"Went to the Sahara location for happy hour. The menu was extremely limited which sucked. Weird combo nachos. Out of the list, we ordered the vegan nachos and they were terrible. The bar server was also terrible, extremely slow and didn't check in frequently. There were barely anyone at the bar. Pretty disappointing since I have been to the Henderson location and the service and food was great so I was pretty disappointed at my local Nacho Daddy's location. Definitely won't return."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this hip mexican spot on Yelp as we were hungry after a 5 hour flight.....  The chips and salsa although 3 bucks are a great buy......  Now on to my fajita steak and cheese sandwich,the steak and onions were all cooked to perfection and the melted cheese was a great touch. The meal comes with fries and for a dollar more you can have garlic fries which I opted out of due to not wanting to deal with my own garlic breath.  My fiance ordered the open chicken tamale that comes with refried beans and rice which I had a bite of and to my surprise taste like a typical chicken tamale nothing special just not my cup of tea.  Overall the place was well kept with thee exception of the baby bird flying around. Our waiter was a bit slow but very polite.  And if you can please try the house Margarita it was the best Margarita I've had in a while."}
{"text":"This place has a \"catchy\" name, but at least the food isn't lame. The place has ridiculously high ceilings which makes you wonder why they aren't using the square footage to its potential-hello-put in a second level. Anyway, my boyfriend got the street tacos-there were three of them and he said the meat was flavored well. I had the fajita salad which came in. Large tostada bowl. It had Mexican rice, sour cream, cheese, peppers and onions, lettuce, beans, and some tasty grilled chicken. It was more than I could eat, but I was surprised at the good flavors. This place is right off the strip. Convenient location. Oh, the house margarita is pretty good too. I was pleasantly surprised by this find. They did Mexican right!  Btw the menu was too large to take pics of and I was too hungry to take them."}
{"text":"Delicious! Ordered the spicy shrimp nachos and spicy cucumber margarita.  Waiters were nice as well!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place and we are so glad we did. The food was fresh and delicious and the margaritas were great too. We had 2 different nacho dishes and the wings. The wings were some of the best I've had. The chef came to our table and asked us to sample a new sauce that wasn't on the menu yet for the wings. It was fantastic. The service was great as well."}
{"text":"Poor service across the board. Ate here 2x to take my client out for lunch and dinner and the server never came by except for food order. The hostess he sat me to our drink order not the waitress and waitress never checked on us for refill or how food was. I saw numerous groups sit down and leave because they never got served. Horrible place for service. Food is always good but don't expect much from staff."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy once again did not disappoint! The service is exceptional, Supervisor Gio takes his time to greet return guests and makes them feel like VIPs. He is a huge asset to the restaurant. Serena, our server, was very attentive making sure we were well taken care of. You can tell the staff enjoys their jobs! The nachos, we ordered 5 different kinds, were delicious! Highly recommend Nacho Daddy for a fun night out. Can't wait to see you all again real soon!"}
{"text":"Thought this place was excellent!  I can't believe it wasn't busier because the food and service were both terrific.  I guess it's because they are about 100 yards off the strip; sort of at the corner of Harmon and Las Vegas Blvd by Buffalo Wild Wings.  We had a hard time finding it because the signs at the Miracle Mile shop showed it right by the Paris hotel but that is not correct.  The skinny margaritas we had were $12 each but very large and tasty.  The shrimp fajitas for two was huge and yummy.  The naked wings were also good and my 'Daddy Bowl' with quinoa and chicken was superb.  All of this food was high quality, reasonably priced and our server Jovanny was super friendly and attentive without being invasive.  Two drinks, an appetizer, shrimp fajitas for two, and the daddy bowl came to $77 after tax excluding tip.  I'd recommend this place to anyone and think if it had a location on the Strip, like where the not nearly as good Cabo Wabo is it'd be an hour wait for a table."}
{"text":"What a great place. And how can you go wrong with Nachos? They even have a self-service Craft Beer dispenser. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I wish there was one where I lived. I guess for now I'll have to enjoy Nacho Daddy when I visit the in-laws."}
{"text":"Loved being able to eat vegan In Vegas! Sat at the bar and loved our server, Arnold, he was the best! Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick no frills lunch with some friends. For the four of us, we ordered the Vegas knights nachos, fish taco and some wings. Everything we had was really good. I especially enjoyed their nachos as it had a lot of great toppings including jalapeños steak and guacamole. I just thought it was a little pricey for 20 bucks. The portion is big if only one person was eating it but we all shared so I also wished it was larger.   The wings were very crispy and juicy. They were Sauceless but it comes with a side of ranch or blue cheese. I loved it because who doesn't like fried chicken??   The fish tacos we had were good but nothing super special. I think if you come here definitely stick to what they are known for... the nachos!  That was our favorite thing and I'll definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went in at 1 am and Cerah was our server. I ordered the Mexican corn on the cob and my friends ordered chicken quesadillas and the endless chips and salsa. My Mexican corn on the cob was fantastic. It was a small appetizer portion, so I ordered myself a chicken quesadilla as well. The best quesadilla I've ever had in my life. Great service by Cerah, and fantastic experience overall. We were very happy and will be back."}
{"text":"The free house margarita when you check in is really good! The decor is cute! I like the big cozy chairs by the fire place. The fillet mignon nachos and fajitas are really tasty. The service wasn't great! I had to keep asking for a refill or more chips and our server just seemed annoyed to be at work. She ended up taking a lunch break and it took a while to get the check. In total we were there 2 hours. Not sure if I'd come back."}
{"text":"Really good place. Can't remember what exactly I had but it was nachos and I love nachos. Will be returning."}
{"text":"If you like mediocre, expensive nachos coupled with. Super slow service this is your place."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and loved it! Our waiter Matt was amazing. Their spicy shrimp nachos is the best! And if your looking for a refreshing and delicious margarita get the spicy cucumber margarita."}
{"text":"I came here with my family got there and was seated right away which was great. Then I got some menus and proceeded to wait 25 minutes. Nobody stopped by I didn't even get courtesy water offered to us. One star from me."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, LEGIT nachos, and the biggest dam tv I have ever seen.  Great service. Overall, a quality MNF at Nacho Daddy,  the free check in margarita was an added bonus."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate there yesterday and shared the Buffalo Hot Nachos and a Chimichanga.  Food: I'm-content-good, but not knock-your-socks-off good.  Portions: on the large side.  Service: good - our waiter was straightforward and checked in on us an appropriate amount of times.  Speed: fine - we were sat down within 5-10 minutes, and the food came in about 10 minutes.  Price: Entrees were around $12-20. I thought this was a little pricey for what you're getting. If things were priced $8-14, I would feel happier and this would be a go-to place for me. At $12-20, it was good enough where I'm happy I tried it, but don't really see myself rushing to go back any time soon (Not that there aren't places at $12-20 I do rush to go back to; eg. Carson's Kitchen, Lotus of Siam)."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan, and wouldn't recommend eating there. My opinion of Nacho Daddy is basically the same opinion I have of many chains. It's not that the food is bad. It's just... not particularly _good_. It's also that the food is always overpriced.  If the world offered nothing but these chains, I would eat out occasionally. But in the world we live in, there are better options. Why settle? I would recommend Viva Mercados in the shopping center right next door or Apache Tacos right down the street over Nacho Daddy.  Edit: Business owner - now that you mention it, I remember last time being there, I don't like tomatoes so I asked if there are any tomatoes in the guac. The bartender told me \"yes\". I asked if they could make mine without tomatoes. I was told that the guac is all premade. I mentioned that guac could be as simple as mashing up some avocado, lime and salt, but they still weren't able to make me that guac. Instead I was offered to just have some cut up avocado, which I had to pay extra for. That experience makes me skeptical about your claim of \"fresh ingredients\" and things being \"made in house\"."}
{"text":"Got the \"Nacho Average Burger Nacho\" and it was really good. Plenty of interesting nacho combinations and plenty of Gluten Free options!"}
{"text":"The food is really good. They have a lot of choices for meats. The enchiladas are pretty good. Nachos are delicious! The service sucks. Had my drink go empty twice for more then 5 minutes each time. The waiter kept disappearing. Overall the food is good but the service makes it not that worth it."}
{"text":"This place is great. Loved the nachos. Tacos. And main course. Staff are very nice. Place is clean on the inside."}
{"text":"I always have great service and great food from nacho daddy. I love that they have so many options, including vegan!"}
{"text":"OMG THE FOOD WAS TERRIBLE. No taste, it was super bland. On top of that it took forever to order even though they weren't that packed.   We kept having to track down our server and having breakfast here took way longer than it should have. I would not recommend this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"First time visiting, and we will definitely be back!! The atmosphere is incredibly fun, food is delicious, and customer service is exceptional! Laekyn we one of the best servers I have ever come across!  WORTH EVERY STAR!!!"}
{"text":"Our second time eating here. Promptly seated. Waitress took order and margaritas were out in minutes. Enchiladas were awesome. My boyfriend got the supreme nachos. All was excellent. Happy hour specials were a nice bonus. Waitress was very nice. Restaurant very clean. Over all A+. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here with a two of my coworkers during our work trip and thought to try this place out since everywhere was booked (It was valentines day).  We made reservations and when we got here, the place was pretty dead (that was a hint) and then we got seated in about five minutes.  We had requested a booth from the supervisor on site and he said we will be getting one but when the host seated us, she didnt give us a booth until we asked  again.  Their communication was not all that great.    Guest 1 - Spicy Cucumber Margarita, Lobster Tail Tacos (Drink made me sick) My first round of spicy cucumber margarita tasted like sweet juice.  i even ate the jalapenos and they tasted like green pepper......  The second round I tried it and it was almost like the first round's spicy japaleno was forgotten on the first drink, and doubled on the second.  It made my stomach hurt and i have never experienced that before in my many spicy margaritas.  Then my food came out and the presentation was very nice.  Things tasted great but I felt like the lobster tail was very minimal.  I was not impressed at all.  Definitely overpriced for it.    Guest 2 - White Peach Margarita, Chicken Fajitas (food made her sick) FIrst round of white peach margaritas tasted very well, but the second round was so sweet, my coworker could not drink it.  Her food presentation was very nice but she said after her first taco, her stomach started to hurt. She barely finished her food... was not full nor buzzed.    Guest 3 - Malibu bay breeze, shrimp fajitas First round of her drink was very good, in a tall glass cup. Her second was downsized to HALF the size.  Her food was not cooked right and we're not sure what made her stomach hurt but even the next morning after, she was not feeling it.    I will spare you the lack of service from our waitress who I felt like kept on kicking us out (it was very dead, and we were there for less than an hour)   IN SUMMARY - We ALL got different food and we ALL got sick."}
{"text":"Nacho lovers gather here!  The menu is definitely dedicated to the different styles and types of nachos you can get. However they do have some other options like burritos and enchiladas to choose from.  We got a Daddy Margarita (basically a house marg) and a nacho supreme with beef. The nachos were pretty good, decent sized for $19. You do have to order chips and salsa separate for $3 if you're wanting some.   The service was meh. I felt like it took a long time and was a definite buzzkill to the frozen daiquiri I drank before.  Inside is cool - lots of different decorations like old bookshelves, western decor & much more.  Nacho Daddy is located right next to the new Buffalo Wild Wings outside and around the corner from Planet Hollywood.  Check in on Yelp to get a free house margarita!"}
{"text":"Mexi-Cobb salad is delicious. Seafood nachos were on point. Scorpion shorts provided much entertainment. Our waitress Taylor was awesome. Overall great stop on the strip."}
{"text":"This review is based on the only time that I've been to this restaurant. The staff seemed to be overwhelmed and unorganized. Even the manager didn't seem to have it together. I started to feel concerned about what the food would be like. It look a very long time to get our meals and drinks. The food was actually very good. We were all pleasantly surprised. With that said, if you're not in a hurry and you don't mind spending two hours here then give it a try."}
{"text":"After throwing up after a terrible hangover from a night of partying in Vegas - We finally went back to the strip and tried out Nacho Daddy!   Not a crazy fan of mexican food I was pretty amazed that I finished 2 Vegan Chicken tacos all by myself and it was actually extremely flavorful!  One of the best part about Nacho Daddy is that they have a band playing from different time slots and a extremely cool Scorpion tank when you walk into the restaurant. I was even fortunate enough to see a scorpion devour a cricket right before my eyes! It was oddly satisfying !"}
{"text":"This place has the best Mexican food in Vegas. DJ was our server tonight, he did a fabulous job. He provided us with extra rice with our chicken fajitas, was quick to refill our drinks, and had a good attitude. They also have a fun scorpion exhibit with live moving scorpions, you can even get a SHOT with a scorpion. Overall, a good pick when looking to try something different, would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"After watching the show Tanked and I had to go take a scorpion shot! Food was phenomenal I can confidently say I will be returning . Great Service , quality drinks , lovely people."}
{"text":"Jacob is the best waiter I have ever had. He's friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Nacho Daddy has a good down to earth vibe. The music is actually good and not boring top 40. I loved this place so much I went two weekends in a row and plan to go for a third weekend. This place is extremely vegan friendly but they have plenty of non vegan options. I fully recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Cons - guac is meh.  Pros - literally everything else rocks here! Service is A+. Free house margarita w/Yelp check-in? Score! (Really good margarita, too - def didn't skimp on alcohol or flavor). Enchilada combo was A-MAZING. Seriously, so so good, and HUGE.   Price wasn't bad, reasonable for the Strip (pricey for anywhere else, but we're not anywhere else so no complaints here).  I knocked a star off bc guac is Mexican 101 - but it was honestly a tough call bc everything else about my visit was stellar.  Oh, did I mention they donate 1 meal to a child in need for every meal they sell?? Bumped up a star for being a restaurant with a heart."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We got the 4 cheese nachos, enchiladas, 2 house margaritas, and the churro ice cream. Everything was absolutely delicious, but clearly you go here for the nachos. While the enchiladas were pretty good, the nachos were out of this world!"}
{"text":"I have experienced an amazing customer service by bartender DAVOR, very professional, knowledgeable about all kind if drinks, very nice an friendly. I will definitely come back with my family and strongly recomending to others to experience the same. Amazing job Davor !!! Keep it up."}
{"text":"Meh.   I've been to the Downtown location and this one. And for some reason, this one is just not as good.   I will point out, the bartender was awesome. She was so nice and so helpful. She was quick to fill our drinks and to bring us our food.   We got there 1 hour and 15 minutes before closing. We ordered quickly and we didn't stay past closing. Before they closed, they started turning off lights. That to me is a sign to \"Hurry up and get the fuck out\". I get it and I work in customer service. But, I don't care if it's before closing time, you should never turn off the lights when you have clients in there. Even if they're in there past closing time. It's super rude and very unprofessional. Even the bartender apologized and said how rude it was.   The food was just \"ok\". I don't know, maybe they were having an off night or they were just pissed because we came in an hour before closing. We ordered a few things and everything seemed slapped together and just not very flavorful.   I would love to give this place the benefit of the doubt because the one downtown is awesome.   Either way, I'm not so sure I'll be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Great food and such a cool atmosphere. Arieanna was a wonderful waitress and always made sure we were doing ok. Loved it!"}
{"text":"They have a separate vegan menu and items are marked as gluten free, vegetarian or vegan. The vegan nachos and vegan kale salad are really great. Get them. You won't regret it. I would have rated the restaurant higher but for the egg shell found in the huevo rancheros."}
{"text":"When you're on the Las Vegas Strip and someone says they want nachos - where do you go?  Nacho Daddy.  I'd never been to a nacho themed restaurant before. 10+ nacho varietals is pretty unusual - everything from traditional to buffalo/ranch. There's even a gluten free section of the menu!   I would not recommend the tacos. Stick with the nachos and a beer or margarita. Safe and easy. Even on a busy night it's pretty hard to mess up that order.   Definitely not fancy. Definitely not classy. Definitely good enough."}
{"text":"It was good but had more salt then what I like. The customer service was good and fast."}
{"text":"This place is great. Super big portions for sharing. One plate of nachos is plenty got two or three! Amazing"}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick lunch. The vegan food is not that good (cheeze). Some of the servers are nice, others are generally indifferent. My favoite dish is the cheese enchilada dish (half green, half red sauce). I wouldn't make a night out of it, more of a stop-by place"}
{"text":"We came for lunch on a Wednesday, not crowded at all, which was nice.  Used the free house Margarita for 'checking in\"...our server AJ was awesome and very helpful.  The food was good and the portions were just right.  The salsa was really good (lots of cilantro...I happen to like lots of cilantro).   The only issue that we had was that the music was a little loud, there were times it was difficult to hear exactly what our server (AJ) was saying."}
{"text":"I came here too full to want to live, but I couldn't leave Vegas without trying Nacho Daddy. I broke my POS FitBit here (RIP), but I ain't even mad.   They were packed on a Saturday night with a 40min wait for two, but my girlfriend and I managed a seat at the bar. We just ordered the vegan nachos and got a free margarita with Yelp check-in. They were probably the best vegan nachos I've had (or a close second to a place called Chive in Michigan), and would fool most anybody who didn't know better. It was also probably the first time I had nachos where there were more toppings than chips -- good shit.   I can't say much more about Nacho Daddy since I wasn't there long and didn't order much, but based on *just* the nachos... this place is p r i m o.   RIP FitBit."}
{"text":"Always great service and the absolute best place for vegan mexican food.  This is a must visit place everytime we come to Vegas.  New strip location is perfect if you don't want to travel downtown."}
{"text":"I ordered the buffalo chicken nachos. The taste was really good but the chicken was hard and tasted old. Wouldn't recommend- seemed really expensive for some chips and a few pieces of stale chicken."}
{"text":"Went to their grand opening event last night 11/24. This place went all out for the public..  Service was friendly and on spot.  Chicken and steak street tacos were awesome.   Ribs were well flavored.  Chicken wings were awesome.  Tuna tartar bites were on point.   Margaritas were excellent...delicious and just enough zing.  Midori sour shooters? Bring em on.  Quite a nice grand opening...and the 3 salsas were excellent as well as the guacamole. Left stuffed, satisfied and will be back.   I'll keep a look out for some happy hour special deals as the food was excellent. I'm glad a place like that is so close...definitely check them out. I see why people talked them up downtown."}
{"text":"We went in the restaurant a while back...I had my 94 year old Mother with me...the place was not busy...the staff was busy chatting....when I asked about a table they said give us a few minutes...after a few minutes I asked could I have my Mom sit down as I pointed at a table and was told there is no server for that area...I stated I only wanted her to have a seat while we waited...and then I proceeded to ask could we sit at this table and be served and was told NO... I was very surprised by the staffs reply and I said to my family...we need to leave here the staff is awfully rude....I told them how I felt and there was NO response to try and get us to reconsider staying..I find it very sad since I have enjoyed many a meal here...oh well...have a nice day..."}
{"text":"Delicious food...delicious drinks...great staff...a great twist of Mexican food...great appetizers too!"}
{"text":"I caved and ordered the buffalo chicken nachos because I'm a sucker for buffalo chicken. I don't recommend them. My friends got the supreme nacho and theirs was loaded with toppings! They also said they were the best nachos they've had! My didn't have much chicken and I had a lot of naked chips with nothing on them. We also got dessert; fried ice cream and churro sundae. Both were yummy! I look forward to coming back sometime and trying something else.  I also used the yelp check in to get the free margarita--thanks!!"}
{"text":"I love Nacho Daddy they have lots of Vegan options and I love the beer. I recommend you all come here."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast & service was amazing! The scorpions in the tank at the front of the restaurant are SO COOL.   Chips & salsa was pretty great. I love the option of mild & hot. Our waters were refilled every two minutes. I got a breakfast burrito with bacon on the side. It wasn't the best, but it was pretty damn good after a night of drinking. Huge portion of bacon on the side (5-6 pieces).   4 stars. I recommend & will be back for dinner."}
{"text":"DJ is the best!!! Awesome spot to get food in Vegas. Come here every year! Cool spot and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Nacho Daddy and had heard great things, but unfortunately it wasn't a great experience.   It wasn't busy when we arrived since it was early, so we got seated right away, which is always good. I started off ordering a blackberry margarita with a specific brand of tequila. The waiter brought out the non-alcoholic drinks and told me my margarita would be right out and he took our food order. There were three of us, so we got two types of nachos to share: the filet mignon nachos & the bbq pork nachos.   The margarita came out shortly after that, and was much redder that I would expect a blackberry margarita to be. Turned out it was a raspberry margarita (there were raspberries in it, and it was extremely tart). The waiter was no where to be found, so I had to wait quite some time before I could tell him.   Our food came out about 15-20 minutes later, and as the server put it down we saw that the bbq nachos didn't look like pork. They were actually chicken nachos. The server (not our waiter, probably a food runner) took the chicken nachos back to have them make pork. We started eating the filet mignon nachos, which were really good. As we were eating, a manager came over and asked if we wanted to eat the chicken nachos while we waited for the pork, and we said sure. The chicken nachos never made it back to our table. About the time we were finishing up the filet nachos, the bbq pork nachos came.   At about this time we finally saw our waiter (had to flag him down) and I told him I got the wrong margarita. He said he would order the blackberry. I got it shortly after that, but by this time we were almost finished eating. I did drink about half of it before we left and it was delicious.  It would have been nice if the waiter had checked back to see if everything was okay earlier so I could have had my drink with my food. Also, when a manager offers to let you eat the mistake while you wait for what you ordered, it would be great if they actually brought the food to you.   Food and drinks alone would get 4 stars, but throw in the horrible service and mistakes, I had to drop it down to a 2 star rating. I will likely not be going back."}
{"text":"Paid 15 bucks for \"sizzling shrimp tacos\" for delivery. They gave me a platter of shrimp with no tortillas and not even a fork to eat my incorrect order"}
{"text":"Fun place to eat.  Food and service have been good every time.  It can get a little noisy when it gets crowded, but everyone seems to be having a good time!  Great Margaritas!!"}
{"text":"Victoria was awesome, and Anthony is awesome too. I got the filet nachos and they were sooo good. Great atmosphere. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"This is a Vegas MUST VISIT restaurant! They have a scorpion tank in their entryway, an awesome greeter team, and uh- hello?? Freakin amazing nachos! This place can't get any cooler. My waitress, Amanda, was simply amazing. Extremely attentive and just candid and easy to interact with. Her recommendations were spot on. We had chips and guacamole for an appetizer (good for two people- order an extra if you have more than that), carne asada and the nacho average burger nachos (don't even try to share- get your own and eat the whole dang thing yourself. You deserve it. Hell, its Vegas! Be fat for a week). I was still recuperating from the previous night's drinks, so I didn't try their margaritas but I've heard they are to die for! Eat here! There's nothing else I can say. You have to experience this place for yourself. Oh! Almost forgot- this place is great for vegans! I'm a meat-eater, but thought it was pretty cool they had so many vegan options. The whole world needs to eat here."}
{"text":"Fun place with excellent food, a great selection and great service. I came here on a whim, without knowing what I was getting myself into, but wasn't disappointed. I had the corn and the Vegas Knights special. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Ari best waitress ever! The tacos were amazing! Very helpful and nice. Knowledgeable about different liquors and which would go great with our tacos for Taco Tuesday !"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit to Nacho Daddy and as usual the service was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable. We got the sloppy Joe nachos this time. They were tasty but due to the wetness of the sloppy Joe meat the chips get soft. We had the supreme nachos the first time and I'd think I'd stick with them again. The guac was creamy and tasty and fresh. The naked grilled wings are really tasty. They don't need the buffalo sauce that comes with them. They are good just the way they come to the table. Be sure to check in on Yelp and get your free margarita. Free and tasty makes it a bonus!"}
{"text":"I didn't stay long because I was in a hurry but the from the 5 star rating you can tell that I really enjoyed this place. I was visiting Vegas with my friends and wanted to stop by a place that had offered large amounts of food for an affordable price.   Before I even get to anything I want to say that if you check in with yelp you'll get a free margarita with the purchase of an entree. They'll include the tax on the margarita in your final bill but you're still saving around $12.  The interior of the place is sports themed and they have large TV's hung everywhere around the facility, which is nice because I didn't want to miss the NBA playoffs while I was busy eating. The atmosphere is very nice and they'll also have some sports music playing in the background.  Now onto the food. The food is huge. HUGE. I shared a filet mignon nacho with my friend and we were both full from eating it. The nacho itself costs around $20 but you have to consider just how large the thing is.  Finally, the waiting staff were fantastic and always attended to us whenever we needed anything promptly.  If I come to Vegas again, I will definitely stop by Nacho Daddy."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Stumbled upon this place last night while on a mini vacation here in Vegas. Seated fairly quickly on a Friday night and our server was awesome. I believe he said his name was DJ. Super fun with great energy and very attentive. They have a humongous TV that plays music videos, which made the experience even better.   The food was great. A little pricey for nachos, but 1. It's Vegas & 2. The portion size was very large - it fed my boyfriend and I and we took the left overs in a box to go. A worker asked US if we would like an extra side of fresh guacamole and didn't charge for it. I thought that was pretty awesome. Over all amazing experience, great service, delicious food. Will definitely be returning next time were in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Gabby is so friendly and courteous! She is very nice and caters to you like a friend! Ask for her and she get you the best deals! Will for sure come back and ask for her!"}
{"text":"The last time I went to Nacho Daddy is when their first location had just opened downtown.  The menu has definitely gotten bigger and better since then! I was definitely impressed. They have a great selection of gluten free/vegan options that sounded appetizing. And a lot of non-gluten free/vegan options for those of you who don't worry about that kinda stuff.  We were just a party of 3, my friend, my son and I. We were seated rather quickly in a big booth. Kayla was our server and brought us menus. She was absolutely wonderful from start to finish! I know we've all been out to places where the server was less than pleasant.. It really puts a damper on things. This was totally not the case with Kayla- or any of the employees. Even the guy who bought us our food and the lovely gal who was clearing our table. I'm getting ahead of myself though.  Kayla made sure we knew what Nacho Daddy was all about before leaving us to browse the menus. T Money ordered off of the kids menu- 2 plain patties Lliterally, plain.. No cheese. No bun. Nada. Zip. Zilch. Zero..) and fries. I appreciated she didn't think I was a total weirdo ordering that for my kid and she let me know I wasn't the only parent that had to do that. We had a good laugh- I seriously appreciated that because sometimes I get a weird look ordering that. I wasn't too hungry, so my friend and I ordered the trio of dips with fresh tortilla chips- Queso, guac and salsa. My friend ordered two tacos on the flour tortillas sans sides. I also ordered the Daddy margarita and a house margarita later on.   Everything was brought out surprisingly quick. My margarita(s) were great- not too sweet either, which is just the way I like it. The guac was awesome. It was fresh and chunky. I didn't taste the queso (dairy allergy) but my friend gave it the thumbs up. And they serve it with a little tea light underneath to keep it warm and flowing. T Money's patties were a decent size. You can tell they were hand-formed and were also pretty thick. His fries came out hot and super fresh. He is legitimately the fry king and he liked them a lot.   To be frank, I hadn't come back to Nacho Daddy after the first time because our first time kinda sucked. This more than made up for it- enough for me to want to come back and regularly frequent this joint. They have some great happy hour specials I'd like to try AND the loaded vegan/gluten free nachos look amaaaaaazing.  Much love and props to Kayla! Be sure to ask for her if you stop in and she'll take great care of you."}
{"text":"With BWW next door, you would be surprised to get far superior wings at a \"nacho\" restaurant. Get ready to be surprised, their wings were killer, along with the Chiliquilles   Our server, Allie, was attentive and friendly, I would definitely recommend this place. It is an excellent value, with great food and service!"}
{"text":"We were on the fence about where we wanted to go have dinner and thank goodness we picked this place.  I ordered the Tostada Nachos and my taste buds are STILL going crazy even 17 hours later. It was quite the treat. The portions are HUGE. I couldn't finish it so next time I will definitely be sharing it with someone else.   My boyfriend got the Shrimp & Lobster (maybe it was Crab) but he had a hard time getting himself to stop eating it. Lol he was so addicted! They gave him a free shot for his birthday.  It's a cool little place with so many different choices! Service was great, as well. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"After being severely overstimulated by everything that is the Vegas strip, nacho daddy came as a godsend and temporary relief from the cold. We went on a Sunday night, so not exactly the food rush, but the service was excellent! Ryan was the best, we loved chatting with her and she was really attentive to us! The Thai nachos were sublime. Super weird if you're a nacho traditionalist, but if you appreciate a walk on the wild side then definitely go for it! The fajita salad was a standard Mexican style salad, and an excellent way to add vegetables. Three of us shared these two entrees and bottomless chips and salsa, we all walked away full and extremely happy we chose to stop in!   Also, the margarita is incredible."}
{"text":"My friends and I were lured here by the Yelp check-in offer for a free margarita with an entrée purchase.  Unfortunately, the margarita was overwhelmingly sweet and sour mix.  Their sweet and sour is made in house and actually pretty good, but the margarita itself was not well made.  I know it was free, but if it was a true representation of their margaritas, I wouldn't get one here.  Aside from that, this is a good place to eat affordably on the strip.  It's part of the Miracle Mile Shops, but the entrance is located on the outside of the shops.  There's plenty of seating and TVs everywhere for watching whatever is on.    As the name suggests, they have a large variety of nachos to choose from.  I couldn't decide which one to get, so I chose the Burger Nachos ($13.50) because it had a star next to it.  It had everything a burger would normally have, but tasted a lot like a taco salad.  They weren't bad, but something I could easily put together at home.  I was more impressed by my friend's enchilada nachos.  It tasted just like enchiladas, but in nacho form.  It's a cool place to go with your friends and grab a casual bite.  Just don't get the house margarita."}
{"text":"I have been here twice while in Vegas. The location is convenient-it is adjacent to Planet Hollywood. I come here for the awesome vegan menu. The food is very good and so are the prices. The service is 3 stars, but I am rating 4 stars because of the vegan menu. On my first visit, the service was friendly, but slow, although the place was not crowded. On my second visit, it was crowded and the wait staff was busy. The service was even slower than the first time. The waitress never showed up to our table. Thankfully, another waiter saw the hungry look on our faces and realized that we had been waiting 20 minutes and had not even placed a drink order. The waiter that was not assigned to our table went out of his way to make sure that our orders were taken and that we got our food. Overall, I like the food and the atmosphere. I'm hoping for better service on my next visit."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas.  It was midnight. Yelp check-in for a free Margarita didn't hurt. :)  We ordered some special-of-the-day nachos and enjoyed them without being attended to too much. The way we faced, we watched the music videos on the gigantic screen, enjoyed our \"quiet\" booth, and couldn't drink the margarita..not tasty at all.(but it was free so I ain't complaining!)  Good place for late night food."}
{"text":"Ate here after walking through the entire miracle mile looking for something appetizing .  This is on the outside next to Buffalo Wild Wings .  I was prepared for crappy Mexican food and overpriced drinks , but I was highly surprised !  We got the bbq pork nachos and the guacamole which were both amazing .  Also got a frozen margarita that actually had good flavor and wasn't weak at all .  Our particular waitress was very attentive .    Something unexpected - as my wife has a very restricted diet , they have TONS of vegan options .  An added bonus for us !  Surprisingly , there prices are really reasonable for a restaurant on hen strip .    Nice atmosphere too!  Highly recommend ."}
{"text":"2nd time here in the same trip to Vegas. Awesome salsa and filet nachos! House Margs are great and if you check in via Yelp at certain times you get a free one!  Service can't be beat!"}

{"text":"We came here for happy hours, we got our order pretty quick, staff helpful, food is just ok, nothing to write home and/ or refer friends to try... I think I rather head elsewhere for happy hours, my cousin got sick the next day???? Lots of easy parking-pro"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. I decided to take a chance and try it out for the first time! I got there around noon and there was probably only two other parties there so it wasn't too busy. The super high ceilings and ample television screens made for a great atmosphere of industrial Meets modern Cantina! There's a self-serve beer bar and a photo booth JUST in case you needed something extra!!  On to the most important thing, the food, I legit have a new favorite place to get fajitas. Nacho Daddy's fajitas are flaming , LITERALLY, they light them on fire at your table!!! So fun. the selection of Beer was great and the peach Margarita my mom got was so good. Brent, our server was knowledgeable and helpful but not pushy. All in all it was an amazing time and we will definitely be back with friends."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Amazing vegan/dairy free options.  Vegan queso and margaritas were on point! Great atmosphere and music."}
{"text":"Went here for the very first time on New Year's night. The waiter and the entire staff were pleasantly nice. Our drinks were also made to perfection. I will be going back here again."}
{"text":"Asked for red enchiladas and chose hot but it was bland and taste like tomato sauce very disappointed"}
{"text":"Vegan/Vegetarian review: 4.5 stars             Eating vegan on the Vegas strip is not an easy feat. After shuffling through tons of eateries on the strip, Nacho Daddy seemed relatively centralized, appetizing, and decently priced. So I and a couple of meat eaters ventured over to the joint as it was my turn to pick a place where I had more to eat than a lousy salad and fries. Sure enough, Nacho Daddy provided an extensive vegan menu of nachos, burritos, tacos, enchiladas, quesadillas, fajitas, and salad bowls that left me at a lost as to what to pick from this massive list.  Not being a risk taker, we played it safe and got:  Vegan Chicken Nachos - 4.5/5         Traditionally loaded, with everything you could possibly think that would go on nachos, came on this dish... Protein (marinated chickn), beans, guac, pico de gallo, salsa, bell peppers, roasted corn, onions, mushrooms, and vegan queso with spinach chips (nothing special)         The chickn taste like store bought gardein strips. While not unique, I'm still grateful!  The cheeze is decent, and all the fixings were pretty good all together. It's nachos, so while it's easy to make delicious, it's hard to stand out!  As a vegan dish, the true test is the \"cheese\", and its flavor and texture. Although I knew it wasn't real cheese, it was still pretty tasty and a decent sized portion was given. My only ding is the lack luster vegan chicken.   Fillet Mignon Nachos (GF) - 3.5/5           A little less loaded on these guys... These house made standard tortilla chips are loaded with beef, refried beans, sour cream, ranchero sauce, guac, pico de gallo, and a mixture of cheese.           The meat eaters said that the fillet mignon pieces were scarce and a bit dry. They even admitted that the vegan chicken version looked more appetizing. XD But, they said theirs was still decent, because who doesn't like nachos!?  Haha  I had to go down in rating on their behalf, but stuck with the 5 stars for the massive vegan menu (despite not being a vegan place), not charging extra for the 'vegan' title, generous amount of food, and friendly service, although a bit slow.   I need you guys to be in business when I visit,  so 5 stars it is :D"}
{"text":"Great drinks and food, great service from Ryan. He was amazing,  definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Walked in with a friend on a Friday around 4 for happy hour.  Sat at the bar for over 5 minutes and not one person acknowledged us. The place was not busy at all.  One guy at the bar eating nachos and drinking a beer.  Another group of 6 at the table directly behind the bar area.  Have eaten here before and not overly impressed but was willing to give the happy hour a chance. Well with all things considered this is a \"NO\" for the future for any visits."}
{"text":"Vince was our server and he was a gem.  We started with guacamole cheese salsa and chips. Yummy. We ordered the Baja seafood enchilada with fish taco. It came with rice and beans. Nice. The margaritas were fine, but one was too sweet and one was too sour, but still good. We also had the fajitas which were flaming at the table. Nice and tasty. The music was a little too rap and loud for us old timers. We could barely finish the large portions. We had a good time and left full and happy."}
{"text":"Eh. Great reviews so we decided to give it a try. It was OK. Certainly nothing nothing to write home about. Will not go back. Waitress ignored us most of the time."}
{"text":"Yo, Nacho Daddy is the place to be on a Saturday evening! Our server DJ took good care of us. From the moment we sat down to the moment we left."}
{"text":"Holy AMAZING nachos!!! This place was an experience from the second you walk in. The décor keeps you looking around and in awe of all the fun murals they have on the wall. They have a menu full of all sorts of nachos that you wouldn't even think of in your dreams. We had the house special since it was our first time in and we polished our plate clean they were so good!! I will for sure be returning to try another nacho creation the next time I am in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"The All American Cheese Burger W/Cheddar Cheese not American Cheese and Garlic fires are so fricken good I have eaten them more than once.  Even home delivery from BiteSquad or something like that."}
{"text":"Dolla bill best waiter you could ask for! Good food good drinks. Will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night (6/23/18) and Xavier was our server.  The food was awesome, although the service was not.  He messed up my friends order, and was trying to be a comedian, although he wasnt funny but much better described as rude. I told him I was hot and if he could turn up the AC, he stood there and blew his breath to me saying he could cool me down. Believe me I was appauled.  I didnt complain because they were busy and I understood. But, how dare you!   I'm giving them 2 stars because the food was absolutely fantastic and if you check in they give you tasty margaritas. which by the way, YES they were awesome. I will be back just make sure he's not our server.    Food 5 stars,  Service negative 10 stars."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had a long day walking around and wanted to finally kick up our feet to relax. We decided to just walk down and see our options in the Miracle Mile we're. Nacho Daddy stood out because my friend had been raving about it since our last Vegas visiting. From the minute we walked in, everyone was so nice and helpful. The place has an open floor plan with tall ceilings and music loud, but I love that it was overpowering conversation. The menu was vast with so many surf, turf and vegan options I couldn't decide what to order. The first person to give me some warm feedback was Jovany. His honest opinions were so refreshing and ordered the Sizzling Shrimp Tacos without any hesitations. Then, he was delighted we were from OC and gave us two Nacho Daddy shot glasses on the house. Hello?! How awesome is it to connect with someone so real? Anyway, the strawberry margarita is stiff and good. I'm dancing my way out of here. Thanks so much for your hospitality, Jovany! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Jose was a great server! Good food and great service! Definitely worth checking out. I will definitely be coming backs to Nacho Daddy when I come back to Vegas. Thanks, Jose!!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. Really happy with the food and our server Judy. She gave us good recommendations. Atmosphere is like the typical Vegas atmosphere. Festive,  with a variety of music. Recommend for a casual lunch."}
{"text":"On New Years my and my partner decided to come to this restaurant and man I'm so happy I did . We were walking back to our hotel and was hungry and my eye just caught the sign that read \"scorpion shot\" and I wanted to try it right away , so we went in and order 3 shots with scorpions and took them towards the end of the meal. My partner ordered the shrimp nachos and I don't remember what I ordered but it was okay . I ate 3/4th of it. But the shot was amazing and consuming a scorpion was a 1st . I love it"}
{"text":"I can't explain how I feel every time I leave..... Oh yea I can satisfied and full!!!  My taste buds always explode with happiness every time I come here!!! I will always be coming back!!! Server jovanny was phenomenal and loved his service!!! Best server I've had in Vegas by far.   Loved this location to!!!"}
{"text":"Fab service! Jovany easily handled our group of 15 with a breeze. He got all our orders correct on the first shot, got our drink orders to us within minutes, and left us feeling like royalty.  Thanks for the great time, food, service, and friendly smiles :)"}
{"text":"Pretty interesting sport bar but very impressed with vegan options! Would recommend the vegan nachos for sure, but wasn't wowed by any of the other food. Service was also disappointing - our glasses were rarely refilled and we left pretty thirsty. Also found an eggshell in the huevos rancheros.   Would go back, but for nothing but he nachos."}
{"text":"Just tried Nacho Daddy for the first time. Nice size menu for Vegans which is super hard to in Vegas. Our server was AJ. He was super helpful and just made our experience here a million times better! The food was great, generous portion size for the price! Would recommend for sure. Nacho Daddy needs to come to LA/Long Beach Area :)"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect.  Had the breakfast taco, nachos and margarita.  Food and service was great, would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Been excited about coming here since ive moved here. Finally got to go and was so disappointed. The food was \"ok\" but the service was just  bad. Didnt see ANY server with name tag, So I'm not sure who our server was. But you could tell by the way she waited on , not just OUR table, but her other guests as well, she didnt wanna be there. Had to ask for refills. Took forever to get get food. And no, they werent busy. Finally got our food. And not once did she come by to ask of we needed anything... (We did)  But because we already had to ask for refills on our drinks and she never made eye contact with is. We just did without. The General  Manager did come by and asked how we were doing. He got us refills. My wife did mention the bad service we were getting and he just saod \" sorry\"  And brought our to go boxes. Then the server decided to come ask if we needed anything. At that point we just wanted the check so we could go. Spend $60 on ok food and bad service. We'll stick with Lindo Michoacan!"}
{"text":"Naked wings are everything!!!!! Margaritas were on point. Service was efficient. My go to every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent! The food was favorable,  portions were huge(plenty for later), the service was excellent. Most places do not have ground beef tacos anymore, therefore, I was soooo excited.  The drinks were a little pricey, but powerful. Great margaritas. It will be our spot for great Mexican food in Vegas. Will be recommending to friends and family."}
{"text":"We were seated outdoors and Jovany was extremely friendly and gave great service. Free margaritas with checkin! We got the filet mignon nachos because we were craving some bomb nachos."}
{"text":"Any time I'm back in Vegas I'm coming here. The food is amazing, great atmosphere, and great service."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the food being outstanding, this place would have only earned 2 stars- and that is being kind.  Service was less than desirable.  From the moment we walked in, to our server half heartedly greeting us, we thought this place was a big mistake.  Had to wait for a table to be cleared when there were plenty of empty tables. Confusing.  Our server threw straws at us when serving water.  Our food was delivered half-assed: we had to ask for the tortillas that accompanied fajitas and a plate for assembly.  WTF?  If you're planning on visiting, check out the FREE house margarita offer on Yelp to help dull the terrible service.  Remember: the food is great!!"}
{"text":"Wow after waiting 45 minutes since I made my order they come up to me that they didn't put my order in but they are fast and it will take 15 minutes. I hope the food is worth the wait cause this service sucks!!!  Update 1:05 minutes later order was wrong.  Finally got it and only thing that made it bearable was that it was comp. they forgot the corn on the cob but at this point I just wanted to get the heck out of here.   The GM did his best on a bad situation I give him credit. The damage was done but just because of how he handled the situation I'll try this place again. I'll wait until they get the \"new computer system\" has no more kinks"}
{"text":"Get the Supreme Tostada Nachos.  They are outstanding!  Never thought I would get filled up by a nacho platter, but this is the place to get your nachos."}
{"text":"I loved the restaurant, the food was fantastic and plentiful. Only issue I had with the food was that the fajitas aren't served with shredded cheese. I thought that was odd. I suppose I could've asked for some, but I didn't think about it at the time. The server was SLOW. Wow. So slow. It was Wednesday and they weren't very busy, and it looked like they had plenty of staff there, so I don't know what the deal was. Our drinks were never refreshed without us having to ask, and then WAIT again. Food came out hot and quickly after we ordered, so she wasn't waiting on the cooks/food.  I'd definitely go back, the entire menu looked amazing, but I'll make sure I get a different server."}
{"text":"This place is good, reasonably priced. They have an entire vegan section and GF options which is fantastic! Drinks were good and service was great. We had a great time at Nacho Daddy and were very pleased with the value we received for our money!"}
{"text":"Great place in Vegas for great food and good times. Service is off the charts with Gabby. Highly recommend stopping in and grabbing one of their famous scorpion shots or their margaritas. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I guess we should have got the nachos. We both got combo meals, the mojo pork tacos were good. The enchiladas, rice and beans tasted like Taco Bell.   The service was excellent though."}
{"text":"My friends and I visited this restaurant twice while in Las Vegas.  On the first occasion we stopped in to do the famous scorpion shot.  The shot of tequila went down easy and the scorpion was just crunchy.   The only problem we had was that you are supposed to be able to keep the glasses and we didn't know that.  On the second occasion we came back for dinner and everyone had a great meal!"}
{"text":"Definately my favorite lunch spot. Awesome food and great bartenders! Tara is amazing!! Very friendly and attentive. Street tacos and lobster nachos are a must try.. great happy hour specials as well."}
{"text":"My first time and was very impressed with the menu and the food, even had a Vegan menu. Guacamole was great with bottomless chips.  Our food server was great considering she was running ragged since it looked like they were very understaffed. But for the most part great place."}
{"text":"I gave Nacho Daddy a second try due being quite the nacho aficionado. I then realized the chips were less flavorful than my home nacho chips because they need to be. The structural integrity of the chip is superior to anything on the commercial grocery market and quite the feat of culinary engineering. Once I was able to embrace the positives rigid tortilla chip, I began to pile the toppings on: Spicy shrimp, ground beef, quac, chicken tenders, quesadilla, more chips, didn't matter, the base chip could hold it all. I was then able to enjoy the flavors presented on the chip and thoroughly enjoyed my second chance try at Nacho Daddy."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in from orange county and googled best Mexican restaurant in downtown Las Vegas came in had an awesome experience with Ariel she was the best  Great customer service and the food was great too Thank you Ariel!!!"}
{"text":"Had the best service tonight at nacho daddy! The food is very tasty,  so glad they had healthy options. Thank you,  Victoria for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Went here the other day With my boyfriend for lunch. It was good!! I had grilled fish tacos. It came with rice and beans. Great in flavor and huge portion. My boyfriend got the buffalo ranch nachos. He completely demolished it!! Waitress was friendly and kept an eye out on drinks and if we were enjoy ourselves. Even the manger checked up on us as well as other customers dining in. I guess my only complaint is that I bit into my taco and the avocado still had its shell on it. Good to know it was fresh but a surprise to chew into that. Other than that it was a pretty great experience and A+ in customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I only ordered a salad here at the bar alone, so my review is solely based on that. That being said the food was decent. The chicken was seasoned really nicely but everything else about it was average. I'm kind of a cheese snob so I expect a Mexican restaurant to not use cheddar on any of their dishes but that's just a personal preference. Maybe if they threw some queso fresco on their salad and I had a few of their margaritas I would be more in love with it.  Price wise it's a little expensive for what you get but considering it's a very touristy area I think they are priced about right.  The bar tender was very attentive, 5 stars for the service. My water was empty a lot, but between the combination of her being SUPER busy and me being SUPER thirsty, it's nothing to get upset over.  If I'm in town again I would maybe come back for a marg and an app, but nothing to write home about considering all the amazing restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm crossing my fingers that I got her name right... RYAN?!!! (The girl with the upper lip piercing?) lol. Thank you so much for your great service, you're definitely an asset to this restaurant.   The food was... Delicious! We got the enchilada nachos,chimichanga and beer battered fish tacos. This definitely hit the spot after a long night of liver damaging tequila shots. I'll definitely be back on my next trip to Vegas. Thank you Nacho Daddy!"}
{"text":"The nachos were average. Unfortunately our order was lost somehow, but they did comp some of our meal. The atmosphere makes for great people watching!"}
{"text":"Cool location and attentive bartenders. Really liked the appetizer (queso dip) and our friends loved their nachos but the drinks were way too sweet. I couldn't give the place 3 stars because I enjoyed our time there but I would have a hard time ordering anything but beer in the future."}
{"text":"I love this place ! It's awesome and I always enjoy the food. Never have any complaints ever ."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. If I could add a 6th star I would. Server was phenomenal . Management was great . Everyone was accommodating"}
{"text":"\"NAWT YO DADDY\" nacho daddy... hmm? It's the name of the restaurant that drew my family & I to this place, LOL! Until we saw reviews, we really wanted to check it out. Came here for lunch only to get their nachos to-go. We ordered 3 of their nachos to take back to our hotel for a party of 8.   * Ordered:  - Filet Mignon nachos (5/5 stars): As soon as we got our order & had to wait for our uber driver to pick us up.... we completely finished this entire box between 4 of us before uber even got to us! LOL! We had to order another box. The mixed fish, cheese, & salsa make this a good combo with chips.  - Seafood nachos (3/5 stars): This was our least favorite, but was still finished by the end of the day. I think the mango was too fresh that it didn't taste as well with the seafood & my cousin agreed.  - Fiesta nachos (4/5 stars): This was our 2nd favorite. Packed with meat, cheese, & colorful chips. Definitely looks like a fiesta in a box. There was a lot of meat in this one.  Missed out on the full sports bar & drinks but they do serve happy hour, gear, & games to participate to win in! All 3 boxes were good for a party of 8. Not a full entree, but good enough for a filling snack in between drinking throughout the day!"}
{"text":"Wow.... not pleased with this place... we came in about 1pm. Not only did we have to wait ( not busy at all ) they couldn't communicate with each other or us letting us know what is going on... then got seated to a wet table, then waited 5 min after gotten seated for the waiter to come and take our order... We ordered took 20 min for our food (not to bad) my boyfriend ordered a strawberry margarita... the manager made it cuz the 2 bartenders called off.. it was really thick was hard going down... then i asked for sour cream and the waiter didnt come back for over 10 min with it and by then i was done with the food.. never asked if i needed a refill of my tea.. i tryed asking her and next thing i know she is gone.. i have been in the food industry so i know people call off things happen but not like this... Thanks to the kitchen manager Ruben Garcia  came out and talked to us and we express our concern and what happend he was NOT happy... he took care of us made us feel we mattered.. and took care of the bill... tje food was great..."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant 3 times on my visit to Vegas.  I had a great experience on my first visit that I wrote them a fantastic review.  On my second visit I wanted to try their breakfast.  I am vegetarian and ordered the vegetarian omelet.  I was very specific with what I wanted and told my waitress, egg whites and no cheese.  Just like on my first visit I got my order with cheese.  This waitress did not say I'm sorry or anything and no smiles either. On my first visit my waitress was very apologetic and even took it out of our bill.  ...On my third visit I brought 2 other friends. Again I ordered breakfast, vegetarian omelet and was also specific, egg whites no cheese.   I again was given cheese on my eggs.  ...So here's my final follow up review, overall the food is great. It is on the greasy side but great food and great atmosphere.  Orders with specific changes however seem to get lost.  I wanted to give you 3 stars but because my first visit was so exceptional that I gave you the extra star."}
{"text":"Sat down excited to eat some nachos but after 20 mins of waiting just to be given some water and order taken, nothing happened. So we left and found food elsewhere"}
{"text":"I must say, I do not know why my fiancee and I waited soooo long to go here. We finally went on Tuesday afternoon around 2pm in the afternoon. Place is located on Harmon Ave. Right next door to the Hot N Juicy restaurant, and near the Miracle Mile shops. Surprisingly, place was not packed knowing that is on the Strip. You will be able to find parking, not unless you park in the Miracle Mile garage.   Cool little spot on the strip. You will not get much of this, but they have outside patio dining, inside with table top and booth seating. They even have souvenirs if you are dropping in from out of town.   We were seated right away, and given a huge menu to take a look at. Looking through the menu: they have awesome appetizers for sharing, entree, combination plates, desserts, long list of alcohol, and nachos galore. Of course, they are known mostly for their nachos, free margaritas if you check in on yelp, and their scorpion shots.   What we ordered: the triple dip appetizer (queso, salsa, and house made guacamole), filet mignon nachos, and the ultimate enchilada (comes with beans and rice). Wait time was perfect since we were hungry enough to order appetizers this time. If not, you may want to come when you are extremely hungry or craving good mexican food.  The appetizer, queso was evenly seasoned with the perfect amount of spice. Guacamole had good amount of lime, onion, and has been one of the best that I have tasted in awhile. Salsa, was good all around. Now, do not let the pictures fool you. The filet mignon nachos is good to share for two. But, I was able to finish by myself (this has never happened before)! Loved the chili, salsa white sauce guacamole and cheese mix. One bite to just a few more is not enough!! You will want to keep eating. The enchiladas filled up my fiancee and he eats big. Again, do not let the size fool you.  Unfortunately, so we were both full, we did not get to try the dessert. We will soon be back. Thanks Nacho Daddy for the awesome food, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy was PHENOMENAL! Wonderful customer service--the waitress was very knowledgeable about the vegan items on the menu. (They didn't even complain or rush our table when we stayed to chat an hour after our bill was paid!)  The food was so delicious! We ordered the guacamole, spicy burrito and beer-battered avocado tacos. Everything was extremely tasty. Even most of the margaritas are vegan! The bathrooms are very clean and nice. I LOVE the decor and set-up of the restaurant; they have books, art, and plenty of things to look at. The music was on point and it was so fun to watch sports and old music videos on the TV screens. We will be back soon with lots of company!"}
{"text":"I've heard so many great things about Nacho Daddy! it was a great place to take my omni friends and family. The customer service was wonderful! The food was pretty good, however; I was not a fan of the vegan nacho cheese. I will definitely be back to try other Vegan food items."}
{"text":"Amazing food but the worst service. They seated other before us after we waited. Then the server only gave us our drinks and we never saw here again. Couldn't even get another drink. We waited a long time before we saw someone walked by to ask for our check. We then saw our server basically sleeping at a table."}
{"text":"Great vegan food good portion size and amazing service the waiter was so friendly and informative best service iv probably ever had will for sure come back thanks AJ!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why but my cousin and I are obsessed with this place. I've ordered out, been to happy hour and had a sit down meal. All very good. They offer a vegan menu which is a huge plus and serve breakfast all day. I've had the apps, entrees, and of course NACHOS. Nachos are a must. Vegan grub is pretty awesome I hear as well.  This week I went there and sat out on the patio which was very comfortable and pleasant. Our waiter \"Nacho\" Nick was awesome. Very friendly and accommodating. Even though one of our requests wasn't on the menu he made it happen - score!  Until next time Nacho Daddy, so many items to choose from I have to keep coming back until I'm tasted them all."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Big Daddy Burrito with chicken and green sauce. Sauces $1 extra, burrito had too much rice and was difficult to eat with a fork. Rice and beans on one side, meat on other side of it. It would fall apart when you cut into it. Atmosphere would have been perfect if it hadn't been for the odd shows they had on the TV screens. One was a turtle eyeball being surgically worked on and the other was a show of idiots performing painful stunts and making fools of themselves. Definitely not what I wanted to watch while I ate.  We probably won't go back with there being so many other choices in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"We, Groupon it..The Reg-Margarita & The Blackberry Margarita Hit our tastes just fine! 3 Street Tacos #1 Fish.A+ #2 Pork.A #3 Filet-Failed! The Mexican Street Burger was the Best Burger I've had in a Long time and my Vote for the \"Best Burger\" in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My review is strictly regarding the food.  The service was quick and attentive and the balloon artist was amazing and really kept our kids entertained.  But we came here for the first and last time tonight and the reason was the food. One word: bland. Wait,  I need to add more adjectives.  How about boring,dull, uninspired and possibly canned? My daughter ordered the kids burrito.  It consisted of what tasted like canned refried beans wrapped in a tortilla.  Absolutely no cheese,  sauce or sour cream. Taco Bell makes a better bean burrito.  Crab and lobster enchilada was also bland and the seafood tasted frozen. The nachos were basic,  nothing to write home about.  I know my family's tastes may be more \"exotic\" but we went on a day when kids eat free and we still paid $70 for mediocre food. I don't mind paying $$ if the food is bomb. Our server noticed all the untouched food and asked if we needed boxes. We politely declined, seriously what was the point? If the food didn't taste good \"fresh \" it certainly wasn't going to taste better after being microwaved.  This food was not \"bomb \" by our standards and we're foodies. Oh, and the margaritas were tasty, but weak.  It's a shame,  we were celebrating a special occasion and left feeling robbed."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you, they aren't just nachos! But the nachos are definitely to die for! Super yummy food and drinks that are affordable. Music videos are a bonus! Manager, Johnny is the man. Great service. My hubs and I absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"Rare VEGAN oasis on the strip! Nacho Daddy is tucked away on Harmon just outside of the Miracle Mile shops with street/sidewalk access only (a little hard to find at first.) They have a separate vegan menu section and use Gardein chick'n product (optional) in their vegan quesadilla, fajitas, burrito and nachos. Kudos to Nacho Daddy for making their vegan cheese (cheddar style) in-house -- it was delicious. I had four meals here spanning my week in Vegas; thus, I tried several vegan meals, and all were delicious. I highly recommend the vegan burrito and vegan chick'n nachos (huge portion for $16.50). I like hot/spicy ... and be warned their hot salsa is definitely \"hot.\" On the downside, their is a large aquarium at the front entrance which houses large, disgusting black scorpions. Clue to Nacho Daddy: This is more disgusting than cute. Perhaps a health hazard and certainly and stomach-churning site for some. You're doing so many things right (include the large screen TVs) ... why be \"cute\" with the live scorpions? Just get rid of this weird and creepy addition."}
{"text":"AJ was absolutely amazing, charming, and incredibly helpful! He made our lunch at Nacho Daddy fantastic. Thank you AJ!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place our first night in Vegas and couldn't be more happy how the food turned out. My Husband and I are vegetarian and they have an intense amount of vegan options that were to die for."}
{"text":"The house margaritas and the service were definitely the highlight! The corn was tasty as well as the potato nachos but to be honest the \"gourmet\" nacho were less than desirable. The hamburger nachos ($13) were very basic meat and cheese plus some lettuce and tomatoes. The filet mignon nachos ($17) were massive but didn't suit my taste buds. Unfortunately we won't be back and won't be recommending Nacho Daddy to anyone :("}
{"text":"Location Tip: The entrance to this restaurant is outside on Harmon Ave. Don't waste your time running around inside of the Planet Hollywood shops like I did ;P  Navigation issues aside, my Vegan Fajita Salad was much tastier than I expected it to be. The vegan chick'n was marinated in flavorful spices. Nice touch with the grill marks too. The pico de gallo and guacamole were fairly mediocre. The fajita pepper & onions added heartiness to the romaine lettuce. But the real standout ingredient was the onion thyme vinaigrette. Omg YUM! http://bit.ly/2l68mbD  The BF had to work at an in-town trade show so I was dining alone. This place was extremely empty at 11am on a Monday. Saw about two other single diners and one small group in this large restaurant. But the friendly waitress did provide great service and checked in on me often."}
{"text":"First off, service was excellent.   Server and management were very attentive. Limited domestics on tap.  The disappointing issue was the nickel and diming.  It's a bit ridiculous to charge an exta dollar for fries with a burger and extra to get salsa with your guacamole and chips at a Mexican restaurant?   The food was good but overshadowed by the charging.  Don't know if we will return"}
{"text":"Visited tonight for a casual birthday dinner, can't complain. Came to this location once before, over a year ago, and was prepared to never come back; a birthday request for nachos changed that.   We came in and were promptly greeted by the friendly hostess, she got us seated pretty quickly and let us know Morgan would be our server. She took our drink orders, when she came back I checked in for the free Margarita which I ordered on the rocks. She brought out my Margarita, was a little heavy on the salt but over all tasty and definitely had more alcohol than expected in a discount drink.   When we ordered, Morgan let us know portions are pretty big and even gave some tips on how to reheat at home. We got the street corn app, supreme nachos, and lobster/crab nachos. Overall everything was tasty and the topping to chip ratio was pretty good, although I felt I paid more for the mango salsa on my nachos vs the crab and lobster sprinkle. The entire meal cost about $50, felt over priced for the mango salsa nachos and everything else. Upbeat atmosphere and friendly staff, still unsure that's enough to bring me back for the food and it's prices."}
{"text":"After being contacted by a manager and provided a sincere apology and gift card I decided to give this location another try. I picked up gift card around thanksgiving and didn't use it til 12/30. My nachos were perfection. Totally matched what I'm used to getting from them. I tried the florentine nachos and they were Devine. Great comeback nacho daddy!"}
{"text":"Prices are great. Food has great flavor.Food is fresh made scratch kitchen. Restaurant is very clean and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"I had a huge amount of leftovers. Our waiter was helpful, but didn't hover. The atmosphere was very laid back, so we stayed a long time talking. We both got nachos. The filet mignon was amazing!"}
{"text":"This is such a cool little spot. We sat at the bar and they had the garage style window open, which was really nice. I started with a white peach margarita and it was SO good! I had to restrain from chugging the whole thing right away. My husband got the blood orange margarita and it was good too (a little tart for my liking). I then tried another margarita that was one of their specials. I don't remember the exact name, but it was something sunrise related? It had fresh raspberries and agave. It was delicious! And these margaritas are enormous!   My husband and I shared the appetizer street tacos. We got the lobster and crab variety. They're served in doubled corn tortillas and with a delicious corn salsa. So yummy!   I ordered the supreme tostado nachos. Seasoned ground beef, shredded cheese, yellow queso, refried beans, pico de gallo, fried jalapeños, lettuce, avocado lime salsa, sour cream and guacamole.  Amazing! Honestly we probably could've shared these as well. It's a HUGE portion!   My husband got taco-enchilada combo with chicken on both. I personally would've ordered the mojo pork simply because I prefer pork, but I tried a piece of the chicken and it was very good! Super tender and juicy and very flavorful!   They lose a star because we waited a substantial amount of time for our food to come out. And our appetizer came at the same time as our entrees. We also received our food after the people next to us even though we ordered before them. Not the end of the world, but I'm talking 30 minutes we waited. Luckily we had our margaritas and fun atmosphere to keep us entertained   We will definitely be back in the future!"}
{"text":"We came after my mom got married!! Had some Awesome food + drinks of course and despite the long wait it took for it but our sever took care of some our drinks which was nice if her!! I definitely would come back!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best nachos but also has plenty more to offer. Great wait staff and fantastic establishment. If you don't go check it out you are missing out fo sho. I would give it more stars but 5 is the most."}
{"text":"Good for oily food lovers and sports watching but their chips are great! perfectly thin and crunchy.... nom nom"}
{"text":"Delicious nachos and margaritas, reasonable prices for the Vegas strip! I highly recommend! Not stingy on the liquor either!"}
{"text":"It's such a nice restaurant and I really like the atmosphere, it's very close or almost on the strip, so you don't have to drive too far to get some quality vegan food, they have a great vegan menu and even dessert (chocolate cake) which is one of the best I have ever had. The food has a great sason and flavor. The service is great and the margaritas are on point!  Great prices for the amount of food which is a lot, I couldn't finish my plate, but I was very satisfied"}
{"text":"Food was tasty and came out fast, but the service was really lacking. Our waitress didn't refill our drinks once. We asked the host to ask our waitress for refills. We waited about 25 mins for our check even though the restaurant was very empty on this Monday afternoon."}
{"text":"We eat here at least twice a month. The food is ways great and the service is amazing! This is by far the best Nacho Daddy location in Vegas."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is really cool with the sports bar motif. Our server was hilarious and very attentive with our drink refills and making sure we were okay. The food was VERY tasty and we shared their Supreme Tostada Nachos which was awesome. I was craving a burger so I ordered the Mexican Street Burger which was very juicy and was a good enough size so I could share it with my wife. We will be back soon!  **REMEMBER!** If it is your first visit and you check in on Yelp, you get a FREE House Margarita! And it was huge!"}
{"text":"This place has a large menu and great ambiance. I didn't really care for what I had, but I would go there again when I'm in Vegas. The menu is large. There is even a shot you can order with a scorpion in it! Not for me, but we did see a group try it. They play 80's and 90's videos, which was my favorite thing about the place. Our server was pretty cool. We also got a free house margarita for checking in on yelp. It was pretty good."}
{"text":"Great food! We were seated at the bar really quickly and served just as fast. A little disappointed that they ran out of the lobster and crab nachos, but the spicy shrimp was still good. The atmosphere is amazing as well. The hostesses was incredibly friendly and checked in with us several times, even when we were seated at the bar. Our bartender was helpful and nice at the beginning, but seemed to geta little frosty towards the end of our meal. Overall in highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"There are better... We arrived at 5:10 to an almost empty restaurant on St. Patty's Day & the kind of Irish folk music that gets aggravating to your ear after about 10 minutes (& the sameness of it didn't quit).  A server named Brie quickly arrived & I said we wanted the happy hour menu.  \"Only Mon. thru Fri.\" she said.\"  \"But when I called 20 mins. ago a woman said it was 7 days & that in addition to nachos on that menu, there were tacos.\"  She said that was not the case but they would honor both.  No cheap drinks on that happy hour menu, nor on the regular menu, espec. the margaritas.  Brie was peddling the corn on the cob at $6.50 & I ordered it, requesting it be cut off the cob.  Though the taste was quite good, it was swimming in so much butter that it spoiled the experience.  I also ordered chicken fajitas with corn tortillas ($15.50) & my partner chose his usual (at all Mex. restaurants), the chicken burrito ($10.50)  The orders came soon enough & he said his was good, though only accompanied by a big mound of tortilla chips.  My fajitas came with flour tortillas instead & though typical in taste, were swimming in oil & & the refried beans were too thick or too cold to spread.   I told Brie I asked for corn tortillas but they came near the end of my meal.  I also mentioned that the fajitas were way too salty & she said \"Oh no they're not.  I've had them lots of times.\"  We both liked the two salsas & I ordered the $1 Corona (7 oz.).  We figured we'd save the evening by watching the March Madness game at the bar, but guess what?  The bar is too high to reach unless you're a tall person & I hadn't brought a pillow.  And since, in addition to all of the above, the customer isn't always right at this establishment, why chance it again?"}
{"text":"Got the free margarita which was nice and some mini tacos. The guac here is stellar !"}
{"text":"A 2 star rating is generous to say the least. We ordered 3 entrees, all of which came with a bit of a wait. The fajitas were incredibly small and lack any flavor. The kids chicken tenders for my son were hard and cool. The French fries with the tenders were so bland and also cold. We asked for new fries but the ones they brought were also cold. The chips and guacamole were decent but nothing the write home about. All in all, we won't eat here again. The prices were expensive compared to quality. If you want Mexican food, take the time to drive 2 miles down the street and eat at merchandito or even Lindo michican with similar prices but bold and delicious flavor."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in for lunch and was pretty good. The quality of food is what I expected and the service was above average."}
{"text":"This place is a short walk from my hotel (Aria) and much more reasonable than the hotel restaurants. I came here for lunch with a vegetarian colleague. I had the pork tamale. It was terrific. Came with beans and rice. Just the right portion for lunch. Not too small/not too big. The pork was delicious. My colleague got the veggie burrito which he liked a lot as well.   And the meal was only $12. I paid more than that for coffee and a breakfast sandwich at Starbucks in the hotel.    I'm so bummed though. I didn't realize until I finished my meal that I had a free margarita with check in on Yelp :). Not that a margarita for lunch mixes well with work, but one can always dream."}
{"text":"I was super excited to come here because I love nachos but left kind of disappointed. It was good but not very filling. There was barely any cheese on my nachos, mostly ranch. Even though the plate is big, I still left hungry. They had a lot of choices for happy hour! I would definitely come back though and maybe try something different!"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try and oh boy! I'm so glad we did, wonderful staff and the food was outstanding. We actually liked it so much, we are here twice during our trip ."}
{"text":"Not a fan! Service was poor, drinks sucked & the nachos weren't much better.  After waiting over 5 minutes for someone to come to our table we moved to the bar hoping to receive service, but it still took awhile.  My friend ordered a skinny margarita and it tasted like Sprite - she didn't drink it. The Bartender didn't even ask if she wanted another drink after she questioned the ingredients (the menu didn't say they include soda, but the bartender said they do) and said it was disgusting. I expected some really awesome nachos considering the name of the establishment, but they were probably the least appetizing nachos I've ever had. Definitely won't return to the restaurant.   I've ordered fajitas from Nacho Daddy using UberEats and they have always been delicious and my order has always been complete and accurate. My experience at the restaurant was so poor that I probably won't even order To-Go again."}
{"text":"Got a free margarita with check in.  Got a huge plate of chicken nachos that were very good. Server was vert friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place because they have a very large vegan menu. But it was just not that good. I tried the vegan cheese they make here and it a metallic taste to it. So I ordered the avocado tacos and the only flavor really came from the avocado. They were just really bland.  The BF ordered the smothered burrito and he said it was okay, nothing great. He didn't even finish it which is not like him.  The house made maragritas are really good though. They offered a free one when you check in on Yelp. That was the best part of the meal.  The restaurant only had about 4 tables and our service was VERY slow. It took forever to get anything. I also think it is insane that you have to pay for chips and salsa at a mexican restaurant. I will not return to this place. There are many other places to go that are much better."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! I am a vegan and expect to see one or two items on a menu that I could eat. I don't expect any desserts.  This place had an entire page on its menu for their vegan food and included chocolate cake. My husband and I ordered the fully loaded nachos. We have not had nachos in years. They were amazing. The portions are enormous but we still ate every last bit of the nachos. I had a kale salad with vegan chicken. It was perfectly seasoned. They know how to cook here. And they make the vegan food with care and love!"}
{"text":"Yes! Finally! A spot I came to in Vegas that I LOVED! Let's get the bad out the way. Service isn't quite hitting here. The hostess who sat us put us in the corner so we were out of sight, out of mind. It took us nearly 15 minutes before the waitress even came out to take our drink order. After that, everything we got just took longer and longer for her to return. I thought this was going to be another 2-3 star Vegas joint until the food came.  I got the BBQ pork nachos. They were OFF THE CHAIN. PLENTY of nachos! Great tasting BBQ sauce. Pork was perfectly tender and covering all of the nachos as they claim. The cheese hit it all off wonderfully. I got a pomegranate margarita; it tasted great and was very potent, loved it.  My wife and I split a fried ice cream dessert. It was certainly ON POINT. The ice cream was really good, accompanied by the perfect crunch of the \"fried\" shell and the nachos and the drizzled syrup makes it very tasty. Awesome place overall; wish there was one in Chicago! If they can improve their service, it would be a 5-star hit every time!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great atmosphere and Jovanny is a fantastic server! A must-hit spot for anyone who loves Mexican food! Definitely coming back next trip."}
{"text":"Awesome place for vegan food after bar-hopping in down town. Service is fast and friendly and the drinks and vegan food are delicious and filling, especially the nachos, good for 2 people."}
{"text":"Love it!  Yummy Daddy's Margaritas, nachos and fajitas!  Our bartender Heather was super sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Not the best nachos ive had, not the worst. Basically equivalent to your run of the mill bar nachos.  The service however was really not good. I watched a server drop a cup. Then instead of picking it up, she kicked it under a bar stool. The bathrooms have grafitti scratched all over, plus, they got 4 things wrong in our order for 3 people. Granted, they were nice and fixed them, but still... they weren't even busy for a friday night...and it took forever just to pay the check.  With all the competition in mexican restaurants in Las Vegas, we are spoiled for choice. The problem is, this place doesn't stand out, so ill just go to one of the many great ones this city has to offer instead from now on."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! I love the fact that while you're waiting for a table they text you with updates. The food was awesome! I recommended the smothered burrito with cheese on top. My friend and I left very full and satisfied. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went to Nacho Daddy around 11:30 on a Tuesday. Restaurant was not busy at all. We waited about 5 minutes at the hostess stand before being greeted. Once we were seated we waited another 15 minutes before we were greeted by a server. During that time we watched the other tables struggling to get the attention of the server for a drink they had already ordered. We left before ordering and saw a line of 15+ people waiting to be greeted by a hostess."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Loved their vegan options! The frozen margaritas are really good and strong."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect but this place rocks. Nachos are excellent with lots of toppings without being too greasy. The house margaritas are spot on without too much sugar that makes you feel sick and even get one free if you check in on Yelp! Service was really friendly and I'll be back here for more nachos or maybe give an entree a try."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and I'm still impressed with how friendly the staff are! Very tasty Texmex food (best fajitas I've had on the strip), the chips and salsa are indeed bottomless, all day long breakfast menu, plenty of TVs to catch the game, and yes, a variety of nacho options. I look forward to my next visit to Nacho Daddy"}
{"text":"Got the filet mignon nachos.  Might be the best nachos ive ever had. No joke.  Flavor and everything was on point."}
{"text":"Cassandra was amazing, really sweet. The food was excellent. My friend had nachos, I had the enchiladas. He's a picky eater so this place worked out. I took the scorpion shot. It's a pricey shot but the excitement and the attention you get makes it worth it ! Checked in with yelp and got a free margarita and like 5 coupons to come back next time ! Which we definitely will."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. I literally took time out of my march madness betting and game watching to review this place. First of all, the name says it all it's NOT YO DADDY (and not yo daddy's nacho). I'm almost 100% positive that anyone that likes this place is 1 of 3 things. 1. Drunk and sunburnt on the brain. 2. A person who literally has never been to a movie theater (and had waaayyy better nachos for half the price). 3. Someone who doesn't even know hat nachos are supposed to be. Heck, try Cheesecake Factory appetizer nachos (those are actually really good and Cheaper), try Taco Bell nachos, or the nachos from del taco, you'll have a better result. Instead of putting your soggy Costco chips covered with dry flavorless chicken and NO toppings (e.g. Sour cream, salsa, etc.), why don't you just close your business and sell it to Starbucks so it can benefit us (and yes I know there is a Starbucks already right around the corner in the Elara lobby). Worst nachos ever. And why put nachos in a cardboard pizza box for \"to go\" purposes? They must not have tested that. Try walking to your room in PH, Elara, or Grand Chateau with these things and see how warm they are. Oh nice touch to have the cardboard stuck to the melted cheese... FYI if it's not in-n-out, I don't want cheese paper or any other type of container stuck to my food.  I will say this. After 10+ hours of reflection, I have some additions. Their management (Taylor) is very profesional and seems to genuinely care about the business doing a proper job. So credit (and the 1 forced star that Yelp demands) goes to her and her staff. If the food prep staff was as professional, perhaps my review would have been a bit different. Nevertheless the Decor in the establishment is nice and appropriate for what they must be paying for a rental space in a center strip view Vegas hotel. Although I wouldn't recommend it, it seems that most people seem happy with it, so gl NYD!"}
{"text":"Solid food... cool vibe... great service.  Like the creative approach on nachos... will be back."}
{"text":"So many vegan options! I was impressed! I had the vegan chimichanga and it was HUGE! It was also delicious. Wanted to try the vegan chocolate cake, but was way too full. Everything was perfect! I had a house Margarita, which was very yummy! My bartender, Scarlett was super friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The reviews on here were awesome and all Vegas food seems the same so we had to try. We ordered the buffalo chicken nachos and bbq pulled pork nachos. When the food came we had one bbq chicken and a bbq pulled pork. I tried to explain to the expo that I ordered buffalo chicken and he tried to tell me that's what I had in front of me. When the bartender came back to check on us I explained to her what happened. She said it was her fault and 10 minutes later my buffalo nachos came out. They were horrible. The chicken on top was fried chicken nuggets that were completely soggy. The entire plate was covered in Franks Red Hot (don't get me wrong franks is great but not alone on top of chips for $12.) Sad to say I was that person who sent it back. Our BBQ nachos were good but nothing I would come back for. The server was great and took off one of our drinks, which I can always appreciate good service. Maybe just drinks and a light snack is the way to go here."}
{"text":"Good nachos, we had the filet mignon nachos. But ours is never as stacked high as next guys! Anyway, fun atmosphere, friendly wait staff and a yummy margarita with Yelp Check In. Oh and I was randomly chosen by the chef to do a tour of the kitchen. That was really nice. Will be back next time we're in town to try something else."}
{"text":"The 4 cheese nachos were Amazing!! Server was super nice and margarita was strong. Will definitely come back when in Vegas."}
{"text":"After much anticipation for the new location to open. Yesterday was the 1st day open. Typically a lot of things go south with new openings, Nacho Daddy was an exception. Our server Johnny was excellent. attentive, friendly and fast. The food was very good and the selection of Tequila is extensive.  It was also Taco Tuesday which gets 2 for 1 Tequila. Woo Hoo.  My only negative comment is the staff is not well versed in Tequilas. ND should train/educate all employees about Tequila.  With that being said we look forward to returning soon to the New Nacho Daddy's in Summerlin for another fun evening"}
{"text":"When you are in Vegas, this is a MUST stop! Great happy hour menu and you gotta try the scorpion shot and a self-serve craft beer.  Our super awesome sever was a bomb! Just ask for King Richard! A fun place to go!"}
{"text":"Definitely a recommend this place it's a very comfortable party atmosphere great environment food is great , specially the seafood nachos waiters are very friendly and you must have there margaritas ... I will definitely come back and don't forget the tequila shot with the scorpion  my daughter had a burger and I was delicious I had the enchiladas."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!! Had the supreme nachos and it was delicious. Our server was Sophia, she was so nice!"}
{"text":"I am going to say 3.5 to 4 stars.  I know it was the holidays when we came but it was a really long wait for the host to come. I get the holidays and such but there were servers and bartenders looking at us and no one could even acknowledge or say hold on a second that sort of killed my vibe.  They have cute stuff like #getstung if you down get the scorpion shot.  I got the crab and lobster enchilada  and it was just okay when I had the meat without the anything else it sort of tasted meh like just defrosted. The rice was really good and so was the queso.     LOVEEEE ME SOME GOOD QUESO.  My boyfriend got the mojo pork tacos and it was really meaty and juicy but I really wish it had more seasoning it was missing something.  also they offer a margarita when you do yelp check in and that was pretty good."}
{"text":"No complaints at all. No dry chips is accurate. Supreme tostada nachos are a must try. Option to do a live scorpion tequila shot; did not partake. :/ Just posting to share photos. Actually dined 2/4; posting late!"}
{"text":".... the nachoessssssss ..... so bomb  We had every variety ... you can't go wrong with a huge stack of the nachoes   We had a chicken bowl too it was good but the nachoes were too good and over shadowed the chicken bowl lol"}
{"text":"Good spot right off the strip near Miracle Mile. There was a bit of a wait at 7:30pm so I walked over to the bar and was able grab a seat immediately. The menu was pretty extensive with a variety of nacho, taco, enchilada and fajitas choices.  After looking over the menu I decided to go with the filet mignon and shrimp fajitas. This place is known for its scorpion shot which features a real scorpion. I wasn't feeling that adventurous so I went with the Cadillac Margarita instead. The margarita was good and made with house made sweet and sour and premium liquor. The fajitas were served table side sizzling and what you would expect from a spot like Daddy Nacho. The filet was tender with a good portion of shrimp mixed with peppers, onions, jalapeños and cherry tomatoes. I was particularly pleased with the side of rice, refried beans, guacamole, lettuce and pickled onions that accompanied the fajitas. Overall a good spot that I'll be sure to visit again.   Tip: Check in on Yelp to receive a free house margarita."}
{"text":"I went to Nacho Daddy for breakfast and it was really good.  I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was not dry at all and was great when dipped in the salsa.  It came with a side of chips which was a little weird until you remember that this is really a specialty nacho place. The service was excellent and it was fairly priced."}
{"text":"Great cocktails and good food.  Great place for a group, something for everyone.  Service was outstanding!...  It's on the Vegas go to for casual FUN food and drink."}
{"text":"They loose the 2 stars from me because of the rude and stern lady at he entrance who would not even care to open the door as she was close by but kept wiping the doors all to herself. Daizy and the supervisor were totally a sweetheart. Very courteous and prompt in helping us with the order. Definitely a place to try if you have a crave for traditional nachos :-))"}
{"text":"Breakfast was great. So good that we went back for lunch the next day! Lots of Gluten Free options, too. I have celiac disease and am used to having to just order a plain salad, but probably at least 1/3 of the offerings were marked as GF."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food with a great atmosphere. I can't justify expensive Mexican food but this place definitely does it and it great. The beers and margaritas were on point and the food was prepared perfectly as a burrito and nacho should."}
{"text":"Good Variety of food. Gave a free margharita with check in. Which deserves a star. We ordered the fajitas and the seafood nachos. Unfortunately the food was not very hot or fresh. Will try agian becuase my friend said it was normally better. If it is better I will update review."}
{"text":"I came for a 2nd visit and had 3 teenage girls with me. I loved the Triple Dip the first time I was here and ordered it again as a starter. The girls loved it and liked the variety of the salsa, queso, and guacamole. We ordered the mojo pork enchiladas, chicken enchiladas, BBQ chicken nachos, and the fajita salad with filet instead of chicken. Everyone enjoyed the food and the girls loved the nachos. I am happy to say that the steak in the salad was perfect, not salty. I did not have a cocktail so I can't update there. This is a solid choice for good food."}
{"text":"Went there with the family today for lunch. Heard lots of great things about the place. The salsa was the only good thing we ate. The food was horrible.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"So far so good.  I mean, if you is not, then you isn't.  Life is chill. And if you aren't living then you dead.  Keep it one hunnid. Never stop never stopping."}
{"text":"We loved this place.  Everything was excellent no left overs.  Also the had a huge tv screen and played the best videos ever."}
{"text":"Daddy Ryan was a smokin hot waiter with nice biceps, he got my friend the burrito she's always wanted and he didn't put salt on margarita to my requests."}
{"text":"Ventured to Nacho Daddy since a coworker recommended the place. We were on a business trip and thought we tried something different. The nachos are bomb, don't get me wrong and the Yelp Check-In to get you a free margarita was cool...but the service wasn't as great.   Let's talk about the food first. We all got nachos, you have to get the nachos, why would you get anything else at..Nacho Daddy. The plates you can easily share with two people but no. We all got our own plates = bad idea. The plates were good and I do recommend sharing since it is big. Or just go in there hungry cause we did and we finished our plates...again bad idea LOL.  We checked in with Yelp to get our free margarita and that was great...till the bill came. I know couple places that do this and if you don't check your receipts or they hear that you're on a business trip, they add on random things on your bill. Please always check your bill before you pay cause our waitress did not take off the drinks even though she knows it was FREE. She handed the bill to us not checking if it is correct?! So when we waved her down, we told her all three of us didn't get that taken off the bill, her response didn't seem like it was the first time she seen it happen. It sounded like \"I hope they don't realize I didn't take it off their bill\". Long story short, make sure to always check your bill before you pay~"}
{"text":"Whoa. That's all I can say. 3 minute walk from the strip, our family went there for dinner. The nachos were amazing! My son got just nachos and cheese and even those were delicious! They pile those nachos high, all for a reasonable \"non-vegas\" price.  They have a huge screen where you can watch the game, cool atmosphere, and scorpions in a terrarium. I'll be back. Very cool place!"}
{"text":"Awesome late night comfort food. Tortilla chips and toppings on their nachos were terrific. Staff was friendly, atmosphere was really comfortable and modern with a rustic feel."}
{"text":"Updated review. I've been speaking to Tyler Smith who works in the HR department. I was reached out regarding my review on the experience I had at nachodaddy.  This company I must say really does care about the customers and their experience here.   My bad experience was heard, and was offered a gift card (which I accepted the offer)  I'm now talking to another HR person Peter who  wants to hear my experience at nachodaddy also. I'm very impressed how quickly they responded to my Yelp review and my email and my call. I'm really hoping the next time I come to nacho daddy I will have a better experience with the staff.  And my food experience remains the same. The nachos I had ( enchilada nachos) were very very yummy."}
{"text":"Great service and great food,  Tifanny always had a big smile and was very helpful and knowledgeable of the menu,  i had th nacho daddy  mexican burger and  really liked the flavor of the mango with the chipotle onions in the burger  And the beef was  juicy and nicely seasoned, i am definetly coming back to try their nachos."}
{"text":"Burrito and tacos were perfect! The whole restaurant and bar were super clean and employees were great and kind Best Mexican I've had in a long time, definitely will be returning"}
{"text":"I give nacho daddy 4 stars, only because the staff needs to understand that a smile and kind demeanor will get you much further ( as well as higher gratuities) over a grumpy , frown of a face . Perk up, have pride in your job, no matter what it is, because that's having pride in yourself as a being. Food is awesome, staff at multiple locations should be more aware of bringing their attitudes and problems into work however."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. I had the Golden Knights nachos, they were okay. The white queso tasted good but there could have been more filet on the nachos. I had the cucumber jalepeño margarita, that was really good."}
{"text":"Not a good idea to not have free chips snd salsa. The food and service were good otherwise."}
{"text":"Ordered the fiesta nachos and they were delish. Chicken was flavorful and portions were large."}
{"text":"Nachos and magaritas were delicious! Filet mignon nachos and watermelon sangria were my faves. But service was even better. Our server Jovanny was so attentive and amazing which made the experience even better."}
{"text":"Ordered fajitas for 2...large portion.  Skimpy on the lettuce, no cheese and out of guac and didn't say anything til we had the food.  Also snuck a charge for a 2nd tortilla for our food since it was insufficient.  Gave a birthday sundae for my daughter.  Food tasted great.  A little dark inside.  Was decorated nice for halloween."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and love finding a restaurant with veggie options. I only had a few drinks when I popped in yesterday, but I will def be back to try the vegetarian nachos sometime. Our server Ari was fun and knowledgeable about the menu. Nice to see someone who actually likes being at work!"}
{"text":"Use the free yelp margarita!! Sooo good! I loved the vibe in here. Huge projector with music videos and really spacious industrial decor. I was so impressed with all of the vegetarian options. I ordered way too much but I'm not in Vegas often so I had to try as much as I could. Highly recommend! The hostess and servers were really nice."}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and nice. I waitress Darla was a sweethart. Are drinks took a while to get to us, so they were comped.  We had cheese enchiladas and the chicken street tacos with some watermelon margaritas. The rice was a bit dry but they rest of the food was okay.  They have a decent vegam selection, more than other places on the strip. I would come again"}
{"text":"I love this place it is awesome. They even have a app and I downloaded the app and you can order food from the app."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for just one night and I needed a restaurant with vegan options.  This was right outside of Planet Hollywood where we were staying.  The ambiance was great and the restaurant and staff had a relaxed and welcoming vibe.  We ordered the vegan nachos and the enchilada nachos and they were terrific! The portions  were huge and my first thought was we are never going to finish all of this but we did! Every chip had a topping not a pile of plain chips like you get sometimes in other restaurants.  We also enjoyed the free house margarita for checking in on Yelp and a few $5 happy hour margaritas as well.  I wish our visit was longer so I could have went back.  There was a whole page of vegan options that looked amazing.  It will be my first stop next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'm nacho daddy..  love this place!! Honestly the best nachos and margaritas ever!! Good selection of nachos even have a vegan menu for thoes that do that!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a nice getaway evening. Staff is vey friendly and attentive. Not expensive and you can carry on a conversation. Inviting atmosphere. Nice location (Summerland) The food is great  I had the Nacho Average Burger full of seasoned meat and avocado lettuce, just a lot of good stuff.  my lovely had the Tortilla Soup"}
{"text":"WHAT?! What is this magical place? Why has no one told me sooner? This world where everyone's favorite food group (that's right, FOOD GROUP) is not only featured, but the focus of their menu. How awesome is that? Could it get more awesome? Yes it could (if they put one in Reno) being in Vegas is pretty amazing!   Located right outside The Miracle Mile at Planet Hollywood it is pretty convenient, especially if you're in the shopping or Nacho mood. Patio seating with an aircraft hangar style door, also a great centrally located industrial concrete bar, and warm sunlight (in case it happens to be a cold day, as it was for us).   Because we seemingly don't know how to settle for a stock off the menu selection we went with the Supreme Tostada Nacho, but asked for the pico on the side and also a side of the enchilada sauce, but without the lettuce (cause that did seem weird, right?). First, how awesome was the bartender? They brought out our order and he immediately noticed the presence of lettuce and threw up the stop sign. All apologies, it was returned to the kitchen and a fresh prepped replacement was brought shortly thereafter. Second, these were the best nachos ever!!!! Ermergosh! Such a great blend of flavors and I was halfway through the order, before I remembered we had the sides. Unfortunately, I had waited so long that the enchilada sauce had cooled before I got to it, because I'm sure warmer would have been better (still pretty good).   I digress, let me finish this thing. Aside from amazing nachos, the bar hosts plenty of tequila (as they should), some decent beer (some local), and a friendly, smiling, engaging, conversational, smart, fun staff. Who wouldn't want to be here, eat here, roll around in a pool of nachos here? I'll never return to Vegas, without visiting here!"}
{"text":"The vegan nachos here are so unbelievably amazing that I have converted die hard meat eaters to order them!  Everyone I bring here is always asking me when we can go back!  I am devastated they closed the eastern location in HENDERSON because that was where I frequently went with my family. Now I only limited to going during the work week and rarely make it"}
{"text":"Alexander took care of us tonight.   Excellent service and great conversation !  We will definitely be back.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Food was great, and reasonably priced.   We ended up here for breakfast because we wanted somewhere close to the strip that was not $20 a plate. Our party of four was very satisfied. We actually went back for breakfast the next day too.   We ordered the breakfast burrito, veggie omelette, breakfast taco, lobster nachos, huevos rancheros and wet burrito. It was all great.    Great food at a good price is hard to find on the strip, we will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! I ordered the cheese enchiladas and substituted the corn tortillas to flour. Ended you with the trio (cheese, salsa and guacamole) and chips -- so delicious. I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Eh...For them to specialize in nachos, they're just \"ok\". Nothing wowed me. I've had better nachos at Robertos...or Baja Fresh. They're not bad, just not GREAT."}
{"text":"Our server was so helpful and kind.  The food was delicious and I would highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Yes this restaurant deserves 5 stars as others have attested. Huuuge portions, good quality and IMHO the best salsa that goes on the (enchilada) nachos and fajitas that we had.   In addition the Pacifico beer went down so well with the food smothered with salsa, guac and sour cream.  Also had the huevos rancheros on an earlier visit and would return again for that breakfast."}
{"text":"Overall very mediocre environment and food quality. In addition our service was quite lackluster even though we attended for a friends 21st birthday dinner. Would most likely not go back again. However, if you check in on yelp you do in fact get a free margarita."}
{"text":"Very tasty nachos. I had the filet mignon nachos. Large portions and it was delicious! Looking forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"Omg the rice was phenomenal, enchiladas on point. The Margaritas #amazing and our bartender Kimberly #awesome!!!! Truly #amazing place"}
{"text":"I wasn't a huge fan of the tex-mex food here - it was merely okay. One exception, however, are Nacho Daddy's pigeons. They fly through the restaurant and are free for the taking if you can catch them yourself.  They're delicious raw, and most importantly, fresh! I will definitely return for more soon!"}
{"text":"You'd miss this place if you blink...it's on a side street off of Fremont Street...great place, friendly staff....food was excellent, well attentive staff...we went there for breakfast and would go back at night, unfortunately we were leaving that afternoon...will definitely go back there again!"}
{"text":"I really appreciated this place. So many Mexican restaurants in the area had very limited menus and we had to search around for a place we actually wanted to eat in. Nacho Daddy was it. There was no wait, plenty of seating, and tv's all around. Our waitress was amazing and very attentive. The food was also good. I had the baja combo and it was very good. Didn't wait long for a group of 4."}
{"text":"Amazing! I had the crab and lobster nachos and the buffalo chicken nachos! They both were SOOOO GOOOD. My friends and I went back to back the next day just try different things there. The nacho portions are pretty large, great for 2 people. My boyfriend and I eat the plate clean and were both stuffed. If you are going for the first time, make sure you check in on Yelp to get a free margarita! I LOVE NACHO DADDY. Wish there was one in California.. please come to California!"}
{"text":"First time at Nacho Daddy. Very nice place. I would like to say the food was excellent. However, I didn't get to eat because, after waiting 15 minutes for a server, I walked out. The restaurant was empty yet servers would walk past us without asking if we needed help. Doubt we'll return."}
{"text":"Looking for something tasty and a dish that can be shared amongst a group - go to Nacho Daddy! The restaurant is loud and fun but makes you want to move and dance while waiting for your food. They have a great variety of options and will surprise you with the different flavors in their creative nacho dishes!  When I visited Nacho Daddy with two others we ordered: The Moco Loco Nachos, Lobster & Crab Enchiladas and Chicken Tamale. The table favorite was the Moco Loco Nachos. It was so delicious that I stopped eating my own plate (enchiladas) to eat this plate more! Although I didn't get to try the Chicken Tamale, my friend was raving about it and cleaned her entire plate. The Lobster & Crab Enchiladas were a risk and unfortunately weren't my favorite. I only finished one with the help of my husband. It may just not have been a dish for me. The flavors didn't go together so well and were in no comparison to the Loco Nachos.   I rate this place 5 stars and will visit again because there were so many options, the service was good and the restaurant was clean and upbeat. Loved the music selection and vibe overall. Try it out - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"T-Rex our waitress was amazing.   Great suggestive selling and awesome attitude.  Try the cucumber margarita its deliciousness.   A++++"}
{"text":"1st time here, had the filet mignon nachos which were really good! The bartender Bryce offered great customer service and was very attentive. Will be back!"}
{"text":"My coworkers wanted to eat at Nacho Daddy for annual our work Christmas dinner & after hearing so much hype about the downtown location - I decided to give it a try.  (I figured Summerlin location would be just as fun as downtown). I tried to make reservations for our larger party in advance twice, each time my phone number was taken and they said a manager would call me, which did not ever happen. I finally called again a few days before our planned outing and just made a regular reservation, no manager approval needed. I realized it's probably a lot more casual than I was picturing.  After we got there the servers and hostess were super nice and accommodating however the food itself was not great (I'd rather eat nachos from Robertos or KoMex) and I am not sure if it is because of where we were sitting or the fact there were other large parties there, but half my party ordered extras (like sour cream or guacamole) and it didn't come until the end of the meal, after they had eaten most or all of their food.  The name Nacho Daddy is cute and the thought behind the food and menu was better than the food itself.  The prices were reasonable (my bill was half of what I had budgeted on spending on our party) but I do not plan on returning there again.  After hearing feedback from my staff in the office the next week their sentiments were the same."}
{"text":"Delicious! Free margarita you get with check in is yummy! Wide variety of vegan options is amazing! My husband and I came back twice during our 4 day trip to Vegas. I had the vegan chick'n nachos which are amazing but HUGE! Second time I had the vegan quesadilla with chick'n which was also delish! Husband loves the shrimp tacos!!"}
{"text":"Came for Taco Tuesday.  You are able to pick 3 for $5 (chicken, beef, pork) or 3 for $7 of their more specialty tacos (aside, shrimp, lobster).  They offer more some don't be afraid to ask.  The tacos were very fresh just lacked a little authenticity in the taste.  Our server was wonderful and very attentive!  It wasn't very busy so the food came out quickly which was appreciated.   They offer military discount and another taco tuesday special is the 2 for 1 shots of Tequila!!! Who wouldn't love that!?!?  The only reason why this place doesn't get 5 stars is because the taco's don't quite match the price  even discounted.  The Nachos that they are known for seems pretty impressive.  I would come again and try those next time."}
{"text":"Great place. Victoria, our waitress, was very sweet and attentive. Good place to catch a game and enjoy some nachos."}
{"text":"Lee was a great server! Amazing food and amazing service! My family and I go here all the time because they have an awesome vegan menu and a great regular menu for the non vegans. Something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, staff and atmosphere! 1st time in Vegas, would definitely go back! Great value and delicious nachos, every chip had yummy stuff on it!! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great.place. The food was absolutely delicious and very affordable. The atmosphere is really laid back with a BWW feel to it. This is a great place to go for authentic Mexican food. Good Stuff!"}
{"text":"Always great food ... downtown location is best, but very little sacrifice at Summerlin other than beer selection... killer nachos and retro videos ......."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Monday night around 10pm for some nomsZ. Place was pretty dead when we arrived but at least 12 people came in after us. Nachos artistically plated, perfect for my OCD dreams! Got a deal on a bucket of Coronas which was perfect to wash down NACHOS covered in my 2 favorite hot sauces - Cholula and Tapatio!'"}
{"text":"I moved in across the street. I just wanted a cool place to go and drink and eat some food. Bartenders are great. All the people there are nice and the food is good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Restaurants, i always recommend Nacho Daddy to Our Guest. My favorite is the Vegan Menu"}
{"text":"Food good and enjoy the free drink in your lap. But you'll still have to pay for the beers even though your pants, shirt, and table are incredibly sticky from the soda spilled all over you!"}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy outside of @phvegas  Killer #happyhour  2 #Pacificos , 2 Chipotle #Sliders , and 3 #Chicken street #Tacos all adding up to less than $20. Kind of unbelievable for the type of quality. Good portions. Plenty of chicken on the tacos and nice sized sliders. Both were #delicious as well. I'll be back to try the #nachos"}
{"text":"Located on one of the busiest areas on the strip, right by the miracle mile shops, this place is truly one you should try!   To start off, our server was fantastic! She was so patient, friendly, and obviously knew the menu very well. She was happy to answer our questions and honor the yelp check in for a free house margarita.   The menu is quite large! There's gotta be some item for everyone. We ordered the four cheese nachos, the mexi-Cali burger, a chicken tamale, and the breakfast tacos. Everything was served hot and looked presentable. My tacos were bomb!! Their rice was a little dry and bland so you may need to throw some hot sauce on it. Their nachos are really good! Next time I'd try the spicy shrimp ones. All their portions are hugeeee and not badly priced at all! We paid about $75 for 2 margaritas, one appetizer, and three entrees. For Vegas, that's a deal."}
{"text":"So we stopped by before going to a movie with friends.  Wow!  Best damn shrimp I've had in a long time.  The food and service was phenomenal as always."}
{"text":"We came here after flying into Vegas pretty late on a Friday night. It was fairly empty and took a few minutes to be seated, but once we were, our server immediately came over and was very friendly. The ambience was nice. They were playing a fun variety of music videos on the many TVs.   We ordered the Thai chicken bowl, which was very yummy, and the buffalo hot nachos. Our server accidentally put the Thai chicken nachos into the computer, so those were initially brought out. She quickly realized her mistake, and the kitchen remade the order and brought them to the table within about five minutes. The nachos seemed a little rushed and lacking in toppings, but they were okay."}
{"text":"Food was so bland, and expensive for bad food. You don't get complimentary chips.  The hostess was short with us. Dropped us off at table and didn't say a word. The waitress was very nice  I will never eat here again I might gets a drink. I did get a cucumber spicy margarita which was pretty good."}
{"text":"My husband and I are true foodies! We rely on other Yelp reviews to go outside the box of usual in Vegas. Nacho Daddy great reviews....well they almost lost our business when it took us 29 minutes to get a beer at the bar. No it wasn't busy!  Meanwhile they lost 3 potential customers during the same wait at the bar and lack of acknowledgment, on a Sunday afternoon. However, patience does preserver, we saw how slow the bartender was moving and ordered a bucket of beers, and put our order in once we got her attention. Well we got the beers, server forgot to place our food order, oops!! We were determined to experience what all reviews were saying. We did finally get the right order and wow INCREDIBLE!! Imagine how much more they could impress overall and grow demand if they could fix who hires and trains the staff. Food incredible but sad how much we saw them lose out on due to poor staff training. NACHO Daddy has great potential. We will return but be prepared for long delays in order to get the incredible filet mignon nachos."}
{"text":"Always have good time every time I visit this place.  I always request Davor as my server/bartender every time I visit. Service is always top notch. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Gonna keep this short and sweet. Everything was average. Not good enough for me to eat there again. I had the triple dip (I believe it's called) and Filet Mignon Nachos. The spicy salsa tastes much like plain tomato salsa with some jalapeño peppers on top to make it spicy. The queso dip wasn't bad but the guacamole tasted like smashed avocados with nothing else added. I thought the steak on the nachos would have a grilled flavor and there would be a little more of it. Your staff however was very pleasant and the service was good. I don't mean to be harsh but those are my honest thoughts."}
{"text":"Came into Vegas for a trip and stopped here at the recommendation of a friend. The queso is really good, I'd recommend that. The coffee was also pretty tasty. We ordered the filet mignon nachos and this needs more meat, WAY less tomato sauce. It could seriously go without it since it's really over powering. It's probably done to cover up how little filet is actually in the nachos, also not confident it's filet. Tasty but meh   It was okay. I don't think I'd come back for those nachos.  Good service though"}
{"text":"I live in Sacramento, CA and wish we had this place at home. Every time I come to Vegas, I eat here!!! Not only is the food unique and excellent but the service is ALWAYS beyond friendly. Why can't all restaurants hire friendly staff like Nacho Daddy.  Alex at the west Sahara location is an amazing person!"}
{"text":"I have no words for the service or should I say lack of service at this location. When you walk pass empty tables and you sit and sit and sit waiting for someone to acknowledge you. You see other servers and you can figure out your non existent server only has a 2 top and a 1 top. The one top is paying and the 2 top already has entrees. You continue to wait and wait.  You try to catch someone's eye and nothing. You go to the hostess and she just stands there. You  call someone over and he says I'm not on the clock. You get frustrated  and walk out hostess says oh sorry and you tell her you just stood there after we came to you. Our drive to your location is 30 minutes since you closed your Eastern location and you just completely ruined our night. You may think I'm overacting but come on if you just walked by and say I'll be right there any acknowledgement would be great. You weren't that busy with the empty tables. This isn't the first time for the crappy service and you have to much competition down the street at Downtown Summerlin to give such service on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Won't be going back. We went for my step-son's 18th birthday. The hostess was very pleasant and welcoming, the server however was not. She wasn't sure of the menu. She asked if we wanted chips and salsa and then took forever bringing it to the table. There was another party  in our area...only other one in the section....that was apparently more important, she made three trips to their table before we got chips. The gentleman who brought our food to attentive, my hubby asked for no sour cream he took his food away, and brought it back. Didn't see our server much. She came and collected the check  not asking if we needed change.....she just never came back. No thanks."}
{"text":"I went to this place few months ago and I was not impressed. The food is only OK, eatable, but that's it, nothing special ... I wish it was better because I like the design of the restaurant. Service was also just OK. I wouldn't recommend people about this place and I don't think I'll go there again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere : when I first came in I wasn't even sure if kids were welcomed here.  Server : nice , attentive highlight of the night I left my card in the slot holder and was in my car writing my review and he brought it out to me. Great to see honest kids working !   Food: Eloté or Mexican street corn - it was over with something so much that there were no layers to the corn like you expect when you get street corn. Typically you have the hot sweet corn , the richness from the butter and mayo followed by a sharp bite of Cojita Cheese a little tongue tickle with the Chile and the to cut through it all a splash of lime.  With this corn I found it to be overly flavored with garlic I believe the layers just all bl NCED and melded together. Not what I expected for $6.50 for one whole corn.  Fresca and Frijoles the corn is half the price and much better.    Two kids ordered burgers I asked for them to be cooked Medium and they both had these frozen overly cooked dried out hamburger patties.  They were very thick though.  The frozen fries were of horrid cheap quality.   I had fish tacos one grilled one fried. The fish was half the size of the taco shell and the way they assemble the taco is disastrous and weird.  The tortilla is thick like a flauta kind of its good but the way they bed the taco with the cabbages and salsas is just weird. If you take the fish out it's about 60-70% the length of the tortilla.  It feels like a rip off and it is.   Dessert: Deep Fried icecream now if you have had this ice cream you know that this is a great treat because of the hot exterior shell and cold cook center is a double treat in one well Not Here.  It's like they fried the ice cr an ball then put it back into the freezer to serve whenever people ask for them. The exterior shell is so weird and hard to chew.   It's basically like this they are Highly Over Priced for the quality of food they serve.   This is Las Vegas get with it."}
{"text":"Bachelorette party got started with free margs. Jovany was a great and accommodating server!"}
{"text":"Some of the best nachos I've had in a long time! No chip left dry is printed on the menu and that's what you get!"}
{"text":"I come to this place all the time during my Vegas trips and it never disappoints. The atmosphere is fun, open, and great for large groups.   The selection of nachos are ridiculous and they have crazy combinations of meats, cheeses, sauces etc. They also have a great bottlemless chips and salsa appetizer for the party people. In our group we ordered the taco salad, shrimp and steak fajitas, and nachos. I was pleased with the food, it was kind of oily but maybe if I had gone into the restaurant a little more intoxicated I would have been okay with it. All in all it's still a great time and I'll be back my next Vegas trip I'm sure."}
{"text":"Great place to watch Sunday night football. The staff were super friendly and helpful in selecting margaritas and food. Shrimp nachos were unique and delicious. They even brought fried ice cream with candles and sang happy birthday for my husbands birthday! We picked the right spot to celebrate!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and good service. A little hard to find, however. Could use more signage."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with this place. We decided to go on a date night which we haven't done in a long time and thought to try this place. We walked in and it wasn't  that busy at all and we had to wait 15 mins to be seated. We ordered our food but we were waiting and waiting for the appetizer (chips and salsa) to come and then our entrees came. Two mins after we were served our entree and appetizer finally came out. The waiter did take that off our bill for the inconvenience which we were grateful. For the price of the food I was very disappointed. I would not go back."}
{"text":"Price is a little hi but all around fun nice bomb ass food nachos not limp nice an crunchy worth every dime"}
{"text":"Fresh tasty TexMex.  More than just Nachos.  We had the chicken fajita bowls and they were awesome.   The house margarita was great and the first one is free with the yelp chrckin.   Happy hour runs until 7 pm during the week.    Lots of tvs to watch your favorite gamr"}
{"text":"The nachos we got were the supreme tostada nachos. They didn't blow me away and the jalapeños were too spicy and overpowered the flavor. For a place with nacho in the name I expected better. Also the service was slow and we didn't get offered refills on our water. Don't get me wrong the nachos were good, I just expected better!"}
{"text":"This was my favourite restaurant during my recent trip to Las Vegas. I highly recommend the vegan Chik'n fajitas if you are vegan or vegetarian or not. They are frik'n amazing! Also Rebekah at the bar was an awesome server. She really took great care of us. Next time I am in Las Vegas I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came in for trivia night and it was a blast! Zach made a specialty margarita that made my entire life! The food was excellent and a great value!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!!!! My husband and I stopped here on our recent trip to Vegas. It is on a side street off the strip so you do have to pay attention for it (right next to Buffalo Wild Wings). Our waitress was very sweet and down to earth, and we had fun just chatting with her. To start, we had the buffalo wings which were awesome. We shared he loaded nachos, which our server recommended as a shareable entree although if you were pretty hungry I'd recommend getting your own portion and not sharing. We had the fried ice cream to finish which was sooooo good I was actually dreaming about it when we got home. Definitely a fun, delicious restaurant and one of the few places in Vegas where I didn't feel ripped off... yippee!"}
{"text":"I stopped here on my last trip to Vegas. I was really interested in trying the vegan queso.   Food: I ordered the avocado tacos and the vegan queso. The tacos were really good. I wasn't sure that I would like fried avocado, but it worked. The salsa was perfect because the batter wasn't really seasoned, so it wouldn't have tasted good without it. The queso was also good. The toppings have to be stirred in otherwise it could be bland. I ordered a root beer, but it looked like they had a really good selection of alcohol if interested. I sent my husband back the next day to get more queso for me.   Service: because I went by myself, I just sat at the bar. Rebecka was very nice and checked on me fairly often."}
{"text":"Food was fucking solid , but the service sucked so bad that I should have just walked the entire length of the strip and stumbled into oncoming traffic.  That would have been less painful."}
{"text":"Cassandra was great! Very instagramable dishes! Short walk from strip. Lots of tvs. Scorpion shot comes with an actual scorpion on top"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. We especially enjoyed the special bar margaritas, the White Peach, Blood Orange and the Spicy Cucumber w/ jalapeño were great! The service was even better! Kudos to our amazing server, Chase! Loved all his recommendations. We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"We loved the atmosphere, the service, but most especially the nachos! So delicious and we couldn't stop ourselves. It might be named Nacho Daddy, but our tummies looked more like Nacho Baby when we were done. My husband did the scorpion challenge too!"}
{"text":"We went here on a whim after walking around the strip and shopping. We brought our 3 kids and were promptly seated with a smile.  The server was absolutely amazing! Rachel was very helpful in deciding what to order from drinks to apps to meals. We settled on the queso and salsa for a start and the presentation was very unique and fun! They put a tea candle underneath the dip to keep it warm. This allowed them to have a higher cheese ratio because it never cooled down, making for a tremendous queso dip! Probably on the the best I have ever had. (And I make a great one at home)  For our main meal we had tacos, bowls, and burritos. The kids meals were plentiful and varied. The kids tacos were huge and my 9yr old could barely finish it. The adult pork tacos almost busted at the seems with the delicious shredded Carnitas. The unique chicken Thai tacos were sweet savory and spicy, and will be reordered when we go back again this trip. My wife had the Thai chicken bowl and it was similar to the tacos but varied enough to mention. With the corn in the bowl it added a sweetness that really complimented the dish. The beef burrito was so big my 12yr old son took half back to the hotel with him.  For drinks the house margaritas are wonderful. They aren't too sweet and you can still taste some of the tequila. Bonus points for being served in mason jars!  I have to reiterate that our server was the best part. She helped us order to be sure we didn't repeat thing were were getting like chips and salsa and queso. She was engaging, enthusiastic and charming. You could see how she cared about her customers happiness.  We asked when she was working because we will go back this trip to have the same experience!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great drinks and the nachos. Holy cow. We asked Arienna recommendations and she nailed every one. Right off the strip so super convenient to get to.  Definitely coming back while we're still in town."}
{"text":"Did not disappoint .  Food was so good and quick. The salsa was too spicy, they should have had levels.  Without the salsa, the other seasoning was perfect. Try it, you will be happy you did. Check in on Yelp and get a free margarita."}
{"text":"We got filet mignon nachos and substituted with lobster/crab. They were truly the best nachos I've ever had. So tasty! The filet mignon tacos... meat seemed over cooked. I'm a medium steak kind of girl where meat is cooked, and typically tender. The rice is pretty great. And hubby loooved the house margaritas. Great balance between sweet and sour. Staff were energetic and helpful. I plan to return."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty vegan food. I sat at the bar and had great service. I got the vegan chicken quesadilla and chips and salsa. If I'm back through Vegas I'll come again!"}
{"text":"Gotta love Vegas... Hello Nachos! Cool roadhouse vibe, loud music, bar, lots of sports on tv's. Pretty big menu, lot's of choices and some Vegan choices...How cool is that?!!  We started with a pitcher of white peach margaritas...Yum They were stiff strong and delicious!  We all ordered different dishes and got to taste each other's food...   All the food was on point. We ordered a Lobster crab nacho ...WOW! A spicy shrimp nacho, yummy! A vegan spicy burrito, it was good, woulda been better w salsa, but our waitress disappeared... we wanted to order an appetizer of jackfruit tacos, they were sold out... They must be good if they are sold out before 5pm on a Monday... Return visit is planned to try them. Instead we got fried avocado tacos,  Omg they were amazing! The one meat eater in the group ordered Filet mignon nachos and loved them! All the flavor profiles were delicious even the vegan ones. Would have given 5 stars cuz I really liked it, but our waitress who started off great. Disappeared, we tried to get change at the bar and he said NO! I still don't want that to negatively affect a really fun good meal. Plus our food coma's didn't last that long lol! I would recommend them and tell you that you can park at the miracle mile mall or get dropped off there and walk thru the REALLY cool miracle mile either before or after \"NACHO DADDY\""}
{"text":"I had the crab and lobster loaded nachos. The portion size is...large. That's probably a bit of an understatement. I was fairly hungry when I came in. I was not when I left. The taste is solid. Enjoyable meal, I'd return again."}
{"text":"The place was decent and prices were decent.  Nothing authentic with the menu.  Definitely a Tex-Mex restaurant. I got the enchiladas and they remained on the plate. Got a margarita and it took a long time to receive.  I believe it was the original and it tasted horrible.  How do you mess up a margarita? Anyway I would not return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Fun little place located outside the Miracle Mile Shops.  My boyfriend really wanted to go here (had decided this would be our first eating destination well before our arrival in town), and RAVED about the shrimp nachos; I found the enchiladas just okay.  The Cadillac Margarita was not strong at all, which surprised a lightweight like me.  The staff is friendly, and they have all kinds of videos playing on the tv, so it's a relaxing, inexpensive place to pass the time.  We did not try the scorpion shots, but it was fun to look at the the scorpions in the tank by the front door."}
{"text":"Fun place and not far off the strip at all! Sierra is the best bartender, fun and personable. DJ watched the bar for a bit, pours the best water!! He knows!! He was so fun to talk with, that's what a bar should be. Food was good, you will be happily stuffed. Go try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The Filet Mignon nachos were really good, margaritas a bit on the sweet side but still good, and great friendly service."}
{"text":"Food was more than amazing and our bartender Zach recommended the best drinks! Best of all, they have usb chargers under the bar... So excited this place is right around the corner from my house!!"}
{"text":"My first time in this place and the vibe was chill! We in Vegas so I'm thinking phukit let's see what's the binih! Good shyt made a Brotha feel comfy after a nice sized King Kong thumb of that Cali kill my munchies were subsided by some radical ass nachos and A quesadilla to make you want to slap ya chick for not putting it down in the kitchen like this here we love em though. A good looking on that discount for the drink cause it was fire and I did enjoy my time keep up you got my vote."}
{"text":"great food, prices and drink deals ....luv me the fajitas and margaritas!"}
{"text":"Literally the BEST Mexican food ever!!! Thank you SO much for having vegan options on the menu! Came here on my birthday and was absolutely thrilled, and our server was great! Will 100% be back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love this place and the music selection. Definitely a must when you want a satisfying meal to cure the drunchies... pa la cruda!!"}
{"text":"Food is great we have been here many times however this time was terrible service from the minute we walked in we were told it was a 10 min wait because they had one server... we waited 20 - 25 minutes and i had to ask if we could just be sat down and at least be given a menu to look at... we then sat down and waited patiently to order... after waiting for our food we began to feel drops of water leaking on us from the ceiling we told our waiter and  he said \"i think they are doing work on the roof, let me check\" instead of immediately re seating us. Then to wait over 30 minutes after finishing our meals to finally flag another waiter down to get our check... in all honesty out of all the times we have been here i have never received such bad customer service but that doesn't change that the food is still great!"}
{"text":"Update: I got to try the nachos again, was given a gift card for the inconvenience. They were really good this time and my order came super fast."}
{"text":"Server was Hazelanne, absolutely the best. Started with Daddy's Margarita and Kiwi Margarita with a Scorpion Shot. The scorpion got caught on a molar. I needed to chew it a little and rinse down with some water. Oh so good. Margarita's were very good. Portions here seemed large so we ordered and appetizer of street taco's and split an order of Supreme Nacho's. Fillet Mignon street taco's were tender and had all the flavor of a traditional beef street taco. Nacho's were a very large portion. Not to much of any one ingredient, well balanced. I will definitely return to this restaurant, after all a guy has to eat more than one scorpion in his life."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went here for dinner and got the vegan chicken burrito and nachos, nachos were awesome but the chicken burrito had real chicken I'm sure of it, my husband got so grossed out after taking two bites and spitting out the chicken, we've eaten at different locations multiple times and never had a problem, right away he could tell it was real chicken, we brought it to the waitress attention and she tried telling us that it was vegan chicken but we know that it wasnt, it tasted like chicken and even had the texture of chicken, the vegan chicken although it replicates it well we can always tell it's fake meat, and this was not, we were not offered another which wouldn't matter because my husband was so grossed out, but also we weren't offered to get that taken off the bill even after seeing that the burrito was still almost all on the plate, (we dissected the burrito to see if the rest looked like real chicken) what a waste of money, so disappointed! Maybe it's just this location because since then we've gone to the other locations where the vegan chicken burrito was actually vegan chicken  lesson learned will never go here for vegan menu! And if you decide to go just double check the chicken!"}
{"text":"Prime spot for a good bite on the strip. Came cause I got the recommendation from a local and brought my friends along with me. They all ordered the Fiesta Nachos while I ordered the Nacho Average Burger Nachos. We were also able to use the Yelp Promo for a free Margarita, so it was a bomb combo. The nachos didn't disappoint. Good to taste and at a good value for your money. The plates were huge and it seemed like I wouldn't be able to finish them, but I did anyways.  Key tip: If you buy a Fat Tuesday from inside Planet Hollywood and then come here, they'll take your Fat Tuesday and keep it in their \"Freezer.\" it'll turn mushy later when your done with the food. Either buy it well before you head here, buy it after, or down it quickly at the door."}
{"text":"Came to get out Nacho Fix. Great food, great service and a special Thanks to Jessie for outstanding customer service!!"}
{"text":"Just opened on the Harmon side of Planet Hollywood. We had our fantasy football draft here on a Friday night 7pm. The place was fairly busy, but the hostess knew of our party and promptly, without even asking, guided us to the stairs that led to our party. Point for knowing the situation.  Service was ok, just a bit slow at times but understandable since our party had about 18 people all putting in various orders at various times, and only one server, MJ. She did a great job handling all of us. Billing was perfect, no issues there.  I had the beer battered lobster tacos, that came with a side of rice and side of beans....standard fare. The tacos were tasty, loaded with salsa that almost overwhelmed the entire dish. I wish the lobster would have been a bit larger so it balanced out all the lettuce and salsa better.   I'll give them 3.5 stars. I'm not a huge fan of Nacho Daddy, based on a few meals at the old Henderson location."}
{"text":"I am shocked at the good reviews. It is why we picked this place. You can get better Nacho's almost anywhere else. We went mid day and the server recommened breakfast and it was downright horrible."}
{"text":"Pulled chicken and beef really?? Come on I just came from San Diego and Rubios is 100x better even Taco Bell uses real chicken and not pulled chicken. Baja Fresh is really good fast food Mexican. So we asked the waiter if they had tacos with real chicken not the pulled crap she ensures us they do and I order a taco and to find out its pulled chicken I tell her this is not what I ordered and she argues with me I never mentioned anything about non pulled chicken it's funny we had 10 food items come to our table we didn't order because the waitress put in the wrong table she brought us the wrong nachos and pretended they were the correct ones but the cook told her she was wrong and she seemed confused but tried to pawn off her mistakes on someone else. Hope this place goes out of business"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and it did not disappoint. As a new vegan of 6 months I was blown away by the selections on the vegan menu. My fiancée and I had the vegan quesadillas, fajitas and queso dip. They were all amazing and were super large portions. My only complaint is I didn't have the room to try more items so I will be coming back soon. The location is a little tricky. It is outside the miracle mile mall on the sidewalk not inside the mall at plant Hollywood.   If you are vegan in Vegas try this place out."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was good, drinks were great. Didnt order one myself but got to watch someone take the scorpion shot - not for me!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas, Nacho Daddy is one of the first stops I make. And I always end up going multiple times! It's conveniently located on the corner of Harmon and S Las Vegas Blvd. Plenty of tables, bar seating, and easy to find.  If you're going on a weekend, they're open 24 hours and it's a perfect place to get late night munchies! During the regular week, they're open until 2am, which is still pretty nice.  Their drinks are hard core legit. There are plenty of pamphlets and coupons around the strip and at your concierge desk for BOGO or a free margarita and they're pretty famous for them. I like the fruitier ones like blueberry, strawberry, and mango. But their classic is a classic for a reason. And they are HUGE. They are also known for their scorpion shots, which has a pickled scorpion in a shot of tequil. never tried one, but I'm sure it's a real conversation starter. They also have a full bar, so no matter what you're in the mood for, they can probably do it. But you have to have a margarita at lwast once here.  Secondly, their NACHOS. They do not disappoint their namesake. Literally not a dry chip! all the cheese mixtures they use are so perfect and melt evenly on the chips. They have a number of meats and other toppings too, but I've yet to have a flavor combo that goes wrong. Last time we were here, we got the filet mignon golden knight nachos and it was heavenly.  We've also been here before for breakfast! I got the churro pancake. it was MASSIVE, came with syrup and caramel sauce, and had a hidden lining of churros and cinnamon toadt crunch. Honestly, it was a gluttonous feast. I didn't finish it though. My husband got the huevos rancheros and it was perfect. Corn tortilla slathered in eggs, cheese, salsa. The guac on the side was great too.  Some other great things about this place-- staff is always super friendly, there are a ton of TVs that are always playing music videos (sometimes hip hop, sometimes throwbacks, always fun), and they have a scorpion tank in the front of house. Best part is you get a quality experience for a quality price.  I. Love. Nacho. Daddy."}
{"text":"Desi was my bartender/waiter. Very fun and excellent server! Loved her! My crew and I had an awesome time  Food was awesome as well as those drinks"}
{"text":"Have visited this location quiet often when seeking out a good Mexican style food. They always seem to have a busy crowds there and its a fun atmosphere. They have good tasting, smelling fajitas they are sizzling when they come out of the kitchen, also their have amazing chips and salsa also. I would like to recommend getting the Fajitas or the Chimichangas. They are big and filling to one self, they also dont skimp you on any of the sides, like rice, beans, sauces. I would like to try the other locations throughout Las Vegas Area. I hope they are like this one, the staff is very helpful and friendly and good at recommending food to get what you are in the mood for."}
{"text":"I am so glad we ate here.  Nacho Daddy gave me exactly what I wanted: a unique twist on an old favorite that only Vegas can do.  Great ambiance.  The chicken enchilada nachos were amazing."}
{"text":"Another visit another great meal. Prime rib nachos and prime rib soft tacos. Great taste and full bar service available and pitchers of margaritas."}
{"text":"We walked in waited for 16 minutes for someone to take our drink order. Received drinks without straws and had to ask a 2nd time to get a sample of a beer. After 40 minutes when the beer sample never showed up and the waitress still hadn't taken our order we got up and left. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Happy casual place was just right, so we went for breakfast, then lunch the next day. A two-egg enchilada dish was very tasty. The Nachos with chicken and green chili sauce was big enough to share.  The Bloody Mary's were very good. I ordered mild spice. Both times the drinks were just so good!  Many dishes are spicy hot, so don't eat the jalapeños, or ask to omit them if you don't want the heat. We sat on the patio both times. The interior is nice decor with TVs. Was not noisy during the day."}
{"text":"The restaurant was a disaster when we went in. Almost every table needed to be cleaned off. The hostess said she'd get us a table in a few minutes, which she did. Once we were seated I was enticed by all the delicious smells. I decided on the Tostada Nachos which came out quickly. They looked amazing and tastes even better. The server was attentive to us and beverages were refilled quickly. I wish there was a location in my home town."}
{"text":"Came here from Chicago to visit family. Great happy hour and awesome margaritas! Definitely gotta do a scorpian shot to tell all your friends. Our server Richard was fast, friendly, and attentive. Definitely a must visit!"}
{"text":"So good! I was excited to checkout Nacho Daddy because I saw that they had a lot of vegan options. My boyfriend and I ended up going there our last day in Vegas for lunch and we were so impressed.   He got a plate of nachos with chicken and I got a fajita plate with vegan chicken and vegetables. Both of our plates came with a lot of food, and if you're interested in getting the same thing you could definitely share with someone else.   It all tastes really fresh and flavorful. My boyfriend also got a margarita and enjoyed that as well. Check it out, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Waitress was friendly. The food runners though forgot one of our friend's food. Thankfully, the waitress checked on us and brought his food out. The nachos are packed and tasted well above standards."}
{"text":"Nacho Daddy won me over as my favorite restaurant in Vegas.  We had a blast with the Scorpion Shots.  I came back to Phoenix bragging that I ate a Centruroides scorpion and didn't get stung... my toxicology friends corrected me and pointed out the type I swallowed actually is not a Bark Scorpion and am not quite as cool as that (apparently the shape of the tail was the clue).  Our group took the shots together, and one of my friends made the mistake of chewing the little bugger... don't do that.  Margaritas were excellent, nachos were killer (one of the best bangs for your buck in Vegas - try the shrimp or the filet mignon nachos!), but honestly the service was even better.  Audre was our hostess and was absolutely amazing.  We actually came back a second night during our week-long stay to take more scorpion shots, mainly because of the friendly atmosphere.  It feels like a nice local bar in a small town, and it's able to avoid the flashiness that covers the rest of Vegas.  Keep it up Nacho Daddy!"}
{"text":"Seriously bombest nachos ever! Decided to check this place out at like 1 am on my birthday while in Vegas! Free house marg with check in and filet mignon nachos! Heaven!"}
{"text":"This is tex-mex not really mexican food, very very americanized, tasted like everything came out of a can, i cant believe they have such high rating"}
{"text":"Great margaritas!!!! The food was very good. The nachos were amazing. Would recommend highly"}
{"text":"I am reviewing this after our second visit; I'm not giving this place even one star.  Funny to place a review you have to award one star so this is truly against my decision. Service is awful; when the waiter messes up they go on an on with an apology.  Everyone makes a mistake correct it and get on with it.  Food comes out very slowly; both times I was there the restaurant was empty.  There's no excuse for bad service.  I ordered the cheese nachos last time and this time; not a huge culinary feat and yet not consistent.  I did get my free margarita for checking into yelp and that was good.  I'm not going back and told the hostess such when she asked me how everything was on our way out.  A young girl who was more concerned about her car accident today than possibly allowing us to speak to a manager.  Enough said."}
{"text":"I just tried this place for the first time and loved it! I have heard a lot about this place but never really knew where it was or what it was about. They have a vast variety of food and it's good! Good service and I will bring my husband here soon!"}
{"text":"We have been twice but this is my first time reviewing.   The first time we went, everything was great. Food was hot, portion was good, nachos were cheesy, and service was quick. We went on a weekday during lunch hours (I don't recall what day it was). We left FULL and happy.  The second time was the polar opposite. We were seated quickly which is the only plus unfortunately. It took about 10 minutes for the server to even acknowledge we were here. By the time she came, we all knew what we wanted. It took maybe 25 minutes to get our food after ordering despite the fact that it wasn't busy (Monday evening). Two of us ordered nachos and we had to request more cheese! Getting the check took a while too. Maybe it was a bad night.   So three stars for inconsistency!"}
{"text":"Susy is legit! She was super friendly and accommodating! She really took care of our group!"}
{"text":"First time here visiting Vegas, the staff was very friendly, our waiter Jovanny was awesome! He went above and beyond for us, with suggestions and our requests. We ordered the Thai Nachos and the Vegan Loaded Nachos, both were great. The white queso and spinach chips used on the Thai Nachos were so good. I will definitely make this place a must visit next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Meh, good but not great. Like the majority of Las Vegas, this place was kind of dirty. Since it was happy hour I sat at the bar. Pomegranate margarita was good. Ordered the cheese nachos which were meh as well. Pretty hard to screw up chips and melted cheese. Service sucked. There was one bartender when I sat down who didn't know what she was doing. Finally another bartender showed up to take care of all the people she had been ignoring and was apologetic about the wait. They did happen to have some live music when I went which was cool."}
{"text":"Arrived before 7pm to a half empty restaurant but then we were told there would be a 10 minute wait. That should have been our sign to leave right then. At 7:04pm we get seated, it then takes our server several minutes to get to our table as he was talking then cleaning another table. We place our order, my husband asks for a beer but heaven forbid you get only one beer! They want to make him go to this beer wall and pay a larger amount than one beer hoping to get him to drink several. So he ordered water instead. Kind of stupid you can't just get one dang beer. Our appetizer was chips and salsa which had not arrived by 7:26pm. This was after watching three other tables get their orders of chips and salsa before us. Two of those tables were seated after us! So we got up and went to the hostess station and asked that our order be canceled. I gave them back the free $25 voucher they sent my husband for the last time we had shitty service. Told them they could keep it since the idea was for us to come back and have a better experience. Oh and to top it all off while we were canceling our meal and I was asking to pay for the kids drinks the manager on duty was too chicken to come out and see what was going on. Just sent the hostess back out to tell me not to worry about paying for the drinks."}
{"text":"I moved from Vegas 3 years ago, but was a frequent guest at their Henderson location. I knew that I wanted to enjoy ND while in town, so i found this new location. I brought my entire family along. We enjoyed an amazing dinner ranging from Vegan fajitas to various nachos, all were amazing! I was also praised by the vegetarian family member for bringing him somewhere with such an expansive menu for vegans/vegetarians. The waiter was also outstanding, and quite patient with our somewhat needy and indecisive group. I am so glad we made it by while in town. The updated size of nachos is spot-on, and all items are perfectly priced.  Love the new location and building as well."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Second time being here and everything is great. If you guys already don't know  by now I really love Mexican food and will be at Mexican spot most nights. I stumbled soon this place driving down the road. It really has changed since the last place was here. Nice atmosphere. Plenty of tvs everywhere. Food is amazing and great job at hiring such a great staff. They all have been working and keeping up with the crowd here tonight :) I enjoy this play so much, have to bring the family next time"}
{"text":"Both times we have been to this location we loved our waiter. But it is very obvious they are always under staffed it took us 30min just to get our sodas. No joke we were warned by guests who left instead of waiting for their order. Also because they took so long to bring our food we finished our drinks and by the time we actually got our refills we were done eating which sucked. I honestly don't recommend this location at all. Our orders were also incorrect and took forever to correct. I'm sure they would do better if they hired more people it would run a lot better."}
{"text":"My family and I recently relocated here and were excited to try something new. The name is about the only positive thing this establishment has going for it.   The waiter brought menus and as we attempted to order our drinks, he turned and walked away. I could understand if the place was slammed, but there were two tables with a total of 11 patrons in the restaurant, 4 of them being seated at the bar.  Once we placed our drink orders, the service was quick, but sub par. Our waiter walked by our table of empty drink glasses several times and we still had to ask for refills. The food was mediocre, but nowhere near \"world famous nachos\" as they proclaim. We were served a plate of toppings on a very tiny bed of soggy chips.   If you enjoy subpar service, mediocre food with ridiculous prices attached, this is definitely the place for you."}
{"text":"We ordered the chilaquiles, shrimp nachos and a taco.  Chilaquiles weren't bad but the rest won't bring us back. Service was 5 star though; cute gal with black rimmed glasses (sorry, forgot her name)."}
{"text":"Love this place. Jovanny was AMAZING! Best check in with a free marg! The wings were so good and the bbq sauce was spicy but delicious. The filet mignon nachos were amazing!"}
{"text":"Great place just off the strip. Bar atmosphere was the best. Arnold makes the best margs - will visit again next month when my hubby and I are back in town."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, an amazing bartender Davor, helped me choose my drink. He is very knowledgeable, nice and friendly. Just ask for Davor if you want to get awesome drinks. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is not good or worth the price. The nachos are a joke and has no flavor the nachos reminds me of denny's nachos a lot of shitty pace picante with a lot of lettuce and no flavor. There must be a lot of Midwestern that don't know decent Mexican American food that this has a high rating"}
{"text":"Came in for late night Beer and chips and salsa.  Got a pitcher of Beer and the triple dip. Salsa, queso and guacamole.  Very good and Shawn took great care of us. Sat outside ..the weather was great."}
{"text":"Great little spot. Nachos were awesome. Good beer selection and house margarita was very good. Service was great."}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere, awesome servers! Definitely a place to eat at. Especially if you like nachos!!"}
{"text":"So I had no clue what this business was going to be. I had received adverts for it but thought it was some sort of mexi fast food.  I knew it wasn't going to be that if they moved into the old firefly building.  Decided to go on a tuesday and had the chicken tacos.  I'm GF and the chips/tacos were brilliant. Happy is hours are from 3-6pm each day and they have a brilliant Vegan menu to boot. Give it a go, I have only had experience at the bar and last night was when I was there last. Cheers I do enjoy the new faux wood in the bar and the 80's videos."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars very often but they definitely earned each one. The server, AJ had a great attitude and told us all about his amazing week and was very knowledgeable about the menu and all the specials in the restaurant. I am so impressed with the size of the Vegan menu as my girlfriend is vegan and she was very happy. There is something on the menu for everyone. The only downside was one of my friends meals didn't make it out before everyone else had finished theirs. As soon as we notified AJ he quickly acknowledged and noted it would not be on the bill but it would be on the table. Even the manager came out and identified the problem and told us it was not going to be billed. If i lived in LV i would definitely be a regular! Wonderful service, staff and food. Perfect for our first brunch in LV"}
{"text":"This place has a great ambience and i really like the food here.  Basic ingredients but when prepared well they are very tasty.  Ally was our server and she was so helpful with our menu choices. Btw is she a swimsuit model or olympic gold medal runner?  I would def buy wheaties if she was on the cover. People like her make the experience better.  Ill def come back for the food as well as service."}
{"text":"With a name like Nacho Daddy...this place did not dissapoint....Great ambience, wonderful flavors, excellent service. Had a few Mexican dishes. ..absolutely wonderful   Endorsed by a real Mexican"}
{"text":"Best margaritas in town!!! A big thank you to Jovany and Serena for your hospitality!!"}
{"text":"Hmmm, when I came to write my review, yelp gave me a warning that there were multiple reviews completed from the same IP address for this restaurant. Anywho, the smothered burrito was very subpar to say this is a Mexican restaurant. The southwest egg rolls were typical frozen section egg rolls. Both the buffalo and BBQ chicken nachos were really good. The daddy margarita and house margarita were good, but missing alcohol. We left with no buzz at all. I would suggest going here for the nachos and a photo opp with the scorpion shot, ONLY! We went during happy hour and had coupons. The bartenders also go from touching everything from money to hair to cleaning without washing their hands. Totally not sanitary! But, no big deal if you're already drunk, right? lol"}
{"text":"Awesome meal - great food, great service! Chase was amazing. He kept all our drinks full and impressed my kids with how new Arnold Palmers kept magically appearing on the table.  The food was delicious - my husband had the Supreme Tostada nachos and devoured them. He loves nachos and orders them at restaurants everywhere, trying to find the best ones, and Nacho Daddy did not disappoint.  My daughter loved her enchilada nachos, and my son (who doesn't really care for Mexican food) found his perfect entree in the Nacho Average Burger Nachos, which was basically a cheeseburger on top of chips. I had the seafood nachos - lobster, crab, white queso, black beans, and a mango salsa/sweet chili sauce. They tasted amazing, and we were surprised and delighted to have them comped because there was a delay in my dish coming out.  The kitchen manager came out personally to tell us, and he was super courteous and apologetic. We didn't mind a little wait, but the great service and extra consideration made us loyal customers and we will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"This place has good food at a reasonable price for the strip. The service is great. All day breakfast (which is great for waking up at 1pm in Vegas), but I love the name! You don't know me.... I am Nacho Daddy!! :-)"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong ordering nachos here. They're delicious, I got one of their signature nachos and fried ice cream to share. My problem with this restaurant was the service. Our waitress was nice, but in the beginning of the meal we showed her a 50% off nacho coupon, and she said we would be able to use it. Now, I'm not sure what happened in that half hour or so but the coupon was gone by the time we got the check. I'm pretty sure the waitress took the coupon when we showed it to her, but either way she wouldn't give it to us. I would have liked to speak with a manager but I was too distracted by the table behind us. They asked to move seats and their waiter seemed really annoyed with their request. I saw him roll his eyes when he turned away and he was swearing the whole time under his breath. Really vulgar things. I was honestly shocked. Obviously the table being served couldn't hear him but I could.  Verdict: good food, but not so family-friendly language and rude servers. If you like to hear the waiter drop the f-bomb several times about the table behind you, this is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Check in and get a free house margarita try the Mexican candy margarita it's amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Customer service was ok however Nachos was not.  I ordered Chicken Bar B Que Nachos and Mexican corn. Love the corn but the Nachos was a little dry.  They were light on adding corn, cheese and beans on the Nachos but the meat portion was good."}
{"text":"Let's get the bad out of the way- service, while very friendly, was a tad slow. At one point our waitress vanished and I couldn't get a water refill, but when she was on point, she was very on point. Side note- she was very cute and had a rocking hair cut. Anyway, randomly picked Nacho Daddy for a night out with my friends after we finished our conference responsibilities for the trip and we wanted nothing more than to get away from the conference center and down the strip for some food (and refreshments for my friends, which I passed on). The waitress gave great recommendations. Between the four of us we got the cheese enchiladas, the filet mignon nachos, lobster tacos, mini fish tacos, and the Mexican corn. I had the corn and the fish tacos.   The corn was tasty but not the best I've had -it was very, very light on the cojita cheese, and the seasoning was only on side of the corn, and barely had any crema. Elote is one of my favourite foods, so I was a tad disappointed. The fish tacos were tasty, I liked the mango salsa. My friends enjoyed their food and drinks as well. The servings were humongous, and the prices were reasonable- and it must have been happy hour because my tacos were discounted. I asked about the Yelp check in but it was after we ordered and apparently we didn't have the right kind of margarita, but definitely take them up on that, it's a great offer.   Would definitely try the nachos if I were to ever return, I just felt like getting something with more protein than cheese (full disclosure, I'm pescetarian- I did like the option of the vegan menu but wanted to try two smaller menu items instead. Would try them in the future if I were to return though!). The decor and vibe of the place was great and we were seated in a cozy booth with a good view of the open kitchen!"}
{"text":"We are here twice while in Vegas for a convention and had great food & service both times! Great margaritas!"}
{"text":"Mango and blood orange margaritas are amazing!!!! I recommend the enchilada nachos. They're super yummy and a great portion! Oh and Tiffany is an awesome server! Such a fun place :) will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We visited on a Saturday around 4 pm.  I had the ghost chili nachos, which are listed on the menu as having chicken. Mine had beef. I was hungry and I didn't send them back. They weren't very spicy, but were tasty and yet needed more chili flavor. The portion was good for the price and it's definitely a meal.  The menu lists \"all day breakfast\", which we would have ordered, but our server said it's a no go on breakfast. Disappointing. My friend liked the potato chip nachos and I found them tasty also. The decor is fine and they have TVs showing some sports broadcast all over the restaurant. My favorite thing about this location is the self serve beer station. I regret to say that I didn't patronize the station, which had a nice selection and would make for a fun afternoon/evening!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food & all recommendations from our waiter were wonderful.  Large portions too.  I tried the fish tacos, really good.  We also had the burrito, excellent with sides of rice & beans.  Just off the strip less than 1/2 block & so worth it to experience it.  Woody decor inside with an upper & lower level."}
{"text":"Celebrating my bachelorette party here night 1! Free margaritas with yelp check in! Yes please! Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes YES. The most killer Mexican food in the coolest restaurant set up! Right off of the strip, free parking right behind - Planet Hollywood - what more could I ask for?  Any of their breakfast items are amazing. The menu is huge and so hard to choose from because it all sounds mouthwatering! We got the pulled pork nachos and they were some of the best that I've ever had. They will be my Nacho Daddy forever."}
{"text":"Jovanny was  the best!!!   Awesome server and made our trip worthwhile!!!  Be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"This is the site of closed Firefly, so decent looking place. Decent mexican food, nothing original, and nice bartender. But the waitress service was terrible. Had to ask for glass of water 3 times.  Got the 2-person fajitas. It came with decent amount of fajitas, but only 6 tortillas. Again, this is a 2 person share. Asked for more tortillas 3 times, and then told they aren't allowed to give more tortillas. Are you kidding me? Tortillas are a penny a piece, if that. What are these people thinking?  First mexican place I have ever heard of that limits tortillas. Big judgement error guys. Save a penny, lost a local customer. Forever."}
{"text":"So far so good! Love the ambiance I just wish I would have made reservations. Messed that one up. But we are going to wait.   I forgot my update: IT WAS DEFINITELY WORTH THE WAIT! We will be back! Delicious!"}
{"text":"We randomly picked this spot because my wife felt like nachos and a margarita. Well this place nailed both of these things! We will definitely be back whenever we come to Vegas. Hope they decide to open a restaurant in souther California."}
{"text":"Im a local and have been to this location about 3 or 4 times now. Service is always pretty slow, takes about 20 minutes to get the drink order every time and they're always short staffed. Love the food and the fact that they have a vegan section on their menu... but this time around I ordered a vegan chicken taco salad and was brought a salad with actual chicken, and when I had it sent back they brought me the correct order but with real cheese. Other locations around the valley are great."}
{"text":"Holy crap, if I could have sex with these nachos I would. You simply cannot order something you won't like here. Impossible. And for those of you crazy not to get nachos, they do have many other offerings comparable to a full-access Mexican restaurant. But get the nachos. Unless you're against mouth orgasms, and America."}
{"text":"Found this spot on our Vegas trip, food was very good and the vibes are cool! You get a lot for what you pay for. Favorite restaurant in Vegas so far"}
{"text":"I was a part of a very large group that we had previously arranged to be there, so the staff was prepared and the space was available. I was there at least an hour and only saw my waitress once for drink orders, as she handed us the menu. We asked for water, it never came, nor did someone to take our order for food. A big group of us were never taken care of, and we were right in the middle of everything. I know others in the group had a similar issue, their food never came out. The service was pretty terrible, I could understand if we just showed up with 50 people out of the blue, but we had arranged for it. They knew we were coming. I ended up leaving without eating or anything. The food looked great from what I saw, but the service was something else."}
{"text":"Amazing nachos and Ambiance. We had an awesome waitress! Definitely one of the Vegas strips hidden gems. I loved our vegan friendly they were!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and great nachos. Had the Thai chicken that was delicious, but the shrimp one was on the bland side for me. Nacho portions were small but nicely presented on a hotplate."}
{"text":"When we got here we got fast service from Serena . She was amazing and very helpful. UnfortunatelyI got gum that was stuck under the table on my new shirt. She was so nice to get me club soda but it didn't work . Her manager Peter offered to give me one of their t-shirts , have mine dry cleaned , and pay for my nachos . Best service u ever had . Most places don't care . Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Good food and great prices for being right off of the strip. The portions were big and good to share between two people. The staff was really friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We loved our server Julie, she's #1. We could not have a better server. She was extremely attentive and helpful. She was so informed about the menu and her recommendations were spot on. I loved the kale salad and hope they keep that on the menu for a long time. It was perfect. I don't need to eat fat on fat in Vegas everyday, so Nacho Daddy was perfect. The nachos were AWESOME! Generous portions and a real value for the Strip. I also liked the coffee. They serve French Press. So I was able to get three cups out of it and feel like I was awake after a long night staying up. I highly recommend this place and it's a great place to relax and get off the beaten path. Everyone at the restaurant was attentive and friendly. Huge plus, the place is extremely clean and spacious!! Thank you Nacho Daddy!!"}
{"text":"Definitely recommend the Crab & Lobster nachos! Very big portion sizes so it's definitely shareable between two. We ordered the chip trio (queso, spinach & artichoke dip & salsa). Absolutely fantastic! Great service, food & environment. I stopped by here while on vacation, but I will definitely be back if I'm ever in town again."}
{"text":"I came here last night for happy hour and was pleasantly surprised... I am not a fan of Mexican food and had frequented the Firefly that was previously here so I was not quite sure to expect.   They have a decent happy hour menu - $5 dollar house margaritas (and they didn't skimp on booze). I was happy with the food on the happy hour menu as it wasn't all carbs. I had the ceviche and I have no complaints. The grilled corn tempted me too.  I don't really have anything negative to say. Perhaps they could have free chips and salsa? (I was always a fan of the bread/weird butter at Firefly)  I would go back.. and I know my friends definitely will (they live much closer)."}
{"text":"I go here alllll the time or downtown.. very nice bartenders and made great friends from going here moved here 3 years ago and love nacho daddy ... I love the tostada nacho with a big margarita sounds like a great time !!!!"}
{"text":"I came here one night after hanging out in Fremont with my wife and friends . I ordered the naked hot and bbq wings , I eaten two when I was working in my third wing and noticed the chicken was red and pink in the inside ! They served me rAw chicken ! I sent it back the guy apologize and asked if I wanted more made ! Hell No , u only get one chance to kill me ! My wife ordered some type of shrimp taco and hated it ! All she ate was the shrimp out of the taco . We also order queso dip and chips and the was the best part of the meal !"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and it was busy.  Waited forever only to find our that they had crossed our name off 20 minutes earlier because they don't communicate.  Both greeters started arguing about who's fault it was.  After being stated the waiter took our orders but no drinks and no refills afterwards.  My nachos were very good, my wife's fajita salad was drenched in vinegar (drenched).   It is worth trying once, but due to poor service and not so good food  we won't go back.    After writing this review I had a message from Nacho Daddy management offering to review my experience with their restaurant.    As a consumer it is refreshing to see that they do listen and want to make an effort to provide a quality experience.  Thank you Nacho Daddy"}
{"text":"I while I am tempted to say, \"I've never met a nacho I didn't like\", that would be untrue - I am a picky nacho eater. I am passionate about my nachos and Nacho Daddy did not disappoint! The nacho menu options were broad and included both traditional and more interesting toppings. I ordered the Supreme Taco Nachos, which our excellent server Ryan \"spiced up\" by adding hot salsa and extra jalapeños! The ratio of toppings to chips was good with the toppings distributed throughout the chips so there were very few plain chips. The toppings were not too wet which helped avoid \"chip sog\". Thumbs up to the nachos!  In addition to nachos, the Nacho Daddy menu offered lots of choices including delicious-looking appetizers, soups, salads, tacos, burros, enchiladas and more. The drink options, including a full bar, also added to the enjoyment.   We will definitely return...perhaps tonight!"}
{"text":"Do not waste your time.  The service was great but the food was way over priced.  I left there feeling robbed. Had better food from other Mexican restaurants at a cheaper price. Will never come here again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Good was really good, cool little atmosphere. Servers and the manager were all really awesome! Jiovanny (manager) is a really cool guy and made our night just that much more special. Highly recommend.  I live in Vegas and had family in town, they picked this spot. You can guarantee that I will be back, even as a local resident in Vegas. Had a really great experience! It is easy to leave a negative review, but the positive ones are harder to come by. Just wanted to share my experience in the hopes it helps others."}
{"text":"This place was great and affordable.  What made the experience stand out though was MJ, our server.  She was friendly, fun, and provided great recommendations.  I will return the next time I am in Vegas!?"}
{"text":"Stopped in to watch the USA soccer game and get some happy hour.  Lots of foot munchies   I recommend the carne asada street tacos and the potato nachos were very good.  The beer, on happy hour, was good and cold."}
{"text":"Food was great, definitely get what you pay for.  Service wasn't the best but considering it was super busy I don't see the point in fussing about it our server lee was attentive and we did get what we asked for in a timely manor."}
{"text":"Awesome spot! We had a great server named Jovanny. He's so friendly and makes your visit here feel like home. Great service! We are visiting from LA and decided to try some new spots. I definitely recommend this place! And thank you to Jovanny for taking care of us and our 1 year old while we dined here! We tried the Vegan Loaded Nachos and Filet Mignon Nachos.. both were very yummy! Both had a good spicy kick as well. Also tried the House Margarita, not overly strong and very tasty."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and I highly recommend it!! I dined here on Wednesday for my birthday lunch and it did not disappoint. The service and food were fantastic!! Our server Huck was so much fun and very attentive. Chris, the GM, brought me a special birthday shot, on the house!! Good service is hard to find these days but Nacho Daddy has it! My friends and I have already said that we will be going back every time we visit Vegas. Thank you for the memorable birthday!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Kimberly was the best bartender! The way she put the limes on our scorpion shots was incredibly elegant! 10 out of 10, would recommend and go visit her!"}
{"text":"Fun place and the food is pretty good but the service left something to be desired.  Matt waited on us today and he didn't check back on us one time after food was delivered. I finished my tacos and never got hot sauce. .  That being said, the ambiance is cool and margaritas are decent but not strong at all.  We will try again and hope for better service."}
{"text":"Mark took great care of us...the drinks were flowin' at a reasonable price!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good and customer service was above average. I'd recommend as a quick lunch and margarita for anyone hitting Vegas"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite place to eat nachos in town.  So bummed the Henderson location is gone, as I don't get downtown as much.  Terrific Nachos and good food overall.  Good selection of cocktails, always good service and kids eat free on Mondays!!  One of the best places in town---I bring out of town guests and they rave about it..."}
{"text":"Jovanny was the best server/supervisor I've had a restaurant in years. Awesome customer service, extremely friendly, very outgoing, keeps a smile on his face and made us feel at home."}
{"text":"SO yummy! Stopped here with a group of 5 after walking the Strip all day long- needless to say we were ready for drinks and just about starving.  We ordered margaritas and the dip trio to start.. salsa and gauc were both okay but the queso was thebomb.com... (do people still say that!?)  Anyway, I ordered the surf and turf tacos (steak and lobster) and they were both awesome.  Everyone else at the table enjoyed their meals too- most ordered nachos (obviously!).. I would definitely come back here.. wish there was one closer to home!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and had chicken tortilla soup and filet mignon nachos. They were both so good.  Food is fresh and tortilla chips are delicious. Service was excellent. A must try place."}
{"text":"This is the worst location for all the nacho daddy in Vegas. Nacho daddy is actually a good place for food but this one on the strip sucks. Let's talk about  it. I am a local and came in for happy hour and obviously set at the bar. The bartender her name started with a C and she was Caucasian with dreads. She literally distributes the worst customer service known to man. We had to ask repeatedly for water, our alcohol drinks and sour cream. She didn't care; she was in her own rude world. I felt neglected as a customer; she made cynical comments like \"I work for tips\" etc. I complained to the host and asked for a manager but one never came over. Just avoid this location . Please note it wasn't busy and we received no silverware !"}
