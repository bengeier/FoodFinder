{"text":"My mom (who is Polish) suggested we come here to try it. The outdoor patio is spacious with comfortable seating. We had pierogies, which were made with homemade pasta and they tasted like the ones mom used to make! We also had the pork shank, sauerkraut, potatoes and brussel sprouts. The portion was nice and that was flavorful as well. We capped off dinner with some Croatian doughnuts with homemade sauces. Delish! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent all of it!!! Octopus appetizer I highly recommend. I had the crab stuffed cod. The fish was cooked perfectly. My husband had the beef stroganoff & he loved it! I had the crepes for dessert the berries & bananas hit the spot. My guy had the creme brûlée he kept saying \"I don't want this to end.\" Our waiter Vilmer was great, excellent service. Throughly enjoyed our dining experience. Great ambiance even had live music."}
{"text":"Really fantastic lunch! Beautiful decor and exquisite food very artfully presented.  Gina, our server, could not do enough to make our lunch special. We'll be back for Brunch Sunday and dinner February 9th.  Want as many people to try it as I want it to do well.  Price was surprisingly moderate given the quality and abundance of the food. It is not off Scottsdale Rd as the site indicates, but west of Scottsdale Rd on Gold Dust."}
{"text":"Great food, live music, and romantic atmosphere. We had a party of 19 and our servers, Hazor and Brad were on top of everything! They were awesome!"}
{"text":"Every time I go there, food portions getting smaller and smaller. We went for Father's Day, they did not have pork shashlik, so had to substitute with chicken, four small pieces of chicken to be precise. I found LONG HAIR In the vegetables and called our waiter. She decided to give us 15% discount. This place has bad service and you get free hair with the meal."}
{"text":"I have been to Sonata several times and always enjoy my experience.  It's great to see the differing cultures who enjoy Sonata.  Great food with unique choices.  On my last visit Hazan was very attentive, very friendly and answered our questions about the menu."}
{"text":"Really beautiful ambiance, love the cool Eastern European flare to it. You can tell they really care about their food, they present you old school cuisine with a modern twist. My fav item tonight was the  kepta duona it was just devine. Servers have been great both times we went, both Brad and Kevin were very helpful in elaborating on the different meals as well as drinks that they served. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale and I will be coming here often."}
{"text":"We dined at Sonata's Saturday night for the first time , it had been recommended by a friend. We were very impressed with the decor , the artwork and the atmosphere. After looking at the appetizers, we decided to make a meal of them and ordered 4 . Sauerkraut soup, Beef Pierogie, Foie Gras, and Herring. Each one was not only authentic , fresh and contemporary but presented beautifully ! Oops ! We also decided to try the \"Funeral Potatoes\" - fantastic! We couldn't finish it all , but had to have a taste. Next visit we can't wait to try the main entrees . Our server Nathalie was delightful and we would request her again. Deividas the owner is young, friendly and in my opinion has made his mark in Scottsdale, in just under 2 month. Welcome to the Valley, you are a refreshing change to the restaurant scene. Reservations are recommended- it was full the night we were there.  For my husband ( Russian decent) and I ( Lithuanian decent)  this is comfort food , held to the highest standard. A great evening!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just finished dining here tonight. We came here due to my client recommendation. The decor of the restaurant is absolutely beautiful, more like a modern twist. Ambiance was very nice and there's was live music there tonight. Everything about this restaurant is great- BUT one thing did fall short was that I find the portion here is not quite balance. I had 1/2 roast duck entree and literally it is half a duck serve on a platter. Duck meat is tend to have more give no matter how you cook it- it's not gonna be fork tender. I was struggling how to cut the duck plus the regular knife couldn't cut it well. I had to request for a sharper knife and that help a little bit better. I literally felt the only way to eat the duck was to roll up my sleeve and devour it like cave man styles. Thank god, I was not on a first date. Lol.. My boyfriend had the braised beef pirogies and it was delicious but there was ONLY 4 large ravioli size on his plate. It should had been more like an appetizer versus an entree. As I look across the room, eyeing on what other people is having. I noticed a waiter brought this guy his dinner and it was some sort of kabob.. I kid you not, the kabob was as long as a sword. He sure got his money worth it for food. Overall, the flavor and food here is great. But the portion on some the dishes is lacking and unbalance. I dropped $130 for dinner (tip included) and we both went home hungry."}
{"text":"My mother and I go out to lunch together often, and we are rarely impressed with the food we eat.  Sonata's was an exception for both of us.  To begin with, the Artesian salad was to die for, one of the best I have ever had!  The Short Rib Strogonoff was both extremely tender, flavorful, and made with homemade noodles.  Our server, Gina, was both friendly, attentive, and a positive, supportive representative of the restaurant and its food.  The outdoor seating was comfortable and scenic.  We would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service, our server Velimir was attentive and pleasant. Food came out in reasonable time and order.  Overall nice experience."}
{"text":"Great dinner, service and ambiance! Hazar was our server and was so attentive ..personable but not overbearing. Started with perogies, the fried rye bread with delicious melted cheese and the beet salad..the short rib pot roast and chicken kabob for dinner and creme brulee. All of it was delicious! Would recommend and can't wait to go back for cocktails!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating here with friends and family twice this week while visiting the Scottsdale area. True European cuisine is difficult to find and this one took me back to my childhood. I enjoyed the authentic dishes. From Kepta Duona, Borscht, and Chicken Kotleti as appetizers, Kohlrabi and shaved apple salad,  to the decadent entrees of Short Run Stroganoff, uniquely prepared Hay Roasted Lamb Persillade, and my favorite Dutch oven crab stuffed Cod \"Zuvis Su Pomidorais\"... You can not go wrong. Worth the trip! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Caren our server was a delight. She was helpful sweet and funny. She suggested my boyfriend and I try the rye bread sautéed in duck fat aoli with cheese. I can't remember the proper name for this appetizer, however it was delightful. The seasoning was perfect and the taste was out of this world!  There was even a singer singing Frank Sinatra songs while we dined in a beautiful dining room. We will be back to try the perogies and duck fries.     Thank you Caren! I hope you win the contest, u are a sweetheart."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful inside.   We enjoyed our meal because of our waiter, Hazar.   We had a long wait for our meal because of a very large party that cane in before us,  but he made it up to us by supplying us with wine and dessert.   Because of this, we'll give Sonata a try again."}
{"text":"We have been here 3 times so far and getting impressed with the food every time! Any appetizer or meal we have tried has been unique and delicious. We also love the ambiance and the live music. The juice bar is a plus. I recommend it for a small or large group."}
{"text":"Very nicely decorated and appointed restaurant with tons of attention to every detail. The service was very good; our server - Hazar - was knowledgeable about the menu, attentive and efficient; he made the meal very enjoyable -- will definitely return and will certainly ask for Hazar!!!. Only negative is that the portions are rather small for the price charged per entree'."}
{"text":"I hate to let any more people know about this fabulous restaurant. It is a Jewel in in Scottsdale. Excellent food that you cannot find everywhere. Fresh ingredients well-prepared. My husband and I enjoy sitting at the bar and having a cocktail and our food the bartenders are very friendly and provide excellent service."}
{"text":"We went to sonatas today.  First time.  Loved the watermelon water drink although my buddy ate the watermelon garnish on top.  The watermelon drink was very light and not too sweet.  We met Dominic, our bartender who was very personable and informative.  We also met one of the owners, David, and enjoyed chatting with him as well.  My friend, the watermelon thief, tried the cabbage roll and absolutely loved it.    We will be enjoying the leftovers for breakfast.  I enjoyed the soup of the day which was called sour kraut but was more like a cabbage soup and I thought it was delicious.  I usually avoid soups because they tend to be too salty, and I'm not into very much salt.    In short we were very happy campers at Sonatas today.  I love to try new dishes wherever I go.  However, my friend will be probably stuck on those cabbage rolls every time.  I can't say I blame him."}
{"text":"Stunning decor... great service... delicious food...highly recommend...our waiter Brad was extremely knowledgeable and made the evening even more delightful..."}
{"text":"The kepta duona was very good and the atmosphere is really nice. The live music was lovely! Caren was our server and she was really helpful and sweet."}
{"text":"Relaxed and beautiful atmosphere. Brad, our server, gave us excellent service. The food is unique and delicious. It is a wonderful departure from some of the typical fare of the area.  Will definitely return and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Myself and my wife visited on Saturday and was highly impressed with both the quality of food and the interaction of the staff. Food was just amazing , service was quick but not rushed, Will behind the bar was attentive and informative, we had to good fortune to meet with the beautiful Sonata herself along with her husband Paul who went out of their way to ensure all was in order, I would strongly recommend this Restaurant , we will be back.  Thanks Sonata,  John and Alison"}
{"text":"I came here November 21, 2017 for happy hour with 20 friends. I made the reservations 2 weeks ahead, and then called again the day before, to confirm. They actually RAN OUT OF FOOD? How does that happen? My friends wanted the beef sliders and flatbread from the happy hour menu, and the only items left on the HH menu were things like oysters, duck fat and pork belly. They have strange food here. If that is what you like, maybe you will like it. They claim it is European, but a friend who is European also said the food was weird.  Also, one of the reasons I wanted to come here was because of the lovely decor. But we were seated by the rear entrance, overlooking cars in the parking lot, while the rest of the place was empty. Service was poor. The bartender was the person there. We was a nice guy, but I had to call him over every time we needed service or to order something else. With so many places in town, why would we come here again?"}
{"text":"We love Gina! She helped us experience new food and drinks! I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"This restaurant exceeded our expectations. From the service, to the ambiance, to the food (which was incredible), we were so very impressed. We had the cabbage rolls, potato pancakes with salmon, and the beef stroganoff. Everything was well presented and absolutely delicious. The wine list was extensive and provided great wines by the glass and by the bottle. We loved the live music on a Thursday (which was happening). Can't wait to enjoy the patio bar and try more dishes because we will be back."}
{"text":"Food and service was great! Ambiance was great as well. Really cool decor. Would recommend to anyone who wants to try! Brad was very attentive and very knowledgeable. He gives great service!"}
{"text":"EVERYTHING WAS GREAT! Atmosphere, music, food, and customer service. Great restaurant 10/10 recommend. The octopus is straight from spain and delicious as was the cod and beef stroganoff. Hazar was our server and he topped the night off. He gave us great recommendations on places to go while visiting Arizona and was all around a great server. Ohhhh and try their prize winning dessert, it's to die for."}
{"text":"Great service from our waitress Karen. Great menu selections, nice ambience, and entertainment to boot. Recommend highly!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, seated right away. Pleasant staff from hostess to waiter Hazar! We shared two dishes which chef split for us and even served in two courses! Make sure you eat potato pancake when eating tender trout! No sauce needed! Overall a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I'm not a yelper but I'm making an exception tonight..... slow service, awful cheesy entertainment and flavorless trout. Trust me, Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place has an incredible menu. The bartender served us and he was really accommodating, got our questions about the food answered, and made great drinks. We had the Borscht, the Perogies, and  Smoked Beef Short Rib Stroganoff. It was all excellent.  We've only been once and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very cozy feeling, like I'm eating dinner at my Bulgarian friends home. Everything is excellent from the food to the service. My only gripe and the only reason I give 4 stars is because the food can be a little too salty."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. Amazing food, attentive service and beautiful decor"}
{"text":"I grew up with stuffed cabbage, but these were seriously the best I've had, so unique in flavor. Also all the varieties I tried were great! We shared the souffle and the napolean for dessert, both were amazing. We will definitely return, and tell our friends!"}
{"text":"Another great evening.  Sonata's menu is wonderful and their staff is excellent.  Just enough great food to feel satisfied with room for one of their super deserts.  We keep coming back.  This is our favorite Scottsdale restaurant.  Tonight our server was Caren I. and she was friendly, helpful, fun and kept us well cared for.   This is a beautiful place with great ambiance.  It is a pleasure to enter and just enjoy!    We made reservations tonight for Valentines Day.  A special menu and pricing.  We are looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Shortly after they opened stopped in for lunch. Had a great meal and the service was OK. 4 stars.  Week later my wife and I stopped in for Happy Hour and sat at the bar. Enjoyed the burger, Croquet sandwich-(sp), fried rye with melted havarti was killer and $5 premium draft beers! Again enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere. 5 stars! Best HH in town!   Now comes the fun part...went again for happy hour last week on a week night. HH Hour Menu has changed from the one here on Yelp and their website. Gone are the burger, ruben, croquet sandwich and only a couple of beers are $5..premiums are now $7. Pointed it out to one of the many managers and he responded by making a call on his cell phone.  I understand that changes are made..but pretty quick for a new place trying for people to come, enjoy and return. Color me gone. Food and service was good...manager blew it big time.  Which brings me to my last point. If you should go play the highly entertaining game of count the staff! The place is not too big but I counted 2 behind the bar, 2-3 hostesses, 13 wait staff, 6 in the kitchen and a gaggle of owners-managers huddled together or talking on their cell phones. Labor costs must be killing them..hence the menu changes? Then again it is not too uncommon to overstaff and then let attrition do it's thing. I wish them well but don't be surprised if things continue to change."}
{"text":"My husband I dined in Sonata last night.  We had Salmon & potato pancake appetizer, Chicken Kiev style and stuffed cabbage.   All the food was awesome.  I don't know what they did to make the chicken so good.  It was very different from anything I had in this country.  The cabbage was different from the Hungarian ones we are used to, but very good.  The appetizer is something I will try to copy for my next party.   The people at the next table were having cauliflower appetizer.  It's on my list to try next time.  Oh also the service was great.  My husband felt a little cold since we were one of the first ones in the restaurant for the day (later on warmed up as we had more guests).  One restaurant employee brought in very comfy and clean blankets for him.  I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is only average, and some of grilled vegetables were completely undercooked. Potions are on a small side, and they charge you for bread. The cocktail had hardly any alcohol. The service was fine."}
{"text":"The music and the atmosphere was awesome and the menu looks great the food however is just So so!"}
{"text":"I've tried to lodge a formal complaint about this restaurant on their website, but it wouldn't submit. I had a group of 10 people at your restaurant for an important client dinner on Monday April 16. Our event planner had selected your restaurant, as well as several others for other of our groups, to schedule our dinners that night. She had called ahead to arrange the details. The table that was set wasn't large enough, we didn't order appetizers for at least 45 minutes, you didn't have most of the wine choices we requested, the service was extremely slow. My guests got up from table to retrieve the wine from the ice bucket to refill their wine glasses. We had several clients from Europe and the east coast - so these delays were difficult for them. I asked a few waiters and bar tender to speed things up. Bar tender stated he was already trying to help. I was told the manager was on site, but he never came over. No apologies, no accountability. When it came time for dessert, I asked all guests not to order dessert as we would be there even longer. The entire experience was unacceptable. It was the story among all of the groups the next day. I would like to get a response from your management. Thank you."}
{"text":"Reservations were easy and the day of received a reminder call.  Upon arrival taken to a nice outside table which we had requested.  Note if you sit by their outdoor fire pit it can be a little smelly due to the product used to fire the pit.   First off the service was horrible.  We waited over 10 minutes for water to be offered.   Our main server, Brad, was training someone which we feel is a HUGE mistake.  He was less than attentive, mixed up drink orders and never asked if our table wanted a bottle of wine with our meal or after dinner drinks.  He even charged us for a drink that was WRONG and didn't bring a second glass of vino that had been ordered (10 minutes had passed, at least). Our meals ranged from burgers (over cooked from the medium well request), chicken kiev, schnitzel, reuben, soup of the day, stroganoff.  Only the stroganoff was tasty and satisfying.  We all ate just a portion of our meals.  Those of us who took leftovers home threw them out the next day....not worth the second try.   One bright spot was the live music.  Excellent and we were tempted to sit in the bar at the end of our evening.   BUT as a group decided we did not want to give any more money to this establishment. Went elsewhere for our nightcap. With out of town visitors frequently we would not recommend this restaurant given the plethora of choices throughout the valley!  We drove 40 minutes to try this place out as the menu looked enticing despite the service reviews from other patrons."}
{"text":"Awasome place. Very nice and helpfull stuff.Food is very tasty. I will come back again for sure !!!!!!!)"}
{"text":"Sonata's had a booth at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival with a unique dish- Kepta Duona. Explained as a crispy rye bread with duck fat aioli and Havarti cheese sauce. This was one of the best tastes at the fest and w had to try the restaurant. Went there last Saturday and sat at the bar... From the moment we walked in the door to the time we left the experience was amazing. Easily one of the best experiences I've had at a restaurant... Our bartender/mixologist's name was Will. It's not very often where you find someone as passionate about their trade as Will. We told him we came in because of the experience at the festival. Will took us down a path I will never forget. He made the most amazing drinks and walked us through the menu. Words can't explain how good this guy is at mixing drinks. They were all unique and delicious. The Kepta Duona was so good it would be worth making a trip just for that...   The restaurant was surprisingly quiet for a Saturday evening. Our understanding is they had challenges when they first opened... if you're reading this and you were part of those challenges, I'd highly recommend you give it another chance..."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast. I can't wait to come back for dinner. The service is great, the drinks and dishes are economical and nicely done. They put flourish into everything, from the emasculate and well designed main dining room down to the presentations on the drinks.   Fantastic and I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The restaurant has dynamic decor with lots of different seating areas including a large covered patio with a bar. We were seated next to the most interesting wall of log ends. We were there on a Friday evening and enjoyed the live piano music which seemed to cover every era and style of music. Really pleasant and fun.  Food was creative, delicious and we topped it off with super yummy desert perogis. Service on that busy night was a bit slow, but the entertainment made it ok."}
{"text":"It was the first day of restaurant week so my husband, myself and another couple decided to try Sonata's for the first time yesterday (Friday night).  After looking at their very interesting and delicious sounding dishes offered on their regular menu we decided to bypass the restaurant week choices and ordered from their regular menu.  It wasn't too crowded but just enough dinners to give it some atmosphere.  Our waiter was a bit odd and quirky as he described some of their dishes and answered our questions about the menu.  He needs to be retrained because honestly he did not make the dishes sound good,  We each ordered our drinks and appetizers and our main courses....and that is where the \"waiting\" started.  We received our drinks 15 minutes later.  30 minutes later our waiter stops by the table to ask if we wanted another drink.  We ordered another round of drinks but still no appetizers.    After waiting for over 45 minutes for the appetizers my friend went to look for the manager.  The manager did not apologize for the delay but instead told my friend that we would have our apps soon.  One hour and a half later we finally received our apps and our starter salads. The hummus/tapenade  and the pierogies apps were very good as were the salads.  At the time our apps arrived our waiter stopped by our table & apologized for the delay, he also told us that three of their cooks had just quit that morning and that they were extremely short staffed. (still not a word from the GM)   Once we were done with our apps we were so tired of waiting that all we wanted to do was leave and at that point one of the owners stopped by our table.  He apologized for everything and then went on to tell us a different reason for the disastrous night.  He stated that they had computer issues that created a back up in the kitchen.  We did end up comping us for the night and suggested that we give them another try.    We really wanted to like this restaurant, it's got so much going for it....great location, beautiful decor, live music, a nice interesting menu, good apps & salads but it's lacking good timely service.  You should't have to wait over an hour just to get your apps, especially if the restaurant is not even that busy.    Note to owners:  If you are foreseeing service delay issues you should tell your patrons in advance and give them the option of either staying and being prepared to wait or to go somewhere else that night and try your restaurant another time."}
{"text":"What a surprising and delightfully unique find in Scottsdale! Our first time here and we were treated really well by our server Brad. We had a hard time choosing but ended up starting with the Kepta Duona (seriously amazing and delicious), the Chicken Kiev (melted in your mouth) and the Short Rib Beef Stroganoff (perfectly tender beef on top of delicious house made noodles). We ended our meal with the Spurgos (Lithuanian donuts) which were accompanied with magical house made Nutella. Great atmosphere and great prices. We'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"If you are looking for something different this is the place. My wife and I wanted to try something different and boy were we pleasantly surprised. The place has great atmosphere and the service was second to none. Our waiter Niko was amazing and really helped us order the perfect meal!!! We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Update:  we went back for brunch today, which was unbelievably good.  I had the duck crepes with havarti, mushrooms and sour cream, and my husband had the homemade pastrami with romescu sauce, potatoes, and sauerkraut.  He's a big fan of pastrami and corned beef hash and told me this one just went to the top of his list.  Previous dinner review: From reading the other reviews, I expected really great food and slow service.  The food was really great although not perfect (see below), and apparently the management has heard the issues with slow service and corrected them because our service was very prompt, even on a busy Saturday night.  All dishes were served in a coordinated fashion for both of us rather than serving each dish individually as it was finished in the kitchen.  We started with traditional rye Lithuanian bread and butter, which was very good.  My husband had the freshly made herring for an appetizer, and the filet mignon for his entree.  He first tasted the herring by itself and said it was salty, but when he ate it with the accompaniments he said it was very good.  He also liked the filet but said the accompanying potatoes were under-cooked and hard.  I started with the wedge salad, which was excellent but huge (see picture below).  It could have easily fed three people as a salad course, or one person as an entree.  I then had Chicken Kiev since it's one of my favorite dishes, and their version was possibly the best I've ever had (see pictures).  So why 4 stars instead of 5?  The undercooked potatoes and our seating situation.  Near the entrance there's a long low gold couch with two-person tables set along its length and regular dining chairs on the other side.  The couch is very deep so if you sit on that side there's no back support and you can't lean back.  It's good for your posture I guess, but it's nice to be able to lean back on occasion during a leisurely dinner.  Both were minor negatives.  We'll definitely go back and would recommend Sonata's."}
{"text":"Food was ok - but it took 25 minutes for a happy hour salad and fries with an egg. Then it took another 30 minutes for our 2 entrees. We live walking distance, but not sure we will be back. Also we were seated at a dirty table with dirty dishes. Great patio, but service needs to improve quickly."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and really enjoyed the food and service. I had borscht that is a beet soup with delicious little meatballs and my hubby had the cabbage soup and was a winner as well. Then we followed up with thin potato cakes crispy on the outside and soft inside really loved them. Added the smoked salmon which was a very good quality really buttery. Now we are closing this great meal with flourless chocolate cake . The service was excellent by Bradley. Even allowed us to pre taste some items before ordering.  Definitely be back for live music and food on Fridays"}
{"text":"I'm Russian and German so wanted to really love this Eastern European place! This is such a tough one! UGH! There were things I loved and so many I seriously disliked! I'm all about the food, and a lot about the service...so here we go....  Pros 1. Awesome food! Octopus appetizer to die for. So many levels and complexity of spices and flavor. Stuffed cod was amazing, too.  2. Beautiful atmosphere.  Cons 1. Majorly UNCOMFORTABLE seating. Get PILLOWS so your guests can be comfortable. The couches are about 2-3 feet away from the tables.... If you're short...forget about it. So not comfy.  2. SERVICE - Ugh! My husband ordered chicken kiev without mushrooms. We were very clear we didn't want mushrooms on the chicken kiev, but we wanted them on the side so I could eat them. Guess what? Mushrooms on the chicken kiev. Might not sound like a big deal...I made my hubby try them because it really shouldn't be that horrible. How can you not like mushrooms? Anyhow, hubby looked like he was going to throw up because he just despises mushrooms. At least he gave it a try, though. We sent it back.  I finished my entire meal and his re-done chicken kiev (without mushrooms) was still not done (30 minutes later). We had to leave to pickup our kids and couldn't wait any longer. Waiter got majorly bent out of shape with us when we said to box it up so we can take it home. Then he got REALLY annoyed when we asked him to remove the $17 from the bill and that we had a yelp coupon for 10% off. Seriously, who the hell wants to eat their dinner out of a doggie bag/container!? So, I had my yummy dinner. Hubby watched me eat...and got to eat his cold chicken kiev (which was not even that good - lacked flavor) at home out of the takeout container. Probably would have tasted better in the restaurant and if he didn't have to eat it 30 minutes later at home.   This really sucks because I would want to go back to try a few other things (really liked the octopus) but it will be almost impossible to convince the husband to try it again. Wahhh."}
{"text":"Disappointed at Easter. Made reservations for an hour before buffet closed. As we were being seated, told they are starting last call for it. When I went to the hot food area, no one was at the carving station. A manager was in the area and I heard him wonder aloud why chef left the post. I went for salad first thinking management would go to kitchen to get someone. Nope. When I went back, wait staff offered to cut the meat that was left there unattended. One went to the kitchen saying they will ask manager if someone is there. Management never came out to talk to me. No apologies or any. customer service. Wait staff was burdened with apologies and obviously embarrassed. They did well with serving. But you would think that when o we half the buffet is not available someone would offer a discount for not offering what is advertised."}
{"text":"We booked dinner reservations in advance on OpenTable for yesterday, March 17th, 2018 for 8:15 PM. We drove up from the East Valley to the restaurant relatively excited to try this restaurant for the first time. When we showed up apparently there was an event going on hosted by NicheBoom and the dinner reservation was invalid. I proceeded to go to the hostess to tell them that I never got notice and that this was unacceptable. The hostess got combative and said that there was no way I could have booked a reservation as they had blocked the ability to do so. I went to show her through the mobile app that indeed I had a standing valid reservation and she frankly did not care.  She tried to give out a standard coupon they were handing out at the event to come back for some free appetizer with purchase that was only valid during the weekdays.  Not even sure why she felt the need to try to fight about it when obviously she should have took the time to understand the situation and then figure out what the right way is to take care of a customer. After we left she had the audacity to then cancel the reservation at 8:25 PM to make it seem as if it was never valid which you will see below in the photos. Poor customer service, never even going to try to go back because of this, lost our business pretty quickly with that experience."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  Good service and atmosphere.  The food was nothing special, I ordered the  braised short rib plate. Really needs work.   Never coming back.  I hate to post negative reviews, but it is not up to par."}
{"text":"I love to cook, and I appreciate  good quality homemade cooking. Sonata's restaurant is a great example of taking favorite homemade cooking from scratch, and expertly creating scrumptious, mouthwatering and flavorful dishes served with exquisite style. I very much enjoyed the interesting serving platters from materials such as Slate as well.  I'm very surprised to have read some previous reviews on Yelp talking of a \"slow service\". The service at Sonata's is exquisite with very well-trained staff and management. The prepared fresh homemade food does take longer, so I certainly would take that into consideration. Our server was very attentive and professional, and helped us in making great recommendations.  Be sure to try this incredible place out if you have not already - you will come back for more!  Sincerely, Paul Sherman"}
{"text":"My dinner group totally enjoyed our dinner outing this past Saturday. Enjoyed my Crab Stuffed COD dish and everyone else had great praise for their dish. The service was great,  rate 10!! We strongly recommend this restaurant to all! Only negative was that some family had a birthday party for one year old on a Saturday night. Not really appropriate but not the Restaurant's fault."}
{"text":"We came here with a reservation at 7.30pm, now is 9.38pm and we are still sitting here waiting for our food. This must be something wrong happen at this restaurant. I don't even have my appetizer.  I'm expecting some explanation from management."}
{"text":"We are out of towners (Chicago) and came here based on a recommendation from a local bartender.  Our waiter, Brad, was polite, informative, and attentive.  We started with the \"inside out cheese sticks\" and I agree with the hype... it's one of the best things I've ever eaten!  We also had the bread platter and smoked honey butter. I took one star away because of this dish; the butter was overpowered by the smokiness.  It needed salt and a lot more honey. We had the Chicken Kiev and shirt rib for dinner.... wow!  Seriously so tender, perfectly cooked, and so comforting.  It truly is upscale Eastern European comfort food.  I only wish I could have ordered one of everything on the menu--so many things sounded tasty!  We will definitely recommend to all our friends/family.  Thanks, Brad!"}
{"text":"Friend made a reservation for 20+ people and they accommodated us greatly! We had a seating near the giant wall with wood in the back. Such wonderful service! Orders came out great, even gave us some complimentary shots.   I ended up sharing quite a few dishes with other people. The kepta duona was so wonderful. The sauce was great and was probably my favorite dish. Potato pancake with smoked salmon was good as well. The salmon was wonderful and fresh, but the potato pancake part was not the most appetizing. Perogies were great and flavorful, definitely a must order. It was my first time having snitzel and was not disappointed. Would say this is a hard dish to share though. The fries that came with it were also great.  Anyway, great place for large parties and food was wonderful. Would definitely recommend!  Note: If you check-in and your order is over $100, they will give you a 10% discount!"}
{"text":"Slow service, average food and big bright spotlights (turn the lights down, please!!) doesn't make for the best dining option for us. Gave it three stars because the staff's nice & friendly. Will try back in a few months & hopefully they will have figured out the lighting and tightened up in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I'm so upset. I ordered some take out and when I got to the restaurant the order wasn't ready. It took the restaurant 27 extra minutes to get my food ready. I should have gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place sets the standards for what a five stars restaurant should be. Going forward it will be increasingly difficult for me to give a five star to a restaurant.  Location: conveniently located with great access and dedicated parking.  We made a reservation and suggest making one as place can be busy.  Interior: great decor, proper lighting, excellent and elegant atmosphere Would recommend dressing up due to place being classy.  Weekend nights may have artistic performances  Cuisine mostly European but can find something for every taste. Had the pork skewers and beef stroganoff. Excellent dishes, perfect dish setup, right temperature, great taste.  Artistic performance: excellent, great program starting at 7pm with 50'60' blues   Prices: on high side but definitely worthy and balanced with what is offered   Overall score 5.0 out of 5. Excellent!!!!"}
{"text":"This looked like an interesting restaurant to try. My husband and I are visiting the Scottsdale area and have been to several upscale places since we have been here. I made a reservation and made them aware that we had a small service dog. We arrived on time with our dog, and were greeted warmly by the hostess. Many of the guests were making over our dog as well. I went directly to the ladies room and left our dog with my husband. Although the ladies room was beautifully decorated, it had a bad sewer smell. I tried to ignore it but there was definitely a problem. I had planned on mentioning it to the staff when I got back to the table, however my husband was waiting to tell me that we were not welcome with our dog, if she was going to stay in our lap. She is 8lbs, does not shed, and sits quietly in my lap or in a chair next to us. We are very hesitant to put her on the floor due to her size. We are afraid she will be stepped on. We chose to leave. Although the manager was nice according to my husband, we will obviously not be back. I hope they fix their sewage problem and possibly review their policies concerning service animals. As stated previously, we have eaten at MUCH nicer restaurants in Scottsdale with absolutely no problem."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and the one time we had dinner here the food and the service were both on point. Easter brunch on the other hand was very disappointing given the price. The oysters were sad looking and the prime rib just ok."}
{"text":"Interesting and tasty food.  OK wine list (with a gem or two) and better beer list (red Lithuanian on tap served in rustic ceramic mug with wood branch handle, anyone?).  Night club atmosphere (in a good way).  All in all, a nice addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place could build a business just around the soup.  We tried three. Borscht, sauerkraut (yes, a soup) and barley vegetable. Lithuanians run it. They know how to make the soups the old way. Hearty but not overbearing. Simply delicious.   Now to get the 5th star--service. Felt like people were either tripping over themselves or absent. Weird. Very nice in and out ambience so this place has what it takes if it crank up the professional level of service."}
{"text":"The kepta kuona were completely saturated with oil, while the potato pancakes were raw except for a delightfully delicious 1/4\" around their rims. We had planned to work through some of Dominic Armato's other favorites, but decided to save our calories for elsewhere.  Due to the disappointing food prep, stressed yet slow service, and sweet musical performer who might best avoid public performances, we wonder if they'll be able to pull it together."}
{"text":"We received a flier for this place last spring at the Polish Festival, and were anxious for them to open this fall.  We grabbed the Groupon and tried this place out for dinner.  We were instantly impressed with the decor and ambiance upon walking in.  They have an extensive drink list (I was glad to see some Polish beers - Okocim and Zywiec - along with some unique cocktails).  Their menu has some great offerings as well - we started off with the cabbage rolls and some soup.  My borsch soup was great - something you can't find just anywhere!  Cabbage rolls were flavorful too.  For my entree I ordered the pork shank, which was a great hearty portion presented very nicely.  My wife had pierogis, which were outstanding.  Tasty desert (can't remember the name...had bananas and chocolate in it and was somewhat like a milkshake) finished off an excellent meal.  Service, while very friendly and helpful, was a bit slow.  My wife and I agreed, though, that this is a place we'll return to."}
{"text":"We got into this place by accident. Best accident ever...  The place is on the upscale side a little and one does not expect this kind of food. The cabbage rolls are amazing,  pork shank is out of this world. We ordered the Napoleon  and boy this was a good one.  Very happy."}
{"text":"This is a nice slightly upscale restaurant.  This is a place where you can wear jeans or sport coat. The staff is really laid back but attentive. The salmon was tremendous.  You can sub out rice for asparagus. The portions were just right."}
{"text":"When I made my reservation for Saturday May 13 I knew the restaurant was having entertainment that evening.  I asked if there would be an upcharge for the show if we were having dinner and the person who was accepting the reservation put me on hold until they could check with their manager.  When he returned he told me there would be no additional charge.  About halfway through our dinner our waitress was rushing us through dinner and told us that if we wanted to stay for the show the upcharge would be $30 per person!  She said we could stay but she would have to move us to another table since this table was reserved.  What a mess.  Needless to say this ruined our evening.  Also, I am Polish and can tell you the food is very average.  The fish was not very appetizing, the Chicken Kiev was dry and overlooked and the beef was overly salty.  The best thing we had on the menu was the sauerkraut soup.  Probably not worth the trip as the owners don't seem to be engaged with their clientele.  They need to invest as much in improving service as they did in the decor"}
{"text":"Sonata's has amazing service but beyond that you have a menu that sets Arizona apart from the restaurants I have experienced in other states. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a something new and different. A must try, obviously!"}
{"text":"Where did this insanely amazing happy hour come from?! We've had a friend begging for us to come try out this new joint and we never built up enough motivation - honestly, it didn't look like our \"scene\". But, how wrong we were! First of all, the cocktails alone might have won me over. But the prices, the indoor decor, the bar tenders, the appetizers, the live music...there were so many great elements to make this a real winner. On top of that, they have a charging booth for your phones with wires for all the different brands AND they have soft blankets in case you dressed for 115 degree weather and are now freezing in the air conditioning. We ordered the steamed mussels and shishito pepper apps. I could have ordered 5 more. Highly recommend! They were out of oysters at the time but that's ok, I'll be back anyway. Huge shout-out to the 3 bartenders working at the time and their amazing mixology skills. Between my husband and I we tried out 6 different cocktails (perhaps we got carried away?), and they were all phenomenal. All we had to do was tell them something like \"I like vodka or whiskey drinks, not too sweet\" and voila, a perfect concoction appeared in front of you. I'm truly looking forward to my second visit here."}
{"text":"When we first came in at just before 7pm there was no one at the front and a couple of waiters who were trying to figure out something to do with wine did not greet us. A few minutes later the hostess came back to the station and took us to a table. Food was ok, lacking in seasoning (salt and pepper) In all three dishes we ordered. We got the chicken pate, beef perogies, and crab stuffed cod. Some of the drinks seem over priced. I got the prickly peach drink which was pretty good. Restaurant looks very nice, seems like they spent a lot on decor. The staff seemed like they didn't know what they were doing or what table to bring dishes to. They asked if we ordered the dishes when they brought them to us, and one of them they asked about was not a dish we ordered. The wait staff overall did not seem very warm in how they approached customers. The 20% off through yelp check in is very nice!"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere and décor set the mood for a lovely meal experience. Service was good and food was delicious. The happy hour menu was well though out and their menu had a lot of options. Next time we're the area, we'll definitely stop in, again!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous find! We were surprised at the transformation from the former restaurant into this beautiful and fun find. We stopped by on a Friday evening to find a combo playing and the restaurant pleasantly busy. They offer both inside and outside (large) dining and bar. We choose inside due to rain. We sat in the bar area at a high-top. The waiter greated us promptly and suggested several import beers, since this is a Lithuanin, German, Hungarian restaurant. They also offet a full bar. Since we were first time patron he explained the extensive menu and that they encourage sharing of plates. Once we spotted the Octopus salad we had to have it as an appitiser. It was delious, tender and moist, served with a nice salad. It was by far some of the best Octopus ever. I decided to try the Chicken Kiev. This was a childhood favorite that I had not seen on a menu in years. It was tender and moist, lightly breaded with a nice crust. Served on a bed of homemade whipped potatoes, with a fresh sauted vegatable. My partner had the homemade Gnoccni, which were also excellent. We definately shared everything, and, enjoyed every bite. We loved the food, atmosphere and the service, and cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"I am only giving this two stars because, for the most part, the food was good and i liked the decor of the restaurant. The service was lacking and extremely slow despite a largely empty restaurant. When we did get our food one diner had to have his food remade due to it being cold, while the rest of us enjoyed a lukewarm steak and fries. We were also almost shorted on both our wine orders (ordered quartino and got a glass) and my full size salad was reduced to a half size until I questioned the portion. I hate to give anyone a poor review, but this one was well deserved and no attempt at an apology was given between the wait time, portion issues and cold food. I came to this place based on good reviews and the (seemingly) large menu here on yelp, but the menu is about 25% of what is listed here. I would never recommend this place"}
{"text":"We had a really nice evening there with a group of six the other night.  We found this place by tracking down the bartender Will who recently departed one of our regular sushi joints.  We asked that he and the chef just make it happen and we didn't order a thing.  Call it a European omakase!  What an amazing evening!  The food and bev was so good that I completely forgot to take yelp pix  /shame.    Will behind the bar is worth seeking out and laid down a spread for the ladies and gents each with a customized touch.  His creativity is amazing and I think I had the best cocktail of my life which was the only photo I manged to take.  All I remember is it had Hudson rye in it and the flavors were layered and complex.  They also had a lot of interesting beers from Europe some of which I've never seen but all were tasty.    The lamb was as tender as it gets and we had an eggplant dish that made me say wow out loud with each bite.  The seating was very comfy and the place is well decorated, well lit and interesting.  Cool artwork throughout the place, some of which is modeled after the owner I understand.  It was beautiful and I suspect she might be as well :)  The live entertainment was good but perhaps not my style. It ranged from classical opera to familiar remakes and while always performed with talent it was just a bit of a juxtaposition for me at times with the rest of the restaurant vibe.    They have an amazing outdoor patio which will be very nice 17 years from now when summer is over intact with a nice outdoor bar.    We never saw a menu so I can't really comment on price but our evening was well worth the experience.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Really nice surprise during my short visit to  Phoenix. This restaurant is world class. Very interesting selection of eastern European beers. The Lithuanian porter was excellent. The herring plate was comparable or better than what I had in the Baltic states. And the seafood stew was five stars. Full of flavor and very interesting. The restaurant is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Caren gave great service!!!  and thank you for just suggestions, the food was phenomenal. Love this place and best thing it's in walking distance. Definitely will be back!!! Great selection of food and drinks."}
{"text":"Great food, beautiful ambience, and warm, personal service. I'm still drooling for more grilled octopus, and I'm not even an octopus fan! (Until now!)"}
{"text":"Service was friendly but, I felt short staffed. The food in general we just fine. The oxtail stew was more of an appetizer size not a main dish. The fish stew was okay but definitely needed flavor including salt. When I asked for salt server brought it out waited till I used it then took it away...darn it I forgot to salt my potatoes that I fished out of bowl lol. This was my 2nd time here. It's fine but, I have zero need to return. Nice atmosphere though and fun musicians."}
{"text":"We had a lovely Valentine's dinner here.  This restaurant is in Scottsdale, near Camelback mountain.  We chose outdoor seating, by the fire pit, which was cozy and warm.  Although the Valentine's Day menu was limited, the choices were perfectly selected and paired well together.  The venison was incredible, it tasted like fillet mignon.  My husband had the duck, which was also perfectly cooked.  Service was also good.  The only thing that could have been better was the live music, which was actually quite annoying and a reason for why we chose to sit outside."}
{"text":"We came in last night for dinner as it was our first time dining here and I must say everything was excellent.. I believe Scottsdale was in great need of a restaurant like this ... our server Hazar was extraordinary , he was very pleasant to be around and made our dining experience unforgettable !! We will definitely be back thanks Sonata\"s"}
{"text":"Will definitely be coming back to this beautiful restaurant. Gina was so good as our server ... very sweet and knowledgeable... food was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"If you just moved here from Europe and are used to waiting, and waiting, and waiting...and waiting to be served you might feel at home in Sonata's.  I kid you not, my guest and I waited over 45 minutes from the time we ordered until our food arrived at our table.  Were they busy?  NOPE!  There were only two other tables in the whole place - and it is large - that were occupied.  Was it an \"off time\" to be eating.  It was NOON so I guess the answer to that is also a NOPE!  Now for the food.  Was it worth the wait?  My guest had the stuffed cod which turned out to be an undersized (about 2 inches by 3 inches) piece of grilled fish with some stuff in it (supposedly sea food). I don't know what he expected for only $22.  I ordered the Schnitzel.  Being a full-blooded Saxon how could I resist.  I was envisioning the plate covering, and hanging over the edge of the plate, pan fried goodness of a piece of pounded out  to a thin patty of pork.  WRONG AGAIN!  I got a piece of pork about the size of the average beverage coaster which varied in thickness from about 3/4 of an inch in places to under 1/8 of an inch in most others.  It was served on a bed of some kind of shredded dark green uncooked vegetable matter, and it was topped with a fried sunny-side-up egg the edges of which were fried to crisp and the whites to rubber.   Now let's dig in to the fries which come as a side with the Schnitzel.  They were great!  No kidding they were great.  Hot, crisp, fresh, and ready to be dipped into the ramekin of catsup with which they are served.  The first fry actually broke when it hit the surface of the catsup. No kidding.  The catsup had a hardened layer on the top that the fry could not break through.  I am under the distinct impression that my  ramekin of catsup had been filled  well before I ordered this lunch, like maybe some time in January.  I guess for only 18 dollars, I shouldn't expect fresh with no surface-skin catsup with my lunch.  In case you are not aware by now, this place is on my NEVER EVER AGAIN NFW list of places to take a friend for lunch."}
{"text":"First appearance impression was a very enticing wow! Loved that the outdoor vibrant yellow patio couches and green leafy pillars caught my eyes during a much needed cloudy day for lunch. There was the bar for outdoors, high tables, low tables and ready for sports watching. Indoor dining was elaborately decorated as well.  Ready for the European flare I went for the roast duck crepe for $8 filled with havarti cheese, mushrooms, caramelized onions bundled in the crepe much like a burrito style. Grand marinee soufflé was pretty to the eye with the mixed berries on top. Middle of the soufflé was much hollow but yet tasty. Outer edge seemed a bit overdone. Allow 20 minutes for the soufflé to bake. Server was delightful.  Food service was a tad bit on the slower side for what seemed like not crowded timeframe. Overall presentation, taste, service and atmosphere was worth coming back. Bon appetite! :)"}
{"text":"I don't know where to start with my review due to every facet of my dining experience being top-notch.  The ambiance is modern chic with great live music; a menu that offers a variety of delicious appetizers, salads, entrees and award-winning desserts; the service provided by Gina was the perfect accompaniment to the culinary experience.  This restaurant has been open just over a year, and you are only cheating your tastebuds if you do not dine at Sonata's."}
{"text":"After eating here several months back and having a pretty bad experience we decided to try it again. The positives were , our food wasn't cold this time and we actually enjoyed it and stayed for their main course.  On the negative side the service is still very slow and the waiters aren't the friendliest  or most knowledgeable.  I suggest sitting at the bar and enjoying the appetizers."}
{"text":"We had the most amazing experience here: exquisite service from our server Hazar, artistic atmosphere with live music, and the food was phenomenal! This is a fabulous spot, and it felt like a hidden gem. I worked in fine dining for several years, and this operation has something amazing going for them; I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"We finally got around to trying this place and were not disappointed. We had a lovely late lunch and were able to take advantage of some of their happy hour specials. The food is European so different than the usual restaurant fare. Everything was very good and perfectly prepared. The decor is inviting and sophisticated. The sound track is swing Jazz at an appropriate sound level. We finished the meal with a Napolean. The flakey pastry and layers were perfect. This is a desert most places don't attempt. Our server was professional and very accommodating. I asked if it was possible to get a half glass of wine. She granted my request, and the charge was also half. We will go back again soon!   Update December 20, 2017  1 STAR! Poor customer service!  My husband and I have eaten here a few times and have ordered delivery, too. I have left a positive review in the past. However, last night I was extremely disappointed. I placed a delivery order on line with DoorDash at 6 pm and received a confirmation email saying delivery would be in 74 minutes. Someone from Sonata's called at 6:06 pm to say they no longer have the Napoleon dessert, and they were changing out request to chocolate cake. I said that was fine and hoped they would bring back the Napolean. At about 7 PM, I started to wonder how much longer our order would be. I had no calls or texts so checked email. An email from DoorDash had come at 6:09 pm saying the restaurant had canceled my order. I called Sonata's and was told that they have changed their menu and don't carry the same items that Door Dash lists. So, they just cancel orders. I found the person very dismissive and wondered why they hadn't told me this when they called about the dessert. We were very disappointed and will not waste time with them again."}
{"text":"Loved both the interior space and the terrace. Lots of nice seating outside where it is less noisy. Our waitress was both knowledgeable and enthusiastic. The live music, a classical guitarist, was nice background.   I asked for a Bombay Sapphire gin and tonic with extra lime. No extra lime. But my drink, served in an oversized old fashioned (wrong glassware for this drink) was drowned by about 15 ounces of tonic. Could barely taste the gin.   Of our foursome, three of us ordered the steak-frites prix fixe dinner which included butter lettuce salad with walnuts and a champagne vinaigrette. Each salad contained two small leaves of lettuce; the walnuts were about five crumbs, and there was NO vinaigrette!! We were all so astonished at the paltry servings that we laughed out loud! My husband ordered the same salad as a starter (for $10!!!) and his looked about the same. My steak was only tepid when it arrived. Are there no hot lights in the kitchen to keep our dinners hot? The large pat of herb butter on top never melted.   Dessert, the profiteroles, was delicious and well presented.   Will I return? No, I don't think so. Presentation and execution were not up to the price tag of the food."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have been here three times since discovering what an amazing place this is!  Sue me, but I've had the Chicken Kiev each time because it. was. that. good.   My fiancé is more adventurous and has tried something different each time and has never been disappointed!  Can't wait for our next visit back!  Maybe I will try something different... and maybe I won't."}
{"text":"EXCEPTIONAL! We finally tried a new place that we LOVE! We really didn't know what to expect from checking out the menu online, but we are elated that we decided to try it. Since I am a vegetarian I am always a little more nervous... especially a European restaurant with so much meat on the menu, but the perogies were amazing! My boyfriend had the beef stroganoff and said it was exceptional... trust me he is picky so that's a huge compliment. We look forward to returning very soon."}
{"text":"I have visited this place more than once for a few Birthdays because they can accommodate a big group. Also a few times with just a few friends . Every time someone at the table leaves disappointed. It's a shame because this restaurant is supposed to be a reflection of European culture.  Pros: Beautiful place . Food comes out looking very fancy.  Cons: the food takes over an hour to come out and when it does it's overcooked or burned or undercooked or just plain bland.   This place is supposed to be a flare on European food.  I personally know that Beet soup should have a nice chunk of meat and shouldn't taste like a block of salt.   My truffle fries came out looking soggy and took over an hour to come to the table.   The shishlic kebab with lamb only had two little pieces of lamb; the rest of the vegetables were burnt.  Also the lamb was very tough .   Sure I love the desserts but this came to disappoint me as well.  The donut fried balls were way too chewy on the inside and too greasy on the outside.    The dish it's called chicken Kiev is also very greasy.   It's a shame because being a European restaurant it needs to know where it's food is coming from and how it's cooked and maybe change up a few things in the kitchen.   I don't recommend anyone to go because food is way to expansive for what you get on your plate ."}
{"text":"They have Russian, Ukrainian,  Lithuanian,  and Polish food.  The interior and lighting was very beautiful. Our waiter was Nicholas and he was very attentive and patient. They had Belgian and Russian beers. I ordered the Chimay (white) for $10. They also have Lithuanian beers which come in a historic looking stone mug, very neat.  The Beef Stroganoff was $25 and extremely tender and savory. The Borscht was $10, and was smooth and delicious. The Creme Brulee was $9 and it was okay.  The waiter told us that on Friday nights they have live music from 7pm to 9pm, usually Russian or Latin. Saturday nights they have Blues also from 7pm to 9pm.  The service was above and beyond, definitely 5 stars, however, for the price the size portions seem on the smaller side."}
{"text":"I've been dreaming about the chocolate rum cake I had this afternoon all day.   My boss wanted to take us out for lunch today and I have been wanting to come here since they opened. Took me so long because my boyfriend wasn't sure about the menu but I reported to him today that he would be okay with it.   I had the potato crusted whole trout and it was exactly what I envisioned and more. Deboned completely with skin that was crisped so nicely. It was served on a stone tile which was different. For those that aren't used to eating fish with a head, I would recommend asking for it to be removed. My coworker was not fond of seeing the fish head and only imagined it looking at her. I didn't have a problem with it because I grew up eating whole fish, bone and all.   My coworker ordered the crabmeat stuffed cod and it was delicious (she gave me a few bites to try). Our boss had the beef short rib stroganoff - option for mashed potatoes or egg noodles. Our server managed to get him half mashed potatoes and half egg noodles because he wanted to try both. He said the short rib could have been more tender.  I can't quite remember our server's name but he was the only one running the floor. When I say he was running the floor, I really mean it because there was a little lunch rush for him. He managed it well with some help from the bartender and I believe the manager. Our server was very knowledgeable, mannered and conversational when  we first got there (because there was only one other table at that time). Once they build up a lunch crowd, I'm sure they will have more on staff but I understand why they had one server today.   For dessert, we shared the chocolate rum cake with chantilly cream. It was so good that I was sad I was sharing it. Even though I was so full, I couldn't stop taking bites of it. I'm actually glad our boss didn't want any part of it because it meant more for us. I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu - especially the desserts and maybe some of the martinis. Looking forward to coming here with my boyfriend to check out the scene on a Friday or Saturday for some live music and maybe some happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great eclectic menu, nice live entertainment, excellent service (thank you Hazar Sucuoglu), and so...full...of goodness. Can't wait to return with more friends."}
{"text":"Our dining experience at Sonata's was fantastic!  Everything we ordered was fresh and prepared to perfection.  More than the excellent food, the atmosphere is beautiful, the live music and voices of the singers was fantastic, and the service was impeccable.  Our server, Nicole, was extremely attentive.  She made us feel like we were her only patrons; and she ensured that our dining experience was memorable.  This was only the second time we had dined at Sonata's.  However, we look forward to dining there again very soon and many more times in the future."}
{"text":"Tried Sonata's for the first time last night. Beautiful restaurant with indoor and outdoor covered bar. Eclectic menu featuring eastern euro  items. Borscht  was served hot was great. Crab stuffed cod and pork shank were also great. Prices were very reasonable and our waiter Hazar was on the spot. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"First let me say the food is excellent. Both times we were there they had a singer with their own music. The first time we enjoyed the singer very much but the second time the singer was absolutely horrible and ruined our dinner. He was too loud and couldn't sing or carry a tune. We asked the wait staff to have him turn down the volume because it so loud and so bad it hurt our ears. After a while he turned it down but not enough for our liking and we couldn't wait to get out of there. I feel sorry for the staff that had to listen to it all night. Next time we go back we will ask who is singing so we don't have that same experience."}
{"text":"Amazing ambience, excellent service, and incredible food. If you are from Eastern Europe and/or appreciate food from back home, you owe it to yourself to come here. Ask for Gina - she's awesome!"}
{"text":"The food was so so good! We had appetizers, the main course, and dessert. All were phenomenal. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"What a find! Seafood salad, octopus and cabbage rolls were fabulous.   Cocktail selection is really good.   Nice change of pace.  Service can be a little slow and chaotic."}
{"text":"We just had the best meal that we ever had in Scottsdale or in this country.  We eat out several times a week and we travel  and dine all over the world.  When I say that we just had a great meal, I mean that we just had a great meal.  The service was a little slow to start with as we arrived at 420:PM, before they were ready for dinner.  I did get my Martini immediately which is important to me.  We did not come for  the service (which rapidly improved), we came for the food.  My wife ordered the Chicken Kiev and I ordered the house inspired Short Rib Beef Stroganoff.  Both were perfectly prepared; my wife scoffed her's down and I inhaled mine.  Fantastic.  Then our waiter suggested some strange sounding Lithuanian cheese curd desert with chocolate and cream and berries that was absolutely out of this world (the thing won first prize at the most recent Scottsdale Culinary Festival).  The best desert we have had in a long, long time.  We have now declared Sonata's to be our new favorite restaurant to go to for any occasion in town.  You have to give it a try.  P.S. A hardy Thank You to Brad, our waiter (ask for him)."}
{"text":"I love Sonatas. A wonderful addition to our neighborhood. The juice bar is quaint and the live music makes their environment AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is incredible. We ordered so many different things and every bite was delicious. Great beer selection too."}
{"text":"This restaurant has one of the most beautiful patios in the valley unfortunately the service is absolutely horrible. This was the second time my wife and I have dined here and both times we had terrible service. Three times we has to ask for lemon for our water. And why do they have a different server bring out our meals? This person doesn't know what we ordered, so they cant be sure the food they're bringing out is correct, which it wasn't. Big surprise.....NOT! our original server was an airhead. Oh and how can you serve decent pricey wines but only have one style wine glass? Really! White wine glasses only? Spend a few bucks and invest in the proper vessels to serve your red wines in.  And one more thing. If your going to list your restaurant on open table then do it the correct way. Don't have the app tell people bar seating only when your restaurant was half empty. So instead of booking online I called and the person who answered the phone said no outside seating tonight because of an event? There was no event, and they did allow us to sit on the patio when we arrived. NO rush to go back. Maybe to sit at the patio bar, but not to eat."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow, but we didn't care because we were enjoying the night here.  Hazard took over our table even though it wasn't assigned to him.  He was way cool, and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing food, venue, services and overall vibe. I kind of hope not too many people find this place so it won't have much of a wait when I go. Hahaha But that's selfish of me, I want this place to flourish.   Had the savory crepes and loved every bite! Everyone at my table loved their food also.   Oh, and best French fries I've ever had. Ever.   Live music was a real nice touch. Made me feel like I was at a real gem of a venue. :)   No wait on Sunday for brunch. Phenomenal food. Reasonable prices. A++"}
{"text":"Upscale dining experience, excellent from start to finish. Food, service, and ambiance are second to none. Interesting mix of Mediterranean flavors. Great happy hr specials and amazing staff. Make sure to say hi to Will at the bar. I really love this place. Sonata's restaurant is the best place for romantic dinner. I really liked the file mignon the best stake I ever tried."}
{"text":"The absolute worst dining experience I've ever had. Well over an hour for our food and then it was wrong. Horrible customer service. I wouldn't tell my worst enemy to go there."}
{"text":"Had a delicious dinner last night with friends! I ordered a G&T to drink and it was a delicious cocktail, the lavender ice cubes really made the drink. For dinner I had the scallops with cauliflower and sautéed spinach, it was seasoned perfectly and the scallops were tender. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place!! The service and staff are top notch and took care of every detail. The food is amazing and the drinks are the best I have ever had! I highly recommend this place! Thank you Will Power and staff for making my birthday celebration so memorable."}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant! Food and service is on point. Decor and ambiance is amazing. Creative cocktails, great happy hour! Highly recommend the venue for events as well. We just hosted one and attendees loved every aspect! Way to go Sonata's!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Ambiance, food, and service were all superb! The owner came by to explain the menu and chat for a bit. Live music was an added bonus. Chicken Kiev was to die for! Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Fabulously diverse menu, delicious food, and superb service.  Classy spot!  Can't wait to go back!  Party of 6 and we all loved our meals and the experience! C"}
{"text":"We came to try the lamb chops and the bottle of wine special.  We see on Facebook all the time and figured it was a time to try it.  This place is very clean and staff is very nice.  With a big outside bar with misters and comfortable sofa.  Inside is big spacious tables. Nice decor.  In my opinion people needs to come here and give this place a try. They won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great food, but I am taking a break from Sonata's for awhile.  The reason is service.  After three visits, it hasn't really improved.  My experience has been, all three times, that items come out of the kitchen in random, unpredictable order.  On two occasions, I wondered if my waiter left the building because our table hadn't been approached in forever.  I will add that in only one case - my first visit - was the restaurant crowded.  On the other two occasions, it was early.  The oddest thing is that I checked in on Yelp, the service sent the manager over, the manager approved and then the bill showed up without the promised discount.  I had to wait until the waiter came back, have him track down the manager, etc., etc.  This isn't why I'm taking a break but I thought it curious."}
{"text":"The reviews were scattered, but the food, service and ambience were all wonderful!Our waiter, Conor, was knowledgeable and attentive, with multiple helpful recommendations. We had the duck, fois gras... and ethnic donuts (spurgos varskes) for dessert. New manager has clearly ironed out the kinks. In short - we both loved it."}
{"text":"The food, the ambiance, and the service are all outstanding. The flavors are unlike anything else and so delicious. My favorite is the diver scallops, they are huge and its still a light flavorful dish. Call ahead to check the times for live music."}
{"text":"Amazing place,very nice interior...I tried chicken Kiev and can rate 5/5,kepta duona was delicious with pint of cold beer.My wife had pancakes with salmon and they were amazing.Very high quality service,helpful staff.We was there few times and brought our friends,they were impressed too.Highly recommend if you want to have a good food in nice ,cosy atmosphere.We definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Wow - we were so excited to try out Sonata's once we heard it was Lithuanian owned and the menu was influenced by this part of the world!  The decor is stunning (inside and out)...absolutely classy and elegant.  The service was incredible...James made us feel right at home and took great care of us.  We started our meal with a Lithuanian beer (hubby) and the prickly pear cocktail (me)...great way to kick off our dinner.  We then shared the ruskie pierogis and the cabbage rolls - so tasty and super filling too.  My husband ordered the beef stroganoff over the pappardelle (based on James' recommendation) and I ordered the pork shashlik - absolutely amazing as the pork was melt in your mouth tender and seasoned perfectly.  We will definitely be back and can't wait to try out even more menu items."}
{"text":"Sonata's is a unique spot in Scottsdale. Eclectic food from an amazing duck entrée to borscht. Make sure you are hungry. The cabbage rolls are excellent and the pork shank and sourkrout can not be missed. There was entertainment on the evening we went. The atmosphere is lively and this is a great spot for a special celebration."}
{"text":"Cannot rave about this place enough. Great atmosphere -- live music. Never felt compelled to do a review before, but definitely give this place a try. They actually care about their presentation and quality of food. Very much impressed. Cocktails are great as well! And of course, Hazar took great care of us!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner me and my wife a few days ago. I ordered the roasted dock, it was ok to me as I never ate ducks before. Our server was a handsome guy, I believe his name was Hazar, he made our experience fabulous, very nice gentleman, as my wife was having a bad day, he made her leave laughing all way to the car. I will definitely visit him again. Thank you Sonata."}
{"text":"Great and unique restaurant.  I wanted something different, and the valley just doesn't have many European restaurants!  The menu has many different items and I like the atmosphere.  The price is about right, though the meal would be a better value if it came with bread and salad.  I will definitely be returning.  I would've given Sonata's 5 stars easily if our server hadn't given us incorrect information about a menu item, and took down instructions incorrectly.  My mother wanted one ingredient omitted from her fish, and instead everything was omitted leaving her with a very bland fish.  The fish was also not prepared as the server had described.  Otherwise, everyone was very happy with their meals.  If my next visit is better, I will update this review to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Will is a true mixologist behind the bar.  If you don't see exactly what you want off an already interesting cocktail list (or like me, just can't decide), let him make you something off-menu.  Sonata's has a cool vibe and even cooler staff so give them a shot if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"External Ambience: 5 Internal Ambience: 2.5 (had a weird smell) waiters were wearing jeans but it was giving off a fancyish vibe with the live jazzish music, food prices and fancy plates food. Food 2.75: my wife liked her sea bass but within an hour she was feeling uneasy in her stomach.  She has a gluten allergy and was told there was no gluten in the dish. My lamb shank was I guess what a lamb shank is (a hunk of meet with nothing green like broccoli, beans or salad) so I didn't enjoy the dish, it was too 2 dimensional Service: 3.5 the kid needs training, and doesn't know the menu enough to make me feel confident.  Value: 2  the experience was lacking.  For the price I desire an experience and GREAT food, I got neither   Try at your own risk, maybe I ordered the wrong thing and the service was an off night? I won't be back."}
{"text":"Ordered pick up. The chicken was raw. We were able to pick up a replacement item for no charge. Got a nice apology from the manager and told there was a coupon in the bag. Then told to let them know if there was anything they could do before I could say anything the manager quickly walked away. It was disappointing. I am use to better customer from Scottsdale restaurants! Oh and the coupon is the same coupon they put in every Togo order."}
{"text":"This was our second time to Sonata's and once again we were impressed. It is a lovely atmospheric restaurant tucked behind California Pizza Kitchen in a strip mall.  This time we sat on the cozy outside patio with view of the open fire. The corner couch was cozy and made more comfortable with pillows and a soft fuzzy blanket. We enjoyed a craft cocktail first, the Pisco Sour was delicious! Our friendly and attentive server, Nichole, made sure our water glasses were never empty and timed our dining experience to our wishes. We leisurely sipped our cocktails as live music from inside drifted out to the patio.  The music on this visit was perfect, appropriate for the setting and nice background to conversation.  We had the sea bass and chicken kiev. Both dishes prepared were amazing. Perfect portions for each of us. A nice wine list is available. Both wines by the glass and bottles. Our meal was completed by the heavenly dessert, Spurgos. A small cast iron pot full of mini beignets accompanied by hazelnut chocolate , vanilla cream, and fresh berries. Definitely one of the best and most unique dining experiences we have had in Scottsdale!  Between the impeccable service (it is obvious this staff cares), the superb food, and ambience it really doesn't get much better."}
{"text":"I brought my Mother to Sonata's today for her birthday lunch. I called this morning to see if it was possible to order off the dinner menu as there were several things on the dinner menu we thought we might enjoy. We were told it would not be a problem. When we arrived at the restaurant we were given lunch menus so we requested dinner menus also. Our server, Chris, insisted that most dinner items were not available, I let him know I called earlier and the woman I spoke to earlier said it would be ok, he rudely asked me who I too. I couldn't recall. Needless to say it wasn't a great start to our experience.   We were never offered drinks, he simply poured us water. He never asked if my daughter or niece would like a drink. His attitude was extremely apparent through the whole experience and it completely ruined the beautiful atmosphere and wonderful food.   The only issue we had with the food was the pork shank was very bland, everything else was fantastic. Chris came back when we were half way through our meals and my mother told him the pork shank was tasteless. He explained to us how they have never had a complaint about the pork shank and he was surprised, however we were never given an apology about how we felt about the dish. Guess what, I could care less how everyone else feels about a dish. We weren't expecting a new dish or any kind of discount a simple acknowledgement would have been nice, maybe even a visit from a manager. When Chris came back to our table he made sure to let us know that protocol this kind of situation would be to let him know before we ate half the food that we were not happy. Had he come back to check on us we would have been happy to let him know.  I've been a server/bartender for over 15 years and I cannot even believe that he said this to us! I would be fired immediately if my manager heard me say this to one of my tables! The saddest part about this is that not at any point during our visit was there a table touch from a manager. I'm giving this place 3 stars for the food because it was outstanding! If I were rating it based on service I'd give it 0."}
{"text":"Menu looks great atmosphere is awesome music is great! Food is just soso!!!! Probably wont be back! 100 bucks and we will stop at in and out burger on the way home cuz we ate a few bites and didn't like it"}
{"text":"Some of the best service I've had! In Scottsdale for a business trip, and I decided to eat at Sonata's for dinner with a colleague. We were promptly greeted by some of the nicest people on Earth. The food was excellent, too! Highly recommended, I would absolutely dine here again."}
{"text":"A-Ok. I found the place a bit odd. The decor is weird. There is just so much going on that it seems like they held a contest for OCD interior designers. Nothing is wrong but for some reason when there is so much contrasting decor, it's a bit unsettling.   Our food was fine and so was our server. One thing that I did notice is that this restaurant is well set up for large parties and sure enough, there were a couple of them while we were dining."}
{"text":"Wow!  What an enjoyable experience.  We had planned to go elsewhere - but come on .. a 75 minute wait for some pancakes and eggs?  We \"yelped\" and found Sonata's had great reviews - called over, just a couple of blocks away - and no wait!  The coffee was fantastic - served with sugar cubes and a small marshmallow chocolate - yum!  I ordered the Croque Madame.  Much more food that I would have expected!  Egg cooked perfectly, the béchamel sauce, Gruyere cheese - sliced tomatoes - sour dough bread... was perfect.  Filled with a yummy shaved ham and I swear a country slice of bacon - but tis not on the menu - but I swear it was there.  I'm a big eater - and I was pleasantly filled.  We shared a crepe suzette.  Perfect!  My dining companions had various savory crepes and one had the breakfast sandwich - everyone was pleased.  Loved the presentation on slate plates. The fries.  OMG the FRIES!  I judge a restaurant by how they pull off one of the simplest of menu items.  These were crispy, hot, and served in their own little cauldron.  Even as they cooled off - they were incredibly good.  Fantastic.  A nice live music from inside could be heard out on the patio.  Sunday brunch doesn't get much better than this!  I hesitate to praise much - I'm afraid the crowds will find this little gem and we'll be standing in line.  But for now, this is my new favorite brunch spot Scottsdale.  Or Phoenix for that matter!  Bravo!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant, my fiancé and I have made this our go to place. Because of our busy schedules it's one of the only places that stays open late enough for us to enjoy dinner past nine in the evening. The chicken is my favorite, no matter how they prepare it, it always comes out amazingly perfect. Not only is the food great but this restaurant has some of the nicest, most experienced servers around. Hazar is my favorite server by far. Not only was he very informative but he was on top of everything. I too am I server and know what it takes to be one. Hazar is a wonderful server and a great new addition to Sonatas."}
{"text":"I have been a couple of times and each time has been excellent. I booked a reservation on Yelp prior to my anniversary and these guys took care of everything. We had a great table that was not to close to the live music. They have a very unique menu and a great beer, wine, and cocktail selection. Service has always been perfect and we have walked away both times, satisfied with the overall experience. We look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came to Sonata's after a long drive from LA and were extremely excited to try out the selection after reading the good reviews. After last night, I'd say that the food is great, the service sorely lacking. 2.5 stars, rounding up because the food came out quickly.  We waited twenty minutes after being seated before flagging down a waiter to get water poured for us. The waiter who served us was relatively new and mentioned that we weren't his table, so we cut him some slack and were pleased with his service. However, the server we suspected was supposed to be in charge of our table - a slim brunette man with a beard- only came by our table to apologize for not having served us earlier before never coming back to our table again. We presume that he was too busy taking care of the bigger party behind us in the hopes of getting bigger tips.  However, in a restaurant that was not even full-house and with several members of wait staff idly standing by, I hope to see consistency in service improve because the food truly was delicious. We got the filet mignon, ruskie pierogies, borscht, mushroom and barley stew, and the funeral potatoes. Great presentation and quality food."}
{"text":"Totally underwhelming. Our waitress forgot items from our orders two different times. I had to remind her both times to bring the items to us. Turns out one of the items they ran out of.... maybe she was hoping we'd forget. The salad was so gross. I kept biting into bitter pieces of lettuce and there was a whole garlic bulb. Who puts a whole garlic bulb in a salad?! $150 later and we are running to McDonald's because she forgot items and I was stuck eating a lamb shank by itself. Good wine though."}
{"text":"An incredible experience!   The flavor in my filet mignon was melt-in-your-mouth & so savory.  The ambiance was relaxing & delightful. Live music that set the mood, beautiful interior design & great service! They really did not hold back on anything. Everything was a pleasure. You won't be disappointed. I really enjoyed Sonatas and plan to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere , knowledgeable bartender , great happy hour. Need to get back for dinner , menu looked great"}
{"text":"Went there tonight and had some of the worst service I've had in a long time.   Server asked if we wanted the plates cleared and after telling him yes, we're done, he walked away and left them there.   Didn't take out entree order until after we completely finished our appetizers so our meal took forever. We didn't even consider a dessert because we didn't want to wait another 30 minutes if it was anything like the pace of the service for the night.   If was obvious the server went outside and smoked during service as he came in spelling like an ash tray and made us lose our appetite, and probably explains why he was never around.  My lamb was very under cooked which is an easy solution if he had checked in on how the meal was but didn't until we finished, and not to mention the manager didn't touch the table once during the 2+ hours we were there, so I ate the under cooked meal.  The food was decent at best, but will not be returning. This place needs serious help from food to service to management. Coming from 10+ years in serving and managing restaurants you can only blame the management for lack of training and presence on the floor.   The one good thing was it was a nice looking venue and seemingly clean."}
{"text":"I have been there a couple of times. The first time the food was great and service was excellent. But food and service were just OK the second time when they had more customers. It took sometime for the drinks to come and the food came lukewarm. I may want to give them one more try when the busy season is over."}
{"text":"Spectacular happy hour and beautiful patio and restaurant. A truly unique Menu and wonderful staff. Rare that you find such a different style of food in Scottsdale. Will be going back often."}
{"text":"I don't know what took me so long to try this place out. It was a very unexpected, amazing experience. I highly recommend the Kepta Duona and the Short Rib. This one of my new favorite restaurants in the valley"}
{"text":"Went there last Saturday night to celebrate a friend's birthday - we did not have reservations - and the restaurant was very accommodating and we were very lucky and they were able to seat us. It was a packed house! It apparently caters to a very \"mature\" audience; there was live music which was very loud and hard to hear over, but when your restaurant is full of octogenarians it kinda has to be that way.   The interior and exterior of the restaurant is very lovely. I think it would be really nice to sit out on the patio for dinner in the nicer months. The lighting is a bit dim and food is served on dark (slate grey) plates - it can make seeing your entree a challenge.  Our server was very sweet, but she seemed out of sorts and rushed. The order pad she was working on was glitchy and that seem to add to her stress. She had the table next to us, and one of their side dishes was missed when the entrees were served; so they cancelled that portion of the order. We got a bit worried at that point....  Our first course was delivered before the drink order made it to the table and even then we had to remind her it still was not here. For our main course, we ordered the stroganoff - it definitely did not live up to all the hype here on Yelp. The spare rib was overly fatty - some marbling is nice, but when 50% of the entree is inedible, that isn't good; the noodles looked like they had sat for a while before being plated; and one of the plates had no sauce at all leading to a very dry dish overall. The meat to pasta ratio was abysmal - maybe four noodles to a huge piece of meat.   I don't know if this was an off-night or this is just how things are when the restaurant is busy. They seemed understaffed, unprepared for the busy night, and served underwhelming food. I'm not going to give them a second chance (I regret the first chance) and that is unfortunate because their menu seems so lovely.   If you are going to try this restaurant, here are my suggestions avoid the weekend. Make reservations. Try something other than the beef stroganoff. I hope you have a better experience."}
{"text":"We loved everything about this place. Wonderful staff, diverse menu, good cocktails and aesthetically beautiful. Well done team Sonata"}
{"text":"My wife made reservations at Sonata's for Valentine's Day and it didn't disappoint.  It was our first time at this Eastern European restaurant.  My wife had the Artisan salad and I had the Borscht soup for our appetizers.  Besides being fresh and \"clean\", I was happy that our food wasn't over salted.  My main course was the chicken Kiev and my wife had the beef short rib stroganoff.  Both were excellent.  The accompaniments were mashed potatoes and a mushroom ragout.  They were fantastic.  I highly recommend giving this restaurant a try.  Ask for Gina, she provided great service.  Final note:  everything was marked Gluten Free where applicable and there were many choices."}
{"text":"Service was slow. I felt so old here...live music was a disaster. Food ok but the rest of it is saggy and just plain sad."}
{"text":"I came in few weeks ago sat at the bar had great cocktails and the kepta Duana it was all delicious and had the best service from a special man Hazar !!! Thank you guys"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a drink ... ordered duck, so amazing and the bartenders are nice to look at too"}
{"text":"Truly a delightful dining experience!  We sat outside on the terrace and explored the unique menu of Lithuanian/Eastern European food.  We started with the Borscht to share & get our taste buds tantalized, it was fabulous!  (Beet soup with melt in your mouth meatballs) We then ordered the Roasted Half Duck with Celery Root Puree, Caramelized Potatoes & Elder Berry Sauce with Sauerkraut (WOW!), the  BBQ Glazed Salmon on Dill Smashed Red Potatoes with Sauteed Wild Spinach & Roasted Yellow Creamed Corn (WOW!), and the Chicken Kiev with Borsin Mash, Charcuterie Sauce and Wild Mushrooms (WOW!) and every morsel was excellent.  Hazar was so helpful, polite and kind...our entire experience from the ambiance to the food, beverages and service was perfect!  Well done!!"}
{"text":"I was able to try out the brand new brunch menu today at Sonatas in Scottsdale!  Looking at their brunch menu, it was hard to pick just one items so we got FOUR! Everything sounded  so amazing.   1) blueberry pancakes with blueberry whip! Divine! The pancakes weren't too sweet which I loved and the whip was light and delicious.  2) the Paris Crepe. This was one their savory crepes and let me just say this is my absolute most favorite thing we ordered. Inside was ham, bacon, gruyère cheese and topped with a poached egg and béchamel sauce. Yum! If I could have, I would have licked the plate.  3) the Paul's Crepe. I have a love for Nutella so of course I had to order this one. Inside was bananas, strawberries and Nutella. Simple yet bursting with flavor.  4) the wood grilled burger. This one had me at \"ground brisket\", bacon and cheddar. This thing was packed with flavors that blended so well together. The meat was so juicy which dropped down my arm but I didn't care, I was enjoying this like it was my last meal. This came with seasoned fries which were crisp and seasoned to perfection.   I enjoyed all of this with a mimosa which had just enough sweet and the orange tasted like it was just picked off the tree and squeezed. So fresh and light!   I really enjoyed the atmosphere, it felt very welcoming and warm with a modern flare. The staff were all super polite and made sure all of our needs were exceeded. A+"}
{"text":"This place is a nice new hot spot in Scottsdale. The decor is very elegant & classy. Our waiter Sal greeted us right away, after being seated by the hostess. He promptly took our drink orders & gave us some great recommendations for shared plates. We sat outside on the patio because it was a beautiful day. The heat lamps were on low which made it the perfect temp. I ordered the Crepese Salad as a starter. My friends ordered a burger & the ham & cheese sandwich with egg. I had bites of all & they were tasty. Sal was always there when needed for drink refills & clearing our table. They also have a great Bloody Mary bar! The best thing about it is, you don't have to make it, all you do is pick out all the ingredients. When checking in on Yelp there you receive a 20% discount up to the first $100. They honored it with no issues. I will definitely be a return customer, as well as my friends. Thank you Sal for a great experience at Sonatas."}
{"text":"So after my initial experience, a partner of the restaurant and marketer reached out to me appalled by my experience. They went out of their way to speak with their staff and welcome me back to make up for my bag experience. Service was great, the food was delicious ), and Im touched that they went out of their way to make my experience 100 times better.  I'm glad I came with a couple of my gfs because they had a great time and will return. Btw, their French toast is to die for!!! I've been dreaming about it for days since I had it.  Everything on the brunch menu looked and tasted delicious.  Thank you all so much!!"}
{"text":"I just had to make an addition to my post, especially after having read others who had bad experiences at other restaurants for special birthday celebrations.... ours was fantastic!   When we came in I reminded our waiter that this was my friends very special birthday celebration and he surprised us with her very own dessert, including a sweet candle  .... Thank goodness, much to our great pleasure, no songs were sung :-)"}
{"text":"If you like school cafeteria food this is it. However, eating with your children at school would be a lot cheaper. The Fathers Day \"brunch\" was NOT good, we could have had a better breakfast at McDonald's or Waffle House. We were very disappointed because we have been in for dinner and the food was wonderful. Everything today was not what we were expecting."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant with great service and excellent food. We had been looking at it for months but couldn't quite figure it out.  Well, it will now be one of our go-to restaurants.  Loved loved everything about it!!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the presentation was nice but the food only OK. I thought the price was high for the quality of the food. The place was not even crowded and it took a long time to get drinks and dinner."}
{"text":"Great Patio! Great Service! Galina was our waitress and she spent a lot of time at our table helping us pick our dishes! We will be back! Love the drink menu... very deep selection!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went on a Wednesday night. Excellent service, great cocktail menu and rockefeller oysters are to die for, must try!"}
{"text":"We are regular guests. We enjoy the food immensely. But we have been unhappy on the last 2 visits. Service has gotten worse. The kitchen has gotten slower than slow. The servers never mention specials. They always seem new. But the worst offense is no real manager at dinner.no one walking around making sure all is ok. The owner used to do it. You need someone in authority there. Do something please before you screw this good thing up. One More Chance!!"}
{"text":"Good but very expensive.  Four perogies is not enough to share as was claimed.  Food was good but there are other more authentic places that are just as good.  Had the borscht, oxtail stew and the ruskie perogies.  Never able to get a refill on my Diet Coke.  Atmosphere was great, but loud."}
{"text":"Fabulous  restaurant,  great food, great people.  A must in Scottsdale. Marley Taylor  singing, great music, fun"}
{"text":"Off beat food.....duck liver, potato pancakes, sauerkraut soup...etc.  But my main complaint was that in a party of 6, one received food, then when she was almost finished, the second dish arrived, and later still the last 3 received food.  I think that's rude...and shouldn't be done.  As we were leaving, the manager asked how we enjoyed our meal.  I told him.   (Not happy) and his answer was, \"I understand\"."}
{"text":"The Easter Brunch was fantastic!  Great food, wonderful ambiance and attentive service.  The seafood was fresh and the meat at the carving station, tender and juicy.  Our waiter, Brad was very good and look forward to having him serve us again in the future.  This definitely a restaurant to come back to."}
{"text":"This was ok , not great but salad really good , my ribs tender. but the beef stew was disappointing."}
{"text":"Sonata needs some help. This new restaurant has an interesting menu and attractive dining areas. The food is very good but the management and service need help. First, we ordered three appetizers to sample the food. My wife's Borsch came out 10 minutes before my stuffed cabbage rolls. Both were delicious but we don't like eating separately. Our third appetizer did not come until the entries.   Our server never filled a water glass, was friendly but clearly had too many tables to help. Even though we clearly had timing problems the manager never visited the table. My half duck was excellent and my wife loved the crab stuffed fish dish once it arrived.   Hopefully the problems with the service will be resolved because the Eastern European style place is a welcome addition to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The food and service is amazing!!!!  I would definitely go back any time.  The only reason I am giving 4 stars is we were there with my husbands boss and the live band was so loud we could not hear a word anybody on the table was saying."}
{"text":"Sonata's is one of the best restaurants in Arizona.  The owners have successfully assembled every aspect of restaurant dining in perfect juxtaposition, and it is an absolutely first-rate dining experience.  The ambiance, the seating comfort, the food quality and presentation, the enjoyable live music - it's all there.  Sonata's is not only at the top of the heap in Arizona, it would successfully compete alongside the best of New York and Chicago.  In fact, I wish we had something this terrific in Chicago.  Chicago does have a somewhat similar restaurant, Bohemian House, which also presents a number of delicious Eastern European dishes.  It earns 4 1/2  Yelp stars, and it's very good, but I think Sonata's is better.  Sonata's kitchen staff must have an artist on staff, as each dish is beautifully presented, with the food often arranged vertically like an attractive sculpture, and on dishes that might be a flat piece of granite or other interesting plate.  The comfort of being in Sonata's extends to the leather armchairs and upholstered couches, the appropriate live music, and the friendly and helpful staff, including the owners who are often present.   And I've saved the best for last - the food.  I could make a meal out of the amazing appetizers.  You MUST order the kepta duona, crispy rye bread tossed in duck fat aioli and Havarti cheese.  It is addictive, and not nearly as heavy as its description sounds.  The borscht is beautifully flavorful and silky smooth.  The pate pops with a fresh and tasty liver flavor.  I think I've tried most of the mains, and there's not a weak one in the bunch.  The duck is juicy and flavorful with a perfectly crisp skin, the smoked short rib stroganoff over pappardelle egg noodles is tender and juicy, actually aromatic on presentation so as to preview the wonderful flavors you're about to enjoy.  I was lucky enough to score a place on New Year's Eve when one of the dishes served on the set menu was Chilean sea bass, possibly one of the best versions of that great dish that I've ever had.  I would encourage ownership to think about including Chilean sea bass on the regular menu.  A friend of mine who loves chicken Kiev and tries it anywhere it's on the menu pronounces this chicken Kiev the best he's ever tasted.  Not on the menu but almost always available is caviar, both red and black.  You must request it.  A very generous portion of the red caviar is $30, and believe me, it is a bargain.  I strongly recommend this terrific restaurant.  It is unique and wonderful.  It is an experience, and the prices are crazy reasonable for the quality of what you are served.  Thankfully, this very new restaurant is finally catching on, and it is now occasionally becoming difficult to score a weekend reservation.  Try it.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Resturaunt! The ambiance and food is number one! Finally a Resturaunt that is not noisy! I enjoyed every minute here from the nice owner to the attending waiter! Thanks for coming to Scottsdale!!!! The food is artistically present with perfect flavoring!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! Comfortable and lovely setting.  Our only complaint was the speaker check that happened while we were looking over the menu. The music was already loud (we were sitting very close to the speaker so no surprise), but the sound check was ear splitting for the brief time they were doing it. That being said, we never thought to ask them to turn down the music because the service was so friendly and the food came so quickly and was so delicious that we were totally absorbed by the experience. Considering their attentiveness and attention to detail, they probably would have gladly turned down the music if we'd asked. Will definitely return the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at Sonata's Restaurant celebrating my birthday. Beautiful interior, friendly service, delicious food with great presentation. My family and friends loved the live music and friendly service. Definitely coming back to Sonata's."}
{"text":"We went there yesterday for dinner - the food was great (filet mignon was probably one of the best I've had), the staff was wonderful and professional.   Sonata's restaurant exceeded my expectations, therefore, I definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a delicious and reasonably priced meal & drinks in an elated atmosphere."}
{"text":"The new best restaurant we found!!!! Number one is pork shashlik then Kiev chicken melting in your mouth:) David came to our table with big respect and gave us complimentary cherry homemade vodka was delisious!!! I recommend everyone right now to go and try this amazing beautiful restaurant with their unbelievable menu and friendly service!!!"}
{"text":"Promised myself to give this place one more try after a note from the business owner assuring me the vibe would be better on our next visit. Things seemed promising when we we walked in- they have upped their music game and there was a good crowd for a Friday night. The bar staff, as friendly as last time, welcomed us back. But things went seriously downhill from there.   I have no idea what was going on in the kitchen, but it was not good....  - The restaurant week version of the kepta duona was two small slices- would have been fine except that by the time it arrived, we had been waiting over an hour for our food.  - 30 minutes later our first course arrived- octopus that was cooked well, but overpowered by the flavor of the fennel and served room temp, not hot. - After another long wait (during which the bartender kept apologizing and offering drinks) the scallops arrived. Again, cooked well, but cold. - The extra side of cauliflower that we ordered on the side was depressing looking. - Instead of dessert, we received more apologies. Apparently they ran out- on the first night of restaurant week? Oh boy.   The ridiculous delays were puzzling. The place was busy, but not THAT busy and it looked like there were plenty of staff who kept huddling together for intense meetings near the kitchen. I have to give credit to the bartender who was very apologetic and tried to keep the night from turning into a downer for everyone seated around us- the couple who waited 45 min for cold cabbage rolls, the guy whose \"sandwich\" was a major miss. He kindly comped the bill for us and promised things will be better on the next visit. There is definitely potential at this place with some really good dishes, but I don't see us returning again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Just had Sunday brunch this morning.  Interesting brunch selections with reasonable prices.We tried the omelet of the day....pork belly, sauerkraut and gruyere cheese!  Also shared the groud chicken sandwich and the roast duck crepe.   Nice, upscale atmosphere, and they had a live music for Sunday lunch!  We'll be back to try the dinner menu!  Eastern European inspired dishes, but with some interesting twists."}
{"text":"When we came in I said to the hostess \"let's see if you can meet all the hype about this place.\"  I'm here to tell you they did!  Started with the potato pancakes. Made with mashed potatoes instead of the grated I grew up with. Perfect crispy edges. Wonderful flavor. We asked for the duck on the side since my wife is a vegetarian. Lucky for me she is. The duck was scrumptious. Sweet. Perfect. Next up was the ruskie pierogis. Mashed potatoes and cheese filling with mushrooms and a light sauce on top. Not what I grew up with. But we ordered a second order!!  The stroganoff over papperdelle noodles was perfect. The sauerkraut was juicy and full of flavor. All in all we had 5 clean plates!!!   Let's call this a 5 of 5 stars. Thank you!"}
{"text":"UPDATE! Under new management (Lovely, gracious new GM) this hot spot has really hit its stride. I liked this place before, now... I LOVE it. Seems they have sorted out their growing pains and held on to their key staff(Mixologist BabeRaham Lincoln)  an undisputed asset behind that beautifully back-lit bar) The vibe is very 'Chic Saturday Date Night' . It's sexy and fun and the service is impeccable. We walked out on a bad movie and landed here, to our delight, it seemed as though they were expecting us. Gorgeous cocktails promptly delivered and a few well-appointed bites, Foie Gras  and their signature ; kepta duona. (Duck fat crispy rye bread , bathed in Havarti cheese. Everyone there seemed to be having the sort of fun you'd hope for on a Saturday night. The chocolate cake dessert was fantastic! Thank you! The staff is to be commended for making this a cleverly unique, perfectly located, cozy- trendy place we are proud to have in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The International Supper Club UYE is kicking off the new 2018 year with our 1st restaurant and Sonata's was the place we picked! It's a beautiful restaurant in North Scottsdale.  I was able to make our reservations via Open Table (which I love, if you haven't tried you should! Makes making reservations easy peasy!)   After checking out the menu, I knew I was indulging. I went with the braised short rib and fingerling potatoes.  The braised short rib was with valdeon blue cheese tagliatelle pasta, pearl onions, toasted almonds and natural jus. The short was tender and juicy and went well with the pasta, and I really liked the pearl onions, you don't see them that often. This was a great tasting dish! The fingerling potatoes came with onions and bacon as well and were a perfect companion to the short rib!  Dessert had been calling my name before I even walked in there, and I knew I had to have the grand marnier and lavender cream brulee! It was divine! The crack of the sugar top was perfect each time, and the creamy custard was delish! So yummy!  This was a great place to kick off the 2018 International Supper Club UYE!"}
{"text":"Sonata's is a very well put together. It is so cute inside and very comfortable with a splash of glam. Will, our bartender is an amazing bartender. He has such a talent in making delicious drinks. He also makes such a show when he makes them. He is a great bartender and has excellent customer service. Very nice place to come and relax."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.Discovered it today and had a great experience. The kitchen was very accommodating of allergies and preferences, the presentation was photo-worthy, and the staff is great. We had Conor as our server and he took excellent care of us! Thanks for a great brunch!"}
{"text":"You have to try this place. I've been two times for dinner now and can't wait to go back. I had the Chicken Kiev and the Roasted Duck. Both were excellent and I would order again in a heartbeat. The restaurant is beautiful and very spacious inside. There is a massive outdoor patio area that is closed right now (summer), but it looks like it will be the perfect spot to enjoy the nicer weather when it arrives. The service was top notch. The servers were prompt, friendly and very attentive. The bar has plenty of seating and the craft cocktail menu is very cool. I ordered the smoky old fashion which was served with a spherical ice cube topped with a cork screw ball to keep the actual smoke in! Very cool presentation! There is so much to like about this place, but first and foremost, the food is fantastic. Everything else is a bonus."}
{"text":"We were so excited to finally try this restaurant  but the poor service, cold appetizer and wine list let us down greatly.  When I asked our waiter  what kind of caviar they had as we were considering adding it onto a meal, he said he wasn't sure it was black , small and round. ( Insert Shocked look) . We found it very odd that they were asking $90 for the  caviar , yet he couldn't even tell us what kind it was and didn't bother to ask the kitchen either. Needless to say we didn't get the caviar and we truely wanted it.  The highlights of the evening were the octopus appetizer and an appetizer with rye bread toasted and drizzled in a duck fat sauce. The resturant itself is absolutely beautiful  and the menu looked wonderful. We had intended on eating dinner after several appetizers but chose to have dinner and spend another $200 elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food is okay. I have been there twice.  Service is good. But I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in Scottsdale!!! From gorgeous design of the restaurant to an amazing food. The New Years celebration was planned to perfection- live music, dj later, 6 course impeccable menu and super friendly and professional staff. This place makes you feel very welcomed and special. Recommend to all who haven't been. Thank you Sonata for being such a good host!"}
{"text":"Great dinner and excellent service. Thank You Conor. This place has a 1st class menu and a great bar. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The restaurant and patio are beautiful and I highly recommend dining at the patio during nice weather. I came here to celebrate my birthday and I ordered the wild mushroom pierogies, the cherry wood smoked duck and the mini beignets. The pierogies were good but I didn't care for the wild mushroom sauce on the side of the plate. The duck was my favorite! It was delicious! The beignets were ok. I wouldn't order again. Overall, it was the perfect atmosphere to celebrate my birthday with great food!"}
{"text":"Beautiful and full of life! The textures and lighting of the interior are luxurious and modern. I love when the walls speak. There is art on the walls and a mural in the bathroom nothing overly done just perfect. The food is Lithuanian and European in concept but a few hints of other worldly flavors can be found.  Kevin. Kevin the bartender is a mixologist master! Having first tried his drinks while staying at the Camby, we literally cheered to see his face behind the bar here at Sonata's!  The food was better than delicious and the prices were reflective of that. We forgot to use our Yelp checkin coupon but that's okay, it justifies a return to this gorgeous restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is quickly becoming my new favorite restaurant. I love that it's something different than the classic Italian food. Even with lots of different European influences like Lithuanian, French, and Russian, there's something on the menu for everyone. My favorite is the chicken kiev. I've been here 3 times and the food is always delicious, the service is always friendly, great ambience, and I was surprised at how moderately priced the food is for this kind of place. My family and I love it here and we will be going back!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was top notch. I wouldn't expect anything less though.....  I recommend what is pictured (pan seared sea bass, Braised Short Rib, old fashioned, and warm chocolate cake). You order that for the evening, and you will definitely be happy with your choices."}
{"text":"The food is still great, as well as the service 9/10 times. Recently they seem to have raised the price on a couple of items, which I was almost expecting. The owners, managers, and most of the staff are extremely pleasant to interact with. A couple of months ago we had a server who was soliciting us for good reviews (specifically of himself) on yelp, ironically, that is why I have removed a star. We did not appreciate being begged for a good yelp review by Hazar, who asked us to mention him by name. I'm not sure this is the context in which he was hoping. His insistence was incessant, even after informing him we have already given the restaurant a 5 star review. I understand there is a learning curve to any job and he surely wants the praise of his boss, however this is a modern European eatery, not a used car dealership. It's chicken Kiev and octopus--if you want to talk then tell me about the food, where it comes from, how it's special. Excellent food and exceptional service gets good reviews. I still love this place, but the solicitation by our server on that visit was unsavory. Every other server we have had was gracious, speedy, and respectful. I hope the owners are not asking their servers to engage in this solicitous behavior, because the food and service speaks for itself and they should have no problem getting 5-star reviews without asking. We will continue to go here, and most likely add back the star I have removed in the future."}
{"text":"I couldn't be more happy with my experience last night. Went out for date night and we were blown away. The service was attentive and on point. The ambiance was romantic and soothing with a live singer. Our food was so delicious! Recommend the pierogies! We will be back ASAP- as we want everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great dinner before a concert. The atmosphere was     Very nice and was able to carry on a conversation without having to shout. Our waiter, Brad, was very knowledgeable and attentive. The rustic pierogis were better than any restaurant pierogis I've had except Kraków Poland. The short rib stroganoff was tender and succulent. The only disappointment was the menu said smoked honey butter with rye bread but they were out of the smoked butter. It would have more helpful if the waiter had informed us of that. He didn't know at the time.  Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"I recently attended an event at this fine restaurant.  The meal was excellent from start to finish.  The salad was excellant and beautiful .  We had the opportunity to sample four appetizers.  The meat and cheese, the foie gras, the potato pancakes and duck, and salmon.  Each was unique and tasty.  The entree was strogenoff with fresh noodles, which was delectable--thebraised short rib meltef in your mouth.  I would like to try it with potato next time.  And the neopolian cakes was supurb.  The service provided by Hazar and Nicole was far beyond expectations, adding to the fabulous experience.  I recommend this restaurant for a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"The ambience is great and the food is amazing. The rye bread in duck fat dish is really good. Hazar was our server and he's awesome! Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Drinks are creative and delicious. The food is also creative and very tasty.  Went with friends and between us we had the potato pancakes with duck, cabbage rolls for appetizers. Apple salad, caprese salad and for dinner duck and the beef stroganoff. Everything was fantastic."}
{"text":"Fantastic menu! Great ambience.  Fun interesting and different! Very refreshing. The outside dining is well done."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Tried a few dishes, including the potato perogies. Service was poor (very slow, no drink refills, esp given the fact anybody was there...)  The decor is good. Suggestion? Move right along."}
{"text":"Beautiful romantic setting and beautiful modern decor, delicious food and an excellent service.  The pierogi and borsch soup are to die for, yummy!  We sat outside in the patio, it was so beautiful and the smell of the jasmine flowers was so beautiful.  You get %10 off by check in here and about %5 cash back, what a deal!  Thank you Sonata!"}
{"text":"Agree with Lea -- service when we were there was really bad -- long waits -- was really looking forward to our first visit but was disappointed. Outside venue lovely -- inside very loud due to wedding party that consumed the dining room. Glad that a others have had a better experience."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for Sonata's on Open Table for Father's Day, 6/17/18  at 6:45 PM.  When we arrived the restaurant was closed.  Not even the courtesy of an email warning us."}
{"text":"Very yummy Easter European Food. Pricey but yummy. Love the stuffed cabbage. The ambience is wonderful."}
{"text":"Just had a fantastic meal. First of all, Brad, our server was excellent.  He knew the menu and walked us through it making sound recommendations and not missing a thing. I had the short rib stroganoff, and two of our party had the chicken Kiev which was crispy and well seasoned. We had donuts for desert with homemade Nutella and vanilla creame. A great place to get food from regions that generally aren't well represented in most towns. The restaurant is fantastic looking btw."}
{"text":"Leslie and I cannot say enough about this beautiful restaurant. We met Will and our experience was phenomenal! Their Bloody Mary's are out of this world. If you're feeling adventurous put your culinary fate in their hands and they'll transport your taste buds to as close to nirvana as possible.  Again can't say enough. The next time we are in Scottsdale this will be our premier dining destination.  Cheers Will,  Alex and Leslie"}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday dinner. The last time I was here it was Sandbar, so I was excited to see the remodel. I love all the textures in the design. The pillars on the patio are really different. Ok, so we ordered quite a bit of food, but I'll comment on my choice the braised beef perogies. They were delicious! I would definitely order them again and I am not normally a perogie fan, but the braised beef sold me. I also ordered a Moscow Mule with passion fruit I believe and it was also worth ordering again. All in all if you're looking for a new atmosphere and unique menu then try this restaurant.  The staff and owner were extremely polite and professional. I will be coming back to try out some of the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience for dinner. Excellent service from Natalie, very informative and attentive, without being \"stuffy\". we had duck and salmon. The salmon was perfectly prepared, with outstanding flavor. The half Duck, was also expertly cooked, but the recipient must be willing to be a hands on diner. My Octopus app was also perfectly cooked with a great presentation of accompaniments  Fresh made crepes and doughnuts our desserts, each with assorted accompaniments. This was a great dinning experience, start to finish; the manager, David, even stopped by. He was also a gracious representative of this very nice new Scottsdale venue, cant wait to go back !"}
{"text":"First time here at this Eastern European restaurant, and trying the Borscht... This Russian soup is freaking fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great place for eastern european food, which can be hard to find. Even harder to find is one that does it up as well as this place. I'm ukrainian and I consider finding a place that has good russian/slavic type food a rare treat. This place exceeded my expectations, and at a price cheaper than I was expecting to pay with such nice service and ambiance. The cabbage rolls and chicken kiev were amazing."}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant! I came here for the UYEISC hosted by the effervescent Monica O. I liked that they had spacious seating outside with lights that created a romantic atmosphere. We sat inside and I had a view of the patio through their large windows.  The service here was wonderful, Stephanie and the gentleman she was training were hospitable and attentive to our table. I perused the menu earlier in the day to familiarize myself but still wasn't sure what I wanted. So I ordered two starters: the wild mushroom pierogis and the smoked salmon and potato pancake. I got the first order as an appetizer and the presentation was lovely. The pierogis were filling and I liked the crunchy onions on top. There was a drizzle of some sort of sauce on the board which had a funny taste, not sure exactly what it was but I tried it and left it.  Later my second order came out with the other dinner plates and I noticed it had red flakes on the pancake. I asked our server if it was bacon and she said yes, and I replied I don't eat bacon and didn't know it would be included since it wasn't listed on the menu. She was kind and offered to have it made without the bacon, but I decided my one dish was plenty (which it was) and she took it back and didn't charge me for it.   I had a craving for dessert and got their Lithuanian donuts, aka beignets, and they came with vanilla sauce, chocolate sauce and berries. The beignets were too doughy on the inside but I enjoyed them anyways. I liked that it had two sauces and berries, those were a nice touch.  European food is too meat-heavy for me and it's not my food genre of choice so I wouldn't come back but I'm glad I tried it. They honored our discounts and were accommodating to our needs and I appreciated that."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and great music! We ordered appetizer, main dish, and dessert. Although I was getting full but I was really enjoy the food. Kepta Duona, rye bread and duck fat, is unique and tasty. Stuffed cabbage rolls are so delicious with perfect combination of rice and meat. Spurgos are great to end the meal with this deliciousness mini donuts with vanilla cream, hazelnut chocolate, and strawberry marmalade."}
{"text":"What a great find! Our server, Brad, recommended the Chicken Kiev, one of the best chicken dishes I've ever tasted. We started with the potato pancakes with salmon.... also a winner. Don't hesitate to try this great restaurant. Try to get a table where Brad is your server."}
{"text":"Evening didn't start great.  We made online reservation through yelp and they tried to sit us in a high top on the bar.  This was our second time here and this happened the first time too.  The restaurant was pretty full but some tables were still open. I have no idea why restaurants do this online reservation folks - they aren't the only ones.  Anyway, we got moved after complaining and then our server was nowhere to be found.  Luckily, an excellent live band - Blue Savanah was playing and they are awesome.  Eventually our harried servers came, we got some strong drinks and settled in for the night.  The food was superb, especially the octopus appetizer.  The vibe in here is interesting, like a Russian (I'm think they're Lithuanians) nightclub that you see in movies (John wick) but in a good way.  Really like place overall."}
{"text":"Brought 7 girl friends to celebrate a bachelorette dinner at Sonata's Restaurant couple of weekends ago and unfortunately I am not super impressed considering the price range of their entree's were on the high range. The ambiance was cozy and artistic, there were beautiful decors all through out the restaurant and the singer was really nice.   Our group ordered a little bit of everything - our most favorite was the Pork Shashlik. The meat was tender and juicy, the aroma of the jasmin rice was incredible and the portioning was just right.   Our least favorite was the Smoked Pork Belly confit. The fat and grease was just too much. It tasted bland and the fat just melted like oil in our tongue. (Mind you, this is not the first time we've had pork belly. We eat pork fat almost with everything).  The smoked beef stroganoff and chicken kieve was okay - it had nothing special about it.   The most frustrating part was our server being too slow. We came in at 9pm and the crowd wasn't so busy so we were hoping to get fast service yet he still took a while in taking our order, serving us drinkings and checking on us.   Our overall experience was okay but I don't think we will be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant has changed its head chef, so the review will take this into account.  I've been here on three separate occasions - once when they were first open (within the first few months), again a few months on, and (most recently) on Friday (2-23-18).  First time was obviously good enough to return a second time. This past occasion, though, something was decided different.  Friday nights in just about any city is going to be busy, but this place was surprisingly empty, with only a handful of table/people and no one outside (compared to the restaurant we couldn't get into earlier, which was packed full). That should have been the first clue.  We were seated immediately and discussed what we were going to eat and drink. When the waiter came over (the name Brad seems to come to mind), tagging along was a trainee, my partner noticed that he smelled of cigarettes and a distinct note of cannabis. Quite off-putting. Drinks and food were ordered: Partner had a gin and tonic and the sea bass, while I opted for first a lemonade (they were out of it), then an ice tea (only green tea), and the porkchop.  The waiter mentioned that there was a new chef (second clue) and they were \"promoting\" certain entrees over others to gather feedback... the porkchop happened to be one of them (if I am remembering correctly).   A little while later, another party was sat next to us... but no one came over to take their order in quite a long time. We watched them get up and leave. Then the drink came out...  The gin and tonic was, as my partner stated, so watered down. My green tea was more like a mint tea. I've had green tea before at other restaurants before, but this was by far the worst. My partner commented on the oddity that for such a nice establishment - given the decor, ambiance, and general area (Scottsdale after all) - the wait staff were in jeans. Not quite appropriate for the rest of the visuals and expectations. Then a live band began setting up (drum box, vocals, keyboard, and acoustic guitar).  Another party was placed next to us and my partner again lamented the atmosphere, the watery drink, and anything else they could point out that wasn't up to par. I attempted to calm them and encourage them not to talk so blatantly with another table next to us - a little impolite.  The food showed up a while later and looked good, if a little out of place... The sea bass's plate was 12-14 inches in diameter with only the middle 3-5 inches being the actual food. Mine was plated on their more standard flat board (no edges and is like eating off the table). My partner immediately noticed that while the fish was warm everything else was essentially cold or lukewarm. The porkchop was of similar standards - it looked cooked, but upon cutting into it (knife was dull), it felt spongy or rubbery. Picking it up by the bone, I noticed that the bottom was unusually not as cooked as the top - almost like it was boiled then lightly grilled. The lighting wasn't fantastic but my partner could have sworn it was pink in the middle (I was about a third of the way through, only eating a few bites, mostly interested in what it looked like further in).... boy, once I got closer to the bone, it only got more pink.   I stopped eating the pork at that point. The brussels sprouts were OK - some were cooked well, other quite hard. Both of us noted that lack of seasoning on any of the food.  Not once did the waiter come back to see if my partner wanted another drink, but one of the managers came over and asked about the food. I naturally said it was a bit too pink, to which his reply was that he could have it recooked.... Why would I want a recooked piece of meat that is already mostly cut up trying to find good meat? I declined and we were mostly looking to get out of there quickly. Food was eventually removed (my partner noticed that the live band had played the same song four time in the past hour) and we received the check. Nothing had been removed or altered from the bill and a very paltry tip was left.  Even as we left, we noted how many table were still empty at 7:30 pm... on a Friday in Scottsdale.   I will not be returning."}
{"text":"First time at this new restaurant ( Here with a friend for lunch).  Friendly staff, didn't rush us.  Delightfully fresh menu; not the same old dishes.  Especially loved the mushroom barley soup. Lush yet cozy decor.  Tables spaced for privacy.  Only hint would be they need a few throw pillows for those seated at the plush, but very deep, sofas and banquettes.  Will definitely return for dinner."}
{"text":"Very nice all around - food, service, ambience, price, & live music! Great efforts in keeping tract on changing each used plate."}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars if there was a separate rating for our server James.  He was wonderful and always checked back to see how we were doing.  There was a large group.  I had the kugelis fixed differently then I am used to after living in a Lithuanian neighborhood in Chicago for 27 years but it was very good.  Another person at my table sent her potato pancakes back because the salmon on top (never heard of salmon on top of potato pancakes) was bitter.  James had no problem letting her order something else.  While I didn't sit where the gold couch was I could tell by looking at it that it would be uncomfortable to have a meal while sitting there.  Also if you are sitting in the upper level there needs to be a railing with the stairs.  Someone could fall when going down those steps.  All in all a pleasant experience although the food was a little odd after having regular Lithuanian food.  This is definitely what they call upscale.  The menu is the same for both lunch and dinner so prices for lunch are pretty high."}
{"text":"Sonata's restaurant has everything you need to escape the every day typical routine, and enjoy wonderful decorations and patio, quality cuisine and drinks, and really be entertained! The service is outstanding and the staff is ready to please. Loved it, and plan to join with family & friends on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"We went here for a party with the AZ Cardinals at Christmas time and it was AMAZING! Excellent service and really friendly staff. I drank A LOT on this night, but I distinctly remember that the bites of food we were served were DELICIOUS! There was a crispy, fruity fois gras appetizer and a really juicy slider."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom right before NYE and Nicole was amazing. My mom has allergies to spicy food. Nicole and Nico the manager were very accommodating. Nicole was so sweet, knowledgeable and friendly to us. If you ever come here I recommend asking to sit in her section. I also recommend eating the foie gras, the bone marrow and the filet mignon with lobster. ALL AMAZING!!! Thank you Nicole!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! One start just because the food tasted good. But the portion are so much smaller than the pictures on yelp! Extremely Over price"}
{"text":"I visited Sonata several times after its opening. Previous review 5 stars. On my last visit last week, I ordered the Kepta Duona, Really delicious! however, I ordered the beef Stroganoff was not that great.. (I had it before when the restaurant just opened it was delicious). This time around, the beef stroganoff seemed like a different dish (the meat texture was not the same), did you change chefs/ cooks?  Anyways, the restaurant is unique, and live music makes it a good place for a dinner."}
{"text":"Decent. Food was okay; I loved my sea bass but my husband did not like his lamb. Ambience was weird. Service was below average. Prices were high for the quality we received (not the quality of food, just everything all together). I would not give a high recommendation because we had quite an odd experience. I tend to not give many negative reviews, but I came here because of the high reviews. I think with some work, this could be a fantastic restaurant..but for now, I would not give my recommendation. I hope things change!"}
{"text":"never again!!  Really terrible experience.  If zero stars was an option you would get that."}
{"text":"So I accidentally ran into this restaurant looking for the Restart bar. I wanted a smoothie.  There was a sign outside for the Restart bar and even logos on a door (no longer there) so I was highly thrown off when I walked into a big open fine dining restaurant that was completely empty. A man helped me  and said that the restart bar was gone and that it now only the Sonata's restaurant.  My boyfriend and I decided to go back and try it out because the friendliness and the appeal of the restaurant was just enough to wanna go back. We went for dinner it was absolutely amazing.  We went on a Wednesday night at like 7:00 p.m. It wasn't very busy, the atmosphere is very quiet,  romantic and very personable. We didn't get any appetizers. We did get drinks  while we waited for our food. The bf got an old fashioned and I got a Pom- circumstance. there are absolutely delicious. For dinner the bf got the 16 oz ribeye steak, truffle fries and root vegetables. I got the Chicken Kiev. Loved everything. It was just enough food to fill you but still enough room for dessert. We got coffee's and the donut holes. Everything tasted phenomenonal.   All the staff was super friendly, the general manager came and talked to us for a bit. We would definitely go back again and highly recommend it. Great restaurant for Valentine's day."}
{"text":"Right from the start everything seemed off.. From getting to our table, to menus, drink order,  and the hour wait for our APPETIZER, to the hour and half to our dinner. Service plays a big role in the dining experience and it very much lacks here.  Unfortunately this was the first time visiting and will be our last."}
{"text":"Our first time here and loving the food. Eastern European cuisine. Will try more dishes and post about them but so far, happy to find this great spot. Dominic is an attentive bar tender and knowledgeable on the favorite dishes."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to be. We discovered a great restaurant. Great atmosphere,  delicious   food , out of ordinary cocktails,  exceptional outside patio!!  We had such a great experience with my company! We had about 20 people and we tried almost everything  on the menu.  We had never tasted such a different cuisine!!  I truly recommend this place to everyone.!!"}
{"text":"I was really was excited to check this place out after reading the reviews. We started out with Kepta Duona. Sadly, it tasted like a hard stale crouton covered in cheese. Next we had the potato pancakes. Tasted like a greasy pancake. One bite of each I was done with appetizers. My husband wasn't a fan either and asked me if we should go somewhere else for our entrees.  I decided we should stick it out. I played it safe and ordered the soup which was very nice. My husband ordered the beef stroganoff. He was also pleased with his entree. I figured dessert would be a gamble so we skipped it. Service was friendly but a bit slow. The restaurant is very beautiful just not a fan of the food."}
{"text":"Just mediocre. Server was very friendly, but had to ask the chef everything. Totally different me u that what they post on their site as well."}
{"text":"This lovely restaurant on the northwest corner of Scottsdale and Gold Dust has been a favorite since opening two years ago after major renovations. Beautifully designed by its Lithuanian owner, its food matches the quality of the interior. The menu has been stretched to include favorites with special touches, such as the salmon on a bed of black rice. The menu has something for everyone, although a stronger nod to patrons with gluten free needs would be welcome. Don't miss the desserts and sharing works well.  Our server, Gina, deserves kudos for her helpfulness, warmth and overall professional approach to her job. Nico, the manager who came on board in October, is similarly warm and enthusiastic about his job. We look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Sonatas has gone from great to HORRIBLE!! The executive chef Josh is no longer with the restaurant and hasn't been for several months. Sonata has been posting on social media about their food with Josh's name still on it when in fact chef Josh has moved on. Sonata, the owner who portrays herself in a huge picture on the wall from 20 years ago, is clearly all about herself and caters to her Lithuanian guests more than loyal, paying customers. Food has lost it's authenticity and is terrible. I wouldn't waste your time dining at this establishment.    Sonata,  In your previous reply you stated you removed your media content with chef Josh's name. However, this email amongst others was blasted to multiple people all around the valley just a month ago. Josh has not worked there since the end of June. You also had his name posted on your website up until a week ago. In regards to your recipes, of course they have not changed because they are chef Josh's. You wouldn't have those recipes if he hadn't provided you with them. I have been in multiple times and I can tell you my experience has never been consistent. Service is terrible, and your lack of management on the floor is a reflection of that. The only consistency you had in that restaurant was chef Josh's food and now that he's gone  your restaurant is just another option in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!  I've driven down Scottsdale thousands of times but never saw it.  It was a Google search that brought us.  Amazing food, awesome service and really nice decor.  The short rib was outstanding and the foie gras was correctly done... which is a rare find.  I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone that wants to experience  good food from a talented chef.  Well done.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great Eastern European food. I'm from Brooklyn ny so we have tons of Russian Ukrainian Lithuanian restaurants. Their Olivier salad is amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing meal, the charcuterie board was wonderful!  Jim was super attentive & fun, his menu suggestions were on point... definitely will make an Spring Training tradition"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in an unassuming shopping center near Shea in Scottsdale.    We have only dined at the bar but the restaurant was packed when we were there on a Friday.   Live music is a plus.   Their bartender/mixologist Will is amazing!    Drinks are fabulous and service is impeccable.  Although this genre of food is not usually my go to, everything we tried last time was delicious.   Save room for their house special Kepta!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is wonderful at Sonata's. Great decoration. Sitting outside is most pleasant and has great views. Very peaceful on a Sunday afternoon. We enjoyed a salad that was very good before dinner with olives, Feta cheese and a light dressing. I had the Beef stroganoff- very tasty!!  My fiend had  a chicken dish. We finished dinner with the fried dumplings. Brad our waiter was wonderful!  Will visit again."}
{"text":"Came here for the live music (classical guitar) stayed for the great food and vibe. I ordered the salmon and my husband had the braised short rib stroganoff - both were fantastic! Definitely worth coming here for live music, glass of wine and a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Love love love this place it's so conveniently located. The ambiance is romantic and unique. The food is excellent! The service and drinks are on point and let's not mention the hospitality..... Gina, Dominic, and Will have made an impression! very welcoming ( David is cool too! )......great date night spot!"}
{"text":"The design interior very interesting with all the pictures, design, and ornaments but still classic, cozy, and welcoming. The setting of the chair was set perfectly where you can still talking nicely even the restaurant was full. Perfect atmosphere for family, romantic dinner, or after work at the bar.  The foods were amazing! My favorite were the dumpling, Olive salad (or oliver? lol), and donut! I ordered drink Loaded Mule, that was my new crush drink, so smooth, citrusy, and fresh.   Thanks again Sonata for all the services plus all the goodies! I went home with happy tummy, would love to come back again, and YES would love to recommended this place!"}
{"text":"This was such a special experience for my husband and I. We came here for our 10 year anniversary dinner, and were treated to food that, quite simply, we don't get to eat at many restaurants here in Phoenix. I had the stuffed cabbage and the meat was so flavorful and the tomato sauce juuuust right...mmmm....I truly savored every bite. My husband had the brisket perogies which could have been a little bigger for an entrée, but were really delicious. We also had the bread with cheese (I don't remember what its called), and it was good, but nothing super special. But the entrees were great and I can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Wow! Sonata's is outstanding. We decided to try someplace new. We went with two other couples - a total of 6 adults. They gave us the Chef's Table. Gorgeous restaurant. Amazing food! Awesome cocktails. Live music. Great prices. The staff was outstanding. Our waitress, Kristina, was amazing. She took good care of us. We will come back."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I have been here twice and will definitely be back. They lost 1 start because the last server I had made several mistakes. The first visit I had amazing service. They have live music that is at a good volume and enjoyable. The wine selection is good. I highly recommend the Uncensored Red Blend. Be sure to call for reservations especially if you plan to go at a busy time or night."}
{"text":"Wow...wow.  I had read some positive reviews of Sonata's and decided to take my parents there when they were in town visiting last week.  We were all blown away by every aspect of this dining experience.  The first thing of note was that the decor is very modern but comfortable.  The patio looked amazing.  I will be back to dine out there when it warms up a little.  Second, our service was stellar.  Our server, Gina, was friendly and knowledgeable about the restaurant and the menu.  The manager even took the time to come over and speak with us for a few minutes after our meal.  Last but not least, THE FOOD!  I was skeptical about Eastern European cuisine because it's not my usual go-to, but I am so glad that I tried it.  Everything on the menu sounded delicious.  For an app, we had the highly recommended Kepta Duona--rye bread fried in duck fat and smothered in cheese.  It was one of the best things I have ever eaten.  For our entrees, I had the short rib stroganoff, my mom had the 1/2 duck, and my dad had the lamb.  We loved all of them.  My mom said she'd never had better duck, and the short rib practically melted in my mouth.  Just FYI, it's not a typical stroganoff.  Instead of being mostly noodles, it is a large piece of short rib atop a small portion of noodles.  I was initially disappointed because I love pasta, but that disappointment dissolved as soon as I took my first bite of the meat, which deserved to be the focus of the dish.  All of the desserts sounded amazing, but we just didn't have room!  I can't wait to go back again and again!"}
{"text":"I've never truly been \"wowed\" by a restaurant. That all changed when I tried Sonata's!   They quickly had us sat on their cozy and comfortable patio for Sunday brunch. Usually one would have to wait over an hour for a table at noon on a Sunday - but the staff at Sonata's really aims to create a great experience for everyone. They welcome you warmly, no matter how busy they are. (Take a hint Hash Kitchen).  The blueberry pancakes and crab BLT were both divine. The coffee was piping hot and the mimosas perfectly hit the spot.   All in all, this is my new favorite spot. I'm glad I live in the neighborhood across the street!"}
{"text":"Excellent Restarant! Came in a few days ago after driving by a couple times and I noticed the parking lot was always full of cars so I figured I just have to check it out for myself.   My whole entire visit was exceptional, from the moment I walked in I was pleasantly greeted by the hostess which automatically made me feel very welcome. It only got better after that, our server was very attentive and was quite knowledgeable about the type of dishes they serve especially for a new comer to the Eastern European cuisine they feature. I decided to take my servers recommendation and ordered the Sea Bass and my friend who was with me ordered the Short Rib. Both dishes were out of this world delicious and plated so beautifully. Of course we just had to try a dessert to complete the meal so we ordered the chocolate cake. I again was in heaven immediately after my first bite just a perfectly decadent dessert. The manager even came by and introduced himself and asked us how we were enjoying our evening. It was definitely the perfect ending to a very enjoyable experience.   Sonatas is a beautifully stunning restaurant with a wonderful staff and just the most amazing food you can get in Arizona in my opinion. I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful AND so is the food!  I was with a Meetup group for lunch today.  Everyone ordered something different.  Every meal was beautifully plated.  I had the cabbage rolls.  The person across from me ordered the pot stickers with pork belly.  Someone else had pot stickers that had (what looked like) a mushroom gravy over them.  One woman had the sauerkraut soup.  She said it was delicious.  I think the one disappointment was another member of the group ordered the duck kabobs and it came as a gyro--not what he expected, but he said it was good.  Several people had the crepes for dessert.  I ordered the perogies with chocolate whipped cream.  All desserts were served on slate plates.  Service was sketchy, but the waitress was new and working our table of 8 by herself.  She really needed help.  In spite of this, I'm still rating this restaurant 5 stars.  I would definitely go back if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Thank you Groupon, for bringing me to Sonata's.  Thank you Sonata's for being on Groupon.  What a wonderful restaurant!  Everything from the service, the food, the atmosphere is top notch.  I wish only the best for this establishment to prosper...Highly recommended to all!  I had the Croque Madame Sandwich- very tasty!  Not a ton of beers on tap, but they do offer a good selection, including some not found in many other places in Arizona.  There's also a fantastic juice bar as well....Will have to give it a go next time we're there."}
{"text":"Excellent service, incredible desert. Only disappointment was the pork shank which seemed really overlooked to where it was really tough and hard to chew. Overall, a very pleasant evening."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great European food. The decor is very unique and this would be appropriate place for the more mature crowd"}
{"text":"Pros: we sat on the patio and it was super cute. We ordered oysters, and they were good. Cons: they only had 8 oysters and could not fill our order of 12. We were notified and agreed to still take the oysters at a lower price. I ordered a drink they told me they didn't have... a few minutes later. Both, $14 drink and two orders of $21 oysters were on the bill. I'm not sure how you mess up a bill by $35 but okay"}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be good, so I gave it 3 tries since they have been opened and each time was a disappointment. I guess you can say I am a glutton for punishment.  I like to give restaurants a true test before writing a review.   Today was my third time and I don't know why I keep hoping things will change. The first time I was there was late at night for dessert when they just opened. The place is beautiful and the desserts were just OK. I figured they were only open a week and they have to work things out.   Second time we came there we chose to sit outside where the service staff never even recognized for 30 minutes after we were seated by the host. 20 minutes after we ordered the waiter came to tell us the kitchen was out of hose items. It took 20 minutes just to find out! The food that we did have was sub par. Everytime we asked for another drink, it would take at least 30 minutes to bring it. It was a disappointing night out and all our friends agreed it was not a place they would go back to.   Ok, I waited a full year to try It again since I figured they probably had plenty of time to  work out all the kinks and I should give them one more shot and boy am I disappointed. Today was a horrible experience.  We went there for Father's Day to enjoy a brunch that was advertised with live music and fresh food. As we arrived, we noticed the place was practically empty so I got nervous already. We hoped for the best and sat down. We were asked for our brunch drink orders, I ordered a latte and my husband and kids ordered fresh squeezed orange juice. The juice arrived tasting like nasty artificial tang, but the waitress insisted that it was fresh squeezed. We knew that was a blatant lie and Later after the manager also swore that it was fresh squeezed orange juice, the waitressed fessed up and said no, it isn't. \"They were supposed to have fresh OJ,but this is not it, so we took it off the bill for you. \" Ding ding ding, you took it off the bill? How KIND of you. So I'm thinking, I'm paying $50 per person for brunch and you're giving me a tang fake OJ and not even informing us about the truth. Then I go over to the Buffet, I noticed the sad looking salads that have been standing around for hours with Soggy croutons. The shrimp were not on ice and half of the tray was just soggy empty lettuce. The smoked salmon was just on regular trays that were room temperature and it was looking as if it was sitting out all morning. The sides were starting to get that crunchy nasty look to them. I was sanitation certified when I owned a restaurant and these were all red flags for food poisoning. Not keeping seafood on ice and not rotating it often is a sure fire way to make your guests sick. My husband ordered scrambled eggs and they came out in a plate full of water. It seriously looked like soupy eggs. The waffle my daughter grabbed from the buffet was over cooked and hard as a rock. The bacon was sad and soggy too.   To top it off, there was no live music playing. I asked the hostess when the music will be starting and she said there is no music. So what happened to the live music? She said they had an issue with the sound system and that's probably why it wasn't happening today. After the food fiasco and the music, I spoke to the manager and he said the music guy is on a break and is coming back. Coming back? I told him the hostess( 2 hostesses actually) said there was no music today. He did apologize but at that point, I was fed up and since we actually didn't eat ANY of the food, we got up and left. I left a $20 on the table for the wait staff as a courtesy and the manager and I both agreed they are not ready for brunch at this restaurant. Too many things need to still be worked out. Staff needs to be informed of everything, food needs to be fresh and not sitting out for hours, and you seriously can't change for a coffee or oj when you do a full brunch buffet. I understand charging extra  for alcohol, but a kids juice?   I really wish this restaurant success but I guarantee I will not be coming back or recommending them to anyone ever."}
{"text":"BEAUTIFUL restaurant, bar and patio. Come with an open mind because the menu is original and wonderful. The basics are reborn with their Caprese  starter...the herbs and flavors in their dishes are wonderful. Will was behind the bar tonight and our biggest reason for returning in the near future. The cocktails...wine selection were impressive and sounds like it's only going to get better. Portions are hearty and priced reasonably compared to anywhere in the valley."}
{"text":"I have been to Sonata's twice in the last few months and have had two different experiences. When you walk in, the atmosphere is warm and inviting. Even the patio bar is pretty. I think they did a fantastic job with the design.   The first time I tried Sonata's, my friend and I were quickly greeted by the hostess. We were seated immediately and our server, while pleasant was not as attentive as I would have liked. We started with the smoked braised beef perogies, which were delicious! I ordered the chicken kiev and my friend ordered the hay smoked lamb. The chicken kiev was rich, creamy, and crunchy. It was really good. My friends lamb was good, not great. He had a difficult time eating it because it was resting on the hay, and the dish they serve it on is very small, so cutting a chop was sort of difficult. He liked the side better than the lamb itself. I tried the currant martini, and during this visit it was delicious had a nice berry and almost cherry flavor.   The second time I visited Sonata's, we were again greeted, but there seemed to be some confusion about where to seat us and where our hostess was taking us. Our server was delightful, she was very friendly and attentive. I ordered the black currant martini, but this time it tasted like lemon and bad raspberry vodka. We started with the potato perogies, which were very good! I ordered the stroganoff with egg noodles. While the noodles had a great chew, there was like 2-3 in my bowl, which I find a little pathetic for the price. The beef was extremely overcooked, making it almost impossible to chew through some portions. My friend got the chicken kiev, which was again, delicious!   I would go back to try some other items. I hope to see more consistency, and I would like a bit better portions for some of the prices they are charging."}
{"text":"Bottom line on top: Sonata's has very innovative food that is well-prepared and enthusiastically served, and provides a happy dining experience.  It's unique menu makes it a \"must do\" in Scottsdale.  Sonata's is the epitome of the modern fine dining genre, which can provide a great experience if the food is good, or be a total waste of money if it is not.  Fortunately, at Sonata's the food is imaginative, different but not too different, and very well prepared.  By completely remodeling an existing space, Sonata's created an open atmosphere, with an inviting outdoor area.  As is the current style, it is fairly noisy inside, especially when they have a live singer or band.  I guess the theory today is that people want it noisy so that they don't have to talk to their table companions and can concentrate on their cell phones.  I don't feel that way - a subdued murmur is what I want to hear, but Sonata's does not go overboard with the noise and it was tolerable on a day when the restaurant was not full.  You might want to say that Sonata's aimed for a casual comfort food vibe, with  sports on TVs and a warm, friendly staff, but the food belies that.  You will not get American comfort food here.  The menu has a reasonably large selection of dishes with a noticeable Baltic influence (the owner is Lithuanian).  It has about 20 small plates and salads, and 10 larger entrees.  You can view the menu online to see northern European favorites like borscht (nothing at all like what  you get in a jar), cabbage rolls, and potato pancakes with duck comfit (decent in themselves but accompanied by two stunning condiments).  You can also get rack of lamb (roasted with hay!) and filet mignon - these two at surprisingly moderate prices.  Note:  Go with the intention to share plates because Sonata's serves \"European style\", meaning the dishes come out when they are ready and not all at the same time.  But definitely go."}
{"text":"Wow this place is phenomenal! We are foodies from Portland, Oregon, here in Scottsdale for a conference. We don't eat meat, so to start we ordered the Pickled Herring, and the Smoked Salmon Potato Pancakes. We also shared the Crab Stuffed Cod entrée. We practically licked our plates clean, it was so good, really well executed by the chef. Our server was Hazar...he was professional, perfectly attentive and very personable, so nice, we loved him. He totally made our experience. We'd come back in a second and request him! The restaurant ambience & decor is stunning!"}
{"text":"My son wanted to try some place new so Sonats's it was on a Saturday night. We made reservations and they said they don't take any reservation after 6:30 so we had to make an early one.   This place is very impressive. Great ambiance. Little dark but I just loved their decorations with the ropes and logs. The owners (husband & wife) are from Lithuania and there is this huge picture of some woman singer. Asked the waiter and said that this is Sonata (one of the owner).   Anyways, we started off with an Artisan Green salad which was pretty good. The dressing wasn't over powering so I thought that it was good. My son and his friend ordered the Caprese salad. This is not the ordinary Caprese salad. Really good and served with three slices of bread. Dump this on the bread and wow. Only downfall is that we wanted some more bread with this and they bought out four more slices. Found out on my bill that they charged me $4 for 4 slices of bread. Man I could have bought a whole loaf at the store for that price. Okay stop complaining.   I had the hay roasted lamb persillade. They told me if was lamb chops so I was excited. Love lamb chops. They bring it out and it's very impressive. The hay is in fire over the lamb chops. I ordered it medium. When I got it it was rare. Still ate it but I will have to say that it wasn't anything special. Presentation is outstanding but the food is just ok. Not bad. Not great.   My wife ordered the beef stew which was served in the clay pot. Didn't try it but she said it was good. A little to salty for her liking but said it was good.   My son and his friend both ordered the smoked beef short ribs. One had homemade stroganoff and the other with mashed potatoes. First words out of their mouths were \"oh my gosh\". So moist and tender. They really enjoyed it.   As for the server. He was okay. Not great especially because they weren't busy at all. They bring bottle water to your table and we had to ask to get our bottle refilled a few times. He just seemed very disinterested is us but that's okay.   So Yelp has a check-in that Sonata's will give you 10% off your bill if it's over $100. So I show it to this guys and he says yea we do this so that people will write reviews for their restaurant. So I use up the offer right in front of him. Get my bill and no 10% off. Really. I'm not the person who likes to make a big fuse and just left. Very uncool.   So I would say that the ambiance is really great. Very relaxing atmosphere and enjoyable. The food is okay. Nothing to wow about and really surprised about all these 5 star ratings. Service was very lacking and didn't help that they forgot my Yelp discount. The server wanted me to even mention his name so we had Hazar for when I write a review for their discount. Hahaha. Sorry but I don't write review for bribes. I tell it like it is.   Anyways, there were just too many missteps to even consider coming back but hey this is just me. Enjoy"}
{"text":"three words: attention to detail.  Everything in this restaurant is so carefully chosen with so much attention to detail from the bar selection, food recipes and plate presentation, to the live music, furniture, and lighting.   PERFECT DATE PLACE.   This place redefined 5 stars for me after the most enjoyable dinner I have had. My family got the beef stroganoff, pork skewers, and the crab stuffed cod. all very delicious and carefully paired with flavor.   While we enjoyed our dinner, we also were entertained by live jazz music and many Frank Sinatra classics.   I do agree with some other reviews that there is a more \"mature crowd\" but this crowd knows how to have fun. Many were dancing and mingling, really creating an awesome night.   Visiting from out of town but will defensively return every time we are in the area. Truly splendid!"}
{"text":"Let me start with the pros: the live music was great, beautiful lighting and atmosphere. The food however was realllly lacking.  Being from Eastern Europe I was very excited to dine here and eat things I was familiar with. The pierogi ruskie were What myself and the others in my party were mostly looking forward to...we were all disappointed.  They were not even close...I ordered a napoleon for dessert and what I got was layers of crepes with cream...the menu didn't mention that it was a crepe dessert. My kids ordered the crepes from the kids menu that were suppose to come with organic chocolate as the menu said, whAt they got was peanut butter. Now what if a kid is allergic to peanut butter? Don't you think the parent should have been told that it wasn't actually going to be chocolate. I also ordered the borscht, another disappointment...for some reason it tasted really sweet. Can't say I was happy with anything that was ordered. Needles to say I wouldn't go back..."}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere, decent food, slow but courteous service. Extremely overpriced food for the portion size - not worth it."}
{"text":"The kitchen closes at 10 FYI don't make reservations after that if you want food, they will say they're \"closed\"."}
{"text":"This Euro-inspired eatery flashes a bold middle-finger at conventional restaurant traditions. Time honored standards such as digestible ingredients, bringing drinks in under an hour or prompt waitstaff service are forgotten at Sonata's.   In the grand European style of shitty service, customers at Sonata's are asked to stand and physically locate, chase down and then interrupt their waiter's side conversations in order to get half the drinks they wanted. The food shares a close kinship with tires you might find dumped alongside a riverbank, and you are left with a delicate flavor-ballet of appartment fire and wet bag of trash, dancing across your taste buds.  Here, the diner is left to puzzle over the fate that has dragged them into the ignominious purgatory that is Sonata's Restaurant. Sonata's is however  Conveniently located next to a California Pizza Kitchen, offering diners a stunning view of people actually receiving palatable food to eat.   My hope is that the management will one day visit the CPK to study how a working restaurant should opperate, but alas, I fear they'll instead spend their time digging through CPK's dumpsters looking for the next Sonata's special."}
{"text":"We just moved from Los Angeles to Arizona and have had the pleasure of dining at Sonata's Restaurant several occasions. For dinner, I had the grilled octopus and it was     Outstanding!  For brunch, I have had the blueberry pancakes, the hamburger and have tried the omelette.  Perfection!! The Bloody Mary and vodka martini that their bartender makes are amazing!! The ambience and decor are luxurious and elegant.  First class and a wonderful atmosphere to enjoy a night out and the patio and outside bar is really hip!! Having worked in the entertainment industry, been exposed to renowned cuisine in and around Downtown LA and being exposed to a lot of eclectic restaurants I would say Sonata's is one restaurant you definitely want to check out. A great place for private events!!"}
{"text":"This place has a wonderful atmosphere - two huge bars and a very comfortable patio to hang out on. Also one of the most unique menus around. Eastern Europe fusion? Everything we tried was great. Just  finished brunch and we're already making plans to come back for a happy hour or dinner.  Also a shameless plug for our waiter, Conor,  who really took great care of us."}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice.  Cool outside area. Food, not so much.  Everything has too much sugar on it.  (sugar on their carrots. sugar on their meat. etc...) You have to pay for bread.  Yep, thats right.  We went there around Thanksgiving.  They said they had just altered their menu.  Didn't care for it at all."}
{"text":"Tried Sonata's last night with a Groupon.  Was very impressed with the decor and was surprised and happy to see quite a few patrons.  They seemed more on the older side.  It is quite elegant, very clean, new and pretty.  The menu is very unusual.  I am a big fan of Polish and Russian and all Eastern European food, but they take it to another level.  It can be a little too busy for some, including myself.  We sat down, opened our napkins, and the cutlery was not clean.  The black bread plates had water marks.  Nothing was polished.  Very disappointing.  The glassware is lovely.  The plates and dishware are trying to be hip and cool, but I found them very 80's and awkward.  We had cabbage rolls, pirogies and chicken Kiev.  Two of the three dishes arrived cold and had to be returned.  Once heated up, the cabbage rolls were excellent.  I would have given it 4 stars had the silverware been polished and clean, as well as the plates.  It's not something I would eat too often, since again, it is very done up.  If it were a little simpler, I could eat there once a week.  This type of food, in my opinion, needs to be more authentic and down to earth.  Oh yes, and the service is very average.  For the prices they charge and for it being an upscale restaurant, I would have expected more professional service, not the young kids who are not polished. The singer that night, Johnny Snowden, was excellent.  I drive all the way to Mesa from North Scottsdale for European food, so I wish this would have been more to my liking."}
{"text":"Ambiance - check. Great service - check. Fabulous food - check !  I've been in for happy hour before, good but not the cheapest price for that ever.   However, if you're coming in for a dinner that's excellent, but not overpriced, check this place out.  Simply fabulous. I had the Mediterranean shrimp with cous cous, and it as delicious !  Portions are not huge, but excellent in flavor and presentation."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service and great food!  I only have positive things to say with my experience at Sonata's Restaurant. From the moment the door was opened for me, the service was impeccable. I attended for a charity event that Sonata's Restaurant was great enough to host, the ambiance was exquisite and the overall experience left me impressed. All I know is, if I'm going to go anywhere worth spending money, Sonata's Restaurant is at the top of my list. You can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"The first customer service impression I received was unfortunate. I really wish I could have tried this place out. I noticed that there is also other reviews regarding negative input on making reservations, so I'm here to give my experience. I'm assuming this is a issue in the restaurant that the owner does not care to handle. I had gone on their website to make reservations for same night (a time that worked for our work schedule that night). It's a Saturday; and since they close at 12am, my husband and I decided to make a reservation no later than 11pm. So I went on their website to make the reservation. The table hours they gave me on their website ran up to 11:30pm. We decided to go with a 11pm reservation with regular seating. And just like that our reservation was confirmed, I was so excited. Then about 5 minutes later we received a call from the restaurant stating that last call is at 10pm, so we are required to reserve no later than 10pm. Unfortunately we would no longer be spending our date night here. I'm just confused as to why they would offer hours for tables on THEIR website later than 10pm if it's not possible. My advice to you is to call the restaurant to reserve. Don't do anything online, their system is inaccurate."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a family owned restaurant that the owners talk to each & every guest and ask questions to make sure their every dining experience was perfect?! This family really cares that you enjoy their food and dining experience! This restaurant has a very unique European menu that is so unique! Fast service! Large portions! Live music (not overly loud, which was nice!!) was playing on the weekend I visited with lots of couples dancing! Awesome place! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"They really make you feel welcome and at home here.  They care about the quality of their service, and for that reason I will be coming back!  Oh, and their ambiance is superb and they have a good variety of delicious food.  Thanks Sonata's for providing an exceptional experience."}
{"text":"Live music, comfort food and great service  Beautiful outdoor seating and good music make for a nice date-night.  We had the pirogis and octopus, and the sea bass and chicken kiev.  Everything was well-prepared and delicious."}
{"text":"Beautiful location & decor. Very trendy. Food presentation is very creative, however, I think the food choices are limited & unless you like that type of particular eastern European cooking the food isn't great.  I don't  think it appeals to broader public. The very creative dishes are overdone & over the top. Management wasn't accommodating to a bigger group of people, weren't able to order individually, ended up with huge bill requiring to split the bill equally. It wasn't fair to the couples that didn't order much. I've been there a few times not buy choice."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! The food and drinks are well priced. The service is excellent as well, the owner even stopped by our table to check money us.  We ordered a lot of Eastern European  food, from pyrogies to Chief Kiev. The wine and beer are excellent and well priced. We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Dinner last weekend - they have a nice menu with a variety of Mediterranean options. We shared a delicious burrata salad, short rib pierogis & octopus        Also requested a veggie side and they brought a beautiful entree of legumes,carrots, kale and other roasted vegetables. Waitstaff was accommodating and the wine list provides sufficient options for those who appreciate a yummy varietal. My biggest beef was the Manhattan, which was so-so and the cherry not worth the bite. Bummer  Overall a very nice evening out."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Sonata's last night and absolutely loved it! Sat at a bar table and Dominic helped us. We had a wonderful experience. Martinis were perfect and the food is top notch. We ordered a ribeye and the scallops and both were cooked perfectly. Had the hardest time choosing because the whole menu looked good. Can't wait to go back again! Love having a place so amazing so close to home."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant after seeing it advertised in the value clipper.  Very nice atmosphere and the food was very good, but the prices were fabulous!!  We had the schnitzel and the ham & gruyere crepes as a main entree and the Lithuanian donuts for dessert-yum!!  Our waitress, Gina, was very friendly and accommodating. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"If you are tired of steak, Italian or Mexican and just want something different give sonata's a try.  We came here on a late Sunday afternoon.  First impressions when we walked in were wow this looks like a cool place.  Nice bar area and great outdoor seating.  The one negative is the stripper yellow couches that looked uncomfortable for some of the guests that were sitting on them.  We had a table so no problems.  My martini was perfect and our guests Moscow mules were just right.  They don't really have much of a craft beer selection if that is what you are looking for.  The presentation of all the meals served was artistic.  Our table had pierogi's, stuffed cabbage, pork shank and smoked beef stroganoff.  Everyone raved about the food and our waiter was awesome and informative.  I am ticked that I forgot to use the Yelp check in.  Oh well, I will have to go back again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was dark modern & comfortable. Live music was good as instrumental.. not so much for the vocals. Food authentic & homemade. Nice liquor menu. Staff/service was excellent."}
{"text":"Dined here again with out of town guests last nite. I had the pork shank, nice sized portion and presentation. Several of our friends had the chicken Kiev. Most liked it, some of them were overcooked. Again, nice ambiance, and very good service from our waiter, Brad."}
{"text":"Enter into Sonata's and be transported into a different time and place, with plush yellow couches and chandelier inspired lighting.  I heard that this European restaurant was breaking into the brunch scene, so we went to go check it out.  Bottomless mimosas come with the meal, which is a MUST for brunch, so cheers! We ordered the duck crepe, the Cordon Bleu omelette, and the champagne French Toast. I tried a Coffee Cocktail with my meal, too. The Cordon Bleu omelette tasted delicious! They use gruyere cheese (my personal favorite) and it was so gooey, it was hard not to eat everything up in a few bites. The duck crepe was also super tasty and inspiring. It came with a white sour cream sauce that had brussel sprouts in it; the sauce complemented the duck in a new way I wouldn't have paired together and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The other dishes just were not my preference. I prefer bigger, fluffier pieces of french toast, and the Coffee Cocktail was interesting. It was sweet with a dollop of pink cream, what I think was yogurt, and though I know that some European countries really enjoy those types of flavors, it just wasn't for me. But hey, no regrets in trying new flavors! Overall though, it was such a fun experience and I enjoyed the savory dishes. Our server was exceptional and I have to give Sonata's props for having such amazing customer service. If you're a cheese lover, enjoy savory dishes, and want to try dishes off the beaten path, try them out."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Lovely atmosphere with great decorating. The staff is friendly and the prices for good-sized portions are reasonable. All of which leads us to the outstanding food. This is now one of our must places in the Valley of the Sun. They even use good coffee. What more can I say except frequent this restaurant so it stays open for my pleasure. By the way, if you like Top Chef, this is the kind of food Tom was looking for."}
{"text":"Went with 4 people. Would ONLY go back for the appetizer which was bread sticks with this amazing cheese and the dessert which was donuts of some sort.  The rest of the food we all felt was kinda average at best and not worth going back for."}
{"text":"Even Our Moderate Expectations Were Unmet  Looked forward to this place, as it looked reasonably hip and we just now are able to explore places having recently moved to the neighborhood.  We were seated, ordered two (simple) drinks while reviewing the menu.  Had to find our server 20 minutes later.  Where are our drinks?  \"The bartender is a little busy\".  Finally left, still without drinks.  The place was only half filled.  No one at the bar. And no bartender to be seen.  No apologies.  I believe I noted some comments about uneven service in prior Yelp reviews, so we were not totally surprised.  Too bad.  We were looking forward to the chicken Kiev.  May be next time...except we are not likely to return before they close due to inattentive service."}
{"text":"Blew my mind with the selection of nostalgic to the Central and Eastern European community of Arizona, freshly prepared masterpieces of meals. Let's start with the interiors and the drinks selection while we were deciding: impressive choices for the most sophisticated connoisseur. The place was full of people and lively, chamber of commerce had some sort of event, yet the classy and upbeat owners and the servers were kind enough to get us the best spot and were hospitable as in the Good Old World. Then the food came out and the presentation took it to another level. I happened to be a person who is especially competent to pass critical judgments because I have worked with art and beauty and am lucky to dine in the best places all around the planet. Sonata is one of the places that is worth my 5 stars all the way:* We love you."}
{"text":"Ambiance is incredible and the food is fantastic!!! You won't find another place in Scottsdale like Sonata's."}
{"text":"Came here for a Valentine's dinner. I heard of their Eastern European cuisine and wanted to try it out since I am from Romanian. I was really impressed by their patio, and the inside of the restaurant which has an elegant feel to it. It was a bit noisy. First we sat at the bar to have a drink because our table was not ready. The bartender greeted us immediately and offered to serve us shortly. I went off the menu with a drink which I did not really enjoy. For appetizer I ordered the borscht soup. I was expecting a nice size meatball, instead small pieces of ground beef. For entree I order their Fillet Mignon. As expected the meat was really tender however it was lacking flavor. I had to ask for salt and pepper which I wouldn't  expect to do at a nice restaurant. For dessert we ordered their Lithuanian beignets. They were cold and a little hard to chew. Overall not a bad experience we just weren't impressed with their food. Our waitress Gina was courteous and attentive! She made our visit enjoyable."}
{"text":"The short rib stroganoff was excellent!! Great, friendly staff. A Family member came over to greet the table. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great and the food was good but over priced for what it was. We were seated along the back wall on a long couch which was extremely uncomfortable and served room temperature tap water. Our server, a middle aged gent with a moustache, had a rudimentary knowledge of the menu items at best and was unable to answer any of our questions so we selected based upon other reviews. The chicken kiev reminded me of a frozen stuffed chicken dish we used to get from Schwans, only Schwans was much less costly and had a better flavor. The spare rib stroganoff was excellent and I would recommend it. Our friends had a salad, which did look delicious if a bit small, and the crab stuffed fish.   I would go again if invited by others but I won't recommend it. It does look like a nice pre-evening bar spot but my wife and I just don't drink."}
{"text":"We will give this a place another try as I think the experience was due to some extenuating circumstances. It was Day 2 of restaurant week (Saturday night) and they had a huge private party going inside that limited seating to outside (my preference anyway). The restaurant is beautiful and host was very friendly. It took our server 20 minutes before coming to the table. He was very nice and took our drinks. Those came fairly quick then he took our order which was off the restaurant week menu. It took another 40 minutes from the time we arrived before we got our appetizers. Then another 40 until my husband got his dish, scallops which were yummy. After he was finished they brought me a plate of complimentary scallops because my chicken Kiev was not ready yet. They were clearly experiencing a backup likely due to the party. I ate some and then my meal came which was delicious. Desert was not put in until our dinner plates were clean, so 20 minutes later those came out, also delicious. But after being there more than 2.5 hours (longest dinner I've ever had!) we were a bit frustrated. I just wish the waiter and manager had taken more ownership and acknowledgement on what was going on. The waiter apologized about the delay and stated they also had cooks walk out the night prior.  The manager offered the scallops but never really \"said\" much. The food was so good though and the place is very unique... we will give it one more try."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is a great place from the moment you walk through the door until you walk out. Everything from how you are greeted, the beautiful decor, the attention to your every need, and of course the food. Everything was perfect. The only thing that was disappointing, and it's more a personal thing is that when I made the reservations I included that it was our 40th Anniversary and there was nothing mentioned or done to acknowledge it. Other places we've gone in the past would wish us a happy anniversary and often provide a complimentary dessert and a glass of something bubbly to begin with. But as I said it's more a personal thing, and I'm not holding it against them. It was just a little disappointing. I still give them 5 stars. Anyway I transgress. Back to what is really important. It was explained to my wife and I that the concept is modern European. I grew up in a home where my grandmothers cooking was old world European. When I go to a European restaurant I go looking forward to have those tastes that remind me of a time long gone. So even though there were foods that sounded familiar such as borscht, and stuffed cabbage, as I read the descriptions it became clear this was not my grandmothers borscht or stuffed cabbage. As our waiter Brad said, this is a modern take on things. If you grew up as I did you need to leave the old world behind and come open to new twists on old dishes. So I had the borscht and stuffed cabbage, both were wonderful. Again not my grandmothers, but great in its own right. And again I have to emphasize how wonderful the service was. The menu is creative and surprising. There is so much my wife and I want to try we will be coming back many times."}
{"text":"I found this place in less than 2 minutes on Google, one look at the menu and the wives decided on this place!!  We first entered the restaurant we received a warm greeting.  Everything was sparkiling clean and the decor was very warm and inviting.  The waitress was super friendly and helpful with our party of 4. We started with the Happy Hour drinks, very good!!  Appetizers we ordered the octopus and salmon pancakes, being from the NW you get a little nervous ordering seafood in PHX.  The salmon could of been a Atlantic, but it turned out pretty good.  Main dish, the lamb shank and the braised short ribs was divine.  So tender you don't need a knife!!  Dessert, the dark chocolate cake was heavenly with a little heat (cayenne pepper)in it??!!  It reminded me of the Diablo cake at Tango's in Seattle!!  And the mini donuts is a must have also for dessert!!  We will definitely come back next year during Spring training!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great dinner.  The breads were delicious.  The trout was very good.  The stroganoff was EXCELLENT.  The atmosphere was terrific.  Though we were there on a Tuesday night, I was nonetheless surprised at how few people were there enjoying this fantastic food."}
{"text":"High-end, yet home'y experience. I parked right next to a Porsche, yet somehow still felt welcomed throughout my meal (I was wearing hiking clothes from a full day at the Grand Canyon). The server's have great advice, and the Manager even comes to talk to you about your experience. They share some of their recipes on-line, and they make that known to their customers, especially those who enjoy their meals. The Roasted Half Duck, although very boney as most ducks go, is a must have. On the other hand, the Slow-roasted Brisket Alfredo just as tasty as it sounds!"}
{"text":"This was a special treat!! Taste of the food was clearly important to the chef! Service was excellent and EVERYONE was sooo attentive! Enjoyed the music, and at just the right level to still have a conversation. Appreciated the overall experience!"}
{"text":"Sonata's is back on my list of places to go. I have been five times now. The first time was great! Service was spot on and the food was delicious. The next three times I had similar experiences as some of the lower rated reviews. Slow service, food coming out at different times and the food just not meeting expectations. So we took a break and went back tonight. The food was amazing. My hubby had the crab stuffed cod and loved it. The cheesy havarti bread was delicious (and I don't much care for havarti). The foie gras was amazing as always. I had the filet rare and it cut like butter. We got the donuts for dessert and they were delightful.  I would have given 5 stars but they were out of one ingredient for the foie gras and didn't tell us until the brought it out. Also, I had ordered something else for $18 but they were out so I ordered the $31 filet. They did comp one of my drinks though to make up for it. We are super early. 4:30 on a Saturday. Our server then got a table of 8 and another table for 2 and disappeared almost. (Maybe more I couldn't see) The table for 8 looked to be a little demanding/complicated so we understood. Just had to wait a while for a drink refill and to order dessert. Overall, glad to see they are back on track."}
{"text":"We went here for Easter brunch and paid roughly $80 per person. The service was horrendous, but the food was even worse. A total waste of money. Would absolutely never return."}
{"text":"We went there to celebrate my husband birthday with some friends, nice ambience very creative looks like fancy European restaurant, food is ok, portions average, pricey. But in general good, definitely we will be back."}
{"text":"Great night out with my husband. Totally relaxing sitting outside in the patio. Service was a bit slow but when no one came to our table we let the host know and Hazar came to our rescue. He was great. He turned everything around and was super attentive and nice. The food was Fantastic too. We ate late so a few of the items we were interested in were sold out. Hazar guided us to other items on the menu and we were totally content. Loved the meat and cheese platter!"}
{"text":"We greatly enjoyed our time at sonatas. This was our first time here.  We googled restaurants near us and chose sonatas. The atmosphere is very upscale, the music is very pleasant and peaceful. Our server, Karen,  helped us with our choices and our wine and she was just adorable and very pleasant. I told her how I liked my salmon prepared and it was exactly how I how I like my salmon. The salmon was wild which was is very important to me. My husband enjoyed his meal as well. The wine was delicious. We will be coming back! And we will be recommending sonatas to others! Next time we will request Karen to be our server."}
{"text":"Such a nice restaurant with fantastic service, food, and ambiance. Kudos to our awesome server Hazar for a great job of taking care of us!"}
{"text":"I recently came here for dinner on a Friday night with a large group.  We had reservations for the outside patio area. I loved the atmosphere - there was a DJ and dancing outside in the patio area and good crowd.   I only had the Artsian salad and added grilled chicken, but it was pretty good.  My friend had the chicken kiev and that was very tasty! I would definitely order that next time.  My only complaint was about the service.  We had a group of about 15 people, so people were arriving at different times and getting up and socializing, so i understand it may have been hard to keep track of people.  But I arrived with some other friends and remained seated for the first hour or so. The waiter took my friends' that I had arrived with drink order, but did not acknowledge me, and I waited about 45 minutes before I could get a drink order in. Fortunately, there was already water and a bottle of moscato that my friends already had at the table, so I drank that, but not necessarily what I wanted to drink if I had a choice. Some of my friends actually started just going up to the bar to get their drinks, rather than wait for the waiter to come back.  Another con, we were not able to split the bill by more than a couple of cards, so of course that was a hassle.  Overall, the food, drinks and atmosphere were great, but due to the service, I would probably only come back for drinks."}
{"text":"I have never had such a positive dining experience when eating on the road. I highly recommend this place!! I had the day scallops and then a creme brûlée peanut butter and banana dessert! I cannot get enough....LOL!!"}
{"text":"For a Mediterranean place I was expecting more from the menu, sadly the ambience lacks great food. I ended meeting a friend who told me that this place recently opened up. Since I'm on a low carb diet the delicious sounding fries dipped in the duck fat were not happening, instead I ordered the chicken wings on happy hour for $12. Yes $12 for chicken wings. I'll pay good money for good chicken wings but honestly this is the second restaurant that serves chicken wings like they just killed the chicken in back of the kitchen, I hate those style of chicken wings, why can't these damn restaurants serve real chicken wings. Anyways they were baked and had a side of BBQ that I avoided due to the carbs . This place was super slow but driving on the way here I asked my friend to order me some chicken wings so it took me about 10 minutes to get here and it took them 15 minutes to serve the chicken wings to me? I just won't be coming back here again"}
{"text":"Ok so came here last night for the very first time with a large group... We made reservations for the patio. This place used to be SandBar and it looks so much better. With two large bars inside and outdoors. The vibe here w the live band and entertainers make it a very cool hot spot. Reminds me of Devil's Martini or Barcelona where you can sit, eat and dance the night away. The patio area had a DJ spinning with good music and people dancing. Overall very good vibes. Only issue was with the service. I understand that being a large group, it takes much longer to get our drink and food orders in. But through out the night, it was simpler and MUCH FASTER to just walk up to the bar and order my drink (glass of Pinot Grigio- very difficult to make right?) The place wasn't even that packed. Also, was told they can't do separate checks...   My husband and I shared the caprese salad which was really good!! I ordered a crab stuffed cod ($22) and my husband ordered the short rib stroganoff. Ok for $22 you would expect the food to be a decent portion. It was good. I wasn't blown away or anything by it but it was tasty. Just was very surprised at how small the portion size was. It was the size of an appetizer which came in a small bowl. Luckily I don't eat that much so it was perfect portion size for me but not for my husband. His short rib stroganoff was very small and after he finished it, which by the way was okay (I took a bite to taste), he told me he was still hungry. So for the price, the portion size and the food being good but not worth the price, I give it 3 stars.   Would I come back here? Yes, and would for the night life. To hang out with friends, have a drink, watch the live show and to dance but will probably not be eating here."}
{"text":"Came here for my boyfriends birthday because he is European and I thought he would like the food. The reason why I am giving two stars has nothing todo with the food. The food was just okay.  We didn't have a reservation and showed up at 7. We were told they would take care of us, so we got a drink at the bar. 30 minutes later went to check on status they asked if we had a reservation again then said it would be a little longer. While waiting I went online and booked a reservation then went back to the front and said we had a reservation and they sat us immediately! How comical is that? The place wasn't even that busy, lots of empty tables.  After waiting an hour to be seated we thought everything was good to go but, no. We decided to order everything right away our appetizer and entree's. Another hour later we finally got our food. I was so upset by this time I wasn't even hungry anymore. I feel like I ruined my boyfriends birthday by bringing him here.  They did offer a free dessert for our long wait and acknowledged we had been waiting for so long. By that time we just wanted to leave and never ever come back."}
{"text":"Six of us had a great meal here Sunday night. Service was excellent, the restaurant is large, but is designed in such a way to feel intimate. The patio is very nice, with misters of course. Everyone's food was wonderful so I can recommend: pan seared sea bass, lamb chops, charred spanish octopus, chicken kiev, bucatini pasta and pesto, Mediterranean shrimp, pierogies, beet and goat cheese salad, profiteroles, and mixed berry cobbler. This is a restaurant worth going to again."}
{"text":"Possibly the best dinner I've had since I moved to Scottsdale. The food is just wonderful, from presentation to taste. Also, the service is top shelf. Brad took such amazing care of us! I could not recommend this restaurant more. It's relatively new... Let's make sure it stays!  They do need to do something to boost their presence in Google. It's not appearing on the Maps despite the crazy high ratings."}
{"text":"Short answer - definitely stop in!  Outstanding food drinks atmosphere and service. Reasonably priced. 5 stars.    Stopped in after a workout. Surprised to find the great atmosphere.  Watched the game with beautiful live music behind us.  Kyle served at a high top in the bar.  Eastern European cuisine.  Duck was excellent.  Dutch oven crab stuffed cod super delicious. So many things on the menu I want to try so I'll be back many times.   Atmosphere was outstanding. Not too loud but festive. The place was full with a mixed crowd. One of the owners (Lithuanian family) stopped by to help my duck eating strategy.  Friendly staff.  Contemporary spin on century old cuisine, and FINALLY decent beer offerings.  Try the Weihestephaner Heffe.    All in all a superb addition to the north central Scottsdale offerings.  Don't miss it behind California pizza kitchen off scottsdale road south of Shea."}
{"text":"The review for this restaurant is long overdue. I came here for lunch with a friend back in February and I still remember exactly what we ordered and how good the food tasted. Clearly, it made quite an impact! We got started with a couple of mimosas, which were pretty standard. The first thing that jumped out when we looked at the menu was Kepta Duona. It is bread toasted in duck fat and smothered with havarti cheese. This greasy goodness tasted as good as it sounds. It does fill you up fairly quickly so I would recommend sharing it to make room for all the other delicious food they offer. Being fully satisfied with the over indulgent appetizer, we settled on chicken kotleti for the second round. This dish had even more pizzazz than the first one. Chicken patties cooked to a perfect crisp served over mash potatoes and a mushroom gravy. Every element on the plate worked perfectly well with the other. This might just be one of those dishes you end up ordering every single time at a restaurant you frequent. For the main course, we decided to get the Ruban sandwich with a side of crispy fries. This was pretty good too, albeit, not the best. I'm withholding one star for that reason alone. The fries were stellar and so were the appetizers. The menu has a lot of things I have never tried or even heard of before so I'm intrigued! There's a lot of cool things going for this restaurant including the decor and their service. Check this place out for yourself and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We had dinner Tuesday, 12/6.  We ordered the potato pancakes with duck and the short rib stroganoff.  The food was delicious.  No complaints. Wait staff?  Hmmmm....arrogant, inattentive, our main courses came ten minutes apart without explanation nor apology (this was after being brought the wrong entrees first), distant, plates stayed on the table, why bread plates when there is no bread served?, we were asked had we been to Sonata before and when we said no that was the end of it (why ask? we thought perhaps there would be recommendations, etc.??).  The service ware is very pretty but I like it to be taken away when I am finished - and if there are extra place settings on the table I think that should go too.  Scottsdale is loaded with fantastic restaurants.  Sonata is not cheap and I would expect better service at the price point.  Perhaps it was an off night as I read other reviews that all seem like an enjoyable experience.  I still think the kitchen timing was way off, the management did not do anything about it, the waiter was obnoxious (nicest word that comes to mind), the restaurant was cold.  Also, one thing that drives me nuts but is not unique to Sonata - I DO NOT WATCH TELEVISION AT DINNER AND DO NOT WANT TO SEE TV SETS AT DINNER.  PERIOD.  BTW, I am old but not that old (57).  If I wanted to eat at a bar I would.  We live in McCormick Ranch and enjoy Eastern European food so were excited to try Sonata.  Very much doubt we will again.  First impressions are everything and cold, aloof wait staff and front desk do not make me feel welcome.  I also hate the TV sets that are visible from most tables. Poor service seems to be a trend with new restaurants in Scottsdale - makes me want to stick to tried and true and forget about spending $$ on untried restaurants."}
{"text":"This place has a great ambiance out on the back patio... gas fire pit, heaters during the winter and even a live band! Their happy hour is Monday - Sunday 4pm - 7pm and our server Christine was great! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The owner invited us to try the restaurant again. We took my Mother in Law to try out dinner. The food was great as expected. The service was much better than our previous experience. Everything flowed very well. The server was very polite and very attentive.     The Chef clearly has amazing recipes and the food is spectacular. Although it doesn't make up for the bad service. My Husband finished his entire entree before mine was even cooked. He had to stop the manager because the server didn't even inform him that there was a problem. The manager informed us that they use staggered food service. That should have been something that the server informed us of right from the beginning. We would have ordered something to share so we could enjoy our meal together. I sat and watched as our server was consuming food on the food line while he waited for my husbands food to be ready. He didn't wash his hands before I watched him touch the straw he put into my daughters drink and served it to her. It was a very disappointing experience that overshadowed the great food."}
{"text":"I refrained from writing this review till I visited 4 times.    Visit #1 12/12/16.  We we all not impressed.  It took at least 30 min AFTER we were ready to order, and only because we finally had to flag our server down \"We are ready to order\".   I did not like our server named Eric, because when I was talking to him about the menu he would suddenly say \"let me take care of this bill at the other table\", or \"Oh I have to get this order\", and he would run off.  This happened THREE different times and each time, he did not come back to return his attention to where we left off.  It seemed to ME (cos he acted so), that he was deliberately busied himself with other tables to avoid us.  I ordered the duck that the reviews said melts in your mouth, but it was so dry, I was thinking of sending it back.  It was supposed to be rotisserie, but the leg, wing, and other parts got so dried up that the meat that you are supposed to EAT, was a hard mass, dried up and hard crust, like thick beef jerky.  The manager did offer to substitute it for something else, but he cut the duck all up, to TRY to show me the meat was more tender INSIDE, nearer to the bone.  Well it was a LITTLE better, but still dry.   I eat slow, so my dining companions were already done eating.  For me to substitute another entree when service was already so SLOW), I would have to make my fellow diners at the table, wait and wait, when they were done eating and ready to leave.  I was using $15 for$30 off voucher.  My duck cost $28 so I did not owe any further money.  But I would have been really mad if I had to pay $28 for that dried up duck.  Then it was apparent that we may be there all night and no one would bring our checks.   So I had to flag someone again, our server Eric was told by other servers, but after waiting another 20 min, still no checks, my dining companion told someone else who was not our server (Eric seemed to ignore us all night), that we had waited 20 min.  \"He's getting them ready\".   Finally the checks came.  My eating buddy asked the server \"Why am I being charged $15 for the perogies, when it says on the menu it is $10\".  She was told in the fine print at the bottom, if you want BEEF perogies, it costs $5 extra, which she did not see.  There were only about 5 perogies on her plate, which disappointed her, as well.  We all agreed that the food and service did not live up to the reviews, and we would not eat here again and pay full menu price, unless we were using the $15 off $30 voucher.  First experience so bad, we all got refunds for the multiple vouchers we bought for Sonatas.  Then later, Local Flavor ran a 25% off sale, and Mary and I repurchased Sonata's again, for $11.25 for $30, cos she said she really liked the Perogies.  We were laughing at ourselves for going back.  I WAS going to post the above as a 1 star review for Sonata's, but I wanted to give Sonatas more chances due to seeing other good reviews about service.  Visit #2, I went with a large MeetUp group of 20 people and ordered beef stroganoff.  It  was tasty but the portion was so tiny for the price, beef was size of a stick of butter, and noodles only 1 cup, in a cast iron soup bowl.  But our 2 servers were great, 5 stars.  Visit #3, debated between scallops or filet mignon which server Chris (bartender) told me was 8 oz.  When filet mignon came it was more like 4 oz, which I showed to the manager.  Cook told manager it was only supposed to be 6 oz not 8.  I chose filet over the \"3\" scallops only cos Chris said it was 8 oz.  They offered a me comps that I could not eat (diabetic), so I said 1 sea scallop (worth $10), but cook made me 2.  They were so delicious, I would order this again, but give my server Chris 1 star, cos he did not even bring me silverware to eat it with, he is bartender, not regular server, not used to \"perceiving\", I guess.  Also Chris totally forgot the soup I ordered from HH menu, but later I saw it was not on my bill.  Visit #4 July 11, 2017.  I tried their famous cabbage rolls for first time, finally.  It was $16 when we went last Nov, now $19 for three small 3\" x 2\" rolls on a little mash potatoes.  The meat filling was REALLY REALLY BLAND, like they boiled and boiled the ground meat in a big pot of unsalted water, till any meat flavor was gone and leached out, then strained it and put into cabbage leaves. This time I sat at the bar and was served mostly by the new manager named Bart, whom I met last time cos of the errors that the bartender named Chris (not there today), made.    Not sure I want my last Local Flavor voucher, cos you get so little for your $ even paying sale price $11.25 for $30 to spend.  Like I wouldn't wanna pay $11.25 for $30 tiny 4 oz filet mignon again of anything else I had in the past (duck, short rib, cabbage rolls).    Too little food for too much money, not even worth it when I pay is less than half of the menu price, still have to pay tax and tip (3 x I went, the service was memorably not good)."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Our server was extremely friendly and attentive. Where I think this place fell short was on the saltiness of the food. We ordered 4 different main courses, and 3 of the dishes were very very salty. Dessert was great though. Will give it another try someday to see if I experience the salty food again."}
{"text":"Awful! Very small portions of poorly prepared, the aftertaste in your mouth made it seem like they maybe serving more processed food rather than fresh. Poorly trained waitress. She was clueless about anything on the menu; she had to check on everything. She didn't know what the omelet of the day was because as she put it \"No one ordered it yet\". After going somewhere to get the info what the omelet was what we got turned out to be very different from what she said. I could go into more detail with other examples of her incompetence but I don't have the time. Out of 5 people who ordered 4 different items none of us were pleased with what we got. They ran out of strawberries and had to substitute blackberries in one of the bowls. Needless to say all 5 of us went home and made something to eat. Too many good brunch places to go to in Scottsdale why waste time and money coming to Sonata\"s???"}
{"text":"The aesthetics were great and outside area looked fun. We were first sat at a table that was way too high and made us all feel like children so were moved. The kabab meat was fine but rice was mushy and my wife's salmon was raw in the middle. The manager was nice enough to take it off the bill. The crowd was older so I understand some of the older live tunes.  The place was very understaffed and seemed to have some inexperienced workers which created multiple requests and a long wait time."}
{"text":"Thank you Again Yelp for this GREAT find. I wanted to go somewhere different for Father's Day brunch, somewhere that my family has not been and I found this place.  We had 8 in our party that day and everyone loved it, from the mushroom flatbread appetizer to the Amazing desserts. My Dad is French as I was worried he wouldn't like it but he too loved it all.  Our waiter was awesome and very patient with us making it a fantastic day!"}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance! Fantastic live music - Besame Mucho! And the food - amazing! Loved it! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We had the best experience here! The service was excellent and the food/drink was delicious! We split a couple different things to try and it was all fantastic. We started with the Kepta Duona and it was the best. I already can't wait to go back and order this again. We also had the beet salad, Chicken Kiev, and the cabbage rolls. Everything was really good and we loved the presentation. Our server was also very knowledgable with all of the food and drink. Our drinks were very good and the atmosphere is so nice! The ambiance is very impressive. They did great on the design!!"}
{"text":"Sonata' Restaurant   Modern European or Middle Eastern,  Russian and Ukraine Food.  Live music on the Friday Night with a trio of musicians.   The decor was of ends of wood logs on wall which gives it a unique look, we came here for dinner and it was packed, made a reservation with Open Table.  Very busy, took some time to get served with the appetizer and meal which the waiter apologized about.   Started with the Kepta Duona, which is a Rye Bread soaked in Duck Oil and topped off with Havarti Cheese. I am not a Rye Bread person, but the combo made it work.  Ordered the Chicken Kiev, Dutch Oven Crab Stuffed Cod. The Chicken Kiev is a crispy chicken filled with herb butter and havarti, business mash, charcuterie sauce, wild mushrooms which was pretty tasty. The Dutch Oven Crab Stuffed in Cod was in a pomodoro red sauce, with olives, capes, boursin mash, wilted spinach along with aromatics and herbs with was tender and flavorful.  Sat inside by the open door and someone must have had a medical issue with the smell of Marijuana.  Half way through our meal, the light they had over our table turned off and made it very dark to eat.  Overall the dining experience was pretty good, service was slow, but the food was tasty and different.   Would come back again and try different meals."}
{"text":"Where to begin....called Sonata's at 10:00 AM on Saturday to make reservation for 6:15 PM Saturday evening.  So far, so good - but downhill from there.  At 5:45 PM the restaurant called to say that they were completely booked up and the only seating for two people would be outside (it is the second week in December).  When we arrived at 6:15 there were at least a dozen empty tables inside.  Nevertheless, we sat outside.  Several heaters, but still a little windy and chilly.  Ordered two chicken kiev entrees and split a Caesar salad.  Chicken kiev served on a bed of mashed potatoes.  Potatoes ice cold - sent back.  Ordered dessert with one espresso - espresso ice cold.  Finished our dinner and left about 8:15 PM - still a dozen tables or so completely empty.  Server was adequate but  a little overbearing.  Spent a few minutes with us touting the virtues of another restaurant.    This restaurant is very over-priced (probably due to the entertainer and to recoup the huge cost of renovations).    Too many excellent restaurants in the area to choose from - this is certainly not one of them.  We won't be back."}
