{"text":"Sadly, this hidden gem of a place closed its doors on Oct. 1, 2015. It was easily my favourite Chinese restaurant in SW Calgary and had by far the best and freshest home made pork dumplings in the city. Another family-owned business bites the dust..."}
{"text":"We have been eating here since it opened. Always fresh food, large portions, and tastes great. Much better than hot n fast and without stomach aches. Great curries with the right amount of spice. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We stopped in at this little family restaurant and we were not disappointed ! Even though there was not a lot of people dining (due to nasty cold blizzard), the girl serving us was very friendly and gave us excellent service. We ordered the  Thai dinner for 2 and it fed 3 of us adults.  We did order the fresh Dumplings which they made inhouse and they were the best looking dumplings ever !  Full, fat and soooo tasty !!!  Better than ones I ate in Chinatown  and served piping hot and fresh from the kitchen.  Our meal had sweet and sour pork, fried rice, spring rolls, black pepper chicken and a thai curry chicken dish.  Our food was all hot and quite yummy and we enjoyed our meal here.  They did not have the lunch buffet set out since there were not a lot of customers because of the weather, but we were happy to have the meal special.  We will come back again and definitely try some other dishes, but their Thai food is great! It's nice to support the small family businesses that try hard to serve the communities and this place was enjoyed by us."}
