{"text":"I'm looking past the awkward space and not so nice decor and giving Nu Burger a four stars. 
The service was efficient enough, but it was the food that stood out. The menu is a little bit all over the place but has some fun looking items to try. 
I ordered the So Salmon burger, my bf had Going Burger. They had a ton of different ingredients piled on. To the point where you wonder if you can taste them all. Regardless, my salmon and his Wagyu beef  were cooked perfectly. The buns were soft and fresh and the fries served on the side were fantastic. They are served with a home made ketchup which has a slight marinara flavour to them.
We were more than full after, so I will definitely be back to try some of the kebab corn dogs and buttermilk zucchini fries. . . Or maybe the Asian inspired lobster roll with sushi on top . . ."}
{"text":"I just had a truly terrific meal here; Every thing my wife and I were served was tasty and interesting and the meal was full of unexpected surprises like some of the best fries we've ever had and a killer house-made ketchup. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place a few times.  Never been disappointed, great sushi and burgers.  Only thing is it gets ridiculously warm in there so the last few times, I've just picked up my order to eat at home.

Update - they have now installed blinded which helps keep the place cool.  Another great meal.  This is a nice casual date place, intimate but not stuffy."}
{"text":"Spontaneously tried this place and it is now one of my favorite places for sushi in the city. Great location, worth the $$ and good options for vegetarians as well."}
{"text":"Excellent food reasonable price for food wine expensive. Burger is the second best burger I have had and the the fry's were the best."}
{"text":"THis is my favourite place right now because of the food and the people. Everyone is always friendly and it is clear they are there to make your experience great. Could go on and on about the food. Been here quite a few times. Lunch mates raved about the burgers. They make homemade ketchup - no sugar! And it is delicious. The salmon is always perfect. The stuff of dreams. Must be the marinade they use. The veggie burger is amazing too- even a non vegetarian loved it. The sushi was great too. You will be stuffed and happy if you eat here!"}
{"text":"This impromptu dining experience is my biggest culinary surprise for 2015!

I had spotted Nu when driving by and two months later when I was in the area with a friend we popped in for lunch at 1145a. When arriving we were informed all the tables were booked and we were offered two bar seats. By noon all tables were full with a wait at the door.

The menu made me nervous as every choice is an original combination of western fusion combined with Japanese. I could have sworn I had smoked something new when reading the combination of ingredients. 

We started with the croquettes which with the sauce were substantial with a hint of truffles and shiitake. We then were brought the I NY rolls which were a little large for sushi pieces. Luckily we were able to open our mouths like Jessica James to find an enjoyable, fresh lobster and beef combination. Lastly we had a burger with a high end beef, crispy onions with freshly cut fries. All were excellent and quite the surprise. The portions were huge and prices reasonable. 

While we didn't drink, the wine and beer lists were unique but not long. Most importantly the alcohol selection didn't include the common names of all the chains. 

My only recommendation; make reservations."}
{"text":"I joined my friends on a Tuesday night around 630 and the restaurant was 70% full, it is not a big space with seating for 30-40 max? Interior has a minimalist coffee shop feel with large windows. The menu looked like it catered to a variety of diets so gluten intolent and vegetarians will find mains too. I ordered the Earth Burger with their So Green salad, while my friends dabbled in the Burgushi offerings. While I enjoyed the Earth burger, it was a sweet potato and quinoa patty with a Cajun seasoning, it was a burger that had almost too many things going on at once. Between the tofu pieces, sprouts, pesto, tempura avo, roasted red peppers (& I'm sure I'm missing other fixings), every mouthful differed from the last. Overall, the food was pretty tasty, kinda overwhelming for my personal palette, but what I didn't enjoy was the service. My friends' food came before mine, we waited a good 10 minutes before we could all digged in. I would have rather that our food all come out at once, so I didn't have to awkwardly have to see my friends have their food Luke warm. Also, I was still eating when she gave us our bill (we didn't ask for it yet), I'm sorry, were these tables reserved? Why are you shooing us out? I guess these are minor qualms that gives me the impression that the restaurant didn't properly train its servers or expo. Lastly, perhaps the restaurant should invest in some blinds for the big windows, its not fun eating with the setting sun in your eye and getting sunburnt. I'll give this restaurant another try in the future but I am not rushing back."}
{"text":"I don't usually complain but the service was not great. I arrived on time with my party of 15 to find that my reservation was not in the system. Since my party was large, I did not want to move everyone. No one  apologize for our lost reservation. The host/waitress was kind enough to scramble together a table that was crammed at the end of the restaurant. At most this table would fit 12 comfortably. But we managed to squeeze in after waiting 30 min for the table. 

We ordered food and needless to say, there were a number of items missing - at least half the orders were messed up. Food was not brought out, and items missing from orders. No one ever came by to ask how things were nor did we get refills on any drinks...we were there to celebrate and would have ordered more drinks.  Once we finally got all our food, our dishes were taken away and we were never offered dessert. We were just given our bills. We would have ordered dessert.

 I was less than impressed as this was my birthday dinner. The food was good but the service and organization of the kitchen needs to improve."}

A weekend of eating expired when I went with fellow Eliter's Rita W, Al C, as well as Rita's partner, Ian since this was Rita's idea (I am trying to remember where she heard about it).

Small place, seats 20-30 people. What another reviewer said about the windows needing blinds is true for sure (especially on the 320+ days of sun that we get in Calgary).

Open kitchen, fresh food, local, organic, home-made ketchup, non-GMO vegetables, no Coke or Pepsi products (only the Boylan's cane sugar soda's). They have wine though I did not partake in it's tasting just yet; I forgot to see if they have beers or hard liquor.

Okay, let's get to the food. Upon reading the other 2 reviews and some reviews via Facebook, I opted for the Bento+ had the following:

1 Sky High slider with local grass-fed beef, pork belly, sharp cheddar, each with a unique aioli

1 small portion of red slaw with nappa cabbage, shaved carrots, daikon radish, toasted cashew nuts, beets, cilantro sesame dressing

1 order of french fries or maybe it was the farm fries

4 pieces of their take on the California Roll called Cali Beach (with snow crab, ahi tuna, ocean wise salmon, avocado, pickled beets, pea shoots, wasabi tobiko, crisp ginger; stand alone version is $14 but not sure how many pieces that is) 

More from the menu can be found here: http://nubsb.com/menu

My next Bento+ will be with Russian Roulette (Pacific shrimp tempura, jalapeño-infused cream cheese, cucumber, wasabi tobiko. Served with a shot of sake) or maybe just the roll itself.

We had a great server whose name I forgot despite the fact she kept our drinks (mostly water) from ever going dry. She followed on the quality of the good and made small talk telling us trivial bits about the restaurant.

I have not tried the Burgushi yet or other parts of the menu. Hopefully, Rita W will write of her earth burger experience.

I will definitely be back here. It's only 2.5 blocks from 10th St NW, Memorial Dr. and Kensington if you are walking across the bridge from the Memorial Park.

There is parking in the area that doesn't seem to be too bad depending on time of day.

Trivial: this is only the 3rd restaurant I've ever been to that did not have Coke or Pepsi products; the other 2 being burger joints in Austin.

Note: this would be a nice place to take a date and it's not overtly expensive (I said date, not trick) and maybe more than a t-shirt would be best."}
{"text":"The first time my girlfriend and I went we have phenomenal service, but at that point they didn't have blinds and their restaurant faces east. I spent all of my meal squinting and leaning further and further right to put a close by streetlight in between the sun and I. Aside from that, the food was phenomenal and the service was helpful and kind. 
By our second trip they had installed blinds, so the meal was much more relaxing. What we gained in sun-protection, we lost in customer service. We were served by a different waiter, and one I could only assume was higher up in the chain of command (perhaps even an owner). He talked down to us, raised his voice when asked a simple question and provided no help. When asked how the side serving of fries and the single serving of fries varied in size, he scoffed and walked away. Pretty awkward and tense experience for such a small place. 
If this restaurant could lighten the mood and provide concrete customer service, I would be giving it a five. 
The food itself is wonderful, flavorful and fun. The presentation is impeccable and it draws you in to a beautiful visual performance."}
{"text":"Très bonne surprise! Arrivés là un peu par hasard, j'avais envie de sushis mais on cherchait un endroit qui plairait à mon homme qui lui n'en mange pas. Nous avons trouvé le concept génial, et c'était vraiment excellent!! C'est un endroit où l'on reviendra à coup sur si on repasse par Calgary...et en plus, service très sympa (même si nous n'avons pas eu nos plats vraiment en même temps...) je recommande."}
{"text":"Came here the other week with my friend. 

We enjoyed the environment very much and the customer service was great. Our server was very nice and she helped us with the menu since it was our first time there. 

We enjoyed the concept of burgushi

Found this place online and thought it'd be fun to try. 

Definitely recommend this place. 

Good food, good service.. What more could you ask for."}
{"text":"Burgushi, baby!

Nû Burger Sushi does (you guessed it) burgers, sushi, and everything in between. 

Its fast food meets sushi bar meets lounge. It's a cool and comfortable spot to go for a lunch, dinner or with a group of friends.

Four of us embarked on a journey to eat as many things as we could. These are our stories.

The menu is divided into three, with Burgers on the left, Sushi on the right, and Burgushi, (sushi inspired burgers and burger inspired sushi,) right down the middle.

I don't know why you'd want to choose to miss out on slamming two of the best street foods together, but if you'll not feeling like burgushi, they've got some super creative selections in both the Burger and Sushi worlds.

We tried a Shrimp Po' Boy, a southern classic, this one with a touch of Japanese flare with Tempura Shrimp, Sriracha mayo and pickled onion. Other than that, it's a classic Po' Boy with large, juicy shrimp. Yum

I've just got to see someone order the \"Keep It Down Elvis, You're Drunk\" Burger. Local grass-fed beef, crispy bacon, grilled banana, smooth peanut butter, wasabi aioli and a drizzle of maple syrup. Sounds terrible... yet I'm cautiously optimistic. After such a good experience here, I've no doubt I'll step up and order this next time I'm in. It's also the item on the menu where for an extra $2, it comes with a shot of sake.

In the Burgushi realm, we stuffed our mouth holes with the \"Going Burger\", (local grass-fed beef, shitake mushrooms, sesame grilled tofu, ginger chips, cilantro, teriyaki glaze, crispy onions, wasabi mayo). Awesome! This was one of my favourite for the evening. All the saucy Japanese things on a 6oz beef burger. I was one happy eater.

Next up was the Bánh Mi Fried Chicken. This one threw me for a loop because I was expecting a Banh Mi Fried Chicken Burger, but it's actually a sushi roll. Sure enough, it says so in the description, but this is when we learned that Burgushi can come in both burger form and sushi roll form.  And what' a sushi roll! with togarashi fried chicken, green and red onion, pickled carrot, fresh jalapeño, ciantro, peanut sauce, spicy mayo!

From here it was on to the Sushi side of the menu!

The sushi is creative and very large. You don't need much soy sauce, if any, to dip it in because each roll comes with it's own unique sauces. We tried The One Roll (really did rule them all!), The Russian Roulette (surprisingly happy mashup), The Silk Road, and The Cali Smoke. I won't bother listing what's in everything, but to give you an idea on the creativity, The One Roll is asparagus tempura, Pacific shrimp tempura, snow crab, avocado, cream cheese, topped with sliced scallions and toasted sesame seeds. OH SUSHI!

Bottles of Sake are around $25 a piece, so naturally we ordered three of them to help wash down of tasty meal. 

Pretty sure I'm 15lbs heavier today. Worth it."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom. Sometimes fusion restaurants get it right and this is a super combo. Where else can you and your friend go if you're feeling like a big juicy beef burger and they're feeling like a light sushi dish? 

The place looks sleek and is small, but there weren't many people there at 5:30 on a Thursday so it wasnt an issue.The view is nice with the huge glass walls but everyone was blinded by the evening sun and they don't have blinds. :( 

Anyway the food came decently quick, I had garden Rolls bc I don't eat fish and darnit it was tasty and fresh. I also had some truffle farm fries and they were amazing. Took some leftovers home to my love and he gobbled them down quick. My friend has the jerk chicken burger and enjoyed every moment of it.

I'll go back to try the other things on the really interesting menu. But I'll make sure to find a shady spot if possible!"}
{"text":"Came here for the YYC pizza crawl and was thoroughly impressed.  Having walked by this restaurant on several occasions on our way to the park, we always wondered if this spot was any good.

Well my friends, I'm in. While we ordered the YYC \"pizza\" at NU, everything else about this place look stellar.  Not quite sure how busy this place is normally. We came by on a weekday late evening and it wasn't too busy.  It may be the area unfortunately but who knows.

This place has a great selection of sake if you're into that and eclectic spread of sushi and burgers."}
{"text":"ahh... James C. got to writing his review before I did!  Upon arriving, it was quite easy to find parking near the restaurant, as there is plenty of street parking available. I had trouble finding the entrance to the restaurant though... I neglected to look up :) #shortgirlproblems. I heard about this restaurant browsing through the avenue magazine site, it had a great review, so I was meaning to try this restaurant for a while!

This place is cozy, with LOTS of sunshine through the windows. There was the occasional moments where I felt blinded by the light. I had seen some photos of the food prior to arriving, so I was super excited to try any of their items. I think Al C. could totally read my mind, as he ordered the \"kebab corn dog\"s to start. I absolutely loved the unique taste of the corn dog; it reminded me of vietnamese sausage. Super yummy! I could probably eat 3 full orders of this by myself.

I got a Bento+ as I wanted to sample a bit of everything. I loved the sky high slider, I will be getting a full burger on my next visit for sure. The red slaw was unbelievable. I'm not usually one to eat slaw, but this slaw is a must try! it has a good mix of nappa cabbage, shaved carrots, daikon radish, toasted cashew nuts, beets, cilantro sesame dressing. Trust me. Get it! I got 4 pieces of their \"silk road\" roll. Delicious and fresh, it was an excellent balance to the slider. 

And of course... I had to steal a few bites of the bf's meal. He got the \"Shabang\" Burgushi. We were excited to try this as it was supposed to come with a crisp sushi rice bun. What it actually was though was rice wrapped up in a wrapper to resemble \"buns\". It easily fell apart, but we were happy to eat it with fork and knife as well. The burgushi came with a side of buttermilk zucchini fries, which were delicious when piping hot, but not so good once they got cold. 

Will definitely be back, as I'm drooling just thinking of their \"mac n wow\" and \"croquette bombs\"."}
{"text":"Very interesting menu, this is a burger sushi fusion place.  Had the Bento box (slider with 4 pieces of sushi & fries) for $16. Loved the homemade ketchup, Wasabi aoili, and pork belly in the slider. The sushi (some new take on a california roll with real crab) was interesting but ultimately not memorable. I would like to come back and try other things on the menu, especially the burgushi and mac and cheese."}
