{"text":"I was looking for a vegan personal chef to cater a family event for 25 people.  I called Kristen from Kale Personal Chef Services and I knew after speaking with her for 5 minutes she would be the perfect chef for my event.  Kristen asked important questions about food preferences, allergies and made a personal visit to my home.  She brought delicious samples for us to try.  I was sold immediately and she was very detailed with the menu presentation and service.  I was really impressed with her thoughtful balance/variety of appetizers, entrees and desserts.  She came up with a fabulous menu with plenty of vegan and non vegan choices.  Our guests devoured the food and requested Kristen's business cards for future bookings. Everything was delicious, homemade and healthy.  I highly recommend Kristen for a small dinner party, large event or delivered meals.  I recently hired her again for a birthday dinner party for 8 and it was another, memorable, yummy dinner.  I am so glad to have found her!"}
{"text":"My company tried Kale for daily lunch delivery service and loved it! After a one week trial run, we have decided to continue getting lunch delivered Monday thru Friday. Not everyone at our office eats healthy, all the time. So, we figured it would be nice if our employees ate at least one healthy meal a day. And, a healthy lunch makes for a more productive team! We save a lot of time too, as we no longer have to answer the inevitable daily question in our office \"What do you want for lunch today?\" Now, we know we'll be all eating a lunch made with high quality ingredients that not only tastes great, but is healthy too, everyday! Chef Kristen is very creative and gets even the most unhealthy of eaters to enjoy real food. Highly recommended for small or large companies wishing to save time and increase productivity."}
{"text":"Kristen catered a dinner party for me with 17 guests. The dinner was amazing!! Everything was cooked to perfection. Kristen makes a point to make sure every detail is taken care of. We met ahead of time to go over how we wanted the set up, etc to be and from there she handled everything. She really goes above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect. We had a filet with prawns. The filet and prawns were cooked to perfection. You must try the crab cakes. Guests said they were the best crab cakes they ever had. Many guests asked how I found Kristen because they were so impressed with her. I would highly recommend her."}
