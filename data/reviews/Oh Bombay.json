{"text":"I used to live next to this place for years and for some reason only tried it recently. I was definitely impressed!  The restaurant itself is very small and a bit more of a take out destination than anything. The first time I visited I had the buffet. For $12.99 you get to pick and choose from about 15-20 dishes, with half of them being vegetarian and half meat.  One inconvenience is that if you want a samosa, naan or tandoori chicken you have to ask for it and wait for it to be brought to the table, it's not just up there for you to help yourself to. So of course after a couple orders of these items you feel a bit guilty asking for more. The rest of the buffet dishes themselves are good. I've found the quality of the food to be great, it has the right level of heat and always tastes fresh. The dessert selection is limited to about 3 different items but they do the trick.  I've also ordered take out from here and the value is amazing. For about $6.50 you get your choice of 3 different veg curries, some rice, naan, and a small dessert or can of pop. You really can't go wrong. I would highly recommend this place for cheap, tasty Indian food!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! My fiance and I went there because we were looking for good Indian caterers in the area so we thought we'd try out the food to see if they make the cut. I ordered a plate of channa batura and my fiance did the buffet. When my plate came, I noticed the baturas did not appear like typical baturas. They were flat, dark brown, and saturated in oil. I took a bite and really did not like the taste. So I approached the lady at the counter (who appeared to be the owner) and told her that I did not like the batura, and she replied by saying \"it tastes fine. I had it for lunch, and it tastes fine.\" I was very surprised by the response. Normally when a customer complains about the food, the restaurant would inquire why and offer an alternative. Anyways, I told her that it really wasn't working for me and if I could have something else, but she states \"you've already eaten it, I can't take it back.\" I'm thinking, of course I had eaten it (ONE BITE), which is how I determined I did not like it. I just wanted something else instead, the buffet would have sufficed, but she did not give me any options. Her attitude was very rude and aggressive. She went on to say our taste buds are different and that she liked the baturas. Very very odd interaction.  In regards to food, it was meh. The batura, as you already know was not good. The butter chicken that my fiance had was not good either. The chicken he said tasted like the pre-cut cubes of chicken, in tomato sauce.   Needless to say, we won't be going here again."}
{"text":"Every time I try a new Indian restaurant, I make sure to try their butter chicken.  For $6.50, I got a small bowl (probably around 350mL) and one naan.  Not bad.  However, the price should have been an indicator of things to come.  First taste, \"hm tastes like italian tomato sauce\".  Four half inch cubes of chicken later (chicken didn't even have the standard tandoori marinade, just white chicken), the dish was done.  Mostly tomato sauce.  It's too bad, I had high hopes for this place, mostly because there isn't another Indian restaurant in a 5km radius.  I guess I will have to go further for actual, tasty, Indian food."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning after eating the butter chicken here.  Was not very pleased.  Food was a bit spicy for me and didn't seem super fresh"}
{"text":"The food tastes very good. The problem is that the restaurant is filthy. The washrooms if any sign of the cleanliness of the kitchen are very scary. The food is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Tired the Non-Veg combo. It was very filling would probably go back again. Only downside was it didnt have the heat i was looking for."}
{"text":"If you like spice and you like reasonable priced Indian food then go here, it may not look much but the food is good.  We ordered thali and had the hotter chicken and lamb dishes doubled up and a dhal and paneer veg dish, rice n excellent naan with a can of soda, all this was sufficient for both of us at $8 a piece. The portions are not huge but filling so If you are super sized go for the all you can eat which is better value for money. $13 ...  It's a shame we are out of towners as I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Finally!  Non-veg Indian in upper Oakville! This place opened a few weeks ago in the old Lemon Leaf place.  Very similar to the Winston Churchill location with a not so tired decor.  Non veg thali gets you 2 meat and 1 veg plus rice and naan and pop or dessert for $7.75.  You can't go wrong!  I ordered 1 meat and 2 veg for the same price.  Lamb vindaloo, saag paneer, and the yellow yogurt veg curry was good.  Naan wasn't as fresh as what A1 makes down the street.  Also no option to get whole wheat roti instead of naan.  Service was friendly. Will be back when I want non veg Indian food."}
{"text":"Was looking for a close-by Indian buffet for dinner the other night, and came across Oh Bombay. The cost of the weekend buffet is $14.50 each and comes with unlimited pop, which I feel is reasonable for AYCE. The food was definitely not the best I've ever had, but there was a decent selection of items considering the size of the restaurant. The fresh garlic naan they brought out was amazing (and definitely contributed to that 3rd star)!   Another thing to note is that the lady helping us was extremely friendly. She asked how the food was and if it was too spicy (we said no). All in all, I had a pleasant experience and I may go back again if I am ever craving Indian food and in a hurry. You get what you pay for with this one, so if you aren't on a budget, there are definitely other options in the area with better food."}
{"text":"Ok food. Decent portions. Butter chicken needed more salt and basmati rice was clearly of average quality at best. For the price and portion size I would get take out again if in a pinch. Food was prepared prior to us ordering as it is buffet style. Very friendly service. Probably not a place you want to dine in as it is small."}
{"text":"AS LEE M STATED PREVIOUSLY \"FINALLY!\" Yep a non veg Indian Restaurant right here in Oakville, near my house! Now  Bombay Bhel won't be my sole go to joint to satisfy my curry urges.More Indian restaurants in Oakville means more variety, and variety is the spice of life, spicy food rules, curry is spicy, and i am a logistician and NOW I WILL REVIEW THE CURRY THAT I ATE IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.   The curry was passable. I was however, somewhat underwhelmed with the food. I ordered the spiciest chicken curry dish (forget what it was called) and it was good. It didn't knock me out, or pull me into food nirvana or anything lidat, but it did pass the tastebuds test and was sufficiently tasty. But the naan was not that flavorful. I would have liked more seasoning on it. More butter would do the trick. However, i enjoyed my meal and would definitely come back. I look forward to trying their buffet. I might go here again tomorrow, and get something else. Hopefully they improve so i can upgrade this to a 4, cause Indian food is one of my favorite cuisines, and as such, warrants a high rating. And the service was nice as well. I also enjoyed the aroma of the place, and the Bollywood movie they were showing inside. Those kinda things are always good for ambiance.  THIS PLACE WAS ORIGINALLY A 3 BUT NOW ITS A 4.5. CAUSE THEIR BUFFET WAS AMAZING! AND IT COMES WITH A DRINK!"}
{"text":"It's a wonderful exerience with Indian food.. although we gave them hard time to choose and we were picky for not getting spicy food, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Very good value for money and quality."}
{"text":"Oh Bombay was my first experience with Indian food, and I'm glad I went there. They have a buffet and it's reasonably priced - I've gone back to pick up takeout and got 3 butter chicken meals for about $20.00 (mind you, they are pretty small portions - my Husband and I share the 3rd one).   That being said, I am less than thrilled with their delivery service. I have ordered (or at least have TRIED to order) twice. The first time, I ordered a butter chicken combo and tikka masala combo. It came to about $19 and they told me that wasn't enough, it needed to be $20 for delivery. So I added another pop - then they said $20 wasn't enough, it needed to be $22. Um, what? So I added another butter chicken combo. I got my food and was happy to at least have it.  The 2nd time I tried to order, the woman told us we couldn't order combos, they only delivered large dishes. I mentioned that we had just bought combos the week before and she said, \"Ok, let me call you back.\" Needless to say, she didn't call us back.  Honestly, if there were a closer Indian restaurant that wasn't expensive (Coriander Green is close and delicious, but can cost a lot), I'd order from them instead and never visit Oh Bombay again. But seeing as how they are so cheap and close, I guess we'll be going there for now. Hopefully their delivery service will get better."}
