{"text":"Ordered chicken curry rice and it was tasty and plentiful.   Definitely nice to have variety in this food court."}
{"text":"Omg! I tried their qorma lamb on rice it's amazing!!!! Now it's one of my favorite dish. It has this salty, spicy and sour taste to it. Love it"}
{"text":"Delicious legitimate taste despite being in a food court. Best beef noodles in the food court, the lamb meals are tasty, and the portions are solid for what you pay."}
{"text":"When the owner takes vacation, he closes down his restaurant, so call them before you go. Also, the food  portion is variable depending on who serves you!"}
{"text":"There's always good food to be had at First Markham Place and all this time I have been looking to try Kashmiri BBQ but never got around to it until now.   After perusing the smallish menu I opted for the Masala Lamb Soup noodles at a reasonable price of $5.99 for the regular size. The owner told me to come back in 10 minutes, but I figured good things should come to those who wait.   I was right. What surprised me was the attention to detail in the dish, from the lamb that was stewed until tender to the pulling out of the marrow from the bones and sucking them clean, and the veggies decoratively arranged. This was not expected at a food court!  The noodles, fried garlic, had a little East Asian flair to it and I also tasted some Chinese lettuce at the bottom of the bowl, but I figure this is probably a fusion dish anyhow. All in all a good bowl of East meets South Asia.   Will be back to try the lamb chops and biryani next time."}
{"text":"I've been captivated by this stall for so long, and today I finally mustered the courage to go and try! The owner is super polite and kind - he took the patience and time to explain some of the food and answer my (many) questions. In the end, I settled on the lamb noodle special, which cost $9.99 for a medium. The owner warned me that the spiciness level is quite high, so I chose the mild flavour. He also said the lamb taste would be quite gamey and strong, so I was looking forward to trying it!  After roughly 20 minutes of waiting (I could see them preparing the dish with love, but the preparation process is quite slow so take patience!), the lamb noodles were ready! They were served in the restaurant's personal bowl, so I had to return them when finished. The presentation of the lamb noodles were gorgeous!! A lot of colour and masala.  The masala / spice flavour was quite strong. I could see the cloves, pepper, cumin, and lentils accumulated at the bottom of the dish. There was a massive amount of noodles with a generous portion of lamb. I was actually quite disappointed that the lamb flavour and taste wasn't very strong - there was no gaminess whatsoever and it just tasted like normal beef brisket. That was quite unfortunate. The noodles, however, were delicious and al dente! By the end, I was so stuffed, and there was still a lot left near the end.   Look forward to some home style prepared Kashmiri food, but be patient! Moreover, the food is on the pricier side in the food court, but it's definitely an interesting addition to the various Asian options."}
{"text":"First Markham Place never seems to disappoint. For anyone working in Markham, this food court is great for your wallet. Even better for your tummy!  Now I have tried all types of Indian food, Pakistani , Bengali, Tamil, Punjabi, South Indian..so forth and so forth.. but KASHMIRI!! thank you , something new.  Let me say, i was surprised at the amount of selection that they have, even though their menu is kind of hard to decrypt (print out with picture taped all over the place) . I ordered the basic daily special. Chicken Biryani with a pop for $5.99.  Was really good. Nice white meat, with a flavour of biryani not like anything else in the area. Not overwhelming with spices but still had great flavour. I enjoyed it for the price.   It was my first time so i went basic, I am definitely ready to visit the world of Kashmir again. good STUFF!"}
{"text":"Having eaten here twice, as its relatively new compared to the other restaurants in the FMP foodcourt, it has quickly become one of go-to's if I ever feel like foodcourt food.  Owner is super nice, always accommodating spice levels, so you can choose mild or super spicy like I do. He even gives extra sauce in case it wasnt spicy enough.  It is an acquired taste, so some may find their chicken to be dry, but I personally enjoy this barbeque style as much as I love tender chicken. Will be back to try the kashmiri indian curries. Cheap as well."}
{"text":"So today I decided to finally order something from Masala Mahal when my friends recommended we come to FMP for lunch. Since Masala Mahal is located in the FMP food court, I will not have any comments to the venue.   So I ordered a BBQ chicken with naan and salad. The owner said will take 15 mins as the BBQ chicken needs prep time. So I waited, and after 20+ mins, the food was ready. The chicken was very well marinated and cooked nicely. The spice was coated perfectly and flavour was just right. The naan was a bit cold, so it became a bit more chewy than normal but still tasted good. I have never had Kashmiri food before so this was an eye opener. I am definitely gonna hit this place up again."}
{"text":"This place is spectacular if you want authentic tasting kashmiri food. I ordered their version of roasted chunky beef soup with noodles, medium spicy, and man, does the richly balanced aroma of flavors and spices blow me away!   They've  improved a lot since they first opening in the summer. Noodles went from thin rice noodles to a medium thickness noodle, beef went from somewhat bland to richly flavored and the soup base is the perfect balance of spices and salt.  Portions are more than generous and for 7 bucks it comes with a drink! Truly another hidden gem."}
{"text":"I called during a weekday to check on their business hours but no one picked up the phone. So I decided to go there and found the place closed. It is located in the food court of a mall and I was really surprised to find this place closed when all other fast food vendors were open. From this you may draw your own conclusion."}
{"text":"Ordered a rice at medium spicy.  Forgot the name.  It is item #1 on the hand written board.  Really good. Medium spicy is the perfect \"foreigner spicy\".  On top of spiciness, there is bold and unmistakable spices in this rice.  The meat part is mediocre.  Meat is not the star. The super star of this rice dish is the rice.  I would gladly eat it without any meat."}
{"text":"Extremely delicious dishes served in decent sized portions. Owner is very nice too. Must try!!"}
{"text":"Kashmiri BBQ took over what was Shanghai Legend in the First Markham Place food court. I was a little taken aback when I saw it, cause Shanghai Legend was still operating last weekend. This place is so new that it doesn't even have a sign up yet!  There are several items on the menu I wanted to try, but I mainly focused on the skewers they have. I tried the lamb skewers. For $2.50 each skewer, the price is actually quite steep compared to other places I know. It tasted pretty good, however I've had better skewers during Night It Up (PS: Kashmiri BBQ does have a stall there), and honestly $2.50 for a single skewer is too expensive for the quantity it offers, especially considering it's still technically fast food.  Nonetheless, it's a welcome addition to the First Markham Place food court. With the halal vendor now, the food court now has stalls for Western style Chinese, HK style Chinese, Central Chinese, Northern Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Korean, Halal, BBQ, and bubble tea. Not bad in terms of variety!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed.. probably wouldn't return..  Place looks and feels very authentic..  Was interested in trying their lamb..  Glanced at the menu.. decided to get their lamb chops with basmati rice.. $11.99  I also wanted their veggie biranyi! The menu price was $8.95.. she agreed to combo it for $20.. so $1 off.. no drink.. sure...  It looked great out of the box.. lamb chops were about 1 cm thick.. so 3 lamb chops and plain rice for $11.99 is not a good deal..  Lamb chops tastes great! They were braised, instead of grilled (the picture was grilled). Had a nice masala flavour to it.. and it was fatty, so it came across delicious!  The biryani rice was a complete fail for me.. I'm pretty sure she used to canned or frozen Veggies.. so came with diced carrots, corn, peas, and green beans.. for $8.95 that is a complete rip off!   Overall the masala flavour is definitely there in full effect! But other then that it, it's a fail..  Wouldn't return, therefore 2 stars"}
{"text":"Hidden GEM!!  The best shank curry ever and the Haleem is quite flavoursome  although could be thicker.  But thats pretty much where it ends. The biryani is bad.   Restaurant prices at the food court  The owner is a very nice guy to talk to overcharged us but later admitted the error with refund."}
{"text":"Lamb biryani and lamb kebabs were delicious and taste authentic.  You will experience cardamom, cumin, and rich spices in every bite.   Price and portion doesn't quite balance out yet but this is something they can fix with a bit of customer feedback (sometimes they give too much food for an order, and other times it seems they give too little).  Hope they last long because it seems they might close up if they don't start investing into some quality billboards.  Too easy to walk by them and not give this place a chance because their storefront advertising efforts are negligible."}
{"text":"The opening of Kashmiri BBQ does make the food court of First Markham Place more diversified!  Lamb with Rice? It is kind of like a fried rice? It has a good seasoning of cumin and chucks of lamb pieces.  Locating inside FMP competing against so many other fast food option is not going to be easy. If Kashmiri BBQ wants to attract more customers, they really needs to be more aggressive price and quality wise. But serving Halal food might give them an edge over the other food stalls inside FMP."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came here for briyani and wow, was it ever delicious. Masala Mahal has lots of daily specials where you can get a fully loaded box of beef/chicken briyani and a pop for $10 flat. The flavours are soooo good even my Indian coworkers (who are more exposed to the cuisine) comment on how delicious the food is.   The owner is super nice but I recommend calling to order ahead as they can get quite busy during lunch."}
{"text":"Food was great. Ordered the large lamb shank and it was delicious falls off the bone goodness. Owner is really nice and gave me a lot of suggestions to choose from. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I had skimmed over a few reviews before deciding that this was where I'd go for lunch. I believe the difference between a medium and large order was getting 2 naan instead of 1. When we first dug into the naan it was warm and soft but as we continued in our meal I could tell that the edges were hard. The amount of food on the plate is was too much for just myself. I suppose if you have a good appetite it would be a good portion for you. I'll admit that I don't have butter chicken all that often but I was surprised when I got my order. It's definitely different from what I've had before. It was good but not what I was expecting."}
