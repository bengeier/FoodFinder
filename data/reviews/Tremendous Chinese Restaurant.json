{"text":"Good for cheap dim sum in the afternoon throughout the week.
Also recommended for late night eats after clubbing.
Many people say that they've found pieces of plastic in their food or mice running around but I've never seen it for myself. I'd still go back."}
{"text":"One of my fave dim sum restaurants because of its free parking and cheap dimsum. $2.20-$2.60 a dish depending on when and how you are paying (card vs cash). They do not take debit though they do have an ATM.  Service isn't the greatest, I do not like the dirty looks I get from that old man and the lady servers. But all the ladies who push the carts are very helpful and nice. All in all I would recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Ah the good old Tremendous. The spot back in the days after clubbing. Deep fried spicy squid, har gow, siu mai, garlic chicken fried rice and fun gow are my usuals. The service here sucks but it's open late which is hard to come by in Mississauga. It's relatively cheap and the portions are huge. The food is prepared very quickly and it's a good no-frills place. Beware though the crowds late in the night can be difficult. I've had my share of experiences at Tremendous which has most likely led to my declining visits to this place although I live extremely close by. Had someone hit and run the car once there and another incident of someone keying the entire car too. Two separate incidents so beware late night the actions of stupid drunk patrons."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for as long as I can remember. Amazing food! Open late! Friendly staff. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Chinese place because it is authentic and not overpriced, but beware that I've noticed that white people get treated differently. The dim sum is definitely their specialty and they serve it only at lunch with carts, but you can order it at dinner."}
{"text":"I'm a regular. I'm not ashamed. In fact, I've been eating here since before high school when my dad would take me to sneak in some fried chicken in our stomaches before having to eat something healthy my mom made at home. I still come here whenever I'm craving Chinese food. I feel guilty when I spend $20 on Har Gow and Chow Mein at Spring Rolls when I can get Chicken Chow Mein, Shrimp Rolls, Har Gow and Shumai for under $30. I will eat here forever. Why? Because I know what to expect - food! Also, they know my face, I've brought so many different people here and they're nice to me and the food is quick when I'm hungry!"}
{"text":"Very authentic dim sum place open till 4am!  Very very crowded after 10-11pm every night."}
{"text":"please don't come here thinking you're going to get this lavish authentic Chinese meal. 

nope, you'll get layers and layers of plastic table clothes, paper napkins and waiters in hot pink vests. 

with that in mind, it's a great place to come in and get good old greasy spoon Chinese dim sum. whether its 9am or 9pm you'll get a good selection of food. it's open super late and after 11am on weekends you get the old ladies pushing around those old school dim sum carts. 

I love it here because it's cheap eats and it's busy enough that you know there is a quick turnaround in food so you get fresh veggies and meat - at a very very affordable price! and the waiters mean business - no small talk - their main objective is to get you in, fed you, then get you out! 

great place to hit up after a night at the karaoke bar or \"da club\""}
{"text":"It is legit chinese food for me I've eaten chinese cuisine in Shanghai China and Hongkong so I can say it is very good. For the price we payed I couldnt ask for more. I'm a satisfied customer. It lacks one star because it is not a clean place but regular chinese restos are like that."}
{"text":"This place has the greatest deep fried spicy shrimp hargaw and excellent calamari! It is fast friendly and delicious. Great for post club/bar and birthdays too. Their sezchewan Chicken is very good too. 4 stars because they don't deliver... everything else is great."}
{"text":"Very good dimsum place. Staff is very friendly, will be my new dimsum place here onwards!"}
{"text":"Used to be a great place to go, but really has gone downhill in the last year or two. Very reasonably priced at $2.40 cash/2.60 credit per dish, but they also used very cheap and probably expired ingredients. Luncheon meat used in the shaomai. Pregnant and had food poisoning for about a week. Very scary! Most likely from the beef or some sort of meat. Even though selection is minimal, food should be clean, fresh and safe to eat!"}
{"text":"ok.  as a very picky food eater I have to tell you this place is GOOD.  it is  not very $$$ and the portions are decent and the food is good - it is very hard to find good chinese food.  The service is so-so if you have a female server - the men are better.  the parking sucks - there isn't any and it is a weird parking lot - but go just once I guarantee you that you will be back.  It looks like a dive - don't be fooled food is great."}
{"text":"Excellent late night Chinese food. Crab corn soup, excellent. Stay away from breaded deep fried stuff, too much dough. Amazing rice and noodle dishes. Very fast service and great prices."}
{"text":"A favorite of mine when it comes Chinese cuisine. This place is the kind of place where a group of people can go and enjoy dishes that range from traditional to authentic. Always a great time. And super reasonable too!"}
{"text":"I've ordered at this restaurant, maybe 4 times, and I've always ordered the Genera Tao. The first two times it was very good: Fresh General Tao with a slight crisp to it.  The last couple times fell off. Especially this last time.  The general Tao did not taste fresh and the chicken was hard and chewy.  If I lived closer, I would have brought it back (pick up order). I wonder if it's because it was a pick up order that I did not get a fresh batch. Really disappointing.  This post is mainly based on my last experience here as it's so fresh on my mind."}
{"text":"Called at 3am for takeout for first time. Communication was getting frustrating. They don't speak English. Expected the worse when picking up food. To my surprise. Order was perfect. Price was right. The food was absolutely amazing. Highly recommend this place. The recipes were great. The portions were great. Will go back. Very very very happy with tremendous. By far one of GTAs top chinese food joints."}
{"text":"Food was OK. 24 hours is nice. Parking lot sucks. 

Bill was like $47.50, gave $50 in cash and waited for change. Had more money to give as a tip, but was going to get the change back first and leave on the table. Guy comes over and rudely says \"tip is 15%\" and stands and waits. 

Yeah bud, your tip was going to be 15%, but not anymore. Won't go back, you're not entitled to anything and surely not when you're rude about it. Judging from the other comments, this isn't a rare occurance"}
{"text":"A lot of low reviews here but I'm giving this place a 4 star only because its the only place where you can get dim sum at 1am that doesnt taste any different from most other dim sum places. As an Asian I of course ordered the OG chinese items. Shu mai, ha gow(also tried the deep fried one), pheonix feet(no idea how to spell it the right way), beef chow fun, and congee.  Everything was average except for the congee, I didnt enjoy it as much.  The beef chow fun is also different from most other places. they use a thinner noodles vs. the big square noodles that I like. The deep fried ha gow was good and had a little spice to it.  Each time i've gone i've had great service from one specific waiter that i seem to get everytime.  My standard of customer service is that he brings our food, brings a check and refills my water when its empty and he did just that so i have no complaints. I cant speak for the other dishes but if you're looking to get just dim sum late at night its not a bad place.  I wouldn't come here to get authentic chinese food if it was any other time of day."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. I come here a bit because it's the only place close by that offers late dim sum and is opened even later. 
The service is that of most typical Chinese restaurants. 
Would I come back? Definitely! But if lets say, another late night dim sum place opened up around Mississauga, I'd probably head there."}
{"text":"We used to love this place unfortunately that's not the case anymore...quality has gone down hill. It seems portions are smaller!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place about a dozen times over the course of my residency in Mississauga. I have to say that this place is one of those places you only go to if you really have to. After clubbing, late night munchies that sort of thing. The food I truely believe is pre-cooked and they just warm it up and give it to you. The servers are the worst part. They just stand around looking at you which I guess is good if you need them they come right away but it's super creepy that they watch you eat. 
A while ago I went with my friend and we ordered a lot of food and thought no worries we will eat the rest for dinner. The server was like \"Are you serious? You guys really want to order this much?\" And chuckled as he walked away. Super embarrassing but whatever. 
The food that came wasn't hot and we felt awkward with the 5 6 servers just watching us.

Another time that I went they brought our food really late and we ended up taking a couple bites and asking for a container to go. When we went to pay my boyfriend at the time tipped the guy accidentally $0.01. Mind you this is the guy who is sitting behind the bar who did not do anything to deserve a tip even if we wanted to give one.
Once he saw the amount he raised his voice and was like next time don't tip me at all. He was then explained to that it was a mistake and we weren't even giving a tip and honestly he started getting so angry. I was like why are you even working at a place where you depend on your tips to get by? Get another job. Like seriously I only tip when I feel it's deserved- And it wasn't. 
I try to avoid this place as much as possible but shit happens and on random random nights you end up there some how."}
{"text":"Came here around 1am after discovering the Burrito Boyz at Hurontario and Dundas was closed late Thursday night. This was my second visit to Tremendous. They earn 4 stars for: late hours, quick service, food comes piping hot, decent prices. Waiters are dressed in bowtie uniforms which I find funny. They may not be the kindest, but give them a break (they're working the night shift)! 

Ordered the chicken fried rice ($7.95). It came tossed in soy-sauce hence the brown colour. I reccomend spending a few extra $$$ and opting for the House Special fried rice which looks more yellow in color, and comes loaded with seafood. Looked delicious as the table next to me orderd it. Ocassionally, you will hear loud sizzling noises. The menu has different types of sizzling meat dishes which come on a hot plate with onions and the meat on top. It stays piping hot throughout your meal!

Overall, a great late night spot in Sauga you can rely on. Check it out when you get those drunk munchies."}
{"text":"For a typical dim sum Chinese restaurant, this place is quite good. What I love is that you can get dim sum all day! Bring it on!

We love dining here with friends. Large tables that can host large parties. The food is excellent for the most part. Some dishes we enjoyed are actually off the menu. They will make almost anything you ask. 

We ordered a host of items including pan fried snow pea leaves with garlic sauce. Always a great dish to counter all the meat... Lol! Also some dishes for the first time like the deep fried har gao with chilli pepper. Holy crap it was good. Equally fantastic was the deep fried soft shell crab. A must at this place. 

The restaurant itself is showing its age, but man, I can overlook the decor for good food. It's always a good time dining with other families and this place was perfect for our group."}
{"text":"Tremendous is one of my favourite late night go-to spots in Mississauga; especially when I'm craving Dim Sum at 2am in the morning. The other reviews have covered most of what I wanted to say already so I'll just list my favourite dishes:

-Beef Ribs
-Beef Sizzling Plate with Steam Rice
-Beef Tripe
-Chicken Feet
-Fried Chicken with Steam Rice
-Pork Buns
-Pork Spring Rolls"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for years but only recently have my parents and I started eating here. Hope in the wall place located in an industrial area. Don't expect clean conditions and opulent interior. Dim sum is passable but not the greatest. But as they charge a flat rate that is way cheaper than other dim sum places, you can't really complain. 

For dim sum I would recommend their rice bowl with chicken and mushroom or with preserved meat. Their deep fried shrimp dumplings are good too. 

Overall a half decent place for cheap."}
{"text":"Great food and just a priceless night life in there. Anybody from police to strange dates. I love coming here for the food and the people"}
{"text":"Biggest piece of advice would be to go for lunch instead of dinner if you're getting dim sum. Their weekday lunch menu is exactly the same as dinner but everything is 50% off. Our table ordered har gow (shrimp dumplings), shiu mai (pork dumplings), BBQ pork bun, fried chicken, fried squid tentacles, and fried rice. Consensus was that everything was thoroughly average and nothing special, especially the dumplings, which were not great. Squid tentacles get a stood out as a great dish compared to the rest.

Service was really bad, even more so than what you expect from a lot of Chinese restaurants. Waiter was blunt and rude at times. Food came out pretty quickly which was a plus. Overall, experience was kind of disappointing because I had high expectations based on what friends have told me. I'll probably give it another try but during lunch time because price is a big part of what they're known for."}
{"text":"It's been 10 years since I have eaten from here. The last time I walked through the door I didn't  even get to eat becase I was greeted at the door by a conditional pass sign.!!I reversed and walked out... coming back I am amazed at first the green pass. As well the food taste even more amazing, air more clean and bright... service amazing..... I'm so happy I can go back and enjoy great late night food.."}
{"text":"I've been going to Tremendous for over 10 years now and I love going here on the weekends for dim sum... its always busy during lunch time but its worth it because you see some of the employees wheeling around dim sum carts and you get to select the dishes that you want."}
{"text":"I've been going to tremendous for a couple of years now. They're known for their cheap rates and long hours of dim sum service! The variety isn't as good as places like Emerald but for me, the taste of what they offer is the same. If you pay in cash, you can get a discounted price (I think it's without tax)."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, horrible tax evaders.

We went there as a team from work to eat and as usual I paid for the bill expecting to me reimbursed from my company. However, the restaurant refused to take debit and told me I'll have to pay cash withdrawn from THEIR ATM machine. I did so and in return they gave me a fake little blue ticket and wrote \"$70\" on it. This is not a proper receipt and I can no longer be reimbursed for the money I've spent here. 

They did this for tax evasion purposes whenever customers pay cash. I will be reporting them."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots for decent Chinese food. The dim sum is great. My daughter tried the congee and she loved it. I love their sliced pork with vegetables. The price very economical and very good service."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmm never disappoints fried rice and beef with black bean sauce is the BEST , pretty much anything from here you can't go wrong with."}
{"text":"If you live in the Peel Region and are looking for a great place to eat late at night, Tremendous is usually one of my Top 3 place to go. It's better known for its \"tremendous\" food portions and late hours. And I emphasize on the late hours because they are open until 4am every day, which is basically the hotspot for late night grubbin and even after clubbing.

Food wise, it always tastes amazing. I've always heard that joke \"if a chinese place has waiters that treat you like shit and has broken furniture, you know the food is going to be good\", and I would say that would be somewhat true. Although over the years that staff has gotten more friendly (years ago, i got a menu thrown at me, doesn't happen anymore but I still love the place) andthe decor is somewhat lacking, the food is always on point.

My usual go to's are Yin Yang Friend Rice (Chicken tomato sauce on one side and Creamy egg sauce on the other over a huge plate of Fried Rice), Beef Chow Mein, Har Gow, Siu Mai, Fried Squid.

A couple of tips when coming here, they won't split the bill for you and its recommended you bring cash (no debit, but I think they do credit)

Overall, I love coming to this place, there are times where I just crave their food and go late at night with a couple of friends and hang out."}
{"text":"TREMENDOUS DISAPPOINTMENT....That is EXACTLY what this dump should be called!!! In a crappy industrial area it looked strange from the start.  We should have backed the car out and gone ANYWHERE else.

Sat down and got some warm \"tea\". Brutal. Ordered curry chicken on rice and shrimp balls at first. Took 20 MINUTES to get it!!! We were STARVING and there was maybe 2 tables that were already served!! 

Curry chicken and rice should be called onions and rice because there was about 10 small pieces of chicken with a whole onions cut up on rice. The shrimp balls weren't too bad but I've had better. 

The service is NON-EXISTENT.  Forget getting your tea refilled or making another order or asking for ANYTHING because they don't care. They aren't waiting to serve, they're waiting for you to get out and PAY.

OH, forgot to mention. A couple Chinese old broads cutting up vegetables on a table in plain sight. Classy. 

Time to leave. Waiter not interested. Had leftovers. Grabbed a box and slid the food in then asked for a bag and the bill. It was exactly $35. We paid EXACTLY $35 and walked right out the door. 

All in all I'm a chinese food lover and this place is just horrible. We will never return even if there's nothing to eat anywhere. To the waiters....WE OWE YOU NOTHING FOR DOING NOTHING. BE HAPPY WE EVEN PAID."}
{"text":"Fresh dim sum (order off a menu) great prices...  really what else is there to say?

The staff the speak english are pleasant enough, if you expecting 5 star service, you've ventured into the wrong restaurant.

The boys and I from work do a weekly pilgrimage to the restaurant from our Oakville office. Never disappointed. Can't beat the value."}
{"text":"Great dim sum.  I've been going to this restaurant since I was a kid and the familiar flavours take me back to another time. Had the opportunity to stop in the other day and everything was on point. Service was prompt and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I've been a customer for 5-6 years they fell off! They don't make the General Tao good anymore ! Too dry! They always give me attitude and I stopped going there! I used to go quite often ! But overly priced and not good enough for me anymore."}
{"text":"This is the best dim sum place in Mississauga bar none.  Food prices are great and staff are consistently okay.  It is strictly a cost benefit assessment.  Bring cash for payment for discount.  Free WiFi!"}
{"text":"I find it hilarious how mirrored our city is-

2 restaurants in 2 different ends of the city that offer 24 hrs dim sum and Chinese food. 

Perfects Restaurant in Scarborough Versus Tremendous Restaurant in Mississauga

Do these places offer the best Chinese food in the world. Heck No. However when you are intoxicated and make life decisions where you need food at 4 am in the morning which isnt McDonalds.- Its delicious and heaven sent!!"}
{"text":"Great Dim Sum for cheap prices.  Open late and the food is consistent.  The service is what you would expect from a Chinese Restaurant so you can always tip accordingly.

The food is quick, consistent, and tastes great every time.  They recently renovated and it is super busy whenever I go during Saturday or Sunday afternoons for a hangover cure.  However, even if you have to wait... the wait is not long at all.

Overall, go here if you want decent and CHEAP Dim Sum at any and all hours."}
{"text":"10 years ago, Tremendous used to be our go to place for cheap dimsum and late night snack. I used to lover this place and come on a weekly basis. Over the years I felt the food quality and service went down so much. Parents in laws invited us to join them for dimsum past weekend. It was a disaster. Dimsum cart came out slow, varieties are very limited. We ordered from the menu, took forever to wait for the food come out. Certain stuff we order they were sold out, we were not being told till the very end when we ask where's the rest of the food. Horrible experience. I don't think I will come here again!"}
{"text":"This place is dead ass scary as hell but man is it good. If you dont mind eating in an industrial park next to an illegal gambling parlour, or perhaps because of that this is your jam. It's pretty standard western Chinese food but done right. Best bet is to go drunk or after having some jazz cigarettes, it's a little too ruckus to enjoy if you're a square."}
{"text":"I love the food here. I know it's known as the after clubbing go to restaurant but it's honestly so much more than that. That restaurant is packed no matter what time of day it is and that shows a clientele that loves the food. I've gotten everything from dim sum to chicken balls. By far the have the best bean sprout noodles I've ever had - keep in mind a restaurant that has accomplished and mastered the feat of the simplest dishes - imagine their more complex dishes. 

The service is a little slow taking your order because of the large amount of people always cashing out however cooking the food and bringing it to us was always very fast. The portions are amazing and I really like the atmosphere. It feels a little bit family style with all the large tables.

I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I visited this place three or four times already. The food was ok. It tastes good but mostly they put more vegetables or onions than the meat. Typical Chinese restaurant. 

My recent visit was not so good because of the customer service. It was terrible. We went there late at night just because all the other restaurants were closed already. The waiter serving us was not very welcoming and just staring at us while we're eating. So creepy. Then we ordered some more food for take out for my grandparents and the waiter's face looked like he was wondering why we ordered more.

When we payed the bill and about to leave our table, the waiter went back to us and he demanded that the tipping should be 10%. Wow, I never heard anything like that before because all I know is tipping is optional and only if you deserve it. We left the restaurant pissed off and I don't feel like going back there because customer service for me is next to food quality."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. First of all, service is non existent. Restaurant is dirty. You will wait a long time to get drinks besides the tea and put your order in. And they won't ever come back around until you grab someone to get a check. The food was ok but nothing to go back for. They walk around with dim sum, soup, and other sides to add to your table but it's all cold because they just keep circling the restaurant with it. My final straw was the check. They charge a seating fee per person at your table. I think a $1.50 for two people. There is also a server charge when the servers are pointless. These aren't high amounts but I find them ridiculous. My husband and I had two entries and a plate of fried rice and our bill was over $45 on food, it wasn't like we were only spending $10 and charging it. But after flagging down someone we got a bill, and then when he saw we were paying by card, he brought another higher price bill because of paying by card. It's this business practice that will keep me from ever returning. I'm a small business owner and I know what the charges of credit cards are but when you add all these extra charges for sitting in your restaurant and for their horrible services it's just even more insulting to your customers. Greed will lose you customers!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, but great, consistently reliable and affordable dim sum.  Service, meh, but in my experience, if you go to a Chinese restaurant in the GTA and expect anything above disinterested or downright surly, you're in for a world of hurt.

Very busy by 11am, so get there beforehand if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"would only eat here late night; they are open till 4am what more can you ask for after a late night out, quick and fresh Chinese food!? Always fresh when you go, service could be better but what more can you really ask??!"}
{"text":"The food is average. The sticky rice does not have enough fillings, that I actually prefer the sticky rice they sell at Yuan Ming or Btrust supermarket.  The shrimp wonton and shrimp sticks are comparable to those I buy at oceans supermarket, but at oceans, it's double the quantity and less price. I do enjoy the food carts coming around, but I noticed a lot of the dim sum items did not come out, for example, the fried taro.  I enjoyed the spareribs with rice.

Service was pretty good. They are quick to respond when you call for a waiter, so long as there is one around.  The ladies pushing the carts actually speak English which is a definite plus in determining what the dim sum item is made of.

Despite the service and novelty of the good carts, the food just does not warrant a dining out event.  As mentioned, some of the items offered I would have preferred to purchase at an Asian supermarket."}
{"text":"We love coming here. All day and all night dimsum.  Service is always great! They open until like 5am.  This place has been open since my clubbing days 20 years ago.  So glad this place is still around!"}
{"text":"I must have been here three dozen times.  That should tell you a lot of how I feel about this place.

Food: A (not by Markham standards, but by Mississauga standards)
          I can't say too much about regular food as I did not have too many dishes, but dim sum 
          is legit, tasty most of the times)


Service: B (Owner is frowning most of the time, but lets not be hard on him.  Maybe he has gas)

Decor: B+ (not bad for Chinese place, brightly lit)

Price: V  (very dang good, inexpensive as heck, cash price is good value)

Overall: A-     How can you not love a place like this, where they are open from 9am to 4am to
                      serve the customers.   This is one of Mississauga's hidden gem.  For those who 
                      are not thrilled with their food, please remember we are in Mississauga.  Maybe
                      someday, we will be a Mecca of Chinese Cuisine in Canada, like Markham.  Until
                      then, let us appreciate this place, and hope they never go out of business."}
{"text":"the dimsum was ok, but the service was not. The server took our order and immediately brought us out our dimsum (dont know if its already prepared or even fresh). after our meal, we went to pay, and the lady asked us where is her tip? I told her we left it on our table, but she  said \"we lie\" I know right, a waitress actually say we lie. so i went back to our table and took back our tip and never return again."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Tremendous because it provides another satisfying late-night option in Mississauga. 

After being here nearly a hundred times, I can confirm that what all the other reviews are saying is true. I just wanted to add by listing a few of the dishes that I feel Tremendous excels at:

Hot and Sour Soup
Deep Fried Spicy Squid
Black Pepper Beef
Salted Chicken and Fish Fried Rice

I would be satisfied with that same meal every time."}
{"text":"My new most hated restaurant. 

Tonight I had the driest chicken imaginable. I admit I'm not the greatest cook myself, but if I ever made that chicken at home, I'd throw it out right away and make something else for dinner. Absolutely disgusting. I am stunned."}
{"text":"Was here recently for some pre-concert Dim Sum.
It was pretty good -- no complaints at all, but it also doesn't live up to its name.

If anything though, you've gotta come here for the people-watching.  Mississauga is absolutely world-class in its diversity, and this place will remind you of that."}
{"text":"So the only times i have ever ate here is when i was full of the devil juice hahah and i ALWAYS get lemon chicken and fried rice! now i have mixed in other things from other people but the lemon chicken here is actually unreal. I have attempted to order it in many many other restaurants downtown and even in mississauga and still none take the cake for that dish like this place. the decor is hideous. The tables are covered with what looks like ripped white garbage bags layered on top of each other, but the reason for that is because of the swarm of people they get after the late night clubers are drunk and hungry and they have to quickly clean the table (this is no excuse to have regular table tops though lol) its busiest around 2-4am where you see everyone you just left the club because of haha either way its a good spot for groups to sit at the 8-10 seater tables and have a god laugh about your night have some good grub and go home"}
{"text":"Really good food. Pork shiu Mai's the bomb. Nice curry dishes. Everything is good. Only thing is no website or easy online menu, get with the times. But I order here all the time."}
{"text":"Good food, fair prices.  Authentic Chinese food is everywhere these days in Toronto.  To keep my business they need to up the standards."}
{"text":"Been eating here for about 17 years and the food is now only half as good as it used to be. ill still go on a sunday to catch some dim sum! stay away from the general tsao, it sucks."}
{"text":"Here is probably the best way to describe Tremendous Chinese Restaurant 

Service: 1/5 - If service is what your looking for.. Go back into your car and drive down the street to McDonalds. The team is not very friendly the manager is extremely rude. So don't look for service here. 

Quality of Food: 3/5 - There food is good, certain items only. DO NOT GET any of their apps because first they are not worth your money and they cheap out on all the ingredients. Rated 3 because of their app. The food is not too bad 

Temperature of Food: 5/5 - Food was prepared and packages appropriately. 

Value of Meals: 2/5 - The price of food is a bit high for a lower end Chinese restaurant. I ordered a rice plate, general Tao's chicken and as an app Deep Fried Wong Ton. $32.00

Atmosphere: A place for a quick bite to eat. Either late night or during the day, but it gets busy during weekends (People coming back from bars and clubs). Very casual dinning. Washroom is extremely dirty. 

Would I Return: No

Time of Meal: Dinner takeout."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite Chinese places to eat. Price was good and the was food was fantastic...BUT just found out that they did not get the green pass."}
{"text":"Cheap dimsum, hidden Chinese restaurant and they're open late. It's a bit dirty. And the link vest outfits are a bit tacky.

Servers are really friendly and easy to chat up and socialize with if you can speak Chinese. :)"}
{"text":"It's a Chinese restaurant that is open late and has lots of room to accommodate big groups. The menu has it all. The staff is limited in English, best to know what you like to order without asking questions, they are too polite and will answer yes to everything. The taste is good the price as well. You'll leave satisfied. But don't expect the best Chinese food you've ever had. I have had a hair in my dish, it is what it is."}
{"text":"They used to be good but now they aren't as good.  We ordered bbq pork, mixed fried rice, chili chicken.   
The pork was ok. Rice was alittle bland.  The chili chicken was dry no gravy, although we asked for gravy.  It was also bland.   Don't think I'll go back here. 

I think cuz they got popular, their quality went down. 

One star from me. ..."}
{"text":"Great idea to have a confort food place open as at 3:30 am hunger struck. ggreasy delicious noodles( this morning) now i feel sick! etc!! service was slow unfortunately, they forgot to bring my friend's food out 3 people were eating while the 4th was waiting, needless to day when we asked the server for the food we realized it was just sitting there at the pass noone giving a damn to bring the dish! large portions though and well seasoned just drowning in oil! will i go back? probably not.. not unless i m in the area again desperate for food after a long night"}
{"text":"really mediocre food. mediocre service. but hey it's cheap! and if you're really really hungry it's pretty good haha"}
{"text":"Came here with my cousin because he never had dim sum before and wanted to try it.

Service is not bad compared to Emerald, but sometimes you have to make a bit of an effort to flag down a server. We came on a Tuesday night so it wasn't that busy.

Food came out pretty quick.

We ordered pork spring rolls, shrimp spring rolls, deep fried squid x2, har gow, shui mai and sliced black pepper beef.

The deep fried squid was our favourite so we ordered it twice actually. Har gow pretty good, shui mai ok, had better elsewhere. Black pepper beef was pretty good too, the beef was tender and easy to chew. The pork spring rolls were also great.

I would consider coming back to try their other options. Prices are reasonable and it is open late so all around good pick."}
{"text":"During those days where your fridge is empty and don't want to cook. Tremendous is a place for quick and cheap food.

This dim sum delight is nearly open for 24 hrs and service is excellent. The place looks a little dirty and aged but what can you expect from a restaurant where they need to keep up with all the orders of all the customers.

My favorite order here is the deep fried squid tentacles, deep fried squid and beef fried noodles. They are tasty and just enough portion to feel satisfied and not sluggish. One that I would recommend to try as well is the deep fried shrimp, seasoned to perfection it is a must try on their list.

Tremendous is always gonna be a place where you go, if no other place works for you. They have such great amount of variety of food that you can always find something that you would like. Enjoy food hunting!"}
{"text":"Tremendous is good for people who want Canadian Chinese food, it's not really authentic Chinese. You can kind of tell its not an authentic Chinese place when you walk in. 

Open late for the people who are out and about late at night. It's cheap and dim sum is reasonably good. Tremendous is usually has a mixed crowd of Canadian Chinese, and other Canadians. I come here when I'm craving cheap Siu Mai. Like now lol. 

The staff doesn't bother you a lot, they're laid back so when your ready to order you just write down from the menu what you want to order. 

Dont expect 5 star food When you come here, But it'll do. There's nothing really special about this place only that it has cheap Chinese food."}

{"text":"Great place for a fresh meal in the middle of the night . 
This place never disappoints us when we need some fresh n great food any time of the night ."}
{"text":"Decent food for the price. It's my go-to comfort-food-spot. Ordered a small wonton soup, 2 orders of springs rolls and 2 ordered or har gow. Enough for my bestie and I to snack on and get a few good laughs in. 

If anyone has been here...nothing's changed. Same plastic bag table cloths, and sketch service. I don't know if to laugh at this or not, but each time I order the wonton soup I'm reminded that they are pork wontons. Which is followed by the server asking, \" you eat pork??\" *insert eyes rolling* yes I do. Oh well moving on...the meal totaled $23.70 for two people. 

Oh and ask for chopsticks, they don't voluntarily provide them. A glass of water too. 

Happy Friday yelpers."}
{"text":"What you'll like:
- open late hours for after-the-bar greasy food desires
- great prices 
- food is great for those who are drunk; it's popular for a late night crowd.
-quick easy in and out

What's not good:
- service isn't great - then again, when is chinese restaurant customer service great? never.
- the interior is questionable
- the food isn't considered 'good' to anyone who appreciates authentic good chinese food."}
{"text":"Theyre literally open 24 hours. This is my go to place for late Chinese food. I can't say enough about this place as I've been going to this since I've moved to Mississauga back in early 2000. And even now the food is still as great as before. They have dim sum for cheap and I usually go on the weekend. The vest is very tacky as the previous yelper review below and the atmosphere can be modernised but if you can get over that , the food will blow you away. I definitely recommend this place if you need your Chinese food fix."}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese style lobster (ginger and green onion) and ended up here. We ordered 2 lobsters (29.99) and they came out within 20 minutes. They tasted the way I had looked forward to, and service was quick and efficient. No complaints here, except the tamale of the lobster was removed, which is strange for a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has literally been around for ages and I have been going for more then a few years now almost religiously for their hot and sour soup alone which is the best in Toronto hands down!

This place has its ups and downs though; it boasts great prices and hrs but the decor leaves much to the imagination and considering they have been around for so long you would think that would have changed by now.
The service for me is always good because they have come to know me and my boyfriend. But I won't deny that I have heard some horror stories about the service other people recieved there.

My main complaint here is the consistancy of the quality of the food, sometimes it is heavenly and other times not so much. The parking is usually pretty good but I am not always a fan of the seating arrangement especially if your going after club hrs (2am -4am)"}
{"text":"Ok, so I love Dim Sum, and my Dad & I are the only ones in our family who like to eat it. So when my uncle comes in from out of town, and wants to eat Dim Sum with us, I'm definitely ALWAYS down. 

We came here on a weekend afternoon for lunch and it's typically pretty busy. It's not a super fancy place, but it's clean, organised and has lots of seating. 

There is cart service here, so if, so if you don't speak Cantonese or Mandarin, you might struggle a little with ordering. You'll end up relying more on your visual skills to see the actual items being rolled past you to know what to order. 

They start you off with the classic jasmine tea (this is so great for digestion and your metabolism ) It's also included and you can definitely ask for free refills throughout your meal. 

Standouts: 

Shrimp Dumpling (Ha Gow)
Pork Shrimp Sui Mai 
Shrimp Cheung Fun ( Rice Flour Roll ) 
Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf
Fried Shrimp Roll 
Deep Fried Crab Claw"}
{"text":"Beware.
This was my go-to place for Dim Sum because it was reasonable price and food was consistent the times I went. The food is still good, However....................
They've jacked up the Weekend prices $2.98/dish(cash payment) or $3.50/dish(cc payment).
And they now AUTOMATICALLY add on 10% SERVICE CHARGE to your bill. Very SNEAKY!!   
Was there recently and noticed this charge. AND they expect you to TIP on top of this SERVICE CHARGE.  NOT!!
Moving on to another place for Dim Sum in Mississauga................."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch once. 

I was so turned off by the unclean look to the place and the lack of service we got from the staff who don't speak a word of English, that I didn't even order anything.

I ate one dumpling off the plate of my friend, and it did taste good, but for the good of my stomach, I did not eat anything else.

The food might be good - who am I to judge - but the place looks absolutely filthy. One only has to look at the lobster aquarium to know that the place isn't sanitary.

Yuck."}
{"text":"This place is legendary for after hours food while drunk. When this place shuts down...it'll be a sad day for many people including myself."}
{"text":"3.5*  You know what, people?  Not as bad as I thought it was going to be!  So pumped up 'cause after not visiting in a few years, it sorta exceeded my expectations - food-wise.

YES, the parking lot is sorta small, broken up, and there are empties lying 'round.  However, I assure you that there are no bums, AND you can now park across the street at Region of Peel Mississauga on the weekends.  So that helps alleviate the whole parking sitch!

YES, the location is sorta industrial and dumpy.  However, they've sorta cleaned up the inside, added a fresh coat of paint, changed the wall décor et voila.  They have not changed the fuchsia coloured vests from the '90s tho', those have got to go!

The food that I did try was better than expected.  Nothing tasted like it was double-fried or double-steams.  Wrappers on Ha Gao were a bit thick, but hey, they weren't disintegrating!  Shrimp were fresh.  I didn't try too much, but enough to say that this place ain't bad for dim sum...as far as Mississauga is concerned.

Tip:  I neither paid the bill nor saw any signs around, but apparently Ha Um Cha - \"Happy Hour\" - is all day 'til like 5pm.  Again, you may hafta verify this, but if it's true, it basically means that you're getting a dim sum of a deal!  ;)"}
{"text":"Great prices, great food, good service! Love that they're open late and serve dim sum all day :)"}
{"text":"Great for basic late night chinese food, its open till 5am as far as i remember. Lots of strippers in there after 2am as its in close proximity to several strip clubs.... That could be a plus or minus depending"}
{"text":"Great place for late night food! This is probably the only Chinese restaurant open after 12am in Mississauga. 

They serve a variety of different Chinese foods. They have dim sum, noodles dishes, seafood, rice dishes and a bunch of meat dishes. Food is average but a little on the oiler side. 

The place is a little sketchy a night but overall decent place for some late night eats.  

There's limited parking in front and around the restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible Service. The head server flirted with my wife and gave her free food. I'm not the jealous type but come on I'm right there, we're both have wedding bands and we came in alone. Who did u think I am?  

Food is decent and I like how they're open 24/7."}
{"text":"Love this place... their pricing and portions are great.

If your craving authentic Asian food this is the place to go.  There is something for everyone... including western Chinese dishes.

DIM sum is available all day... place now a late... I think 4am"}
{"text":"Since our regular dim sum place closed for renovations we have been checking out others in Mississauga and Tremendous get my recommendation. Service was very good. Dim sum was great but a limited number of items. Price and quality also very good."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place over the last several years and for some reason just got around to checking it out for myself a few weeks ago. 

I visited with a friend for lunch on a weekday. It was fairly quiet, yet wasn't easy to find a parking spot. From what we could see there are only about ten spots out front and it looked like that would be a big problem at a busier time of day.

We ordered 8 different dim sum items and they all arrived quite quickly. Unfortunately, a couple of items were lukewarm when they arrived and the others got cold quite quickly as we could only eat so fast. This is the problem with a dim sum restaurant where you have to order from a menu as opposed to one where the carts are being wheeled around and you can just grab one or two dishes at a time.

Temperature aside, the food was pretty good. We had the black pepper shortribs which were very tasty and bit chewy (as they usually are). They were also served piping hot. 
The pork shiu mai was delicious and nice and warm. 
The steamed shrimp dumplings were plump, filled with lots of shrimp and also very hot. 
The stuffed eggplant a favourite of mine for dim sum) was also nice and hot and probably one of the best I've tasted. 
The shrimp rice rolls were lukewarm and just okay. The fried shrimp rolls were absolutely delicious and nice and warm. They were just whole shrimp wrapped cigar-style in spring roll wrappers and deep fried.
The fried shrimp dumplings were good, but could've been warmer.
The radish cake is also a favourite of mine, but this one just wasn't good. It was far too big, lukewarm and not very tasty at all. Big disappointment.
The taro buns, although very tasty, were again served lukewarm.

All in all, we enjoyed our meal and I will probably return with my family and give them another chance to wow me."}
{"text":"We dined here last night for Chinese New Year. I was very hesitant to go to Tremendous as I have been avoiding it for years. I've had some less than pleasant dim sum experiences and I've always found it quite dirty.

I will say, last night the food was pretty good. Came out hot and fresh, in large portions. We unfortunately ordered a \"Dinner for 6\" for 6 people. Just don't. It is way too much food. That dinner came with 6 dishes, 2 fried rice, large soup, 6 spring rolls and dessert. The value is amazing, but just stick with a \"Dinner for 4\". I now have Chinese food for days in my fridge.

Notable yummy dishes were the spinach with garlic and tofu and meat sauce. The fried rice was lacklustre, very oily yet not fried. It was confusing.

Despite the food being a pleasant surprise, it is still a dirty place. The glasses given to us were entirely too dirty to even consider drinking from. I waited until I got home to hydrate."}
{"text":"I only came here because they were one of the only restaurants opened late & my boyfriend was craving beef brisket noodles.  

Several pros about the place:
1. There were enough waiters around to keep up with the crowd
2. The place seemed clean 
3. They had an extensive menu

BUT THEN...
1. Noodles were soggy
2. Small portions
3. Waiters were r u d e.
- I paid with my VISA and was reaching into the bottom of my purse where all my change has escaped to BUT THEN... the waiter who was handling the transaction decided to note I hadn't tip.  Like hold on buddy .............................

I'm not sure if this only bothers me but I had such a big issue with him more or less demanding that I tip (which I obviously did in the end because my mom would've made me drive all the way back to tip)."}
{"text":"In my young and wild days tremendous was my go to spot after the club or for a late night eats, because they are always open and I grew up in Mississauga. I eventually got sick of it and never wanted to go back. Recently I was out with my aunt and cousin late at night and everything was closing and my aunt suggested tremendous. I was likr ughhhh fine. It's been years since I've eaten here and they definitely exceeded my expectations. We ordered snow peas leaves with garlic, steamed har gow, deep fried har gow, wonton soup, fried half chicken, chicken wings, fried shrimp wontons and shrimp fried rice. Everything was tasty and we all left full. It only came up to 70 bucks to top it off. The service was quick and attentive and I'm definitely going to add tremendous back into my roster of late night eats. @britanysbites"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for years and has always been a late night favourite for affordable food and dim sum. Over the years it has slowly been deteriorating but I have still been giving it a chance. Went there last night and had the 'Dinner for 6' with spicy shrimp. The dish was primarily onions however we were served undercooked shrimp! So disgusting! Also the BBQ pork felt like it was sitting out it was so dry and inedible.  Have you seen the washroom ? Pretty filthy mold and urine everywhere I feel ill just thinking about it. This place is a hard pass and won't be able to eat chinese food again for a while....."}
{"text":"My mom would take me here when I was a child sometimes, I have moved back to sauga and thought I would be a regular here but my last 4 visit were horrendous..

1st visit: They give preferential treatment for chinese seniors, I was in line and waited, a family of chinese seniors came in behind me and he gave them the table. I looked at the guy like wtf

2nd visit: I ordered beef shui mai, they brought me beef balls, I told (the same guy) I didnt order it and told me beef shiu mai and beef ball are the same ...again I was like wtf no its not, he tried to cover their mistake by assuming I was ignorant to dim sum. On top of that he had the nerve to suggest how much to tip.

3rd visit: Take out order, they have a special 2$ cash and 2.20$ debit/visa on all dim sum take out within a time frame that I get sometimes. The guy tried charging me regular price 1 day, I told him what about the special, he angrily said no more special, I though why are you the one thats mad, and why is the sign still up . So I left.

4th visit: Got take out for noodles (about 12$); she gave my change back on a trey, I grabbed my bill first, and  within a millisecond she pulled the trey back with all the change without giving me a chance to get it..I was like wtf, it was borderline stealing.

Annnnnnd that was my last visit..ever."}
{"text":"This place is best for one type of demographic:  The type that stays out late, either clubbing or doing something else, and at around 12am - 2am is feeling hungry and wants to get food and extend the night.  

My friends and I used to come here quite often to get food between 12am and 3am.  I was never disappointed!

The service is very prompt, no small talk, they stand around and wait for your orders and get things done.  I have never had an order messed up for takeout.

If you want REAL chinese food, don't come here.  But if you like 'canadian' food, then you might enjoy this chinese food joint.  They have a very mixed crowd here,  a lot of the asians that come here cannot speak Chinese, so language barrier should not be a constraint.  

I recommend coming here for late night snack anytime after 10pm.

Derek"}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving some Chinese food and found this little spot on yelp. We went there around 11pm on a Wednesday. The restaurant  was fairly empty maybe around 20 customers. We ordered shrimp dumplings and fried chow main. Both were very bland for a Chinese restaurant. We were given a very badly made hot sauce and really old and thick soy sauce. 

We managed to eat approximately 1/3 of the food when we asked the food to be packed.   Upon leaving and paying the bill the cashier asked  us in a very rude manner to tip them for their crappy service and that if we aren't going to tip we should not come back again.

It's very strange how some restaurant  think they should be tipped when they give poor customer service and their food is horrible."}
{"text":"I came here at 1AM  in hopes of a better alternative than fast food places. I think I should have went to Wendy's instead. I am an avid traveler and often check in many restaurants and expect simply good food and good service. I am pretty much easy to please.

I ordered Seafood Chow Fun.However my dish came out, and it didn't match the photo, and the manager who was also my server told me to just throw soy sauce on it. Keep in mind he didn't even hand me soy sauce or any condiments to at least enhance the dish myself. He said it was \"the same thing\".  I was tired and I just wanted the dish in the photo and I asked him to remake it and I even pulled up several other images via google search on my phone to show him exactly what I wanted. It is a simple dish to make so I didn't see the problem.

He snarled, and make a snarky face and took back my dish, unwillingly. I even offered to pay for both dishes. 

On top of the bad service, the place seemed a little outdated. I mean I am not used to eating on plastic lined tables and stained porcelain plates and tea cups.

The restroom was unsanitary and the servers seemed to ignored me the whole time. I had to get up off my seat twice just to get their attention. I must remind you that it isn't busy or rush hour at 1AM on a Tuesday. 

I don't recommend this place in general. However if you're looking for a simple dish that can't be messed up anywhere else then go for it."}
{"text":"I went during the weekdays so we had to order by paper. All of the food arrived generally around the same time. I admit that the food was tasty but they were definitely over steamed. The prices were decent and the service could have been a little better. Don't expect too much from here. It's an average dim sum restaurant."}
{"text":"Perfect food after a night of clubbing !!

Open 24 hrs it is a tradition for us to go to Tremendous after a long night of clubbing. Chicken or Pork fried rice !!  The food itself was not amazing compared to other Chinese food places but the 24hrs the price and service is well worth it.

Probably overhyped just because of it being a late night legend for hungry night clubbers."}
{"text":"Best late night spot for Chinese and dim sum. If you live or grew up in Mississauga you know this place. It tends to get busy at times but that's just because it is so popular. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Love love love Tremendous for their hours and price. They have the standard dim sum food and standard service. During the weekdays, they have a lunch hour special where all orders are half off. The times I've gone, $20 is plenty to feed 2. They're also open till 4am which is also a bonus. One of my favorite spots in the city!"}
{"text":"3/5 because it can be a hit or a miss sometimes. Food is pretty good for the prices in Mississauga. Love the siu mai and the steamed rice noodles. The decor etc isnt really fancy at all so that's probably why they dont charge a premium like the dim sum places in Markham etc. I think they're known mostly for their deep fried stuff as those dishes always seem to be the hot favourites whenever they're rolled out. OH, this is one of the few locations I know of that still have ladies pushing the dim sum carts around to serve you. It might sound silly, but often the more expensive places I've been to are just lacking that old, but nostalgic childhood touch for me. 
It's open extremely late (or should I say early..?) for all those late night partiers who want their dim sum fix after the club, this place is the place to go."}
{"text":"First, yelp has the hours wrong. It's 4:15 on a Sunday and we're just leaving, and they're still open. So call.
Since other restaurant options in the area seemed quite expensive, we decided we'd get a large lunch with leftovers for dinner. We went to Tremendous Chinese and got the dinner for 2 (soup, spring rolls, house special rice, plus 2 dinners of our choice. We also tried 3 additional dim sum items. Portions were large (rice plate was huge) and we'll have enough for dinner and breakfast! The wanton soup was good, filled with wantons. The spring rolls were beautifully crispy. The 2 main meals we chose were lemon chicken (very lemony, which I loved), and the chicken ginger onion sizzle plate. Wonderful, with slices of ginger. The 3 dim sum items were more adventurous items for us... split votes!... but overall wonderful food."}
{"text":"Tremendous is best know for one of the few 24 hour restaurants in Mississauga.  They offer all day dim sum too.  

Quality of food is pretty good and fresh.  Had the different dumplings like Har Gow, Beef gow, chicken feet (which were bigger than normal).  All good.  They do not have dim sum special prices though.  We also ordered a plate of Cantonese Chow Mein.  Generous portions of seafood and Char siew (roast pork) are part of this dish with the wonderful combination of crispy noodles entwined in the wet ones.  

Their hot chilli oil is a good addition to any dish.  The Chinese mustard is also nice to add to noodles or dim sum.  

The only problem with this place is the miserable service of the waiters and waitresses.  They are very poorly trained and almost look so angry when I you ask them for water or tea or just anything at all!  They try to rush through their job when being asked to serve anything to the tables without so much  as a tiny smile on their faces.  It does make the customers rather uncomfortable seeing that they look unhappy getting things for you.  Wish they would improve on this."}
{"text":"The parking lot is limited for this restaurant but it's no big deal. I came here at 6pm on a Monday night and it wasn't too crowded so we were able to get a table right away. Every dish is around $3.50 and you order on a paper menu where you can write how many items you want.

The first item my friend and I received was the deep fried squid to start and it didn't take too long before it came out. It was hot, fresh, and not overcooked. It came with a vinegar to dip it in which was good. We also ordered crab claws, shrimp har gow, pork siu mai, BBQ pork steamed buns, and vanilla custard steamed buns. The crab claw was so hot it almost burned my mouth but it was so delicious. I quite liked the shrimp har gow and pork siu mai the most, they were my faves. The BBQ pork steamed buns were tasty, had food flavour. I didn't like the vanilla custard steamed too much, it was too chewy for my taste.

Overall it cost us $24 which wasn't bad. I'll definitely come back here if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place 5 stars for the fantastic service. 
And 1 star for the food.

I guess that makes it 3 stars!

So it isn't 24h (I really thought it was), it closes at 3 I think! On our Saturday night (3AM Sunday morning), the doors were locked at 3 and they told us they were not taking anymore customers. We were just trying to get back in because we left our takeout box on the table (they did let us in to get it).

THE GOOD:
- Opens late. After your fabulous night out in Mississauga, this would be the place to go. Also you'd see everyone all dressed up as well because, ya know, this is really where you end up. Or Timmies.
- Dim sum after your fabulous night. MMMMMMMMMMM DIMMM SUMMMMM
- Cheap dim sum after spending all your cash during your fab night. MMMMMMMMMMM CHEAP DIM SUMMMMM
- THE SERVICE: very nice, polite, and QUIET staff. They smile when you smile at them, they're actually ACTIVE (they walk around to pick up empty plates, they come to you IMMEDIATELY when you wave), and they're quick.
- Taxi's are almost always waiting at the restaurant front.


THE BAD:
- The food is yucky.....
- In the winters, the parking lot is extremely icy. All girls and guys in heels, beware!"}
