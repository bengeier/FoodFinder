{"text":"Fried chicken wontons are amazing here. Lunch specials are very reasonably priced and you get a generous quantity of food. I had the general tao chicken and it was very tasty. Takeout was ready in under 5 minutes of placing the order (although I was the only customer at the time). The waitress seemed a bit cranky, but that's alright.   Glad to have a decent hakka place nearby and not have to drive to Scarborough/Markham/Toronto/etc."}
{"text":"We've been going here regularly since it first opened in the summer.  Awesome food, great service!  Really generous portions!  We usually order the spring rolls, sweet and sour chicken, dry garlic shrimp (mmm spicy!) and mixed fried rice.  Haven't had a bad dish yet!  Support your local restaurant and eat here!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and waitress just rude and did not care  The food wasn't great and I enjoy Hakka a lot.   There are plenty of other restaurants and will not go back here"}
{"text":"I order for pick up for dinner for 2B and the customer service is good. The food is amazing. I like how the chicken friend rice is flavourful still with out being drowned in soy sauce."}
{"text":"Go here at least 1x/week when too lazy to make dinner. We love their Combo B (chicken fried rice, sweet & sour chicken, 4 chicken wings). 1 order can feed 2 unless you're like my son who eats a lot lol. The chicken fried rice is flavourful on it's own, the wings are yummy, and the sweet & sour is good too.  I alsp recommend their dry Manchurian chicken -- so delicious!   I dont think I've ever had bad-tasting food here tbh. Have also tried their Chicken Pakora - looks different than others but also really good.  Yes the interior is small (they make most of their business through takeout it seems -- there are always people going in & out for takeout), the servers are average, but I mean if you're on a date don't go here. For one they're not LLBO licensed but if you're looking for a quick but yummy Chinese dinner to go this is the place. Just call and pick it up in 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Ajax is a sinkhole of decent restaurants compared to other areas surrounding Toronto. Nothing you or I didn't already know. I often eat Hakka in Scarborough or Markham so I'm accustomed to the way it's served there. Even with that said, I'm actually impressed with Hakka Pavilion. A friend took me here for crispy beef. It's my regular order since. Have had almost nothing like theirs.   Their popular Hakka dishes (noodles, fried rice, chicken and beef dishes) lack authenticity but agrees well with the restaurant goers of Ajax, who are often families on the odd day theres no home cooked dinner. The chicken pakora is so detached from the real deal but again, Ajax-friendly.  Good food option for locals."}
{"text":"Hubs had been wanting to try Hakka food for a while but I was worried about daughter's peanut allergy. It turned I worried for nothing because they didn't have any peanuts on the restaurant!   Upon entering the restaurant, we noticed the restaurant is small and very vibrant in color. It appears to follow a red color scheme, as the walls are red orange and the booths are dark red. The tables and chairs are a black-brown shade and the floor is gray. It actually felt homey in there.   Daughter ordered the General Tso's Chicken because she was craving for something sweet and loved it. She thought the chicken was spicy, crispy and sweet. We also ordered Garlic Fish with gravy, and Hakka Pavilion Chow Mein with Shrimp. Daughter liked the Chow Mein. Hubs thought the Chow Mein was pretty good. The Garlic Fish was pretty good. It was nice and fried and garlicky in flavor. Service was pretty friendly and quick. The only thing that concerned Hubs was these boys making a fuss in there. They were attempting to make change for their $20 and the owner was concerned it was counterfeit. It temporarily concerned us but it went away after they left and our food was in front of us. Will return when in the neighborhood to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"After a nice excursion at the nearby greenwood conservation area, this place showed up on yelp and it seems to be well liked.  The lunch special is $5.95 which is quite reasonable considering that the portion is enormous and really big enough for 2 to share.  I had the Manchurian chicken with the egg chow mein for $1.50 extra. In hindsight, I should have just stuck with the chicken chow mein that comes with it.  The food was decent. I found nothing bad about the service, food or cleanliness other than an overwhelming amount of oil in the noodles. It just tasted kinda meh. The staff was really nice and helpful.  This place is definitely a 'quantity over quality' place and I would go here if I was on a tight budget.  While it was decent, I don't think I would return here again."}
