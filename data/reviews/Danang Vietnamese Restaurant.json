{"text":"I've never tried Vietnamese cuisine from the Danang region before, or any central region for that matter. So I was looking forward to dining here.

On a quiet Saturday lunch hour, we were among a few diners in the place. I had to try the Pho Dac Biet (house special beef noodle soup)as a standard when I try a new Vietnamese restaurant. It came with your standard beans sprouts, lime wedge and Thai basil, but I was happily surprised to also get a red chili pepper. :) I was looking forward to a righteous bowl of Pho. The broth tasted well-flavoured and even dare I say, refreshing. Overall a good bowl of Pho, but not the best I've had in the GTA. We also ordered grilled pork chop on rice and a side of spring rolls. The veggies that came with the rice was fresh, with very red tomatoes which I enjoyed. The spring rolls looked and tasted more like Chinese style spring rolls. Maybe this is how it's done in Danang, I'm not sure. The fish sauce that came with the spring rolls and rice was very salty and had a higher concentration of fish sauce in the mix. Not what I'm used to, so I didn't enjoy it very much.

An hour later, I was assaulted with a terrible thirst which can only indicate that I had taken in a ton of sodium and most likely MSG. 

I may still go back just to try the Bun Bo Hue, but maybe not so soon as I don't like the idea of eating too much salt. 

Overall the food can satisfy the craving for Vietnamese food, but with other options in the area it's hard to say I will choose this restaurant. Parking is also very limited."}
{"text":"I dropped by this place around lunch time and it was totally empty which is not a good sign but due to he yelp reviews I thought i should give it a shot.
The Vietnamese spicy soup I had was ok. Not much more than that.
So, do I recommend this place? Not so much. It's not bad, Have had better but if you really want Vietnamese food then go for it"}
{"text":"Love this place , I come here at least once a month !! If you're looking for authentic Viet food this is the place to be. It's clean , and has a great friendly staff !! You just try the deep fried chicken wings marinated with fish sauce. SOOOOO GOOOOOODDD!! Staple dishes like pho are excellent but I always order the wings :) :)"}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant. Mm nêm is better than any other restaurant I've been to in the GTA. We ordered the combo bánh xèo & nem li. Bánh xèo was very crispy and easily the best I've had around here. Nem li was okay. I quite the nc mm here, it's kind of sweet. I also enjoyed the complimentary iced tea. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"This place was ok. I was hoping for the bo ne to be good (though really, I didn't expect it to be), and it was just kinda bland. There weren't enough kinds of meat. Everything was a little too bland in my opinion. The service was nice, though I don't think I'd return even though I live close by."}
{"text":"Remind of taste of Vietnam food 
Very satisfying and polite waitress and food portion is fair adn affordable.
The price is reasonable.

Love this place!"}
{"text":"Major disappointment. New restaurant just opened recently. Looked forward to eating the mi quang but it lacked flavours. Overfilled with noodles but that was all. Also had the hot plate of beef and egg with bread. They managed to burn my bread and the beef was not that great.

There are other items here I want to try, so I will come back to try them. Hope they will be better than what we had today.

The interior is typical viet restaurant but newer and cleaner. Service is nice as they were not too busy."}
