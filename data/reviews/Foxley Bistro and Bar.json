{"text":"Tapas seem to be all the hype recently. And it's easy to see why. Not only does it allow you to try more things on the menu, but it's also perfect for when you're  with a larger group. And that is just the reason why a couple of my friends and I headed to the Ossington area to try out Foxley, an Asian-Vietnamese inspired tapas house.

The restaurant ambiance doesn't mimic anything I typically associate with a traditional Vietnamese restaurant. It has a classier fine dining style of d√©cor with ginger brick walls and soft lighting; it's a  perfect romantic date spot. In fact, we saw lots of couples there that night all dining on a few plates and enjoying wine.

My friends and I decided to follow suit, so we split a bottle of red and ordered the most interesting dishes that caught our eyes on the menu. This however, was a task easier said than done. The menu comes on a single-sided laminated sheet, with no pictures. It was hard to distinguish where the descriptions of one dish started and the next one ended. It felt a little like reading an essay! But once you get over the poor formatting, you'll be amazed by the variety of dishes that they offer. There is no shortage of exotic meats and dishes, like frog legs and beef hearts. But if you're not feeling that adventurous, rest assured they also do have many good old reliable classics, like deep fried shrimps, steamed mussels, and spring rolls.

The first dish that came was the Lamb and Duck Prosciutto Dumplings\" ($7). These were served hot,crunchy and  with jam packed with minced lamb stuffing. They're tasty, but nothing too special..

Next came a Sea Bream Creviche with Yuzu and Shiso ($15). They're bite sizes pieces of thinly sliced sea bream sashimi, covered with coriander and some lime puree. I actually found them to be a little too citrusy for my liking, but it is undeniably fresh. It was paired well with the crunchy fried onions generously sprinkled on top.

After that, a whole slew of dishes came at the same time, and it was difficult to figure out which one to dig into first; they all looked and smelled so appetizing! The Grilled Marinated Beef Short Ribs ($14) came on a small plate with about 3-4 pieces. A little too chewy for my liking, but it was at least well marinated and flavourful. In comparison, the Grilled Side Ribs with Caramelized Shallot Glaze ($9.00) were delicious. They were made up of two long pork ribs covered in a savory sweet glaze, with meat that fell right off the bone. We literally demolished that dish in a couple of seconds!

If you're a big fan of pork belly as I am, then you'll be in for a real treat at Foxley. They serve a Slow-braised Pork Belly in Muscatel Reduction ($15) with nicely marbled fat and cooked in a delicious smokey barbeque sauce ;it just melts in your mouth!

And while all those dishes were great, my favourite of the night was the Grilled Beef Heart with Chili Lime Salsa ($8). We ordered it just to try something new, and it was the best decision of the night! It came nicely grilled on two skewers so that the hearts are slightly charred on the outside for flavour, and still tender on the inside. Don't be afraid to try this one, it actually doesn't taste as farfetched as it sounds!

To balance out all the meat we ordered, the chef recommended the Kale Salad with Pecorino Toscano and Lemon Dressing ($8). I love kale, so in my books this salad was definitely a good order. My only complaint was that the lemon vinaigrette was a bit too sour.

Upon finishing up the meal, the first thought I had was that Foxley is not as \"Asian fusion\" as I had anticipated. There are some influences, but not nearly enough for me to notice the Asian aspect of the menu. That does not go to say that I didn't enjoy my meal though. While I found it was a little on the pricier side, I did enjoy the food and the romantically sophisticated atmosphere. Keep Foxley in your books for either your next date night venue or for a quiet relaxing dinner out with friends."}
{"text":"The Asian fusion aspect of the menu was not great.

1. Crab/avocado salad:
- Not bad but nothing special. Expensive for half an avocado and crab.

2. Lamb/duck prosciutto dumplings 
- Loaded with meat, crispy skin. I liked this one.

3. Taro fries
- The crispy ones were good but the thicker fries were chewy.

4. Ribs
- Expensive for 2 pieces of ribs. Very saucy and tender but wouldn't recommend this.

5. Steamed black cod
- Fish came in 2 pieces of aluminum foil. The small piece of fish was sitting in a pool of soup. The truffle oil was unnecessary and overpowering. Wouldn't recommend this. 

Overall:
We won't be returning due to the mediocre food and service."}
{"text":"We ate at Foxley last night. I typically don't like going to restaurants that don't take a reservation, but I've been wanting to try Foxley for a while. It was just 2 of us and there were a few empty tables for 2, so we were seated right away. The Kale Salad, fried chicken dish, arctic char ceviche and asian greens were all amazing! My husband had the oyster hand rolls and said they were incredible. The service was great too!"}
{"text":"Spectacular. A creative Asian fusion menu....and they deliver on all front. Blue crab and avocado salad with a chili sauce was the perfect way to start. Sweet, creamy, spicy...Wow. The mango and wahoo ceviche was great - more like a salad than a ceviche, but no complaints. The chicken wings and pork ribs are sticky good. The wings are baked and then fried - moist from the inside and sticky on the outside. The chef should open up a sports bar and sell these wings! The eggplant with yuzu was delightful - a sweet glaze pairs well with the tender eggplant. Our server was amazing - his recommendations were spot on. Highly recommend Foxley - it is without a doubt one of the top restaurants in Toronto. Each and every dish hit the mark."}
{"text":"After wandering around our new area checking out new places we thought this place looked interesting.

Liked the atmosphere, relaxed and friendly service. 

The menu options are extensive and like the range but wasn't blown away by the food. The ribs were great and everything else was good but not great for the price.

Cocktails were decent

3.5 overall. Plenty more places to try before we'd be back at Foxley but worth a visit if you're craving Asian fusion..."}
{"text":"Terribly rude server! When my friend and I tried the vegetable spring rolls, we were both disgusted by the taste of gross licorice. As fennel was not listed as an ingredient on the menu, when we were finally able to get our server's attention, we politely told him that we were sorry but really did not like the spring rolls and could not eat them. He just looked at us and said \"well you're putting me in a very uncomfortable position\" and then continued to just look at us as if we were doing something wrong. We were not refusing to pay for them, we simply could not eat them. So we eventually asked him to please take them from our table, and he avoided us for the remainder of our stay, making us feel very uncomfortable and unwelcome. And yes, we were charged for the spring rolls. Definitely the most uncomfortable dining experience I have had in this city, and I will not return."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Toronto.  Their ceviches are all off the charts amazing.  The rib is top notch, along with the lamb dumplings.  I love it here."}
{"text":"Had a chance to check out Foxley this week. An interesting spot with great food. Funny, I've walked by this place many times over the past year but was never sure of what kind of food it served. 

It is actually an Asian fusion place with tapas style plates - you'd never know if from the name though. I was glad to have the opportunity to try this place. 

Service:
The service was pretty good. Waitress was friendly, attentive, and helpful with the menu options. 

Food:
The food selection was really good. Lots to choose from and I would say I enjoyed all of the five items we tried. We had blue crab and avocado salad (very flavorful), the lamb and duck prochiutto dumplings with a vinegary japanese dipping sauce (the meat is dense but tasty), grilled pike mackerel with yuzu-ponzu sauce (amazing), grilled marinated short ribs (loved loved loved them), wonzu ceviche.

All in all, the food was extremely tasty and flavorful. I was impressed by everything except the dumplings.would definitely go back again.

Prices:
The price were generally reasonable for this area. 

Downside: 
The only downside I saw was that they did not have a lot of options for cocktails which would have been nice with such a great meal..."}
{"text":"There is nothing bad to say about the Foxley. I went here with three friends who were visiting from the U.S. We ordered an array of dishes, each one unique and delicious. The service was also fantastic, and the restaurant is perfectly tiny with wonderful ambiance."}
{"text":"Went to foxley last night and was very impressed by the food and the service. Definitely one of the more interesting restaurants I've been too recently in terms of food flavors. I would give it a 4.5 if Yelp allowed. 

SO and I shared the arctic char ceviche at the server's recommendation as well as the short ribs, cornish hen and crispy shrimp and the green tea creme brulee for dessert. Although the ceviche and the ribs were the highlights, we thoroughly enjoyed every one. Every dish had a very unique, clean flavour with asian-inspired spices like lemongrass and ginger. Our server was great and we did not feel like we were being rushed despite the many people who came in to put their name on the waiting list on a saturday night. Portions were bigger than I was expecting for tapas style.

Will definitely be coming back here to try the other ceviches."}
{"text":"First I would definitely not describe it as Thai or Vietnamese. It is more like a great combination of fusion dishes and flavors. After coming here for dinner I don't quite understand what is the source of all the rave and the lines to go to this place.  The menu was very appealing and unique. I was here with two hungry friends so we shared many dishes. All the dishes were okey, but I was greatly disappointed by the not spicy \"crispy spicy shrimp\". Overall while the atmosphere was great the food was mostly okey and nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Superb and interesting menu created by Tom Thai."}
{"text":"Foxley certainly lived up to expectations.  We came by on a Saturday night around 8pm and ended up waiting for about a half an hour for a table for two.  After much deliberation we ended up selecting the blue crab and avocado salad, artic char ceviche, kale salad, and the black cod.  Everything was absolutely delicious, but the kale salad and the black cod were the stand-outs.  By the time the cod came, we were getting full, but we ate every last bite - that broth is amazing, and the fish was unbelievably tender and flavorful.  Total bill for two with wine, tax, and tip was $110 - definitely reasonable given the quality of the food.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"1.5 start actually
Asian Fusion??
It tasted more like a whole bunch of dishes with the same very rich almost too rich sauce.  And if you don't get a dish with the sauce, you get a dish with too much cilantro.  If you don't like cilantro make sure you ask if the dish has it cause if it does, it is ALOT.

Beef ribs, chicken wings - very rich sauce that definitely needs a rice to pair up with, but just not great for the price.

Spring Rolls Shrimp/calamari/mango salad-did not like at all b/c of the sauces and overwhelming taste of cilantro.

The pancake was quite good actually.

Patio is nice, very nice summer place, and service was VERY GOOD.  I can't take that away from our server she was great.  I really can't complain about anything except that the food was simply not good and VERY expensive for what you got.  Look at the other reviews and I think you'll see some agree with me."}
{"text":"Spur of the moment choice for eats and I'm glad I finally tried it. I've been meaning to get a piece of Foxley action for awhile, but just can't commit to waiting for an hour (or more) for ANY of the Ossington strip restos. We ended up here on the Friday of Labour Day long weekend shortly after 6pm (which is when they open), so we scored a table for 4 straight away.

It's tapas and we were all pleasantly surprised by the portion size. We ordered 8 dishes in total between us all and were stuffed by the end of it. The spicy sticky wings are heavenly. The crispy shrimp with jalapenos keeps you searching for more pieces.The crew absolutely loved the ceviche. Jumbo quail with papaya salad, pork ribs, duck and prosciutto dumplings - yes please! The service was quick, non-invasive, but also nothing to boast about. All in all, we had a great time without incident. 

Including tax and tip, the evening ran us $45/head and that includes a round of drinks (2 beers / 2 glasses of wine). Beyond decent. Well done Foxley. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love dining on patios - so I was extremely happy to get the last available table in Foxley's backyard outdoor dining space. I prefer patios out front, but this secluded area had enough hustle and bustle to keep me happy.

I tried the following:

-Duck and lamb priosciutto dumplings: though I was surprised they were deep fried, they were very tasty (and every table on the patio seemed to order them)

-Kale salad - light and fresh thanks to the lemon dressing, with a kick from the hard italian cheese.

-Oyster tempura maki hand rolls: a very interesting mix of flavours; the tempura oyster was balanced by the fresh mango in the roll.

The food is definitely original, unlike anything you'll get anywhere else."}
{"text":"If you want tapas and a very good bottle of wine this place is it. Mixture of grilling meat and deep fried dumplings and things and even tasty salad. You get it all! You get some Japanese, Spanish and Chinese. Every dish was delicious. My favorite go to restaurant on Ossington for sure! Line is always brutal here but go to The saint for drinks while you wait. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"3.5/5! For those of you who like Asian tapas, I highly recommend this place. The kale salad, pork ribs and spicy shrimp tapas are fantastic. The lamb/duck dumplings are average (we could have done without this dish). The only downside is the drink/cocktail selection. This place does not take reservations so make sure you go early on weekends if you want to get a table. We went at 6:30 pm and we managed to get a table for 2! Enjoy"}
{"text":"The wait for a table on a Friday night for a group of five was around forty minutes.  Was it worth the wait?  Sure, but I think I heard too much hype about this place and was expecting mind-blowingly good food.

The menu is an eclectic assortment of tapis-style food which gives an individual the chance to sample the menu.  Though influenced by Vietnamese and Thai food, Vietnamese and Thai it was not.  I would lable it as an Asian-fusion style place. 

Each dish was between $9-$15 and with one bottle of wine shared between five persons; we ended paying about $35 per person.  Dishes ranged from fish to Cornish Hen to other such things.  I think I might have been a little tipsy going into the meal because I don't remember every single dish we had.   So, in a more sober state I shall go back and report once more.  I did like the ambiance and I would go back so those are all good things."}
{"text":"Foxley has been a go-to for so many years, and I'm ashamed to admit that we only manage to dine here several times a year because we're always curious to try new restaurants, when really, we should be coming here more regularly because we know we can expect a great dining experience every time!

On a whim on a Wednesday night around 9pm, we decided to have dinner at Foxley's.  To our surprise, the entire dining room was empty as most diners were in the back patio;  there were also a few patrons at the bar.  So we had our pick of tables in the dining room, and proceeded to debate which of our favourite dishes to have that night.

We had:  crab and avocado salad, the spicy jalape√±o shrimps;  3 kinds of ceviches (the arctic char is a must have).  All dishes are tapas style for sharing, but 5-6 dishes are ample for two people.  What makes Foxley great is the consistent and excellent quality of their dishes, the unique flavours that are not easily found elsewhere due to the Asian influence to the dishes, the generous serving sizes for the price, and the friendly attentive service.  

We vow to return more often."}
{"text":"Still one of my favourite restaurants in the city is Foxley on Ossington.
It's an ideal place to take folks who have open appetites as there's a lot of delicious seafood dishes as well as meat dishes where they use many different cuts - such as the heart and cheek. So this is not a place you would take someone who has a weak stomach or is a picky eater!
Here are a couple of things I must have whenever i go:
Blue Crab and avocado salad - it's served in half an avocado but it's simple and delicious. It has little crunchy bits like panko mixed in it
The following three need to be served with an order of rice:
The Black Cod - it's served in aluminum foil that they open up at your table and the aromas from the broth are just to die for. The broth comes with baby bok choy which is a favourite of mine and the cod just melts in your mouth
The Duck - it's soo tender and the sauce is sweet as it's a port reduction
The beef cheek in red curry- the cheek is a very tender part of the cow and it really just melts in your mouth and the curry is so good.
These are items that are crowd pleasers as well:
The lamb and prosciutto dumplings- 5 come in one order ...
The sea bream cerviche with yuzu and shiso leaf- the best cerviche on the menu
The Cornish hen- not too gamey, just the right amount of meat that's tender
The beef ribs- they are correctly spiced with a delicious sweet sauce and they are very tender.
The frogs legs - the portions are surprisingly big. Actually I can't even imagine seeing a frog with such long legs but there they are on a plate with some szcheuan spices"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place, and it sure was a hit!

I'd recommend to come here with about four people, as that way you get to try more different dishes but there does not seem to be a lot of space for bigger groups. As mentioned in other reviews, it's tapas style and everything is supposed to be shared. It boils down to 1.5 to 2 dishes per person, depending on what you order and your appetite.

The restaurant is small and tables are close together, but not so close it gets annoying. Although the atmosphere is pretty casual, the waiters clearly are informed and know what they are doing. We were very satisfied with the service.

The food itself was absolutely terrific! All dishes are bursting with flavor, but are extremely varied. The combinations of ingredients are well balanced and original, none of the dishes we ordered disappointed even in the slightest way.

I will definitely be back here to try the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Unreal! Large servings,great selection, surprisingly great pricing.
New to Toronto..best place I've been so far"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing service. Great selection on the menu that I would definitely come back to.  I tried the beef heart and its not something that goes down easy because its a muscle but the flavouring was great. Also, the shrimp tampura is not really deep fried and not well breaded. Everything else was fantastic."}
{"text":"Wonderful little place. Really fun experience with amazing food. It's tasting style so we each got a few things and split them all. Here's a breakdown of our order: 

Pork ribs-very tender. Too gingery B

Shrimp- amazing. Even my friend who doesn't really like shrimp enjoyed the dish A+

Halibut- nothing special. But good B

Dumplings- slightly greasy but very tasty B+

seaweed salad- asked for no celanto but forgot so we had to send back (friend hates cilantro). I loved it though. He obviously did not. A

Quail- amazing. First time trying quail. Loved the dish A+

Venison wrapped in la lot leaf- boyfriend loved it. I liked it a lot but not as much B+

Chocolate banana spring roll with ginger ice cream- was literally just a banana with Nutella around it covered in a spring roll. (Ginger ice cream was good) Not bad though B-"}
{"text":"I've been going to Foxley for years. Maybe since it opened. I've probably been 20 times or more. This is the only restaurant that has delivered superb everything EVERY TIME. The food is intensely tasty with strong, bold flavours. They master sauces that hit every area of your taste buds and they use juxtaposing textures that are deeply satisfying. It's a whole new food experience every time. The portions are healthy. The variety is wide. 2 people can get in and out with a couple of glasses of wine each and a full meal for $70. My favourite dishes are (the best salad in the city) The Kale Salad with crispy onion and pecorino cheese, any of the tangy and mouth-watering ceviches, the shallot-glaze ribs that taste like meat candy, the crispy garlic shrimp with spicy peppers, the lamb and duck dumplings, the Asian greens, the hanger steak with Chimichurri, basically everything! The service is tight, quick and casual. The ambiance is simple, non pretentious, easy and fun. There are many great places to eat in Toronto, but if you want an affordable, fail-safe food joyride every time, go to Foxley."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times over the years.  It used to be a five star recommendation for me, but I think the kitchen has slipped a little bit in the past while.  It's definitely a place worth checking out.  The food is still delicious.  A very interesting and engaging menu.  Asian Fusion style tapas, fun for a group to try a bunch of new things.  The ceviches are always a hit.  Risotto has been good.  Their wine selection is pretty nice as well (ask your server to pair a bottle with your food)."}
{"text":"Came to Foxley in the evening.  It's an asian fusion tapas place.  It's a small and cozy restaurant.  They've got some nice dishes including the
Kale salad (with cheese) - Get this.  Probably my favorite.
Lamb & duck proscuitto dumplings - It's a dumpling... can't really wow me with this one.  It's good, but not great.
Artcic Char Ceviche - mmmm good stuff!
Grilled hangar steak
Some sort of grilled shrimp with spicy stuff on top

I would come back definitely."}
{"text":"My son was taking me back from the clinic when he first told me about Foxley. He told me that it would remind me of my time both fighting in south east Asia as well as when we stormed the beaches of France fighting the Germans. I usually don't go in for ethnic food, not because I don't like the taste, but rather because I'm always afraid that the servers or kitchen staff could be one of my own from those embarrassing days in the war when men would do what men need to do. Nevertheless, I ventured into Foxley one cool fall evening, was a bit disappointed that my Burberry Frockcoat was not taken from me, but ventured to my seat at the bar despite this rude insult to myself and Britain's finest gentlemenswear company. 

I must say that I was a bit confused by the method of ordering; many plates of varying price and size to share. the problem is that no one will eat out with me anymore: my girlfriend Harriet because of my complaints and my wife Hortense because of my girlfriend. I decided to order six dishes and to hell with the waste. 

Did you hear about this 'pork belly' name they are using for bacon now? Well, I ordered both and I must say that my healthy English appetite for pork was sated that night. Also, some sort of aquatic avocado with crab meat in it, and a slightly overcooked duck breast. Reminded me of my time in Viet Nam where the locals knew how to cook a duck like the french! 

Well done sirs! Bravo! i will return for more bacon!"}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Yes!
Finally got around to trying this neighborhood staple and I'm really glad we did -- easy to understand how this place has been around and popular for 10+ years in a city that falls in love with a place one day only to kick it to the curb the next. 

Foxley is the real deal, serving Asian inspired sharind dishes that are just lick-your-lips good!

Visited Foxley with four friends and out of the 11 dishes we shared (it was A LOT of food!) about 9 of them were great while two missed the mark (namely the cheesy mushroom cap and the Szechuan chicken and buns, the latter being on the verge of inedibly salty). 

Drinks are on the average/pricey side, with a large selection of wine and beer, while cocktails are regular bar fare (I.e gin and tonics, old fashions, etc.)

Must trys: 
- kale salad
- ceviche 
- fried chicken
- noodles
- eggplant
- truffle cod"}
{"text":"I'm such a fan of Foxley - there's a lovely variety to the menu and most of it is very, very good.  The ceviches are excellent - my favorite in the city.  Service varies in quality, likely because the room can really get busy."}
{"text":"This was hands down one of the best meals I've ever had in my life! Chala was a wonderful server and really tended to our every need! 

There are no pictures of the food because we ate everything so fast!  We couldn't pick a favorite dish it wouldn't be fare they were all so flavorful and delicious."}
{"text":"2.5 STARS

Ordered:
Blue crab and avocado - good combination of flavours, 
Lamb and duck dumpling - nothing special. One of the dumplings was slightly raw and we reported it. It was a 5 dumpling dish, they came back with 2 replacement dumplings that looked like they were deep fried twice. Not pleased. 
Grilled sideribs -  Not bad, enjoyed the texture and flavour of the sauce. Ribs were not dry
Steamed black cod - Truffle oil was a nice touch to the cod
Taro fries - these were ok but didn't seem like it was freshly cooked as it didn't come out that hot

Service: Service was slow and not that attentive. Some of the dishes took a long time to come. While I'm sure the server was well-intentioned, we found it strange that she picked up the avocado shell from each of our plates and didn't bother to change the plates. 

While some dishes were decent, the quality of food and service did not match the prices. It was overpriced for what it was."}
{"text":"Was here recently on a Friday night with a friend during a wine-and-booze-fuelled night out.

Which isn't to say I don't remember this place - far from it. As other Yelpers have noted, its tiny size meant that it was pretty much rammed when we arrived. Luckily though, we didn't wait long for a seat, which was a pleasant surprise.

In addition to (more) wine, we tried out the pork belly (mmmmm!) and another dish, which eludes me at the moment (damn the wine). It wasn't the quail, though.

Considering how busy it was, the service was pretty good. And the pricing, depending how what you order and how many of you go to Foxley, can range from not-unreasonable to just-a-tad-expensive (as I learned when I had tapas at Salt months ago).

I definitely will have to return here - preferably armed with a pen and a notepad - to compare experiences."}
{"text":"Foxley is another of the top 10 places I have ever eaten. Their is food to die for, but the Artic Char Ceviche was to kill for!"}
{"text":"Tasty stuff! what a dining experience should be-delightful and interesting flavors"}
{"text":"Love this place...have a dinner of ceviches, asian greens and rice, with a nice prosecco. Perfect.  But if they have skate as a special, it is not to miss!  Service is attentive but never intrusive, staff know the menu and provide excellent wine recommendations.  A great date night spot--intimate but not stuffy."}
{"text":"Saw this place on the NYT 36 hrs in Toronto and decided it might be a cool place to check out.  What really made this restaurant stand out are it's marked gluten free options on the menu.  My BF saw this and we decided that Foxley was a definite yes.

I would say about 25 percent of their menu is gluten free, which didn't leave us too much choice. We got the blue crab and avocado, sea bream ceviche, pork belly in banana leaf, shrimp and mango salad, and the grass fed beef kabobs.

The crab and ceviche were pretty amazing, but the pork belly in banana leaf was a complete miss.   The pork looked like ground pork and didn't taste like delicious pork belly.  The shrimp and mango salad was also a bit lacking, the mangoes were super unripe and rock solid.  I would come here again, but I would check ahead to see which are the popular dishes."}
{"text":"Great place, staff were very attentive and really helped with the experience.  Scallop ceviche was really tasty, the winner for me were the beef cheeks though.  So damn tender, just melted in my mouth, it was one of those bites you almost cry from because it was so friggin good!  Also got the ribs special....too saucy for me.  Great atmosphere!  Will be back."}
{"text":"We were starving.  It was pouring rain.  We were on Ossington.  The first place that was able to seat us was Foxley.

The menu was a little overwhelming at first.  As it is a tapas bar, the dishes aren't separated into sections - it's just one long list.

We shared a plate of dumplings and I ordered the frog's legs!  Both were well-prepared with lots of interesting flavours and the portions were perfect for me.

They have an espresso bar, but for some reason don't have milk-steaming capabilities so your only options are espresso shots or americanos (no lattes or cappuccinos).

I made the mistake of ordering the green tea cr√™me br√ªl√©e for dessert.  (I love green tea and I like cr√™me br√ªl√©e).  It was a weird combination and prepared in such a thin layer that the majority of the dish was the caramelized sugar.  A little too sweet for my tooth.

I thought the prices were very reasonable and the portions were a good size.  The waitress was surprised that we were full after only three dishes between two people so I would budget two dishes per person. 

I would love to go back to try some of the other dishes that caught my eye."}
{"text":"Had dinner here Saturday night with my boyfriend. We had several plates and had some cocktails followed by wine. Overall a good experience in terms of food and service, but nothing really remarkable that would make us return soon. 

We had the following dishes:
Crab and avocado salad - delicious
Kale salad - delicious
Beef short ribs - good
Pork ribs - ok
Special fish of the night - good
Fried Shrimp and prosciutto dumplings - ok
Black rice pudding with mango - good

Old fashioned - ok
Malbec wine by the glass - ok
Montepulciano wine by the glass - ok
Aperol, gin grapefruit cocktail - good"}
{"text":"Some of the items at Foxley are pretty delish but I would suggest that you choose carefully. The wine list is cool and they offer great choices by the glass. The crab and avocado is definitely a go-to and if you're a shrimp fan I would say that the crispy spicy (or spicy crispy) shrimp are not to be missed. Last night we had the grilled mackerel and the beef cheek curry which I don't think we'd do again but with some of the truly spectacular dishes on the menu they're well worth a try."}
{"text":"Longish wait on a Friday (no surprise) but at least the quote was accurate. The food was delicious. Faves were the blue crab and avocado salad, the arctic char civiche, he fried shrimp. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We had just been at Oyster Boy to start out the evening with some oysters and beer (which was fabulous) and moved on to Foxley where my party of three shared various dishes. We were disappointed at Foxley's beer selection as we had some great local beers at Oyster Boy and wanted to continue on that train, but the food made up for it. 

The ribs were incredible, melting off the bone and the caramelized sauce was delicious. The beef cheeks were a little off in texture for me but I was glad I tried them. The softshell crab dish was a surprise, we didn't expect it to be tucked in a spring roll and felt like the crab got a little lost."}
{"text":"Upon entering this restaurant, I thought \"Wow, what a charming little place\"! It was warm and inviting; our group of 8 happily found ourselves in a comfortable little nook by the bar.

The food menu was fairly lengthy and was hard to read. For someone who typically loves perusing the menu for what to eat, I was frustrated to look at the crowded one-page list they'd compiled. I wanted to have a mix of cold and hot tapas so went ahead and ordered a veritable selection of items, including some \"specials\" off-menu.

After tasting from a total of 15 dishes, all I can say is... everything tastes like yuzu. Don't get me wrong, the first few bites were AMAZING because I love anything with a citrus profile... but after a few dishes, it just got downright boring! Arctic char ceviche was served with an apple slaw and yuzu vinaigrette... Grilled quail was over a mango salad and yuzu vinaigrette... Salmon tataki ... served over greens and yuzu vinaigrette. I actually got so sick of that same flavour that I stopped eating before I was full. This is not to say that the food was bad, by any means, but I don't believe their menu is well-rounded and the preparation does not do the ingredients much justice.

Another disappointing factor was the abysmal service we received. The waiter (tall, blonde) did a decent job at taking our food order but there were a few rounds of drinks that took more than 20 minutes to arrive at our table after the order was placed. My friend ordered a glass of rose that had over-oxidized (I tasted it to verify) so she politely asked the waiter if she can have another glass and he rudely told her that \"she needs to cleanse her palette\". I understand that everyone has a different opinion on how wine should taste, but I would think that since we were a large group ordering more than $450 of food/beverages, he would at least entertain the idea of catering to her request a TINY bit. After 2.5 hours since our first food order, he nonchalantly brings out a plate of ribs which we were all confused to see. We looked around to ask one another who had ordered it and he mentioned that it was originally placed during the first round of our order. We ended up packing it up to take home, but I thought it was a really unprofessional way to respond to the situation on his part.

The food was OK, but will not be coming back due to bad service."}
{"text":"Oh Foxley, we had such a wonderful time with you. 

Came here to on a Wednesday night to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and got seated in my favourite spot in any restaurant - at the bar. I love sitting at the bar because water service is frequently on point, you can observe the on goings of the open kitchen (if there is one), watch the bartenders in action and converse with the servers. Also, I love to sit right beside my company. 

Protip: bar seats are great if you're on a date, an accidental thigh bump or intentional arm graze helps heat up the evening. 

What we ate: 

- Lamb and duck prosciutto gyozas (4/5) - Boiled then pan fried Asian style dumplings. The lamb has delightfully gamey and the soup inside the dumplings had a sweet tone. Minor bump in rating because two of our dumplings had punctured skins.

- Salmon tataki with avocado salad (5/5) - A special for the night; my saliva glands are raging as I'm recalling the tastes in this dish. Thick slices of salmon with perfectly seared edges and a raw middle served on a bed of arugula salad mixed in wasabi mayo dressing. I'm underselling this dish, there was a gingery kicker in the salad dressing and all I remember was the party happening in my mouth. Order this if you see it on the special's menu.  

- Grilled hanger steak with chimichurri (4/5) - Solid piece of meat. Chimichurri was a nice topping to the meat. Tender cut of steak, however a few slices required a few too many chews.

- Grilled pike mackerel (5/5) - We love mackerel, this was grilled and seasoned simply. Our server helped us debone the spine before diving in. It was light and flaky. 

- Ginger molasses pork side ribs (5/5)- There were so many great choices on the menu we couldn't decide and asked our server to pick a meat dish for us. This was our \"surprise\" dish from the kitchen. Sweet, gingery molasses smeared on fall off the bone pork side ribs. It was the perfect sweet and savory way to end our meal. These bad boys aren't on the menu, so put in a friendly request! 

Our server Yvan (not pounced Y-van or E-van, but Yvan like Ivan with a French flair), was absolutely fantastic. He helped us decide what to order, provided killer recommendations and surprised us with special dishes when our taste buds were indecisive. We ended the night off with trading a list of our favourite eateries. Can't wait to try these next. 

Eat here!

Summary:
Food (4.5/5) - See ratings above. 

Service (10/10) - knowledgeable, friendly, entertaining and warm servers - restaurants should follow the hospitality of the servers here at Foxley.

Atmosphere (10/10) - Hip interior design with an exposed brick accent wall. Lots of tables for two, great for a date spot.  Groups of 2+ are possible, could be a slight wait for groups larger than 4.  

Oh did I say...Eat here!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best meal I have ever had.

Wow, right? This place has got it all- amazing food, great decor, really attentive staff , and also a great location. It's not very often that I am actually almost crying over how happy my dinner has made me. I almost didn't even want to eat my next meal because I felt nothing could top this. 

Foxley serves up some great sharing plates, which is my favourite way to eat a meal. Who doesn't love to eat a bit of everything and share it with some great company? 

We had the Wahoo Ceviche with a spicy mango salad, Inari with shitaki mushrooms, asian greens, steak with chimichurri (my favourite !!) , and duck & lamb dumplings.

Honestly every bite was so goood! My favourite part was the way the servers brought everything to us. They were great at judging what to bring next and when to take our plates away. 

Just one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. I must go back! Can I give you 6 stars?"}
{"text":"Three hungry girls at a tapas restaurant already had trouble written all over it. Ordering 5 tapas to share and then ordering an additional 3 (repeats) was how those three girls walked out on a FRESH food high. 

- Marinated short beef ribs (so flavourful we had to order another one)
- Arctic Char Ceviche (so fresh we had to have another one)
- Taro fries (YES, we ordered again!)
- Grilled shrimp and calamari salad (fresh fresh fresh)
- Duck Fresh Spring rolls (this was my least favourite but still delicious)

We will definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends last weekend. We sat on the patio which was great (except they have no citronella candles to help with the bugs).

Besides drinks, we ordered:

- scallop ceviche
- lamb dumplings
- spicy chicken wings
- spicy crispy shrimp
- short ribs
- eggplant

Overall, the food was okay - nothing that would make me want to make a special trip back to the place. However, I  absolutely loved the spicy crispy shrimp and definitely ate more than my share. The scallops were also good but wished they were colder. 

Unfortunately, the ribs and wings were both salty - the latter so salty that we couldn't eat more than a bite. We informed our server and she said she would let the kitchen know. No one came back with an apology, or new wings, and they were on our bill. Not the biggest deal but just kind of dampened the service, which otherwise was pretty good. They let us move inside when the bugs got vicious! 

If I was in the area I may come back for the shrimp but nothing else."}
{"text":"There are people who run to eat at \"famous\" places when there's a lot of buzz.  Those people would be...well...stupid. Like I always say...there is good food everywhere.  And sometimes good food becomes bad, and other times it's even better.  It's all relative. 

Foxley made a lot of noise when Tom Thai first opened it.  But since I didn't run to go wait in a line, I eventually forgot about it.  Then Cracker came home one day (when we were still roomies) and gushed about how delicious it was.  Then I moved and eventually forgot about it.

But yesterday, I walked right by it.  Couldn't miss it.  Glad I didn't.

Yesterday evening my BFF, his boys and I were looking for a place to grab dinner.  Monday is really not the best day for a night out, so many things are closed.  The Flash, aka one of my BFF's longstanding friends, suggested Campagnolo.  We walked there only to find it was closed (but I just added it to my list so that's always a good thing.).  We proceeded to Black Hoof, only to find it was a 45 minute wait.  So we kept going until we hit foodie-hipster central, better known as Ossington.  From BQM to Libretto to Golden Turtle, it's a fat girl's paradise.

As we walked south, nothing really piqued our tastebuds.  Then we saw the Foxley sign and I suddenly remembered.  It's on my list.  

We ate.  Perhaps one \"small dish\" too many:
 
One of two cheviches we ordered.  
This is Nunavut Artic Char *thumbs up*
The other was scallops *thumbs down* 

Spicy Crispy Shrimps with Jalapenos and Garlic
REALLY REALLY GOOD 
 
Grilled Hanger Steak with Chimichuri
Good, but after the cod came out, it got demoted to okay. 

If I had to describe Foxley I would say it's a fusion bistro.  The menu strikes me as being a mix of Asian and South American flavours.   

Not every dish was equal, but the really good ones balanced out mediocritiy. Balance is everything.

Slow-Braised Pork Belly with Muscatel Reduction
OINKILICIOUS
I love pork belly, sigh...."}
{"text":"A group of us walked in without reservations on a great summer week night and after waiting about 10 mins at the bar were seated at a great table on the back patio. We were very hungry and ordered a whole lot of food but I think 4-5 plates between 3 people is enough. 
The food is excellent - we had the following:
Scallop ceviche - great layers of flavors and doesn't overpower the mildness of the scallop
Shrimp and squid mango salad -  this had a great balance of flavors and the seafood held its own. delicious!
Fried shrimp - this dish was fantastic too - great crunch and texture
Indonesian lamb curry - really great curry and the meat was tender although a bit fatty
Beef cheeks in red curry - another favorite - great asian sauce and the proportion between curry and meat was perfect
Ribs - found it too sweet - it needed a little kick.

This restaurant was a great recommendation and I envision spending a lot of great evenings here."}
{"text":"The food was average...not memorable. The restaurant itself is an unappealing...trying to be eclectic ambience...the neighbourhood is dilapitated and dangerous...the clientele peculiar.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I walked up the Ossington strip and decided we should check out Foxley. We arrived at 10:50pm and they happily seated us on the back patio which was a nice oasis from the Ossington hub. I mention what time we arrived because it was only after, when we were paying our bill around midnight that they informed us that they actually close at 11!. It was very kind of them to seat us and to serve us. 

Here's the list of goodness we had:

Wild Sea Scallops Ceviche with Kumquat and grilled Jalepeno - This was some of the best Ceviche I've ever had. Such an explosion of flavours in every bite!

Spicy Crispy Shrimps with Jalepeno and Garlic - This complimented the Ceviche very well. I really loved the spicy savoury flavours of this dish

Sauteed Asian Greens - My goodness... I could have had 2 more servings of this dish.

Taro Fries - enough said. 

Asian Chicken Wings - They were sticky and delish

All of these dishes far exceeded my expectations. The service was great and the place is quaint. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very interesting and unique Asian fusion. Staff is very friendly. Would return to try some more dishes in the future."}
{"text":"We have been going here since Foxley opened and it is still one of my favourites in this very food conscious city. The consistency and quality has not wavered. The blue crab and avocado, the shallot glazed short ribs and any of the ceviches are what food dreams are made of! Perfect for date night, meeting the in-laws or a quick bite after work."}
{"text":"Asian influenced menu with a ton of dishes that have a cilantro-like herb used in them, so if you don't like cilantro, be sure to mention this!  Most dishes have some element of heat as well, so if you don't like spicy food, ask your server how you'll fair.

Had the sea bream ceviche, which was fresh and citrusy.  Side ribs were tender and sweet.  Frog's legs were good, my first time eating frog's legs- taste like a chickeny fish.  Weird. 

Wish they had a really great cocktail menu and then it'd be perfect.  Food was too interesting to really garner a three-star though."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this a five star review. The food is absolutely fabulous. I have been to Foxely 3 times between 2011-now and had a wonderful experience each time. This review is based on last night's visit. 

The only blip was the service. I'm used to friendly, knowledgeable servers. Last night my server was, at best, awkward.  I had to ask him to tell me about specials and take my order, as he lingered around sheepishly until I addressed him.  
I asked him about the ceviches and he recommended the wahu ceviche without even a mention to how spicy it is. My friend and I like spicy, but I think this is something that should be noted either on the menu or by the server. Anyway, the dish was good. Very strong cilantro flavour and spicy. 

He did warn us not to order the side ribs each, which I appreciated.  He was right, they were very rich -- and INCREDIBLE! One order was more than enough for the two of us. 

We also had:
The char ceviche -- this was our favourite dish.  A stunning combination of delicate sweet  flavours and crisp apple. If you go to Foxely get this dish!

The kale salad - OMG I never knew kale could taste so good!

The mango and seaweed salad - this could be skipped. but still it was pretty good, 

The salmon tataki- another winner, though paled in comparison to the char ceviche.

In the past I believe I have enjoyed the sea bream ceviche and the cod, but did not order those dishes last night. 

I left Foxely as I always do, thinking OMG I need to come back!"}
{"text":"Great place for small plates! The must tries are the blue crab and avocado salad, the sea bream ceviche and the organic scallop ceviche. I could eat a meal just full of blue crab and avocado salad and nothing else. 

The only miss was the fried frog legs. It wasn't crispy enough and the meat was not seasoned, giving it a bit of a bland rubbery taste. 


 Overall,I love Foxley Bistro."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday yesterday because it's my friend's favourite place. It was a great day for their patio which would make the experience perfect but they only had a table inside by the door. 

The ambiance is warm and comfortable, have the natural Ossington feel to it. The staff was very relax and friendly. Since this was my friend's favourite restaurant he did all the ordering. It was a good selection of dishes.

We had the Kale Salad which tasted perfect with shredded cheese; 
Blue crab avocado salad which tasted like tuna to me, didn't like it too much; 
Calamari and shrimp mango salad, the shrimps were perfectly made, very juicy and flavourful;
Short ribs with Caramelized onions was my favourite, tender ribs covered in thick dark sweet onion sauce but with a bit of bitterness;
we had a salmon dish which was also very good, smoked salmon is always very good;
Arctic char ceviche with green apple and ginger, the apple added a nice fresh taste to it;
also had a steak dish which I forgot the name, it was also very good.

We had both desserts that were offered, I particularly liked the spring roll fruit with ice cream. Very yummy.

Highly recommend and would go back again for sure. Great spot for a nice intimate date."}
{"text":"I will be posting waaay better pictures soon.
Every time I go here I leave drunk, full and happy.

First off it's tapas.
Most men don't fancy tapas.. too much sharing and not enough food.
I get it.
But this place is so good and there are so many excellent dishes that men fear not! You can order as if you are in a regular ol restaurant.
bummer for whoever your date is because sharing is best and there are so so so so many choices it would suck to be limited to only one or two things off the menu.
Ceviche- sea bream w yuzu and shizo leaves - uh yeah amazing, fresh, bright, delicate flavors,
Duck dumplings- pass, there are better choices
crab avocado salad- perfectly good but still other exciting things to order so unless your dying of a craving pass for the first visit.
Cornish hen- incredible
Beef short ribs- you'll want two orders
frogs legs- if you can get over ickie factor they are pretty good.. The flavor was amazing but it's because it has over three hundred thousand pounds of garlic. the meat is good... really tender but I feel as though frog legs are a passable option
venison wrapped in shisu leaves- thumbs up 
the phesant is really great as well.
And the rice pudding! mmmmm

You can have a bad experience here depending on if you have to wait or if you have bad restaurant karma. I've gone a few times and have been lucky enough to have a great experience each time"}
{"text":"I eat out 5 days a week and came across Foxley through Yelp when my wife and I decided to skip into Toronto for the night from London. .... showed up at 6:30 pm without a reservation and was offered either a table or the bar.....no lose scenario! GREAT service at the bar- Luke was awesome! Recommendations by starting with the kale salad, followed by wahoo ceviche and hanger steak as a closer, which was amazing!!.... a definite can't miss opportunity! If you're in the area and like a small venue with TONS of character. ....don't pass this spot up!"}
{"text":"Great place to go if you're in the mood to drink and nibble on various small, mostly asian fusion dishes. My senses are always tickled when I come here. I particularly enjoy the texture and flavour of the sea bream ceviche with yuzu and shiso leaf, the presentation and richness of the blue crab and avocado and the divine taste and smell of the oven-steamed cod with truffle oil. When I first opened the tinfoil and was exposed to the smell, I knew that this was a standout dish on the menu. I have tried lots of the beef dishes, dumplings etc., but I am most enthusiastic about the various ceviches that they have on the (slightly overwhelming) menu. Good selection of wines and well-priced too. Atmosphere is \"cool\"."}
{"text":"Had multiple dishes that I liked, ambiance was good and they fit our large group in at the last minute."}
{"text":"We were wandering on a balmy night looking for a nice place that is trendy but with good food and vibe.  This place totally fits the bill.  My girlfriend and I did not have reservations but we walked in and had a couple seats at their rear patio.  Nice and refreshing with a big pear plant at the back . How cozy and charming.  Of course as soon as we were seated we were greeted warmly by our server who was so nice and congenial, refreshing as a breeze on a warm day.  As we deliberated on our orders we watched a parade of delectable looking plates going to other tables and we greedily looked and sniffed at the trailing wafts of food.  After much hemming and hawing, my friend got the kale salad and I had the fatty pork belly.  What a taste explosion.  Something so simple have been both elevated to wonderful heights.  Kale is not the most exciting leafy vegetable but they totally nailed it with some almonds and toasted garlic.  My pork belly was perfectly glazed and melted in my mouth.  Sinful and delicious as any great meats should be. We sat, ate and revelled at our infinite luck at being such a place.  You know you are in a great place when you eat a meal that makes you reflect on how wonderful life is to have such bounty.  This is what going to Foxley meant to me.  I will wander here again and hope to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"MEH. 

was really excited to go because of the rave reviews and there's ceviche! and cute patio. 

The hostess was a rude smarty pants. \"Outside or inside?' she asked when we first arrived. 'Is the patio full?' i asked, hoping to get seated in the patio as it was a hot summer night. 'Patio is outside.' she corrected me, not even looking me in the eye as she lead us out to the backyard patio. What a snap! 

The waitress was nice, but the food took forever to arrive, and despite the cute patio with lanterns and the mediocre food- THE FOOD! we had sticky spicy chicken wings and artic char ceviche - both sounded delicious but were super spicy and oily. so oily that i wanted to puke the oil as i am writing this! UGh! excuse me...."}
{"text":"Always enjoy eating here but I am never blown away. My wife and I end up going here a lot because she loves it. I do enjoy the kale salad and all the ceviche. Never try bringing kids here it is hard sell to get them to eat the dishes and our boys are pretty adventurous too... It has a good all around vibe and most times the service is very good."}
{"text":"I have heard so much about this place and it does live up to it's hype - this place was awesome!  Anticipate a little wait time, they said about 45 minutes and as many restaurants on Ossington, just hang out and grab a drink in the bar next door.

Sat at the bar - which was perfect, space is tight so get cozy!

WONTON SOUP - this was very flavourful and there were 4 small wontons in it, it's a great appetizer dish with loads of veggies in it.

LAMB & DUCK PROSCUITTO DUMPLING - not my favourite, it was a bit dry and I am not a fan of deep fried stuff, but my dining partner enjoyed it so it may have just been me!

GRILLED CALAMARI AND SHRIMP WITH MANGO - this was good because I like mango and cilantro, if you are not either of those fans, this salad is not for you - the calamari was few far and in between but it was light and a good appie dish as well.

GRILLED PIKE MACKEREL WITH YUZU PONZU SAUCE - if you like whole fish, this is the dish for you!  I loved this dish, they de-bone it for you, which was great!  The taste was lemony with Japanese sauce with was salty but light.  

SLOW-BRAISED PORK BELLY WITH MOSCATEL REDUCTION - I don't know what moscatel reduction is - but it was so delicious, it came and it was dark looked crispy from the outside but it was so tender on the inside.  The favour was salty and rich - I could only have 3 bites and I was stuffed.  

Overall, it was lovely, good vibes, the staff was friendly and the service was quick.  I really enjoyed this restaurant and there are so many things to try, there is something for everybody!"}
{"text":"Thanks to the illustrious and chow-tastic Christine for introducing me to this wonderful place! Had she not raved about it's merits I doubt I would have had the cahones to go myself as it seems to be constantly busy from the outside and I'm always slightly weary of fusion food!

We slipped in around 9:30 happy from a night of awesome mojitos and talk at the inaugural Yelp Elite bash. The room was buzzing with conversation and wicked smells were emanating from the kitchen but we were lucky to snag a table in the small, simply decorated room. 

Now the menu is mostly composed of what seems to be tapas style plates of which 2 or 3 would be ample enough to share for a duo. Christine being the veteran, helped me navigate through the diverse choices and in the end we settled upon a Cheviche-the house specialty, the crispy shrimps and the beef cheeks in red curry. 

First up was the Hamachi cheviche which was thin pieces of raw fish doused gently in a citrusy- shiso pepper bath. Bits of crisply fried garlic and fresh avocado rounded out the dish- a real knockout for raw fish. I thought of it as dressed up sashimi!

The beef cheeks and crispy shrimps were served up next and they did not disappoint either. Of course we had to get the crispy shrimps it being a Christine favorite and I can easily see why! The shrimps were gently fried in a delicate yet crunchy enough coating and then covered in with a exciting mix of basil, jalape√±o, black beans and garlic. Very nice kick, every bite was like having a party in my mouth. And again as Christine mentioned what made this dish special is that all the flavours were very vibrant yet all melded beautifully together to zing! Finally the beef cheeks were tender, aromatic in the red curry and paired up nicely against our steamed rice.

Service was terrific and quick, we weren't left wanting for anything. By all means if you're into fresh, exciting and bold food, head over to Foxley's! Just be prepared to ease your way in through the crowds or to wait casually in any one of the area's fantastic watering holes."}
{"text":"Ate here last night and I'm still thinking about it.

Waited 30 minutes at 9:30 on Saturday night with a party of 4. 

While our server wasn't the most attentive, it was completely understandable because the place was packed and she was pretty much a one woman show. When she WAS around, she was very knowledgeable about the food and wine, and provided excellent recommendations. 

Our roster looked like this:

Oysters with chili lime salsa (excellent)
Kale salad (excellent)
Lamb and prosciutto dumplings (good)
Lamb curry (very good)
Arctic Char ceviche (excellent)
Hanger steak with chimichurri (excellent)
Side ribs with shallot glaze (excellent)
Crispy shrimps with jalape√±o (very good)

We also ordered the avocado and crab salad but never received it. It wasn't on our bill and after consuming all of the above, we were delightfully stuffed, so not a problem.

If I had to sum up the meal in one word, it would be flavorful. Every course was full of delicious, complex, unique textures and flavors. A party in your mouth.

I would definitely recommend going with a group of 3-4 so you can taste a lot of dishes. It so fun to sort of forget what you ordered and be \"surprised\" as the dishes arrive at your table in waves. My husband and I both agree that if it had been just the two of us the experience would not have been the same.

This place exceeded my expectations and I would go back in a heartbeat. Don't think about it, just go here."}
{"text":"Asian style tapas bistro.
At long last, I have eaten at this much raved about little bistro and can unequivocally say that it's stellar reputation is well deserved.  
All dishes are served tapas style and every single one of them is a small plate of delicious goodness.
Standouts: Arctic Char ceviche and steamed black cod drizzled with white truffle oil.  (i'm STILL salivating just thinking about it!)  Braised pork;  roasted duck breast are more than worthy of a several bites. but I honestly couldn't find anything that wasn't scrumptious.    
Bearing in mind that each portion is small so it's better to go with 3 of your hungry mates and order, oh i dunno... 12 plates to share. 
Also, being the Asian that I am, i would have been remiss had i not had my side bowl of steamed rice to accompany all of this yumminess.  

I left Foxley stuffed to the gills with goodness, not too light on the pocket and completely satisfied.  Tom Thai better get used to seeing my ever expanding face around these parts cuz I'll surely be back again and again."}
{"text":"Foxley has become a favourite. With every visit I leave promising myself to return. From the reliably well executed old standbys (avocado crab salad, kale salad, ceviche dishes) to the more adventurous (hearts and other parts) and the specials, it's always an enjoyable experience... The rare times when i didn't like a certain dish it's never due to sloppiness but rather a matter of personal taste. Can count on it for a night out."}
{"text":"wow. was recommended here by a chef buddy in SF..such a fantastic spot...the artic char ceviche was incredible..bright flavorful, not just packed with acid, but also a nice touch of sweetness. The fish itself was incredible alone and all the seasonings and garnishes made it amazing. I also had the tea smoked quail which was equally incredible. It was slightly overdone, but i prefer my quail on the medium rare side. Nevertheless it was tender and the papaya salad brightened it up perfectly. had a couple of glasses of wine as well, not the most extensive wine list.... but it was a great place for a upscale casual meal. Super value...will go back 100 times. 

staff was also super awesome as well as the chef."}
{"text":"I've been to Foxley twice.  I thought the food was quite good but I have not felt an inclination to return for a third time. Chicken wings were my favorite dish.  I'd actually go back just to eat those."}
{"text":"Our 1hr20min wait worth every second! The food is so damn tasty, Asian Japanese fusion from beyond this planet! Service and wine complimented our whole experience nicely. Definitely recommended! #FoxelyBarBistro #Foxely"}
{"text":"This place is it.  
Now, I've had the delight to dine at this joint on a number of occasions, so feel right by placing a solid review on it's offerings.  Recently, I was here, with my sister, and it did not disappoint.  She arrived with expectation.   I arrived with appetite. 
  Service was a bit spotty tonight (minus one star), as it occasionally is.  However, I'm usually so happy when the grub hits the table, my impatience withers.  What did we have?  As follows: 
  Oyster Maki Hand Roll.  Please order this.  I was skeptical at first, to be honest, looking down upon a sizable seaweed cone of rice and fried oysters.  Wrong!  It was fantastic.  Rice was soft and not too sticky.  Ample oysters were nestled inside, blanketed with a spicy sauce that I could not place.  Jerk, maybe?  Good, definitely.
  The scallop ceviche arrived next.  It was good, not great.  The taste of the scallops remained delicate and fresh, not having been overwhelmed by the accompanying ingredients.  However, this was not a memorable dish.  
  Lamb and prosciutto dumplings.  A must do on the menu.  If left to my own devices, I'd shove at least a dozen into my hungry maw.  Instead, I shared.  Delicious!  Each other review on this menu item is right on.  
  Arctic char ceviche.  One of my favourites.  The fish was fresh, and clean tasting, providing a solid back drip to the bite if the Ginger and chillies, flocked against the sweet crunch of julienne green apple.  It's like a party where all the right guests are invited.  Highly recommend.
  Lastly, we had the hangar steak with chimichurri.  Angels wept.  So did my dinner companion.  I even peed, just a little.  (Well, not really, but, you know.). The beef was tender and soft.  The sauce was heavenly.  I thought about for a week.  
  In summary, please, bring an open mind, patience, an appetite, and a few buddies to dine at these little digs, and you will have a great meal.  I'll be back, and hopefully, soon."}
{"text":"So let me start with the good things about Foxley...Just as the last reviewer pointed out the ceviches are amazing, I've had a couple of them here they're great. Also, Foxley is a fun place to come with open minded friends as the dishes are all more-less designed to be shared, so it's a great place to order a bunch of things and just dig in.

Why am I rating it 3 stars? I think I came into Foxley expecting amazing food from all the hype I heard and for the cost, it was just okay. I can't complain about the atmosphere or any of the food, but for $40 I can easily think of half a dozen other places I'd rather go."}
{"text":"Went on a recommendation and really liked this place. For out of towners like ourselves it was off the beaten path but we found it and really enjoyed ourselves here. Friendly neighborhood feel with solid cocktail & beer selections. The waitress steered us towards the menu favorites and we thought they were all creative and delicious. It's a small place but perfect for two to share a few plates of really good Asian fusion."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  I've been there twice now and have been totally satisfied.

Small place with a back patio.  They don't take reso's so you either have to go early or later.  Both times I was there around 9 pm and had no issues.

I so enjoy tapas style it's the best way to try so many different things.  The artic char ceviche is delic and the braised vension is definitely one of my favs.  

The staff is super friendly as well.

Both times I was there my bill was $100 that included wine, 3-4 different plates between 2 people.

Will go back again for sure.
A decent wine list as well."}
{"text":"This place receives so much hype which is not deserved. I'm not going to say this is not one of the better Asian-style tapas places in TO but if you've ever been to Spain or have an understanding of Asian food, you'll be very disappointed. Not great value and maybe only 1-2 dishes worth trying. I was surprisingly underwhelmed but my expectations might be different from the masses."}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazing ! Highly recommend the blue crab and avocado salad and the ceviches. Just fantastic and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Following the recommendations on Yelp, we decided to take a gander at Foxley. It's an intimate space - the type of joint you'd hit up because you live in the neighbourhood, know the owners, and just vibe with it.

Portions were decent but nothing really WOWOW'd us, yanno? Though, that blue crab avocado salad came quite close. I have to say that I do appreciate the effort that must go into making that dish! Presentation is very interesting. If I ever find myself back at this establishment, would order the blue crab avocado salad again."}
{"text":"I tried Foxley the other night going off a recommendation from a friend. I have to say my 3 girlfriends and I were completely blown away! From the kind, friendly staff to the fresh, flavorful, delicious food we were in for such a treat!! The arctic cerviche was absolutely delectable and the prosciutto dumplings and shrimp dumpling soup all had so much flavor and were served so fresh! The range of dishes they have from seafood to fried chicken were all outstanding! Just regret not trying the kale salad which looked amazing. Oh well I guess that means I just have to go back!! Highly recommend this place but go early as they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"I have never had anything bad at Foxley. I especially love the ceviches and am really glad they offer such a variety of them, as ceviches are hard to find in this fair city of ours. So thanks Foxley, for the ceviches last night. Yum.

Good wine list with a lot of reasonably priced bottles in the $30-$40 range. 

They don't take resos, so it's a stop in and leave your name and phone # place. If you aren't with a big group or there at primetime like 7:30PM, you stand a fair chance of getting a table or seat at the bar in under 30 minutes. At 9 or later, I haven't had to wait at all.

Did I mention the ceviches? Sea bream, scallop, all sorts of ceviches with interesting spices, mmmmm......

They also have a wide variety of beef and duck and other meats. Last night we had beef hearts which were quite tender and good, if a little organ-y tasting. (I know, not a word, but hopefully you get what I'm saying). The ribs are always great. 

I have been to this place with groups of 5-6 and shared everything, and with just one other person. Either way, they take good care of you. You will notice that the costs add up really quickly here, as the servings are small and the price of the dishes seems to average around $15. Still and all, the food is so good and reliable, and the wine is reasonable, that it always turns out to be worth it.

I know they were working on building a back patio in the hopes of having it ready for summer, but I don't know if the whole Joe Pantalone crusade to ruin restaurants has squashed that. It would be a lovely place to dine al fresco."}
{"text":"The food and service were fantastic. Arctic char ceviche is a must. All of the dishes have a great spice to them which is usually coupled with a sweet fruit topping to level out the dish (ie pear on the ceviche :D). Their patio is great on a hot evening because it covered. For cider lovers, they have Brut cider. I would go back multiple times."}
{"text":"The mark of a really decent restaurant is consistency.  How many times have you found a place you really, really love, brag to no end about it and then when you go back with your besties you find yourself wondering what the hell happened?  We all have our \"go to\" places and for me that would be Foxley on the Ossington strip.  

I've pretty much been a regular at Foxley for the past year and a half and when I'm jones'ing for something that I can put my finger on, I head straight to Tom Thai's place for the crispy shrimp.  Every single time I've been there there the shrimp have been crispy, fresh (you can tell when the meat shreds) and got some kick ass attitude.  The jalapeno garlic thai salsa that Tom smothered those gorgeous little nuggets of goodness in still makes me close my eyes and give thanks to the food gods.  

My eat meating FARC winger Deanna and I hit up Foxley last night after recovering from the solidified pizza pockets at the Laide Lounge yelp event and it was a perfect end to a fun night.  Foxley's was still at full capacity at 9:30 p.m. on a Tuesday night and that should tell you something right there.  Tom Thai smiles at me now every time he sees me because he knows exactly what I've come for."}
{"text":"Chimichurri steak was phenomenal. We had about seven different items to share and everything was so different and delicious we couldn't stop raving! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First, I have to stress that this much-lauded bistro is TINY.  Not 'how-quaint and pretty, a cute little spot' - but as in 'turn-sideways-and-walk-in' TINY.  That said, please do not come here with a party of 4 - or God forbid more - because it will be nearly impossible to accomodate you.  It truly is a slight, unassuming-looking neighbourhood place that has gotten a crazy amount of press in the foodie world.

On to the ambiance and food...Exposed brick wall and hanging lightbulbs are the gist of the decor.  Casual vibe.  At 6 pm on a Tuesday, two tables were free. Crowd consisted of a few couples, literary-discussion-and-scarf-wearing ladies, and a few I'll call hipsters (hey, I'm from Scarborough! Rare sight for me! Heh.) sitting at the bar.  If I stretch, I *could* call it cozy. That said, the promise of incredible food is the main reason we came! Onwards...

Food: Keep in mind, it's \"Asian tapas\" - small plates. I ordered a hodge podge of 3 dishes:  lamb and prosciutto dumplings (just 4 came, not accompanied by soy, but another somewhat sweet, dark, unidentified sauce). They were tasty, but I could not overwhelmingly decipher either the lamb or the bacon!  

Next,  I had sea bream ceviche with yuzo.  Okay, I admit I ordered this because I heard so much raving and gushing about it...but I hate to admit that I did not enjoy it at all.  There was a lot of burnt garlic on top of it, which seemed to be the predominant flavour.  The fish itself was just cold and firm and slimy, and I got flushed and dizzy after eating it.

Third, I had the pork belly with muscatel reduction - a very heavy, rich dish which left me struggling to finish it.  I cannot recommend it, from this experience.  

My friend had far better luck with her choices;  she ordered the blue crab and avocado salad, which I shared with her - very, very nice.  Crispy with sesame seeds and a nice tangy pop, in a cute avocado shell.  She also liked her crispy shrimp with lime and garlic.

For dessert...only one choice!  So I tried it.  Sticky rice pudding with a raspberry compote.  So a mix of cold and warm.  To be honest, my Greek grandma made a killer rice pudding, and this didn't compare.  It was just one semi-sweet mush, with a serviceable fruit topping for a bit of colour.

I was very underwhelmed by Foxley Bistro."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food at Foxley. The dishes are tapas-style; small portions.
We ordered:
- Sauteed frog legs (Frog legs tastes like chicken for those who haven't tried before!)
- Sea scallops ceviche (I'd rate this one the highest out of all the dishes.)
- Caramelized side ribs
- Smoked quail with papaya salad (The marinating sauce reminds me of Chinese sweet soy sauce.)
- Lamb & duck prosciutto dumplings

I'd recommend everything that I ordered :) Although the lamb & duck prosciutto dumplings weren't as special as the others.
Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I was referred this place from a couple of people & was very excited to try some Viet-Thai cuisine where the words \"Pho\" or \"Bun\" appear in the venue name or menu.

I wasn't surprised however when I scanned the menu. It wasn't traditional Viet or Thai. More rather a fusion of Viet & Thai flavors with French dishes. (Hey I said \"Surprised\" not \"Disappointed\")

Now I was told that the place is a tapas style venue but do they have to serve everything that way?! What do I mean? If they're going to offer me beer in the tall can give me a TALL PINT glass. Not a kiddie cup smaller than my water glass! (yes my friend & I got a lil chuckle from that as well)

I took everyone's recommendation of ordering the Wild Arctic Char & that was so yummy! In addition to we ordered the Lamb & Duck Dumplings. A lil word from the wise: Just pour the dipping sauce over the dumplings! It truly works better. We also had the Giant Quail; where it was nicely deboned but lacked flavor. It needed a caramelization of some sort. But the salad bed it was served on was very Vietnamese. Frogs legs were perfectly done. The light tempura batter kept it moist & tender. Literally fall off the bone! Mussels were mediocre nothing too exciting.

One dish we saw every other table ordering were the Blue Crab Salad. It's server in a half fresh Avocado. Something to consider for next visit!

So, 4 beers & 5 tapas plus a side of rice came to about a brown note. Not bad. Well stuffed & very satisfied! I know a few has commented on service; I had no problems whatsoever. Friendly & quick. Food was very well timed & never overwhelmed the tiny table with too many plates.ok"}
{"text":"I've been here five times now, and each time I go, it seems that I am less impressed with the Foxley. On my first visit, it was a definite 4 stars....but now it's just good food.

I will still continue to come back for two reasons: The blue crab avocado salad, which is yumminess in an avocado shell....and the caramelized ribs....which are soooo good, a glaze that is to-die-for because it is sweet and lemongrassy loveliness smothering slowcooked pork ribs. YUM!

Don't get the dumplings.  For some reason, they always turn out to be ultra-greasy and untasty.  I have had them 3 times now, and each time i don't learn my lesson!!!!!

Now that the patio has opened in the summertime, the service seems to be lacking a bit.  It is a lot slower than I remember. 

All in all, good food.  But not the same hype when it first opened for a reason...not sure if it's just me, or if the food has become a bit flat...."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal here, but none of the dishes we had were mind blowing.

WE ATE:
- artic char ceviche (4/5): While seriously fresh and unique, the flavors were overpowering the fish
- duck lamb dumplings (2/5): While the meat was cooked well, the dumpling was greasy and flavourless
- Banana leaf steamed mackerel (2/5): Nothing that I couldn't have made at home!
- Taro friends (5/5): YUMMY. GIVE ME MORE.
- Sticky pork ribs (3/5): My friend seemed to love them, I had a small bite and found them ok.

I loved the atmosphere at this place so I am willing to give it another try!"}
{"text":"This was a great dinner. We had the oyster roll, crab/avocado salad, pork belly and mushroom roll. 

The oyster roll was delicious! The combo of mango, oyster and spice was spot on. I wish my GF gave me her roll! 

The crab avocado, although simple, was refreshing and tasty.

The mushroom roll was decent, a little vinegary, and worth the price. 

The pork belly was more like pork rib--it did not seem like pork belly to me, and the sauce was a bit too salty. But it was tender and still tasty. I ate it all. 

All of this and two drinks, was just under $100 w/ tip. 

I'd go back in a heartbeat to try other small plates. In fact, I would try everything, as the entire menu would have likely been delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious, contrasting and unexpected, Foxley delivers a seriously solid service that's meant for sharing. If you come later in the evening, be prepared to leave your name and have a place lined up to throw back a few as the waits can be up to 2 hours! My dinner escort and I swung by around 730 and by 815 we were dining (Get Well around the corner has a great beer selection).

Foxley offers amazing flavours and textures. A signature dish they can't seem to get off the menu are their sticky pork side ribs... I could see why.  Other dishes of note were the savoury arctic char cerviche and the tangy seaweed salad.... Get them while you can, things may change up soon."}
{"text":"never heard of it and it was part walk-in / part suggestion from the person I was with.  The menu is overwhelming and I didn't really know what to make of the whole place.  That all said, food was good but it was an expensive meal for what we got."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in this city.

Friends, family, strangers etc. may question why I constantly rave about this place, why I fixate on it more than others, why I sit back in semi-disbelief when they don't love it as much as I do... but, there's a reason.  Actually, make that two.

#1 arctic char ceviche
#2 black cod with asian greens & truffle oil.

Yuzu juice, chilies, ginger, ngo gai aka saw-leaf (most favourite herb) with sweet green apple, finely sliced, atop raw arctic char. Oh MY, intensely good. And then, we have fresh black cod complemented by the best broth ever tasted, liberally doused with truffle oil and divine. 

Beyond these two dishes + a few others, must set realistic expectations. This tiny Ossington resto isn't all that & more. Shocking, I know. Certain dishes are missing...something. Wish I could articulate. But you understand. And as a result, are not outstanding & will inevitably disappoint. .

Stand-out dishes:

Oven steamed black cod with asian greens & truffle oil 
Arctic char ceviche
Wahoo ceviche w. mango salad

Honourable mentions:

Wild sea scallops ceviche w. kumquat & grilled jalape√±o
Sea bream ceviche w. yuzu & shiso leaf
Blue crab & avocado salad (if you enjoy spice, it's got a nice kick)
Lamb & duck prosciutto dumplings (why? dipping sauce)
Side ribs w. caramelized shallot glaze (fall-off-the-bone, though glaze is on the heavy side)

For the adventurous:

Grilled beef hearts w. thai chili lime salsa

It pains, but easily forgettable:

Oysters w. chilli lime sauce (small portion woes) 
Spicy crispy shrimps w. jalapeno & garlic
Braised beef cheek in red curry
Slow-braised pork belly in muscatel reduction

fyi: tapas-style, be prepared to share. also, no reservations. 
if a table isn't available, leave your cell #, go for a drink across the street, and they'll ring when ready."}
{"text":"Good food and great atmosphere. The kale salad was delicious. We also had the meatballs, spring rolls,  side ribs, thia vegetables, and chicken.  There were 3 of us and I didn't leave hungry but I wasn't full either."}
{"text":"Service was good but not amazing, I'd say 7/10. The food was spectacular!!! The peruvian anticuchos (grilled beef heart), the arctic char ceviche and the lamb and duck dumplings were to die for!! Frog legs are good to try but in comparison to the other dishes are not that good, wouldn't recommend ordering them. Would like for the dessert choices to be more diverse and attractive. However, again the three dishes I mentioned were AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Had a very enjoyable meal at Foxley. The menu is tapas style with a single list of maybe 20 items and another 4 or so specials on a blackboard, varying from $9 to $16.

Two of us ordered a couple of fish'y ones, a dumpling and a couple of meats, and that about right/ever-so-slightly too much food. The dishes arrived from the kitchen one or two at a time in what seemed to be lightest to heartiest. I don't know if that was carefully considered and deliberate or just a function of cooking time:

* The scallop ceviche with kumquat and grilled jalapeno was fantastic. Scallops 'cooked' just enough, the kumquat really nailed the sweet/sour citrus - I would have like a touch more heat from the jalapeno. 
* One of that night's specials were Gaspe Nordic shrimp (i.e. fresh-water) - these are served deep fried with head and shell complete (almost a tempura batter), and you eat them whole. These were also nice, but again I wanted a bit more acidity and heat - dipped in the left-over sauce from the scallops they were great.    
* The lamb and duck prosciutto dumplings were served as thoroughly filled, juicy gyoza. They were fine, but nothing special. Can't say I could taste the duck prosciutto.
* The tea smoked Quail on green papaya slaw was very nice. I had to be reminded it was tea-smoked, because I couldn't taste any smoke. The little leg pieces were tender, the breast a little overcooked, the papaya slaw was very good contrast. 
* the pork side ribs with caramelized shallot glaze were fantastic. Two enormous side ribs (which means the bone only extends about half the length of the meat and the rest is pieces of cartilage), were melt-in-the-mouth tender, with a complex salt/sweet/citrus/garlic sauce. Apart from the fact I was full, I could have have eaten these all night.

Our server was gracious and helpful. He offered us samples of a couple of wines to help us choose."}
{"text":"Bang on!- bad ass menu, excellent service and killer...killler...KILLLER food. Not cheap, but not a wallet buster either - worth the time effort and money in my opinion. Ill be back. You should go.  I almost fell out of my chair when I had the ceviche as well as the pork butt. Stayed in it thankfully  and ate it all."}
{"text":"The crab and avocado salad is a great starter. All the dishes we tried had an interesting variety of flavours. Don't fuss too much about the different dishes clashing with one another. Nice and cozy."}
{"text":"Both my wife and I agree this is our favourite restaurant in Toronto after the Harbord Room. The food is consistently phenomenonal. It is also a great date restaurant. The restaurant is well lit, pleasant music, unpretentious, not too noisy, and it's fun to share the small delicious portions, especially the  crab and avocado salad, and the shallot glazed ribs."}
{"text":"WARNING: the menu is overwhelming.
CONSOLATION: it's worth it.

The portions may be small, but they are rich and filling. I ate here with a friend for about $20 each. We were stuffed, and chuffed too! We felt like such sophisticated foodies.
Some of the food has some asian fusion influences, but I would definitely not categorise this place as asian.

The waitress wasn't pushy or impatient as we toiled like illiterate toddlers over the plainly-printed menu. Thanks, girlfriend.
Atmosphere was cute with dim low-hanging lights, candles, and high tables."}
{"text":"Vietnamese fusion?  I wasn't so sure about that since I'm Vietnamese and fusion restaurants rarely live up to the hype.  Foxley is basically a small bar turned restaurant with a hip vibe.  The tables are small, so not good for groups.

The blue crab avocado dish had all the right flavours and textures. 
 It was fresh yet had all the exotic Vietnamese flavours (including fish sauce).  This is something you must order if you come here.  The rest of the dishes were great too, but that was the highlight.  Coming in for an early dinner, there was no wait, but as we sat there chatting, I could feel a bit of pressure to leave.  There was just under ten people waiting in line and so all were eager to have our table cleared."}
{"text":"From the outside this restaurant does not look very impressive however I would definitely come back after eating here. We ate on a Wednesday evening and it was not overly busy. The restaurant is small however was never uncomfortable even though we sat at the very back on barstools. We ordered the blue crab salad and was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was the baked portebello mushroom was also delicious along with the pork ribs. Insisted on the chocolate banana spring role for dessert, it was not a bad choice either. The wine list is quite large, and the menu is a little pricy for the portion sizes however I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Really good food and really good service.  Tried 7 dishes ranging from crab and avocado to all types of ribs and fried chicken and still having a hard time deciding which was my favorite!
I like the concept of not having a standard wine list but there's room for better wine choices."}
{"text":"We had an outstanding meal here - everything was delicious.  Excellent wine by the glass.  Nice vibe.  Very good service."}
{"text":"We found this place by chance, as we were exploring the Ossington strip one Tuesday night, and were very pleasantly surprised!

The food was unique, and full of complex flavours.  Some of the dishes I loved were the blue crab and avocado salad, the marlin ceviche with crispy shallots and mango salsa (by far my favourite!), and steamed halibut or cod (can't remember now) with truffle oil.  For the quality of the food, and the thought put into the dishes, the pricing was very reasonable, even for tapas style.

We were seated quite quickly, only 1/4 through a glass of wine at the bar, and the servers were very friendly and helpful with suggestions.  The light brick interior was charming, and the place was packed for a Tuesday.  We found out later how long it normally takes to get a reservation there, so I think we may have been lucky to find it on a random weekday night."}
{"text":"VIBE 
Okay, they have a back patio. Whoo hoo. Summer time tapas. Great date place. That said, if you can bring three friends, it's an ideal situation to try more dishes. That said (even more so), the last time I was here was in 2008 --the ceviche was way better (and different) and inside had more of a reggae type feel like you were on vacation. Now, the inside just feels drab. The servers don't seem to be very excited - they weren't bad; they just weren't great. 

WE ATE
Ceviche. Because everyone hypes this up as THE ceviche place (which it kind of was but not so much anymore. Questions: what are the other options in TO other than Torito?). As with the atmosphere, it wasn't bad, it just wasn't great which confuses me about most of the other reviews (which are about over a year old ....well, those from my friends on here). 

The arctic char was good and I loved the texture with the apple and ginger. Presentation was a bunch of sliced apple on top. If the arctic char was a character, it would be screaming out, \"Pay attention to ME! LOOK AT ME!\" It also looked and tasted like salmon, but that's just me. 

Scallop \"ceviche\" were a bunch of scallops presented on a plate (much better in presentation than the arctic char). It wasn't memorable. 

Other notes: menu readability is overwhelming, as it's about 30 items on one long list. Break it up, Foxley! 
The value wasn't worth it. Two ceviches that were appetizer size at $16 each. With no drinks and tax and tip, we paid $40. 

To actually get fed, we went over to Electric Mud BBQ, had a feast and paid $46 (with two drinks!). 

I wanted to re-love Foxley like I did the first time. I really did but this time, I was disappointed. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
To ceviche or not to ceviche. That is the question. 
Nice date place but not if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Whenever I entertain guests (family, friends, foodies), Foxley is THE place to take them.  Unique, delicious, consistent food every time.
The menu features asian-infused, tapas style items.  All in a quaint, intimate setting. The perfect place for 2 or more people to share, making this a great place to bring someone special  ;)  

Everything on the menu is fantastic, however I'm partial to the Kale Salad, Steamed Black Cod,  and Beef Short Ribs.  My god these ribs are things of legend!  Absolutely delicious, and hands-down my favourite menu item.  I've also tried the Arctic Char Ceviche and found it delicious...and I'm not a raw fish eater!

Flavours in all these items are complex, with multiple hints of citrus and spices.  

This has been my go-to spot for some time now, and for good reason.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Followed a recommendation from friends of mine to check out this little spot. I was dining solo and it really was the perfect place to do so. Foxleys is very easy to miss as the lettering is fairly small and being a bistro it's pretty tiny in size as well. Street parking only. I had to do four loops around the block on a Thursday night around 8 and was able to parallel across the street. The entrance way was a tad confusing. You couldn't see in through the front door and when you did open the door up, you had to guess which way to turn. I ventured to the left and was enclosed in this black curtain. At first I thought maybe they were closed because I couldn't understand why a place would have guests walk into an enclosed curtain. I literally felt like I was in a shower or behind a stage and just didn't know where to turn to break free or break in. I kind of poked my finger around and found an opening, thank goodness. For the claustrophobic out there, you would not have been happy with the situation. Immediately after finding my way, I saw a sign that said, 'Please wait to be seated.' A gentleman immediately noticed me and I asked if it was okay to sit at the bar, at which point he said of course and I took a seat. There were about two other two tops seated and one other person at the bar when I arrived. The interior is beautiful, but very small. Exactly what I would have pictured from the description my friends gave me being a bistro with tapas. I was given a wine list which was extensive for bottle purposes but I was wildly underwhelmed with the selection they offered by the glass. Only four reds to choose from, none of which really tickled my fancy. That was a little disappointing to start off the night. If you are dining with friends however, enormous selection. I went with a glass of Sangiovese, too fruit forward and acidic for my palate, my own fault though because that's exactly what a Sangiovese should be. It was $13 for a glass. I was eager to check out the menu, as the place was described as, \"Asian Fusion.\" Was it? I didn't really think so. 

The gentleman assisting me was the same who greeted me at the door. He was very friendly and thoroughly described all of the specials to me in detail. There was another man who didn't utter a word to me the entire time I was there. I don't know if he was the manager or another bartender but I was alone, in a chatty mood and it wasn't being reciprocated, oh well. I took a look at the menu and it was too much to handle. It was a giant list of \"tapas\" but no organization, no classifications, no grouping, just one giant list. It was overwhelming. I wish it had been separated into you know, 'salads' 'ceviche' 'meat' something like that. I was all over the place. They had tapas for 9 bucks and some for 22 so I was curious about the different sizes. The bartender told me that most people go with 2 or 3 tapas. I inquired about the seaweed salad and the bartender told me that the kale one was better. Awesome. I love a good recommendation. I got the kale salad and it was ready within 5 minutes. It was BIG. I was shocked at the size of it, biggest small plate I had ever seen. It was a mountain of shredded kale topped with a hearty amount of pecorino romano cheese in a lemon dressing. It was also topped with some fried onions. The salad was TO DIE FOR. Seriously unbelievable combination of flavors, filled me up too, I just wanted more and more and more. It was served with chopsticks, which may have amused others if they happened to catch a glimpse of me mid bite. The bartender tried to push the ceviche on me in a completely polite way. He said that's what they were known for but I wasn't feeling that adventurous. Again, I didn't know where to go next, chicken? short ribs? pork? skate? veggie dish? There were so many options, which sounds great, but needed a little organization. Menus need to be visually stimulating to guests I think and this wasn't. I kept looking at the guy sitting at the bar next to me to see what he was ordering because he looked pretty content. Turns out he had chosen the pork side ribs with a caramel shallot glaze. I'll have what he's having. The pork took a long time and then some to come out. There were so few people in the place I was surprised it was taking so long for one dish. Finally they came out and they looked unbelievably delicious. Turns out, they weren't great. There were SO many bones and hard pieces at one point I actually swallowed one and was praying someone knew the heimlich for when it caught in my esophagus. Thankfully with the super attentive bartender who was on his water refilling game, there was enough fluid for it to go down. The sauce was great but there was WAY too much of it, couldn't catch the real flavor of the pork. There was probably only an ounce and a half of actual meat I was able to eat. Most of it was incredibly fatty. 

Overall experience was good enough. Restroom not handicap accessible, located in the basement."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here originally to start a friendly competition with my other favourite tapas place. It is an easy to miss establishment in a trendy neighbourhood that doesn't take reservations. While it is a small venue, its cosy and simplistic atmosphere perfectly complements the excellent food they serve. I highly recommend their various Ceviches."}
{"text":"!!!!!

We found ourselves at Foxleys because we were visiting friends in town and they mentioned they had been wanting to try it. I'm so glad they waited!

Everything we ordered was *excellent* (though some more than others - get the kale salad and the side ribs for sure), the wine selection was so so - we chose a moderately priced bottle of red which was fine (but apparently forgettable), and the service was friendly, but the waitress/bartender was seemingly (and understandably) overwhelmed.

We are trying to find a way to visit again so we can repeat the night and try the rest of the menu :)"}
{"text":"The food at Foxley isn't exactly Vietnamese/Thai in the way that I had expected. However, regardless of whether it's more Spanish inspired Japanese or anything else you could better put your finger on, the cuisine is undeniably fusion - a fusion of interesting and complimentary flavours.

Out of the several ceviches on the menu, we chose the arctic char ($15) with tangy slices of green apple and whole scallops ($15) in zippy dressing. The round of fresh oysters blanketed in chili lime salsa ($3 each) were pleasantly juicy, plump, and petite. The couple of rice and chopped shiitake-stuffed inari ($5) were a more substantial, but comparatively mild side dish. With only bottled and canned beers to choose from, Tiger ($7) proved to be a good choice to wash everything down with. 

On a recent late weeknight, the packed dining room served by one genuinely friendly and hardworking server and a cheery bartender was filled with small chatty tables of excited diners. After going down the street for a drink and then returning an hour later, we were more than happy to take the only open seats and have our dinner up at the bar, where the face-to-face service was pleasantly attentive."}
{"text":"This place is heavenly, solid 4.5 star. Wandered in here on a Friday night with no reservation. The place is tiny and a lot of the tables are quite shit (tiny high round tables barely big enough to fit your meal). 

We ended up sitting at the bar as there's actually more space there than some of the tables. I would possibly upgrade this place to a 5 star if the seating was a bit better, because the food is brilliant!

The menu is a large (40-50 item) list of tapas style food, modern but everything has an asian twist. This is a good place to eat if you are looking for a low carb meal, because nearly everything is seafood or meat and a few salad and vegetable selections. No rice/pasta dishes anywhere on the menu, although some of the curries do come served with plain rice.

The price point is really quite reasonable considering the food quality, dishes starting at $5-$6 for soups and salads, all the way up to $20ish for heavy meat and more expensive types of fish.

Lots and lots of wines but no cocktail selection (boo)

We tried:

Kale salad with pescorino toscano and lemon dressing ($8)

Vegetable salad fresh spring rolls ($6)

Lamb and duck prosciutto dumplings ($7)

Grilled lemongrass cornish hen ($12)

Grilled side-ribs with caramelized shallot glaze ($9)

Grilled hanger steak with chimichurri ($17) 

The side-ribs are RIDICULOUS, must have them again. The kale salad was amazing too. 6 dishes was too much for 2 people, 4-5 dishes would have been plenty. 

The bill for 2 was still only $120 with tax and tip, including the 6 dishes, lots of leftovers, and 3 glasses of wine.

Our bartender/server was awesome too. Will totally be back here!"}
{"text":"Went to Foxley on a Friday night around 6:30pm. I had read reviews about this place and found a common theme to be good tasting food and really busy. We were able to get a seat for 2 when we got there. The place is quite small, maybe seats 40 people I would estimate.

As for the food, it was very tasty. The food was good although I agree with another reviewer about the texture of the beef cheeks. I really enjoyed the ceviche as well.

My only complaint is that in order to be satisfied with the meal, you are looking at minimum 4 dishes for 2 people, with 6 being more appropriate. At $12-$17 per plate, it can get a bit expensive. This is probably typical for a tapas restaurant, which I didn't realize it was until we got there."}
{"text":"Asian fusion small plates; sit in back patio or at bar; excellent service; small place so can get busy"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend on a Saturday night. The place was jammed. I highly recommend making reservations if you're planning on going during prime dinner hours. Food is very flavorful however the service was so poor at this restaurant that it ruined the experience."}
{"text":"I'd heard and read nothing but positive things from sources I trust (Sources I trust: Friends, Globe and Mail, Joanne Kates. Sources I don't trust: 905ers on Yelp.), but Foxley always seemed to fly a little under my radar when it actually came time to answer the question \"What to eat tonight?\"

I finally gave it a try and was very impressed, despite the polarizing reviews. For what it's worth, we took most of our server's recommendations and ordered: the crab and avocado salad; a Lao-style spicy beef salad; a wahoo and peach ceviche; fried shrimp with jalapenos and garlic; and red curry beef cheek. I thought the curry lacked some depth and spice but everything else was great, particularly the fish ceviche and crispy shrimp.

Portions are ample. I can (and do, with alarming regularity) take down a large pizza myself in 20 minutes when I'm hungry and I left Foxley very full. You should be pretty satisfied ordering 5 dishes between two people. By my math that's about $80 of food -- not exactly breaking the bank, so people here should stop complaining about portion sizes and just order one more dish for $12-$16 if you're still hungry.

Service was really friendly and the back patio is a great place to sit on a summer night. (Not too many left, unfortunately.) I will definitely be adding Foxley to my rotation."}
{"text":"There are more places than you would think that cater to dietary restrictions, which made me realize how prevalent these allergens (gluten and dairy) must be.  I was relieved when I called Foxley earlier that day and they acknowledged that they could modify most of their dishes.  No further research required! 

The menu consists of tapas ranging from $8 to $22.  I'm a HUGE fan of tapas and being able to try a variety of smaller dishes.  If you're not enjoying one item, it's no problem.  You can try the next, then the next.   At Foxley, it's the contrary - trying to balance your consumption across their palate pleasing menu is the real challenge. 

Avocado stuffed with blue crab ($10) -  Our last time at Foxley the two guys next to us shook their heads when we told them this wasn't one of our selections.   I wasn't making the same mistake again.   The stuffed avocado was the first dish I ordered.  NOW I understand why they expressed such disappointment months ago.  The shredded (and real) crab meat is so flavourful and a perfect match for the smooth avocado (still in its shell).  

Grilled calamari and shrimp with mango ($14) - This was refreshing but didn't make it into the top ranks when comparing to other calamari dishes.  The sweetness of the mango didn't seem to come through in the calamari rings themselves.  I might get my hand slapped for saying this, but it reminded me of one of the signature appetizers at Spring Rolls or similar Thai takeout place.  Having said that, the shrimp on top was a nice added touch.  Worth a try if you enjoy mango salad. 

Sea bream ceviche with yuzu and shiso leaf ($15) -  They have a few ceviche dishes on the menu.  This was one that did not contain soy.  The fish was thinly sliced and blanketed with fresh herb (shiso) and the juice of a Japanese citrus fruit (yuzu).  It was so tender it almost melted in your mouth.  Mmm...mmm.   When we got down to the last piece I was tempted to snag it, but held myself back.  Remember, I still had to win over Keith's friends.   When Melissa went in for half I was relieved.  I assumed it gave me free rein to take the rest.  That I did, without guilt.

Curried vegetables ($15 I think) -  Keith and I had this previously and it stuck with us.  A good excuse to get some veggies into the variety.  The waiter claimed that it's creamy texture (think yellow thai curry) came from the coconut milk, and nothing else.  I wasn't going to dispute this.  I dove in and selfishly had more than my share.   It had some kick so if you can't handle spice, rethink this one.

Grilled hanger steak with chimichuri sauce ($) - I had a little taste of this but it was a little too chewy for my liking.  Apologize in advance for saying this, but it's not ideal when you have to discreetly spit pieces of fat into a napkin.  I enjoyed the topping, which helped moisten and flavour the sliced beef, but not so much the beef itself. 

Asian Style Greens ($8) -  Just what we needed.  A splash of green at the table to offset the abundance of meat and proteins around us.  I would have guessed the asian broccoli and green beans were flavoured with soy sauce but the waiter indicated otherwise.  Crunchy, tasty and green.  Perfect."}
{"text":"Service is good. Food is solid. Good crowd. Foxley largely serves Asian food.  Good executed Asian food similar to the Chinese food in Richmond Hill. If you like tapas in Asian style, this is not a bad place. Of course, you will pay the tapa price."}
{"text":"My date and I were looking for someplace to eat on a Wednesday night that wasn't packed, because this place is probably the longest running restaurant on Ossington (besides the original vietnamese places), there was actually a table - amazing!
The menu is a single page listing about 30 small plates ranging from $9-$25.  It's one of the first places that was doing asian fusion before it become a trend and hte chef expertly mixes up flavours for some seriously tasty dishes.
The server recommended 4-5 between the 2 of us and we ended up ordering 4:
Scallop Ceviche - wowowowow.....so good, we got about 6 decent sized scallops that were amazingly fresh.
Spicy Crispy Shrimps with Jalapenos and Garlic - again perfectly crispy, not too greasy, delicious sauce and the shrimps were big and fresh
Beef cheeks in a red curry sauce - the beef was fork tender, almost like pulled pork, in a rich curry....coma inducing heavy...but worth the calories
Slow-Braised Pork Belly with Muscatel Reduction - so good...but if you're not familiar with pork belly, be prepared for the 1\" layer of fat and the 1/4\" layer of meat, pure indulgence.

If you want to splurge, i would recommend the steamed black cod - you get a whole fish wrapped in aluminum that takes a while to prepare... but it is heaven (still remember it from 2 years ago)
There were a handful of wines by the glass and we were actually too full to have dessert.
Always loved this place, it's never disappointed me - a foodie favourite!"}
{"text":"Came for the first time yesterday for dinner and it was wonderful. the service was excellent, very attentive. The Riesling is superb. there was supposed to be an hour wait, but the table in front of us dropped out so we waited maybe 10 mints for a table. on to the food!
blue crab and avocado - really nice mix of flavours here. the crab with the avocado matched well and it was served in a half avocado.  the only critique i would have is that there isn't a combination of textures, which is a bit one-dimensional (but that's getting really picky). we loved this and would get it again for sure.
arctic char ceviche - like others, this was really good. had a nice spicyness to it, and the apple julienned on top really provided a crispness to the dish. very light, and tasty. winner. 
spicy shrimp with jalepano - this was so flavourful, we really liked this one. the shrimp is cooked in a way that made it crispy but not oily or greasy. it was stir fried with minced jalepanos and onions which gave it a very nice smokey flavour. this was a winner. 
scallop ceviche - there was a good amount of scallops on the plate, maybe 9-10 of them, but i just found this dish so-so. it was fragrant, but it just  fell a bit flat for me, but my friend liked this. i think it would have been better if there were some chopped scallions or  organic micro-greens on it to brighten it up a bit.
duck spring rolls - these were like the fresh spring rolls that you would get from a pho place. rice roll wrap, basil, mint, vermicelli, and minced duck. nothing special here. these tasted good, but i probably wouldn't get this again. 
beef hearts - these came on a skewer which we weren't expecting of heart is a bit tough as a meat. so i was expecting like really thin slices of heart. in any case, it was done well, and served with an acidic sauce which did a good job to cut the toughness of the meat. didn't taste like an organ meat at all. my friend and i spoke about how it would be hard pressed for us to even identify it as heart meat. we got this towards the end of the meal so it was just a bit heavy at this point. prob wouldn't get this again.
duck dumplings - this was 5 or 6 deep fried pot stickers. filled  with meat. solid meaty dumplings these were. lol. the sauce was a fish sauce vinaigrette. it was ok.. 
black cod - served in a tin foil wrap,  with dried seaweed, mushrooms and greens. It's  straight from a 375F oven. so so good. 

would def return."}
{"text":"A great atmosphere with a back patio hidden in the back., the Foxley has a great tapas menu.  I haven't been disappointed with anything I've tried.  My favourite is the Artic Char cevechi (a sharp citrus taste and the fish is exceptionally fresh) and the short ribs (they fall off the bone and have an incredible sauce).  They make a great old fashioned and have a good drink selection generally.  

I get that the restaurant is small, which is great for creating a sense of intimacy, but you do get rushed.  If you linger (even if you are ordering drinks) the server will start hovering and make it very clear you should be moving on.  I also find the service to be a bit gruff and unfriendly.  Perhaps this is supposed to add to its hipster cred but it unnecessary and pulls the experience down. As a result, I don't come here nearly as often as I would otherwise."}
{"text":"Reasons I Like Foxley.

1. The simple, unflashy, unbranded menu. Just a list of dishes with prices.
2. The lamb and duck proscuitto dumpllings.*
3. The crab avocado salad. Just tasty crab in an avocado, with hot sauce. 
4. The ribs with a caramelized shallot glaze.**
5. The spicy, crispy shrimp w/ jalopeno and garlic.
6. The lovely woman behind the counter, who made great suggestions.
7. And didn't say a word about my cowboy hat. I could be a cowboy. You don't even know me. 
__________

*I could use some punctuation here. Is this duck proscuitto in the dumpling? Is the dumpling skin itself made of prosciutto? The world will never know. 
**This was the best thing I ate while in Toronto. I was only there for 24 hours, but still."}
{"text":"i've been here soooo many times and have my order down pat. blue crab salad add extra sriracha, chimichurri hanger steak  arctic char ceviche, kale salad and the cod are all winners. in my opinion the hanger steak steals the show. go early to get a table without lining up. no seats available? get it to go!!!"}
