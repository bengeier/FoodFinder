{"text":"Consort and I went on a rainy nite and it was really cool. The tapas were very tasty & we enjoyed the wine. The atmosphere makes it feel comfortable and cozy. Plus the server was fantastic.  For my first time there I enjoyed it very much.   The pork tacos were delightful."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly people.  Quick service. Great location in Sewickley village. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Took my wife for tapas on a Monday night.  Walked in and wasn't sure if it was self seating.  The waiter (maybe owner) was in the back for a few minutes so we stood there kind of awkwardly.  After he came out we were offered to pick any open table.  We tried a corner and then changed our minds and moved to the bar.  We shared 6 tapas while I sampled the riojas.  My wife asked for sangria which the bartender made on the spot.  The wines were decent but unremarkable the sangria was excellent for something whipped up on request.  Most of our tapas were fantastic.  The cheese plate and olive plate were great values.  The lamb chops lived up to expectations and the roasted vegetables exceeded them.  I would say the pork bellies were ok but difficult to eat.  The scallops were cooked well and I liked the flavor but the tomato sauce overpowered the pistachio sauce leaving me wondering why they were paired.  My wife got a lemon cake for dessert and it was much better than I anticipated.  Light and airy with the right balance of flavors.  Overall we will be coming back and recommending to friends."}
{"text":"I was here with a group of friends recently and we ended ordering almost everything on the menu to share and everything we tried was delicious and perfectly cooked.

The dishes were brought out at just the right times so we never had too much on the table and the staff was attentive and friendly. 

The duck and the lamb were especially amazing, in part because of the incredibly delicious sauces.  Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place the other night. We had never been to a tapas bar before, and we'll try anything once. I'm glad we went! We started with the antipasti plate, and since we couldn't decide between the fig toastas and the smoked salmon (I can't remember the dish name), we ordered both. After we demolished the plates, we actually had room for dessert, so I ordered the tiramisu for us to share. 

I was impressed that the owner was taking the time to actually chat with diners (most of whom sound like regulars, always a good sign), and he readily gave his advice when my husband was unsure of which spirit to drink with dinner. 

The ONLY reason this place didn't receive five stars is because there are two steps in front of the building that someone in a wheelchair can find intimidating. But because I had a companion, we got in with no further problems. I know that we'll be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Tuna, scallops, everything was fresh and delicious. Prices very reasonable for the quality. Good wine menu.

If you live in the area don't let them go away."}
{"text":"The owner took time to introduce himself and made a fuss over us. Great service and great food"}
{"text":"Cozy relaxing lounge, friendly and helpful staff, tasty small bites menu. Husband and I shared a bottle of wine and desserts for an after-dinner, kids free date night. Waitress suggested a good bottle of wine when we told her our preference for wine type and price point. The chocolate cake and pumpkin cheesecake were delicious. It was quiet and cozy for a romantic conversation. We will plan to go back next time \"grandma puts our kids to bed\"."}
{"text":"Tapas were delicious, salmon was perfect! Enjoyed a nice glass of wine and shared a couple different dishes with my wife. The atmosphere is relaxing and quaint."}
{"text":"Following a long and humid day of housewares shopping, a proper beverage and light faire was in order; Lulas' delivered. 

All the plates were an appropriate size as a tapa, and anything with figs was wonderful. The owner happened to be seated next to us, and upon seeing the portion of our Tuna Tartar (which he told us he was dissatisfied with) he brought us out a second round on the house.  Any restaurant/bar/establishment owner that blatantly says he's not happy with *blank* and fixes it someone I want to support. If I didn't live in Portland, Oregon I'd be back sooner."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a tapas fan, if I order a meal I actually want more than three bites of it. This place is the exception to the rule. I have eaten here several times, with my wife and friends. The food is fantastic, portions are better than most tapas restaurants. The atmosphere is ok, I'm not a fan of sitting on make shift benches or backless stools. The interior could use some updating."}
{"text":"Meh, so I have been here twice and not been super impressed either time. I have friends that absolutely love Lule, but my husband and I were just not that impressed. 

Also, I called a couple of weeks ago on Saturday to see if they were open on Sunday to take my mom to lunch. The hostess said they were, I said oh great because Yelp says you are closed on Sunday. She was like no we will be open.... They were closed..."}
{"text":"Excellent menu options like roasted vegetable plate, winter salad with goat cheese and almonds, baba ganoush, and filet with fig sauce. The atmosphere and music selections are charming. The wine list is comprehensive and will offer a glass or bottle that satisfies any wine drinker's palette."}
{"text":"This is more of a 3.5 stars for me, but giving the 4 for the overall experience.  I enjoyed Lula, but I wasn't blown away.

Starting off with the good;  great ambiance and friendly service.  I loved the decoration, the tables and booths are more conducive for hanging out and relaxing rather than a full dining experience.  It's a very relaxed and chill environment.  The service was prompt and incredible helpful with decisions.  

The mediocre included the food and drinks.  So they have a decent wine selection and some beers, just stick to the wine.  Although they have a full bar, the mixed drinks are no good.  For food, we ordered the burrata, meatballs, and salmon for 2.  All were delicious, but like I mentioned nothing that awed my taste buds.  Even though its a 'tapas' place, this is not tapas at all.  Thus, if you're looking for traditional tapas dishes forget it;  the portions are large; the food selection varies from kale chips, japanese style chicken, and burrata with prosciutto, and you will not find Spanish food on the menu.  

The only thing remotely similar to tapas is you're sharing plates, of which 3 was just the right amount for 2 people, I wouldn't order more than 4 if it's just a party of 2. 

I'll have to try some more dishes to give an updated review, but 4 stars on the service and ambiance and 3 stars on the food.  Just note they don't take reservations.  We came in at 6PM on a Friday and were able to be seated without a wait."}
{"text":"Lula's website was under construction, so there was minimal info online.  I'm not sure if this was a temporary host issue, or ongoing, but they really need to fix this.  The website did not have their regular menu displayed, or a wine/beer list, but it advertised a \"weekend prix fixe menu.\"  I inquired about this when I called (this was on a Friday), and the host confirmed it. Lula doesn't take reservations, but the host said we shouldn't have a problem finding a table, but she took my number, so they could set aside some space for us if they got busy. She was friendly, and when I asked a question she did not know the response to, she called me back within 2 minutes with an answer.  

Once seated (right away,) I inquired about the prix fixe menu options that I had discussed earlier with the hostess, and our waitress told us that that was from Valentine's Day weekend last month, and was inadvertently left on their website. That was a disappointment, since tapas restaurants typically leave us feeling hungry, so we thought that it would be a great option for dinner. The hostess on the telephone had been so helpful, but I was surprised that she was not notified that the prix fixe menu was not still happening, after a month.

The wine list was okay. It would have been nicer to have more variety, and more higher quality wines (if I am going to a wine bar, I expect to have some really great selections.) The wines by the glass were pretty unimpressive (I realize that wines by the glass are typically $10-15 store price bottles, so this wasn't a surprise; however, for a wine bar, I would have expected more options for people to try something nice.) They had some decent wines by the bottle, but nothing spectacular.  I realize restaurant wines are usually about 3-4 times what you would pay in a wine shop, but again, for the price, I would have expected more variety in high quality wines. They had some representation of popular Napa Valley wineries such as Duckhorn and Rombauer, but it would have been nice to see more varietals, like Zinfandels and Super Tuscans. I must note, if you don't see any wine that you like, they have a very reasonable corkage fee of $10. 

Since the prix fixe menu was not happening, we ordered a few tapas for our table to share.  I know that I can't compare real Spanish tapas to the much smaller and more expensive American version, so as far as that goes, Lulas was pretty standard for American \"tapas\" when it comes to price, portion, and well, value. But we were really hoping for the prix fixe, since we were coming for dinner, not just a snack.  I just wish that the website (and host I spoke with) had mentioned that ordering tapas a la carte was the only option, since the advertised dinner special for the weekend was from last month.

I love cheese, and the cheese platter was a big disappointment. The hot boursin cheese was good, but the rest of the cheese was pretty bland. I was surprised to see annatto-colored mild cheddar cheese, and a rather boring Swiss. I expected more locally-sourced or at least more interesting cheeses that varied in intensity (e.g. a nice soft cheese, such as a Brie/Camembert, or maybe a blue cheese.) For the price, it was simply not worth it, and I wouldn't order it again. The meatballs were average; they were presented nicely, and the price was not bad, but they weren't that flavorful. The plantain nachos were okay; our table was divided on that one. The dates wrapped in bacon were good, but very small portions. The carrot ginger soup was very good, and it was a nice amount.

Overall, we had fun, and the service was friendly enough, but we were disappointed in not having the prix fixe menu (which is apparently my phrase of the day!) when it was clearly advertised on the website. Our meals, including drinks, came to $27 per person, and two of us still felt a little hungry when we left. So, not that atypical of a tapas place, but just know what to expect. But Lula's has a nice vibe and comfortable, lounge-typed seating.

I really want this place to succeed, so I would recommend that they, first off, fix and update their website. In this age of technology, the impression of a restaurant begins before a customer sets foot (or doesn't) in a restaurant, so presenting yourself well is very important. I would also recommend adding more veg options. The cheese platter needs a complete revamp. I am more than willing to spend some money to try good cheeses, but the cheddar and Swiss seemed, well, kind of like Kraft. The location and vibe are great selling points. It's nice for a drink and a snack, but as of now, I wouldn't consider it to be a real option for me to return for an actual dinner. I am hoping that they add more menu options (especially more vegetarian ones) so that it could suffice as dinner for meat and plant eaters alike. I think if they offer more variety of dishes that are a bit more filling, they could have a really good thing going."}
{"text":"Nice variety of options and everything we had was very high quality.  Portion sizes were very good for tapas and we shared 5 dishes among the 3 of us.  My favorite were the chicken lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to grab a few glasses of wine and some tapas, and we left stuffed and happy from the delicious red wine we ordered.  We tried two proteins (salmon and steak) and two veggies (salad and roasted root veg), and we couldn't finish everything.  The salmon in particular was on point; I just wish there was more of the wasabi honey sauce!  I really enjoy Lula's atmosphere; it's intimate and cozy.  The only drawback is that seating can be tight.  My boyfriend and I are both pretty tall, so we ended up cramming together on one side of a bench seat, however, that did end up being a sweet and romantic arrangement!  All in all, I really enjoyed my first experience here and look forward to dropping in again."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, food, ambience, and service. Have been coming here for quite a few years and it always a positive experience."}
{"text":"Lula is one of the most adorable bar's I have ever been to. The reason for the four stars is because I visited this establishment a few years back (and just found it on Yelp, yay). I haven't had their food, but now that I have tracked down this super awesome place I stumbled upon a while back, I can't wait to check it out again. Stay tuned for updated review! :)"}
{"text":"Lula is a local gem, maybe not of diamond level, but at least pearl. It's a cosy little place with a very limited but extremely high quality menu. The wine list is extremely well conceived, with surprisingly fair prices. The food consists of appetizers and small plates, so it's really not a great dinner restaurant. Big appetite folks will be disappointed, but if you're looking for a great place to share a bottle of wine and a light meal, Lula is perfect."}
{"text":"The first thing to come to my attention as I stepped into Lula was the ambiance of the small tapas bar nestled in a small corner of Selwickley.  I was greeted by the kindest of bar staff who explained what could be sampled at this little eatery by the river.
I started with the carrot and curry soup which was warm and inviting...the spices and flavor came pleasured my palate with a subtleness that was both relaxing and reassuring....I was sure everything was going to be fine...a wonderful trait to find in a vegetarian soup. 
As \"Dont you want me\" by The Human League played I tried the Armadillo Eggs and Plantain nachos and never looked back.
Lula stole my heart....one tapas at a time."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place but I left disappointed. Good location. Indoor and outdoor seating. Staff and management was friendly. But unfortunately the food was lacking. Went for lunch and the chicken sandwich was recommended. The orzo was pretty bland and the chicken had no flavor."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and tasty food.  Prices are a little high but the quality and quantity of food is good.  They were out of a few items tonight though which was disappointing.  Overall, good experi ence for a first visit."}
{"text":"Since my last review was turned down by yelp lets try again; It's been a while since we ventured to Sewickley for a meal, best way to describe Lola is an over priced version of Ave B but with less than perfect preparation and very few local choices. Server was surprised there was such a  thing as a \"red zinfandel\" so obviously the pairing question was a bad one. 

Appetizers were OK, We enjoyed the ambiance, place was dead for  Saturday night.  left most of the food on our plates, left a small tip and went home."}
{"text":"This place is really fantastic. 

The in-laws recommended we stop by during our yearly Christmas trip back to Sewickley. 

They bill their portions as tapas sized - but I would certainly say these were WAY bigger than your standard DC $14 for 3 shrimp serving size. Three items were more than enough for two. 

The antipasto plate was huge, and amazing - def start with this. Also had the scallops with lobster butter which were perfect. Very nice wine by the glass selection.

Also, the service was great - the owner came over and delivered additional scallops (because he thought the others looked a little too small) -- gimmick or not, it was a really nice touch and something you'll not gonna find in many places.

This is a must go if you are in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Really loved this place. Food was VERY good. Wine was excellent too, 2013 Scaia Dei Garnatxa. Ordered the asparagus and salmon, olives, humus, filet, almonds and cheese and ham but croquettes were AMAZING. Everything was fantastic. Wine was perfect with it all. Atmosphere is a little loud but was a fun environment with great singer playing in the background. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"What a great find in the village of Sewickley. Very nicely decorated . Wait staff friendly and inviting. Had the turkey sliders delicious and the barratta and crostinis very good. I would definitely recommend whether for dinner or for a light lunch like we had"}
{"text":"I was so excited to check this place out with my husband on a date night...We drove from Pine Township and was surprised is was fairly empty. We eagerly awaited our waitress and she informed us that we would have to eat our meal in a cramped corner to leave all booths open in case it got busy (6pm) That would be okay, but they had zero reservations and every other spot was open other than the bar. I said okay we can leave. The snotty waitress lost a good tip and continued customer due to being RUDE. Should have stayed at Off The Hook in wexford. I will be sure to spread the word that Lula rather have zero business than 2"}
{"text":"'Twas a beautiful evening when my friend and I wandered into Lula's.  The Tapas idea attracted us, because if we didn't like the first courses, we could just leave with minimal financial commitment.

And thank God.

I got the Fig Toast and my friend the Stuffed Peppers.  The fig toast were overall okay, but not worth the $10 price tag for four bites.  The bread was barely toasted and room-temperature.  Jam and cheese were both good, but that was the only good part.  The figs were tiny and preserved, and not the good preserved kind either.  The were dry and fig-newtonesque.  It was all tied together with a balsamic reduction that overpowered everything.

My friend got the stuffed peppers.  These were the real disappointment. The were no better than frozen ones you could buy at Costco.  Undersalted, overcooked, and no flavor to speak of.  The beef stuffing was tough and gray.  The plate was doused in a tomato sauce.  Either it was canned or the chef has never heard of salt.

Luckily we were able to get out of there with only $20 down the drain.  This place is a money pit, beware."}
{"text":"This is an great eclectic place to have wine and Tapas. Filet, scallops and cheese plates are first class. A little pricey but worth it for the quality of the food. Great experience. Our server, Chris, was wonderful. They also served hot chocolate with alcohol during Light Up Night that was the best I ever had. Thanks for the wonderful experience. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Lula is a place of aspiration: trying to be something soigne in a town of strivers. You have to admire their firm adherence to pretension, however."}
{"text":"Ambiance here was fabulous.  My fiancee and I went here for dinner--our waiter was very friendly and helpful with tapas selections.  Our food was brought out one tapas at a time, which was conducive to fully enjoying the unique dishes that Lula had to offer.  The scallops were so tender, as well as the lamb.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"From me as a food blogger: DON'T MISS THIS ONE!!  Located In the former \"Naked Grape\" site. I was early so I sat outside at one of the sidewalk tables and met Katherine (a local) who had nothing but good to say about the food!! Inside:  What a difference!! Decorating is excellent as is ambiance. Service is excellent. My waiter (Richard) was very attentive, helpful and sincerely interested in the patrons.
++I had the Portabella Mushroom Sandwich (Sauteed portabella cap stuffed with spinach, marinated tomatoes, manchego cheese and topped with pistachio pesto). Excellent even though a tiny bit messy. But worth it!!
++ With the sandwich I had the Lula Chopped Salad with the Herb Vinaigrette Dressing (awesome - I love citrus and this dressing had lemon, lime, orange, basil, olive oil and a tad of salt - I am going to try and replicate it at home!!).
++For take-out dessert I had the Tiramisu (excellent and the best I have ever had). It had a topping, I believe, of a coffee flavor). 
Met the owner Mr. Fernandez. He took the time to stop at each table to say hello.
The chef is Amy Wander and she's gets it!! Quelle gourmet!!"}
{"text":"This place had a very quiet and small dining area when you first walk in. The wine list had several  different wines but they are very expensive. We each ordered a glass of Chardonnay which came to $10 per glass but they were mostly half glasses. The menu has about 20 items to choose from but once again very pricey for tapas plates.

We ordered the hummus, meatballs, duck and fish tacos. The plates had plenty of food for tapas style but each dish was around $15 per plate. Each dish had very different sauces that were either too sweet or not enough. The quality of the meats were just average. Definitely not worth the $75 bill for 4 plates and 2 glasses of wine. I would not recommend this place, much better places in sewickley to choose from."}
{"text":"This place was really cute inside! Cozy tables and chairs and decor. We went in on a fairly slow night so we had good conversation and very friendly service. 

We got a bunch of plates to share including: The pork belly bruschetta which was good but the pork belly was very tough. We also got the roasted winter vegetables which were delicious. We also got the Seabass and lobster plate ... again very tasty but the lobster was overlooked and tough as nails. 

Overall there were good flavors but the execution wasn't consistent among the plates or on the bites on each plate. We will give it another chance!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late lunch on a Saturday.  We ordered the cheeseburger and the turkey sliders. The burger was done as ordered and was very good. It was juicy and tasty. Plus it was proportioned perfectly to the bun. My girlfriend ordered the turkey sliders and said they were excellent.  If you're in Sewickley this is a quaint little restaurant that is worth trying."}
{"text":"I rarely go to Sewickley for dining but suggested to my friend that we check out one of the restaurants there for dinner last Friday night.  She chose Lula and am I ever happy that she did.  This small wine and tapas bar is absolutely lovely inside - very intimate and stylish yet comfy and welcoming - it lacked the pretentiousness that one might find at a similar type of restaurant in other cities (or even in Shadyside).  I felt right at home on the bench seating along the front wall which was adorned with beautiful drapery and the wood beam ceilings and dark wood bar with the eclectic lighting overhead all lent to the ambiance.  There was also a row of seating to the left along the wall with stylish settees which I would have loved to sit at had they not all been occupied.  

The wine list had a fair amount of reasonably priced wines by the glass.  And the tapas menu was about a page long with a range of options at mid-range to a little pricey.  My friend and I shared the Burrata plate, the roasted seasonal veggies, the salmon cakes, and the fig tostata plate.  All were delicious but as it can be with tapas sometimes you are left wanting just a bit more food for the price.  Overall I loved the food and the ambiance.  I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Lula has a very cool, boho vibe- it's different and cozy.. A great place to stop for a drink or two. The small plates my husband and I have tried range from olives to hummus and shrimp- all have been good- not out of this world, but good. It can turn into an expensive evening if you stick around but for happy hour or while waiting for your reservation elsewhere, Lula is great- BTW: my husband RAVED about his \"extra dirty\" martini, best one he's had!"}
