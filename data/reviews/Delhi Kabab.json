{"text":"Do not go to this restaurant, we got food poisoning there. We ordered one of their combo specials, it tasted fine, until both my boyfriend and I stayed up vomiting all night. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Restaurant tout nouveau un peu perdu parmi les autres commerces de ce mini centre commercial bordant Taschereau. Dès l'entrée le décor charme: c'est mignon et pas trop kitsch comme certains restos indiens.

Nous sommes allés à quatre (toujours l'idéal dans ce type de resto, cela permet de partager plusieurs plats et de goûter à beaucoup de choses) et avons été chaudement accueilli par le proprio. Nous avons commandé un combo pour 4 personnes. La nourriture était excellente: poulet au beurre (bien sûr!) bien crémeux et rempli de saveurs, des crevettes bien cuites/juteuses, etc. Bref, c'était parfaitement à la hauteur de nos attentes pour une bonne bouffe indienne un lundi soir :)

Le +++++: Le service! Peut-être est-ce dû à leur récente ouverture, mais le service était PLUS qu'impeccable. Rarement me suis-je attablée à un restaurant où le serveur prend la peine de mettre la serviette de tables sur les genoux de chacun et où le proprio aide à mettre le manteau aux dames à la fin du repas. J'espère que le bouche-à-oreille fonctionnera, car ce resto vaut vraiment la peine d'être essayé."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal here. Not the most authentic that you are going to get, but one of the better Indian/Bangladeshi(?) restos on the South Shore.  As another poster said, the service was definitely a notch above what you'd expect without being pretentious either. It is also true that a lot of the dishes and condiments here are heavily sweetened and Westernized (and very mild!!) but nothing is forcing you to order Butter chicken or Tikka masala either.   
We appreciated that every dish we had here had a totally different flavor profile. In so many Indian restos, especially here on the Shore , all the dishes taste practically the same, like they have the same base. Not to mention that dishes are so often overladen with heavy cream. Anyway, Keep up the good work, Delhi kabab."}
{"text":"Authentic Indian food, clean place with nice service ... The Baryani is woooow and Nan is amazing . One of few in Montreal or near to Montreal where you can have that authenticity and quality of food"}
{"text":"We ordered the menu for 4 and our kids really enjoyed the dinner. Delicious Naan and not too spicy food. Extremely friendly staff. I would absolutely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Tres bon repas aux saveurs harmonieuses avec un service rempli de gentillesse par surcroit. Nous y reviendrons !"}
{"text":"I ordered the butter chicken, chicken bryani, chicken tandoori, samosas both veggie and meat and some naan. I asked for everything to be very spicy but since the meats are prepared in advance he said he'll give me the house spicy sauce on the side. It was definitely spicy and I enjoyed it a lot.

Butter chicken was sweeter than I'm used to and more watery than usual as well but it was good nonetheless just different.
Chicken bryani was good, meat was a little dry but it was good.
Chicken tandoori was really good. One of the best I've ever had.
The samosas were tasty and flakey. Enjoyed it a lot.

So all in all everything was good but the tandoori chicken really gave everything a boost."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I have ever try in greater montreal area.
Food is soooo delicious
Service is excellent
Price is cheap compare to the service, amount of food.
Place is fabulous.

I would recommend anybody to try"}
{"text":"Spectacular. The best tandoori I have ever had. I went with my family, and everyone enjoyed their meal. The tandoori was amazing, I had the sampler platter, and was planning a n sharing my shrimp - I do not like shrimp - but the flavor they put on the meat was so good I ate all of it. The server was the best server in all of Canada - on time, charismatic and extremely funny. A great experience with spectacular food. 5/5 would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"reasonable priced and very generous portions for Indian cuisine! I am so happy with this find! the shahi paneer is indulging! My go to- this place is a South Shore star- a must try!"}
{"text":"C'était un superbe repas.  Excellent  Service tout était propre.  Je reviendrais sûrement."}
{"text":"This is the top ranked restaurant bar none for Brossard (on another review site).

It does not disappoint on either food or service.
It's a family owned place that treats it's guests wonderfully.

It was my little sister's birthday and while we can eat Indian food anytime we want, it's normally the service that prevents us from doing it for special occasions. 

We had three table d'hôte ($15 lunch and $20 for dinner)
The butter chicken was very mild and creamy,  the lamb curry was very spicy (as requested) 

All the veggie dishes and naan were awesome.

I had the mixed grill plate that comes sizzling hot, various meats and awesome jumbo shrimp ($23 with small rice and salad).


Mahbub and family really made it a wonderful trip for us.

And it's only 10 minutes from downtown"}
{"text":"En premier lieu, le service. Impeccable, délicate attention.

Le repas, pargait, le poulet au beurre, délicieux, un must

Dommage qu'il soit si discret, il gagne vraiment à être connu!"}
{"text":"Westernized Indian food.

Tucked away on boul. Taschereau in a strip mall, the inside of Delhi Kabab reveals a very neat and polished interior. Waiter greats in fluent English and French. Yes, the service is excellent and the cleanliness of the place is several notches above typical establishments in the ghetto. But that's worth at most one extra star for me.

I ordered a chicken tikka masala with a naan bread. To be fair, the waiter did warn me that it was sweeter than normal, but it was so buttery, sweet, and un-spicy that it could have been a butter chicken for all intents and purposes. The lack of spices (not just piquant) was disconcerting. The chicken itself wasn't the most tender but was acceptable. The dish was also quite small for the price paid ($13.49). The naan bread was much better executed. You can see that it's huge; it's also fluffy and crispy as it should be. However, the bowl of chicken masala was dry before the whole naan was finished.

I don't rate food on what language the waiter speaks. There is some refinement in terms of service and the peripheral elements, but I personally think you ought to stick to Parc-Ex for authentic flavours and for better quality-price. Or perhaps you should stick with butter chicken as the reviewers on the French side recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant satisfies two of my addictions: spice and spicy.
I have ordered take-out from DK 4 or 5 times and every time I am impressed by the price and the flavours.

My go to is their beef vinaloo. It is not for the faint of heart or tongue. Do not order it if you do not REALLY TRULY DEEPLY love spicy food. It is incredible. With chunks of tender beef, rich sauce and a fair amount of veggies, when I crave it no other beef vindaloo will do.

Their samosas are also delicious. I would recommend the meat vs the veggie samosas only because I find the meat have a very unique taste vs other samosas I have had. The meat is ground and spiced so well that it's hard to eat just one order (2 pieces) they come with a nice simple salad too which is a bonus.

I have also had their saag dishes, although I find them to be salty if you eat them with some of the other dishes they are very delicious. 

The other item that I find unique about DK is their butter chicken which is actually too mild for my tastes, but my bf loves it and it is extremely creamy!

Overall I always recommend this restaurant and it is definitely worth making the trip over the bridge is you live on the island. I'm a big value for money person and DK satisfies everything I want every time! Love them!

15% discount for take-out orders! Hells yeah!"}
{"text":"Belle découverte!!
Nous avons essayé le menu table d'hôte. Je n'aime pas les papadum normalement mais ceux la, avec les 3 sauces en accompagnements, m'ont fait changé d'idée! Les badjis en entrées étaient parfaits, goûteux et croustillants!
Le poulet au beurre délicieux, avec assez de sauce pour napper le riz et/ou tremper le naan (nous avons commander un naan en extra pour avoir les deux). Le riz est très bon, avec safran et petits oignons frits. Les naans sont fameux!! Pour les légumes en accompagnements, personnellement j'aurais préféré des légumes valeurs ou sautés au beurre, sans pois chiches ou épices.
Le pouding au riz goûtait un peu trop l'eau de rose pour mon goût personnel. Mon conjoint a adoré son dessert, une boule de fromage frite dans un sirop, servie froide.
Le service était impeccable: attentionné (les serviettes déposées sur nos genoux!), en français parfait, souriant et comique! 
Nous y retournerons pour tester d'avantage le menu, c'est certain!"}
{"text":"Visited recently on a Sunday evening for a family dinner after hearing about it from a friend. Good thing we reserved in advance because there wouldn't have been any space for us otherwise! 

We ordered the BB combo ($43 for 2 people), table d'hote ($20/person) and the chicken tikka masala curry ($14). It's a cute place that caters to mostly Canadians, which explains why their food is so mild. 

*Tip; if like us you can handle a little bit of spice, make sure to ask the waiter for some of their homemade hot sauce. I didn't get to try it but I'll make sure to ask for some the next time! 

I tried a little bit of everything (onion bhaji, sheekh kabab, pakora, papadom, naan bread, rice, chick peas, beef bhouna, chicken curry, chicken tandoori, etc.) The appetizers were all good but they put A LOT of clarified butter on their naan so make sure to ask for no butter if you'd rather yours dry. The rice was aromatic and more interesting than simple white rice. My favourite dishes would have to be the chick peas and chicken tikka masala. The sheekh kabab was delicious. We were also served rice pudding and fried cheese balls for dessert. I didn't like either but then again, I don't like Indian desserts in general. 

The waiter was friendly and efficient. At around $27 per person, I would probably go back if I got an Indian food craving in Brossard."}
{"text":"Found this great little place with Yelp!! Cosy, great bilingual (English and French but likely speak one or more Indian dialects!!) service with a smile and tasty food! We shared one \"table d'hôte\" menu and one Biryanis rice and didn't even have room for dessert! And we had a doggy bag of delicious leftovers for the next day! I'm ALMOST, NOT quite, but almost ready for the cold weather when I think of Delhi Kebab! Namaste"}
{"text":"My friends and I had a great experience here last weekend. One of my friends is vegan and the waiter was attentive, funny and highly accommodating. They have a number of vegetarian options, which my friend thought she could eat, but our waiter diligently went out back to the kitchen to double check before we even asked. Often, we would be wrong and there'd be a little bit of non-vegan in the food, so he saved my friend from getting sick! 

Apart from that, the food was delicious, none of us wanted to stop eating, from coconut-based dishes to tikki-masala, to naan to the amazing lentil soup - it was all great!"}
{"text":"Looking for an Indian restaurant on the south shore is not an easy task.  Came across this one by surprise, and as the window sign says Kebab, one would not typically think of Indian food. 

Tried their thali for lunch and the food was good, but not great.  I was expecting something more with a punch. 

May come back again to try another dish before I can cast my final vote.  

I am always happy to see white table cloth and a nice decor that earned one star."}
{"text":"Living not too far from Delhi Kabab, we pass the restaurant often but only now did we decide to try it out (terrible I know).
For some reason, we have this impression that none of the Indian restaurants in the South Shore are genuine so always travel to areas that specialise in the cuisine. After a dear Yelper's suggestion (Norine!) and checking out reviews, we finally decided to try it out!

I have to say - I truly was surprised. The place is lovely and cosy inside with a super neat and tidy interior. We were given complimentary poppadum's with delicious condiments whilst we waited for our order. The menu is bilingual and has a lot of choice - especially vegetarian options!
 We had the chicken pakoras for starters followed by the house special fried rice, lamb karahi and naan for mains. The pakoras were OK - not the best but still tasty. Our main course was super delicious - the lamb karahi was divine, so many flavours and very different to karahi's I have had in the past. Spice level was perfect for us and the hot buttery naan just melted in the mouth. The karahi took some time to come, which is a good sign as it is a long dish to prepare. Great big portion enough for two and they sure didn't cheap out on the amount of lamb.

Very very impressed by the taste and quality of the food, the cleanliness and behaviour of the staff. They were always prompt in refilling our glasses of water, very kind and hospitable.
Definitely one of South-Shore's gems - will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazingly awesome. We got there just 30 minutes before they closed with a big group of 12 ppl. The Staff were super accommodating and patient they served all the dishes that we asked for without refusing to cook in the last minute. The Rotis, the curries and the Biriyani were cooked to perfection and perfect mix of spices. We were surprised to find this great Indian restaurant in Montreal. Will definitely recommend to anyone willing to try Indian food, and will go back there next time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant last night and was not disappointed. Nice Decor. Good pricing & Good portions. Great service from our waiter when asked for suggestion about good vegetarian dish. On top of that, the food was very delicious. We tried vegetable samosas, Vegetable Korma, Malai Kofta, Mushroom fried rice, Naan bread. Located near mall  The place is a bit small but great for a date night. This restaurant also offers delivery near Brossard & Saint-Hubert or you can call for pick-up if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Incredible food great service must try this place best Indian food I've ever had. Not you average Indian food."}
{"text":"With our favorite Indian joint in Verdun closed for the day, we expanded our radius and tried Delhi Kebab on Taschereau.

We had the classics - butter chicken, samosas, rice, naan bread (traditional, cheese and garlic) and chicken kebabs.

I'll put it this way: everything is good. We weren't blown away by anything but it was all right. The butter chicken is a bit bland, i.e. boring.

We all wished the cooks had used more spices. I eat Indian for the excitement in my mouth, not for another OK  meal. 

Verdict: it was ok, I'd have it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back, which is a bit disappointing to say given the many great options for Indian in Montreal."}
{"text":"Amaijing food coma back again . Last week I went delhi Kabab with my family. Food was very good.My son like very much tandoori chiken"}
{"text":"Prices range from 20-35$ person for a full meal.

This little cosy restaurant was located a 5minutes walk from home and boy was I missing something.

Great flavours and presentation. The tandoori shrimp are amazing!  Many jumbo shrimps. 

The place is super clean and well kept.

The waiters are nice and give you water regularly."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Saturday And the restaurant was empty! I was craving Indian food so when hubby took me here I was really happy...until we got our food. First off, I'm a big fan of thali. The waiter kindly told me that they do not offer thali on the weekends (sad). So we opted for the lunch special that consist of an appetizer, a main and a dessert. The food wasn't bad... it just tasted like they flavoured it with those fluorescent yellow powdered chicken bouillon that you would get in bulk. Not something I enjoy tasting so much. It was literally in every plates! The service was ok. Slow, disorganized but courteous none the less. Next time I'll have a craving, I'll go somewhere else. Sorry!!"}
