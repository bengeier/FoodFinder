{"text":"Torii @ Lavel, Quecec, Canada, ???  2131 Boulevard Le Carrefour, Laval, QC H7S 2J7  We fame to here for dinner since location is in the distance walkable. In contrast to not-so much impressive outside, inside is very much stylish and entertain us. Menus are Sushi and combination plate mainly and they do not have Donbri, noodles etc. Taste is fair for us Japanese tourist.  ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ????????????????????????????????????????????????  ????????????  ????????????????OK?????  ???????????????????????????????????????  ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ????????????????"}
{"text":"Was in Laval on business and this place was close to the hotel.  I have to admit that living in Vancouver, I'm used to cheap AND good sushi.  In the rest of Canada, it's one or the other it seems.  Torii had a fairly decent menu selection.  It's your standard sashimi and nigiri selections and the rolls you're used to at any other sushi joint.  The fish seemed fairly fresh.  (for fish in a landlocked city)  Presentation was nice but it was a bit on the pricier side when compared to Vancouver, which to be honest, I can't really fault them for.  The service was fairly good though I was hoping they would come refill my drinks more often than just twice during my meal.  With so much other unique foods in Montreal, I'm not sure I'd make another stop here next time around."}
{"text":"Its over rated. I've had better maki in all you can eat restaurants ! Didn't try plates on the menu so I don't know if there are good or not ... I don't know :-/ but definitely not the place for sushi/maki !"}
{"text":"The Maki rolls were great. Real crunch where it needed to be. Staff is friendly and knows the food well. Readily accomodates food allergy requests. Atmosphere is casual and friendly."}
{"text":"PROS: 1. Decor is nice. Love the hanging lanterns.  2. The seafood soup was light and deeelicious. The sashimi, sushi, and maki were well made and presented.  CONS: 1. A bit pricey for what it's worth.  OVERALL: -Not a terrible or outstanding place for sushi. So-so. I would go here if I'm in Laval and craving sushi otherwise I wouldn't make an effort to go to Torii."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. My Tokyo Bento consisted of a small miso soup, shrimps & vegetables tempura, grilled chicken, sauteed vegetables and rice. The miso soup was decent, the shrimp and vegetables tempura was good. The main course of chicken wasn't good. It was moist but held almost no flavor. How is that possible? The sauteed vegetables found under where chicken rested were overdone and tasted only of soy sauce and salt. On the side I had a total of 5 mushrooms, they were OK.  The price-tag is pretty expensive for what you get. The small soup and Bento platter didn't fill me up and set me back almost $19 before taxes on a weekday lunch. This is clearly not competitive to other sushi places in this area where I can get all you can eat sushi for $14, how exactly can one justify a gastronomic single plate of $19?  No thanks.  If you're the kind of person who likes to eat in pretty places that focuses in its esthetic and not so much in its food then Torii Sushi is for you. Not for me though."}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese Maki, sushi and sashimi, not the adapted version. Loved the miso soup too on a cold day. $50 for 2 Ã  la carte, i consider it fair value against the dishes. Will come again. Ambiance so so and we didn't bring beer or wine and couldn't buy in house either. It was a bday celebration but the restaurant didn't bother lit up a candle. So one star off for servitude."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Homarius and the tatare are so good ! Whenever i go there im always satisfied with their service and the quality of the food ! Their personalised service makes a difference ! And also its bring your own wine !"}
{"text":"I was pretty surprised by some great sushi places in Laval, so I decided to give this one a chance as well.   We came here for dinner and we decided to get a salad, 3 rolls, and 2 nigiri. The wait time was pretty long, despite the few diners in the restaurant, and the waiter seldom checked in on us.   The baby octopus salad with seaweed was my favourite in this meal. It had a beautiful presentation, and I was able to even enjoy the slices of strawberry and mango, and I usually don't like fruit in my salads.  After what seemed like 20-30 minutes, we finally got our main course. The rolls were pretty bland in my opinion, and the most offending thing was the watered down soy sauce that tasted like it was diluted with salt water. And with all that, we ended up with a bill of $76 after tip and taxes.  I gave this place a two star rating for their salad and the quality of fish, which was surprisingly fresher than I thought. I don't think I'll be back, it would take a lot for me to come back to this place."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd stop in the place, the 1st time was take out.  The food was over-priced, and the quality of food is very poor.  My roommates make better sushi than them.  I also tipped poorly based on the service, and the manager came after me after I walked away and told me the way i tip was not accepted.  He went on and on about I need to tip 10% no matter what happens, then i told him I wrote down my order I got my own check then why would i tip someone 15% for doing nothing.    The food was not good as well, so I especially don't appreciate his condescending tone with me, after I already walked away.  What a bully!  No wonder my table was the only customers the whole night, I thought the service was terrible.  I watched the waiter/sushi makers chit chat the whole night, when I waited for food and my check."}
{"text":"Good food and good service! Sushi was decent  and the portions were quite  big. I especially loved the house specials the Cajun salmon was one to mention.  The atmosphere is nothing special and doesn't do the food justice.  This will definitely be a repeat for me!"}
{"text":"Great place, very nice decor. Sushi is typical of a upscale sushi place. Not the best I have tried. I never seen this restaurant full, however even if the restaurant is empty service is really slow. It's not my first choice for sushi, but if I am not downtown montreal i'd go here."}
{"text":"Decided to come here with another Yelper Jason for lunch one cloudy day. The place looked promising however when opening the menu pricing was quite steep. $16 for a sushi lunch plate?!?! I know this is not Vancouver or Toronto but there is no need to charge that much. Actually there is a need, It's called profit and it usually turns me away from a restaurant. I will pay more for food if it's exceptional quality however this was not.   For my lunch I had selected the salmon bento. It came with tempura vegetables, a scoop of rice, some potato salad mix, fried mushrooms and the salmon was on a bed of carrot and cabbage fried mix. Plus a miso soup. All in all for $18.50. The more humorous thing was the bento was not even in a bento box. I was thinking why call it a bento if it's served on a plate? I asked the server as to why this was and he said \"it's too hard for people to eat from\". Really? seriously? Lol! So as I was eating my salmon I had noticed the middle was seriously undercooked. Like raw! I myself prefer more medium rare cooked salmon.  However you don't know or can trust a restaurants food handling. So I showed my server who looked surprised. I asked if the salmon was fresh or frozen. He mentioned frozen and thawed. He offered another piece. I told him I didn't want another piece and I went to eat around the raw middle. From cooking salmon much at home I know that the center of a thick cut usually takes much longer to cook. So at home I never cook thick pieces! The funny thing is he didn't really look too apologetic. Good thing I didn't get sick but if you have a sensitive stomach you may not fare as well.   You only have one chance to make a first impression. My impression of this place is overpriced VERY EXPENSIVE faux Japanese food. Lots of cheap filler on the plate. Oh yes and raw salmon! The bill came at full price I tipped minimally and won't be back.   Slightly over $20 after tax and tip for this?   Seriously people there are better places to eat at."}
{"text":"Not sure if they have an expanded menu for dinner, the specials menu for dinner has some very interesting and deliciois choices including maki with onion and bacon tempura.  I haven't seen sushi like this anywhere else and am happy to have found it here.  And perhaps some of the menu should be called delicious food served maki style.  The more traditional items such as scallop nigiri was very good too.  The only negative was slow service by american business traveler standards but free wifi from neighboring restaurant helped with that."}
{"text":"I'm from LA this was really good sushi Really cool idea to keep your saki warm.  I had rolls and eel and maguro. Proper sized sushi.   Try it you will like it"}
{"text":"Came here for a group dinner. Looks like some of the speciality items were good but we were encouraged to order from the set menu which was pretty standard and massively overpriced. We were told it was ok to bring kids but they did not seem very kid friendly. To top things off, we went back to the car and had been broken into! Parking is not safe here! Would not go back."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor but overrated and overpriced food.  As per the server's recommendation, we ordered the tuna and salmon tataki, the tuna/salmon tartare and either the dragon or the dragonball.  All three dishes were forgettable. All tasted bland and covered with the same overly sweet brown teriyaki like sauce.   I'd recommend this restaurant to a novice sushi eater."}
{"text":"This place has some incredible rolls.  The Sexy Cucu is wrapped in cucumber and there's one for dessert with fresh strawberry that tastes like some magical combination between sushi and a funnel cake.  The owner is also a huge fan of San Francisco and loves Slanted Door.  Gotta love that."}
