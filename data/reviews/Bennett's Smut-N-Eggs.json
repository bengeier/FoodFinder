{"text":"uhhhhhh. Only in...Wisconsin? Only in *Madison*, Wisconsin.  Its super fun to watch people fuck while you stuff your face with wet, meaty breakfast tacos and shit."}
{"text":"Sadly - Bennett's (on Park) - which served up \"Smut-N-Eggs\" has closed. It was a great place in its day with neighborhood people who were really nice. The food was quite good too. I was more of a regular years ago for beer and darts. (Back when the dollars were on the ceiling still!). 

Not sure about the place that moved into this location- but we will miss Bennett's!"}
