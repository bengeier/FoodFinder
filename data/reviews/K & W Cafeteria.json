{"text":"The food is great, tons of choices, the employees are always so friendly!  This place is great and fairly cheap. They also do take out, even for special holiday meals. If your holiday plans have changed with passing loved ones or kids who have moved far you can come here for a meal and they will make you feel right at home!"}
{"text":"I love to eat here, the only thing I wish they would change is their tipping policy, the waitress's cannot be tipped on your bill, only by leaving money on the table and being they only make $2.49 an hour I think the owners should make an attempt to change this. They work very hard to serve their customers well!"}
{"text":"Awful! They use to have a \"To go\" door you could just pop in and get something to go. They would have a couple of runners that would fill your \"to go\" box and out you go. That is gone away and you have to go around and stand in line. So I stand in line and order Grilled Chicken - \"15 minutes\", Grilled Sirloin - \"20 minutes\". Are you kidding? You already wasted my time by making me stand in line. I'm getting it \"to go\". Now you want me to stand in line and wait 20 minutes. They just don't get it. I just walked out and went down the street. I was sitting at Outback with a steak in front of me in 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I visited here with my mom on Saturday around noon. First the parking lot is a little tight you're always scrambling to find a spot. The lines move at a good speed. The waitresses down there suck. You normally have to get your own refills. You constantly hear the waitresses talking about customers not leaving tips but they don't deserve anything. The food isn't seasoned much but that's ok still a good taste. Overall I would go back."}
{"text":"Always good food and friendly staff. I went there once a week while my kitchen was being redone. Consistently good and the next best thing to a home cooked meal."}
{"text":"Great place to order foods for family gatherings or any time you need to take food. Have been ordering.the coconut cake for several years. Last year it was huge and so delicious!  Cost then was $12.99! Have not ordered yet this year but in the past management and staff were extremely helpful andI I could not ask for better service."}
{"text":"Nasty nasty nasty. Salad was brown and slimy.  Then I found a hair in my food. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Better than average unit in the K&W chain.  

For those who have never experience a K&W meal, it is cafeteria style with the walk past and select to the servers. Lots of choices, and food all good. Good value for good food. 

One thing I especially appreciate about K&W is their no tipping policy. This is proof that a successful restaurant chain can operate and actually pay their help to perform the services without reliance on customer tips."}
{"text":"1st time in Charlotte. I frequented this type of restaurant quite often growing up in VA, so I wasn't expecting nothing fancy. Everything was pretty good. The prices are very reasonable. We were serviced by a lovely older lady peridiocally when beverage refills were needed.The ambiance was family friendly. The staff were very nice and courteous. My kids loved the interaction with everyone. I would come back when in town."}
{"text":"Had lunch here over the weekend with my father-in-law and husband. 
Things I like about K&W. 

1. You get to see what you're ordering before you order it. 
2. Service- The staff is usually courteous and super friendly. 
3.Food- It's no 5 star restaurant but it's decent southern fried, stick to your ribs food. 
4. Price - 3 people can easily eat here for under $30

The waitresses are usually overworked here. I highly recommend that if you are eating here and you receive good service to leave a decent tip. The staff is usually older and they pride themselves on their work. I say this because my husband witnessed some guests being rude to one of the waitresses and he left her a larger tip on purpose for what she was having to put up with."}
{"text":"We are enjoying our second trip to this K&W. Nice experience, clean heavily used location. Staff is very helpful and serve generous portions. K&W serves regional food cooked simply but we'll. Chicken livers were nicely done, well cleaned before they were fried excellent simple Mac and cheese, disappointed in the spinach pie, tough crust and for my taste under seasoned. Table service was excellent frequent checks to be sure we were doing well.
Overall a very good experience for a cafeteria style setting."}
{"text":"Love the fried chicken light & crispy, and the vegetables are fresh. The salmon actually I really like every thing!! The prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"I love K & W Cafeteria in Concord NC,  however, today I ordered two To-Go meals.  They skimped me!  I normally check my boxes, but today I didn't.  Turkey and Dressing  (2 very thin slices) and Baked Spaghetti  (normally fills the larger portion of the carryout box). I want let that happen again."}
{"text":"I took my two youngest kids here today, as I rarely get to eat at a K&W, and I love it so much. This visit was definitely not the best. 

First of all, every single time I've visited this location there have been nasty people loitering all around the door. They're filthy, smoking and swearing, staring at my chest, and make me very nervous and uncomfortable. It says a lot about how much I love K&W that I would subject myself and my children to this more than once. I know this location is somewhat ghetto, but I don't even have to deal with that at Walmart or McDonald's! 


We visited after the lunch rush, at about 2pm. The food serving staff was splendid. Eager, polite, and focused. The manager happened to be helping out on the line and assisted us eagerly as well. The lady (who I don't think was a waitress) who rushed over to carry my 8 year old son's tray was a delight. Very funny and kind. Everyone on this end of the house had a great attitude and work ethic. 

The food:  was not top-notch at this visit, but unfortunately, I've noticed a decline in the quality with every visit. The chicken fingers on mine and my daughter's plates were dry and rubbery, and they've been changed from the style they used to have with the drive-45-minutes-out-of-my-way breading. Thankfully the honey mustard sauce was the same - yum! My mashed potatoes and gravy and both kids' okra were great, as were the blue Jell-O and my coconut cream pie. My daughter did not like the chocolate pudding. She said it was clumpy. Sweet tea was great as usual, but my son's glass of water tasted very strange (daughter agreed). Biscuit was delish, daughter's soft roll was burned on the bottom. 

Waitress kept us taken care of and glasses full. Very efficient but definitely not wordy - this is par for all the K&W waitresses I've had. 

Worst part of the visit (well, second worst after the strange men loitering) was checkout. The cashier was on her cell phone the whole time, and while she at least didn't carry on a conversation while ringing us up, she also didn't say a single word to us. No \"your total is__\" or \"how was your meal\" or \"thank you for choosing to spend your hard earned money here.\" Nothing. And also no receipt. I just kind of stood there with my mouth gaping as I turned and walked out. 

So, overall, I probably won't be back. Mostly because my craving for those insanely awesome chicken fingers can now never be quenched. So it's not really worth paying relatively high prices to a rude girl for cafeteria food after walking through a cloud of bums. 

It's really a shame, because I *want* to still love K&W. I really hope they get it together."}
{"text":"K  & W is one of those places that you might have to have special memories associated with eating here to eat here on the regular! Every time my grandmother or extended family comes to town we eat at the K & W. Cafeteria style and very southern food is what you'll find here. It's not fancy AT ALL, but that's not why I come. This reminds me of my childhood in Winston-Salem and I have fond memories of eating here on Sunday with my grandparents. I probably gain 5 pounds after a meal at the K & W, but it's worth it. I'll be back when grandmother comes to town next and I'll enjoy every moment of it!"}
{"text":"Love this place!
I ordered a catered meal for 12.
K & W.... Thank you for making my
dinner party successful! I will use you guys
again."}
{"text":"Good food. Service by and large pretty good. After all it is a cafeteria. 

Always a safe bet due to variety."}
{"text":"If you're new to Charlotte and want to see what Southern food consists of, K & W is the smörgåsbord!  Beyond the sterotypical fried chicken and collard greens, you'll get the idea of how our grandmas cooked.  The heat lamps and excessive seasoning puts a slight damper on taste, but it's better choice than Golden Corral or Shoneys.  *Shudder*

If I'm jonesing for some comfort food and sweet Southern hospitality, this place is it.  I'm a creature of habit, so I'll list some of my favs in no particular order:
-Roast beef (sliced when ordered) with au jus
-Mac n Cheese, homemade, baked, using slightly sharp cheese
-Garlic Texas Toast
-Chocolate Pie loaded with fresh-tasting whipped cream
-Glazed carrots (is there any other way?)

The line moves pretty fast, even at busy times.  You can expect the after-church crowd on Sundays, but its otherwise steady flow of traffic.  Hint: If you abhor the idea of cafeterias, this is NOT your restaurant.  But if you can stand a dozen sweet grannies asking \"What can I get you, hon?\" (which is about as intolerant as Sunday afternoon naps in my opinion), you're gonna love it!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of cafeteria food... I haven't been since elementary school. The lunch lady heavily resembled Buffalo Bill from Silence of The Lambs and her teeth glistened like freshly picked corn.

Nevertheless, that shouldn't sway my feeling about this genre of eatery. 

My wife likes to eat here and I try to be a good sport about it. But I still have a hard time selecting my food. Everytime I go, I try to get something different, so I can fairly evaluate this place but no matter what I get, it's generally not good... 
mac & cheese - bland but hot
chicken livers - not bad, needed some pepper for my taste.
spaghetto casserole - jesus couldn't help this dish. just sucked.
mash taters & gravy - pretty good.
fried chicken - edible but not much flavor

They do have a good variety of vegetables but I'm a carnivore for the most part.  (strike 1)
Everytime I go, there's always a lingering stench of dishwater on the service line. (strike 2)

Overall, not a bad place to go, if you're into the cafeteria thing but it's not for me. I know it's popular among the senior crowd. They're always are there in large groups.

Personally, I'd rather get cornholed by a silverback gorilla than eat here... but that's just my humble opinion... have a nice day~"}
{"text":"Pure food for the soul. Delicious for cafeteria food. Very tasty!  A great, comfortable place where you can relax and enjoy good, old fashioned comfort food."}
{"text":"If you don't like seasonings  or flavorful food this is definitely the place for you. Food taste pre chewed. First and last!"}
{"text":"Was a loyal customer for years. They treat you like garbadge. Aside from Larry the management here is very unprofessional and nasty"}
{"text":"I Love KNW. However with this visit the food was not that great.I requested dark dark meat fried chicken , subsequently served white meat fried chicken. I asked my server to return the fried chicken and requested bake dark read. I was told that there was no dark meat fried chicken. When I received my chicken it was baked beyond recognition. At that point I will I gave up continue to feast on my sides which is macaroni and cheese and broccoli and left the restaurant disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good Dutch apple pie. And friendly service. The prices are about what you'd pay at any other eating establishment that's fast food. However, you can enjoy your meal in a cozy sit down environment."}
{"text":"K&W can be a lot of fun if you're looking for comfort food. They cook like my mom and grandma...everything is southern, mushy, and well-seasoned. I love to get a sample of every vegetable on the line.

It's kind of reminiscent of elementary school cafeteria lines, which is always fun. The staff is very friendly and syrupy-sweet, which can be pretty nice. I think this is a great place to go if you're in the right mood for it. It can be a disaster if it's too busy or if you're not looking for a revisiting of your childhood days...especially when the place is really busy. Sometimes on Sunday afternoons, the church crowds can be overwhelming...but overall, it's a good, safe place for no-atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"I love going here for some good southern soul food.  It is set up like a traditional cafeteria, where you walk down a line and order each item individually.  I always order entirely too much by the end of the line, but I find somewhere to tuck it in my little belly.  The line cooks here are all sweethearts.  \"What can I get for ya honey?\" or maybe, \"You need to get a little more, you're a growing boy!\"  Well, I am twenty three, but I still get a kick out of it.  I wish all of these ladies where my grandmother.  Killer mac and cheese here, the key lime pie is nice too.  The crowd is mostly older, but it is an all around wholesome down-south experience."}
{"text":"This was the cutest place. Cafeteria style with a variety of southern dishes to choose from. Plus there are bus people that come and clear your dishes and refill your water. It is a relaxed atmosphere as it is mostly older individuals dining there."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at K&W.  I have patronized this restaurant for decades.  I still enjoy coming back for good cafeteria food.  The line always has a vast choice of food.  Their desserts are really good.  They sell whole cakes and pies to enjoy at home.  This is especially helpful around the holidays.  Their prices are reasonable. I think it's nice they still use cloth napkins."}
{"text":"K&W Cafeteria needs to be considered in the right light...it is cafeteria style, after all. So, don't go in there expecting a fancy feast with a fancy waitstaff and white linen service. That being said, this place is great for a dependable, fast, and incredibly affordable hot home style meal. 

The wait staff are always so sweet and friendly. Seriously, last night the power went out in my neighborhood so I took my son on a date to K&W and the staff was really lovely and helpful. My son is a toddler with the typical picky eating habits and he loves this place b/c there are so many options for him to choose from. Anyways, I mentioned in passing to the waiter that our power had gone out and he plugged my mobile phone in to charge it while we ate since it was low on power and I couldn't charge it at home. Additionally, he got on his phone and researched nearby places where I might be able to get a generator. Such a sweet guy and these folks are not necessarily tipped in the same way a waiter/waitress would be at a more typical restaurant. I think they split the tips at the end of a shift b/c mult. different people will help to clear your table throughout the meal. 

K&W is always clean and the food is reliably good. What's most remarkable is how much food you get for so little money - wow! Go in and check it out, you may find that you really enjoy it. It's a fantastic alternative option to your average sit down restaurant and it's lightning fast with all of the food already prepared. Definitely worth a try!!"}
{"text":"I freak in love this place the food is great the service is great! I took family there from up north and they loved it too great home cooked food the best"}
{"text":"Food Ivan be good but is hit and miss.  We have ate at many K&W locations before and the service at this location is by far the worst we experienced.  Someone came by as we were sitting down and never returned.   Much like the wait staff, we will not return."}
{"text":"Ate here with my Mom, Sister and other family members Easter Sunday.
Even though the place was packed, the serving line moved at a steady pace. The server that waited on our section, always kept our tea and coffee full and checked on us often.
The food was good, but the prices have risen to the point that a cafeteria is just not the bargain it used to be.
I started with deviled eggs and got just 2 halves for $1.40. A fried chicken breast added another $3.40, and with mashed potatoes and gravy, a roll, a piece of pie, and a glass of tea with tax pushed my bill just north of $10.
It was not that long ago that meal would have been in the $6-$7 range.
I noticed that the last time my wife and ate together at a cafeteria, our meals that used to cost us around $14 has now risen to close to $20.
Like I said the food was good, not great and does not justify the higher prices."}
{"text":"This was my first time actually eating at K&W cafeteria. My mother has been a fan of this eatery for a very very long time.  

I was really surprised at the prices there! Not in a good way. I paid nearly $10 for just a small piece of salmon and a half a cup of collard greens. No drink!  

I believe they must offer a senior citizen discount or something. Because there were so many seniors there. If anyone is ever looking to reach the senior market... It would be silly not to stop at K&W.  

The food was decent, but nothing exceptionally memorable.  The waitress was very friendly, and was the best part of our visit.  The bathrooms were clean.  My sister got free refills on her sweet tea, so that was good.

We had an unwelcome guests at our table. An ant!  That disgusted me, but it's better than a roach. 

So in summation...
Bland, overpriced food, free tea refills, friendly waitress, and unwanted crawling insects, but a clean bathroom... Three out of five stars."}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere, very relaxed, buffet style dining. Pricing is very economical, seems to be a senior hangout, can't wait to bring my father here!"}
{"text":"I always feel like I'm back in school b/c it looks and feels like a cafeteria when you first walk in.  You actually get a tray and stand in line while picking out food that servers place on plates for you.  They have a wide selection of southern comfort food though.  The usual fried chicken, fried pork chops, fried fish (catching the trend), collared greens, cabbage, macaroni and cheese, etc.  They do have about three or four selection of salad to choose from (Cesar, Spinach, Garden).  I always end of looking over everything, holding up the line, and then end of getting what I usually get...Baked Spaghetti w/ yams or Sweet Potato Souffle. Theirs a lot more sides to choose from (can't mention them all) and they usually change up every other day.  At the end of the line is a choice of desserts and beverages.  Between the two of us we end up spending about $13 - $16 together for everything (I guess it just depends on how hungry you are b/c everything is individually prices)"}
{"text":"Food here is always good. I come here with my wife periodically. We also sometimes order food for Thanksgiving."}
