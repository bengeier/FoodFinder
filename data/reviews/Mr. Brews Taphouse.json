{"text":"Another solid Mr. Brews location.  We just got takeout from here but it was delicious.  I recommend the Kentucky Bourbon Burger and the Pub Grub.  Both are rich and delicious with plenty of cheese and bacon. Props to them for making our order at 9:30pm on a Monday too!  While the kitchen is supposed to stay open until an hour before close (that's 11pm Su-Th), I have called with these late night purchases before and been told the kitchen had already packed up.  Good food good service!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. Very clean. I really enjoyed the Brew-chetta burger. I'd definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Cool experience! Some of the bartenders are more knowledgeable & friendlier than others, but there is a wide variety of beers to try! Not much variety to the food, but the standard burgers and fried foods!"}
{"text":"Food was good atmosphere was good! The prices were fair and there's a great selection of beers. Really liked the cheesy bacon ranch fries.

My only sort-of complaint is that there wasn't much to choose from on the menu. 

Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"If you like your burger done less than medium well you're going to be disappointed here. They claim that legally, that's the least well they can do a burger. Canceled our food order. Won't be back. Lots of beers on tap but they were out of Spotted Cow."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent!  Choice of 59 brews on tap, 3 Sheeps Cashmere Hammer so smooth, perfect rye flavor, perfectly poured. Southern Tier Double Stout was velvety smooth. We ordered the Brushetta Burger, Pulled Pork sandwich with a side of fresh cut fries. Fries come with a choice of seasonings, and had that great made from real potatoes taste. Pulled pork was nice and chunky with charred bits that were oh-so-good!  Burger with cheese and bruschetta was light and fresh. Prices very reasonable, service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"This is a great hangout. The beer is always cold & refreshing. The staff that have waited on us have always been very helpful in finding a beer to fit my tastes. It is clean and well lit. The menu is limited to burgers, but they have over 15 different ones. The black bean party is worth the up charge, it's delicious! They have one salad that is also good. It is appropriate for children over 5 or 6, but the restaurant is not set up well for children younger than that. It is a favorite for me and my family."}
{"text":"Delores is the best,  great beer on tap, food and atmosphere! Get to know the staff and you will have a great time day or night."}
{"text":"Great Beer selections. The burgers and fries are great too with reasonable prices. There are many TVs located throughout the place as well so there is always one with a good view. I have not watched any sporting events there yet but I imagine it would be a good place to go."}
{"text":"Great food, perfect temperature beer!, what to eat and what to drink, its all good so far! Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went to Brews Brothers for a birthday lunch with my wife and 3yr old son.  First impressions were \"wow, what a beer list!\" and \"wow, not much to choose from on the menu, good thing I'm in the mood for a burger!\".  I'd find out the second impression works to their advantage.

We started with the Pub Grub, which was homemade chips (warm) with a beer cheese sauce and bacon on them.  They didn't look like much but they were very good.

I typically order medium-rare meat, but they only do medium-well burgers.  To me medium-well is almost a guarantee of a dry burger, but not in this case. I'd say they were done perfectly.

I had the Bacon Mac n Cheese burger and my wife had the slaw burger.  The mac n cheese on mine would have been delicious on its own, but it was the burger that stole the show.  Very tasty, with the right amount of seasoning combined with great beef from Knoche's (same used by another establishment known for its burgers).

The pricing was reasonable on the food but be careful on the beer, my limited run Avery Pump[KY]n Bourbon Barrel Aged Imperial Pumpkin Porter was $10 for a small snifter (and worth it).  A few kinks to work out yet as the Pub Grub didn't ring up at the sale price and wasn't caught by the staff.  

Brews Bros keep it simple but execute what they offer well.  Overall it was a pleasant lunch experience; family friendly and tasty so we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First visit this week to the new place in town, for the Badgers' Sweet Sixteen game.  Selection of tap brews is quite impressive.  TVs to see the game any direction you look. Lots of windows and very pleasant decor, very clean place. Service was very good, and the burger was excellent."}
{"text":"Great burgers and homemade chips. Large selections of beer on tap."}
{"text":"We actually had kind of mediocre expectations coming into this meal, because of it's location in a strip-mall type area- but we were totally surprised.

Inside is they typical sports-bar vibe-- but with the friendliest staff and cooks in the open air kitchen. 
We started with the Parm Garlic fries (so good) with beer and then I got the cranberry salad and he got the Kentucky Bourbon burger. He said the burger was delicious- and the cranberry salad was delicious- and GIGANTIC! Only callout is the cranberry dressing seriously looks like Pepto Bismol- super unappetizing color...so if you're reading this Mr Brews chef- please figure out a way for it not to look so medicinal ;-)"}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way back to Iowa and had the best experience! Great, friendly staff, fantastic burgers, and fun wide selection of beers! Definitely recommend and would go back anytime!"}
{"text":"For a tap house the food is quite good. Solid hamburger, excellent fries (went with the shoestring option), and of course a great beer selection. The only reason this is not a 5 star review is the service. Competent enough but slow. The food came out crazy fast, but we sat with empty beer glasses far too often. Should not dissuade you from going though, still a great night out."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers. Don't get the wings $8 for 6 of the smallest chicken wings you have ever seen. Paying over a $1 a wing I would expect a lot more. Looked like something a cooking class in grade school would make. Ranch sauce was watery. Fries were soggy. Burgers were okay with soggy buns. Would go back for the beers but the food is below par. Great atmosphere with plenty of TVs for watching the games. Friendly and pleasant staff who know their beers!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and beer
Definitely worth the stop!
Found this on yelp, I'm from out of town and it's delish 
Got the regular cheeseburger and blue moon"}
{"text":"I just came for a few beers on a Sunday night so peak hours would probably feel different.  I was impressed by the upbeat attitude of the staff, how clean the place was, and how many really good IPA's they had. I do plan to return for what looks like good food and sports on the many flat screens."}
{"text":"Amazing cheese curds. Great burgers and a wonderful choice of beers!  Very clean and kid friendly. I will be back.  Added bonus is they have a gentleman on staff that knows everything and anything about beer."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go back for the food. Small burger, a la carte, only served well done that was well overpriced compared to other bars. Fries were, eh. Plenty of places with much better food. 

That being said, the beer selection was one of the best around. If you plan to just post up and drink good beer, not a bad choice."}
{"text":"We were in town for a soccer tournament and found this once on Yelp.  Not a ton of reviews but with a 4 out of 5 thought we'd give it a try.  TOTALLY LOVED IT!!  My wife had a salad, good size fresh veggies and great dressing (her words).  My Burger and Cajun fresh cut fries were awesome, a ton of flavor in both!  I'm hoping they bottle that mayo, soo good!  Had 4 kids with us, had a good kids menu with a great tasting grilled cheese (had to test it), and kids loved the gummies instead of fries!  Service was great and knowledgeable about the menu....gave it a 5, menu was good, location was good, kid friendly, great selection of beer, and great service!"}
{"text":"As the previous posters have said, the beer list is impressive. It's a good mix of all styles and has something for everyone. It's a pretty small restaurant and had about as many employees as customers. Our server let our drinks go empty for the majority of the meal which is sad, I would have loved to try another one of the beers. Not the worst service but no where near the best."}
{"text":"Great food, great ambiance and love the look of this place!  Mr Brews has upgraded their interior and it looks amazing."}
{"text":"Pros: 
the burgers were really unique and delicious
the staff was friendly 
the inside was decorated nicely 
the beer selection was nice

Cons: 
the menu was limited and lacked variety...if you want fries with your burger you have to pay $2.99 extra 
the set up of the dining room made it very crowded and hard to get to the restrooms
the service was terrible...asked for samples of beers and did not get them until we were done eating...rarely had full glasses of our drinks"}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection and great burgers.  The service is hit or miss.  Live the flight of beer, great way to try a variety for only  $10."}
{"text":"During a recent trip to the Verona/Madison area, I had the chance to visit this place multiple times.  The burgers were excellent as were the cheese curds, homemade chips and fries.  There are multiple burger/sandwich options on the menu.  The Kentucky Bourbon burger was my favorite and went nicely with the many brew options on the beer menu.  Staff members were very nice and service was fast."}
{"text":"Met some friends and family here on  a busy Friday night.
Wonderful staff, Rachel was the best; awesome selection of beers, gluten free, Wi and imports; great descriptions of each type.
Food was good, interesting flavors that worked.
The only downside was the presentation of the dinners.
Burgers tasted awesome but looked cold and lonely in the plastic basket all alone.
On the whole a solid 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and good food. The beer choices are amazing. Clean bathrooms. Very good waiter! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the Madison location and the Verona location has yet to disappoint. I've seen some of the reviews and am disappointed that they had a negative experience. I have been to the location numerous times and in spite of a new staff and being very busy, I had not had any negative experiences. The beer is always cold and the burgers are the best in town. They are always fresh and juicy.  The changing tap selections at both locations always has something new and intriguing to try!"}
{"text":"Another fantastic Mr Brews Taphouse location! The largest beer selection yet with 60 taps and of course the always perfect burgers. Great spot for taking in the game, bringing the family, or just hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday night and the place was pretty dead.  Great selection of brews to pick from but a very limited menu.  Wife got the chicken sandwich which was pretty pedestrian.  Good but nothing special.  I got the Ragin' Cajun burger which was good but not the spice level I associate with great Cajun food.

All in all OK, but the area has better burger places."}
{"text":"Great beer selection!  While the menu isn't extensive (burgers, chicken sandwich, pulled pork, salads) the food was great. My uncle is a local and pointed out the sign for Knoche's butcher shop; he says they have the best beef in the city. I can't argue with this, my Kentucky Bourbon Classic burger was excellent.  I like this place and will come back."}
{"text":"We came here because we had an online coupon for free fries off from DollarSense magazine. 

This. Is. The. Only. Reason. We. Decided. To. Come. Here. (this is important for later on)

Our waitress was super sweet, letting us sample 6 or so beers. So I know this isn't HopCat, but it just seems like they have a pretty weak tap menu. Realize thought, they also have Miller Lite and Bud Light on tap, so really the tap list, in my reference is smaller than what's stated on the board. The selection is anemic, it's like they just have the one namesake from a well know micro-brewery to be able to call it a micro list. When it's in your name and I can't find a beer that I like after 6 samples, that's saying something. 

We settled for the a couple of IPAs.

We ordered the Peanut butter and Jalapeno Popper burger with a side of fries. The peanut butter burger was one where it made your head tilt to the thought of it, but the sweetness of the ketchup with the saltiness of the peanut butter actually worked. We were underwhelmed with the Jalapeno Popper burger. The name makes you think of a stuffed fried jalapeno, like the Jalapeno Popper appetizers, but it was just a flavorless cream cheese spread with minced jalapenos. The menu said sauteed jalapenos, but these were still crisp and deep green, hardly sauteed.

So comes the bill. I showed our waitress our coupon, and she admittedly said it was her first day there and she didn't know how to apply the coupon so she got the manager. 

The manager, Vance, comes and looks at my phone, tells me that I can't use the coupon because it's not printed, hard copy. I check the coupon again and the only fine print was that only one coupon could be used per table, per evening. He then proceeds to tell us that, even if the coupon doesn't explicitly say it has to be printed out, it must be printed because otherwise \"you guys would be able to reuse it over and over again and we wouldn't have any way of knowing how many times it was used\". Fair, so we responded that it sounds like it's the company's advertising issue and not an user error. He then continued to make us feel like some kind of coupon-czars, conniving a scheme to bankrupt the chain. 

We stated the whole reason we stepped foot into the place was because of the coupon, so the coupon that's costing you $3.69 generated a  PROFIT of $28 (the tab excluding the fries) is suppose to make us feel like the a##holes? *smh*

Next time I need fine print mansplained to me, I'll check back in here. Otherwise, we likely won't return."}
{"text":"Fantastic food & great beer join together nicely!! Fresh cut fries with multiple different seasoning options are fantastic! Parmesan garlic and ranch are my favorite. Matt is a great General Manager too. Worth stopping in"}
{"text":"Fantastic Beer & amazing food!! Really can't go wrong here. The staff is friendly & knowledgeable! The peanut butter Burger is amazing with a fried egg! Add some fresh cut fries with cheddar seasonings for a complete meal. Jaye & Ozzy are the owner's of this location and are fabulous.... Stop on in and see for yourself"}
{"text":"I am conflicted with how to construct my review. My husband and I love going out for burgers, and this is one of two sit down restaurants for burgers in town.
So even when we have a bad experience, we always go back.

1. They have poor staffing! They have 2-3 reliable employees and often have people not show up for shifts-causing chaos.
2. They bring food out as it's ready, so someone in your party would have food for 5-10 minutes before everyone else.
3. They have some of the best fries in the business. Fresh cut and seasoned however you want them! I love plain salt, but my husband loves the Cajun seasoning!
4. Burger choices are amazing, I really enjoy the bacon Mac and cheese burger, while my husband loves to switch between the popper burger and the peanut butter burger. The one con to the bacon Mac burger is the bacon always seems like they didn't feel like cooking it that day. I have asked if they could cook the bacon longer before putting it on my burger and they said no because it's mixed with the mac and cheese. I have since switched to the plain cheeseburger. Which is amazing. They really do have great burger patties, where you can tell they are fresh.
5. They have a rewards program that earns you points. They add up fast and you can get a free burger or free burger and fries out of it!
6. Their cheese curds are some of the best we've had! Definitely a must order!"}
{"text":"I'm not very picky but I'm definitely a foody. This is one of the few sit down restaurants in Waunakee. The beer and burger selections are wonderful. However if you're looking for something that's not beer or burgers you are gonna want to go elsewhere. Went there for Friday fish and it was burnt and mushy on the inside. There was also only one waitress there (service has been poor every time I've gone. Lack of employees, no check ups, waiting for 15 minutes just to get drinks). Won't be going back, I've already given too many chances."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Fabulous beer selection. Great burgers. I had a bacon Mac n cheese burger and it was fabulous.  Husband had Kentucky Bourbon classic burger and it was great toooooo.  Excellent night."}
{"text":"It's average burgers and fries with an above average beer list. I'd come back just for that. Nice wait staff, clean, relatively fast, goo place to catch a game. We will be back."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful visit at mr. Brews in Waunakee this afternoon met the owner Tom and we had some exciting samples of beer along with a some delicious pints of cold local brews along with fabulous pub fare!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection on tap. I'm an avid ipa drinker and they had some of my old favorites as well as some I'd never heard of. Pub grub chips were pretty good but I wasn't overly impressed with the burger. Maybe since they mostly do burgers my expectations were too high but I thought it was just okay. Decor was very nice."}
{"text":"If all you're going to do is burgers (no Friday fish fry which I believe is a violation of state statute) then they better be awesome. They weren't. Not bad, just not great."}
{"text":"Checked in at Mr's Brew's tap house off monona Dr. Nice selection of tap's at happy hour price's. The pub grub loaded fries were huge and the burgers were pretty good to! Met Matt the Wauna King who was also checked in.Funny he's not as evel as his profile picture looks!!"}
{"text":"Lunch at the Monona location was quick, the waitress was a sweetie and the food was delicious. Burgers need more seasoning but the bun and fixings were amazingly good. Just under $8 for the burger alone but there's a WPS discount! Oh and the cheese curds and ranch were both amazing. Highly recommended this location."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a beer on our travels to check them out, it's in a strip mall with plenty of parking. The place looks fresh and clean with nice hi tables and a bar with about 40 taps to choose from. The decor looks like generic franchise thrown together with beer signs and flat screens. There is an open kitchen that is stainless and clean looking with fresh cut frys to order I noticed.

The first impression was not very good because the hipsters bar tender chucks our coasters at us from the end of the bar like he's playing the Bozo bucket game LOL. As time went on he was bouncing off the walls and couldn't be still, what's he on. He has like this 10 year old girl come behind the bar to wash glasses and glove up to make a wings order in the kitchen from start to finish which was completely weird.

There was a nice selection of beers from all over which I have never heard of so I just picked one which was ok. With the figity bar guy and the manufactured commercial/franchise feel we decided to move on. On to somewhere with more of neighborhood feel."}
{"text":"Since moving to Monona a couple of years ago I have been hoping for more restaurants to move into the area so I was moderately excited about seeing a chain that I was familiar with open not far from home. And my experience there was about what I expected. Good burgers that will never be my favorite but still solid. An okay happy hour but not amazing. Solid, friendly staff and a good but not extraordinary, beer list. I wavered between 3 and 4 stars but the warm cookies they bring you after your meal tipped to me the 4 side of the fence."}
{"text":"Mr. Brews is our hometown pub that we love to go to. However we've noticed that some things seem to be slipping in terms of quality. 

The good:
1. Burgers. Their burgers are delicious, my personal favorite is the peanut butter burger but every one we have tried we have loved!
2. Beer selection. They have just about every type of beer you could want. This is definitely a destination for craft beer lovers.

The not so good:
1. Service. We've experienced really varied service here and it seems to be getting worse. The wait staff never seems to be very happy that we're there and can come off as rude. We've also been blatantly forgotten about (took over 20 minutes to order beer).
2. Consistency. The last few times we've been here the chips were either burnt or way too underdone. 
3. Menu. Update your menu! I love sitting outside but the beer menu never matches what's on the wall. It's frustrating to try ordering a beer and find out that the restaurant doesn't actually have that beer anymore."}
{"text":"Mr. Brews is good enough. That's all they wrote.

This isn't going to be a lengthy review, as I don't have much to write about MBT. I much prefer the downtown location anyway - a larger palate of people.

I'll begin with the food because that's the highest compliment I can pay. Burgers are tasty - I have never been asked what level of done-ness I prefer - I believe they are all cooked to medium well or better by default. Turkey burgers run $3 more and veggie even more than that - I am none too pleased about this, so I usually just don't want to eat here. Fries and other pub grub is good, standard, not going to rave with CAPS or \"!!!!!\" anytime soon.

The atmosphere is COLD concerning overall temperature. In the summer/early fall, A/C seemed to be on blast both times I visited, and in the winter, constantly opening doors allowed Wisconsin frigid air in. Not fun, really...at all.

Beer selection is good - I'm not a major beer drinker, so it doesn't tickle my taste buds, but it's fine.

Staff tends to be more vanilla too - \"What'd'ya have\" with not a ton of unique personality, but polite? Yes, of course! Again, downtown MBT has a bit more to offer in these areas as well."}
{"text":"They have a lot of beers and you could spend all day here watching some games. The waitstaff was friendly. I didn't try the food so I can't speak on it. I'll go back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Real nice people. Offered three samples of IPA with no problems. Didn't try the food yet. Selection of beer is unreal. Again the tenders are awesome. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"3rd try timed ...I swear it keeps getting worse.  Beer selection is okay...but most staff is clueless about it.    It was busy but not packed....took much too long to get a server.  So long in fact a manager came over  to at least tell us the special and that  there was a brewery rep there.   Food came out fast enough..but fries were all about 4cm long....just bits...bottom of the fryer brown.  Asked for a side of mayo....server repeated it back.  10 minutes later no mayo..and when asked about it...she said she hadn't heard me!! Asked for everything on the burger...it came out plain.  Didn't bother to say anything about that....not sure she would have understood.   We won't give up on other Mr Brews in the area....but won't be back to this one."}
{"text":"Great beer selection! And the French fries are awesome!!! Had the Jalapeño Burger w BACON!!!! AWSOME!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Every time that I have been there, I have left disappointed. The beer selection is okay. The food is okay. One day, I wasn't able to order a beer for over five minutes. The manager was talking to one of his buddies, a beer rep (I think), drinking beer at the bar. Isn't that special! When someone finally got around to taking my order, I ordered a Plumptuous Scotch Ale, and I received some type of root beer. When questioned about it, they acted as if I've never tasted a Scotch ale before--pffft! I've brewed several myself. I promptly paid, left, and went to the local liquor store to buy a six pack of Plumptuous, to give them the benefit of the doubt, and my suspicions were confirmed. I had not received what I had ordered, but root beer, instead! They must've mixed up their lines. Their condescending nature was unforgivable. I will never return to any Mr. Brews ever again!"}
{"text":"Amazing selection of beers, considering this restaurant's small size.  Menu is exactly as advertised: beer and burgers.  It took longer than expected to get service, but the food did not disappoint.  2 negatives: concrete floor made conversations difficult, lots of echoing. Also the fluorescent lights are pretty bright and bordering irritating."}
{"text":"We heard they were under new management and gave the restaurant another chance.  The service was excellent!  The food was fantastic!  The owner came over to meet us and to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. We've been back several times and plan to make this our burger place."}
{"text":"Seriously best burger and gluten free bun ever! My burger is gone but wish I could have another despite how full I am. The brews-chetta burger was absolutely amazing"}
{"text":"Offers a limited food menu.  I've gotten a good burger each time I've been there, and the beer selection is top notch as you'd expect.  I'd love it if they had more outdoor seating but they are limited in space."}
{"text":"Peanut butter burger is most interesting, try it!"}
{"text":"Place was pretty much empty at 4'00.  Unenthusiastic service.  Happy hour....oh wait, not on the two 20 oz pours I had!?  Only 16 oz.  What the hell sense does that make?  Beer good, chain bar regulations, go local, hit waypoint across the street."}
{"text":"Dinner for 6 in the early evening counting 2 kids. While the kid's menu wasn't expansive, the chicken tenders they ordered were delicious. 

The burgers were flavorful. The french fries have tasty options for seasoning. The cranberry walnut salad was delicious.  

We didn't try any of the beers but there is a good selection on tap!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The staff is very friendly and interactive. They also have different board games at every table and some weekends have Mario Cart available for you to play while having a cold one and chatting with friends."}
{"text":"Mr Brews has been a great addition to the Monona area!  I have been in several times since they opened - just for drinks, just for food, and both!  As far as the beer goes, they have an amazing selection and every time we would go, they have at least one new beer.  The servers seem to be very savvy with the menu and always have a recommendation or two - and I love their 'beer board'!  The beer signs are created by staff and very visually appealing.  My husband's favorite thing to do is grab a flight because there's always too many good options to choose from.  We even frequented Mr Brews while I was pregnant - their Mr Brews Peanut Buster is crave-worthy, and Mr Brews always keeps a root beer on tap (it changes....Potosi and Point Root Beer while I was pregnant, it's 19/19 now).  I enjoyed pretending like I was 'drinking beer' with my husband while trying all their munchies!  The Pub Grub is so, soooooo good....but rich enough I can only do it once in a while.  Their chips are made in house and are great, and for both the chips and the fries - you can get them plain, or they have several different flavors you can get them in....so you can keep things interesting.  We just enjoyed Monday's Badger Bowl game at Mr. Brews....it was full but we were able to get a seat right before the game, and the service was great per usual - check them out!"}
{"text":"Not bad, just not outstanding.
I got a burger that doesn't really stand out in my memory.  My wife got a chicken sandwich that was just that, a piece of chicken on a bun.  Really boring.
The chips she got were pretty good.  I got the fries and wished I hadn't gotten them seasoned.  They had that nasty powdery stuff that some movie theaters used to have available for their popcorn.  Pretty much all salt and bland flavor.  I got a really good chocolate stout.  I was impressed with the beer selection.  
Oh, and back to my burger... The meat tasted really good, I'm a sucker for fresh ground beef burgers.  But it was rather small.  Having been on a diet it was going to be a special treat but my plan was to only eat half. I ended up eating the whole thing and not feeling very full. Also, I prefer mine medium rare. They only do them medium.
One other note, they messed up my wife's chicken sandwich and made her wait while I ate my burger while it was warm.  Didn't even try to compensate for her inconvenience."}
{"text":"First time here. Visited with friends and have to give an applause to our waitress. She knew everything about the beers we could have ever asked. She knew where they were made, how they tasted, and the flavors they had. That made it much easier to choose from the plentiful selection of beers.
Our burgers were cooked just the way we asked. Overall it was a very positive experience. I am sure if we're back in town together we will visit again."}
{"text":"LOVED THIS PLACE.

With the huge selection of beer, all on tap, go figure ;) and fabulous tasting hamburgers you can't go wrong here. The place is clean and bright with great decor. The menu is fairly a la carte, which gives you flexibility in what you want and the quantity.

We had the California burger and the Rajun Cajun. Both burger patties were cooked to perfection and all of the toppings were great. 

They also have a free loyalty rewards program. For every dollar you spend you get 1 point. When you get 50 points you get a free beer glass. When you get 100 points you get a free beer in your free glass.

Despite some of the other reviews I never met a Scotty, and this place had great service on off our lunch times on the weekend."}
{"text":"Kids eat free on Sundays with an adult entree. 
The kitchen is a little slow with the service. I got the peanut butter burger with no bacon and on a black bean patty. If you don't mention you want lettuce tomato onion - it does t come with any. It says so on the menu but I did not read it in detail so I had to ask my server to get some on the side. They burger doesn't come with any sides. You can pay extra and order some. 
The kids Mac and cheese comes with a good adult sized portion of chips or fries. We got the chips and they were pretty good. My kiddo loved it."}
{"text":"Mr. Brews, for me, is consistent with providing mediocre food and hit-or-miss service. I've now visited Mr. Brews on four occasions since it opened in spring 2015, and I've consistently had a less-than-stellar experience every time.

Something or someone is quite unorganized with the beer selection at Mr. Brews. I recently had dinner there with a party of four. Two people in our party ended up going through multiple different beer requests due to Mr. Brews being out of so many beers. 

After looking at the menu, Person A asked for Beer 1. Unavailable. How about Beer 2? Out of that too. How about Beer 3? Yes, Mr. Brews had Beer 3. Person B asked for Beer 4. No, they were out of that. How about Beer 5? Yes, they have Beer 5. Our server returned the table to tell Person A that they actually were also out of Beer 3. So he had to order Beer 6.

These beers are listed on their menu. This is either sloppy handling or inventory or sloppy marketing. Or maybe both?

Also, the food is pretty average. The fries are usually soft and soggy. (The Mr. Brews in Middleton has fabulous fries!) The burgers really aren't anything to write home about."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Mr. Brews which is not far from our house for the last year.  We've started describing it to our friends as our Cheers type of place.  

Even though it's a franchise the staff their takes the time to get to know people and makes them feel welcomed.   The burgers and fries are great and getting to sample is a bonus when your not sure about a certain type of beer.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Mr. Brews is okay. Burgers are kinda imaginative I guess but they really just taste okay. Fries/chips are not great but good tap list and sometimes they have free cookies. A consistent mediocre experience."}
{"text":"I like craft beer hence I like Mr. Brews! They have a great selection of taps that rotate regularly. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable if you have questions about a beer selection. If they don't know the answer, they are always willing to give you a sample! The burgers and sides are also amazing which you can pair nicely with their vast selection of beers! Get to Mr. Brews and grab a burger, a beer and catch a game on one of their many TVs!"}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from the outside but don't judge a book by it's cover!  It's a nice, small-ish sports bar with TV's galore inside.  Great place to catch a game without a crazy crowd.

I went with a burger and was able to swap the beef patty for turkey...heck you can even swap for bean or chicken breast and they are all no extra charge!  Heck yea!  Oh and they have sweet potato fries...that you can get in a FAMILY size order.  Double double heck yea!  The beer list is insanity also...so yeah, places like this make me happy."}
{"text":"Came here in a Monday night, it is right across from my motel. Good service, great beer selection, but the Monday Night Trivia could be better, couldn't understand the DJ cause he had the microphone pretty much in his throat."}
{"text":"Ok...been here several times.  Mostly week nights so convenient time.  Waunakee location has obvious advantages due to lack of options here.  Staff seems on sometimes; sometimes not.  Get a burger and beer you're good.  Veer off the menu at your own risk.  

Ordered the wings...\"basket full of meaty wings\". $7.99.  To my surprise, when 6 little wings come out.  Pic doesn't do justice but over a $1 per wing and smaller than my pinky.  Really?  Staff was good about understanding and apparently will bring up to owners.  Did receive 50% off but trust me they still made money on this order.  I am one who rarely complains and travels all over the US.  This was complete disregard for consumer value and I'm calling the owners out on it.  

3 stars and 10+ visits to the Waunakee location."}
{"text":"Seriously yummy burgers! Great beer selection on tap. Friendly!"}
{"text":"Under staffed, lacked attention or care, plus the manager just told me we are busy deal wth it.  

High five customer service."}
{"text":"Echo Lauren H review especially on servers/service.Ours didn't know if they had any 16 oz aluminum cans? It is a real task to decide on and order beer."}
{"text":"Don't let the front door fool you.  We almost drove away when we arrived, I'm glad we decided to check it out. This is not a fancy place but they nail it. Amazing selection of beer. Fun menu that allows you to order a burger and if you feel like it a basket of fries for the table. 

Some very smart touches. The bar has power plug ins underneath. If you need to charge your device, it's very easy. Lots of big tv's to watch sports. Great staff. Perfect spot to order a burger and a beer. 

I would certainly stop in again."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here on our way to Sturgis and we were not disappointed! When you walk in the first thing you see is the long line of beer taps behind the bar. We sat at the bar and our server came right up to us and was very knowledgeable on all the beers on hand. She let us sample some and recommended a great beer. Then we ordered our burgers. WOW!!! Juicy, flavorful, and hot off the grill! They have unique and delicious flavors on the menu. OH and the cheese curds!! Perfection with their chili lime aioli! Perfect place to stop and refuel ourselves!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for a wide variety of beers. The burgers are good but the fries and chips  are even better. Always friendly  and very knowledgeable"}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE Mr. Brews!!! Amazing burgers, exceptional service (Peaches rocks!!) Plenty of brews, constantly updated. We've NEVER had a bad experience at this location; I wish I could say the same for the downtown venue."}
{"text":"Burgers: Customers should be able to choose how they want their burger done and not dictated to them how their burger will be done.  Medium well is a little too \"hockey puck\" for my liking.  That being said, customers can be accommodated, which is MOST appreciated.  No pun intended, but well done Waunakee staff!
Beers: Great selection!  Keep those local brews in stock. Lake Louie is desired.
Service: Awesome!
Come Again?  Most definately!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Fries were soggy and lukewarm. Cheese curds were good. Biggest issue here is you're left hanging if all the tables are full. No place to wait and no servers care."}
{"text":"Had the Brews-chetta burger and it was really good.  Service was fast and friendly and I was able to try a beer sample before ordering a full draw.  Beer selection was awesome. Only problem was it is too bright in there, could eliminate the shop type lights and it would be a really cool place to hang out."}
{"text":"We met our son here for dinner. Great beer selection. Our group had a couple burgers, chicken sandwich and tropical salad with chicken.  Food was great. Nice outdoor setting area."}
{"text":"If only....
Tap selection is unparalleled in the area, but the food....fresh ground from Knoche's, fries and chips made fresh from potatoes in front of your eyes...with such quality beginnings, you'd think the food would be excellent as well.  It's not.  They insist on turning that beautiful fresh ground into medium-well blandness...such a waste of a quality ingredient.  French fry toppings are underwhelming.  
If this place had a carry-in policy like the nearby Hop Haus, it would be my favorite spot in Verona.
Great for beer...disappointing for food."}
{"text":"From a beer choice perspective, Mr. Brews is a solid go-to.  The bartenders are generally knowledgeable and the beers selected often rotates so there is something always new to try.  From an aesthetics perspective, you won't forget that Mr. Brews is located within a strip mall.  The interior is stark with only beer signs and memorabilia breaking up the monotony.  It simply doesn't make you want to spend a lot of time there.  Given the current number of places that serve great beer and wide choices, I would much rather to come to a place with character vs. a concrete bunker."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Tasty beer.  Inexperienced staff.  Bright lighting.  I was in a party of seven.  We got our food one by one.  Chaotic kitchen.  The staff was young with no manager on hand.  I asked a question about beer and was handed a beer menu instead."}
{"text":"Great burgers and great beer selection.  The burger with Mac n cheese in it is awesome.  Also, the fries are yummy and you get to add flavor to them.  I usually get the ranch flavor added.  The one on Monona is never busy.  Give this place a try....I was apprehensive due to it seeming like too much of a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in for  beer as I was saying next door at AmericIinn. Been her before, great  service, , average food. This time I was wowed. Awesome service, beer was sooo cold and the attention to detail amazing. Place was spotless. Manager was spot- on, interacting with guests and the burger with peanut butter was awesome. Rate 5/5. And they have cheese curds too. 6/5."}
{"text":"I don't go here to watch games or drink even though that's what there more or so for but I do go the burgers and chips. I love the food. All the flavors and the staff are friendly as hell. Would recommend for anyone to just try once."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is with this place. You can't order your burger any other way than medium well. This said our burgers were solidly well done. If you are paying $7-8 for a burger, the quality should be such that it's safe to order an medium rare burger and it should be available that way if you want it that way. 

My Mushroom and  Swiss was poorly seasoned, if at all. It was bland. I'm not even sure there was salt and pepper seasoning the burger or the mushrooms. I'd say the burgers are over priced for what they are, essentially assembly line burgers cooked on a mechanism similar to Burger King. Culver's would be both better quality and a better value. 

This said Culver's doesn't serve beer. This place literally has dozens of varieties of beer on tap. I ordered the Milk Shake Stout on a nitro tap. It was flat - a nitro tap beer should arrive with a distinctive vanishing, yet creamy head. 

The tap pours are small, medium and large. Small pour is 7 oz. - I guess with so many taps, offering a little size is helpful? The server was very nice and offered to let us sample beers be for we committed. 

Bottom line - it's a chain, nothing special... Not my thing. If you are looking for fast food style burgers with an expansive beer list, it might be your thing."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a drink. nice clean place with solid service. Did not eat but the menu looks good. Next time I'm in town I will try the turkey burger for sure."}
{"text":"Dirty Taps, Watertered Down Coors Lite, flat Pepsi....

Placed our order, burgers do not come with anything so we had to purchase fries, chips, etc separately. Kids meals came with a side and a drink. Everything, including salad dressing, is an add on.

We haven't even gotten our food yet and already disappointed. [intermission while we wait for our food....]

Just Go Somewhere Else.

Burgers were cheap, frozen patties; blue cheese burger had barely enough on it to cover the top; the kids meal chicken strips seemed okay however they messed up the order and only brought out 2 instead of 4.

The only good things were the sweet potato fries and chips which were cooked to perfection. 

Definitely not worth the $50.12 for 4 lunches.

Advice? Go to Arby's....."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today for a quick brew. The place had a decent crowd, but unfortunately only one person working the bar and tables. It was almost noon on a Saturday. 

The bartender was great and was doing his best to keep up with all the food orders and drink orders. They had a great selection of beer on tap, my only complaint is that 2 of our choices for beer which were on the menu were out. 

I settled for an Oktoberfest which was mighty tasty and served in a 10oz snifter glass ($3). 

If you are looking for a nice variety of beer, give it a try.  They have all the standards, with a nice mix of craft and micro brews. 

By the way, before we left, two more staff showed up to help. 

The food coming out of their little kitchen looked great, they were even making homemade fries!  I'll
Have to give the Fiona try next time. 

I'd give it a 4 for the selection, but the lack of staff and the empty kegs force me to go with a 3 on this visit."}
{"text":"Burgers are good. The March madness deal does not exist as every Miller lite we had was charged at full price. Kind of a shock to pay $50 for one meal and 9 beers for two people. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"More than 50 beers on the tap!!! 
What could be better? Brand new location in Verona. 
They also have location in Waunakee. We will stop by there tomorrow!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, Tv's every where so there's no bad seat in the house.
30+ beers beers on tap local craft and big box. The Cajon burger was really good."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a burger and a bunch of great brews! The staff is super friendly and the owner goes out of his way to help out with service and making sure guests are having a great time. They also bring in live music to coincide with tap takeovers and beer nights, which is always a fun time. The location is good and the outside patio bar is a cool place to hang out in warmer months."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. Their custom recipe original pulled pork is Sysco bbq sauce and the pulled pork was more like burnt ends than pulled pork.  Chunky, over cooked, and not good.  That's all I had and I was starving and just couldn't do it.  Great beer selection and gluten free options staff was nice but not super attentive"}
{"text":"Horrible burgers! Dry and flavorless. Not bad enough to send back because I doubt they could improve upon it. No place that cooks meat only to medium well should be allowed to call itself a burger joint."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place. 70+ beer menu with a lot of local options and variety, lots of burgers and delicious fries. Food menu is simple but yummy. Service was incredible. Our group of 10 all had different burgers and all were happy with their choice. They don't take reservations but I called ahead due to having a large party and everyone I spoke to was so nice and accommodating. Our server was Kolin who was absolutely fantastic. I'm a long time yelper, first time poster and the excellent service is what inspired me to share my experience."}
{"text":"Brews Brothers ... a play on the Blues Brothers ...  I came in with a party of 6 only to find high top tables for 2 or 4 ... no problem, we just pushed 2 together.

The 1st two tap beers I ordered they were out of ...  +40 beers ... I hope they are keeping their lines clean ...

Ordered a water to find the straw was about an inch short of the top of the glass.

Food ... Burgers, turkey burger, pulled pork ... those are your choices ... no other options all burgers cooked to well done.

They have a handful of sides including home made chips (which were a bit rubbery) and hand cut fries (which were like mash potato sticks; they needed to be cooked a lot longer).

The burger was decent as long as you are okay with well done.  If you need a fork you have to ask for one (oh and it is a plastic fork).

my recommendations:

1.  take out some tables.  it was jammed full of tables and chairs, making it supper hard to walk around the place.
2. If you are going to only offer well done burgers you might was well have a slow cooker full of done burgers to help speed up the process.
3. the fryers have to be to small for the volume of fries and chips they need to make (this is why they are mushy).
4. They need other menu items.  How about chicken or a salad?

Right now it is at about dive bar status ..."}
{"text":"We really appreciated the service (with a three year old, every second counts and the fruit snacks are a nice touch), but the food is always meh. Good beer selection!"}
{"text":"No macro brews on tap. Well, except Sam Adams. Rotating taps, lots of variety.

I'm here for the IPA's. Bartender very knowledgable. 

Burgers are made to order, if you insist on rare or med rare. Fresh beef."}
{"text":"Great burgers, the meat is sourced from a local butcher and the fries are sliced from fresh potatoes right next to the grill.  The burgers themselves are outstanding, as is the beer selection, which highlights local Wisconsin brews.  My only gripe is one bartender who emphatically insulted the beer I had ordered, referring to it as \"nasty\".  I doubt any beer that the proprietor has put on the tap list could deserve such label and I felt that my own judgement was equally insulted. Aside from that, the establishment is perfect for fantasy drafts, post-soccer games with the family or hanging out after softball/hockey."}
{"text":"Have to give a big shout out to the big pretzel & beer cheese sauce! Absolutely delicious cheese sauce, very creamy and has some herbs & slices to make it different. You only get 3 sticks so divide and conquer !"}
{"text":"Really good reasonably priced burgers and very awesome selection of beer to fit any style or taste."}
{"text":"Two things stand out about Mr. Brews.  Number 1, they use meat from the best butcher in town.  What does this mean?  The quality of the burger is always very good.  I actually like the fact that they have a limited menu because that means they can do what they do very well.

Second, they always have a great as Sorento of beer.  Tonight, for example, I am having a Left Handed Brewing stout (wake up dead) followed by a Lexington Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale.  Just a great selection


They have gone through some staff but Vance is a constant and a family favorite.  He is knowledgeable and personable and that is what they try to 8mputw in this location.

If you are looking for something that is not a burger, this is not your place.  If you want burgers, fries, and curds, you have come to the right place."}
{"text":"Good food, poor service. 
We will not be back after this last visit. There are plenty of restaurants in the same area that have friendlier and more attentive staff."}
{"text":"I've been by Mr. Brews often and it was just a matter of time before I went to eat there.  

Being pretty new, the place was immaculate.  Clean and tidy inside.  We grabbed a table and checked out the menu.  I was a little surprised at how limited the menu is.  Clearly, they are all about burgers.  I wanted a salad, but they had two choices - a really basic, plain salad and some walnut deal that I wasn't interested in.  They had a pulled pork sandwich that I was very curious of, but I went with my usual Mushroom and Swiss - the server said it was amazing, so I went for it.

The food came out quick (but not TOO quick that it had you wondering, you know?).  My burger was excellent - big mushroom slices and gooey Swiss cheese.  There was a \"gravy\" that went with it that tied it all together.  The server said it was one of the best in town, and I wasn't going to fight him.  My lunch partner had the pulled pork and she enjoyed it.  We split a basket of \"chips\" - they looked a little over-done (pretty brown and crunchy), but they were salty and tasty.  Our server was chatting with us near the end of the meal and mentioned the chips were really good with their beer cheese \"sauce\".  He brought out a sample for us to try - it was thick, like a dip, and UH-MAZING!  They make it from scratch there - very beery and popping with flavor.  I wish I would have known earlier so I could have had it with all my chips!  I bet that sauce is great on a burger, too!

The service was fantastic.  Granted, it wasn't very busy when we were there, but everyone we encountered was over-the-top friendly.  The manager came out to see how things were and we chatted for a bit about the franchise and how they were doing (being new to Waunakee).  Both the manager and server were genuinely interested in how we were doing and what we thought of everything.  You could tell they cared, and that's a big plus.

I didn't get to explore their beer options, but I could see they had a wall full of taps (I would have loved to try one of each, to be honest).  

I gave it four stars.  I'll eat there again without hesitation. Others should too!  This could be someone's 5-star favorite.  The only think keeping this from being 5 stars for me is a few more menu options and maybe some comfortable seating (a padded booth versus all wood seating).  But that's being nitpicky - go try this place!  Have a burger, enjoy some beers, and have a good time!"}
{"text":"California Burger was amazing!  I also, highly recommend the fresh cut fries with garlic parmesan seasoning with a side of dipping sauce.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and brother on a Saturday night after finding every other place we tried had well over an hour wait to eat. We loved the large selection of beers and the burgers we had were amazing! If you want fries though they are extra which we ordered to share and some cheese curds. The downside of when we were there was they had a bar crawl bus that stopped by (and of course it was their last stop) and it became extremely loud and because we were sitting at the bar to eat, all the people were trying to reach between us to order drinks even though there was plenty of open bar area for them to order at. Overall it was good food and the staff were friendly and attentive, we would come back again."}
{"text":"So bad. We've given this place 2 tries. First was junction rd. the service was horrible and the food was mediocre. We did not like that we couldn't order our burgers to the temp of our liking. 
Tried the one in Verona. Again, horrible service and food was dry and disgusting. Dairy Queen has better burgers and quicker service! We will never be back unless it's for a beer."}
{"text":"Five stars for awesome beer lovers happy hour and their fresh chips!  Burgers are great flat top style, always cooked juicy.  Atmosphere is for sports lovers but good for all!  A must stop"}
{"text":"First time to a Mr. Brews. Nothing special. My boyfriend and I both agree the burgers had no taste. The fries were super greasy."}
{"text":"Hard to beat the tap beer selection in this area - they win that contest, hands down.  Service is generally good.  That all said, I think that while the burger is certainly serviceable, it's not excellent...if anything burger is on par with Culver's (which, by the way, is probably 1/2 the price). 

Also, not a place for night owls - they close pretty early and don't like keeping the kitchen open late, either."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 5 star....and it all belongs to the best server of the week. Unfortunately, I forgot her name. Great smile, bantered well with the boys in our group and our glasses were never empty.

The hamburgers were good. I was looking forward to the bomb fresh cut fries. That didn't happen. That said, it was a fun place with decent food, cold beer, and good location."}
{"text":"I came here shortly after they opened on a weekday.  The restaurant was deserted other than us and the server, so service was immediate and friendly.  The menu is primarily beer and burgers which I expected as I have been to their original location in Weston, WI.  Others came in while we were there as I was surprised at how quickly our food was out.  We had delicious burgers served within 10 minutes along with fries fresh out of the fryer.  

Tip:  there are turkey burger and bean burger alternatives for an additional fee.  There is also a gluten-free bun option if you want the whole experience.  There's also a ton of beers on tap.  

Well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Pros: Excellent beer selection & parking.   If you just want beer this place is great.  

Cons: Burgers & food in general, highly disappointing.  Tried this place 3 times.  If you are going to celebrate yourself as a burger place,  your beef better be good and fresh enough to offer the burgers cooked however the customer wants it.  If well done or \"some pink\". Is all you can offer, don't put \"burgers\" on your logo.  Not going back.

(Also not very kid friendly.)"}
{"text":"I goto this location at least once a week. It's always top notch. Great selection of beers and great food. I always feel right at home there. They have special tappings, tap takeovers, live music, and trivia! The staff there are the best, and the owner really cares about his business. I highly recommend stopping by!"}
