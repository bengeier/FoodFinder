{"text":"Returned to an old favorite rating place this evening. Very good food & friendly service!"}
{"text":"I went there on a Saturday morning around 8:15 am.  I was pleasantly surprised with  the quality of food and great service.  The name of my waitress was Sam and she was super nice!  I ordered the corned beef hash and it was so much better than a very famous deli in New York and Connecticut.  The waffle was good also but I didn't taste it until I was done with my corned beef hash so I wasn't able to taste it when it was fresh off the griddle.  Still, the whipped butter and cream were fresh. The strawberries were fresh and plain with no sauce which I liked.   I am usually a very hard person to  please. But I will definitely go back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Had the Reuben sandwhich defiantly enough for two. Everything was good and the waitress was honest about what we should order, which was very helpful. I would come again."}
{"text":"Poor service...pouty waitress with attitude. ..charge more on weekends for same meal on weekdays. ..just rude even mgmt is ingenuous. ..used to gp yhete regularly but never going back agsin...can get same food at ihop or any Bob Evans's"}
{"text":"The service at Deli is abysmal! Everytime I go there to place a carry out order there's usually something wrong. If I ask for my eggs to be over medium they're always over easy, if I ask for a meal on the menu when I get it home there's a hair in it! Today when I attempted to place a carry out order after not going there for 2 months the manager refused to honor the price that was online, even though he stated that the prices online were accurate. Therefore I will never, ever go to Chicago deli again.  *Tried to order a Good Morning America and the person said it was $4.99 when online it clearly states for $4.59. She stated the online price was accurate but they wouldn't honor it"}
{"text":"I went to the Chicago Deli Solon for the first time today for lunch around 11:45 with some co-workers. I ordered a Hot Corned Beef sandwich. The service was fast and friendly. The sandwich was huge. However, the corned beef was extremely dry, almost no moisture. And it was not hot. It was barely lukewarm. And I wasn't asked if I wanted anything on the sandwich, not that any condiment would have helped it. I was extremely disappointed since I had heard good things about the place. Don't think I'll go back there. And I certainly wouldn't recommend the hot corned beef."}
{"text":"This is gone!  No sure if they are moving to a new address but the whole lot is torn down and construction crews are building a new building there for the Cleveland Clinic."}
{"text":"This place is an institution in Solon.  Very good, friendly service and a nice menu.  Quality can be spotty at times.  This morning's Hashlet and Hash browns tasted off - a bit sour - as if the kitchen was using bad oil or a dirty grill.  Dry old melon on the plate was a turn off.  Why would anyone serve that?   Nearly $6 for a bowl of overripe, just-beginning-to-spoil strawberries was not very impressive either.  However, this may be more the exception to the rule.  Often times this place delivers great food.  The down side is it is so busy it's difficult to get a table."}
{"text":"PATHETIC... The waitress slammed my coffee on the table, gave me no creamer or sweetener, I still said thank you as she rushed off. I tried to get her attention as she ran around like a chicken with her head cut off. She was obviously in the weeds, but that's no reason to slam down guests food and drink. She was obviously unhappy which made me unhappy and unwanted... So I left and will NEVER go back!!"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here for the second time. The atmosphere is open and welcoming, with all the standard options for diner seating. I had the eggs Benedict, which was delicious. The eggs were cooked perfectly, and the hollandaise was rich and flavorful. Only downside was I would need to order toast with this very filling meal to appreciate and handle the amount of hollandaise they put on the plate. Otherwise, a very satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Challah french toast!  We eat here probably 10 times a year and I can't bring myself to order anything else for breakfast.  Each slice is 2 inches thick and dipped in tapioca before it is cooked.  It makes for a crispy outside, but soft center that is to die for..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast this morning. Ordered the corned beef hash , two poached eggs soft and well toasted English muffin. 25 minutes later the food arrived. The place was half full and they appeared fully staffed. I say that because there were lots of waitresses standing around. Toast was cold and not buttered, eggs were not fully cooked. Corned Beef hash is \"pebble\" like in its consistency - never seen it served this way. And not much meat for that matter , but of course plenty of potatoes! Bad service and bad \"signature\" CBH. This is not my first visit but certainly my last"}
{"text":"The service is great and the food is too. If you're looking for a great breakfast this is the place. That said, you won't be disappointed with the food regardless of the time of day. Their cheesecake selection is amazing. I recommend their pumpkin pie cheesecake. Hits the spot for anyone with a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"The new location is bright and clean. Nice upgrade. Service is OK. George always nice. I've been here a few times and its been fare. A deli should be able to make a sandwich though. I ordered turkey off the bone, wheat, spicy mustard, lettuce & tomato. I couldn't get it with onions. Off the bone was an upgrade. Sandwich arrived with a wilted romaine with the spine in, pink/green tomato, no mustard and a simply bland slab of turkey. No flavor at all. No one should be allowed to charge for that and call themselves a deli. If they need ripe tomatoes and veggies they can raid the Giant Eagle next door. Go to D&R bagel, Saaj or even Subway."}
{"text":"Mmm the Challah French toast is to die for! Can't wait to go back and try some of their yummy-looking desserts!"}
{"text":"Can't beat this place for food quality, welcoming atmosphere and super service.  The corned beef hash is out of this world and should be rated \"Best in Cleveland\". Food arrives promptly and is always exactly as ordered.  A visit from the owner at tableside on each visit is so nice.   A jewel of Solon!"}
{"text":"I typically love this place for lunch. George is a friendly and attentive owner with a good staff. Unfortunately this Friday was a bad one for the Chicago Deli. We arrived early for lunch, 11:35, got a table right away but waited over 30 minutes for soup and half sandwiches. That wasn't the worst of it. The bread on the sandwiches were dry and crumbly. Then we tried dessert. Well two pieces of cake one carrot the other cassata. Both were dried hard to the touch on one side. Poor quality control and lack of attention by the waitress. We cut the ends off the cake and ate what was left but the complaints to waitress fell on deaf ears. We were offered neither a discount or a free piece of cake."}
{"text":"Had lunch there for the first time today, and I have to say - I will be back!! I had the California BLT - nice fresh avocado and just the right amount of bacon. Delish! Had the potato salad as my side. I'm not usually a huge potato salad fan, but this one was pretty good. Decent amount of seating and friendly, prompt service make this place a winner!"}
{"text":"Owner greeted us several times! Service and food was excellent! Visiting from Dallas,tx"}
{"text":"I went here with my grandma when I came to visit her.  Corky and Lenny's along with jacks was closed due to Passover, so we went here.  My grandma got the matzah ball soup while I had a corned beef sandwich.  The atmosphere was nice and you can tell there were a lot of regulars, my grandma included.  The owner came to our table and said hi to us and talked to my grandma for a while, which was very nice.  The place was packed!  I had a taste of her soup and it was really good. My sandwich was tasty, but a bit dry. I put quite a bit of mustard on it which I normally don't do.   Other than that the place was great!"}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast a couple times.  They make a pretty darn good breakfast sandwich, but the service isn't great and the place is pretty worn.  If you are looking for a decent greasy spoon in Solon or the surrounding area, this is a good place to stop."}
{"text":"Chicago Deli is a very nice and friendly place to eat! Every time we've gone in we have always been greeted by the owner! Their corn beef sandwich are super!"}
{"text":"Have had numerous bad meals here.  Iced tea is like water. Overpriced  I had a gift certificate the last time and ended handing the remsining gift certificate to another customer.  Lots of people like it here tho.  I'm back using up another gift certificate"}
{"text":"My go to food when I am not feeling well... Matzah ball soup from Chicago deli! I have gone through too many carton of that soup I couldn't even begin to count. The atmosphere has always been a charming part of this restaurant but the new location just makes it even better. Any time I get a corned beef craving this is my first stop, the only place if you want good corned beef in Solon!"}
{"text":"Lunch here exceeded expectations.  Highly recommend the half sandwich/soup deal.  The Mishmash soup was a perfect mix of chicken noodle and matzo ball soup.  The corned beef with toasted challah bread was delicious.  The only complaint was that the hummus appetizer was a bit bland although my mother in law did enjoy it.  Overall a nice spot for lunch."}
{"text":"I grew up in Solon (SHS 1969)  and enjoyed many meals with my parents at the Chicago Deli. Nowm family loves this restaurant too.  We live in Marysville, Ohio  and if we're anywhere near Cleveland we have to stop for matzah ball soup and  corned beef on rye.  Best corned beef there is-- and that includes the deli's in NYC, Chicago and Cleveland.  George and is family are tremendous.  One can't go wrong at the Chicago Deli in Soloin."}
{"text":"Food is typical but poorer quality to other local deli's. Hash browns excessively greasy, omelette more like scramble eggs fried and over cooked. Special soup of the day was salty and none of the flavors suggested in the name Lemon Basil and orzo was over cooked.   They do attempt to meet varied dietary needs with vegetarian food. Service is cold and impersonal beyond gentleman who greets.  This location obviously serves many elderly but handicap parking is not in front if you can't drop off."}
{"text":"Great service, wonderful food, and the nicest people working here! Too bad there is not a place like this in Columbus. I would eat here everyday if I could!!"}
{"text":"When In Solon I have been going to Chicago deli , it is  a very nice place ,  the beef brisket with potatoes, gravy ,and veggies is what I have been eating lately, it is delicious, also a very large portion . , I figure that it gets pretty full at times, I go there after work ,and I really enjoy there food ."}
{"text":"Pretty much an average Deli sit down restaurant. I went here for lunch and it was a huge portion for the price. I had a tuna melt sandwich. It was honestly pretty bland. But I must say their sweet potato fries were amazing though. The service is good. It's not too busy when I visited though. I'm giving it four stars because I just think the food wasn't amazing but it was good. I would go again."}
{"text":"It's really close to my workplace, so it gets attention from me.  Chicago Deli is very much a deli... fresh meats and lettuce and tomatos go a long way.  Service is moderately quick and prices are middle of the road.  One highlight is the Romanian.  Great Salami sandwich with a slightly different sauce.  First place I've had this particular combo.  I've eaten it once, and I'll eat it again!"}
{"text":"Found this place by sheer chance wandering around Solon; had a matzah ball soup and Reuben sandwich and they were great. Service was great too."}
{"text":"Recently opened in the Giant Eagle plaza in Solon.  The menu is extremely large and I can't wait to go back and try other foods.  Authentic Chicago style meals.  Food and service were very good.  Great value for the portions and it appears that they cater events or to-go trays as well...great addition to the area."}
{"text":"Nice little Chicago style deli located by the Cleveland Clinic.  The place gets busy at lunch, but their sandwiches are big! The staff is courteous, but rarely refill your drink. You pay up front when you're done."}
{"text":"Have gone to the ChicagoDeli for years and it has always been great until today.  I ordered a low carb broccoli, cheddar omelet with turkey sausage patties.  The omelet was way over cooked, the broccoli was only stalks, no florets, sausage was way over done and chewy. There was only a small amount of cheddar.  Will not go back again after going there over 30 years.  The busboy asked me if are food was good and I said not really and he walked away laughing.  My husband got a piece of ham that was chewy and dry, toast was burnt.  When you think of broccoli, the stalks are garbage, throw it away!!"}
{"text":"Took the family to visit relatives in a C-Town suburb.   We got off the plane, got our rental and started to ride eastward.   When we got to Solon, we decided that we wanted to grab a bite to eat prior to our family visit.   We used to live in this area but a lot of our old standby places were gone.  So off to Yelp for recommendations - that brought us here.     Overall, good quality, nice menu and good portions.   I'd probably consider this place more of a diner than a deli as their menu is pretty diverse.     My corned beef sandwich was pretty good.   The rest of the family enjoyed their meal as well.     Not a bad place if you are hungry and looking to fill up."}
{"text":"The friendly service and delicious food make this deli the eatery that puts Solon on the map.  I was there yesterday afternoon for lunch, it was 100+ degree's outside but nice and cool inside.  We were in a bit of a rush with an appointment 45 minutes from our time of entry.  We explained this right away and were seated by George the owner, who chatted with us about their forthcoming move inside of the shopping center that Giant Eagle just purchased, then he helped us get our drink orders in pronto!  The waitress took over from there and brought us the drinks.  Shortly thereafter we ordered.  Within 20 minutes of arrival at Chicago Deli our food was at our table.    I ordered a Turkey Club and it was by far the best Turkey Club I have ever had.  There was tons of meat in the sandwich and all of my complex requests for foods that should comprise this sandwich were met.  Like I said, best sandwich ever!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food they serve is amazing and the service is amazing. I had the gyro and it was just delightful."}
{"text":"So glad to hear Chicago Deli was able to come to an agreement with Giant Eagle Plaza owners and stay in Solon!!! One of the few non-chain restaurants left in the area. George the owner is  incredibly warm, and treats every customer as if he's known them for years.   I once had their catering at a wedding (all Lebanese food) and it was DELICIOUS. Unfortunately I don't think the middle-eastern fare they serve in-house is quite as good (limited menu), but when I lived in Solon I shopped specifically there for my home-made hummus and terrific olive oil that he ships in from a family member in Lebanon.   Breakfast is the best. Now that I live out of state, I have had to really search hard for Challah to try to duplicate their version of French Toast. The hot roast beef at lunch is terrific. Good burgers and soup are great too. And the cookies...mmmmmmm...  The Chicago connection? I have abso-flibbin'-lutely no idea where that comes from. I suggest someone ask George and report back! Next time I'm in town, I look forward to seeing their new digs!"}
{"text":"Hard to believe I wasn't in the big city! Food was amazing, I had a fantastic corned beef sandwich with zero fat and their very tasty matzo ball soup. The staff was very welcoming and the owner stops by and made you feel like you come there all the time. Prices for what we got was very reasonable and without hesitation we will be back."}
{"text":"I eat here only ones it was good. Good coffee good omelet good fast service. What else do you need on Saturday morning. we ordered corned beef to go a lot it's always lean and juicy"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery for a meeting - and the food was on time, the delivery was seamless and the platter was wonderful. Very fresh bread, good luncheon meat and salad, and I ordered the dessert tray (old world) and that was also excellent."}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch and breakfast. Breakfast feels like you're eating At home except you don't have to cook it yourself!   Lunch: sweet potato fries are the way to go as your side. Feels like they just cut and cooked them! I love the tuna melt, Fresh with light mayo which I love. Gyro & chicken Schwarma were authentic and generous amount of meat! Salads are a good size, but wish they had more greens than iceberg.   Definitely feels like a family run restaurant, so friendly and everyone checks in on you to make sure you're enjoying yourself and the food."}
{"text":"Meh.....if u like ur food undercooked or overcooked, this is the place for u. Server was nice though. this place does serve beer & wine..(maybe their kitchen staff dabs into it..)"}
{"text":"My family (wife, four year old daughter, and myself), visited for dinner on Saturday early evening.  Pleasantly, it wasn't all that crowded, and I am aware that breakfast and lunch are their busiest times on the weekends.    My wife ordered the gyro and really enjoyed it stating the way it was wrapped was great for ease of consumption and there was plenty of delicious gyro meat and the sauce was great.  My daughter had the kids burger.  Plenty of fries and pickles which she loves and she ate the burger entirely.  I ordered the Saturday prime rib special.  The portion was more than fair for the price and the au jus was delicious.  The prime rib itself could use a couple tweaks.  A little heavier seasoning on the outside would be good to create a flavorful crust.  In addition, the challenge of keeping medium rare throughout ended up with the outermost parts being medium well to well done.  That happens occasionally when cooking from cold, or depending on whether you roast at the highest temperature at the beginning or end.  The middle was medium rare and overall it was enjoyable.  One of the main reasons for this review is to commend our server (Madison I believe).  She was pleasant, efficient, and took the time to mix up chocolate milk for our daughter instead of just saying they don't have it.  I truly appreciate the attitude and effort overall.  It's not fine dining, and it's not intended to be.  It was an overall pleasant experience with food that satisfied and provided a good time out with family.  I would return to try other items from the diverse menu and enjoy the service.  Kudos!"}
{"text":"Amazing omelet, tabouli. and falafel. Owner very kind. Staff a little disorganized but friendly. Food so fresh and delicious! I'd i loved closure I'd come back often. Relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you love Corned Beef Sandwiches, This is the place to go.  FRESH SLICED Corned Beef.  They make different sandwiches with corned beef.  But these are the best I have had.  They have other food, but I don't ever get the other food... lol I eat there everytime I am at the Cleveland Clinic. It is worth the stop for lunch."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a few years as an alternative to Bob Evans.  The potato latkas are great. Do is the challa French toast.  Fast and friendly service. And they won't let your coffee get too low without a refill.  Sometimes they get swamped and you can wait a bit but it's a great alternative to the regular breakfast spots.  Chris"}
{"text":"I have to give this place props for being one of the only places to serve hummus in all of Solon (seriously) and it was pretty good. The portions here are large, and the servers are friendly. They also do takeout and seem to have a large selections of deli meats.   However, it's very Cleveland in that they are not too big on produce or veggies, it's a real meat and potatoes type of place. Like sandwiches with just meat and no lettuce or tomatoes seem pretty popular. Prices seemed reasonable and it's a nice deli considering most restaurants in town are not. I think they also have a breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Wonderful diner! I look back at my 2012 review of and just shake my head- it's so much better now. Easier to get in and around- lots of light- fresh food- wide variety to choose from. Awesome team of servers and cooks- make you feel like family :)"}
{"text":"I have to admit I am spoiled by having grown up eating Corky and Lenny's and Jack's Deli, but Chicago Deli isn't bad. I went today for the first time with my wife. I ordered the King Corned Beef (because a deli is defined by corned beef) and my wife got a Julienne Salad with ranch dressing. The corned beef came out less than warm so I had to send it back, but when I got it back it was decent. Not nearly as good as the melt in your mouth corned beef from Corky's, but it had decent flavor and the portion was what you'd expect. The side of cole slaw was not homemade, unless it miraculously just happened to use the same recipe as several other restaurants, but it was good. My wife's salad was underwhelming. For about the same price as Corky's Julienne, it had way, waaay less toppings. And none of the meat was sliced which makes you wonder. But the ranch was decent.  All in all, the corned beef wasn't awful, the service was friendly, and the menu had several options. Might return in the future."}
{"text":"They had one of the best hamburgers I've ever had at a \"non-hamburger\" restaurant. Good service. Decent prices."}
{"text":"Really a happening place. Wide variety of things on the menu. I had the French Dip sandwich. My wife had the Reuben. We both liked our food. Service was fine even though they were busy."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places to eat.  We are fond of deli food and George, with his habit of visiting every table, really personalizes the visit.  I signed up for the birthday coupon and was happy to get mine--dragged the whole family in.  Sadly, this visit confirmed what my last few places suggested--the standard seems to be declining.  The food was so-so.  George did NOT stop by.  And our waitress was just downright bad.  Now, I've been a waitress, so I know that it is seldom glamorous or fun.  Our waitress--sorry, server!--must have been having a terrible day, and she thought it would be okay to bring some negativity into my birthday celebration.  She sighed--audibly--and frowned when we were not ready to order instantaneously.  When asked about the specials for the day, she gestured toward the sign board at the entrance.  I could not see that far, and there were people waiting in front of the sign, which discouraged me from walking over.  When I asked her if she would just repeat them for us, she answered, \"Okay. (Sigh.)  Do you have problems with your eyesight or something?\"    The portions were obviously smaller than they used to be, and all of us were disappointed with the taste.  My daughter's French toast was crispy.  My husband's sandwich was bland.  My fish was McDonald's quality, and our waitress was put out when I requested extra lemon.  She also seemed upset by the request for take out boxes, and brought the check moments after our entrees.  She did not refill water glasses or coffee cups.  Worst of all, I thought, was the scene she made before we left.  I used my own pen to sign the credit card authorization and replaced the Huntington Bank pen she brought on top of the little folder.  Perhaps she dropped it--I don't know what happened.  I do know that she came back a minute later and demanded loudly, \"Where is the pen I brought?\"  Several diners looked up from their meals to see what the ruckus was.  When I explained that I had not used \"her\" pen and that I had replaced it, she said, \"Well, I don't see it anywhere!  And I didn't see it?  Are you sure you put it there?  Just check under the table?  Did you put it in your purse?\"  I was so embarrassed that I actually unzipped my purse and showed her that it was Huntington Bank pen-free, holding up the pen I had used.  She scrutinized it, gave another audible sigh, and then left without another word.  We were never thanked for coming, made to feel welcome, or even asked if everything was okay.  I was shocked by the entire experience.  I know from other reviews that not everyone has encountered my bad server and that their food was apparently better than that we got.  Perhaps we were just there on an unrepresentative day.  Sadly, though, I doubt that any of us will ever return.  George. . .gotta monitor those servers!"}
{"text":"I must be trying the wrong thing.  The staff very nice. But not sure where the Chicago part fits in."}
{"text":"We come here sat and Sunday for breakfast. We've tried every breakfast place in the area and surrounding cities and this one has the best food/price ratio.  Like, jims open kitchen is cheaper but the food is bad, first watch has great food but it's too expensive. This is right in the middle. Servers are nice, the owner is nice. My vegan boyfriend can come here and enjoy some Mediterranean dishes, he doesn't usually have options At most of the local places. Place is clean, service is quick."}
{"text":"I come here weekly the food is always tremendous and the customer service is right on the owner always takes time to stop and chat it's just a really wonderful place"}
{"text":"Decent patty melt, but a bit dry. Sweet potato fries were solid. Service was good, but atmosphere leaves a little bit to be desired. I'd have it again, but it's not top of the list for me."}
{"text":"This review isn't about Food. It's about the staff.   If I could give a half star I would. My mom, aunt and I went to lunch. On a Tuesday afternoon in April. The staff was working if you consider talking to each other working then yes they were totally working. When we finally got seated we went through THREE DIFFERENT SERVERS. We had dishes that you could get from a Goddamn Denny's. Actually the waitstaff at Denny's is better than this hellhole. Now I need to mention, that was hardly a soul in the restaurant.   The owner or manager if that's what he thinks he is.  He went around  the entire restaurant and then asked everyone how the food was we told him it was fine he's like \" oh so it's good \"we replied no fine.  He kept looking over at us during the entire time we are finishing eating and it was very uncomfortable.   Now at the end of the meal we paid our bill and then when he said something very disrespectful to my mother. Which really infuriated me. If you love poor and actually poor is  not a worthy word if You Love HORRIFIC  service then this is the place for you! If you don't think completely pass. It's amazing to me with the service is poor is that they are still in business."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, and also work at! George treats all of his employees as family and he personally goes to each and every table to make sure his customers are enjoying their dining experience. Great sandwiches (especially the corned beef and pastrami), breakfast, along with a variety of homemade staples and daily specials."}
{"text":"Consistently good casual meal every time.  We love it for breakfast or lunch.  Omelettes,  deli sandwiches and fries are all especially good. The service is great."}
{"text":"Huge sandwiches and matzo balls. Delicious potato salad, excellent service. Looking around at other tables, i see many other menu items I'd like to try but we're leaving tomorrow."}
{"text":"Best corned beef?  Tired of restaurants giving themselves titles and accolades.  My Reuben was ok, meat was a bit fatty and not stacked that high, sauerkraut was sparse and flavorless, and why dressing on the side?  They also need a stronger rye.  Spicy fries are good and the give you a generous portion.  Service was quick, accurate and friendly.  I just wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"The truest sign a deli knows what it's doing: the owner personally goes table to table to ask how the service was. George knows everyone who passes through his restaurant!  Here is a totally random (but tasty) list of the best comfort food lunch and brunch options at Chicago Deli: - Omelets galore!  - French toast. - Milkshakes. Just trust me on this. - Matzoh ball soup. - Fish fry (for the good Catholics out there!) - Corned beef. Rich and juicy!  As I read the comments about the corned beef, I have to mention... if you want your corned beef lean, ask! They will automatically leave a little fat on for flavor unless you specify.  Most impressively, this can be one of the busiest delis on the east side (particularly on Fridays), but the staff handles it like total pros. I've seen lines out the door, and the service never lacked for a minute. I've been served faster here during slammed times, than I have in empty restaurants in slow times. Other restaurants could learn from their service. It's down to a science!"}
{"text":"Great diner atmosphere with above average diner quality food.  The old adage of \"you get what you pay for\" applies here.  Definitely not your cheap diner type spot but the increase in price matches up with the quality of food.   Chicago deli is a great place to stop if you have a group that wants all different kinds of food too.  The menu is very diverse from traditional Mediterranean to high quality corned beef to salads. Breakfast is also a great option here too!   The staff is always super helpful and the food comes out quickly!  Overall a great spot to stop for breakfast, lunch or dinner.   Protip for parents: sign your kids up for the birthday club and they get a free entree during their birthday month!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while traveling in the area.  Had been there in the past and food was decent.  Heard rumors about the staff.  Well, rumors are true. The servers pay attention to the older regulars and barely say hello to anyone new.  I get better service at ihop or dennys in the middle of the morning.  I don't expect @#$% service at 9AM.  Then the owner spends more time talking to the older regulars.   I give it a two as the food was \"ok\" Next time I'm in cleveland - I'll pass"}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful service! Great Deli!  I have eaten a variety of meals...all great!"}
{"text":"Best Corned Beef in OHIO!!!  In from NYC visiting relatives for the weekend and had the amazing corned beef here. If you're in Aurora or passing through you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Huge portion sizes. One sandwich is plenty for 2 people. Kind of expensive for a deli but the food was good. Conveniently located next to the Cleveland clinic."}
{"text":"We got in our car and left hudson and just decided to drive away from the city till we found somewhere random for something new, we saw the market square sign and remembered hearing of a place in there but then we passed chicago deli and both said let's try it. Saturday 6pm they were jam packed but we still got a seat in like 5minutes took a lil while for our waitress to get to us cause she was slammed but service was very friendly and checked on us often. We got a julienne salad for an appetizer to split and both ordered sandwiches. The salad was huge and overwhelmed us so we took our tuna melt and roast beef n swiss home and i also purchased a gyro to go. Later that night enjoyed the to go order immensely. Would like to try the Matzah cause it's the only place i know anywhere near us to get it fresh and my fiance' has never had it. Good experience, good food and will be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Always a good meal.  No fast food, no cookie cutter restaurant.  American and Mediterranean food.  Favorites are:  Stuffed cabbage on Mondays.  Chicken Shwarma is very good, the best I've had!  Never had a disappointing meal."}
{"text":"I was really unimpressed with this place on my visit here.  I am not a big fan of diner food but since I work in Solon and have tried everywhere else to eat in this city, I figured I would give this place a try.  I ordered the red quinoa lettuce wraps for lunch and maybe that was my mistake in ordering something like that from a diner.  The lettuce was the romaine that you would find on a burger, not the type one would use for lettuce wraps and the quinoa mixture was dry and lackluster.  I was hoping for some big veggies mixed in with the quinoa but all there was were a few tiny red pepper pieces and corn kernels.  The mixture was dry and I had to ask for some balsamic dressing so that I could eat it.  The service was not the greatest either.  While we did receive our food and water quickly, after we had our food we did not see the waitress again until it was time for our checks.   If I came back, I would definitely order something else."}
{"text":"I ate here because I didn't have a car and I had nowhere else to go to get some food. The restaurant looked normal but the options weren't very appealing to me.  I was reluctant at first but I ended up getting a sandwich and a bowl of chili.  It wasn't amazing but it did the trick.     If I stay at the hotel again I'll probably eat here just for a quick bite before I got out but I'd rather travel a few miles to find something better."}
{"text":"the food is good :) its a cute comfortable restaurant the Ben Casey is my fav."}
{"text":"I've been here many times for work lunches as it's right around the corner from my office (never a bad thing to have a great deli nearby) and have always had an excellent meal.  This joint is very much the quintessential deli in every way.         My two favorites here are what the signature of any good deli should be - fantastic Jewish staples of latkes and applesauce as well as matzo ball soup.  Now, I love me some matzo balls, but ordering the soup at restaurants can be hit or miss - oft times, sadly, many places put wayyyyy too much salt in the broth (matzo salt soup, anyone?).  But the base here is impeccably perfect and very fragrant and flavorful, compliment the matzo balls wonderfully. Case-in-point, whenever my fiancèe is sick, I always stop here after work to pick her up a huge container of matzo ball soup. Complimentary, the latkes are also well done, not too greasy and pack a potent potato flavor.  The other dishes here are nothing spectacular but your average good deli food.        All in all, Chicago Deli may not be Katz in NYC or Chompie's in Phoenix, but it's a solid, and delicious, casual joint for some classic deli staples."}
{"text":"I stopped here to grab dinner to go while I grabbed some groceries from the Giant Eagle next door. I got the Beef shawarma and chicken wings. To be honest, I purchased the chicken wings b/c I wasn't sure that I could trust their shawarma. I've had this dish while traveling in the Middle East a number of times and usually LOVE it. Good thing I got the wings because the shawarma was barely edible. I threw half of it out. The beef was cold and tasteless and the sauce was only mediocre. The wings were alright, but basically tasted like the standard grocery store chicken wings. I'm hoping Solon has more to offer."}
{"text":"One of my favorite family restaurants. We eat here at least twice a week. Great service always. Great breakfasts.  Very friendly people working there."}
{"text":"There are a decent amount of lunch places in Solon. Chicago Deli is one of them. I had the matzah ball and half sandwich combo for lunch today. The price was right at $6.99. The corned beef was good, a little on the fatty side. I don't know if they have the option to request a lean cut from the brisket as other places do, if so, that is what I will do next time. The matzah ball soup was my first ever. It was alright. The ball was pretty good for what ever it is. My friend had the pastrami and corned beef combo sandwich. It looked like a sandwich that will automatically spike your cholesterol and blood pressure. I try not to eat cured/salty meats too much so I don't know how often I will return. I saw a sign hanging that proudly proclaimed they carry Bialy's bagels. That is a very reassuring sign. Also, they have a variety of Boar's Head deli meats."}
{"text":"Small place with a tight squeeze but the food is good.  Located in a small shopping center district.  Portions leave you wanting for a little more but I have always gotten friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"A town staple that I have been going to since I was a kid. Great fried bologna sandwiches, awesome selection of platters. Service is good, and prices are reasonable. Doesn't look like much, but it is a great spot for after-church brunch, or just a change of pace from the typical fast-food lunch break from work."}
{"text":"I truly love this place!  It's such a fun diner in the center of Solon and when I say they can do it all, people, I MEAN it!  Are you feeling home cooking?  Italian?  Greek?  Typical sandwiches and salads?  Fluffy pancakes?  Well stroll right in and take a seat, cause they've got whatever you're craving!  The macaroni and cheese I had was simply splendid.  The sauce was the perfect consistency with the best bold cheese flavors.  It was gooey and creamy and the noodles were cooked to perfection.  A tomato slice was placed atop, which paired well as a little topping for the difference of the two textures.  I sprinkled some pepper atop and I was in heaven!  I have also tried the very meaty Reuben.  Their corned beef is out of this world.  Tender and robust in flavor, piled high - seriously, I even removed some, with a fantasticly smooth and sweet but tart Thousand Island.  The pickle served with the sandwich was incredible.  A good dill is sometimes hard to come by.  Search no longer, amigos!  They have different seasonal specials and although I didn't try it, I strongly admired the interesting options they had available for Fall.  One was a homemade off the bone turkey panini with cranberry and pepper jack - it sounded amazing!  The owner is a jovial man who is present and checks on his guests frequently.  You can tell his heart and soul is behind this restaurant, and I am grateful for his attentiveness.  If you want to please a variety of people, Chicago Deli is your answer!  I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place falls within the Denny's genre of restaurants. The owner is awesome--great guy. The food, on the other hand, is OK for a diner."}
{"text":"I know we're in the midwest, but we experienced some of the slowest service ever at the Chicago Deli, to the point where our neighbors at the table next to us said, \"I don't think she's ever coming back!\" I'd say give yourself 15 more minutes than you expect to need if staying in house.  Pastrami did the trick, though. Now I remember why I miss the midwest!"}
