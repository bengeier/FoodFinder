{"text":"May be located in a hole in the wall but really great chicken sandwiches. I love the spicy sauce. It seems like not many people know of it though-definitely better than popeyes! Lots of parking in front too. Right across from bobby's."}
{"text":"The only complaint is that sometimes it takes a little longer than a usual fastfood restaurant.But it seems like the owner leaves a lot of the prep work to be done upon ordering i.e. Taters/Fries are cooked upon ordering as opposed having it already cooked left in tray.  Food is great. Chicken is much less greasier than KFC.Taters are unique and super enjoyable. Their chicken burgers are fantastic especially the spicy sauce.   I come here often for chicken. They are also halal certified. And the owner has had it for over 30 years wow."}
{"text":"There are two things you order at Mary Browns.  Chicken. And Taters.  I kid you not, if you want fried chicken, skip the KFC, and forget the Popeyes.  Okay, go to Popeyes, but only get the biscuits.  Then come to MB's for the chicken.  MB chicken is made when you order it, so it comes out piping hot.  Compare this to both Pop and KFC, who keep their chicken under red lamps for walk-in customers.  MB chicken is deliciously crispy, but the chicken is moist and juicy on the inside.  I dont' mean that it's drenched in oil - i mean it's juicy from the actual chicken.    And the taters... they're indescribable.  Not too salty, not too hard, not dry at all.    Last time I went, we could not even wait to drive the 5 minutes home to eat.  We sat there and just started chowing down, and it was a solid 10 minutes of silent chicken-filled ecstasy.  There was no talking, and the only noise was the smacking of lips and grunts when the hot juices touched the lips."}
{"text":"Ahhh man, their taters are legendary - flavorful and mouth-watering even on their own (cooked in peanut oil). When I lived in Halifax, I even drove all-the-way down to their Lower Sackville location (there is one in Dartmouth now)."}
{"text":"Ordered three pieces of white, got one piece of white, one piece of wing and a piece of \"I can't describe what it was\". Was charged $12 for this. Not recommended. Also, I am sure there are healthier choices available in the area."}
{"text":"Great tasting chicken much better then KFC . But not as good as Popeyes.  They have tater potatoes that was super good . This place is in a old Plaza but the store looks clean and serve was good.  I order a special  $9.99  for 9 pieces if you buy a large Taters  the total as $21.00  They did not offer nothing else like gravy or desert.  I will go back."}
{"text":"Friends who live in Mississauga always told me that Mary Browns is the place to go for fried chicken, and I finally got to try it!   The price is a little cheaper than KFC and Popeyes - our bucket came with our choice of cole slaw, macaroni or mashed potato. They didn't have biscuits, which was a bummer. The taters that came with the meal are AMAZING. Never have I tasted taters that actually come out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I wonder how they prevent the skin from going soggy!  The chicken was a bit underwhelming. They were too oily for my preferences, and I wish the skin was as crispy as the taters. The chicken meat was delicious & piping hot!   The only Toronto location is by Yorkdale, I believe. I'll be going there to see if their chicken skin's got that crisp and definitely ordering those yummy taters!"}
{"text":"Let me say that I quite enjoyed their chicken. It wasn't as crispy as Popeyes but the taste was very distinctive and enjoyable.   The place is more of a pick up the food and leave, although they have few chairs to each there but definitely not for groups. Lets talk about food now, we ordered 2 piece chicken with fries and a Spicy burger with Taters Poutine. The chicken had a nice taste to it and was not watery like KFC but neither was it crunchy like Popeyes. The Burger was quite good but the seller here was the Taters... They were little spicy and cheese and sauce made it amazing.  The service was quick. Overall decent meal!  For my Muslim bro and sis - They serve Halal meat."}
{"text":"Mary Browns chicken is quite good and their tater/fries are nice too. Careful to avoid the excess salt in the taters as you could OD on it if you aren't paying attention. Their lunch specials are a good deal although it's not a huge amount of food. I got the sandwich special and ended up going back to get a box of the taters since they are recommended. Nice, but then the lunch special ends up costing more than planned so not quite the bargain you would expect. This location is small and you can sit on a stool inside or sit on the patio which overlooks the parking lot facing Dundas. There are even a few trees around the parking lot so the atmosphere isn't quite all cars and concrete typical of strip mall dining. Not a bad choice for your fried chicken fix but there are plenty of options in the area as well."}
{"text":"I prefer this to the alternative.  The colonel has served me well over the years but Mary is my new love when it comes to chicken.  Taters are awesome, gravey is OK, but the chicken is by far the better than other alternatives available.  Unfortunately its not close to where i live, otherwise you would see more check ins from me.  But hey, i enjoy it while i can"}
{"text":"I went to the dixie and eglinton new location. Fried chicken is always going to be gross and oily, but this one had really crispy skin and moist insides. It was quite nummyy!! And the taters are really good too.   I like that there there was a one peice. It's enough for the indulgence, and not too much to make you feel like a fat blob. Taters are bit too much carbs, but even tasted amazing the next day after putting them in the toaster oven for a bit.   They were good about subsitutions and getting a certain part of the chicken"}
{"text":"I like there chicken a bit on the geasy side but very tasty , since they closed all the Popeye chicken in Mississauga , Mary brown is an alternative"}
{"text":"Okay, for some reason, all the Popeyes' closed down in Mississauga and I think KFC is terrible.  Actually I really don't like fried chicken, but I had an odd craving for it today.    I ordered a 3 pc combo, which 3 pcs of chicken, taters, pop and side salad and was 9.59.   A bit more pricey than usual, but not bad.  The chicken was tender, had just the right amount of \"grease\" for fried chicken and very big pieces.    The taters were pretty good too as they were salted fairly well. It wasn't super salty, but if you don't like salt at all, this won't be your thing. However I really liked it.  Salad was of your fast food nature. So food was 4/5.  However, a few things I really didn't like the place: -it's not clean.  If you look at their bar stools and look down, the window sills are really dirty.   -The fry cook asked the cashier about her urinary tract infection.  I know he was genuinely concerned and I appreciate that, but imo, those discussions should be held when there are no customers.  And honestly, for the 30 minutes I was there, I only saw one other customer.  I'm sorry, but I don't want to hear about anybody's body before I eat.  So for service 2/5.    Hence, this is why it gets 3/5.."}
{"text":"The chicken tastes normally like any chicken in KFC or Popeyes it's not different flavoured fried chicken. But it's still really crunchy and flavourful."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend, at first I was a little hesitant to try this place out because my friend absolutely sucks at picking places to eat. He hypes up every food place he's been to and then when I go and try it I get really disappointed and tell him that he owes me money for my meal because it sucked. Me and my other friends tell him all the time that his taste buds are broken.  However, this is the only place that he's gotten right so far.  Mary Browns, has really good fried chicken, its not salty like KFC, and its not oily like Popeyes. Their chicken with a plate of rice on the side, amazing. Sorry, its a filipino thing, I love my rice with anything ok haha.   The one big reason that I keep coming back to Mary Browns besides the chicken is the taters. The taters are amazing, everytime I'm there and I hear that a customer is ordering fries instead of taters my heart just sinks. They have no idea what they're missing out on and even when I tell them they still order fries. But anyways back to the taters, they are basically smaller versions of potatoe wedges, however the spices that they add on to them make them amazing, I could just taste one now. And if you add a side of gravy with that, its just drool......  Only downfall would be the prices I would compare them to Popeyes prices if anything, but it is definetly worth every penny.  Items to definetly get:  - fried chicken - TATERS"}
{"text":"Been buying here a little more these days since all Popeyes outlets closed in Mississauga.    The chicken is crispy and the taters are good, but it is a overpriced so I can't really give more than 3 stars. They do not have tuesday (toonie) specials so my business with them is pretty much limited  Will be back"}
{"text":"i love coming here, the chicken, taters, and coleslaw...DELISH!  Basically its a small fast food place, theres some seating outside in the summer, and some stools with a mini table so you can sit down. In reality its a take out place, basically.  Their chicken is better than Kfc and Popeyes, Seriously people.  Theres not much else to say besides the fact that their food is Awesome. You have to come here!"}
