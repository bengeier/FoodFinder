{"text":"Some dishes are not on menu, yet I saw people having it.  Canton fried noodle had way too much sauce and noodle was soggy.  I find it a little over priced."}
{"text":"Tried the set dinner - $30 come with 3 dishes, plus rice, soup, and dessert. Portion is good and food is delicious."}
{"text":"We had been going to Richmond Court for years and we were so disappointed that it closed.  Not because the food was that amazing, but because it was a place that served fried noodles and rice before 11am, had set meals and you could always find a seat.  Well, we have found the equivalent - except, in my opinion, this is better.  Plus, most of the waitresses remained and we were happy to see that they didn't lose their job when Richmond Court closed.  Set breakfast is until 11am, is cheaper and there is a choice of coffee, tea or orange juice.  So happy about the orange juice selection - the kids love it!  My dad loves the free Chinese newspaper (score!) and we like the portion sizes and price."}
