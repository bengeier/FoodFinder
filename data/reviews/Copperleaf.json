{"text":"This place is a new go-to spot for me. Great craft cocktail selection and happy hour prices. They have reverse happy hour as well with food and drink discounts. Bartender was very friendly and drinks didn't disappoint. I also really liked the ambiance here. I'm excited to go back and try their food."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting Copperleaf restaurant with my family. The food is great we found the service to be prompt. I will be back again! Thanks, Chef Tyree for coming out and checking to see if our party was happy with the food and service."}
{"text":"Great new place for great music and great food. The fried pickles are a must and the burger is something special,the chicken enchiladas are definitely worth a try. The menu is creative and offers something for everyone. Check this place out, can't wait to go back to enjoy more music and excellent food."}
{"text":"Great live music. Drinks were good. Bartender called me a \"douche\" and I don't think I deserved it... And I'd admit it if I deserved it. Not saying she's wrong, but it still wasn't very nice."}
{"text":"Great place! Enjoyed the live music and excellent service! Their moonshine is really good too!"}
{"text":"Tried this place three times, after my 3rd visit I decided to rate. Good first; great facility,great food,THE BEST SANGRIA EVER.  Now the bad !!!!!!!!!!!!!! The service is the worst I've ever had anywhere,  from management down, they need to go to customer service school. If they can fix the customer service problem, this will  be a great place to go and tell all your friends about,"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great find in old town Scottsdale! Great drinks, music, and service. Wish we had eaten dinner here instead of just dessert and cocktails...but we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I came in 20 minutes before they officially opened and they were happy to serve me. Great service and the bar tender Sandra made me the best Shakira that I have ever had at a bar! Will definitely be returning to see Sandra and the rest of the copper leaf team."}
{"text":"Ask for the black widow if you want fruity awesomeness! It's got blackberries in it, so it's healthy, right!? Antioxidants and all ;)  oh wait, it's got tequila in it too but you can't taste it. I had 1 drink of it and automatically ordered another!"}
{"text":"The service is pretty bad with no one manning the bar and forgetful wait staff. The food menu is kinda scarce and nothing on it popped out to anyone in our group. I think this would be more of a come for one drink and leave type place."}
{"text":"Amazing new restaurant/lounge in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. Amazing food from small bite appetizers to amazing sandwiches and full on entrees to suit any taste. Great lounge atmosphere and full bar as wells. The beer selection, however, is average and kept mostly local with craft beers but it's enough to get by. They do specialize in moonshine cocktails which are beyond delicious and come in several different flavors."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Beautiful, newer, cozy place just 5min walking from the busy, packed Old Town restaurants.  Live band,  but the music didn't really match the place. Would have been great if a DJ or jazz music was playing.  Moonshine cocktails were interestimg and the Brie app was delicious.  Definitely a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Originally we went in due to a positive yelp rating. Went for lunch on a Sunday. Both my girlfriend and I were very disappointed. Here is the story:  Downtown Scottsdale was super busy. There was hardly anywhere to park, yet we were the only ones in this place. We both felt uneasy walking in when we saw the place was empty, but decided to take the risk.   The place looks cool, and it might be fine for drinks at night. It has a New Orleans feel to it. However, the server was more focused on keeping the empty, already clean bar pristine than anything else. We had to initiate the greeting after waiting about a minute for her attention. During our stay another couple walked in, hung around for 30 seconds and left because no one acknowledged them.   There didn't seem to be any pride in the food. While the menu seemed okay, and the food appeared modern in its plating the taste was very bland. I ordered my burger medium and it came out well done. The veggies were definitely not sourced well, because they had nearly no flavor.   Amanda's Catfish po'boy was 1 color between the fish, the bread and even the veggies; Again, very dull in flavor. After leaving we discovered there was a happy hour that no one bothered to tell us about.   Shame on us for going into an empty place. We drove home feeling like we missed an opportunity. My guess is that this place has some investors, but no investment in a chef. If they did they would be hustling to get people in the door on a very busy Sunday instead of sweeping already clean floors."}
{"text":"This is a nice little gem of a bar/restaurant in downtown Scottsdale.  I was pleasantly impressed with decor, service, and food. Ordered the Cuban Sandwich and it was delicious. I'll be back."}
{"text":"They have a decent beer selection and the moonshine based cocktails are intriguing though I didn't try any of them this trip.  The interior is very wide open.  It seems like there's a happy hour though our server didn't tell us about it, we overheard another waitress telling the table next to us.    We got the grilled chicken sandwich and the burger.  The fries that came with these were a bit soggy and not crispy at all.  Seems like we get this so often lately that maybe it's on purpose?  Meh, we don't like them this way.  The burger came with a fried pickle speared on it which we didn't really appreciate.  Seems like fried pickles (though we aren't fans) usually come with a dipping sauce.  Sometimes you just want a regular pickle to cut through the grease of the meaty burger.  The drunken cheesecake was actually pretty good.  It had the perfect consistency and you taste the alcohol without being horrified by it.  I'd definitely come back for that again.  All in all, this might be a nice hang out spot.  I'll have to figure out what the happy hour looks like one of these days."}
{"text":"The moonjito was delicious! The serving staff is rather young. Our service was slow and at times, non existent. The food was just okay, but I think it had more to do with our server's poor attention our order rather than the food itself. We plan to return in a few months after the staff get their feet wet."}
{"text":"Good place to stop in and enjoy a nice drink!  The bartenders were great, the atmosphere was lively and the drink menu was extensive.  I ended up with a red sangria and really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Paul the manager was rude. Simple questions about the drinks had to come sarcastic answers. Food was blan."}
{"text":"Really great food, we had four different entrees at our table. Wonderful service. Amazing live music."}
{"text":"Bartender is excellent, ask for Sandra. Great happy hour. Can't beat $7 dollar moonshine drinks. Although not traditional the shepards pie was a+++."}
{"text":"Sheppard's pie was really good . Kinda small but enough for me. Could even taste the green chillis! Chuck said the jambalaya was good and the raspberry chipotle pork sliders were really good! On to the tiramisu!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Love the beer, food and Sangria, which was recommended by the bartender, who was also exceptional. The moon-jito was one of the best mixed drinks I have had in AZ. Place was clean, quiet. We enjoyed the meal. We had the shepherds pie, which was like a souffl√©. Small portion but it tasted good. All the food was great, see pics. Overall good experience. With Groupon even better experience."}
{"text":"Everything was so delicious! The raspberry chicken enchiladas were the best! The atmosphere was terrific! I can't wait for the grand opening on the 29th!! Thanks Alison and Todd :) I can't wait to try everything else!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, pork sliders were fantastic! Like the live music. Shepherds pie OK, brisket burger on pretzel bun great!! Love the atmosphere, decor, food, and people. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This was our last dinner stop before heading back home to Atlanta.  The food and service were nothing short of top notch. We will definitely be back when in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"I wanted it to be amazing since old town needs a place like this for the 30-60 yr old who wants to enjoy music and a niight out but thought the service and food was just ok.    The music and location was awesome so I think if they could improve the food options (more flavorful/healthy light bites, and improve the service (the waiters and bartenders were young and chatting together at bar instead of talking to the patrons), I would go back.  We need a cool, hip spot for the older crowd. But the older crowd likes good and nutritious food with a bit of sophistication."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is right in the heart of old town. The food is thoughtfully planned out to teach every taste bud. The burger with pretzel bread was one of my favorite dishes. Every meal should be started out with the Chicharron with creole aioli - don't know where they came up with the concept but they are addictive! The live music and lighting set the atmosphere. Shepard pie is amazing! Every dish is creatively crafted and something to enjoy."}
{"text":"The food is great and the staff is very nice. Great place to have a couple of drinks and relax."}
