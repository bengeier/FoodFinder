5 stars for the patio and the view.  Great view of downtown Cleveland.  On Friday nights, you get a great view of the fireworks from the Indians game"}
{"text":"This bar *is* a hole in the wall, and while that carries a certain charm, it's not enough to earn our beloved 5 star distinction.  Every Thursday night, around 9:30, this dingy joint undergoes a transfiguration when Glenn Schwartz warms up his guitar with a few electrified hymns.  His energy runs high and his chops are unparalleled--a prodigious, bluesy Johnny Cash with a penchant for the pulpit.  

You'll know it's time for the band's break when Glenn lights the room with some verbal brimstone.  \"Our military is filled with gays and women--shameful!\"  \"A bible that's falling apart, is for a soul that's not.\"  The stuffy business men in the room chuckle, \"I think he's talking to you, Jim.\"  Then the room falls silent as Glenn commands the floor.

If you can't handle extreme personalities and viewpoints, stay away.  If brilliant, impassioned, creepy blues guitar doesn't stir your soul, stay at home.  You could drop hundreds of dollars on a night out in downtown Cleveland, but you will not experience the guttural, 5-star thrill that Glenn Schwartz brings to Major Hoopples on Thursday nights."}
{"text":"Great View.  Second time visited.  Felt very isolated not sitting at bar. You definitely have to be a regular to get better service. Was told had keilbasa tacos but tried to pass off ruben tacos instead of telling us they didn't have keilbasa tacos. Ordered appetizer but came after finished tacos. Great view though!"}
{"text":"We just went to Hoopples because I kept hearing about their tacos being good. I didn't care for them. I think the tacos as Park View on W. 58 (Hooples sister bar) are MUCH better.

Regardless of the tacos, Hoopples was having a \"major\" issues tonight with drain flies. As I sat at the bar, I was nearly swarmed by small flies. It was gross.

PS-the view is amazing!"}
{"text":"A staple in the Flats. Love chatting with the locals here and good bar food.  

Oh and the view is fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites.  It is a very casual place with an excellent patio!!!  If you are looking for a place to go where you can just sit and relax and have a good bite to eat, look no further."}
{"text":"Great place to have a drink. Super solid bar tenders. Good clientele. Awesome view! 

That said, don't eat here. I got really sick."}
{"text":"I will definitely NEVER go to this bar again. Norm is NOT a nice person at all. He is not professional. I tried to book the party room upstairs for a birthday. We met and saw the room. He stated it was $150 ($100 Deposit). Food was an option not required. Stated people could order food downstairs. Party was going to be late, therefore we didn't think food would be something we'd be interested in. My friend called to reserve the room and Norm changed his mind about the food stating it was required to order a minimum of $200 worth of food. He had told us when we met that he's had parties of 50 people and they ordered the minimum of $100-$150 worth of food. Not sure what changed. Then I called him a few minutes later and asked him what happen to what we had discussed. He said and I quote, \" I just don't want to do your party\". He didn't give me a reason at all and was rude. Party was like 3 weeks away. Now I have to find somewhere else last minute which is going to be impossible at this point. Very sad about this because I really liked coming here, especially in the summer."}
{"text":"Definitely a working class hero bar with the greatest view of the Terminal Tower and the Industrial side of the Flats. The staff goes out of their way to make you feel comfortable and always keep the libations flowing. Supporter of the Blues as well as other local R&B acts.The food is classic bar food with some ethnic dishes thrown in. Good beer and liquor selection. Someplace where you can always be part of a conversation without really knowing anybody."}
{"text":"Celebrating a 50th birthday with the best view in #CLE. This place is great to spend some time in and have a blast. The folks are great and the view is spectacular. Cue a freighter and a light snowfall and it's a little slice of heaven"}
{"text":"This place checks off a lot of boxes for me...great views, comfortable bar with interesting beer choices and solid burgers.  What more could you ask for in a divey little bar near the Flats?

My wife and I needed a spot close to downtown to grab a quick bite before our show.  Been wanting to try their burgers for some time, and when Dr. J. said she was in the mood for a burger, this place became the obvious choice (to try something new).

We ordered two burgers (which we would split), a house salad with bleu cheese to share and a couple of Irish Ales.  We sat up at the main bar with a picture-perfect view of dusk falling over the city skyline.  Perfect!

The burgers were ordered medium, and although they were probably cooked closer to medium-well they stayed pretty juicy and tasty.  We had the Hoopple burger (with \"special sauce\") and a regular cheeseburger...each came with a side of fries.  To tell you the truth, neither one of us was really jiving on the Hoopple burger, but man were we wrong!  The combination of grilled salami and ham under a blanket of melted Provolone cheese and their special Hoopple sauce was a real winner!  The fries were thin, shoestring style and tasted great dipped in that leftover sauce used on the burger.

We went \"European\" and ate the hot food first and finished off the meal by eating the salad.  It was a loaded plate filled with a variety of veggies and a decent bleu cheese dressing (we had to order extra).

A very satisfying meal, and burgers that hold up pretty well with some of the better ones we've had around the Cleveland area.  Give this place a try, an unexpected find!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a younger crowd (call it mid to late 20-somethings).  We caught Hoopple's on a night of a beer pong tournament so it was extra loud in there.  But still fun.  Great view of downtown from the bar stools.  A Blue Moon draft and a bottle Michelob Light was a meager $6.75.  Um, BARGAIN.  Seems like a great place to stop mid-week after work for a drink and they seem to have a pretty decent live music lineup on Friday nights in the summer."}
{"text":"The view of s about all I can say is good about this place. We come in and it is very busy I ask to order food. The bartender tells me the kitchen closes in ten minutes but says sure I can an order. We order nachos,basket of fries,cheeseburger and a mushroom melt. The nachos  and basket of fries come out, fries are cold but I understand they are swamped. 15 minutes later the cheeseburger comes out. It is completely cold like as cold as the lettuce. I wait about 5 min thinking she would return to the table with the mushroom melt. So went up told her this burger is ice cold and the other one we didn't even receive yet. She says hold on a minute I stand and wait 10 minutes watching her take drink orders while I a paid customer still did not have my food.while waiting after ten minutes Another bartender comes up asks me what I need told her what was going on and she says I will get her another comes up and asks me what I need(still waiting on her to come back) he says the kitchen has been closed for almost a half hour and I still did not get my whole order. Meanwhile she comes up and gives me the money back for the cold cheeseburger and the mushroom melt I didn't get. While it was now 11:55 not may places to eat open anymore. We drove 6 hours and we did not eat since 2pm.  All that she would had to say was the kitchen is closed and we could have went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Hooples illustrates the fact that we haven't evolved much from the cavemen.  We're all just sitting around marveling at the shadow puppets illuminated on the cave walls.  

The only reason to ever come here is to sit outside and watch a game on the projector on the bridge.  Like cavemen, you too will be enthralled by the motion pictures on the flippin wall.  Maybe watching the game will make you forget about the fact that everything else here gets a 10 out of 10 in the junk in yo mother's trunk scale.  

The location is amazing and the patio is amazing, but everything else here is beyond divey.   Not sayin any things wrong with divey, but let's get real this place is kind of gross no matter what, and could be so cool.  

Great view of the city, and right next to downtown make this such an underachieving place.    But yeah, great place to watch a game outside (and show up a little early to snag a seat) or don't waste your time coming here at all."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I'd actually call this place a dive or a hole in the wall.  I'd best describe it as just an average bar.  Something I might find at the end of my street in the suburbs.  I enjoyed it.  I'd also call the patrons there average as well.  Just normal people.  I can't remember the last time I went out to a bar and didn't run into at least 2 or 3 people that annoyed the heck out of me.  It was refreshing and enjoyable.
I didn't really enjoy my burger all that much though.  I think it was too fatty for me.  Also I thought the prices were (very slightly) too much for \"a place with a one page laminated menu\" (as my friend said).  I did love the greasy fries though.  
I'll definitely add this place to my regulars list.  
An average rating for an average place, however I'm willing to bet the more I go here the higher my rating with be in the future."}
{"text":"A great  place  to grab a few  drinks.Norm is a very friendly  owner and always has a great  bar staff.."}
{"text":"This place feels like it has withstood the test of time; buried in the bowels of the city.  The views of our fair city from the picture windows behind the bar are outstanding, especially when there is traffic on the Cuyahoga.  Recently, the owners installed 5 new taps, including 2 great IPA's (Bells & DogFish).  The food has been taken up a notch as well with a larger kitchen providing some of the best spicy Garlic wings - juicy, crispy, meaty, finger-lickin-bone-suckin goodness + great fresh cut fries!  They've got burgers and sandwiches, but I was content eating wings.
On game nights, the patio provides the best seats as a large image is  projected  onto the pillars of the bridge overhead.  They have a bowling machine inside and the whole place has that nicely worn, warm feeling."}
{"text":"Baseball trip to Cleveland. Spent some time with Lisa the day bartender. Great spot with fascinating location. Draw bridge operates outside the huge windows behind the bar. Friendly staff. Cool outside space with live music and sports projected onto one of the bridge supports! Blue collar feel and prices with super hospitality."}
{"text":"Awful! First off the owner of the joint should not be behind the grill cooking. Secondly, as a restaurant owner, you should not run out of main necessities that are on your menu.... bacon and mayo.... thirdly, when you have 4 different people order the same \"hoople\" burger 3 different ways cooked and it comes all the same way back, there's an issue with that. Then when you, as an owner argue with a me as a customer about it not being an an issue. As a paying customer, I have a problem with that and I do not recommend this restaurant/bar as a place for anyone is looking for a new place to visit. The service was good, but the rest of the \"service\"  was the most unbelievable and utmost rude owner ever. DO NOT GO THERE!"}
{"text":"Hoopples is a favorite local bar, it's like our Cheers, to many Clevelanders! Herb and Norm are classic bartenders, knowing your favorite drink when you walk in the door. The fried pickles, buffalo chicken dip, pad thai & chick pea burgers are the best items on the menu! Watching the games being projected onto the bridge is perfect. #thisiscle"}
{"text":"I'll jump through hoops for hoopples!! the views of downtown are simply gorgeous, at night it is an awesome thing to have while your eating dinner or enjoying drinks.

Its definitely a dive bar, typical bar menu, great beer and alcohol selection. The food and drinks are reasonably priced and its a bunch of locals in there most times. Great place to join for a gametime outing.

It has a cheers feel where everybody knows your name. This place might become my new favorite bar.

PS the lobster Mac is AMAZING"}
{"text":"Went again with some friends this past summer. The bartender was a little surly, and there were a bunch of people there from a wedding party. We got shots, beer, and played the \"bowling\" game after escaping from W.25. It is everything that I could have wanted out of a divey bar. I love this place, it's like Cheers, but Cleveland-y."}
{"text":"One of the closest bars to the rowing club, so it sees a fair amount of people after they come off the water.  Wound up here Tuesday night with a few of our team members for a quick one after practice.  Didn't eat a lot before so we decided to split some nachos to go along with our Summer Shandys.  We almost told the waitress after waiting for, oh, about an hour, to forget the nachos...and when they came they were nothing special, definitely not worth the hour long wait.  The others ordered tacos and chicken wings and they came out a good 30 min before our meal which could have taken me about 4 minutes to put together on a plate.

I'll be back here because the patio looks phenomenal and one of the girls in our group said that they project Indians' games onto the side of the bridge in the summer....and because it has a great view of the river and downtown.  I just probably won't be ordering any food again."}
{"text":"This place is a Cleveland institution. Been around for 5 million years...and I can see why.

They have one on the best views for a local watering hole. Nestled far on the west end of the flats, the bridges and waterways are breathtaking. Catering to everyone from the iron workers to the OC trendsters, Hooples doesn't discriminate. The beer selection leans a bit more on the domestic side, but they had enough craft beer for the snobs ;) Not that I'm a snob... but I can't do Bud Light ;)

The food at Hooples is pretty good too. On my most recent visit, I had the mac n' cheese with added bacon. YUM. 

The bartender was really nice and accommodating...especially considering our group may have been a bit obnoxious ;)"}
{"text":"Wow, there aren't very many recent reviews of this place on here. Makes one wonder why the long radio silence since 2011. It probably has something to do with the fact that Hooples stays under the radar and is probably content to do just that. Hell, had it not been for the time my wife and I were told there'd be a 2 hour wait at Merwin's Wharf we'd never had wandered over either. Our impatience paid off, that's for sure.

Friday evening, sometime around 6:30. We drove up to the parking area conveniently located just adjacent to the bar/restaurant/piece of Cleveland history called Hooples. The first thing you'll probably notice, at least I did, is the large patio area to the rear of the main building. This is definitely one of the greatest features of Hooples, hands down. It overlooks the city skyline and one of the historic bridges that spans the Cuyahoga. It's just a fantastic place to be. Walk from the front, look for the arrow that reads \"Patio\" and you'll get there. But what about the interior?

Hoopples is a bar, there's no way around it. The interior is, well, the interior's a bar. I'm not knocking it, it's just what it is. It's maid for drinking, and bitching, and secret trists, and just generally unwinding after you've put in a full day. It's loaded with character and what I can only assume are decades of stickers and stories all over the walls. I really love the rotating refrigerator behind the bar. There's a digital juke on the wall, some vintage-y looking bowling game, sports memorabilia, a dart board, and apparently they've got live music in their \"party room\". We didn't experience either music or the aforementioned room.

As for drinks, it's basically a shot & beer joint with a half-way decent beer selection. I don't remember being given a beer list when we sat down but as soon as they guy mentioned Butcher & The Brewer Stop Hop Kaboom on draught, I knew what I'd be drinking. It's not a craft beer bar, but you'll manage. Ask about their bottles. They just might surprise you.

The service we had during our visit was simply great. I don't know how else to put it other than it was genuine. It's exactly what I'd expect from a real Cleveland spot run by lifelong Clevelanders. No bullshit. No pretense. Just friendly, helpful and accommodating. I never once felt like I was imposing.

While it may just be a bar, they're a bar that serves food. Damn good bar food. Makes sense, right? The kitchen - really more of a coat closet with an oven and deep fryer - is just to the left when you walk in the door. I don't know how they manage with that thing, but they do. The menu's not huge and I think our server mentioned that they were in the process of revamping it so I won't go into any detail. From what I remember it was burgers, sandwiches/wraps a few salads. Not mind-blowing but hunger killing. It was to be a gut-busting session, indeed.

We started with the Hoopples House Salad - just a salad, nothing more. Iceberg lettuce, cukes, carrots, onions, house-made croutons (nice, albeit greasy touch), diced tomatoes and a pile of shredded cheddar. It served the purpose of a salad which, lets face it, is just there to make you feel less shitty for cramming your face later. I did think that the plate they served it on made it nearly impossible to eat without getting half of it on the table. The Italian dressing was tasty, though. 

Next came the buffalo chicken dip. As soon as I saw it I felt my heart react to the message my brain was sending it. \"Best get yer mind right. This is 'bout to happen.\" I don't know what evil genius decided to combine Frank's Red Hot, cream cheese, blue cheese crumbs, and cheddar, pour it over some shredded chicken and serve it with fried pita wedges, but give that man a hand. If you've never had what some people call \"drunk food\" go here and have this.

The burgers are hand-formed, griddled and made to order. Just like the rest of the place, burgers here are not loaded with ridiculous, expensive ingredients and I doubt they'd get away with trying to sell Wagyu beef burgers for $16. They also don't ask how you want 'em cooked. It's their way, so just deal. I got the bacon pepperjack and the wife got the mushroom melt. Both were devoured in minutes and the skin-on shoestring fries joined them. Just damn good burgers.

Hoopples is a piece of Cleveland that I just recently discovered. I can remember driving by it for years on my way to work in the Flats. It looks better now than it did then. I wish I had found it sooner. Maybe I just wasn't ready yet. I am now."}
{"text":"I like this place, but I recently came here because I knew they had lots of tv's and brought friends from out of town to watch a game. We requested a non-Ohio State game to be put on tv and the bartender rudely told us no multiple times because \"this is buckeye country\". If he was nice about it, it would have been one thing but he was extremely rude. then he didn't put our food order in. We left without food or drinks after almost an hour."}
{"text":"Hands down worst bar experience I have ever had. Owner was so irritated to provide customer service. One drink and left."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The first thing I love about it is that the view of the city while sitting at the bar of this place makes the city actually look like an impressively beautiful city.  Seriously, I would recommend sitting at the bar for just this reason.  The second thing I love about it is Glenn Schwartz!  I've been here several times to see him, and he always puts on a great show (even though he is crazy.)  I haven't eaten here, so I can't comment on the food, but the drink selection has always been fine, there's almost always close street parking, and the atmosphere and music are worth the trip alone!  Would definitely recommend this as a cool Cleveland thing to do."}
{"text":"Overall all this dive bar seems to be a typical family setup. You wont find anything super fancy here but it works. The food isn't bad and the beer selection isn't over the top. But that certainly not the reason for coming to this place. You come here with a group of friends or a friend and enjoy each others company while having a few beers and a quick bite. Definitely seems to be a spot that the locals habit. Give this place a try without any super high expectations and it will get the job done."}
{"text":"We came here one late afternoon during the week between Christmas and New Years, and it was a great!  The atmosphere was very laid back and friendly; exactly what you want in your local bar.  The server (I think she may have even been the owner or manager?) was super friendly and welcoming.  We thought it was a good drink selection, too.  I definitely hope to make my way over again!"}
{"text":"Been here many times to see Glenn.  Went early recently to actually eat here for the first time before Glenn and the kitchen was CLOSED!!!  Apparently on a huge night crowd wise, the owner's son wanted to save some $ by not bringing in a kitchen person!

BTW, bartender (Herb) rocks and always has been solid.  A true asset.

OK, the owner's son told us and others we should have had leftovers before we came since it was the day after Xmas!  Nice!  Another couple order food I'm but he would not let them eat it!

Of course we left after the first set to go to a legit place to eat and they lost out on more drinks if they had food. The bartender suffers for poor decisions from management.  Usually a good experience from Herb but not even his great service can save this."}
{"text":"Been going for years.  Usually only time I go here is because someone else wants me to.  Domestic beers and shots mostly.  Food is really good from what Ive had.  Use to be a working class bar but this last Friday night it looked like an episode of Ally McBeal or How I Met Your Mother.  Young professionals \"slumming\" it have one vapid conversation after another...."}
{"text":"If you love to hang out at a hole in the wall bar, this is your place. The drinks are cheap and if you're craving a late night snack, order up their grilled cheese sandwich for $2.50. It comes with chips and a pickle...and if you're nice they'll even throw a tomato on it. With the best view of the city, cheap eats and quarter bowling, you just can't beat it."}
{"text":"If this doesn't scream Cleveland, I don't know what does. Hoopple's has a small but nice draft beer selection, friendly people, Union workers lined up at the bar, and a bowling machine.

I have only eaten here once, and that was for taco night. Those were solid, as was the beer-battered asparagus (healthy!). If you're looking for gourmet food, Tremont's just around the corner.

I'm giving 5 stars for atmosphere, amiable bartenders, and the excellent view of the Cleveland skyline. It's truly a great place to have a beer and bowl a few frames."}
{"text":"I am not sure how my review was taken off the post but we were at Hooples recently and it started with my wife asking the bartender for a recommendation on a burger versus a chicken sandwich.  She was given a rude response of it is bar food.  The next incident was the cook had a tremendous attitude and basically called me out for being in his path to the kitchen. I was minding my own business and the confrontation was very inappropriate and not good for business.  The service was poor at best with major attitudes."}
{"text":"So my first time attending a place based on a yelp review ! I agree with my fellow yelpers. 

Inside, the fake wood paneling, large windows overlooking the river and the decaying industry along it with downtown in the distance. This and the union bumper stickers on the walls gave me the sense that I had stepped into Delores' bar from 2nd Season of the Wire.....

The view of downtown is one that I had not seen before of Cleveland: looking up at the downtown buildings with the river just in front of you.

Our bartenders were friendly and attentive. 

The French Fries were above 'bar' average: Slightly crispy, thinly cut, without being drenched in oil with very light pepper seasoning. My compadre got a chicken sandwich and their beer selection was what I expected - domestics plus Blue Moon, Sierra Nevada, and Great Lakes. I was disappointed that there were no happy hour specials. I was a bit suprised at charging $2.50 for a 16oz PBR (are bars raising prices for PBR to milk money from the hipsters ?)(I must be spoiled with $1 for 12oz at my regular dive bar). 

For a Friday happy hour, the crowd was pretty mixed: some old-timers, some professionals just off work, and some regular Clevelanders. 

I was looking for an unpretentious [guess I'll say dive] bar for a few drinks - found it. Unfortunately, the bowling game is up to 50 cents a game."}
{"text":"tacos on tuesday

{"text":"First came here one Saturday night and was pumped they had polish beer (Tyskie).  Ordered the buffalo chicken dip OMG yum. Ordered the reservoir dogs. OMG yum. Manfriend ordered the hooples burger. OMG yum. The bartenders were engaging and making jokes with us.  Didn't care for the really drunk guy they kept serving and eventually got behind the bar to make drinks, but whatever.  Maybe he's the owners nephew.

After my good experience, I brought some friends here on a Friday night to sit on the patio. There were no beer menus, so I had to keep pulling it up on my phone for them to know what they had so they could order.  Our server was the same bartender I had the time before, but this time she was SO RUDE. I wanted to smack her, she gave us so much attitude about everything. Gah. This isn't Dick's Last Resort, being rude isn't cool. I had to get the reservoir dogs again since they were so dang awesome. We also go the spinach and artichoke risotto things, for the first and last time.  I think the server we had was stretched a little too thin, going back and forth from the patio to the bar.

On the patio, they have a projector that the put the Indians games up on the bridge support. very cool.

I like it here a lot, just hope next time the service is friendlier."}
{"text":"I had never heard of Hoopples before this past weekend when my friend decided to have his birthday celebration there. I definitely think it's a hidden gem, as I've driven past it and never even noticed it. It's in Ohio City on Columbus Avenue but still close to the w 25th bars. 
     When we got here about 8:30 on a Friday night, the bar area was crowded and all the tables were taken, but there was plenty of standing room. As the night progressed, the place got pretty packed. I overheard one guy say that he goes there often, and he's only ever seen it empty or completely packed, with no in-between. 
     Since I had skipped dinner, I decided to order some chicken fingers and seasoned fries. The chicken fingers were thing and pretty average, but they gave you a good amount. The helping of fries was also substantial and was delicious. They season it with some kind of spices and what tasted like a lot of pepper, and they were very good! 
     To drink, my friends and I mostly stuck to beer. I'm a fan of IPAs, and the chicken fingers, fries, and maybe 3 bells 2 hearteds came to I think $25 or so, so it's not an insanely pricey joint for The Ohio City area. 
     Overall my experience was good and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"From the moment I set foot in this place, I knew I was going to be a fan. This is the quintessential industrial working-class dive bar. Complete with union bumper stickers on the beer cooler. Very cool location. Big windows behind the bar not only let in lots of light even on those gray Cleveland days, but also give great views of the working river and downtown. 

Food took quite some time to get to me even on a less-than-packed Tuesday night, but I'll overlook that since we were drinking and having a good time. When I did finally get my patty melt, it was really good. Fries are very above bar average - thin, crispy, with good peppery seasoning.  

Hooples also has a bar bowling machine which is awesome and seems to be a CLE dive bar phenomenon. Never saw one before moving here. 

My one and only complaint about this bar (and the reason it does not get 5 stars), would be my experience the other night when I thought I'd buy the first round for our group of about 8. I ordered 2 pitchers - Dortmunder and Summer Shandy, nothing too fancy. After I got my food, I went to pay my tab and to my utter shock,  two pitchers and a sandwich came to 43 bucks! I asked the bartender because this must have been a mistake, and she informed me that, no, pitchers are $18!

Now, I will admit, I did not ask how much they were before ordering them, but SERIOUSLY? 18 dollar pitchers! F&*%K! I have never, in all my Sconnie-beer-drinking life paid that much for a pitcher. EVER. Even for Guinness and the like. Holy shit! 

Anyway, the food was really pretty good. Much better menu than I was expecting. Beer selection completely adequate for this type of place. I will definitely be back, but I'll steer clear of the pitchers. Damn!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in all of Cleveland! During cavs playoffs season I frequent this place. The food is always good, I've had something different every time and they never disappoint. It's typical bar food but very good. The bar has a huge window behind it that gives you the best view of downtown Cleveland. Seating inside is a little cramped but I really only go there when it's packed. They have a nice patio with a good amount of seating and I love that the project the Cavs games on the side of the bridge. It has a great atmosphere and my friends and I always have a good time when Herb is behind the bar!"}
{"text":"i love hoopples, and if i were more of a bar-goer, i would go every week. really, i give the bar 5-stars because of their AMAZINGGG spinach & artichoke dip!!!! SERIOUSLY, IT'S SO EFFING GOOD with those little pieces of fried pita bread with parmesan cheese. DROOOOOOOOL.

the atmosphere here is a nice, laid-back, with very few bro-sightings in my experience.

but really, the spinach & artichoke dip. #boom"}
{"text":"I love Hoopples. Great Taco Tuesday specials.. 2 tacos with all the fixings $3.50 - choose from chicken, beef or black bean. Had 1 chicken and 1 black bean. The black bean taco is one of the best tacos I have ever had in my life. DELISH! Friendly atmosphere - great view. Great beer selection and has huge patio. Bar bowling, darts.. what else could you want."}
{"text":"Wondered to this place when exploring Cleveland on a Saturday night. It was pretty warm and stuffy inside the bar, so not sure if they have air or not. The outside patio was super nice and loved that they has a projector on the overpass above. Neat little place to check out!"}
{"text":"Major Hooples has the best view in the city.  

Their tacos are pretty good too!

Hooples has a long history of being a Union bar and they still keep that feel.  They've had a mini-renovation which includes a party room upstairs, a decent kitchen and new siding.  Their walls are still littered with old memorabilia from it's life in the 70's including my favorite anti-Jane Fonda bumper sticker.  

I've always been impressed with their service and they'll bend over backwards to make your groups happy both in the party room, down at the bar or on the patio.  

Now, about the tacos (I've been on a Taco Tuesday kick):
They have chicken, beef or black bean tacos.  They're bursting with meat and personally, I thought the chicken was a top-tier taco!  Wash it down with a PBR or one of their drought beers and I call it a good Tuesday.  I especially like Hooples on rainy nights because for some reason it just seems cozy looking over the bar towards the city and seeing the rain fall down on the various bridges.

Anyway, Hooples is top rated in my book.  Glenn Schwartz or no..."}
{"text":"Ok... I have eaten here twice - and it's not just a fluke. Its good. Like - really good. For bar food... 

I've tried the lobster mac & cheese, the lobster quesadilla, and the loaded fries (I told you - I come here for bar food). All were excellent - although certainly imitation crab. Again - keep your expectations at \"bar food\" (if I haven't mentioned that already). But - they do bar food right... and inexpensively.

Stick to beer or a simple mixed drink. The wine menu consists basically of \"white or red\" - but you shouldn't expect anything more than that here. It's not that kind of place.  .."}
