{"text":"The dumplings taste really good!!! 
So far I tried the pork & green bean and the xiao long bao.
The lady was really nice and you can't beat their price. 
I definitely found my go-to place when I'm craving dumplings!
I'm impatient to come back to taste their buns..."}
{"text":"Purchased a bag of 50 pork & leek dumplings for $13.75 (A bag of 30 costs $8.75). The wrappers on these dumplings are thick but it's necessary to hold in all the filling. They definitely did not skimp on the pork and leek. Probably the most jam-packed dumplings I've ever had. Will definitely come back to get more dumplings."}
{"text":"Great hidden little spot on Willowdale! Given that they make their own wrappers, I am never going through the trouble of making dumplings again! All the dumplings are frozen in packages which is usually what happens when you buy raw dumplings (frozen so they don't stick together in the package).

Bought 30 pork chive and shrimp dumplings and 20 (?) soup dumplings...came up to about $16.

The dumplings were meaty - there was a big piece of shrimp in each of the dumplings and the flavour was there! The wrappers didn't crack when they were being boiled/ steamed. 

Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in the Willowdale neighbourhood. I've past by this place many times and I've recently decided to try it out.

They mainly sell frozen, ready to cook, dumplings. I'm a huge fan of the pan fried pork dumplings (potstickers) here. I don't bother ordering them in Chinese restaurants now since I prefer to make them at home. I bought a batch of 40 pan fried dumplings for $13. At a certain restaurant, it would cost $5.50 for 4 potstickers. The dumplings are very affordable and they have many different types.

They also have steamed baos that they serve after 4:30pm. These buns are $1.25 each and they are massive and really delicious. I love how they place the steamed baos in plastic bags. You can also give them a call if you are planning to order a big amount of the steamed baos. 

I definitely recommend trying their pan fried pork dumplings and baos."}
{"text":"The best dumplings!! These are legit. They put a lot of meat filling into each of their dumplings. They make their own dumpling wrappers and it is seriously good. This place just sells their food frozen so when you walk in it's just a small space with lots of freezers. So far I have tried the pork and cabbage dumplings, pan fried dumplings, soup dumplings and their green onion pancakes. Everything was super delicious. Trust me I am somewhat of a dumpling snob. Don't bother buying dumplings anywhere else just get them here. Cash only. I can't wait to try other items!!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer for over 10 years. They make their food from scratch in store. Dumplings are authentic pretty big in size. The wrapping has the perfect texture. The filling is juicy and flavourful, a little too strong to my taste sometimes but I still like it. They also offer other northern Chinese frozen food and have fresh meat and veggie buns coming out from the oven every afternoon that are limited quantity. They also have a Shanghainese food called \"hun tun\" that isn't common in Chinese restaurant. Highly recommend if you are interested in northern Chinese and Shanghainese food!"}
{"text":"This is a dumpling shop where you buy fresh made dumplings.  They are frozen and ready for you to take home and cook.  For $8.70 we got 30 frozen pork and celery dumplings.  You just boil them in hot water, add some cold water and get to boil point again, add some cold water, cover and when the dumplings raise to the top, they are ready.  8 to 10 dumplings per person is plenty.  I had some left over pork chops from last night, and they served as an appetizer and they were delicious.  They are so much better than the ones you buy at the supermarket.  When we were there today, there were no tables, only freezers lining both sides of the shop, so this is not a restaurant."}
{"text":"I agree with other reviewers. Good dumpling, will go back for more.  

I only have negative comment , it is the packaging. The plastic bag is so thin that I am afraid dumpling will get freezer burn in a month. There is no marking or labeling on the bag. They put a little piece of paper with Chinese writing on it, some kind of acronym that I don't understand. I bought a few bags of dumpling, I have no idea what they are when I get home. 

There is another frozen dumpling shop that I have been going for years: 280 West Beaver Creak Rd Unit C8  Richmond Hill  905-707-0828.
Another good place is Dim Sum Deluxe 21 Milliken Blvd Unt 5C. Dim Sum Deluxe lists ingredients and cooking instruction on the packaging."}
{"text":"Great variety of frozen dumplings for even greater value! Beats anything supermarkets, Asian or otherwise, have to offer"}
{"text":"Great frozen dumplings, much cheaper and tastier than your run of the mill T&T frozen dumplings."}
{"text":"I love dumplings, and this place has some of the best dumplings around. Know what you're getting though, and as the store owner likes to remind me, \"there are only frozen dumplings here\". That's fine though, because they offer a variety of delicious fillings on their menu (the soup-filled dumplings are my favorite). They're like the M&M Meat Shops of dumplings. Classic example of sticking to what you're good at, and doing it right."}
{"text":"My favourite dumpling place in town. Authentic Chinese dumplings they offer. Highly recommend the shrimp/chives and the cilantro dumplings. Will go as long as I m still in GTA"}
{"text":"Great food great value. A hidden gem in GTA. Their zong zi tastes like the ones my nanny made :)"}
{"text":"What an exceptional place.

First off, quality of the pork and leek dumplings, Chinese pancakes (chive/green onion) and vegetarian pancakes with a crimped edge are beautifully made items, are EXQUISITE and indescribably good.  The food is prepared with care, very hygienic and lots of variety.  Large turnover, therefore the products are fresh.

Secondly:  so polite and respectful to their customers.  THIS IS WHY THIS PLACE IS SO POPULAR AND HAS BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR SO LONG!

I love this place.  I stock up on items on a regular basis and have never, ever been disappointed.  Quality product, nice owners/staff and just overall good experience(s)."}
{"text":"I love their dumplings!!! They are made in house (downstairs) and everything neatly stored in their freezers. It just takes 7 mins to steam my fav veggie dumplings (prob. 9 mins for the meat ones) and the price was amazing. Better than eating instant noodles right? Last time I bought about 20 shanghai veggie dumplings and two lotus leaf sticky rice for only about $10. Lots of other varieties from buns, dumplings, pancakes, etc. 

The shop is definitely a hidden gem. I'm happy this is in North York and not somewhere I'd have to trek over. 

There is also an english menu but a lot of the other things are posted in Chinese. Too lazy to read lol. 

Will be coming here forever!"}
{"text":"Tried their Pork and Leek dumplings, and xiao long bao, and both were great. The lady was very nice and she will help you select and even recommend cooking methods. 

Will I go back ?? definitely... 

Few tips:
Cash Only and For Carryout only."}
{"text":"My go to place for dumplings in Toronto. They make them in house and they freeze it in these giant freezers. It's not really a sit down restaurant - you go in, tell them what dumplings you want and they open the freezer to give you a bag of them. They're around $16 for 50 dumplings that are much better than grocery store ones!"}
{"text":"It's true that this is a little store front that only sells frozen dumplings but they are quite good and good size. If you speak Chinese it is easier but the lady will help you if you don't. I liek the pain fried dumpling the best, then her soup dumplings although they are a bit small and then her boiled dumplings bc their wrapper is quite thick. 

Would go back to buy more pan fried ones in the future."}
{"text":"Dumplings themselves were quite large, with a large amount of filling.  I bought the pork and chive filling dumplings.  The minor down side is that the dumpling wrapper skin is a bit thicker than I would like.  But I think I would still go back for more dumplings, it's still better than the frozen supermarket ones.  I believe I paid $8 for 30 frozen dumplings."}
{"text":"Really really good dumplings. I'm eating the steamed xlb right now.... so tasty. The only con is I'm going to turn into a dumpling. Yum."}
