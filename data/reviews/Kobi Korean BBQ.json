{"text":"This is the first authentic Korean BBQ I've been to and it's so good! Even though they're super busy and packed. Their service is still quick. Can only make reservations for 4+ people. Always  packed. Sliced pork belly is amazing! Steamed egg is a must try!! So good. Comes with lots of side dishes.

Has alot more than kbbq! Also has hot pot, other korean dishes you can eat. 

Definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Having been to Korean BBQ many times I was intrigued in the \"Chicken and cheese\" dish that I thought to be unique t this location. Friends and I went there Saturday evening. The place was full and no-one was waiting at the front to greet us. While we waited, other patrons walked by us and sat at dirty tables while we were ignored by the staff.  
We attempted to order 3 items, Marinated beef, sliced beef and the Chicken and cheese that brought me there. We were informed that we could not order a single order of the Chicken and Cheese as it was a minimum of 2 orders. Confused by this odd policy since it is listed as a $20 dollar item that can only be ordered in pairs, we opted to leave the item out. Had they allowed us to order it, we would have spent more money.
We ordered 3 beers, myself a Hite Korean beer. The waiter returned with 2 unopened beers and told me they didn't have what I ordered. I switched my order and they brought me my beer with a mason jar. Something that was not offered to the other patrons. On returning to take our order, the waiter spilled my beer and water. He brought me a new beer and left with our revised order. 
The meat arrived with a meager portion of the sides. We asked if we could get more of the sides and were assured we could. Putting the meat on the grill we noticed we didn't get the lettuce leaves that were to accompany the order. We had to ask twice for the lettuce. Having been given no plates, we had to leave the meat on the grill until the lettuce arrived, overcooking it. 
We then noted that we never received the rice that the other tables received. We at the same time asked for more of the sides. The rice arrived after we finished the rest of the meal and the extra sides never arrived. 
The waiter never asked us if we wanted another drink. Never cleared a single plate from our table. Brought us the incorrect bill and provided the worst service I have experienced in a long time. The food was ok but the service beyond bad. I didn't tip the waiter, which I never ever do, because getting nothing was what was deserved. There are plenty of great Korean restaurants in the area so I won't be visiting this one again."}
{"text":"Had really high expectations prior to going here. 

When arriving you have to put your own name on the waitlist taped to the wall. Dont think i have seen this before in any other restaurant. After getting seated we ordered a few appetizers and the sliced beef. The menu is a tad misleading as what you order must be a minimum of 2 orders and you cannot mix and match the items. After ordering we were given the sides which were never replenished. Aside from them dropping off the food they never came back to check up on us or to clean the table of empty plates. Also a first that we had to initially cook the meat ourselves. at other places they will bring you the food, set up the grill and get you started with arranging the meats on the grill for you. for us they just dropped everything on the table and left. the stove was even turned on. the food itself was good. the meat quality was fresh and the side/appetizers were good. with all the other korean bbq type places nearby i highly doubt i will be returning."}
{"text":"The services from the waitress can be improve. Food choice is limited but price is high. Cheese chicken needs min 2 servings to order which is not cheaper but the portion is small. will never go again."}
{"text":"GREAT pork belly I ever had!
Order their specialty beehive pork belly. It's the cuts that make it taste so good on that grill. 
We also ordered squid tempura, which was average. As we ordered two bottles of soju, they gave us seafood pancake and spicy rice cake that's on the hosu"}
{"text":"Went at noon on a Saturday and there was no wait! The service was great - food came out quickly and the servers responded to requests very promptly. All the vegetables they used were very fresh and the quality of meat was good. Cheese chicken was phenomenal (must get) and I especially liked the marinated beef. In the cheese chicken, there was a lot of vegetables and some rice cakes and I felt like there could have been more chicken. Had 2 portions of cheese chicken and 2 portions of KBBQ meat for 2 people, managed to finish but it was quite filling. The complimentary steamed egg that we got was A+: fluffy and flavourful. I'd definitely recommend this place for social (cooking meat on hot plate) and food value!!!"}
{"text":"Realistically, it is more of a 3.5 star than a 3.

I love cheese and korean food so when someone told me this place had a cheese ring where you could dip your food in, I had to try it.

we came for Thursday night dinner and it was BUSY! We waited a solid half an hour if not a little more. The food was tasty, but the a little sweeter than I expected. The cheese was stringy but over time with cooking, became a little chewy. It was more than enough for 2 people. As always, it came with side dishes and a steamed egg soup.

The main issue I had was with the service - it was so slow!! The servers were not very attentive. We had to ask 3 different servers just to get a refill of water. It wasn't that they were all busy, a few of them were just standing around."}
{"text":"When I first walked in this place, a server immediately came to greet us & sat us down. We were given a menu and from reading online reviews , we decided to order the famous chicken & squid pot with cheese. It took about 15 mins for the food to arrive. It is a big serving and can serve 2 to 4 people. The squid was chewy and the chicken was soft. Everything went well with the cheese. Me & my boyfriend couldn't finish the whole thing, so we had to get a take outbox.  Overall, I would recommend this place for anyone that loves cheese and would like to try korean food with a twist."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to Kobi and probably would not come back. As I entered the restaurant there was no hostess to be found. After 10 minutes of waiting, I ending up asking where and whom do I go to place my seats. The host didn't come until another 10 minutes. After placing my table of 3, there was a 30 mins waiting time. I was totally okay with waiting 30 mins then surprisingly 10 mins later he brings us to our seats. As we were seated, they gave us tasty side dishes. At Kobi, every table has a button where you can call the server over. If someone presses the button seconds after you did, you would not get served as there is a screen that shows the last person who had pressed the button. It was very unpleasant to see that you need to make a minimum of 2 orders to order their famous dish. For someone with a small appetite, it felt like the dish would go to waste. We ordered the spicy chicken & squid and cheese dish as well as the spicy tofu seafood soup. Heads up if you do get the dishes with cheese, it has a sweet taste that has corn and pineapple mixed into it; as someone who likes salty food, it was not my cup of tea. The soup was amazing and is holding up the review. It was very filling and came with a bowl of rice. The tofu helped ease the intensity of the heat. From the fast pace of the restaurant, the server would always miss the first thing I mention (such as i ask for a glass of water and another run of side dishes, i will only get the side dishes). Overall it was an okay experience"}
{"text":"cheese, spicy chicken and beer.... how can you say no to this place. service was fast and friendly. try to go with a bigger group and many table items have 2 orders minimum."}
{"text":"I finally went there yesterday with my friends. I read great review and so many picture from instagram before. I went there after 8pm, but there were long lineup. We waited for 30 minutes, but we were fine because the servers were so energetic and nice. Loved their attitude! We ordered Kobe Nabe Soju combo + Spricy rice cake.  The food was good!

I will definitely go back there again :D"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with 3 other girls. We had two orders of cheese chicken and one korean miso soup to share.
First of all, the restaurant is very loud so if you want to enjoy a decent conversation in a quiet setting, do NOT go there. However, when we asked to be seated in the least noisy area, a staff did direct us to this side of their patio, which was okay.
There is a minimum order of 2 for the cheese chicken dish. You can mix with seafood option but we decided to go with two orders of chicken.
It was our first time trying this dish so we had to ask few questions (when to mix, amount of time to cook, etc) to the servers as they passed by, and I was impressed how they were so courteous and helpful. They came by few times to adjust the heat as well.
The food tasted pretty good. Their spicy sauce and cheese actually went well together and the steamed egg that came as a side was good as well. The korean miso soup (fermented soybean soup) was, however, not as good. Okay, but not great.
I would go back if in a group, and next time I will try cheese seafood dish."}
{"text":"Good Korean BBQ place for groups. They require you to order at least two orders per table cooking (like BBQ or the stove top). I went with a group of 7 and we ordered 3 orders of the chicken and cheese and one order each of the bbq pork belly, sliced pork belly and sliced beef. The chicken and cheese go so well together. Wow would definitely recommend. The meats were good and prices are better than some other restaurants in the area. There were 6 or 7 or so different apps but in tint dishes so we had ask for refills many times. But overall the service is fast and food is good."}
{"text":"Great Korean BBQ place!  This place's main speciality is not pork bone soup but BBQ items and cheese pot.  First of all expect a little lineup when you show up for dinner,  then expect lots of choices of Korean food on the menu.

This is my second time here and I would definitely return to this place.  Their BBQ is good but the meat could be more thicker because with thinner meat, they tend to dry out on the grill fast.  I have also tried their cheese pot with chicken, it was really good in the beginning but at the end I got sick of the cheese, luckily it's on the outer ring of the pot so I could still finish my chicken without having to finish the cheese.

By the amount of business they get, it 
seems like a restaurant that would last for a long time, it's got a custom built patio which is nice during the summer.  

I don't think this is the place if you just want to have pork bone soup as it's speciality is really BBQ and cheese pot.   For pork bone soup, go somewhere like Owl.  I think almost everyone who comes here gets one of the two and with additional Korean dishes on the side.  Lots of cubicle style seating, not sure if that's the correct name, so it's baby friendly if you bring the car seat.

The small side dishes were good, they offered to refill without asking which is good service.

Price is reasonable, I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Pictures look absolutely tempting. Nothing great about the spicy chicken with cheese and it's certainly overpriced. The place is too busy and servers keep forgetting our order. We only get water and glasses at the end of our meal. I wouldn't wanna come back again"}
{"text":"I've seen pictures of their chicken and cheese online prior to coming to this restaurant. And it tasted just as good as it looked. We ordered their chicken and cheese and squid and cheese, and added some udon noodles to it. It was very tasty."}
{"text":"Pretty good value for the amount of meat.
Great service, live the steamed egg that came with BBQ order, very unique."}
{"text":"As soon as you step in the restaurant, the mix of Korean BBQ and spicy chicken cheesy-ness aroma will envelop you. The wait was quite long as they food is very tasty. Spicy chicken mixed with the cheese gave off an interesting smokey flavour when combined."}
{"text":"First timer to the restaurant even though I walked by it weekly.

Very authentic Korean Food.
Food taste good and come quickly.
We order the beef stew and beef bibimbap, both serve in stone pot.  They give us 5 side dishes and give us free refills.  They also serve cold wheat tea.

The service is good.  They have the bell button like most of the Korean grill restaurants.  We rarely find a need to press it.  They check on us a couple times, knowing we are newbies when we do not know what to order for the menu (we wanted to try the soup noodles but chicken out when we found out it was pretty plain noodles in fish broth, by we vow to try it next time).

Lots of parking available in the plaza.

Overall a good experience and I will return."}
{"text":"I visited with my friends and ordered spicy chicken with cheese. The richness of cheese went along very well with the spiciness of the chicken. I anticipated that cheese or the chicken sauce would be burnt on the bottom, but that never happened as the servers checked every so often. We also ordered fried rice on top of the chicken. It got pretty expensive but was worth it.
For sure I would like to visit again."}
{"text":"My first time trying kobi due to a friend's recommendation and I'm glad I tried it but I probably won't go again. 

I really liked the atmosphere and service was great but the area felt a little cramped due to how many sauces and side dishes were on the table. We ordered two portions of chicken and pork belly and the fish cakes. I loved the chichen! Flavor was so good and just enough spiciness to make me feel the heat. 

Pork belly was very expensive for the quantity and I felt like it just wasn't worth the work LOL maybe we just weren't that good at cooking it. 

They gave us a ton of side dishes and sauces which was awesome. There was a good variety and we literally had no places to put our hands. It was a good experience but I'm not sure I can justify going back again due to the prices. However, I'd recommend everyone to try it once because it is quite special :)"}
{"text":"Food 4/5
We ordered the spicy chicken with cheese (min. 2 orders) and pork belly for table cooking (also min. 2 orders). The food arrived fairly quickly and before we knew it, the table was covered with our orders, side dishes and steamed egg. To start, aside from the egg,  the other side dishes can be commonly found at other Korean restaurants. The egg came piping hot and was fluffy yet juicy with a nice broth. The spicy chicken was served on a hot plate with a mixture of rice cake, potatoes and cabbage surrounded by shredded cheese. Once the cheese is melted, you can dip your chicken in it which toned down the spice. The pork belly was a bigger cut compared to certain restaurants that give you slightly thicker versions of bacon. It's not cooked on the normal grills which was definitely better since it was less greasy and was fine to eat without rice. A soybean paste stew accompanied the pork belly which wasnt too strong in flavour but was a nice to the greasy meal. 

Service 4/5
When we first got there, we notified them that we were still waiting for another friend to arrive. The staff were very understanding and didn't rush us but also didn't provide us with tea until we asked. However service did turnaround once our food arrived. The staff were friendly and came by frequently to check on our food, served us each dish and even provided us with freebies (pancake and extra order of steamed egg). Another thing I appreciated was the staff would continuously come over to clear anything to make more room for us. One thing many Asian eateries lack is they generally clear everything after you leave. 

Overall, service was great after the initial hiccup. The food is also very satisfying on a cold night or if you're looking to optimize on cheat day!"}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place based on all the good reviews it got o  Yelp. However, tried calling to book a table for 2, but the representative on the phone would not allow me to book for 2, telling me to \"come and see\". Upon arriving, found out that tables could be booked for parties of three or more. What's frustrating is that their tables for 2 are the same for parties of 3 or 4, so I don't understand, nor agree with, why they do not allow you to book for 2. What we would have ordered would not be less than that of 4 people, especially since they enforce minimum two orders on a few of their popular menu items.

If you still want to come here, would strongly recommend booking a table in advance, and remember to say you have more than 3 people when they ask. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Wait time: Party of two came on a Sunday at 6:30pm and had to wait a bit over half an hour. Daylight saving ended that night so its' more like the hunger of 7:30pm may attribute to why there were a lot more people.

Food: ordered the spicy chicken and cheese and it was only ok (minimum of two orders). As we were a party of two we really couldn't order anything else. It's not the kind of cheese that I like it was the stringy white cheese similar to cheesestring. I prefer Joons for the cheesiness. I prefer Home of Hot Taste for spiciness and flavour. The difference is in the offering and presentation of the food. The chicken, dukbokki, cabbage, onions, and I think yam slices are in the centre with the sauce. The outer ring is of cheese corn and pineapples. You have to wait a bit for everything to cook and the cheese to melt then you dip all your food in the cheese. 

Service: The host was friendly and tried to get people and put there info onto the infamous white board. Kept reassuring us of the wait time and checking in once in a while. The servers, some spoke english and some had broken english but all very polite and smiled a lot which I appreciate. it's busy so in terms of attentiveness they aren't very. Which is probably why they installed a \"call\" button system. 

Pricing: single serving of chicken is $18.99 so the minimum of two orders is $37.98 before tax and tips. For that price and only trying one dish wasn't particularly economical to me. I think if you go in a group and try a lot of different dishes it will be more worth it. 

I won't come again unless my friends who have never tried want to go in a big group. That way we can also get reservations. 

Happy Fooding!"}
{"text":"My first time here, I came to try the Spicy Chicken & Cheese. This place is nice and large. The staff are super friendly and kept asking us if everything was okay. 

The food itself was good. The Spicy Chicken was not too spicy, coming from someone who can't handle spice. The cheese was good with the chicken, but I wish that the cheese would stay melted. It started to thicken up near the end. It's $18.99 for the Chicken & Cheese, BUTTTTT you have to order a minimum of 2. So... $40 for one dish.. kind of pricey.. 

Everything here was fine, but we also found a hair in the kimchi.. not a huge deal since we didn't eat it.. but.. beware. 

Overall, minus the hair, it's a pretty good place and I would come back, but with a group of friends since the dish is so big."}
{"text":"This branch opened not too long ago, multiple locations already in Toronto. Since they're fairly new, they're quite understaffed. However, food quality is still great. I had the cheese booldak and cold buckwheat noodles, both very delicious and with fair prices. Friends have told me the regular korean bbq is quite good as well."}
{"text":"Great BBQ place. Tried their pork, beef, and chicken with cheese. Don't cook the cheese too long, it gets pretty hard and salty. The chicken has a good amount of spice and lots of veggies. The beef is fantastic, one of the better marinated beef I've had around Toronto. Service can be a little slow if they're busy. They seem to be a little disorganized and forgetful when the place is full but there is a bell you can ring for their attention. Generally friendly service and good food. I come here often for BBQ and drinking."}
{"text":"The 9 of us came by for dinner last night as we ordered:
- two pork bone soup
- spicy chicken and spicy squid cheese
- pork belly bbq
- two seafood pancake
- spicy rice cakes
- cold noodle with bulgogi
- steam eggs

We completely dusted everything. Overall, the food was good, the cheese platter was definitely different so I would recommend trying it. Their cold noodle was good. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy their bulgogi (very dry) and their pork bone soup (lacking flavours).

We did make reservations so we were seated immediately in our own section. Service isn't that great, we had to run out to find someone because their bell wasn't working and their staff isn't very attentive.

Unsure if I'll be returning. The PBS was a complete bust."}
{"text":"Can't believe I have to give a 3 to something with cheese, but it just wasn't that good. We had spicy chicken and squid between 3 people. I think I prefer the chicken a lot more, the squid isn't really good quality. I found the whole thing not flavourful at all, maybe if we asked for more spice it would have been better, but there was nothing at all special with the taste. It was super filling with all the cheese and we also added udon, which I did like. Service was really attentive and kept helping us with our plate. Still, even though I love cheese, I really don't find anything special about this place."}
{"text":"This place is so adorable! I came here during the holidays and it had the coziest ambiance. There were little Christmas decorations along the little group-friendly booths and wooden tables. Everyone working there was Korean and they started talking to us in Korean before we told them we didn't understand LOL. Their English is not the best, but they try very hard and is easily comprehensible! :) 

We wanted to try the spicy chicken and squid with cheese BUT also wanted to grill some pork belly / beef. Unfortunately, it was minimum two orders of either or! We chose the spicy chicken and squid with cheese since it was more unique. It came with a steamed egg dish. It was probably the best-tasting steamed egg I would ever eat. It was so light and fluffy. When the main dish came, everything was probably cooked but not ready to eat yet. The waiters came by to set up the cooktop and stirred it for us occasionally. TBH, it was really delicious, new, and fun for the first several bites. But after a while, when it's the same big bowl of spicy-sweet sauce and as the cheese begins to solidify, it gets a bit boring. It would probably be better with larger groups so you can order a lot more different things and eat less of each."}
{"text":"If you want to come here on a weekend, definitely make a reservation. If you want to come here without a reservation, definitely arrive earlier. 

I've heard about this place from blogTO and I definitely had to try it out since I love Korean food. I came here on a Sunday night at 5:30pm with no reservation with a party of 4 and had to wait at least 45 minutes to get a table. 

The menu is quite simple as you can order either the spicy chicken or the table bbq. We usually opt for the bbq because a couple members of my party cannot handle spicy food. We ordered two portions of marinated beef and two portions of samgyupsal (pork belly), seafood pancake, and the street food style oden. The meats come with soybean paste stew in the middle and also comes with rice and steamed egg. 

After 5 minutes of ordering, all the side dishes, meat, and grill were on the table. Our table was filled to the brim with dishes as we had to do some table management to fit everything in. The meats are fresh and good quality. You grill it yourself and who can say no to that freshly grilled meat? Just hearing it sizzle makes my mouth water up. Seafood pancake is a good deal for the price as other Korean places charge way more for it and it tastes excellent. The street food style oden is pretty unique as it comes with fish cake skewers, udon, mussels, eggs, and dumplings. This is probably one of my favourite dishes. Who cannot say no to all those! After all the deliciousness, I am put in a kobi food coma. 

Overall, great place to eat Korean food in general. It is a very popular place and your clothes will smell like BBQ afterwards so hopefully they can improve the ventilation system."}
{"text":"Went here last week Friday with the wife lady. Had the kalbi and pork belly. Had good time. Was it a fluke? A mirage? A meat illusion? Only one thing to do. Go back the next day, take my Korean mom and dad with us to make sure (Coincidentally I am also Korean). Mom and dad, they knew the time, and they gave this place top billing. Dad was especially impressed by \"not having to pay\" and \"yeah, I left my wallet at home so...\". Mom advised ahead of time that I would be happy to buy her dinner. Jokes on them because the prices are incredibly reasonable for the quality, and variety, of meat and panchan that are offered. 

The service was pretty dope as well. The servers were super attentive. All in all I would certainly categorize the meals I had on consecutive evenings as \"lit AF\". AF stands for \"awesome food\", FYI. 

So, do yourself a favour and enjoy a meal at this sick ass restaurant. You won't regret it, fam."}
{"text":"A little pricey, come here with your squad or expect to go broke. [We came for the BBQ]. We ordered cheese BBQ (to order one you need to be at least a party of two or it'll be $39). We taught each other how to eat the pork with lettuce, it was great. The sauces were great, garlic-y and spicy. Cheese was more like fun, it wasn't any special cheese. The pork slices were a little bit expensive btw.

Overall it was a great experience but a little bit gimmicky."}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's birthday dinner.
 
This place is located just west of Yonge and Steeles, pretty easy to find.

I have always wanted to try this restaurant after seeing everyone coming here for the spicy chicken with cheese dish, and of course i ordered the same one.

We ordered the spicy chicken with cheese in mild for 2 orders ( minimum order is 2 ) it came with 5 side dishes and steamed egg in a bowl. 

The chicken mixed with cheese was so good!!! Love the cheese - it helps make the chicken less spicy and the dish was huge!! We couldn't finish and had to pack the rest.

Definitely must try this place !!
I saw other people ordering the barbeque set for pork/ beef.. that's something i definitely want to come back to try as well.

Price was not too expensive either- it's a bit more than the usual korean food, but for the amount of food you are getting - it's still pretty decent."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try this place out since there were good reviews about this restaurant (and also because I wanted to eat the chicken with cheese too~). When we walked in it was super packed! We had to write our names on the board and there were 12 tables ahead of us. We waited for about 45 minutes before we got our seats, which isn't that bad.  We ordered the chicken and cheese (2 portions) I think the chicken and cheese was pretty good, but two portions was really little compared to how much we thought there would be. We also ordered the pork belly, salted BBQ beef, marinated beef ribs for the BBQ portion and I would say that it was pretty delicious! I would definitely come back again, but maybe during the week days so it won't be as busy."}
{"text":"Came here 4 times now. Twice for lunch and twice for dinner.  The lunch menu is pretty good and portion is big.  $11.99 for bulgogi rice and $10.99 for spicy pork rice.  A lot of banchans too as they keep asking if you want more.  

Dinner we had the cheese ring spicy chicken and squid combo which also comes with steamed egg in a bowl.  Minimum 2 orders for this.  Place is usually packed at night we had to wait 30 mins or so."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday celebration for 11 people. 

Location/Service
Interior design wise was nothing too special. They do have a patio with KBBQ grills available, which brings back to the time when I was in Seoul (very local and authentic). 
As for service, we went on a day that were understaffed. They didn't anticipate the patio would open so food orders took a bit slow.  Also it took a while for them to get us utensils. I would suggest you walk up to them directly or dig around assertively. 

Food
Tried both the spicy chicken and spicy squid cheese pot. What's interesting is the cheese are on a separate edge of the pot - sort of like fondue, you pick up food and dip it in the cheese! Tip is to watch for the heat, which can harden the cheese pretty quick. 
Also tried the Kobi Nabi, which is Korean street food (fish cake, egg, noodles soaked in broth). Typical street food deliciousness and they separated the food with a divider to give that local authentic feeling. 
Finished off with the KBBQ, both beef and pork belly. They were thinly sliced so easy to cook, but I feel a little short in terms of quantity. The grill also has a small soup in the middle for you to wash up the meat flavor inside your mouth. 

Overall, it's nice to come for the authenticity. Food quality wise was alright and it is a little bit on the pricer end. I would come again to try their bimbimbap and cold noodles. 

If you do plan to do a bday celebration, I would suggest you talk it over with the staff first as it wasn't executed too nicely (lack of utensils and did not cover up the element of surprise."}
{"text":"Came here for the cheese bbq! Its across centre point mall in the plaza where service ontario is. They have 2 options for the cheese bbq: chicken ($18.99) and squid ($19.99). You can also customize the spice level. The food came pretty quickly and it was a fairly large portion. Cheese can fill you up pretty quickly so near the end we got very full. And like most korean places, they serve it with their side dishes of kimchi, japchae, etc. It was very delicious would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"It is by far my favourite korean BBQ restaurant that I've been to. From food to people, it's all around a 10/10. Fair warning: the restaurant gets supppper busy during rush hour dinner time, so I would go ahead of time and have dinner a little earlier or sit and wait for a seat.

My recommendation would be the KBBQ; the chicken and cheese is \"eh.\" Once in a while, I would say it's okay, but like...no more than once every half a year to a year. It's overly oily and although delicious, not all that satisfying. However, their BBQ I love. I have yet to bring anyone that doesn't like the restaurant. The thick cut pork belly ($15.99/one serving - which is three strips) is delicious, SO good, thick cut, crisps up beautifully. So good - our go to dish when we're here. When we're a little fancier, their marinated beef ribs are also DELICIOUS ($24.99/one serving) fairly more expensive but also far higher quality meat. BBQ comes with dipping sauce, onions, lettuce wrap; a soup in the middle of the grill; steamed egg and steamed rice. 

Their seafood pancake appetizer ($6.99) is one of my favourite seafood pancakes anywhere that i've been. Their dobboki is HUGE for an appetizer - could be eaten as a main ($9.99). At times that I've gotten it, it's a little too sweet; other times it's spicier so I would say that consistency isn't spot on but will fill you for sure. 

The people there are alway so lovely and happy to serve, the food is always great, high quality and delicious and satisfying. Definitely worth a try; and believe me, you'll go again."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this place. We arrived 5:45PM and there were already a lot of people but had a table within minutes. 

We were 3 adults with two kids and we ordered the pork belly and marinated beef for the BBQ, a pork bone soup, and a cold noodle. When the food arrived, our table was completely covered!

All the food was delicious and very filling. The only negative would have been the lack of ventilation. By the end of our meal, the whole dining area was thick with smoke. Otherwise, we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night and the place wasn't that busy. 

Pros 
-Service was quick 

Cons
- We purchased the spicy chicken and spicy squid with cheese ($40) and most of it was onions and rice cake. Squid tasted terrible. The few pieces of chicken in there were ok. 
- Food is bland. 
- Overpriced for the portions you receive."}
{"text":"Wow. So impressed with the quality of meats and pricing. The seafood pancake was only $6.99 and had giant pieces of shrimp. Typically I never order this since at other restaurants can be pricey ~$15-20. Got hungry, devoured and forgot to take a pic. 

The meats- we got kalbi and pork belly for $25/$15 respectively. This was served with some lettuce wraps, spicy lettuce and green onion mix, garlic, jalapeños, onions, soy sauce dip and bean paste. The middle of the grill had a bubbling bowl of spicy tofu soup. This also came with the egg soup! Perfect for a freezing winter day. 

The reason they lost a star? Unlike many well vented kBBQ places with additional fans. This restaurant does get a bit smokey, so leave your jacket in the car."}
{"text":"This place is really famous for their authentic Korean food, and my Korean friends highly recommend this place. This place was really well kept and clean.  It was funny the light got dark twice as I thought it was someone's birthday, but it was just too much electricity consumption the switch jumped couple of times. 

I love kimchi from all Korean restaurant, but my favourite us the ones with a sour and sweet undertone from pears.  I didn't really like their kimchi as I found that they put too much sodium in it, and the slice sweetness from the chilipepper didn't shine thru.  The pork belly nontheless was flavourful and fresh as they were marinated and griled to perfection.  The outside is so crispy with juicy interior.  The tofu seafood soup was the bomb with silky smooth tofu and really intemse seafood flavours.  Love it!  Beside the pork belly and tofu soup, we had the squid and glutinous rice cake marinated in the red sweet and spicy sauce and finished with melted gooey mozzerella. It was simply decadent.  My only complaint was that since the food is a little pricey, we didn't order much.  

The service was really good from couple of the servers, very attentive.  I still think we didn't order enough food as I was still a little hungry after the meal.  It ended up being $23.00 each for seven people. I want to go back next time and order more food.  lol!"}
{"text":"Was here on a date and we ordered several rounds of beef and pork belly. Called and asked if this was AYCE BBQ and a second time, sat down and asked it was AYCE BBQ (before ordering) and the answer was yes to both.

....the bill came to $100+ for 2.

Turns out, it wasn't AYCE. Luckily, I could afford it, so I didn't make an issue about it and paid up, but I wouldn't go here again. The food was ok, but nothing worth making a special trip for, esp not when they lie to bring customers in."}
{"text":"It was a nice atmosphere with such welcoming staff. We came with our 2 little ones, ages 4 and 6 and it was great. They really enjoyed their experience. What we had was delicious; beef spare ribs, pork slices, pork belly soup, and the dukbokki. Our order came with rice and all these wonderful sides that they included. Overall a great restaurant. We will definitely be returning during our next visit!"}
{"text":"We came here and ordered the squid and chicken with cheese. You  have to order a minimum of 2 orders so really, it was close to 40 dollars. There's a call button to catch your servers attention which is really convenient and service was fast. Our meal came out in about 10 minutes and boy it was filling! Couldn't finish it all ...ideal if we had a third person. The sauce was not as spicy as expected..more sweet and after a while of eating it, it becomes almost too sweet to enjoy. Service was great. Taste for the price was decent."}
{"text":"Relatively new in the area, Kobi have already made it to my list of one of the favourite Korean food places in Toronto. Their seafood and cheese dish is quite special - try it with extra spicy sauce you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The food is very good here. 
For sure you should Try the BBQ and the chicken or seafood cheese hot pot. 
Super good, with Korean flavour. 

No one pick up the call for reservations, when I first time went there, I had to wait for about a hour.
So, if you plan to go , better be there early."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times but this visit was the most disappointing.  We ordered chicken and cheese as usual but the dish was not flavorful, cheese was not even melty.  To top it up, the amount of cheese was half of what it used to be. You know it's not great when there's soju left over after a meal!! 

Sadly to say, I won't be coming back here again. There are so many Korean options in the area."}
{"text":"Rating: 4.3/5 - food wise is pretty good, but minimum order is 2 servings n u can only pick either this or #kbbq, can't have both at the same time, only worth it when going w a group of 3+ ppl; b prepared to wait at least half hr for ur table as it is pretty busy most of time

{"text":"I went on Saturday afternoon for late lunch and the place wasn't as crowded as I thought it would be. Server greeted us and we were seated immediately. There were 3 of us and we ordered spicy chicken and cheese (min order of 2) and a bibimbap - plenty of food and we had to take the leftover home. The sauce of the chicken and the melted ooey gooey cheese complement each other very well. We also love the steamed egg soup - very fluffy. Overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Horrible place. The thin pork belly tasted fine but it's super hard to manage on the grill, the thick pork belly is just horrible. The beef taste fine but the portion size is really small. Overall the price is too high and food are disappointing. Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"The snow lately has been making me crave for some warm, bubbling korean food! We decided to be a bit more adventurous and ordered the tofu and intestine casserole. The tofu and the vegetables (wintermelon, lettuce, carrots) were great. However, I was not a big fan of the intestines and found the taste and texture to be a bit off. Maybe next time I will stick to BBQ-ing some regular cuts of meat!"}
{"text":"I found my experience with this restaurant to be much less satisfying than I was expecting, given the stellar reviews that I had read beforehand. Perhaps I should have paid more attention to the 2-star and 3-stars because their experiences were more in-line with my own.

I made a reservation a day in advance, as some had mentioned it gets really busy.
And indeed, it was really busy. We walked in and noticed about a dozen people sitting in the waiting area. Fortunately we had reservations so that was not an issue. I then noticed that there were many empty tables, which was a bit confusing until a friend pointed out that they were all reserved. So...if you can get reservations in, do it.

The restaurant looks nice and clean. They occupy two units, so there are two entrances up front leading to two different areas, but then you realize they're both connected in between. There are decorations here and there, with nice black walls between tables. There are several booth rooms for medium-sized groups (4-6) that are pretty nice. Each table comes with a bell that actually works unlike some places. Washrooms were no good though, compared to the dining area.

Their menu comes with some usual korean dishes like stews and bibimbap and stuff. 
They have a nice collection of drinks to choose from.

Flipping over towards the end, you'll see their table BBQ section. The way it works here is you must order at least two orders per table. Most of the items count as one order, so you're going to have to get two. In terms of cheese BBQ, they have spicy chicken and cheese, squid and cheese, as well as a seafood and cheese (which comes with a bunch of different seafoods). You're basically looking at $40 per set, which is good for I'd say two people.

They also have meat BBQ. Again, minimum two orders. You get some plain pork belly or beef rib options, and some marinated pork/beef options. When we asked about how much meat we'll actually get, the waiter specified that it will be around 225 g. Now, if you think about it, that's half a pound of meat for $18 to $25. This better be some amazing meat if they're charging like $50 a pound (to put this into perspective, you could get good southern BBQ for around $20-$30 a pound, and decent AYCE korean BBQ for $20-$25)

We decided to order two orders of spicy chicken and cheese, and two orders of marinated meats (won in votes compared to seafood and cheese). When the food came, a lot of stuff was put on the table: two cups of lettuce, 5 side-dishes, a bowl of onions, vinegar and sauces, a bowl of steamed egg, a second portable stove, and two platters of meat. Basically, the whole table was filled. While it does look impressive, there isn't actually that much in terms of food. And because there was just so much stuff on the table, you'd have to figure out how to work with it.

The side-dishes came with a few pieces each. This means you're probably going to need to get a lot of re-fills if you really like it, but they don't really have too many waiters available and getting ahold of them even with the bell can be difficult.

There wasn't much meat. Well, it's 225g, so that's kind of to be expected, but the quality wasn't even that great. They were all pretty thin and didn't taste or feel that great either. Then again, I was in charge of the grill and I have basically no grilling experience, so perhaps it was my fault that the ingredients weren't used well. I don't know.

The spicy chicken and cheese is probably their specialty since it's on their store front, but I didn't find it to be anything special. They add a lot of things to it that aren't chicken, and then they mix it up in the spicy sauce so that everything looks orange. But there was probably a dozen pieces of chicken or so. Split that between a group and everyone gets...not much. It's all the extra stuff like vegetables or rice cakes that they add that makes it look like there's a lot going on in the pictures. The cheese was ok, but it goes out pretty quick.

In hindsight, given that we knew how much meat we were going to get, probably should've went with the seafood and cheese platter. Any AYCE KBBQ would be better. You'd probably have a better experience going to korean grill house of all places if you want to grill some meat.

I'm not sure why some of the reviews are so high. Is it because it's an \"authentic\" experience? Seems pretty normal for a korean BBQ restaurant in Toronto. Is it because it's \"traditional\"? Well, they do serve lettuce and side-dishes and you can actually grill your own food, but there's plenty of places like that here. Perhaps the set up of the cheese grill is quite unique, but I would only give them points for presentation in that regard. But they do have other, non BBQ items so maybe those are better?

I do like that they accept credit cards and are willing to split bills."}
{"text":"My husband loves pretty much any food with melted cheese, and so when a friend told us about the spicy chicken and cheese at this place, I knew it wouldn't be long before we tried it out.

We came here on a Wednesday night. The restaurant was probably about 70% full, so we were seated right away. There are two sides to the restaurant, we were told that both sides were the same. I found that the waiters and waitresses were pretty friendly. The only issue throughout the entire night was that when we asked for a glass of cold water, they forgot the first time, and we had to ask again. But it's not really a big deal.

Now onto the food. My husband and I ordered the spicy chicken and cheese, with an add-on of udon. It comes in a very interesting pan, the chicken is in the middle of the pan, and surrounding it is the cheese. The chicken already comes pre-cooked, so we just had to add the udon we ordered and stir it around a bit. We also had to wait for the cheese to melt (which didn't take long), and then we were able to dip the chicken into the cheese. They also served us 6 thin slices of radish, which we were told is used to wrap the chicken with. I loved the combination of the spicy chicken with cheese and the radish. Unfortunately, the 6 pieces were gone pretty fast. 

The main reason I only gave this review three stars is because I thought the dish was a bit too pricey for what it is. Each order of the chicken and cheese is $18, and you have to order a minimum of 2 orders. So basically you have to pay $36 for this dish. If you want to add udon to it, that's another $5. Considering it's just chicken, cheese and udon, I personally found $41 to be pretty overpriced."}
{"text":"My husband and I had decided to try something different for my birthday. Hence, we decided to check this place out. We got the spicy chicken with cheese and it was spicy alright!

The portion was generous, but my husband and I made the mistake of going crazy with the spice level. The spice level had taken away from the taste of the food. You have to be somewhat of a cheese lover to really enjoy this particular dish because its cheese overload! 

Overall, it was a really nice experience and I would definitely go back and try a different dish."}
{"text":"Our go to place for Korean cheesy chicken. Really nice environment and friendly staffs. The food is great value for the price and you get lots of complementary cold dishes. Not sure if there's refill tho. We tried both cheesy chicken and korean BBQs but we all agreed the cheese&chicken is way better."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I only came to revisit because I thought the lack of service was a fluke the first time, but it seems it's quite standard that the service is quite awful here. I had requested a bigger table originally...As I've been here before and I know that the amount of food my guest was gonna order was not going to fit the table we were eating at, unfortunately they said this is the table you get. So we ordered several dishes.

Oden (Fish Cake was OK but all the mussels were dead and it just reeked the whole Oden Broth making it unedible...The waitress kept saying cook it longer but there was an off odor from mussels which indicated they were dead)

Seafood Pancake (this was actually a decent dish however because our table was crowded the waiter asked my sister to hold the HOT PLATE of up food and then he just left....R u serious?)

Chicken with cheese (I've had this before but I forgot that the chicken was raw prior to eating so it would've been nice for them to give my siblings a head up before my little brother consumed raw chicken from this dish)

Table Grill Pork Belly and Beef (The quantity and quality of this meat doesn't justify at all what they gave us, this is more expensive than other Korean BBQ places in the area) 

Steamed egg...Was like deflated wth LOL

Service was pretty atrocious... Nothin was cleared off our table, they got my siblings to hold hot food because they didn't wanna clear out the empty dishes. We rang the buzzer and it works however the wait staff would ignore us. We needed water because the chicken with cheese was a bit too spicy for my siblings. So overall I will probably not recommend or ever come back to this restaurant because clearly the wait staff honestly don't care, as they were quite fast to rush us the bill and collect payment, and even asked us to make sure we tip....(I did leave a tip but honestly this was a completely embarrassing experience)

{"text":"we tried this restaurant because of their spicy chicken with mozarella dipping. we called before hand to book a reservation but the lady said that they don't accept reservation, she said just go there. so we went there, the place was okay. we were disappointed with the food, the sauce is not spicy and it's lacking of that korean spicy and sweet flavour. we didn't enjoy it."}
{"text":"I tried Kobi based on the hype of the Cheese-Ring Chicken and heres what I think of it

Although it was nice to look at the food was not as nice to eat. 

We ordered the spicy chicken and cheese and opted for the extra ramen and rice cakes. We ordered the minimum of two orders between four people. On the side we also ordered the Pork Belly table-cooking. The pork belly was pretty standard no real \"wow\" factor to it, the chicken and cheese was also very too spicy for some people in our table which they didnt warn us as we can usually eat mild to medium foods. Other than it being too spicy there wasn't alot of chicken anyways, the only positive thing about the food was the chicken was very tender and juicy which shows that it is fresh at the very least. 

The service wasn't as quick as some Yelpers stated but it was also pretty busy when I went, not very attentive if theyre not being flagged down as we were trying to see if it was a good idea to turn down the stove as the cheese was frying faster than we could scoop it. 

I would come again not but for the chicken and cheese, if you want good dukgalbi I would go down the street to Joons.

The washroom was standard nothing special no poo on the wall but no gold toilets as well. the quest for the 5-star washroom continues."}
{"text":"We specifically came here because of all the pictures of food dipped in cheese! We came early on a weekday so we didn't have to wait for a table for 2 people. 
Then we ordered the spicy chicken with cheese $18.99 per order and you have to order a minimum of 2 orders. They only have the option of spicy chicken or spicy squid for the cheese dip. 

They bring the whole platter to your table and although the chicken is cooked, the veggies and rice cake is not. Also the cheese starts to melt when they bring it to your table. The waiter comes back and forth to make sure the dish is cooked well at your table. The sauce of the dish is spicy but sweet. It is a good combo of spicy and sweet, similar taste to the bibimbap sauce. I can handle some spice and to me it is a tolerable spice. On a scale of 1-10, it would be an 7. (Water needs to be nearby). 
The dish comes with looooooots of cheese and when you dip the chicken in cheese it makes it less spicy. We also ordered rice because that's what I do as an asian (also makes the dish less spicy). 

It comes with side dishes and the portions are large enough to fill 3 people. It was a good experience since anything is good dipped with cheese!"}
{"text":"Came with another girl friend and order 2 portions of spicy chicken BBQ. And ordered rice at the end to fry on the pan. The portion was alot for 2 ppl, and it tasted good. Side dishes from what I remember was good too."}
{"text":"The server brought forth five plates of banchan first with a complimentary steamed egg dish.  I was so thrilled with this and absolutely thought that the steamed egg was so delicious!  It was plain steamed egg but I enjoyed its fluffiness and smoothness.  

The banchan included kimchi, fermented bok choy, bean sprouts, eggplant, and apple slices & cucumbers.  The eggplant was a unique one that I enjoyed.

Soon, our gigantic wok of spicy chicken and cheese ring arrived to the table!  It was definitely worthy of photos and videos.  Our extra cheese arrived in a 2-cup measuring cup and the rice cakes in a separate dish.  After turning on the heat on the tabletop BBQ, the server poured in the rice cakes and cooked it for us a little bit.  Unlike my experience at Yoogane, the rest of the cooking was left to us that night.

Once the chicken, rice cakes, cabbage, and onions had been thoroughly cooked in the centre grill and the cheese had melted in the ring, we began eating by taking a piece of the chicken and dipping into the cheese ring to eat.  The cheese had probably been left cooking longer than it should have been because we didn't get the gooey and stringy cheese that we wanted but it was still really delicious.  The cheese smelled amazing!

The tender dark meat chicken pieces, when wrapped around the cheese, were a perfect match of tastes and the cheese helped to take away the slight spiciness of the meat and veggies too.  The rice cakes were also firm and tasted just right.

Seafood Pancakes with Garlic Chives:  This looked amazing and came with a dish of soy sauce and floating garlic chives.  I gobbled up a couple slices of the Seafood Pancakes as I waited for the cheese to melt and this Seafood Pancake was absolutely delicious!  There were just enough shrimps and squid in it with green chives and the pancake itself was also thin and not greasy!  It had been a while since I had last had a really delicious and well made Seafood Pancake and I could confidently say that I had found it.  Yay!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The spicy chicken with cheese is delicious. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I came here based on the Yelp reviews here and pictures from Instagram and knew I had to visit. So on Christmas Day, we came here for an early dinner. It wasn't that busy so service was quite efficient. We decided to order the pork belly (the thick cut kind) and the mok sal which I believe is the neck part. Anyway, not only do you get your typical side dishes, but it also comes with a bowl of steamed egg, soybean stew that goes right in the middle of the grill so it's hot the entire time, lettuce leaves, a bowl of green onions and lettuce, a plate of sliced onions, dipping sauce, and a bowl of which I believe is sauce for the meat (and apparently you put your onions in the sauce so it can soak up) - I didn't know this. If you want extra lettuce leaves, rice or steam egg they charge you extra. What I did was ripped the lettuce leaves into small pieces so there would be enough for some of the meat. 

Onto the meat itself, I found the pork neck (?) most juicy, it was really flavourful. I think I prefer it more than the pork belly itself. But don't get me wrong, I love myself some pork belly and those were delicious as well! 

If you're a big eater like me, I don't think two servings will fill you up. It'll just make your stomach content. The service was good, but one of the waitress accidentally dropped my change on the ground and couldn't find it- most likely .10 cents but who cares lol.

Overall, will definitely come back again. I think this place is a bit cheaper than most korean bbq restaurants out there!"}
{"text":"Initially, it was a bit overwhelming with literally everything we ordered coming out all at once. Food filled the table 30 seconds! We ordered the spicy chicken & cheese bbq, marinated pork rib bbq, spicy rice cakes, and seafood pancake. The BBQ came with 2 bowls of rice, a steamed egg dish, soon tofu soup, and lettuce wraps.

Spicy Chicken & Cheese: We were so busy eating and cooking at the same time that we didn't pay much attention to the heat levels.. we kept it at high, so the cheese melted really quickly and soon after began to burn and become crispy. BE SURE TO TURN DOWN THE HEAT! In terms of taste, the chicken was mixed in with onions, peppers and sweet potatoes, and although it still tasted good when combined with the cheese, I thought the spicy sauce masked the cheese flavour too much. This was unique, but I'd actually prefer the dakgalbee from Joon's Restaurant!

Marinated Pork Rib BBQ: The pork was really tender and the marinade tasted a bit sweet and delicious. I know it's a luxury, but I wish they cut up the meat and put it on the grill for us (like they do at Sariwon). They give you a bowl of sweet sauce, which apparently you soak the raw onions in before putting it in the lettuce wrap along with the meat. It tasted really good!

Ddukbokki: The rice cakes were really chewy and cooked to perfection. 

Seafood pancake: Definitely worth trying! If you like chives, you'd love it because it was filled with that. There was also jumbo shrimp on top, along with other seafood toppings.

Overall, I was really satisfied with the food! I'm glad I came with a relatively bigger group (of 6), so I got to try a variety of things. However, I was quite disappointed with the service. When we went into the restaurant, there is nobody to take your name down or attend to you (you just write your name down on a whiteboard that serves as a waiting list). We had made a reservation though, and it took at least 10 minutes for us to wave down and get the chance to speak to a server. We did, luckily, end up getting seated at the time we made the reservation for. Throughout the night though, the servers never checked up on us once, and it was really hard to get their attention.

I would definitely come back to try some of their other food, like the cold noodle platter and one of their hot pots!"}
{"text":"Chicken and Cheese!! We ordered two portions to share between four people and it was still a lot. It does take time to cook so we ordered the thick pork jowl to BBQ for the meantime. Both was so delicious and the price was amazing. My parents loved it and thought it was one of the best Korean BBQ they've had."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to check this place out over the weekend as the hype about it really got my attention. Because really, who would not like some nice looking cheese that goes with the chicken? I definitely won't mind. Cheese lover right here.

But then all is well until we realized that, most of the items on their menu requires a 'minimum 2 orders'. It was a bit confusing and the visuals were misleading. Not to mention PRICEY. I have high expectations from this place but food was meh okay.

We ordered the Spicy Chicken and Spicy Squid with the Cheese. It comes with a nice medium-sized stone bowl of egg soup and the usual appetizers (kimchi, fish cake, sprouts, radish etc) you get from majority of Korean restaurants. Our orders came almost right away and the staff are attentive and quick. 

So here comes the fun part which is CHEESE PULLING. Watching the cheese melt was just awesome. The chicken and rice cakes tasted more sweet than spicy probably because of the sweet potatoes. Which I enjoyed the most. However, we didnt like the combination of the rubbery salty cheese and the spicy chicken and squid. As the cheese gets colder it becomes hard and almost back to its original shredded form. It was disappointing. 

I would say it was pricey and not worth it for the cheese quality you get."}
{"text":"read some yelp review, and was suggested based on the cheese and chicken pan, so went there to try. and boy was i disappointed, we ordered a cheese chicken pan, and also ordered korean bbq, as well as a soup and a seafood pancake. to break down how bad it was we're talking failure on price, taste, quantity, and generally most things. The cheese and chicken was nothing special, the flavor was okay at best but they clearly wanted to make more money so they shoved a bunch of rice cakes inside and onions, and very little actual chicken, they also have a rip off price scheme that says you must order 2 portions minimum, which is ridicoulous in its own way cause from how i see it, that order of 2 portion was 1 pretty much. the only big thing was the pan it cooked in. 

the korean bbq was disappointing at best, the beef was frozen thin slices that was not great or juicy, and the pork belly was extremely tiny. all that for the price they charge was crazy at best, and again they set a 2 minimum order price. they also gave us 2 mushrooms, which was stupid. i'm not sure what they expect us to two with two mushroom with no marinating. 

the seafood pancake was by far the worst, it had barely any seafood, unlike other korean places. it contained a total of 4 shrimps and tiny shrimps. 

the last was the soup the kimichi soup was only thing that was up to some standards, it wasn't great, but wasn't bad either, and the price was fair for it. 

this place is disappointing considering there are so many other korean joints around the area. and also i have no idea who people love this place. cause from how i see it, nothing here is unique and can be easily made at home. 

i only give it 2 stars, because service was okay, and the venue was clean, and the food wasn't outright bad. outside of that i would probably have dropped it to 1"}
{"text":"Amazing grill that has a spot for stew to cook right in the centre. I've had kbbq in korea before and this place is quite comparable (downside is they dont seem to have a vent? So i choked a bit at the smoke when i first stepped in) 

Honestly guys never go back to those ayce places (im looking at u korean grill house) our total bill only came to 38 incl tax for the two of us. We got pork belly and it came with so many interesting side dishes we've never seen before at your standard korean places. And we left feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"Tried the spicy chicken and cheese. The cheese was a little salty. The chicken was good, and really mild in terms of spiciness. We also had the seafood pancake. Lots of green onions. Taste good but prefer if they were thinner. Service was okay. We had to ask about our seafood pancake when we were almost done our spicy chicken."}
{"text":"We came here on weekend as a group of three during Christmas Day. Our goal was to try out the spicy chicken and cheese. When we sat down we realized that the menu required a minimum of 2 orders per table for the Korean bbq or the cheese dishes and both dishes had to be on the same page (I.e you cannot mix kbbq with the chicken/squid and cheese). Something to keep in mind if you are less than 4 people. It was a bit inflexible but we decided to order the squid and chicken and cheese. 

Note: if you order two both come on the same grill. We realized there was a mixup when we ordered and we got two chicken and cheese instead of one squid and one chicken. However the waitress was quick to apologize and provided us with complimentary rice and assured us that the chicken was much better than the squid. Taste wise, it was pretty good. The chicken went well with the cheese as did the rice cake. Cheese on pretty much anything is amazing. Someone came by to turn off the heat but we found that the chicken was still a bit pink so we turned it back on. Overall, it was quick service along with decent food. Aside from a few mishaps, it was an overall positive experience. I'd seek this place out if I was a bigger group and craving cheese!"}
{"text":"Fun place, not all you can eat and price can add up but a fun, nice spot to try if in the area. 

Those with pork dietary restrictions there is beef and a chicken fondue type signature dish.

This place doesnt cheap out on the sides and the meat was tasty, will return if anyone ever wants to try one of these spots uptown."}
{"text":"The pork belly at this place is a must and beef is 2nd to the pork belly. The cold buckwheat noodles are good too but the 2nd time I had it wasn't so great.

Service is good and the servers understand English. Side dishes are yummy and the wait isn't too long. It is also quite kid friendly if you get a little booth !"}
{"text":"The food quality is amazing, the service is fast, the atmosphere is authentic. I would recommend getting Thinly Sliced Beef and Thick Cut Pork Belly if you are going for BBQ. Only downside is that it is expensive, but it is justified by the food quality and experience."}
{"text":"The place is a typical Korean BBQ restaurant. But what makes it special is their BBQ served with soup and a steamed egg. A lot of side dishes and you can refill them many times as you wish so as the lettuce. The service is really good, usually they come right away if you need help. And the staff are really friendly and they will explain to you if you are confused  about the menu. It's a really great place to hang out with friends!!"}
{"text":"My first time here. Came with a group of 11. That probably wasn't the best idea. We were given our own section, and it had two tables that could comfortably seat four. We were fairly squished. At any other restaurant, sitting with chairs so close that we couldn't get up unless the people next to us moved would already be an issue. Here, it was worse. 

The problems started about as soon as we sat down. They gave us bowls to eat out of, and the entire stack was oily. Not just a little oily. I could see the oil on my fingers. We asked for clean bowls. They server looked unhappy with our request. They gave us more bowls. The majority of these ones had some sort of dried food stains on them, so we once again asked for more. Pretty sure the third time, they were still slightly oily, but we gave up asking again. During this, they also didn't give us enough tea or cold water for our cups, or enough sets of cutlery even though we asked a couple of times. Short staffed? Probably an issue here. On the upside, they do answer when you press the buzzer on the wall.

Things went crazy after the food started coming. The issue with sitting all crammed at a restaurant like this is that if the tables aren't big enough, there isn't enough space to put the food. I ordered 6 portions of BBQ meats (beef : $24.99/order, thick pork belly: $16.99/order and thin pork belly: $15.99/order), 2 orders of spicy chicken and cheese (minimum 2 portions), a Kobi nabe set (fish cake, udon, hard boiled eggs, mussels, dumplings), and a 2 person portion of cold noodles. Each of the BBQ items said a minimum of 2 orders, so that I did. There was not nearly enough space on the two tables for all the food, and the servers did next to nothing (other than separate our cold noodles into portions for us) to alleviate the problem. With the side dishes, the lettuce (served in measuring cups), the sauces, etc., my aunt was literally holding onto the raw meat plate as she began to grill so that we would have space on the table. The grilled meats come with a bowl of rice. The spicy chicken does not. None of the rice came until I ordered it at the end of the meal. Not cool. I mean, we're pretty much done our meat before we have to ask for rice? I did get an extra bowl of rice as \"service\". Did that make up for the previous issues? Not in the least. I suppose they didn't give us rice because there was no space on the table for it, but that's not my problem. If I'm with a party of two and you sit me at a two person table and I don't have enough space because I ordered a lot of food, fine. I accept that it's my fault. This, however, was slightly ridiculous. We ended up putting things on the table dividers and stuff. It made for a fairly tasking dining experience.

That being said, they get 3 stars because their food is quite tasty, and the portions are very reasonable for the price. They also gave us steamed egg as a free appetizer, and that was a nice touch. The spicy chicken was not very spicy, but definitely delicious, especially with the cheese (mozz, I think). We also thought there wasn't enough cheese. It looks like a lot, but when you dip the chicken in, it disappears really quickly. Still not worth the price though, at $18.99/serving, seeing as it isn't even served with rice. Here I thought Joon's was expensive. This tasted much better than Joon's though.  In terms of grilled meat, the thin pork belly was too thin (think super-thin bacon). It cooked wayyy too quickly and lacked any sort of substance. Think shaved deli meat/hotpot meat. Shouldn't be a grilled option. The thick pork belly and the beef were both delicious and super tender though. While the beef was well marinated and had good marbling, the thick pork belly was my favorite because it was just that incredibly juicy. With the lettuce wraps and that lovely vinegary sauce they provided (the one that looks like soy sauce), it doesn't even feel fatty.

Perhaps I would be back on a weekday with a considerably smaller party, but I would have to get over the dirty dishes first."}
{"text":"Me and my friend went to Kobi tonight and the food and service was actually amazing. I was not expecting a good service based on the previous reviews I had read here, but the servers were all friendly and amazing. The lady serving us did all her best to tell us about the dishes and she was very quick brining our side dishes and main. She also came back 3-4 times to make sure everything is okay and asked how we like the food. We ordered beef and pork. For me the beef was better and next time I'll probably order two servings of beef instead of beef + pork. Overall I was very happy with the food and service and the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was referred by a colleague to come by here to try it out from the rave reviews.

I was craving food dipped in cheese, so we decided this was the spot! 

The waiter we had was very friendly, he helped re-fill our tea and side dishes when they were empty.

However, I do agree with the other reviewers below it is a bit pricey if you decide to opt for the infamous  chicken/squid and cheese dish. Reason being is because on the menu, it is kind of confusing (it says minimum 2 orders, but doesn't really specify if you can do different meat combinations with the cheese or what it REALLY means) but ends up you will actually need to order 2 of the $18.99 dish. 

Anyway, we ordered two chicken and cheese which comes in this gigantic stone bowl and it goes over the bbq stovetop. When our order came, it was incorrect (squid, chicken and cheese) but it was too late because we didn't realize until after-the-fact because the sauce covered it and both me and the boyfriend were starving after work. 

I am a bit allergic to shellfish, so that wasn't very appealing when we found out. The pieces of chicken to squid was around 1:3. 

Regardless, the service was great, the experience was fun and interesting. I would come back with friends!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Korean barbecue restaurant. I would say it's cleaner than an average Korean restaurant that I have been in the past. Their famous dish is the barbecue chicken with cheese on the side. Taste pretty good but not super unique/ special- hence the 4 star!"}
{"text":"WOAH! This place is amazeballs. Y'all know I don't even use that word gently. It looked nice from the outside and having only seen one yelp review for this, I decided to go for it. 

The server was extremely friendly, courteous and efficient. We were seated immediately at an extremely large table for 2, and we soon decided we wanted to try the korean barbeque because it looked so good in the pictures we've seen and from the table across from us. As always, we crave samgyupsal during a kbbq so we decided on the thinly sliced pork belly and the pork belly unsliced. It all came to about $35 with tax, which is not too shabby for a 2 person kbbq. So many things arrived to our table that it was amazing just to see.. side dishes, lettuce, meat sauce x 2, dipping sauce x2, soybean kimchi soup (in the middle of the hot plate, being boiled from the fire), egg soup, plate of spicy salad, plate of onions.. man, there were so many ingredients! Now I understand why each table is so large. 

The pork belly cooked beautifully and the meat they used is extremely high quality. I liked the thinly sliced ones, because they cook so fast and they're so delicious. Also, since I can't eat alot, the thin ones are perfect for me so I don't feel like bursting after. The thick ones are also really good. They're HUGE... very delicious though. The grills are also extremely clean, which is impressive. 

After my lunch, I wasn't hungry for the next 12 hours.. I don't recommend eating this at night because you'll definitely be in a food coma. I'm definitely coming back though!"}
{"text":"Went to try a popular KBBQ place in Vaughan. It is highly recommended by many foodies alike so I decided to go and give it a try. The staff are okay but the service isn't that great to be honest. Their food is awesome though. Our table ordered the marinated beef dish and their signature dish of the Spicy Squid Pot with Cheese, You have to have a minimum order of 2 for this deal. The food did take quite a bit of time to come but when it came, it smelled so delicious. Basically, you use the squid meat and wrap it with cheese on the outside and it just melts in your mouth. It was quite good and the spicy level was tolerable for those who don't like too much spice. The marinated beef dish is cooked on the grill and then it is wrapped with lettuce and you place different herbs and onions on it. This also worked well and was quite delicious. Overall, it was quite a delicious memorable meal. Would definitely recommend to other people looking to try a different and unique experience dining with Korean food."}
{"text":"The outside of this restaurant says Kobi in big letters with the words chicken and cheese right below it. You're going to get the dak galbi right? I mean they're literally advertising it! A quick glance at the pictures here shows that the dak galbi here is the defacto dish of this place. So what's the verdict?

The food is definitely good here but whether or not it is worth it is another story. 

My favorite dish was actually the platter naeng myeon. It comes deconstructed on a platter, with the veggies in little mounds, the waiter cuts the noodles, adds the vinegar and mustard, and uses the glove to mix all that goodness up! So it's technically a bibim naeng myeon without the broth. There's that awesome gochujang based hot sauce that brings it all together with the mild spicyness and sweetness. It's a bit more modern in terms of the vegetables they use but it's still excellent. It's just perfect in terms of textures and flavors. You can't dislike it. 

Okay now for the ever popular dak galbi. It's looks big! Then you look closely then you wonder 'no, there's no that much in there' but it is quite filling actually. We ordered it for two people and while there's plenty of chicken there, there's also a large amount of veggies (I'm looking at you onions and cabbage). Not that I am complaining. I love my crispy onions and veggies with my meals but just a FYI. The cheese ring on the outside was a bit disappointing. I did like the corn and pineapple in there but once the heat was turned off and the cheese started cooling it just became like stiff cheese that you ate separately. Can't really dip it. Even though we didn't try it, I'd be more than willing to recommend to throw some of the cheese into the main pot to emulsify all that goodness. 

And another pleasant thing! They have poggi kimchi here. I just appreciate the small details. 

Service was a lot slower than I would have liked; the dak galbi coming some forty minutes after the naeng myeon, and that's after I gave up, rang the bell, and asked the lady where our dish went."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.

The specials on the menu were quite confusing. Staff were a bit inattentive. Food was okay but it wasn't amazing - I found the dishes to be super spicy despite telling the server to make our dishes less spicy. Not sure if it was the side of the restaurant where we were in but I found the ambiance to be a bit depressing - the dim lighting, greyish walls (with mysterious stains on them) took away from my experience at the restaurant. Also, the dishes and utensils were dirty. I'll probably not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"There's good reason why kobi is always packed. The first time I tried this place was for the cheesy spicy chicken that looks so epic in photos but tasted just okay in real life. The kbbq is really what's worth coming back for.

The pork belly is definitely the highlight here - thick, juicy cuts of pork belly meat that grills so perfectly on the table stove and goes so well with all the accompanying sides. Wrapping the meat in the lettuce leaves along with an endless flow of Kimchi, fresh slaw, pickled onion, garlic, different dipping sauces and some rice is so delicious and satisfying.

So save your money on the gimmicky cheesy chicken where the cheese doesn't melts properly and focus on the bbq! Also I recommend trying the grape soju that actually has little grape pieces in it.. the perfect partner for the meal. For $30 per person, we feasted deliciously and I am getting so hungry writing this review.. can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. Different kind of Korean BBQ food and way better then the all you can eat BBQ places. A must try place! Ordered spicy chicken and cheese, marinated pork ribs and pork belly. Can't wait to go back!! 
One negative feedback is how there was no air circulation anywhere in the entire restaurant and it was extremely hot. I would have definitely enjoyed the food a lot more if it was air conditioned and had air circulating the entire restaurant because I was just sweating while sitting there. Even waiting for a table I was sweating and trying to tan myself with their menu."}
{"text":"I don't know if they were having an off day. But the servers were rude as f. First of all, I've never had the spicy chicken before and we were only two people so we asked how it worked. They said we could only order two portions. The person I was with wanted to make sure- for some unknown reason- so she asked another waiter. He explained that we had to order two portions because it would look empty otherwise.

Ok, cool. I understand that they might get this question all the time from newbies and it might get annoying. But that's life and their job to help the clientele figure out the menu.

Here is where it gets weird. The waitress, who admittedly was nice at the start, drops off our tea and tells us we can press the buzzer if we needed anyone. No one ever heeded our buzzer. The guy with the glasses came by and refilled our tea and oddly, after dropping off the kettle, brush his hands together, like \"I wash my hands of you guys\" kind of motion.

No matter, maybe we misinterpreted ( highly doubtful though). The waitress drops off our spicy chicken and cheese dish. Disappears.

We don't see anyone for the next while. I was jokingly saying I should google how it works because I had no idea how to cook it. No one came by and checked on us, explain, or offered to cook it for us. When another table ordered the dish, I saw that they helped cook the food.

I was frankly amazed but thought maybe, they thought we handled the cooking and knew what we doing.


We then tried to get our bill because we were feeling oddly unwelcomed- for asking a question about the dishes perhaps????- the guy goes ok. 

Vanishes. We see him drop off another bill at another table. At this point, my friend is getting upset and keeps on repeatedly gesturing at the waiters and waitresses passing by. No one stops. We pressed the button, no one came.

The drink station was right by our table. So out of desperation she starts gesturing and asking \"can we get our bill\"? EVERYONE IGNORES HER for a good five minutes. At this point, she raises her voice slightly and asks for her bill.

Finally, the waitress looks up. Now maybe she could have handled the situation better, and just quietly sat there for the 20 minutes while someone got her bill but she didn't. 

We felt truly unwelcome from the beginning to end. I don't know if it was a race thing but this is Canada, a land of different communities and colours. What a bunch of passive aggressive RACIST BULLSHIT."}
{"text":"Actual review 4.5 
We were really hungry when we came in, and the amazing smell of food made me want to stay even more :3
The food was great we got the spicy chicken and cheese. 
It looked super awesome (they added pineapple and corn pieces into the cheese, which i liked) 
the food tasted pretty good too, the chicken was pretty average however together with the cheese it made a really nice and flavorful combination. 
The service was really quick and helpful. 
and the bathrooms were nice!
The reason for the 4.5 is that the table is small and the pot is large, so even if you're just eating out of your plate you could get burned on it (i hit it with my finger like 3 times). 
And it's on the pricier side since you have to order it as 2 portions, but it was still able to fill both of us up. 

i would def recommend this place to my friends, it was great"}
{"text":"Ordered the spicy chicken and shrimp with cheese. Overall a decent experience

Pros: cool experience, great customer service, anything covered in cheese is delicious, more than enough for 2 people

Cons: had not one bit of spice in it, no flavours kind of tasted like everything was thrown in tomato sauce, pineapples in cheese ( no mention of that in the menu), minimum order of 2 orders 

Would come back to try something else on their menu but not for the chicken and cheese dish"}
{"text":"Newly renovated from 'Jang Gang', is now the new Kobi kbbq! It's spacious with individual ventilation for each table which makes the experience much enjoyable. We ordered the bulzip samgyupsal (thick-cut cross hatched pork belly) and dakgalbi (spicy chicken stir-fry), tastes super authentic and it comes with many side dishes that's essential in making ssam (lettuce wraps) and refreshing your palette for each bite. The server was super kind and helpful and gave us pajeon (green onion pancake) and egg soufflé for free for ordering so much! We were about to burst open with so much food.
One down side was the quality of the cheese for the dakgalbi. It wasn't string-y but rather hard.. probably not real cheese which are chemically made with plant-based oils and such.. which is fine but I personally wouldn't eat it again. But please do order the bulzip samgyupsal! It's sooo good!"}
{"text":"I don't know why the score of this place is so high. The portion of food was extremely small. We ordered a $25 bbq beef but only three pieces of beef came. Another dishes were also very small. Nobody(4 people) was full when we finished. Btw, we ordered four portions food. I will never come here again."}
{"text":"We ordered two portions of pork belly & beef for our table top bbq. The cuts were tender & marinated well. The banchans were also tasty, and can be refilled limitlessly. I only wish that they had vents over the grill so that the smell doesn't stick to my clothes."}
{"text":"Came here for the hype, and was satisfied. The spicy chicken and cheese is pretty filling fillig, so don't order anything else (other than rice if you want). You can only order this dish with a minimum of two portions (2 or more people) each portion is almost $20, so each person will be paying $20. I don't find this dish to be super amazing but anything with melted cheese is awesome to me! The servers will cook everything for you, so don't worry about mixing the chicken. The dish was more spicy than expected but nonetheless still delicious.

Be sure to come early (6ish ) because this place gets crowded fast, even on a weekday."}
{"text":"Who could say \"no\" to spicy meat dipped in cheese?! You have absolutely got to order the cheese ring with spicy meat and make sure you eat it while it is HOOOTTT!! 

I was so enamoured by the reviews and pictures that I saw of Kobi Korean BBQ that I had to come here and experience the food myself. 

First off, I'd recommend coming in a group, preferably four people. The restaurant requires you to place two order of meat for the cheese ring as well as for the BBQ. 

We ordered the squid and chicken cheese ring, which also came with rice cakes, carrots, and onions. Make sure you eat the meat with cheese while it's hot because towards the end of the meal, the cheese got hard it wasn't fun dipping in it. We had some leftovers at the end of the meal and I took the rest of it home because all you need is just some leftover rice, an egg, and BAM, you're on your way to making some delicious fried rice the next day.

For the BBQ meat, because they're undergoing some renovation when i went, they had to cook the meat in the kitchen and then bring it to our table. As it was served over a warmer, the beef became a tough from being slightly overcooked. I may suggest that the beef be cooked slightly under so while it is under the warmer that it doesn't become overcooked.

I love the side-dishes that we got; the portion is a lot smaller but you could ask for multiple refills--this also goes for the lettuce too!!  

I was surprised that our dishes came with steam egg and soon tofu jigae. I absolutely loved the steam egg, it was very simple but tasty. The soon tofu jigae was great but to share communally was slightly awkward. 

We were served cold water but I would have loved it if the restaurant served hot barley tea, but then again, that is my personal preference.

Service-wise, it was alright. We were waving our hands to catch the servers attention and then we found that there's a bell on the wall that we could ring. The servers were kind to get what we needed so I am not complaining. 

Overall, I love this place and definitely plan to come back in the future."}
{"text":"First time coming to a traditional Korean bbq restaurant! Kobi is one of the few, if only Korean restaurant in the city that serves their Korean spicy chicken or seafood platter in cast iron with melted cheese. Aside from that they serve a lot of traditional dishes with their extensive menu selection.
Though the place isn't the fanciest it is quite popular in terms of selection.

Drinks: we both shared their fruit infused sake which was a great starter!

for Food It was obvious for me to try their Spicy Squid with cheese.  Served on a huge cast-iron platter this dish needs a few minutes to warm up over the table top stove to give the cheese enough time to melt and use as a dip for the seafood.  The portions were enough and overall was an awesome dish I'd definitely try again, perhaps the chicken would be next on my list. 
Service was excellent and very attentive to our needs, excellent!

Overall Kobi is a great spot for Korean food! See you soon!"}
{"text":"A++++. I got two grills of pork belly and spicy chicken and cheese and they were off the hook. THERE IS A RING OF MELTED CHEESE TO DIP YOUR MEAT IN. This needs to become standard for every single restaurant. It was delicious and a perfect accessory to the meat. Their side dishes were also yummy. And the dipping sauce was mmmmm. Literally everything was amazing. And I am pretty picky. So run and try this restaurant because I haven't been this impressed in awhile! (they also have grapefruit soju!)"}
{"text":"I found the male serving us to be rude, lacking in knowledge and presumptive. I was very greatful he decided to randomly switch and give us another server, she was wonderful and didn't drip of his disgusting entitled, prejudiced aura. She was quite lovely and served us with good humor and a smile. 
The food was delicious, but we received as I can tell from looking at the photos of others served in this establishment the very bare basics, no rice, no lettuce etc... 
I honestly felt discriminated against in a passive aggressive manner, the male server had the audacity to remind me I was ordering pork... as if every brown person was unable to eat that meat, but didn't bring this up with my Caucasian friends ordering pork belly, I was not impressed. I believe some decorum and manners are needed for that gentleman as well as a reminder Canada is diverse and I probably speak more Korean than you...lol
The food however I cannot fault, the meat though expensive was delicious and flavourful. The Dukbokki was spicy and honestly made me very happy. Our lovely female server was knowledgeable and pleasant. In the end it was a wonderful experience with both service and food quality. I am greatful the server was changed at the beginning of the experience. 

In all it's worth checking out. But I think I will not be returning as I feel the prejudice behavior of the male, the missing items from our order,  the exclusively Korean menu etc says... you aren't welcome here."}
{"text":"Food: 4.5/5
Service: 5/5
Atmosphere: 4.5/5 

This place is always busy so be prepared for a wait during weekend peak hours. 

This is my second time here. This time, we ordered the oden set which is like korean hot pot. The broth is simple yet sweet and flavourful towards the end. It came with a lot of fish cakes and 4 eggs, meant to be shared amongst a family. We also got the beef and cabbage stew. On the first sip, the soup tasted very home-y and had authentic Korean flavours. (Tip: eat the oden ingredients with a Korean stew to get a nice kick of flavours). We also got the seafood (had shrimp, octopus) and leek pancake. The ingredients were fresh and pan-fried well. Some parts could use a tad less dough. But I am craving it again already!

I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch with my friends. The food was ok, nothing special.
However, the service was really bad. I don't know how to describe it, but the waitress acted like we owe her lots of money... She was unresponsive to our questions-- like, no joke, she rolled her eyes on us until we ask the next question. 
We had a pot of tea with us. She took it away and said we are not allowed to keep the tea pot on our table. Just ask her when we need to drink tea-- she comes by every half an hour though......

The funny thing was, when we almost done lunch, she suddenly became so friendly and started asking how we were doing-- still wouldn't bring napkins or tea or new chopsticks to us when we requested tho, but she actually looked at us in the eyes...

So yea, customer service was really bad, but we had fun watching her being mad at a bunch of customers tho :)"}
{"text":"Despite the high price tag, I think Kobi is by far the best Korean BBQ restaurant I've been to yet.

 This is not AYCE, so you have to order each platter of meat separately and share it amongst your company. I was a little turned-off by this idea due to the small quantities that appeared in photos posted by other Yelpers, but I found that the most filling platters were the ones that sounded the least plentiful (when eaten with the sides provided). Specifically, their pork belly platter was extremely filling compared to the thinly sliced beef.

 The sides provided (onion, romaine leaves and spicy greens) were complimentary with the meat platters. My group wanted to order the spicy chicken and cheese, but we were told that we needed to order two plates of it, for unknown reasons. This disappointed us, but our meal experience overall was pretty great despite this letdown.

 The service at this restaurant was very accommodating and excellent. Often times, my group of friends feel like a burden asking for additional side dishes and water, however we felt comfortable doing so at Kobi.

 Great dishes, a little overpriced and questionable as to why two plates of spicy chicken are required to be ordered."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken and cheese dish for two. Although super cheesy for someone who hasn't eaten much cheese as of late. But delicious nonetheless. And the seafood pancake was also really good but on the oily side. Picked this over the dumplings."}
{"text":"Came on a weekday for lunch. Seated right away. Service was Standard. Ordered the spicy fried chicken w cheese (min. 2 orders) . To be honest.. It remind of Joon's... Except there's no ramen mixed in. There's too much cheese.. And it hardens and becomes rubbery too quickly as everything else in the middle is cooking. They need to add the cheese at the end.. Or have it on the side to make it more enjoyable. Would have to come back and try other dishes and Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"Among the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. 

We came in and the manager said we would be seated shortly. Thirty minutes later a bunch of other guests were seated that came in after us and we were just left standing there like idiots (with OPEN tables that just needed to be cleared). Manager makes excuses and didn't apologize and said \"I'm trying to clean up the table but people keep asking for things\". If I'm not mistaken, I asked for a table thirty minutes ago.. why isn't my request being heeded first? This was ridiculously infuriating and I hope they get their act together."}
{"text":"Kobi is my go-to Korean BBQ restaurant in Toronto! I personally think they have the best bbq from all the other Korean restaurants I've been to and their service is great.

Their pork belly comes in thick cuts with a good amount of fat which makes it extremely juicy and tender. I love how they serve their doenjang jjigae (soybean paste stew) in the middle of the grill because it is constantly boiling, making the broth richer and more flavourful. Unlike other Korean bbq restaurants, Kobi offers more doenjang jjigae when you're running low. They also offer a variety of tasty side dishes to eat with your meal.

Not only is their pork belly delicious, their pork rib kimchi stew is amazing and definitely a must-have! I would recommend their hot pot portion because it is served and cooked on a portable gas stove which keeps it hot. The stew is extremely rich with deep flavours of the kimchi, and the pork ribs in the stew are big and tender.

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Service was awful. When booking reservation they didn't tell me the bbq was unavailable. Kind of the point of going there. They said fully booked so couldn't give us the time we wanted, so came earlier, yet there were multiple empty tables when we were eating. Also the tea was not hot."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place, and finally had the chance to visit yesterday. We ordered the spicy chicken with cheese BBQ and it was delicious! I love that they also added some corn and pineapples in the cheese. Those are my favorite! Service was also attentive as someone would come as in a while to help us stir the chicken. Price wise is reasonable so I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the beef rib, pork belly, and spicy chicken (think there was rice cakes in there too?) dish that came with the melted cheese and corn on the outskirts of the wok. This was very delicious given its uniqueness and the environment.

They give you a wooden spoon to start stirring and cooking it off the tabletop stove, and the process of watching the cheese melt. Afterwards when everything is warmed and cooked up, you start picking up the meat pieces and combine it with the melted cheese together = delicious.

You could also add rice with that which they will top a bowl of steamed rice afterwards and put it inside the kimchi mix of the wok, seaweed shreds to make it kimchi 'fried' rice. Overall, experience was very good and this place was also very full. We went when it was about 10pm so they were in the process of cleaning up and doing their last orders.

Would come again to try."}
{"text":"To me this restaurant is more of a \"only try once for the experience\" type of restaurant, or in other words: a gimmick. 

Me and a couple friends plan on going to the restaurant because the photos look really good, and we made reservations couple days ahead. Turns out we definitely needed the reservation, because at 7pm on the Friday that we went, the area was packed and there were already quite a few of people waiting seats at the door. From the other reviews on Yelp it seems that the waiting process was really frustrating, so I was glad that we got reservations and I would definitely recommend those interested in trying out the restaurant to do the same.  

Environment:
The restaurant is located not too far from the Yonge/Steeles major intersection, though it's more on the west side of it, so I would recommend you to take the 60 Steeles West bus if you're travelling by TTC. There are ample of free parking space for those who drive as well.
The layout of the inside of the restaurant is a little weird, it's like the restaurant has 2 spaces that are sectioned off from one another, and the corridor to get to the other end was basically the entrance where you have a ton of people lining up for a table. 
The booth that we got for out table of 6 was pretty nice that it was essentially a small room (see photo). It's meant to sit 8 people in total, but I think it will be really cramped. There were no tables larger than that for bigger groups, so make sure to limit the size of your group or be prepared to be split into 2 tables. 
Overall, due to it being a Korean BBQ restaurant, the BBQ smell essentially lingers throughout the restaurant, and the dining surface did feel rather greasy. As a result, make sure not to wear something that you would not like getting dirty in.  

Food:
Between the 6 of us we ordered 2 dishes: Korean Spicy Chicken with Cheese, and a Korean BBQ with marinated beef and pork ribs. Keep in mind that for the BBQ and Cheese dishes you must order at least 2 portions. 
The table we were sitting at only had 1 stove top built-in, but since we ordered 2 hot plate dishes they will simply brought over a portable stove top. 
We received 2 sets of complementary side dishes, which included kimchi, bean sprouts, eggplants, white radishes, and tofu slices. We also got some other sides such as lettuces, green onion salad, onion slices, ginger, and garlic to accompany our hot plates. 
Korean Spicy Chicken with Cheese: the concept was definitely unique as I have never eaten anything like that before. The flavour of the chicken was pretty good and the \"regular\" spiciness that we chose was actually rather spicy. The cheese on the edge was basically mozzarella cheese. Make sure you don't overheat the cast-iron plate, because when the cheese becomes overcooked it basically forms into crumbs and you won't get the stretchy effect. For $40 for 2 portion sizes, this dish is rather expensive for the amount of food you're getting, and I feel like potentially you can recreate it at home. 
Korean BBQ: SO NOT WORTH IT!!! We ordered marinated beef short rib ($25) and marinated pork short rib ($20), and in total we probably only got 1lb of meats. I don't know how authentic it is in terms of flavour and meat quality, but just for the price of it I would definitely not recommend ordering it. The size of the slices of meat was huge, such that we basically had to cut the meat slice with a pair of scissors so everyone gets to try a piece. 

Service:
There was a button on the table that we could press to call for service, which had someone responding to it probably 50% of the times, and even then the servers were very impatient and had a negative attitude overall.  
No one really came to check up on us periodically, so we had to call them whenever we needed them to refill the water/tea. Trust me, you will drink a lot of water due to eating spicy food containing MSG."}
{"text":"Food was good, prices were okay. You have to order two orders of the spicy chicken and cheese, with each order at $18.99. I'm not sure it's meant to only be for 2 people, we ordered two orders for 4 people, and added steamed rice and it was enough food. But, I suppose that would depend how hungry you are. There are spicy level options when you order, we ordered regular (which I assumed would be regular spicy), but it was not that spicy. The flavour was still good, but would have preferred more of a kick. There was also cabbage, potato, and rice cakes in the chicken mix. There was pineapple in the cheese on the side. We mixed the cheese right in with the chicken as well as the steamed rice. Would go back if I was in the area, but would not come specifically here for the spicy chicken and cheese. Service was okay, but they were quite busy on a Wednesday evening, which made it hard to even get water refills."}
{"text":"Kobi is the absolute best in korean bbq. My friends and I travel all the way from downtown often to go to Kobi. Definitely very busy during peak hours, you will wait for a table. Great service, even better food and at a fairly decent price. This is my favourite restaurant in all of Toronto."}
{"text":"- Spicy chicken and cheese: it was flavourful and spicy chicken with hot cheese around. I thought this dish was good, but I have tried better one. It looks like they gave a lot of cheese but it actually runs out very quick so you need to order extra cheese. This combo came with steamed egg soup which was nice but lack of flavour. Side dishes at Kobi were pretty good as well. 
- Portion: enough for 2 people, if you're a heavy eater you may need to order another dish 
- Price: The price showing on menu was only one portion and you need to order at least 2 portions so it was about almost $40, which was average for Korean bbq 
- Place was big but quickly filled up
- Tip: When you come in, don't be shy to write ur name on the white board, otherwise no one knows that you're lining up (the host and servers there were very busy)"}
{"text":"4/5:

Made reservations for this place on Friday for late night Korean BBQ and Soju (No cheese chicken unfortunately). We had a group of 8 people which allowed us to sit in one of the private tables which was really comfortable. All in all the restaurant had a simple KBBQ vibe, with good food, good service, which helped make it a good night. 

For food, we (for 4; we split the table 4 people per grill) ordered 4 servings of the Samgyupsal (which came with all the side dishes including soybean paste soup, and steamed egg), along with 4 orders of rice, and a light order of Soju (3 bottles) to pair with the pork. As \"service\" (which is the Korean term for free food; they tend to give out free food if you come in a big group or order alot of food) we got some Ddeok-Bokki (Spicy Rice Cakes) which was great. The price of food here is pretty standard for KBBQ; the bill for our side came out to roughly $40 per person (incl. tip), so it's definitely not cheap. We split the food order into two which really made paying the bill more convenient.

Recommendations: definitely make reservations they were packed when we got there, and remained packed til we left. Also, if you're not driving, I suggest eating Korean BBQ the traditional way: with Soju. If you don't like Soju, I recommend trying the flavored ones (Grapefruit) or even some Makgulli (Korean rice wine). For any first timers, don't wear anything nice as it will smell like delicious pork until the day you wash it. Also don't be afraid to ring the bell and ask for more side dishes, take advantage of the fact that you can get unlimited kimchi (in theory). Also, this is a very social meal so loosen up, take lots of shots, and eat your heart out. Enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is located right off on the north side of steeles. There is a service Ontario, and the plaza has shops lined around in a large square. I totally missed this plaza and went into an adjacent one, but luckily if you drive around all the plazas are connected either in the front or back.

Once your in the plaza you can't miss this place.

Upon entering we were instantly greeted and seated. This was on a Friday at 6:30.

We ordered the spicy chicken and cheese for 2 ($18.99 per portion).

The meal came with 6 sides, steamed egg, spicy chicken surronded by a ring of cheese. It's very reminiscent of da kal bi to me, but it could be a totally different, bottom line though regardless of what it's called it's awesomely tasty. The ring of cheese gets nice and crispy at the end.

The place isn't the most well decorated, sort of a darker and dingier place, but that's only due to all the customers and constant BBQing. When you walk in, you can tell this is a real Korean bbq place.

As usual while waiting for the star of the meal we eat most of the sides, and were pleasantly surprised when they quickly asked to refill them. Usually we need to hunt them down.

At the end of the meal we also got the fried rice, it was honestly a whole ton of food and we ended up taking the rest home.

As we were leaving we also saw people bbqing out on their patio, which is perfect on a nice cool summer evening.

Friendly, quick and efficient service. Tasty food. Great cheerful festive atmosphere. 

Price is right on point as well, you get quite a bit for your dollar here.

If your expecting a huge deal, or white glove service this place isn't quite it. But if you want some good authentic korean bbq  with no frills, this is the place.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here as i was craving for Korean bbq on a random Friday. The two of us ordered two orders of the beef ribs combo(24.99/ order). The combo comes with bowl of tofu soup, steamed egg soup, lettuce wraps, spicy lettuce and a variety of side dishes.  Not bad for the price considering you can always ask for refills.  The beef ribs were marinated well, just perfect for me. The meat were good quality, they didnt get dry and chewy even when some of the meat was left on the stove for too long. 

We also ordered a Seolleong tang (korean broth made with ox bones, briskets and other cuts). The soup was rather bland which was disappointing. It tasted like water with thin strips of brisket and noodles in it.  The rice that came with the soup was dry and hard. 

The service was OK. Most of the servers are friendly and helpful.  Some of the servers are not great in English so some of our requests were ignored or misunderstood.  

Overall, i would come back again to try their seafood platter hotpot and pork belly. However, I would never order any of their soup items from the menu again."}
{"text":"We visited Kobi on a Friday night around 7 pm. When we went inside, the place was sooo packed! There were people everywhere. There were servers walking back and forth and customers were all jammed in the front entrance. It took some time before we tracked down the host. The host told us it will be a 15 mins wait. We notified the host we were fine with the wait and we waited at the waiting area. As time prolonged, we were a little skeptical because we weren't sure if the host remembered us. He didn't give us a number or got our name. We were waiting over 30 mins and we weren't sure about our status of our table. I finally asked the host about our status and he informed us we will be next. 

We finally got seated and sat on a 4 seating table even though there were only two of us. The menus were presented to us quickly. We wanted to try their spicy chicken with cheese and seafood pancake! When we placed the order, the waitress informed us we don't have to order just chicken (minimum order is 2). We can mix it up like squid and chicken on the same platter.  We decided to give that a try. The meal doesn't include rice. So, we decided to order additional rice on the side. The waitress said she will stir fry the rice with the leftover meat after we finished with our meal. 

After our order was placed, the waitress quickly placed our 5 side dishes on the table. We were super hungry and we devour them in no time. Our seafood pancake came next and it tasted delicious! It had lots of seafood and onions! The meal also came with steamed egg and it was very soft and fluffy :) 

The waitress finally served our spicy chicken and squid hot plate and she left without saying anything. We weren't sure what to do with it. We just patiently waited for the cheese to melt. We assume the meats were already cooked before placing on the platter. After 5 minutes or so, we can see the cheese already melted, so we thought it was okay to eat. As my boyfriend was eating his first piece of chicken, he quickly splat out a large chunk of pink and slimy chicken. \"It is RAW!!!\" It was literally like chicken sashimi. I was surprised and afraid because I literally inhaled a big piece of chicken just now.

We decided to wave down and question the waiter because we weren't sure if the chicken was at least semi-cooked before placing on the hot plate. We even show the waiter the piece of raw chicken on the tissue paper. The waiter looked very confused and said he will come back. When he came back, he said we ordered chicken not beef. He didn't answer our question at all. There was definitely a huge language barrier at this restaurant. We should've learned some Korean before stepping in this restaurant. =.=\"

The food itself tasted pretty decent. We really enjoyed our spicy chicken and squid hot plate especially the sauce. We ordered mild spicy for our order and the spice level was manageable. Other than that one piece of raw chicken, the rest of the cooked chicken slices were very tender and goes well with the cheese and sauce. There were other vegetables included in the hot platter like potatoes and onions! The potatoes were thinly sliced and soaked up the sauce like a sponge :9 ! The cheese was very interesting, there were pieces of corn in the cheese. They were very generous with their food portion! We had to pack some food home and we didn't end up ordering the side order of rice. The amount of food we packed home is good enough for another person to eat. 

Tip: Make sure you come hungry to this restaurant because you will not leave hungry. :) 

However, we weren't too fond with the service at this restaurant. If you want any assistance during your meal like refilling your water, you will definitely need to wave the waiter/waitress down like a crazy maniac xP. However, they will eventually help you, just be patient. 

I will definitely consider coming back after I improve/learn my Korean. Maybe there will be better service and communication if I spoke in Korean."}
{"text":"Amazing Korean BBQ here!  My gf and I decided to try something new in this plaza and we decided on kobi. The staff was like any other as they greeted us in Korean with smiles on their faces. 

The menu is not as large as some other restaurants, which to me is fine. Just means the dishes should come out at a certain level of quality. Oh man the Korean bbq was on some next level! We ordered thin slices pork belly and large slices pork belly... it was literally heaven. We had meat sauce, wrap sauce, Kimchi soup, steamed egg soup, Kimchi green onion salad and red onions. Out of most of the Korean places I've been to, I haven't seen so many ingredients to use or eat when doing Korean bbq. 

The price for kbbq is actually quite cheap compared to other places. Although you have to order rice separately if you want it. 

I definitely will come back to try more stuff hopefully! I might be stuck on this Korean bbq trip doee"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 Stars - Came here twice thus far and it's pretty spacious. There's quite a number of booths and service was okay. It does get very busy during weekends but they have those bell ringers at the wall so we were able to get the server's attention and everything came out pretty fast. 
I really liked the spicy chicken with cheese. The two portions was enough to feed 4 people. It was DELICIOUS. I highly recommend it. 
We also tried BBQ both times and they're BBQ is average. The meats were not amazing and honestly didn't really satisfy my craving. The grill was a bit higher up than other places so many the heat doesn't transfer as well. My pork belly was cooking for a really really long time and not a lot of grill marks. It was hard to cook really. We got the thick pork belly which was pretty good, the marinated rib steak which was really tender, and flavourful and the skirt steak which was tough and I recommend you not ordering it. The ban chan side dishes had a good variety but they give you very little each time. Most of the dishes tasted pretty good. Overall, a decent choice for KBBQ in the area. They don't have the best variety or choice cuts of meats but it's still very tasty. The grill could be better though."}
{"text":"Decent Korean food but needs AC! We ordered two order of the spicy chicken and cheese ($18.99 each) and two orders of the slice pork belly ($15.99 each) - this was more than enough for 4 people! Do note that they require two minimum orders for table top dishes. 

Koreans are infamous for their 'side dishes' but this restaurant... They're just over the top. Along with the typical side dishes of red kimchi, fish cakes, spinach and beansprouts, they gave a small pot of steamed eggs, a small pot of soy bean paste stew and endless lettuce! I especially love the bowl of tossed spicy green onion and lettuce salad to wrap with the pork belly. On this aspect, Kobi aced it! 

The pork belly was sliced thinly and cooked fast on the grill. So be careful not to burn it! It was crispy and tasted great wrapped in the lettuce and ssamjang. We added ramen to the spicy chicken and it was so spicy! We also got extra cheese (5.99) which was smart because the original portion of the cheese was finished so quickly. 

A downfall... For a BBQ place, there was no AC which is a big no no... We were literally sweating while eating which made it very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I have been to Kobi twice. One for the Spicy Chicken and Cheese Korean Table BBQ and Korean BBQ in general. I feel like out of all the places in the GTA, Kobi offers the best prices in authentic Korean BBQ. Even though the wait at Kobi can be long, the servers are super attentive and nice. They also provide a variety of banchans and they're all very good. When you have korean BBQ, they always hook it up with the steamed egg. Everything is great. They also serve traditional Korean dishes here as well but the focus is more so on Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"If you're here for the spicy meat and cheese, there are more and better options at other Korean restaurants - you are in K-town after all.

They cheaped out with only 5 appetizers instead of the normal 6, and my boyfriend could handle the kimchi spiciness which means that it wasn't spicy or flavourful at all.

The menu wasn't entirely clear as to what a portion of the cheese and chicken was either.

We ordered the Korean noodle tabletop cooking with beef, mushroom and water parsley for two. However, we were not full afterwards -- it was not enough for two.  It was so unappetizing, we didn't even bother taking pictures."}
{"text":"Once I watched a korean drama love story and this couple were having the spicy chicken and cheese dish, I always wanted to try it.

On a date night with my husband, I suggested to try this place. Nothing fancy with the ambiance. Since we came to try the spicy chicken and cheese, we have to order 2 orders as that is the minimum. We thought we won't be able to finish it but we did. You can choose the level of spiciness and we just got the regular spicy. I am not good with spicy food but this is just right for me, need to make sure there is enough cheese.

Very good experience and service."}
{"text":"Love Korean bbq!! Tried few other dishes and they were petty good too. Service can be slow when they are busy. But we always try to avoid busy hours"}
{"text":"Saw lots of pics and heard this place was worth trying.

Ended making a RSVP - which is a must or you will have to wait for a table...

Ordered the infamous chicken and cheese Korean BBQ combo with extra rice cake and udon.  The food was good and worth a try.. The cheese gets stringy..and then gets cold and after they turn off the BBQ for you.. But definitely worth a try if you like Korean rice cake, chicken, and cheese... 2 orders of chicken to begin with for 3 people wasn't really enough chicken..

I would say the Porkbone Kimchi is pretty good, also enjoyed the egg soup and bulgogi pot.. Would definitely order the Porkbone kimchi again..

BBQ meat looks delicious.. Going back this weekend to check that out with larger group of people

*****
Came back a second time with a larger group of people. 

Out reservation for 10 people was 45 past due.. But they compensated by treating us to a round of 12 beers.

Ordered the cheese and meat dishes x 3 and everything on the BBQ menu.

The BBQ meat was ok.. Typical Korean BBQ.. Beef was not tender..

I'm pretty sure I will end up back t this restaurant at some time or another..

Things that I think are worth coming back for,
Seafood pancake
Kimchi cheegae with pork back bone
Seafood Cake Soup
BBQ Bacon Lettuce Wrap - but it tastes good everywhere"}
{"text":"It was all over Instagram and Facebook, and when the hype died down, I paid a visit to FINALLY try it.

I am a huge cheese lover, add cheese to anything and I will eat it (maybe not). The menu itself is not the most straight forward, I had to ask my Korean friend to translate and explain to me how it works since it was my first time, since I wasnt down to sit there and figure out the menu like a math problem.

We obviously ordered the cheese hot pot. Looked like a lot of cheese but when it melt it honestly was not that much. The food itself was decent. I can't call this authentic Korean food, and the cheese part was just too gimmicky. 

Its definitely something to try it out, just replace the amazing food part with fun experience!"}
{"text":"Although the food was really delicious, the service is why I am giving this place a 2 out of 5.  We ordered the sliced beef, pork belly and marinated beef and it was perfect for 3 people.  The side dishes were great as there was a lot of variety. The down side to this place is that the service is not that great, I'm not sure if it's because my party was not korean... we were definitely ignored. We had to ask for water 3 times, it took awhile to get a waiters attention even after ringing the bell.  I wanted to order a Diet Coke and even that took a long time, I actually had to stand up to get someone's attention. When we asked for a few more side dishes, we were denied after our first round.  I think service is so important, I will not be returning as I have had better service at other BBQ restaurants with similar food."}
{"text":"I been here a few times.  I gotta say their BBQ stuff is pretty good. They are marinated really well and taste extra flavourful and add a lil crunch with the lettuce wrap. 
The cheese pot is a little gimmicky because the pot itself taste better without the cheese and pineapple, in my opinion at least...  Add the ramen in to make it a big pot.  
You have to order at least two orders but doesn't have to be the same order of meat.  You can get one order of chicken and one order of squid."}
{"text":"My meal: bbq cheese squid and fried rice at the end of the meal.

It wasn't a bbq over an open flame, but it was cooked on a hot plate over a table burner. Similar to dak-galbi! The squid cooks in the gochujang sauce that has been altered with enough sugar to erase any hint of spicy. Despite the sweetness in the sauce, the whole dish is just plain salty. The squid is salty and when the cheese melts down, it becomes quite salty as well.

I was a bit disappointed with the fried rice as it was extremely salty (it is cooked with the leftover squid) and didn't have aromatics such as gaenip aka perilla leaves aka sesame leaves.

The cheese fondue at the table makes it a fun experience and slightly burned crispy cheese is the best part!

Notes: 
Time management during the meal is essential as you need to manage eating the squid in a timely manner so that it doesn't over cook and become rubbery while also gobbling up the cheese ring before it burns.

Unlimited refills on the banchans. I found these to be quite salty as well.

Steamed egg was gifted to our table! Love service (freebies)! Most salt balanced dish of the evening.

Staff are friendly and help you keep an eye on the cooking process."}
{"text":"Looking for some authentic korean bbq? This is it! I loved it. From the appetizers to soup to the meat. Everything was amazing. Came here on a Saturday night for dinner and obviously there was a huge line up. The wait wasnt too bad. And i was impressed how he rmb us cuz he only verbally gave us a number and he wasnt calling out numbers. He just came up to us and said ur table is ready! 

What i ordered:
Thick cut pork belly dinner for two. 

I also wanted to try the seafood pancake, good thing i didnt cuz the dinner came with soooo much food. 

The appetizers were great. No ur typical bean sprouts and kimchi. They had quite the variety, loved the noodle and the jelly one! Ofc there was kimchi too, but ive had better kimchi, everyone makes it differently. 
The egg pot was amazing!!! Its my fav! So i cant say no to that. The soup that came in the middle of the grill was amazing too! But it got salty towards the end as it was simmering the whole time. Regardless i still reli enjoyed it.  The meat was cut to the perfect thickness and after grilling it to golden brown, it was delicious! Served with green onions, onions, garlic, jalapeños, lettuce and all the sauces, yummmmmmers! 

Knocked off a star cuz they were too busy, nvr refilled water or checked on us. But i am definitely coming back to try the spicy chicken with cheese!"}
{"text":"I came here after some friends had suggested the place to me. The staff was friendly and greeted us right when we walked in, it wasn't too busy during the time I went so we got seated pretty quickly. My friend and I ordered the spicy chicken and spicy squid (minimum of 2 orders) and it came with 5 side dishes (the usual) and steamed egg. The portions were large and very filling, but the chicken wasn't that great. The sauce they used was a little on the sweet side instead of savory. I would come again to try kbbq next time."}
{"text":"I found this Korean BBQ restaurant through Instagram. We came here to try the Seafood and Chicken Hot Pot. With $69.99, you can get a big rectangle pot of seafood (crabs, shrimps, clams, mussels, squids, whole small chicken). They were brought to table raw except the chicken was cooked and the server would add the broth to cook them at table top. I would say the seafood is not extremely top quality, but it is very good value. The quantity can feed 3-4 very hungry adults.

The restaurant also serve table top BBQ for Pork Belly (thick or thin cut), beef ribs. I will definitely go back to try that.

The only complain is the ventilation is not very good, so wear properly or you will smell like BBQ after meal."}
{"text":"Good... but not good enough...

Reading the reviews and looking through the pictures I have to admit I had a bit of expectation for this place. It did not disappoint and the food was fine, but it just didnt blow me away.

Approaching the entrance you might get confused at first since theres 2 \"Kobi\"s - one on the left, and one on the right. The one you are going to is the one on the left (the one with the patio). The place itself is a good size with plenty of booths available. I personally like booth seats and the one I sat in had walls on either side so it was a nice space to eat with friends.

The menu isnt huge but it should be enough of what you need to order. After choosing your meat, everything comes in a huge cast iron pan with a ring of cheese, yup you read that right, a ring of shredded mozarella cheese on the outside. Once everything starts heating up on the stove, the aromas starts coming out and everything starts melting BUT after a while, the waitress will move that pan to a gas stove of which is not big enough to heat the cheese part so all that just cools down and turns hard... sadness there. So, either eat you up the cheese before she comes, or just bear with cooled shredded cheese.

Prices are decent and similar what other places in the area would charge you for. With a party of 6, and ordering extras like rice and side dishes, you'll probably ring up to around $35~$40 per person.

More of a one time visit for me as there wasnt really a wow factor, but it is a place to visit especially with small groups."}
{"text":"Tldr the food is good but expensive. 

I've been here twice and both times were shocked at the price  (silly me to be shocked twice). The ambiance and service is decent overall.  Each table has these half walls so there's a lot of privacy. The waitresses and waiters cook the meat for you so that's work off your shoulders.

The food has been good each time (kbbq and dakgalbi with cheese). Kbbq is like beef cooked in front of you. Dakgalbi is spicy chicken that comes with melted Mozzarella cheese which is a delicious combination. But for 2 people the kkbq was over $50 and the chicken was over $40. It's the same whether you go for lunch or dinner although they do have some lunch specials that aren't cooked at the table (but then you might as well go to any other korean restaurant in the area). 

My advice is just think about what dish you want and then look around the area for less expensive alternatives. There are tons of places close by that do kbbq or korean dishes or dakgalbi for less expensive and just as tasty."}
{"text":"Came here to try out this new hype with dipping the spicy chicken in a cheese ring.

Spicy Chicken with Cheese ($18.99)
It was minimum 2 servings to order this, so essentially it costs $28 bucks to order it since $18.99 is the cost of one serving. The chicken wasn't too spicy, more on the sweet side, really tasty. It came with onions, thinly sliced potatoes, and rice cakes. You also have the option of adding more ingredients if you think its not filling enough. Careful with the cheese though, ours burnt fast and harden - it only tastes good when you dip the chicken in the oosey cheese. If you ordered other items, you might want to just focus on eating the chicken and cheese ring first. I know in most eyes people will think this is a gimmicky kind of thing, which no lie it is, but I'm a cheese lover so I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Marinated Pork Ribs ($18.99) & Pork Belly ($16.99)
We ordered bbq grill food - marinated pork ribs and pork belly. The marinated pork ribs was for patio only. The meat was tender, not chewy or tough at all which I liked. Goes really well dipping in the soya sauce mixed with raw onions. The pork belly portion was smaller than I expected it to be - came with only 3 long strips and the pieces were really fat, probably 40% meat. After grilling it, mixing it with the spicy onions and korean sauces in a lettuce wrap tastes really good. I still think the pork belly alone lacked flavor though. The grill also comes with a soy bean hot pot soup which was good, but felt small as it was less than half full.

The service was not the greatest. We were sitting at the patio outside so it was hard to get a hold of them, and when we did they seemed frustrated. 
Overall the food was good, I do think its more towards the expensive side but I enjoyed my meal and I would come again."}
{"text":"As a Korean who frequents Korean BBQ, I can say that this place has one of the better meat  in GTA.
I am satisfied with everything about this location except that the ventilation is very lacking leading to quite a fair bit of smoke build-up during dinner time and the smell to your clothes like crazy.
Ample amount of plaza parking is always great to have."}
{"text":"I tentatively give four stars with some reservations. This was my first experience of the trend of Korean spicy chicken/bbq meets melted cheese/raclette. Our group of six ordered so much that we had 3 portable cooking elements going on simultaneously (assorted KBBQ, spicy chicken with cheese, seafood hotplate with cheese). The KBBQ was marginally better than average, if not just acceptable. The two plates involving melted cheese were very enjoyable (though subject to personal bias from my initial fascination of cheesy Korean meat). Staff and service were fantastic; they were extremely friendly and accommodating, with one of the waiters periodically returning to check on stove power and to ensure our seafood was mixed and cooked properly. Only major complaint is the price point is at odds with the volume of food delivered, most notably for orders of KBBQ. If I were to return, I would not come back for the KBBQ based on this experience, reducing this place---in my eyes---to a one trick pony. There are other places that serve melted cheese offerings and only after visiting them will I be able to re-evaluate this place."}
{"text":"I ordered Spicy Chicken and Squid with Cheese along with Salted Beef and Shred Pork Belly. I would highly recommend this place as the waiters would occasionally visit our table to help us mix our Spicy Chicken and Squid to ensure it it well cooked. They have a \"help\" button for each table where the waiters literally arrive at your table moments after pressing the button. Definitely had a memorable experience. Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"3.5

I love spicy sauce, and am in love with cheese...so of course I had to try this place, since it specializes in \"Spicy Chicken Cheese\" and \"Spicy Squid Cheese.\" 

FOOD:

I went with the chicken this time, and was pretty impressed with the chicken portions, as mixed in with white onions, yams, and peppers. As you would think, this dish is pretty hot, but not \"I need a glass of milk right now!\" hot...this would probably be well tolerated by most. Most of the mains come with the traditional array of Korean apps, as well as a steamed egg soup (which was pleasantly fluffy and filling). The menu selection is not huge, but other decent options Korean/BBQ options available here too.

PRICE:

I must say I'm not a fan of the way pricing is displayed in the menu. There's some vague note about \"minimum 2 portions.\" In the menu though, there's a picture of \"2 portions\" of the spicy chicken/squid ($36+) listing the \"one portion\" price ($18+). A bit misleading in my opinion...Other than this, the rest of the prices were fairly standard for this type of place. 

SERVICE:

Given how busy they were on a Friday night, they were actually surprisingly attention. They were quick to respond to the bell notifications that some Korean BBQ places have. I did start wondering about the possibility of the whole place burning down though, because the servers don't really seem to explain how and how long to operate the grill...and when to turn it off - they just kind of assumed we knew?

VERDICT: 

A bit stuffy and crowded, but a decent place to grab some spicy/cheesy food and/or soju on a weekend."}
{"text":"Went to this Korean restaurant about 12pm, me and my friend ordered a spicy chicken with cheese and a cold noodles. We've overestimated the amount of spicy chicken, we thought it would be just a small amount so that we ordered a cold noodles with beef bulgogi. The set dishes and the steamed egg cane along were good but the kimchi and the egg were relatively lack of flavour. For the spicy chicken with cheese, the chicken wasn't that spicy and we didn't get to choose the spiciness. While the cheese didn't workout as we expected, we couldn't stretch it out to cover the chicken or anything in the pot. And lastly for the cold noodles and beef, the cold noodles had no flavour, you'll need to add some mustard and vinegar."}
{"text":"i was super excited to try this restaurant, but sadly am very disappointed with the experience. My friends and i order 3 different kinds of bibimbap [sp?] and some water. Our water came first, i immediately noticed that my cup had a funny smell, so i put my napkin in it to see if it was dirty and pulled back black/dark brown smears. I had to ask for new glasses which thankfully were clean. I was still happy to try the food, and thought nothing of it as mistakes do happen. We finally got our order and low and behold, the chicken in my dish had been cooked on the outside and was raw in the middle. I'm no connoisseur of korean food but i know that shouldn't have been what i recieved. 

I do have to say though that as soon as i asked the waitstaff for anything they were really kind to me and my friends. Waitstaff is good, but beware of the food"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon and decided to binge on the cheesey spicey chicken and spicey squid mix. This was my 2nd time here and I had to say it gave a better impression than the first time. I guess it was because the afternoon was their down time while friday dinner time (which was when I went the first time) was kinda too crazy for the service and food to keep up. 

The service was better, the lady came to check up on us a couple of times throughout the meal and refilled our side dishes, the food came fast and the definitely not as over cooked as my first experience. 

So my advice, go for lunch or late lunch instead of dinner. You would get a better meal experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I had such a good time here tonight with my friends! 

The service was very friendly even though we had to ask multiple times for some things, but they were really busy so I'll give them that. 

The food was very satisfying. We ordered beef ribs and pork belly, along with the spicy chicken with cheese (minimum two orders) -and it was all so good! The melted cheese just makes it 10x better! The beef was deliciously marinated. They were very generous with sides, there were 5 of us and they gave us double the sides. It also comes with tofu soup that gets heated in the middle of the grill. We had also ordered the seafood pancake -very crispy at the edges! And calamari. Everything came to a total of less than $35 per person after tax and tips! 

A must try for Korean bbq lovers! I will definitely come back for more. Make sure to go in a group to make room for the kbbq meats and the minimum 2 orders of spicy chicken/squid."}
{"text":"Really close to 4 stars, but due to the crap service they get 3.

Not nearly enough staff, and since it's ALWAYS busy there they really need fix this. It takes forever to be seated, even if you have a reso, and forever to get a servers attention during the meal. Also, needs AC and better ventilation. 

Food is good tho. Menu a bit limited imo but loveeeee the spicy chicken with cheese ring. We always save half and add some rice and kimchi and onions and pork and cook it all up on the hot plate and make our own killer rice dish!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I have never had chicken and cheese more delicious than Kobi's. The staff and the manager is very friendly. My boyfriend and I try to come here as often as we can. The booths are also spacious and they often play kpop, which is a bonus for me. I love eating here."}
{"text":"Kobi Korean BBQ serves authentic Korean food. 

I highly recommend the cold noodle Naengmyeon as the noodle which was long and thin has a different texture compares to other restaurant in the area. As the noodle was imported from Korea so it is as close as the \"real\" thing as you can expect. Perfect on a hot summer day and the different shredded vegetables made it look so colourful!

I would be back to try their BBQ, especially the Spicy Chicken with Cheese which looks really interesting. Unfortunately, minimum of 2 orders so I have to bring more people to share in order to try other food.

Who can resist some good meat..."}
{"text":"I didn't really understand the hype about this place even before I came, and after trying it, I still don't. We went for the chicken and cheese, which is one of their more unique offerings. It comes in an interesting pan with chicken, rice cakes, vegetables, etc. in the middle of the pan, and a separate section surrounding it which is filled with shredded cheese, which melts once cooked. We also ordered the Kobi Nabi, which is like a bunch of stuff cooked in broth - apparently it's like Korean street food but just seemed like regular hotpot to me (except all the food is preselected for you and already placed in the broth.) This came with a couple skewers of fish cakes, udon noodles, dumplings, eggs, and mussels. The food tasted okay, but it was like $20 and I just looked at it thinking about how even I could prepare something like this at home, and I don't even like to cook. Like boiled eggs, dumplings, and udon? That was pretty much my every day diet while I was a student at school, give me a break...

The spicy chicken with cheese we ordered was okay but didn't blow me away. We requested for it to be made less spicy, but I still found it to be a bit too spicy. The main issue I found was that there wasn't enough time to enjoy the whole thing before the cheese dried out and got hard. We also found the lack of instruction and attention from the staff to be a bit frustrating. After the initial set up, our waitress helped us stir around the meat and veggies for a bit and then disappeared, never to be seen again. We weren't sure if the food was ready to be eaten, so just sat around waiting for a bit until we got too hungry. I didn't even think it was that exciting to dip the food into the cheese (like fondue) - I greatly prefer it when the cheese is just mixed into the food, like at Joon's.

We ordered two portions of the spicy chicken with cheese (minimum two orders required), the Kobi Nabi, and two bowls of steamed rice for four people and it was more than enough food. The chicken and cheese also came with a little bowl of steamed egg. Price-wise it ended up being quite cheap because we paid less than $20/person, but even so, I don't think I liked it enough to come back."}
{"text":"To be completely honest, my friend and I didn't want to travel all the way downtown for a Korean cheese dish so we decided to come to Kobi. I've been here before but I didn't order the cheese dish since I wasn't too hungry. However, being hit with major hunger, my friend and I decided to go ahead and order the Spicy chicken and Squid cheese dish.

The menu might be a little confusing, but essentially you need to have 2 orders per table for the Korean Cheese dish. The chicken and the squid can be combined BUT the other two dishes cannot be mixed and matched lol. Anyways, the menu might drive you a little crazy BUT at least it makes you even more hungry. 

Once the dish arrived, the staff graciously came over to help us cook the meat (I guess they noticed that we can't cook). The cheese had corn and pineapple in it and it was a great addition to the meat. You can choose how spicy you want the meat to be and we went with just mild. It was the perfect amount of spice and I highly recommend it to people who aren't good with spicy food because its actually not too bad. Better than having no spices on your meat!

We ended up having some left over vegetables and cheese since it was just the two of us so I would assume that this dish would be perfect for a party of three and will go there with an extra person next time.

Very good experience and service, can't wait to come back with more people!"}
{"text":"This was pretty good Korean BBQ place the pork belly tasted great!  The side dishes were good.  I would definitely come. Back here again.  They gave lots of lettuce to wrap the meat which was great.  The BBQ stove was nice our meat never stuck to the grill.  The service was good people in there are very friendly.  

The ventilation like most BBQ is poor and you will smell like BBQ afterwards. But aside from that its one of the better places to have BBQ. If you've never tried this place definitely go and check it out."}
{"text":"It is open in a random plaza but close to other Korean restaurants in the neighbourhood, including PAT Supermarket (Korean based). 

The entrance area is very spacious. Kind of a waste of space. They can decorate it better or use it more effectively. Most seating area are booth like since they need one exhaust system per table due to the BBQ. 

The washroom is big, clean and nice. 

I tried a soup: dried cabbage and beef and I was surprised it was Nappa Cabbage!! Not the real cabbage. So I felt tricked. However, the overall broth taste was not salty and it was tasty. The beef pieces were scattered everywhere and had a decent amount. 

The small apps were good and they kindly refilled them. 

My partner had the pork bone soup and he devoured it. But there was not a piece of potato for me. 

Service was great for a Korean place!! 

They have lunch specials which some are bento boxes. Their BBQ menu can be pricey. 

Verdict: Yes I would go back to try another dish!! And especially if I need to go the Korean Supermarket 1 minute away."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday around 7:30 for 2ppl. Note for next time, DO NOT WALK IN AT THIS TIME!! Wait time was about an hour, we didn't reserve because they only do reservations for groups of 4 or more. 

We ordered the spicy chicken & spicy squid with cheese. We also did the kbbq with salted beef and pork belly. Everything was really good and well worth the wait in my opinion. They also offered free dokbokki on the house for the wait time! Food came very quickly once we were seated and everyone was very friendly. Would come again but with reservations and maybe not at that time!!"}
{"text":"Went with a couple friends having heard good things and particularly being drawn to the cheesy kimchi group bowls. There were 5 of us and we ordered both squid and chicken cheese dishes and two orders of thick pork belly. While I found both very good, the portion was lacking for the price. Also the menu is a bit misleading listing the price at ~20 individually, but making you order in at least two orders. We ended up having to order an additional order of beef and cold noodles. Again, they were good but small portions and generally overpriced. Worth a visit if you ever want to splurge a bit, maybe pick elsewhere if you're feeling particularly hungry."}
{"text":"The meal came with lettuce, bowl of red onions, bowl of spicy cabbage and green onions, bowl of soy paste soup, bowl of steamed egg, rice and five side dishes. There were three sauces, one for soaking the red onions in and two for dipping. Wrapping the meat in lettuce with all the fillings, it was delicious. The pork belly was fat and the grill made the sides crunchy. The marinated beef was tender and flavourful. Pretty expensive considering what comes in an order. It was filling and it was nice to try something new.

Ran by real Korean people, waitress wasn't great at English so don't expect answers to questions that are a little too long. She was trying to be helpful but she put the entire plate of meat on the grill all at once. The meat all ended up cooking and couldn't eat it fast enough so had to put it to the side and eat cool meat.

Overall, will come back for some lettuce wrapped grilled meat in the future but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've gone to Kobi a few times just for dinner for the delicious authentic kbbq! Reservations are a must even on weekdays if you would like to eat here. If no reservations are made you may have to go as early as 5pm to get a table (without waiting). I've gone on a busy week night at around 5:30-6pm to find that even at this early time, I had to wait about 30-40 minutes for a table (for a party of 4). The restaurant has two entrances (side by side) and there is no difference to which door you enter from (although it can get confusing once there are people waiting around). 

Kbbq is a must get here! The meats you get to choose from are fresh and delicious! There are often different cuts of beef to choose from as well as pork belly. Once ordered, the meal comes with many side dishes, a salad mix, lettuce, soup (in the middle), a steamed egg, rice, onions, a soya sauce mixture to dip your meat, as well as several dipping sauces. The table definitely gets filled up quickly with all the side dishes. The best part is when you get to eat all the delicious meat! You can wrap it in a saam or eat it on it's own. It is really up to you! Delicious.

Other things I've also tried are the oden (love the fish cakes!) as well as the pancake (equally delicious). Definitely will be coming back for more kbbq in the future (even perhaps to try the spicy chicken with cheese)!"}
{"text":"Amazing food with amazing company. I was here a week ago to celebrate my friend's birthday. Unfortunately,  the vents were being replaced so we couldn't do the table cooking. Everything was cooked in the back and brought to us which was fine. The cheesey dish with spicy chicken was so good! Came with sides and steamed egg. Service was ok, pricing is average. Would come again for the cheese."}
{"text":"So much buzz and hype over this place.  Well, glad to say it lives up it!
Needed a new place as Sariwon has been getting a little disappointing lately.  I listened to the Yelpers and went to Kobi.  Not sure about the whole Cheese thingy - I can't say it's very Korean as I think a lot of us are lactose intolerant...burp...urp...sorry!
Had the pork and marinated kalbi.  Also ordered the SoonTofu Stew for one of the little ones and PahJun - seafood pancake.  The PahJun was a little oily and since we came sometime between late lunch and early dinner - maybe it was re-fried?
Have to say, the spread was fantasic.  Lots of BahnChahn to nibble on while we wait for the DehnJang Stew to boil - it was placed in the centre of the barbecue in a stone bowl...Nice!
The meats were good quality and the steamed egg, that came as a service item, was really tasty.  
I kept making comparisons between Kobi and SariWon.

Meats = Tie (Kobi's portions were a bit smaller)
DehnJang Stew = SariWon (still the best for this item)
Steamed Egg = SariWon (by a little bit)
BahnChahn = Tie
SoonTofu Stew = Tie (not a specialty at either place)
Restaurant  = Sariwon
Service = Tie
BBQ equipment = Sariwon has better grill (natural gas with infrared) but Kobi's equipment - not as elegant - delivers great BBQ

Not a clear cut winner.  How about this.  Kobi is over 25% less for a comparable meal - however, SariWon give more meat but nowhere near the amount to justify a 25% delta.  Not a total 5 Star but real close!

The fam and I have found a new place to hang out and get our BBQ on!  

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of hungry gals. We ordered the spicy chicken with cheese, pork belly and beef spare ribs bbq, some noodles and fish cakes. We all left with a super satisfied belly. Spicy chicken has quite the kick for those who don't usually eat spicy food. Service was quick and we got some free dishes on the house."}
{"text":"They never let me down!
've been there couple times. They are famous for their cheesy chicken but their beef bbq is excellent too."}
