{"text":"Ordered food around 8:00 now it's around   11:30, called twice but no answer- weird for a restaurant that is open until 1:30 A.M and has already charged my credit card. When I finally got my food it was cold and sucked- I'm not a food snob either (papa John or dominos delivery pizza is fine by me). The pizza was awful, wings were soggy, and mozzarella sticks were cold on the inside. If you're looking for good service and food aim elsewhere this place was awful- bad enough for me to take the time to download this app, and make a review.."}
{"text":"Nice little spot. Good affordable wings. Good service for a bar. Pool tables are in decent shape. I would recommend this spot for a good time if your in town for the night."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is wrong.

I checked in a hotel near this restaurant and ordered some food for delivery. It took me 3 calls to place the order. Food arrived after good 2 hours. French fries are soggy, soup is bland and salad is shit. They didn't even have the courtesy to apologize and wave off the charge for the delay. Plz, Plz stay away from this. 

I completely hate this hotel. I hope they have -1 rating."}
{"text":"That was the most poorly spent money I have ever given a restaurant. It took two hours to deliver. Once it arrived, the food was cold and soggy. I couldn't eat any of it. I don't think there's any reason for anyone to ever order delivery from here, I should have heeded the warnings."}
{"text":"We missed our connecting flight because U.S. Airways is never reliable to be on time.  We got to our hotel and ordered from Bankers.  The lady who answered the phone was very nice and helpful.  The fried mushrooms were good.  The wings in barbalo sauce was great.  We also ordered fries and onion rings.  They do not overload you with food.  The delivery guy helped us open our beers (definitely needed it after running through the airport) since we did not have an opener.  The service was quick and we enjoyed all that we ordered.  I would definitely recommend if you were visiting or stuck in Charlotte for the night."}
{"text":"Not the best atmosphere but, hands down best lemon pepper wing ever! Drinks are cheap. I had lemon pepper wings other places never enjoyed like these."}
{"text":"The staff was extremely friendly. Fried pickles and lemon pepper wings were on point. Will be back to drink and eat again."}
{"text":"Flight cancelled. Stuck in a hotel. Bankers Raw Bar to the rescue! They delivered my Reuben sandwich and strawberry shortcake in just a few minutes. The food was really great. And, they thought of everything from extra napkins to whipped cream!"}
{"text":"This place a hole in the wall next to a dirty looking strip club. I'm reading the reviews about it and I am shocked. The crowd was hood. The music was hood. The food took over an hour. They ran out of the one drink special that they had. There was a lady there climbing all over the tables looking for a man to go home with. 
They did have good drink prices and the staff was polite. Not well informed but kind. 
There was a fight in the bar that was taken outside to the parking lot where a man was shot so the bar was closed. The police had the place roped off and we were stuck there for two hours. 
I will not be back."}
{"text":"Decent little bar, grill and pool hall. Bottled beers are icy cold.  Oysters are always good and cheap too!  Chili is pretty good as well.  Definitely deserves better than 2 stars! Music can be a bit loud at times..."}
{"text":"My flight was cancelled and I was stuck at a hotel where my choices were dominos, Chinese, or this place. I wanted something \"healthier\" so I ordered grilled chicken, steamed veggies, and a cup of French onion soup. It was 7:30 PM on a Sunday and she said it would be 45 minutes. Fast forward to 8:35 PM, I call, and they say the food has left the kitchen and should arrive shortly. Fast forward again to 8:50 and I get a knock on my door (now 35 mins late). I ask if there's silverware and they say yes. I open my food, there is no spoon for my soup. So I go to the lobby and get one, already in my PJs and not particularly wanting to leave my room. Come back and open my soup. It's French onion, and it's HORRIBLE. Worse than of it were made from a packet. Cheese is cold, broth is hot, super super salty... just horrible. My steamed veggies are... sub-par. And my chicken is cold and rubbery. I couldn't even eat it. Don't go here, Order literally ANYTHING else or get some easy Mac from the hotel lobby. You'll be happier."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery to a hotel room at 12:15am and I was impressed! It took an hour, but that's exactly what they predicted and they weren't a minute late! All the food was fresh, really good and the driver was really nice. When I tipped a $5, for coming all the way up to my room, he was very appreciative, unlike some. I was happy I tipped him well. He seemed to deserve it."}
{"text":"I've physically have been here and gotten delivery from this place on numerous occasions. So keep that in mind with this review - General Service is awful, customer service is even worse. Food is below average. I travel the country for a living so it's safe to say I've been to numerous places and this is low on the list. They deliver but plan to wait almost 2hours for food. No different if you actually go there to eat, you'll be waiting 2 hours also for food. Food tastes like they haven't changed their fry oil in a very long time."}
{"text":"Horrible stay away everything is horrible here from food to service and delivery. We ordered delivery from our hotel la Quinta. Food was delivered 2 hours late horrible tasting cold food grilled chicken tastes like I was eating rubber. Stay away. Better stay hungry then eat at this place"}
{"text":"Stuck in the hotel in the rain without a car and they delivered. A pleasant surprise, BBQ was pretty good but a bit wet, clam chowder and chili was excellent and 2 cold beers delivered with the food. Good prices and large servings."}
{"text":"I ordered the oysters on the half shell & it was quite an experience.  They were served in a plastic bowl & the hot sauce, cocktail sauce & horseradish were served in plastic containers (i was appalled). The oysters were not cleaned prior to being served ~ I spit out bits of shells with every oyster. I ate 3 \o/ ~~ I'm used to my oysters served on a bed of ice in a metal dish & the condiments served in mini glass bowls ~~ but hey u live & learn. 

I had the marinated steak bites & they were ok. The Long Island iced tea was PERFECT!!!!! I'm definitely going back when I feel the urge to have a Long Island. 

I looked around at other plates & the fried food looks good. You can shoot pool or have a private conversation off to the side without yelling over the music. The bartender I had was nice & kept me informed on the status of my food. 

I would give this place another visit but I'm skipping out on the \"raw\" bar."}
{"text":"So we got stuck in Charlotte thanks to Winter Storm Jonas. And American gave us a free room at the Ramada. We immediately went looking for a place to eat and drink the night away and were referred to Bankers by the front desk. 

The Panthers were playing that day in the NFC Championship so we were jazzed to watch the game in Charlotte at a local bar with the locals. And we got locals! Oh man, first we walked in thinking that this was going to be awful. The floor isn't the greatest, bathrooms... Let's ignore those. People turned around to stare at us, I assume because we were unfamiliar. The lights were dim... Geez. It was not good. But we decided to stick it out. Man, I was glad we did. Drinks were cheap, service was fast, food was GOOD. We only encountered one issue and that was with our food. Apparently it got put in wrong, so the owner came over and apologized, bought us a round of drinks and all was well. And she was super nice as well! 

Don't be fooled by the bar itself. It's worth the time! If we got stuck in Charlotte, I would definitely head back."}
{"text":"I've tried about 30 reubens now on my adventure around Charlotte to find the best one, and this was one of the worst without a doubt. The reuben just tasted like salt - after one bite that was literally all you could taste. I'm not sure if it was the corned beef or what but it was just not a good reuben. Also it took about 30 minutes - I'm fairly certain they just forgot about it for 25 of those. If you're going in there to drink it looked like an OK time, but if the rest of the food is anything like the reuben I'd steer clear."}
{"text":"Was stuck in Charlotte overnight due to a missed flight. The nice girl at the front desk said this place delivered till 1:30. And they also deliver beer. I needed that. We had the honey hot wings which were great , the fried mushrooms where awesome , the beer was cold. The one bad thing , the pizza sucked. 
All in all great place to end the night after the day I had."}
{"text":"Had problems with this room service option the first two nights I was here. House salad missing items , missing condiments,more just attention to detail. Called them and they offered me a $15 voucher great day three use the voucher outstanding everything perfect. Decided to go back for a day 4 bad mistake. Ordered the fillet it's supposed to be one of their specials. Incredibly tough. Ordered a baked potato with sour cream and butter you would think it would come on the side. But of course it didn't and it was completely melted throughout the styro foam container.  I could live with that but the house salad I ordered missing ingredients again but most of all no salad dressing. When I called back to tell them I don't want anymore vouchers just you all don't know anything about attention to detail. I let them know I was missing the salad dressing and the person who sent it insisted I must be missing it. Now they are coming back with more salad dressing. Honestly I am done with these folks I'll never use them again.  I love staying at Marriott properties but if this is what they recommend shame on them."}
{"text":"Wings are great. Love the bar employees and the crowd. It's a good mixed crowd where u r likely to hear everything from country to hip hop. Stop by for a great time."}
{"text":"We had their food delivered to our hotel and it was excellent! We had the Fried Flounder Platter! It had a lot of food for such a small price, it comes with 3 pieces of flounder, a baked potato (made any way you like), and you get to choose an extra side! It was perfectly cooked and the delivery man was very friendly, so was the staff over the telephone. When they quote you a delivery time, they are extremely accurate."}
