{"text":"Was excited to try as I had heard how great it was.  We didn't order bbq which looked really good and was really expensive.  We ordered stews and dolsot bibimbap and it was ok.  Portions were small and was irritated when we asked for side dish replacements they told us it would take awhile and didn't replace.  Poor attitudes from our waiter."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the service is amazing and fast. If you want good Korean food, I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The smell of pigs getting grilled is so amazing!  From the parking lot my mouth was watering already. You can taste the bacon in the air.  Food is little pricey here but well worth it.  The meat they use are far better quality than you will find at other kbbq's.  Can't begin to tell you how good the beef was.  Im not even going to attempt to describe the pork belly.   Side dishes were a little different but good.   We also ordered pork bone soup here.   Not the best one I had but still good.  Just keep in mind not to come here when you are very hungry.  It will probably cost you an arm and leg.  You are forced to order 2 orders of meat when you do the bbq thing.   Each order is a minimum of $18 and the portions are not very generous.   Will I come back... I will stop coming when i see a pig fly!!!  Lol"}
{"text":"My husband just loves this place! Usually we are coming during the lunch and the place is pretty empty at that time. The service is very fast and the food is amazing. We have tried so many soup options and all of them are really delicious. BBQ is really good especially pork belly but to be honest its a bit pricy. The quality of food is so good that's why we are always coming back to that place."}
{"text":"The first time I came here with my boyfriend, the restaurant was pretty empty when we got there. We got great service; it was our first time there so the waiters/waitresses probably thought we would kill ourselves eating meat that was not well cooked.   We ordered samgyeopsal and a nengmyun (the plain one). The meat was juicy and we got a lot of side dishes. There were many side dishes; some pumpkin paste thing, a pancake, a lettuce salad, kimchi, and several other dishes that escape my memory. The bowl of nengmyun was huge, but was kind of bland. In the end, we got a complimentary small bowl of plum juice as dessert. Great food and experience, was definitely worth the price.   We went there again today and it was disappointing compared to the previous time. We ordered more portions because we had 3 people, but the portions were smaller compared to the previous time. We also ordered the spicy nengmyun, which is pretty good flavour-wise, but it seems that their portion decreased in size. The place was still fairly empty, yet the waiters did not check up on us at all. At the end, the bill was hefty and we didn't even get plum juice. I don't know why they decided to cheap out this time because we didn't even go at a busy time.   Don't know if I will return again because it is really a hit and miss."}
{"text":"This is my fav Korean BBQ resto in town!  If you sit in the main dining room, your grill is heated with red hot charcoal and we all know charcoal makes any barbecue tastes better!  This visit we had a large group so we sat in the smaller more private room and had electric grills. Nonetheless, still very tasty!  We had seafood pancake, dumplings, pork bone soup, Beef Galbi, Pork Galbi, Pork Belly.  Everything was so delicious! We also had some grapefruit and citron soju. Yum Yum Yum!  If you're coming on the weekend, make a reservation first as they are quite busy! At the end of your meal, a little shot of sweet plum juice is offered which nicely cleanses your mouth of all the juicy meat you've devoured.  Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"The \"Naeng Myun\" (cold noodle) was good and I had a remarkable experience! The vermicelli in the bowl got a unique texture. It's so thin that it's hard to cut off, but really springy.  (you can ask for scissors if you have hard time to cut off hte vermicelli)"}
{"text":"Great staff, great food I love the BBQ pork belly and spicy cold noodles"}
{"text":"Watch out for this place.  If you are not Korean or even if you are Korean but not Korean-speaking, they try to rip you off.  We have been there a number of times and whenever you get BBQ, it comes with a soy bean soup and rice.  This most recent time, when we ordered the BBQ, they didn't serve it with rice and the soy bean soup.  We asked the waiter if it was coming, and he tried to tell us that we had to order it separately.  Then we grabbed a menu and showed the manager that it says it comes with rice and soy bean soup.  She then changed her story a number of times, and then said it was coming.   By that point, we were too pissed to eat and paid for the meal without tipping and stormed out, vowing never to come back again.  If it happened to us, when we speak a bit of Korean, I suspect it happens quite often to non-Koreans."}
{"text":"Oh God. The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because the portions were so tiny yet so very expensive. My whole family (four people in total) went with a voucher my awesome sister purchased that gave us $20 off with tip (came out to $70 when it woulda normally cost us $90). Anyway, worse than Japanese Tapas tiny. Had to eat more crap afterwards when I got home & I hate places that give gargantuan portions. I'd almost rather have wimpy portions than enormous ones because I have this dreadful habit of finishing everything on my plate since I was always told that food is precious & to never waste it. Still, I ate pork ribs straight off the bone to the last sliver, ate other people's food like the Mealtime Magpie I usually am, ate most of the side dishes-- & was still hungry! Perhaps the staff took advantage of the fact we were using a voucher... or I was simply THAT HUNGRY where a Turducken stuffed into a camel wouldn't have sufficed. Anyway, when we all went there not long after the grand opening, the family & I ordered something similar & got so much food it physically hurt to chew when we weren't even through with the whole bowl/plate. I guess if you're all about quality over quantity, this place wouldn't disappoint but most definitely, their portions shrunk, the prices shot up & I got exponentially disastrous at dietary moderation."}
{"text":"I don't think I will go back to piggys due to poor communication, they served us with half of the proportion of the soup.  We complained to the waiter and he was kinda rude , he said is like this and can not change .  We were like okay.  Is sad to let piggy go of my list but at that moment we felt we were begging for food .  This is not right."}
{"text":"Was sold by their huge dumplings! Love the pancake they included with the side dishes. Shared the spicy cabbage and beef short rib stew and bulgogi stew. The dumplings were good but could use more flavour. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"All these good reviews must have been from before they renovated.   After their renovation prices had gone up, portions have gone down, guess someone has to pay.  They give the  same amount of side dishes for a party of 2 or a party of 6.   We tried asking for more, 3 times, and they never brought any.   We gave up on waiting, and asked for the bill.  The bill came within 30 seconds.  Wow to that.   Very tight and uncomfortable seating, plates are jambed up to your chest and the booth seats are 90 angle.   Unless you find that comfortable, and like paying for overpriced food don't go."}
{"text":"I've been here over a dozen times and have not been disappointed once. Service is friendly and quick and I've never had to wait despite the restaurant usually being almost packed. The kalbi is the best I've ever eaten thus far and being a korean, I think that means a lot. You pretty much wont be disappointed with anything on the menu. I will definitely continue to indulge myself at piggy's!"}
{"text":"Have been craving for Korean BBQ lately and I am glad we picked the Piggy's Restaurant.   Everything we tried was delicious, highly recommended - BBQ pork shoulder and pork belly with DIY lettuce wrap, the massive pork dumplings and the Albap ( - The Stone Bowl Bibimbap with Caviar and Fish Roe).  The restaurant is on a good location, right on the corner of Yonge Street and Glen Cameron Road, easy to find, enough parking spaces and many stores in the plaza to shop before/after the meal. The atmosphere inside the restaurant was great, we didn't have to wait long on Saturday dinner time, maybe because of the long weekend. The spaces between tables are decent unlike some Korean restaurants are cramped and you can hardly move once you are seated.  All the food we ordered were delicious, we were so impressed by their tasty massive dumplings, the premium pork shoulder and pork belly for BBQ (fresh and juicy though not cheap) and the Stone Bowl Bibimbap with Caviar and Fish Roe. The side dishes were also tasty and delicious, not many selections but just enough for our dinner. Their unique salad with poppy seed dressing was fabulous which I never had at another Korean restaurant.   Their excellent customer service is worth to mention, all servers were diligent, friendly and helped you with your requests quickly, so amazing!. They sliced and grilled the meat for you and constantly came to check if everything is ok  We had a fantastic dinner here, will come again soon."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here many times.  We have gone through half the menu already.  Nothing has been disappointing.  Best though are the marinated pork bbq, pork bone soup, kimchi stew, and stewed pork ribs.    As of every typical Asian restaurants (that are not high end), the service is just okay.  They bring you what you need when you ask for it.  They will not come by every once in a while to ask what you require, so just get their attention."}
{"text":"The food is authentic, pretty good. However the portions are not too big for the price. The side dishes were standard, one side dish I haven't had before - looked like mashed pumpkin was interesting. Haven't seen it being served in any other Korean restaurants. Will I go back again? maybe...maybe not."}
{"text":"Typical Korean restaurant with slow service. Came in to the restaurant at 1pm, got seated and ordered but haven't received food for 45 minutes. There were only 3 waitresses working at the entire restaurant that was completely full. I felt bad for them, they were literally running around with their carts. It was a good thing that the food was pretty good when it actually came though."}
{"text":"It's a nice restaurant. We have pork born soup and beef broth with rice. The pork born was not as spicy as I would like . The beef is a bit too sweet. The side dishes are very good. The trouble is we were very thirsty an hour later which mean there must be a  lot of MSG. I notice the customer were all Korean, I guess it must be a local favorite."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's a clean, spacious, and modern Korean restaurants.  Unlike most typical Korean restaurants on Bloor street.  I've been here once with my friends and would absolutely come back.  My favourite dish, and I would recommend is Dolsot Bibimbap, we also order Gam Ja Tang to share as a group."}
{"text":"For a party of 3, we ordered samgyupsal bbq and it was an excellent choice. This is meant to be pork with fatty parts on it, and the ratio of meat/fat was just right. The restaurant also provides a good variety of side dishes, and are happy to refill it if needed. Really liked the sesame dressing on the salad, never had something like this before. I also appreciated that they told us to hold off ordering a 3rd portion of meat until we were sure - we definitely did not need it and would have wasted it. I noticed the menu has some unique soups, which I will certainly try on my next visit."}
{"text":"Long waits for a table - but totally worth it and would line up again!  Opted for the Korean BBQ and ordered the So Joo Mul Leok (#52) - sliced beef ribs marinated in garlic. Came with about 8 salads to start off the meal and our servers helped us get the bbq started and even flipped our meats and cut them up for us.   Salads were delicious and the meats were superb! 10/10 Service was a 10/10  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Bad service! Ordered 4 naengmyun cold noodles and all the noodles were extremely soggy. Told the waitress lady and she said that's how the dish is and we should just eat it. We are korean so we know when this dish is off. Never will go back again!"}
{"text":"Great service. Good food. Quick, considering how busy they are.  Portion size was decent for the price.  Had the bulgogi.  Appetizers were good."}
{"text":"I was going to give this place 2* because I have had better but it seemed a little harsh considering the food was alright, just not as good as some of the more standard Korean BBQ houses (run by Koreans, that is).  I brought two friends here a couple of nights ago due to our cravings for Korean BBQ. I normally go to Seoul House on Steeles (which I think is still one of the best places for KBBQ) but a friend suggested I try Piggy's if we were to have samgyupsal (or in this case, ogyupsal). Apparently Piggy's is a chain from Korea, and with a name like that,  it seemed a fitting option for pork BBQ. I read a few reviews just to be sure, but ended up going anyhow as I needed to see for myself...  When ordering BBQ, typically you have to get a minimum of two orders per meat, but because there were three of us, we ended up getting two orders of ogyupsal ($16 each) and one bibim naengmyun + LA galbi ($17) for variety's sake. I'd been to Piggy's before and had the latter, so I knew that their LA galbi is really good, but this time it was really fatty and undercooked (but still tasty!). I'm not a medium-rare kinda girl but this was OK. The LA galbi meat is quite tender and in this case, was moreso due to all the fat. It didn't make sense to send it back to cook more as it probably would've come back out too late. The ogyupsal was decent but cooked way too quickly and I didn't like that no coals were used--just a flat iron griddle. The heat distribution was pretty lousy so that one half of the pork strips would sizzle and char away while the other half was still almost raw so it took some shifting around of the meat pieces to get everything cooked properly. There was some kind of seasoning brushed onto the pork strips (three thick pieces per order), including bay leaves! What it was I couldn't say as the flavour was lacking. The ssam lettuce was kind of lifeless and maybe a handful of leaves were brought out so I had to ask for more before we got down to business, along with perilla leaves (not the freshest that night) which are the best with pork ssam! Anyhow, it was just OK.  What I found odd but is seemingly becoming slightly more common these days was that you had to order rice separately ($1.50 for steamed rice - white or purple/black) whereas it's usually included with BBQ. In Korea, it would be considered an insult to expect customers to pay for things like rice or kimchi, but I guess not so much here. If you order rice, they bring you a small hot stone bowl of jjigae which I couldn't really tell what it was. I think it was supposed to be miso (dwenjang) but it was way to salty and spicy (with a layer of grease on top) to be able to discern. That was a fail. At the end of the meal, they served soojunggwa (chilled cinnamon ginger tea -- good for digestion) in these tiny little sauce dishes which helped to get rid of the grease lining the inside of my mouth! A little more would've done the trick...  What I liked about Piggy's the first time I went was the banchan, and was part of the draw for going back the other night. They had a number of items I'd not seen in other Korean restaurants, like the mashed squash, and this time there was an iceberg salad with this wicked black sesame dressing -- so yum! The kimchi they brought to the table was older, aged kimchi which is not for everyone, unless you're an old Korean person!  We were there during peak dinner time. The place was pretty much packed and everyone was having BBQ, quite a few with soju. There were many tables of Koreans, young and old, a couple of tables of old Chinese ladies, some younger non-Koreans--in other words, a real mixed bag, but all having a ball it seemed. Service was very prompt and attentive considering how busy it was. Staff were quick to bring us whatever we needed. I found the prices to be a bit higher than other Korean BBQ houses, and I'm not sure it's totally worth it given some of the other choices in that area. I know I'll be back at Piggy's eventually, but definitely not for table grilling."}
{"text":"The Good: Service here is AMAZING.  Everyone is incredibly friendly, diligent, and, most surprisingly, available.  If you so much as glance up from your table, a nearby staff member will notice and run over to ask if there's anything that you need.  What stands out the most about Piggy's, other than its 5-star customer service, is that they grill the food for you, not just at the beginning, but continuously throughout your meal. Pick a few meats (we got a lot of pork: pork belly, pork shoulder, etc.) and a hearty dish to split with your friends (we got bibimbap) and you'll get a nice taste of everything.  The side dishes are also abundant and mouthwatering; my favourite is the salad with their house-made poppyseed dressing. Couldn't get enough of it!  The Bad: Piggy's is a little bit more on the pricy side for korean fare/bbq (especially since it's not all you can eat.) However, the servings are more than generous and   The Ugly: Nada."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner and was glad we made a reservation.  The restaurant was packed at 6pm.  It's not hard to find but parking is limited.    Food:  Most of the side dishes were spicy so I didn't have much of those.  Ordered the cold noodles.  It seemed a bit peculiar but actually tasted very refreshing.  The waiter taught us to add mustard and vinegar to the dish to taste and it was a good suggestion.  Flavour was enhanced.  However, still not my type but worth trying.  Also ordered the marinated pork belly, marinated beef and it was delicious.  It was served with garlic and lettuce for you to wrap the meat and enjoy.  We also had the seafood pancake which was good but portion was a bit small.  I was a bit disappointed with the dumplings.  They looked great and were huge but a bit bland.  Also had another type of ribs and rice dish (forgot name, see pic), those were delicious too.  Overall, most items are well done.    Service & Atmosphere:  Service was good.  The waiters were attentive and helped us grill the meats and taught us how to eat the cold noodles.  There was a bell on the side of the table for us to call for service when necessary.  Even when there was a huge crowd waiting, they did not rush us which was considerate.  Overall, a very busy but happy atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times but finally taking the time to write a review.  Probably because my most recent experience was so damn good.  Anytime I've been here it's for lunch on a weekday.  The place isn't packed but people are clearly making a point of coming here for lunch as it was busy.  Looks like a great place for table cooking but I'm all about the Pork Bone Soup, also known as Gamja Tang.  For me, the key to a great gamja tang is the broth.  It has to be \"deep.\"  It has to be spicy in my mouth but not like a pepper burning my lips or tongue.  Good quantity of bones (and therefore meat) is important, as is the temperature.  This is, too this point, the best gamja tang I've had in Toronto.  There used to be some good spots for authentic soup on Bloor West but as far as I can tell those days are over.  You gotta go north now to eat the food of discerning Koreans.  Honestly, the first little sip of hot broth and I know I'm hooked.  Their side dishes are fresh and tasty.  Service is attentive.  Atmosphere is just \"whatever\" but I'm really there for the food so I don't care about that.    I'm willing to bet that almost everything on the menu is delicious.  Odds are, I'll be getting the gamja tang every time.  Can not wait to go back."}
{"text":"Will not go back.  The food was average but very disappointed with the garlic beef ( don't waste your $ on this. It was $66 and the beef  was so tough:(   We also ordered the traditional pork belly but it was nothing to rave about.  Definitely have had better.  Pork bome soup, rice with eggs and cheese, dumplings were ok.   There were 5 of us and we were squeezed into a table that was not able to accommodate half of the food we ordered.  They need to take this into consideration since the side dishes took up alot the table space already so our table was at most should be for 3-4 ppl. To top it off, there was cold air blasting  from our overhead vent so we had to keep our coats on while eating bc it was so cold!!!  It was such an uncomfortable dining experience that we couldn't wait to finish and get out.  Nope can't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Go here during weekdays. Wait time is really long on the weekends. Food was okay but their service is soo slow. But this was not their servers' faults because considering the amount of ppl coming in, they really need to hire more servers. I felt so bad for them."}
{"text":"We ordered the five layer pork belly at Piggy's and it came with a LOT of side dishes. The restaurant gets pretty busy around dinner time so keep that in mind when you're planning your visit there! You don't need to order a whole lot there because one order each will be plentiful. it comes with rice and the soup as well so it's a really good deal. The best thing about korean barbeque is that you can control how well done your meat is. Pork should obviously be cooked well but if you like it a bit crispier, you can leave it on a grill for a little bit longer.  The service was average, employees were not super attentive and especially at peak times, you probably won't get everything in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Happened to get invited here for a good Korean meal as an out-of-towner\".  The place was well decorated, and quite busy on a Saturday night.  Definitely a place to call ahead to make a reservation, if you plan on going with a larger group.  Was able to try the \"mul naeng myun\", which was the buckwheat cold noodle soup.  The noodles were cooked to perfection, meaning that they were a nice, chewy texture.  The cold broth was a bit sweet, but icy cold, which made the noodles taste even better.   The \"soon du boo jigae\" was majorly spicy. but still delicious. The broth was well seasoned, but I had to pass off this spicy jigae to someone else, because it was too spicy for my palate.  I've had better versions of this in NY, so I can't say that I was too impressed with this dish.  The steamed \"mandoo\" (homemade dumplings\" was made with veggies and tofu predominantly.  They could've used a bit more seasoning in the filling.  What made these dumplings taste better was the soy sauce it was served with.  I'm not sure this would be a first choice for me if I was craving Korean, because it was just okay for me."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Piggy's Restaurant Cuisine: Korean Location: Thornhill Address: 5 Glen Cameron Rd Price Range: $10~15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4  Service: 2  Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3  Extra information:  * Open for lunch and dinner * Soju Combo avail * Korean BBQ  t about Piggy's Restaurant on twitter when one of the people I follow uploaded a photo of their BBQ meats. You know I love my meats, so I couldn't wait to check out this place.  Piggy's Restaurant is located on Yonge street past Steeles hidden inside a plaza that also has Korean supermarket. The restaurant itself it quite big and spacious, with lots of tables just for regular eats or BBQ depending on whatever you prefer.  They gave us couple side dishes, but I never really pay attention to them- I did like the pickled cucumbers though.  Ordered: Pork Belly BBQ  * 2 orders of pork belly BBQ, minimum 2 orders and each serving is $15.95 * Once the meat comes, they will do the cooking for you * You know how pork belly is, it's fatty and it's delicious * Fat from the pork belly will get everywhere and trust me, you will smell like pork belly after this meal * Pork belly is slightly marinated with greentea leaves as well as basil * Make Ssam (wrap) with the vegetables or eat it with the condiments (ssamjang or kimchi) * Did you know what pork belly is good for your skin? * At least for me that is, everytime I have pork belly BBQ- my skin glows the next day  Ordered: Mak Chang BBQ  * Large intestine BBQ, minimum 2 orders and each serving is $15.95 * This is probably something that not many people are familiar with * Asians love intestines! It's super chewy and I love it * If you order this, they will also cook it for you * This is to be cooked until it's somewhat crispy and eaten with their special spicy sauce * Perfect for pairing with Soju!  Ordered: Bowl of Rice + Daen Jang Jji Gae 4/5  * When you order a bowl of rice, it comes with Daen Jang Jji Gae for $1.50 * Daen Jang Jji Gae was decent with lots of vegetables * Soup was smaller in portion but worth it for $1.50 that you pay for the rice  Ordered: Naeng Myun + Mandoo Combo 5/5  * Bowl of Naeng Myun (cold noodles) and ManDoo (dumpling) combo for $16.95 * Noodles for their Naeng Myun is made in house and very chewy * I tried the spicy Naeng Myun the first time I went and I didn't really like the sauce * Broth for cold noodle soup comes very cold and is refreshing * Def a good way to end your meal after a greasy BBQ * I didn't expect much from the ManDoo (dumpling) but it was so good * It has pork filling inside and is steamed * Dumpling skin was very thin which is the proper way to make Korean dumplings * This is probably one of the best Korean dumplings I had in Canada * I would def recommend this combo!!  Summary: I've been back couple more times after this visit. Although they have a bell you can press for service at your tables, service isn't that great at the restaurant. If pressing the bell doesn't work, you just have to be asian and wave your arms in the air (don't be shy!). I haven't tried any of their beef BBQ, but so far every food I tried from this restaurant has been pretty awesome. If I want porkbelly, I am going to Piggy's Restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Their side dishes are unique. They had ice burg salad with black sesame dressing. The pork belly with kimchi was thick and very filling. New favourite Korean bbq place."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner. Had their BBQ pork shoulder and BBQ duck breast. Both were very good, the meat was tender and fresh. Only downside is you have to order 2 orders for your initial order. But overall the food was excellent, the side items were delicious. Especially the house made sesame dressing for their salad, it was amazing. It could be the reason I come back here again."}
{"text":"We got the thinly sliced pork belly combo....not worth it. $50 comes with a choice of steamed egg or soybean paste soup and soju /4 beers /rice wine. We chose the soybean soup (It was EXTREMELY SMALL) and bottle of soju. Doesn't come with rice and have to order it separately (rice are usually free and again it's a SMALL bowl of rice). Nothing special about this place. Menu is overpriced and not worth it. Wasn't even full after eating. This restaurant is so cheap with their portions. There are better places than here. Definitely never coming back."}
{"text":"I decided one evening to eat dinner at Piggy's since it's so raved about and highly recommended by my friends. I remember visiting Piggy's when I was younger and the interior looks completely redesigned and modern in contrast to how it was back then. The food was definitely overpriced for what it was. We ordered the garlic marinade pork chop for table cooking which came with lettuce wraps and a complimentary dwengjang jjigae (soybean paste soup). We found the meat portion to be a bit small for the two of us. Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Piggy's. Their downtown Spadina store has great bbq and other dishes.  The Thornhill location has great soup dishes, bibimbaps, and seafood pancakes. The variety of banchan offerings are impressive, and they rotate daily.  I found it weird that when I came Saturday for lunch, I was told they were sold out of jehyookbokeeum, spicy pork. However if it was available in bibimbap bowls, yet not as an entree like usual. When I ordered the bowl, it came with tons of spicy pork, making me wonder why I could not order ala-carte like usual.  Anyways, 4 stars for service and food quality. NOTE: The lunch special soup portions are very small and not worth the value."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best kbbq places in Toronto. The meat is well marinated, very juicy, and very tender. The price point is a little higher than other places, but they use the best ingredients and they have a lot of side dishes!  The presentation UFO fried rice is super cool, but the portion is a little small given its price. It's basically just fried rice surrounded by steamed egg.   The cold noodles are not the best. I wouldn't recommend it at all. The noodles are way too thick and chewy and the broth is super sour.  The dumpling hotpot for 2 is huge. The dumplings were a little overcooked. The skins of the dumplings were all falling off. There's supposed to be 6 dumplings, but there were only 5 in the pot. We had to ask them for the last dumpling.   There are usually very long wait times on the weekends. Their online system is very bad. It doesn't refresh at all. One time we waited half an hour outside and half an hour inside. Good thing we spent the last half hour inside because throughout the entire wait the system did not update. Even after the meal the status was still the same as before."}
{"text":"Nothing really stood out except for the cute pig logo on the restaurant's banner.   The service was slow since the place was packed. (Not sure if it's due to the Groupon deal offered)   The meat was pretty dry and lacking in sauce.   Extremely noisy and poor ventilation system.   Nope, won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Piggy's after their renovation. It looks very nice inside and doesn't smell too much like kbbq. The ventilation system is much better. We ordered 2 servings of their traditional pork belly and 2 servings of their garlic beef. The food was delicious, but honestly it's on the pricy side. It comes with 2 stews, 1 pancake and unlimited veggies. You actually have to pay for rice, but the veggies refills are unlimited. I would recommend maybe visiting a kbbq place if you want more meat. Don't get me wrong, the food is great but I just don't find the value in the amount of food we got vs. The amount of money we spent. We ended up paying $35 a person and that's the similar to what we would pay for AYCE."}
{"text":"Piggy's is definitely my favourite restaurant of all time for KBBQ. I'm very picky when it comes to Korean food but I honestly have to say that the KBBQ at Piggy's is amazing. It is on the pricier side (compared to some other KBBQ places like Chako's) but it's definitely worth the money. Your order also comes with a variety of side dishes. On the whole, the side dishes are average - not bad but not exceptional either. Piggy's offers a lot of items other than KBBQ such as Bosam, Pork Cutlet and Pork Bone Soup. One tip: don't get the Cold Noodles; they were awful. I've also tried the Pork Cutlet and loved it.   The service is great but there is usually a long wait to get seated for dinner (anywhere from 10-45min). I recommend avoiding the dinner rush that starts around 6-7pm and coming in for a late lunch/early dinner if you want a table right away. The booths give you quite a bit of privacy but the loud atmosphere isn't ideal if you want to carry on long conversations with friends.   Overall, if you're looking to try some delicious authentic KBBQ, Piggy's is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Good service, great options on the menu, great side dishes, the actual food can be better.   My friends and I all ordered from the lunch option. I had the acorn jelly with veggies and a side of miso stew ($10.99?). Friend got LA kalbi with a side of miso stew ($15.99?) Another friend got spicy pork ($9.99?). I didn't eat my rice so I guess I could've asked them for more veggies instead of the rice. Friend said kalbi was not so tender. She had hard time eating it. I tasted spicy pork and it was perfect for her because she can't handle spice, but I would've wanted it much more spicy.   Servers were very attentive even though the restaurant was packed and there was a line-up!"}
{"text":"I loved this place for all their side dishes it came with for our meal. We got the pork bone soup and the pork belly BBQ and all of it tasted great. Only 4 stars because the line up was too long and there was no greeter at the door to let us know that we need to mark down our names on a piece of paper for a table.   After 30 mins of waiting for a table, we ordered our food and it came quick with all the side dishes but they forgot to bring us the lettuce for our wraps."}
{"text":"I used to come here once in a while before it renovated and was always satisfied with the quality and service. This was the first time I've visited since renovation and was surprised at how nice the place looked. Much roomier and less stuffy.  In terms of food, we ordered two servings of pork belly and two servings of garlic marinated pork for two people. The menu says \"all barbecue items come with rice and soybean soup\" but when I asked about the rice, they told me I had to pay for white rice  (which would then come with soup). Okay fine, no problem it was only $2 but why write that it came with the barbecue on the menu then?  The meat was fine, quality stayed the same to be honest. All the side dishes were fresh and came with plenty of vegetables. I say \"fine\" but I definitely do NOT think it's worth the $38 price.  Service was okay throughout the meal and I didn't have to wait too long to get their attention. The only really disappointing thing was when I paid. The owner did visit our table during our meal and asked if things were good; he was very friendly and nice. But when I paid, he was watching me cautiously to see how much I tipped? For a party of only two, I think it's reasonable to pay 10% tips instead of 15%? If you've visited Piggy's before or read the reviews, you'll probably notice about everyone complaining about the lack of servicing. A server did help us grill our meat but that didn't warrant a huge tip. I swear to you all the owner's attitude flipped 180 degrees after I pressed the 10% tips. He just shoved my receipt at me and didn't even say thank you. In fact, no one said thank you when we left. I'm not sure if Korean manners matter as much in Canada but he didn't even touch his right elbow when he passed me the receipt, which made me think that he was seriously pissed off?  For the two orders of meat and one bowl of rice I paid $78 plus tax plus $9 in tips... I don't think I'll be returning again. Not to a restaurant that makes me feel bad about reasonably tipping anyway."}
{"text":"Piggy's is my go-to restaurant for Korean BBQ. I think they serve some of the best Korean BBQ in town. The only downside is that there is a usually long line-up. So plan your visit time to reduce the waiting. I would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Must Try: Pork Belly, Signature Pork Belly, Galbi, Octopus Fondue,   Rating: (10/10) Food, (1/10) Service, (8/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (8/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness  My Experience:  Was previously a huge fan of Piggy's, having it as my #1 Korean BBQ spot in the GTA, and have been going for years. However, since Piggy's has renovated, the service has drastically declined. I will attest that the quality of meat has maintained or even improved, but the service has gone completely 180.  Immediately following their renovation, as a much deprived Piggy's customer, we made our way there as soon as it reopened. The seating area was much nicer, with improved ventilation and lighting. The menu as similar to before, and the quality of meat was great. The service, not so much so.  Although there was a lot of workers, it was a mission to flag someone down to take orders. Even when we did, several times they would tell us they're coming back (which they never did). The staff was more concerned with cleaning empty tables, than to take our order. After our order was placed, parts of our order were missing, and we had to ask several times to check on the missing pieces. The only thing that was quick was serving us with the bill once we were almost done our meal.    And all this happened on multiple visits to Piggy's. We had given the benefit of the doubt the first time we returned, but a couple more visits and we were faced with the same staff problems.   I'm fairly easy going, and I am very reasonable with regards to service at restaurants, but this was embarrassing. Hopefully they improve their service, so that the experience will be much more smooth.  I will reiterate that the quality food, (meat, dishes, etc) was top notch. The meal itself would easily earn then five stars. The quality of service is really what drops the rating down, as I would give zero stars for the staff."}
{"text":"A great BBQ place to go to with friends or family!  It has  - great food (especially the side dishes)  - fast service  - friendly staff"}
{"text":"Always enjoy and have a craving for authentic Korean BBQ. It's so different from AYCE and the quality. Even though it's pricier but definitely worth the experience. Ambience is casual and loud.  Ordered three portions of the garlic beef to share amongst four of us. It was a good portion plus all the side dishes that came with the meal, we were all so full. Side dishes includes lotus root, tendon, kimchi, spicy and non spicy lettuce, plain lettuce wrap, cucumbers, and pancake (dishes may vary). All the side dishes were refillable except the pancake which cost $2.50 for additional order.   The style of BBQ is unique and different because you will be having more premium meat dipped in the onion sauce they provide and wrap it in the plain lettuce. If you want, you can layer side dishes toppings in it too. I love it!   If you haven't tried authentic Korean BBQ before, definitely give it a try at least once. Piggy's is one of the more popular places in the area. There's this other one I really like too but not gonna mention it here as it has no relevant to this review."}
{"text":"Piggy's is a great place to go for authentic Korean food.   I have had the barbecue and the cuts of meat are great! I would definitely recommend the pork belly. The other food like soups and noodles have do not disappoint either.   I have sat outside in a little deck area that can be nice in the summer time.   The place does get crowded which can attribute to the service being affected. Overall I find their  service friendly but not the most attentive. I make good use of the service button here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It was recommended to me by one of my Korean friends and boy was she right!   No more going to fake downtown Korean spots, this is my new go-to. The food is extremely good and the service is fast. Their beef ribs are awesome and so is the duck for the grill. The pancake is the yummiest I've ever had and I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"The Korean style marinated Pork and Beef tasted very good in BBQ. The flavour was delicious and Asian. They went so well wrapped in lettuce with the house made sauce. Even the small dishes were not bad at all. My brother ordered extra small dishes.   On the side, we ordered a UFO fried rice. This is basically fried rice with fried shrimps placed in the centre of the plate with steamed eggs all around the rice. It's filling and it's a good dish to partner with the BBQ meat.   Besides, we ordered a seafood pancake. I could taste a lot of squids and veggies in the pancake but overall, the pancake needs a  bit flavour.  I like the BBQ meat a lot and will certainly come back for that"}
{"text":"Wanted something quick to eat before we headed to The Cups and we were debating between Home of Hot Taste or this. It's clear which one we chose and I'm glad we did.   I've never been here before, but I've heard great things. Although I should've gotten the pork belly wraps, I just wasn't in a mood for them so I went with the classic pork bone soup instead. I've been craving it for a damn while. My friend got the bulgogi soup and it got a little bit too sweet after awhile, but it was tasty nonetheless. We shared the spicy pork bibimbap and I definitely would've preferred the more traditional one instead.   The service was great. Friendly and fast is all I need. The decor is nice and it's quite spacious inside.   Piggy's Restaurant satisfied my cravings."}
{"text":"Tasty korean bbq that is super filling. Had the Dae Ji Gal Bi- Korean style marinated pork rib and the flavour was really good. We actually ordered the seafood pancake as well, but just ordering the pork dish definitely would have been more than enough (there was only two of us). Ended up taking most of the pancake to go."}
{"text":"Ordered the samgyupsal, and the galbi;  The galbi was my favourite - melts in your mouth.  The grill was too hot and it cooked the meat faster than I liked, and oil was kind of burning us in the process, but the service was friendly enough to help us along, even in putting/flipping the meat for us on occasion.  The restaurant is a little dark, and could do with improved ambience, but I think the popularity really comes from the food, and great side dishes.  Would've liked to see a bit more meat for the price, but in the end, had a very satisfying meal."}
{"text":"4.5 is the real rating   We've been to this place 3 times. Each time we've tried something new, we've discovered some very delicious finds and some not so great finds.   The reason we're not rating this place a solid 5 stars is because last time we went the service wasn't on point like the first 2 times. Unfortunately we were seated in hidden corner and weren't tended to like before. But enough about the downs, the first two times they were super attentive, checking up on our meat, cooking and cutting it for us and each time we were cooking a different meat our grill was replaced. Mind you we go to Korean BBQ every week so we know how to cook it but its nice with the unnis ajumas and oppas come and do it for us. Overall they are very nice and answer your questions, a lot of Korean places aren't that friendly if you're not Korean.   The food at this place is amazing! We've order a bunch of pork dishes and beef. Overall I find the pork the best and most consistent. We ordered dumplings once but they weren't that special. The ban Chan (side dishes) are amazing and are always fresh! Korean BBQ just isn't the same without the side dishes. They also give you this delicious plum juice at the end which we ended up buying for our home because of how much we liked it."}
{"text":"i love this place and i love that it is only a 5 minute walk from my apartment :) both the food and service is great here and the prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place since it's Korean BBQ (not all you can eat).  I had the Dae Ji Gal Bi (Korean-style marinated pork rib) for 2 person portion. The pork ribs were really good, it was well marinated (with mostly green onion, garlic, green pepper).  You have to eat it a bit quick though, cause if the meat is cooked a bit too long - it does get pretty hard to chew on.  I got this meal with a combo - so I had rice, soup and a lot of side dishes.  The side dishes didn't disappoint.  I particularly enjoyed the pink sour radish pieces.  It's sour so it opens up your appetite before eating the meat.  The broccoli and the salad is also good.  I also like how there is a mini pancake for you - at some places that's considered a dish!  Service is good as well.  Some Korean restaurants have rude staff and limited English.  But here, their English is great and they kindly cook the meat for you and they automatically change the BBQ stove top when it's a black and filled with charcoal.    I noticed a lot of Korean celebrities went here before (like Brian Joo, G.NA) - so this place is a little bit more touristy, which makes it understandable how they have a lot of English speaking staff.   I would try again with other friends so we can try more dishes besides the BBQ."}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ in North york in my opinion. I grew up in Markham with tons of cheap Korean bbq joints that don't hold up against piggy's! Having travelled to Korea last year over the summer I have to double down that it's one of the best spots in north york with a very authentic taste and menu to what you would find in Korea. The service is quick and polite, very easy to get what you need with a button to call your server. The best thing about piggy's is the unlimited side dishes that is common with Korean restaurants. I like to get the thick 3 layer cut bacon and then keep the side dishes coming with delicious garlic, kimchi and salad. Each table has its own exhaust fan so it doesn't get too Smokey but occasionally can get a little cool in the restaurant with all the air flow. Also have had some great stews and soups that all taste authentic and delicious! Definitely worth a trip if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This is my first experience at a kbbq that was NOT run by Chinese people so I was very excited. Bonus star for cleanliness, since dirty restaurants are a major pet peeve. They have earned this cleanliness star b/c I saw them cleaning up my table before I sat down and the amount of effort that they put it was astounding. Chinese places would merely wipe the table top, but here they wiped down the table, grill, AND the seats! Speaking of the seats though, the banquettes aren't very ergonomic and tall people (luckily I'm not one of them) may be quite uncomfortable.  For the food portion we got 2 orders of samgyeopsal, and each portion is about $14. Sounds expensive but keep in mind that it comes with a healthy portion of banchans (which we didn't finish) and if you order rice it also comes with a mini kimchi chigae which I thought was a nice touch. We also ordered a \"dessert\" nengmyun afterwards, which isn't anything sweet, its just something to cleanse the palette after a greasy meal. Overall I enjoyed the food. Bear in mind that the samgyeopsal isn't marinated, so it's best to dip it in a sauce or make a wrap with the lettuce that comes with it. I enjoyed the fact that I can finally enjoy kbbq without dying from thirst afterwards. I wasn't crazy about the salad that came as a banchan though cause the dressing was too sweet for me. But overall, good way to get a nice filling meal in the winter.  Service wise, they use that bell thing, which I appreciate b/c I hate when I either can't flag down a server when I need one, or when they keep interrupting my conversation to check how I'm doing, so the bell solves both issues. When ever I did ring the bell the server popped up pretty much right away which was also awesome.  Overall I enjoyed my experience here and would likely return if I have the chance.Also, it might interest kpop fans to know that A Pink and Teen Top visited here. They even signed the wall ;) ."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here, but I don't think I will be returning. Compared to other Korean BBQ places, Piggy's is just not up to par anymore with quality especially in regards to their prices.   My partner and I arrived at approximately 9pm on Friday and looked at the menu during our wait to save time since we were both extremely hungry.  We were seated at around 9:30pm.  The younger employees seemed to care little about service and was constantly in a rush for something...however found time to chit chat with eachother. We weren't brought the menus so decided to call service (via button) after 10 minutes of waiting to just order. Someone came and said \"hold on a moment\", rushed off, and after about 5 minutes came back with menus and left promptly again before we could say anything. Thinking there may be a language barrier, we called service again and ordered while pointing at the menu items.  We got the marinated rib fingers (described as bite size and melts in your mouth) and a seafood soon tofu (silky tofu).  When the beef came, I noticed how big and unevenly cut the pieces were as the server placed half the portion onto the grill. Due to its large size, we decided to cut it some more with the scissors provided. It was a challenge to cut through this meat. Cutting was so difficult already...you could imagine how hard we had to chew or how much we swallowed whole.  No where near \"melts in your mouth\"!   The soon tofu came halfway through our meal with a side of rice but missing the egg on the side. I asked about it and the server apologized sincerely and quickly brought it. The tofu's texture was \"older\" than other soon tofus I have had but the flavour was still good. About to eat my second spoon of rice, I see a little beetle like bug resting in the rice. I was a little disturbed but scooped it out and continued my meal.   Last call occured around 10pm, which I found strange since they supposedly close at 12am. We asked to get more kimchi and lettuce around 10:15. The server stacked some unfinished side dishes along with the empty kimchi plate and took it away without asking. She then came back a few minutes later to tell us the kitchen is closed already. I didn't know kimchi required cooking...but providing our first and only refill request could not be done.   I've been gradually more disappointed with this place time after time...but this time has done it for me. We paid $80 or so for this meal and experience. No more Piggy's for me!"}
{"text":"The décor of the restaurant has become impressive ever since the renovation. The inside of the restaurant is brighter and the smell of the KBBQ is less intensive with the installation of the new fans and lighting.   Now, the décor wouldn't matter if the food was bad but I can honestly say that their food is above average for their prepared meals. We have not tried their KBBQ so I can't review that aspect of the restaurant but in my 2 visits since the renovation, the Pork Bone Soup and the Donkatsu has been very good choices. I was particularly surprised with the pork katsu since it was so flavourful and moist. Also the pork had the right  amount of breading. One of the better Donkatsu that I had in a Korean restaurant. It might be even better than Cho Sun Ok. Also they offer different variation of the Pork Bone soup with different ingredients of your choosing. Something to consider instead of just having a one standard version like in other restaurants. Their selection of banchan is very good and generous. They do not skimp out  on their selection although their kimchi could be better.   In regards to service, I'm surprised to hear that other reviewers have found them lacking. In all of my previous experiences in this restaurant, which has not been documented previous to the renovation, lack of service was not something that we felt it was needed here. On our recent visits, the service was attentive and prompt when ringing the bell and also the speed of the food was fairly fast. Maybe we have just been lucky.  This is a very strong alternative place for Korean food when the other Korean restaurants in the area are closed or you just need to try something new.  P.S. You get a free pop if you check in with Yelp in this restaurant.  Recommended"}
{"text":"It's kind of a typical Korean restaurant, just bigger and cost a tad more than the usual Korean meal. Flavour-wise, it taste similar to any other Korean restaurant near Yonge and finch! This location is much bigger and good for larger groups. They have separate grilling tables for BBQ which can make the table space tight especially with the additional side dishes! All in all, it's an alright Korean restaurant. Mainly known for their BBQ. *I'm a Korean and I've tried better at other locations (personal opinion)"}
{"text":"Piggy. Is. Yummy.  Need I say more?!?  Decided to go for some Korean food and ended up taking a suggestion from a friend.  The location is quite easy to find and has its own parking! (Blessed). The restaurant itself was also larger than I expected, so it was nice to see that it was bustling on a Monday night! This location has a mix if KBBQ and cooked dishes, making this a perfect location for any of your Korean food needs.   My friend and I decided to go for the Bossam Dinner Combo, which came with tons of pork, radish, lettuce, and tofu for the wraps. The combo also included Steamed Egg with Veggies and a bottle Soju. Amazing amount of food and for a good price too! The Bossam was amazing, cooked to perfection, and was perfectly paired with all the side dishes it came with!  The service was amazing as well. Our main server was super nice with a great smile, and explained certain things about the menu we didn't quite get. The table also had a service bell which would easily and quickly alert a server. They never took their time, and always went to see what was needed straight away!  Piggy. Is. Great! I will definitely be back for more! Kamsamnida!"}
{"text":"Having been coming to Piggy's for a few years, I can say that the food is consistently great and with the unlimited refills of side dishes, we always leave on a full stomach. The servers are also very nice and its an added bonus that they come around and help you grill the meat. My personal favourite here is the oogyupsal (pork belly). If you're craving kbbq, this is definitely a step up from the \"all you can eat\" kbbq joints."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and had different experiences. The first time we had the pork belly....nothing great. The next time we had the beef which was cooked on the charcoal grill and also had the korean pancake and found that meal life changing. The beef was so tender and the pancake was cooked to perfection. Then we came back and tried the beef again and the pancake -- this time though we were disappointed. The beef was tough and the pancake wasn't cooked through. Then we came back again and same thing, not as good as the first time we had the beef....I always wonder what kind of beef we had the first time around and wish that it could be the same every time...same with the pancake, more consistency in terms of cooking."}
{"text":"This is place is really good for korean bbq.  We got there on a Friday night around 8:30 and waited for about 15 minutes.  This is NOT all you can eat and the prices are on the high side but that is reflected in the quality of the meat you are getting.  We ordered the traditional pork belly for 2 and the boneless beef rib for 1.  Both were really good.    The staff come by and cook the meats for you which I really liked.   We also ordered their beef UFO rice which was tasty but too oily for me. I don't think I will be ordering this again. In addition you get like 5 different side dishes, 2 different salads and a pancake.  Service was excellent.  There is a call button on the table to press whenever you need something and someone is always there within a couple of minutes.  I would definitely come by to try their soup based dishes next time!"}
{"text":"dated decorum, and slow service, or perhaps inadequate service.  we ordered a mix of stuff for a party of people, some grill, some straight menu dishes.  the grill meat was not very good quality meat, a little chewy, fatty, had to dig around for some good pieces. they missed bringing out an order, but since we ate all the other food that was out, didn't follow up with the wait staff.  english is not strong with the employees, so errors happen.  side dishes are nice, but not the reason to go there.  chako barbeque is much nicer, trendier more updated decorum."}
{"text":"Came here on a friends birthday, and tried the Korean BBQ. The food was extremely good and service was good too. Yeah the price is not exactly cheap, but it wasn't expensive either after splitting the bill with a bunch of people. I will for sure come again, and I do recommend anyone else to come try the Korean BBQ. It's really good!"}
{"text":"My first time coming here because my friend looveeeesss this place and their kalbi. I have to admit, their kalbi is really delicious. It is nice and tender with just the right amount of sauce. I used to hate cold noodles but after trying theirs, I am now a cold noodle fan.  Their side dishes is also really good! Staff is friendly and the price is very reasonable. There is also a parking lot available which is a bonus since many Korean restaurants at Finch and yonge only have street parking.   Definitely would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Great service and good vibe.  The food is quite good and the portions are very reasonable.  It is a bit on the pricey side, but worth it.  They help you grill your meat.  Side dishes were also generous and there was no issue getting more.  I would give it 5 stars except for the price."}
{"text":"I dined here twice with my friends. Here's my break down:  Food: 4.5/5 - the appetizers are delicious! I love the sesame mayo salad (?), LOVE the potato salad, pickled radish. Also ordered pork belly - SO good, and the garlic beef - THE BEST. Also, you're supposed to order a minimum of two servings per grill type - so you must order 2 servings minimum, and to order another meat it either must be made on the same grill. If it's made on a different type of grill, you must order a minimum of 2 servings. So for two people dining in... you're looking at a $100 bill as two servings of meat costs $50-80.   Price: On the pricier side. But it's okay for once in a while.   Service: Prompt. The staff on the other hand... 4/5 of them are rude as heck. They come up to your table without saying a word, grab the tongs out of your hand (I was trying to flip my beef on the grill), shake their head and tisk, then proceed to change the grill. A little explanation would have been appreciated. I found that usually the older women are the ones severely lacking in the customer service department and this is a HUGE turn off.   Atmosphere: Spacious, well ventilated.   Would I recommend? Yes for the food. Maybe, if finances are an issue. A definite no if you're looking for more hospitable service."}
{"text":"Herbivores beware! This korean bbq restuarant is all about meat. I would definitely recommend coming here in a big group of friends so that you can try out more types of meats. One of my favorite cut was the pork belly, where you would take the lettuce, add some rice, kimchi, and onions (they all come as side dishes) and roll it into a wrap! Yum!  You may wonder why I am giving this place a 3 star. This has everything to do with the service. After bbq a round of meats, the grill usually becomes blackened and charred. That's when the servers come to your table and switches the grill top with a new one. During the first grill switch, out server was holding a hot grill top drenched with hot oil over our heads. So the second time around, I told him that I will move aside to let him do his job. However, he did not listen and some of the hot oil on the grill top spilled onto my hand. I would definitely recommend that the owners think about how dangerous the grill changes are and perhaps move the grill to the end of the table to allow the servers to change it without holding the hot grill over anybody's head. It was lucky that it was just my hand and not someone else's eyes.  If you do decide to come here for the food, make sure you take caution when they are switching the grills!"}
{"text":"Though the meat at this place was of good quality and flavour, I would never return.  We did tell our waitress that it was our first time there, however she was still rude and unhelpful and sometimes confused by our order. It was way too expensive as we were forced to purchase 2 servings of the same meat. We spent about $160 for our table of 4, and I wasn't even very full when we finished. AND the best part of it all, you can't even taste the smokiness of the charcoal doesn't even touch the meat because of the type of grill Piggy's used.   If you want a legit charcoal BBQ experience, your better off turning on your BBQ at home and save yourself the cash."}
{"text":"Came here twice after my friend brought me to this restaurant. The first time I got the kimchi pork bone soup, a classic that never goes wrong, so it's a good dish to kind of scope out a Korean restaurant. The second time I got the cold noodle and galbi combo, because that's what my friends had and it looked delicious.  The galbi was really really good, and the cold noodle had a huge portion. My personal opinion, I think cold noodles are better in smaller portions instead of being the main course, but nevertheless the cold noodles were really good. However, I put too much of the sauce in my soup so it got really spicy (the wasabi kind of spicy), but after adding a bit of water it was okay. I'll most likely be back again and try the other dishes in the future. My friends got the spicy octopus with cheese and corn and eggs (don't remember what it's called exactly), but it looked really good and definitely gonna try it next time with my husband."}
{"text":"Location: 5 Glen Cameron Road Unit 27 (Thornhill, ON L3T 5W2) Price: $$-$$$ Service: Fast and nice   I have drove by this place no many times and I was finally able to have dinner here! It was an exciting night. It is in the same plaza as the Nino D'aversa bakery along Yonge street.   I usually go all you can eat KBBQ, so this was delightful. When you go, I recommend to bring along body spray, since your clothes will soak up all the steam from the food. I went with two other friends and we ordered 1 order of samgyeopsal (pork bell), which feeds around two people or so. BUT, there were three of us so we also ordered the Korean pancakes. There were definitely enough food with those two dishes we ordered. The order comes with side dishes as well. The Korean pancakse were filling cause it was really thick- personally I would of liked it thinner. The samgyeopsal also comes with two small bean paste soup.  Personally, I liked this place a lot and would go back. I gave it a rating 3/5 is because I haven't tried other dishes on the menu yet.  Verdict: I'll be BACK"}
{"text":"Came around 2 PM for a late lunch. It was not very busy at the time.  We opted not to get their BBQ and went with the large pork bone soup in a hot pot and a pancake.  The pancake tastes good, but the pork bone soup despite the size of the pot, came with pretty much 4 or 5 pieces of meat and not much of anything else. Granted, at that point I realized what they meant by \"adding extras\" to the pot: it literally means you will get pork bone and soup if you don't. Maybe 5 or 6 pieces of rice cakes.  Now, yelp review mentions good or excellent service. Unless \"great service\" means they take your order and bring you side-dishes and your dishes (aka doing their job without looking annoyed), it was pretty terrible for a restaurant with only a few tables of customers at the time. There were waitresses coming and going to bring dishes, but none of them asked if we wanted refills on the side-dishes, or any other things you would expect of service. When we pressed the bell on the table, no one came either until we pressed it a few times; only then did someone come 5 minutes later.  Perhaps if we had ordered BBQ, we might have received better service. You know, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"One of my fave Korean bbq places. The place got a reno meaning they changed up the decor as well as menu boosting the priced. Because previously I remember having a great combo which came with drinks and a soup but that is no longer in the options.   Went with my family and waited a bit. We sat in a nice and reasonable sized booth which was all the seats in the restaurant. So there weren't any standing alone chairs.  We ordered samgyupsal classic and one marinated in garlic. Both were very tasty!   We also got a cheese rice with egg on hot plate. That was one of the newer things to piggy. It came in a sizzling plate layered with a light coat if cheese and boiled egg on the bottom. The garnishings for sided dishes are things u can ask for refilling. However the pancake is a one time thing. You have to pay after that.   Overall a scrumptious meal truly flavorful."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Piggy's Restaurant. It was really busy due to a recent groupon-type promotion. I have to be honest, it was not nearly as good as my first visit.  I ordered the Kalbi tang (#1 on the menu) for 9.95.  It was a bit simple, a good broth with three pieces of meat.  I was still a bit hungry afterwards, and wish i had ordered the pork bone soup.  We also had the dolsot bibimbap, pork bone soup, and the bulgogi, which were all 8.95.  The bibimbap was ok, but the rice was not quite crispy, leaving the rice a bit soggy.  The bulgogi looked to be the standout, with a big portion of meat, including the purple-rice.  The side dishes were quite different - about 6 including 2 types of kimchi, spinach, a potato pancake, and a pickled dish.  The service was a bit chaotic - as the restaurant was quite busy, and wait staff had to be flagged down to order, for more side dishes, for the bill, etc.  Overall it was just an average experience, and I was a bit disappointed.  I noted afterwards the really large amounts of msg, I get a burning feeling, and wish they would use other ways to develop flavours. However, with the discount, it came out to $30 for 4 people, so it was quite cheap.  For me, I prefer a more relaxed environment."}
{"text":"This place was great. I went here for a friends birthday and the food was delicious.    Don't know the names of the dishes but the pork belly was flavorful and well seasoned.  The seafood pancake was nice and crispy on the outside and the squid was tasty.    Prices are a bit on the higher end but we'll worth it.     Wait staff was very pleasant and knowledgeable offering great suggestions and a great experience.  Would definitely go again to try more of their food."}
{"text":"guuuuuuud korean bbq???pork belly with lettuce and garlic is awsooooome. The cold noodle is spicy goes well with bbq meat"}
{"text":"This piggy had KBBQ, all the way home.  As usual, my boyfriend introduced me to this place (he went out with his coworkers for dinner once) and as usual, I was dreading to go (not a fan of hype places) but this quickly became one of our go-to hotspots for KBBQ, fancy KBBQ. What makes it so fancy is that the restaurant is clean, like very clean, the wait staff are really nice but not like \"I'll check up on you every 5 minutes nice\" like at other fancy eateries, here, they leave you alone except when they cook your food for you, that's right, they literally come with your order of meat, cut it up and start grilling (very cool).  Presentation and Taste: big portions, fresh cuts of lean meat (seasoned and unseasoned depending on the meat that you ordered) and deliciousness all around!  Pros: Consistent, you get your bang for your buck and more!  Cons: The wait times are 20-30 minutes (reservations are recommended because the place is packed 24/7 (till they close)  Price: A dish can feed two people for less than $40, rice is NOT included ($2ish) but you do get A LOT of free sides!  Seconds: YES PLEASE! =D"}
{"text":"We went to piggy on a weekday night as a group of 4 and order Korean marinated beef for the grill (double portion) and pork bone soup hot pot (medium).   The service was average, maybe because they were pretty packed on a weeknight? But they did refill a few of our banchans when we requested it.   In general, the food itself was average at best. Out of the 2 dishes we order, the beef was the better one, decently marinated and it was grilled over charcoal. However, I wouldn't say it is memorable...and it was quite pricey. The pork bone soup was disappointing....we order mild, which was probably part of the reason why it lacked the complex flavour, but the meat actually stuck to the bones!"}
{"text":"Very popular korean bbq place but i dont find anything special. The signature pork belly was tough and the skin had hairs. I prefer the korean bbq that offers corn & cheese and egg."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favourite KBBQ in the GTA but after trying other ones and coming here again I was a little disappointed. We came here as a group of 6 friends for dinner on Saturday. The line to be seated was insane and we ended up waiting for 1 hour. Also they don't take reservations.   Atmosphere: 4/5 - it's really clean and well furnished inside  - they definitely renovated it compared to a few years back  - love the smell of KBBQ - just makes you salivate as soon as you walk in haha   Food: 3.5/5 - from what others have told me they serve premium quality meat but I really can't tell the difference - what I can tell you is that the price is definitely steeper than other authentic KBBQ - pork belly for 2 people is $35 and beef table cooking for 2 is $55  - I expected a lot more food for that price but they don't really give a lot of meat  - I am impressed by their side dishes tho! It filled our table. One of their side dish is this pancake but unfortunately you can't get 2nds for that - the table cooking also came with soup which was decent but not my fav  - we also ordered Albap fried rice which was surprising very good! I would recommend it  Service: 4/5 - aside from the long line up at beginning and being shifted around by the staff I thought the service here was pretty good  - they have a button at each table that you can press to request for service  - food came pretty fast  - despite how busy it was the service was prompt!   Overall its not bad but because of limited parking, the long wait, and the price I wouldn't come here on a frequent basis."}
{"text":"If you love Korean BBQ, you will love this place. The food is fantastic and fresh.  We got the marinated beef ribs, the pork belly, and something else. As always, the appetizer was great. You should get a reservation in weekend as there are a lot of people.  When we went, there weren't a lot of people. Even without a lot of people, service wasn't very good. There was no bell to call the server like other places. We had to wave people down after waiting 15 min for some water/tea  The atmosphere was ok.....just a traditional BBQ place. Nothing special  Overall, would go back for the food, but not the service"}
{"text":"One of the best Korean food in toronto . I've been to most of the Korean restaurant in Toronto .  The service today was great .."}
{"text":"THE WASHROOM: It was clean I must say for an asian restaurant it wasn't that bad didnt really smell either!  THE SERVICE: This is where this restaurant is a little lacking the service wasn't the best although the restaurant was not that busy it still took the server a little while before taking our order and she even forgot our pop! This place would've gotten a 5/5 if the service was better!  THE FOOD: IT WAS GOOD! We made one order of Pork Belly and one order of Pork Butt Shoulder! Grilled to perfection with fresh garlic and lettuce it was hands down the best pork belly ive had in toronto! none of the frozen stuff you get at most korean restaurants! keep in mind I am reviewing the THICK CUT PORK BELLY not the thinly sliced poopoo. very generous with the side dishes, the salad and japchae were amazing.  THE RESTAURANT ITSELF: Standard korean-looking restaurant not fancy at all, was clean didnt have to think twice before walking in.   WOULD I COME AGAIN: Yes I would and I would go out of my way to come back again! T'Was a good experience, thank you vivian for the recommendation."}
{"text":"If you don't like spicy food, you have no business ordering food here.  They also don't tell you which dishes are spicy."}
{"text":"In terms of food quality, this place gets 5/5. However, their prices and service caused me to drop 2 stars. Below is a long review because I'm writing about 3 separate visits in detail.   What made me go to Piggy's is that they were doing groupons. If you follow my reviews, you'll notice that I really love coupons. (And if you follow me enough, it means you're stalking me and it's creepy). I bought a whooping 3 groupons because I really love Korean food.   1st Visit:   This visit impressed my taste buds. We ordered 2 KBBQ beef items. One was the famous Yang Nam Kalbi (), and the other was the boneless beef ribs. I always knew REAL KBBQ (as opposed to the AYCE kind run by Chinese) was expensive. My Korean friends tell me this is approximately how much they charge in Korea as well. So for once, I forgive a restaurant for being pricey.   The menu says that if you order rice, you'll get a soy bean paste soup. This is actually pretty ludicrous because I know at other KBBQ restaurants, any BBQ item would often come with rice and soy bean soup at no extra charge. Soy bean soup is not expensive to produce anyways and all they have to do is scope it from the mass produced container. When the soy bean soup came, I was shocked at how small it is. It fills about half the bowl and I finished it in about 10 spoon scopes and it's a small spoon. The worst part is that even though we ordered 2 servings of KBBQ, they only give us 1 soy bean soup.  Anyways, the beef ended up being very delicious. It's probably the best BBQ beef I've had...ever? My only gripe was that the Yang Nam Kalbi was more or less boneless anyways. (Or I got lucky?) The boneless version of Kal bi seems like a scam at just 200g.   2nd Visit: I should talk about the side dishes now. The side dishes \"look\" better than other Korean restaurants and they taste pretty good. I can tell they use more fresh vegetables in their side dishes. The kimchi is one of the best I've had and I love pumpkin salad. I wish the salad didn't have such MASSIVE chunks of pumpkin. A better mix would have flowed better in my mouth.   I nearly always insist on trying something new so naturally I chose not to order the same KBBQ item. We ordered 1 x Stewed Pork Loin with special house Kimchi and  (Mushrooms & Bulgogi). Yes that's listed as a KBBQ item except it's not because the bulgogi is cooked in a broth.   In terms of taste, the speical house kimchi tasted terrible to me. I beleive there are people that enjoy this kind of taste but I'm certainly not one of them. My bigger gripe was how small this dish is. For $10, all you get is about 5 pieces of pork loins with equally small amounts of kimchi. If you're wondering about the taste, it tastes a little pickled. It's sour.   The house kimchi was a massive disappointment to me. Then my disappointment reached new heights with the bulgogi. The amount of vegetables is so little. I LOVE mushrooms. The portion of bulgogi is also quite small. By the end, we were still hungry. I thought this dish would be more special since they charge $25 for it. Did you know that bulgogi uses the cheapest parts of beef to make? I thought there'd be better ingredients in this dish. The flavor is just regular bulgogi that you can get anywhere. The only saving grace to the meal was the Kimchi fried rice. For $3, it's about the only thing that's worth its price tag on the menu.   3rd visit: It's pretty hard to disappoint me more than the 2nd visit. This time it's better but not by much. We ordered 2 servings of pork ribs + 2x  rice. The label says 350g per serving but I could swear we only got about 500g max. Taste wise it was amazing. Same disappointment with the size of the soy bean soup.   By now I probably sound like a cheap ass because I always mention price. Well...I'm a very price conscious consumer. I like to get my money's worth. I'm happy to pay $50 for a meal if you make it special and exotic. This clearly isn't the case with Piggy's.   The service is not amazing. The 1st visit we got great service. The male staff are young and friendly. The 2nd and 3rd visit we got this lady who was hard to get a hold of. I was also annoyed that when we asked for more side dish (which took 4 rings of the bell), they barely refilled it. They gave maybe 30% of the original side dish portions. I actually don't mind bad service much as it's pretty normal in Asian places. Asians are practical with food and generally care more about the food rather than the atmosphere. I deducted 2 stars purely due to what a rip off this place is with the portions. It's not like they justify the high price with classy atmosphere. The restaurant looks nice but it's not a romantic kind of nice that justifies the prices they charge as per Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"NOTE:  I am only commenting on the herb marinated O-gyeopsal as the other normal samgyeopsal is good but nothing to write about.  See my pic.  By far the absolute best herb marinated o-gyeopsal joint in the GTA!!   Teaching English in Korea allowed me to eat my lion's share of samgyeopsal/o-gyeopsal from all districts of Seoul.  And let me tell you:  these guys serve one hell of a MARINATED o-gyeopsal.  MAKE SURE YOU ORDER THE MARINATED (IN HERBS AND LEMON) o-gyeopsal.  You'll know you got the right one b/c you can see the herbs all over the pork bellies (see the pic I uploaded).  Service is efficient.  There are no dedicated wait staff to sections - wave down whomever is walking by and they will help you.  Yes, there are wireless bells you can push at the tables, but when it gets busy, trust me, it'll be easier to waive down the nearest person around.  Someone here said the samgyeopsal was dry.  If so, it isn't the fault of the restaurant since Korean BBQ puts you in charge of the cooking.  Sure the wait staff will on occasion come by to flip the meat but you can still manage the cooking time/process.  Cook it to your preference, as you like it.    Another testament to its authenticity and delicious o-gyeopsal is that it's full packed of Koreans - new immigrants, 1st gen, 2nd gen, 1.5 gen - you name it they all show up here.  And they bring their Chinese friends who bring their Chinese families and friends.  I myself was introduced to this restaurant by a group of Korean students from Korea who love this place.    WARNING:  this is a samgyeopsal specialty joint, but the real star of this place is the herb marinated o-gyeopsal!!!!  You come here for the pork bellies...ordering anything else is ok, but don't expect the same genius in those dishes as in their o-gyeopsal.  That's not what they are known for...also, this place knows their worth and they charge you accordingly.  In other words, it's pricey compared to other joints that serve samgyeopsal - and to me, that's ok bc the other joints can't produce this level of flavour.  When I want to know if a Chinese restaurant is authentic and good, I ask the Chinese people who grew up eating the food made at home and served at their home town restaurants.  With this restaurant, it came strongly recommended by Koreans and having gone there many times, I can also say it's the real deal and as yummy as I've had in Korea.    I highly recommend it...for the herb marinated o-gyeopsal. ;-)"}
{"text":"I'm a returning customer but my visit to the store yesterday was awful. First of all, as I entered the store there was no greeting. One lady tell us to sit by the window; I was on my way to the seat, all of the sudden one Korean man sat on to that seat so I thought maybe the lady was wrong about that was an empty seat. (I found out that man came after me) So another guy asked me to sit another seat which I did. After 10 mins there was no menu no tea not even a person came to us. So I press the bell on the table, finally one lady came with a menu with an annoyed face.  Then, I ordered the kimchi pork belly which I've ordered it before. The pork belly didn't look the same so I asked the waitress to confirm. She claimed that is the one I ordered but it tasted different.  Probably won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"My first visit here was great. We came around noon and the restaurant was pretty empty so we got seated immediately. Our food came shortly after ordering and our waiter was so nice.  We ordered Saeng Samgyeopsal - pork belly for two people. The pork belly was great and the lettuce wraps and side dishes were unlimited. Our waiter came by periodically to cook and cut the pork belly which was a nice surprise. The only down side is the side dishes were mediocre compared to other Korean restaurants.  We also got the steamed dumplings which were huge in size but just ok. The dipping sauce was better than the dumplings themselves. I wouldn't get it again.  The waiter had asked if it was our first time visiting and since it was, he brought a complimentary Gae Ran Jjim. The steamed egg was delicious. Well seasoned and perfectly cooked - highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been here before and after the recent renovations -- and while the renovations are awesome (modern decor) and the staff works hard, I still think their dishes are somewhat overpriced.    I recently tried a dish of theirs called \"UFO rice\" -- and it was such a disappoint.  It was fried rice with cheese and definitely not worth its price.  Other than that, their tabletop cooking/grilling is good and their side dishes are decent.  One aspect of the restaurant that impressed me was the frequency they would change the grills as you eat -- this was something they did not do before renovations! Thumbs up for that.  Piggy's Restaurant is a decent restaurant, but again, a bit on the pricy side for the quality of food (marinated meats included).  A fun place to go with a few friends, but don't expect to be frivolous!"}
{"text":"We had a feast eating here. The dumplings were huge the size of my Palm. We also ordered the BBQ been slices and the after BBQ cold noodles. Super delicious.  (See photo iv added) ... the only thing that I did not like was their grilled fish. It didn't taste too fresh and was a bit tough to eat. Don't know why it was like that but they heavily marinated it.   One word of advice,if you come on weekends for dinner make sure you call to book a table otherwise expect to wait for hours for a large seat if your party is 6+ people. We come here for the BBQ tables but if you do this you definitely want about 4 or more people to enjoy this with.    And another piece of advice is, DO NOT WEAR NICE CLOTHES HERE because you will leave smelling heavily like BBQ."}
{"text":"Heard that this place underwent massive renovation for a year and was now a hotspot in richmond hill. When we arrived I gave my name and phone number to the guy upfront and text was sent to my phone redirecting me to a website that real-time tracked our group's place in line. Pretty neat. The restaurant was absolutely packed on a friday night (good sign) and we were told it was gonna be a 40 min wait. We figured \"oh what the hell\" and decided to wait it out.   When we got seated I noticed the huge smoke vents above every table to suck up all thay kbbq smoke (check). My group of 3 ordered a kimchi stew, tofu soup, seafood pancake, 2 orders of pork belly, 2 orders of marinated beef and a ufo fried rice.  We got the usual assortment of banchan but we also received some really interesting ones. Aside from reg kimchi, we got a homemade 6 month fermented kimchi which was more sour and delicious. We also got two salads. One salad had a tangy sauce on it the other one had a creamy, poppy seed dressing. The poppy seed dressing was crack. I was dipping my meat in it too.  The kimchi stew and tofu soup were nothing to write home about. Very average dishes that you could get at owl of minerva. The seafood pancake was the best one I've ever had. Packed to the brims with ample fresh seafood.   The pork belly was the real star. Thick cut and soooo succulent. The beef was not bad but if you're gonna pick one protein to try here go for the pork belly. The ufo fried rice was also bomb af. Kimchi fried rice base topped with beef and surrrounded by steamed egg. MMMMM.   The bill came to ~$220 so yea, definitely really pricey place but the food tasted amazing. I'm decreasing my overall rating by a star because of the price, otherwise if purely based on food, I'd prolyl award a 5 star."}
{"text":"Food was good however customer service, communication & eye contact is a zero. Don't expect anyone to check up on you, you'll have to wave someone down. The protein we ordered, although delicious was not what we expected from the picture. We opted to cook at the table. We ordered the #46. I'm surprised because at the price we paid, and at other Korean BBQ establishments, you are given a soup, the egg dish, rice & more toppings. Our meal was abbreviated. We were never offered water, just the hot tea. I asked for a can of soda (pop) and showed them my Yelp coupon from check-in.. It was reluctantly honored but no one was familiar with the coupon I showed them. Four came to our table to \"inspect\". They closed the meal with a shot of plum juice. It was really good, I was impressed."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends for a birthday party. This place is BOMB!!! Our server is the cutest and nicest Korean lady I've ever seen. She changed the plate, refilled the banchans, and even brought us plastic plates and forks for the birthday cake. And the food is just OUT OF THE WORLD!! Most authentic Korean food I've ever had. Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Was there today for lunch, ordered beef and duck for bbq, along with duck stew/soup. The food was great as usual but was disappointed with the service, given how often my cousin and I have been here over the past few months."}
{"text":"Great service!!! We had BBQ on the patio and I've never been to a place where they changed the grill as much as they did! Food was good and they had combos with beer."}
{"text":"We have been in search of a great Korean barbeque place in Toronto and this is probably one of the best ones so far. it's still not as good as some of the restaurants I've come ax in New York or Vancouver.  Piggy's restaurant is very busy when we arrived. they do not take a reservation and you have to wait. They took down your cell phone number and through an app you were actually able to see how far you are on the waiting list which is quite handy. When we arrived we were sixth on the list, it took about 20 minutes before we got a table. This was pretty OK except the restaurant does not really have sufficient waiting space, and we were forced to move around whenever A waiter have to go through the crowd to serve customers.  Once we were seated the service was quick. They do have a minimum order for the meat items. However they do give quite a feel side dishes, Which comes in more variety Than a lot of other restaurants.  The waiter actually help us cook the meat and cut it up for us I think this is good service. The meat is fresh and delicious and nicely seasoned. The seafood pancake however tasted a little bit under cooked.  For some reason, our seats were subjected to a cold draft even though we were not in line with the entrance door. We were actually close to the kitchen, which made me wonder if perhaps the windows were open in the kitchen.   Because of the high value a customer, I think the restaurant's goal is to get customer to turn over as quickly as possible. They're quick to take away plates, Fortunately, they do not try to rush you with the bills, which is a plus."}
{"text":"I was craving Korean BBQ and decided to come here for dinner on a Sunday. My bf and I arrived at about 6:40pm and it was pretty crowded.  At other restaurants, the host/hostess would take down your name and number of people but here, you have to do it yourself. No big deal. There were 3 names in front of mine and the estimated wait time was 30mins, but I think I waited closer to 45mins. This place is really popular, while we were waiting for a table, more people came in and after paid our meals and left, there was still a crowd of people waiting.   We ordered two servings of pork belly, rice, and soup. I also took advantage of the check in deal and got a free sprite.   Our order along with the side dishes were brought out within 10mins of us ordering. I think our servers thought we were noobs or something because she put the pork belly on the grill for us and then came back afterwards to flip the pork and cut it into smaller pieces lol. The previous times I've been here, the server just let us do our own thing.   The pork belly was so good. Writing this review makes me crave for Piggys again... When paired with the kimchi, it definitely enhances the flavour of pork. and I feel they are very generous with the side dishes. It was quite a lot of food and we couldn't finish all the food :(  To pay, you would take your bill to the front where the hostess is and pay there."}
{"text":"My dad first showed me this place a couple months ago and their food was delicious! They have a great selection of quality side dishes (Korean panchan) and the service is okay for being one of the more\"Korean\" Korean restaurants (meaning, the people who own it are Korean, the people who work there are Korean-speaking Koreans and the menu is full of authentic Korean food.   We just came back to celebrate my dad's 50th birthday and there were a number of disappointments with the waiting staff. Please don't get me wrong, the service itself is great. They bring you things when asked right away and even bring out a small side of soup and rice for my toddler, without even being asked! I'm talking more about the front desk/ Admin service. My mom called a full week in advance to make a reservation for our family of 7 (baby included) and was told that they only make reservations for 9+ people. When we got to the restaurant today, we overheard them taking a reservation for 7 on the phone! What's up with that?? Then they sat us down at a table for 6 people and said they couldn't allow us to put the high chair at the end of the table because they bring carts through the walkway- that's fine. However, we now have three adults and a high chair squished into an area that is only meant for three chairs. When asked if we could be seated in their back area with bigger tables, they said that they were filled up for the night and we should make a reservation next time. Uhhh... but we did! We tried to explain it to them but there was just nothing they could do. This was a small bump in the road to a full 5 star rating but I'm going to chalk it up to a one-time mistake.   I would still come back because the food is delicious, it's a clean restaurant and overall the wait staff is great. I would suggest talking to a second person if they give you a hard time for reservations of 7 people because their larger tables are few in number. If you have a table of 6 or less, chances are they will be able to take you no problem."}
{"text":"Never again!! I've never been to a korean restaurant that doesnt refills your side dishes at all???? We pointed to a few side dishes we wanted refilled (maybe three or four side dishes) and the guy only came back with two... when asked why he said we already exceeded our limit. Say what? We were four people, we ordered over $100 of meat and we only get two refills???? (two sides of their choice i might add). Ok i saw other ppl mention this in their reviews but this is ridiculous...They wont even give us a refill on the lettuce........o and they never came back to refill our tea either and when they finally did the guy literally slammed it on our table...anyway plenty of other kbbq places to go to in toronto... skip this one"}
{"text":"I enjoy eating at this place. There's always an awesome assortment of Korean side dishes. The food is delivered quickly and there are some interesting dishes that are not normally found in typical Korean restaurants.   I recommend going in larger groups as many dishes must be order for groups of 2 or more. Also, make use of the bell on your table for attentive service."}
{"text":"authentic Korean bbq!  Decor: spacious and lots of booths. They have a good ventilation system so you don't smell like krn bbq afterwards :P Food: generous with the side dishes, the food and meat cuts are fresh and nicely marbled. They even cut the meat for you and place it on the grill. I was even more impressed when they changed it for us without us asking.   Go and get your belly filled! :)"}

{"text":"I would readily recommend this place to anyone who likes authentic Korean food. There are tons of Koreans who come here to this restaurant, which to me is an extremely good sign that the food is good, and this place surely did not disappoint!   We got to try the set meal for pork belly which was really good, plus it had a lot of delicious side dishes. We also got to try the Korean Mandoo (steamed dumplings) which were excellent and probably the biggest dumplings I've ever seen (as big as a fist!). The next thing we tried was the Gamjatang (pork bone soup) which I found to be delicious as the meat was stewed long enough for the meat to be falling off the bones.  A tip to everyone who comes here, come early or avoid the busy weekends. We decided to have dinner here on a Saturday evening and we ended up waiting for around thirty minutes before were got to a table.  The place has a wonderful smell of fried pork, & the service is very fast & efficient. Will be coming back here in the future!"}
{"text":"I'm really loving this Korean restaurant -- this could be my favourite in Toronto atm.   I really enjoyed their pork bone soup, from their soup base, pork bone, to the kimchi,  everything was crafted in perfection. Such a fundamental Korean dish, yet not many Korean restaurants do it properly.  The second time I tried their LA Kalbi beef. Again, it was really delicious. The price is super reasonable at $17 with the tofu stew on the side and rice.  Don't get me started on their side dishes, everything tasted really fresh. My favourite is their pancakes - amazing!   I recommend Piggy's!~"}
{"text":"Service: average, mostly cos they are so busy all the time  There's almost always a line if you go between 6-7 pm on weekends.   Food: I love their side dishes, especially their pancake and glass noddles. Their table cooking is average, the meat isn't the best quality. My favorite dish there is the seafood pancake, cos they don't cheap out on the seafood. They have a patio for table cooking, but it gets insanely hot in the summer.   Price: average"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. Host was very attentive.  Place looks great and the best part is that I did not come out smelling like Korean bbq!  Saw so many other dishes from tables around us that I would like to try. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Coming to Piggy's brought back some nostalgic memories of authentic BBQ restaurants in Korea. Oh, I missed the coal-heated grill, miso paste, raw garlic, lettuce leaf wrap, and the sweet creamy dressing on the salad! Ok, they didn't have any Kkaennip (Perilla) leaves that typically come with the lettuce leaves in Korea, but they had plenty of other unique Banchan side-dishes like stewed eggplant that was delicious. The only thing missing are the neon lights, tatami floors and a shoebox at the entrance to leave your shoes in and this place could easily be mistaken for one of those fantastic back-alley BBQ restaurants in Seoul.   In Korea, many places will carry out pots of glowing red-hot coal to your table. But here, perhaps due to safety, legal, or other logistical reasons, they bring pots of cold coal to your table and use a natural gas system to heat it up. An ingenious system that has all the benefits of getting that nice coal taste but with better temperature control and safety.   There are a few things that we ordered that I thought wasn't all that great:  - The ox knee soup we ordered had very little taste and was quite bland. Perhaps it's meant to be salted to taste, but I would have liked a little more flavor from the ox meat itself.  - The pork bone soup had very tough meat and wasn't as tender as it should be. Definitely had better elsewhere. Both soups are served with plain white rice in a metal bowl instead of the nice purple rice served in a stone bowl at places like Buk Chang Dong.   A couple of items that were good:  - The seafood pancake had a decent amount of seafood but wasn't as crisp as I would like. The batter was also very thick, although some might prefer it that way as it is filling. Still quite tasty.  - The UGO fried rice with pork, egg, and cheese was interesting. Probably wouldn't order it again, but definitely worth trying once.   Now on to the food that was fantastic:  - The non-marinated premium beef ribs was an excellent cut of meat that was super tender and flavorful. A couple of strips of steak, some garlic and miso paste, all wrapped up in a lettuce leaf and you have the ultimate Korean fajitas. So good!  - The marinated beef ribs were also very good. However, our server came to replace the grill and he put the meat on right away while the grill was still cold. So the meat didn't get that quick sear and resulted in a slightly chewy meat. He should know better than to do that if he's going to help cook the meat.   Overall, I think the food here is excellent, especially the bbq entrees. The bbq meat, side dishes, and grill are fantastic and is comparable to many of the bbq restaurants I've been to in Korea. The service is also very friendly and attentive (although that one server that put the meat on the freshly replaced cold grill was being lazy). The non-bbq dishes are decent, but Cho Sun and Koryo execute them better. Next time, I'll stick to the bbq meats. Will definitely be back to try the Samgyeopsal pork belly!"}
{"text":"We decided to try a new Korean restaurant instead of our usual spot. We have made Samgyeopsal at home so we knew what to expect.   We ordered:  -Beef broth soup -Pork Katsu -4 large slices of the Samgyeopsal with the house rub on it  Pros: -TONS of side dishes - and I mean TONS -Portions are large enough to share between 2 people -The food was good  Cons: -Price was a big high for the whole meal -Can make KBBQ from home for less   Overall, it was worth a try. Not bad but for the price was a bit high. If you are someone who is looking for some new dishes to try then definitely try this restaurant. They had some cheese fried rice that was interesting."}
{"text":"I'm surprised. I thought there would be more food. Perhaps I'm just used to my BBQ specials having more food (rice and soy bean soup) come with them. We were a party of four and ordered a small (for 2 people) mook eun gi gam ja tang jeongol ($21.95) and a mook eun gi ogyeopsal for two people ($33.90). I figured we'd be stuffed full after. We weren't. We weren't hungry after, but we could have eaten more.   Their gam ja tang jeongol, one of their pork bone soup varieties, did not come on a burner. This is the first time I've had a jeongol that didn't. I was very surprised. It was not bad, but I've had much better jeongols with better portions and more ingredients for similar prices elsewhere. This came with two bowls of rice.   Their pork belly bbq, as mentioned above, did not come with rice. This too, has never happened to me before. That was confusing.  I like how their bbq pan is slanted so the oil drips off, but one of the servers put our kimchi right above where the oil drips off, so the kimchi basically soaked in the oil. I don't know if this is traditional or not, but it was unusual to me.   The banchan (side dishes) were fairly good. Like others, I quite enjoyed their lettuce with black sesame dressing. The other one, dressed with some sort of hot sauce, we enjoyed less. Both had a lot of sauce. I'm a fan of sauce, but this was excessive. One of their sides I'd never had before. It was a pork aspic. That was interesting. I liked it. We saw that another table had fresh kimchi and marinated lotus root slices. We didn't get either. I'm not sure why that was. Oh. They gave us some sort of veggie pancake. It was small and not cut up, and a tad too thick, but still nice to have.   Service was alright, but nothing great. Yelp check-in gets you a free pop!  Oh. Right above the table we were sitting at, they had a leak in their ceiling which dripped onto my cousin. Sad times.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come back, but I also wouldn't say no to a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Holy cow.  They just opened after a renovation and we didn't know.  they accommodated a very large group  for us.  The staff here are one of the best I have had for a Korean restaurant, they were nicely, friendly and super quick.  Even when it was packed.  The food here was super awesome, tasty and I couldn't stop.  We had the pork belly, beef sirloin, egg rice with cheese, dumplings, mini octopus fondue, seafood pancake and a handful of others.  all of them were great and I couldn't stop eating.  just wow!!!  Keep up the great work and keep up the great service, I will be back very shortly."}
{"text":"Yummy!  So many choices I was having trouble deciding what to eat.  Need to come back to try more.  Great place for Korean!"}
{"text":"I loved the interior when I went. Apparently they just renovated so everything looks neat and tidy. It was a cold, blustery winter night and I welcomed the heat, which is not my usual reaction. As you can tell, the ventilation was not optimum here but that's what naturally happens at a Korean bbq restaurant.  Food was great and lots of side dishes. My favourite side dish was that ball of what looked like ice cream. It was cold but my dinner date thought it was coleslaw. I also liked that pancake side dish thing.  We ordered garlic pork and UFO rice with flying fish roe and kimchi. I usually die from the tiniest iota of spice but this UFO rice had a nice kick to it. You're supposed to mix it all together before you eat it, which is what we did :) I do recommend adding the cheese because if you don't, it tastes like egg. XD  The garlic pork was already seasoned and marinated. We grilled it and staff actually came over and cut it into smaller chunks for it. Great service!  They had a bell button to call for service but we secretly think it doesn't work because we've pressed 4x to get the bill and nobody came for a good 10 min. Insanity.  It's a little pricey but def worth visiting with a group or for a special occasion."}
{"text":"So glad I came here, again by the recommendation of my Korean friend. It's not hard to find, you can see the cute little piggy face just from passing Yonge. Also not located at ktown down the street so you get free parking. I've never had trouble finding parking here, so that's good.   The interior is huge with private wooden booths and normal tables. They have an abundance of workers so service is usually fast. Some workers are smiley as the \"annyeonghaseyo\" rings out but others are more rushed in getting you to a table and out of their sight. I don't care, as long as I get to eat LOL. The food comes SUPER fast and the side dishes... oh my. So many!! So yummy and made fresh everyday! My boyfriend loves the green onion pancake that comes with it.   As summer is coming quickly to an end, I urge you to try the naeng myun. Done wonderfully, the bibim naeng myun is my FAVOURITE. Get it with a side of galbi ribs, and mmmmm it's a party in your mouth. The soups also come with purple rice, which I like. Piggy also has a lot of different choices of different gamjatangs, bibambaps and other interesting things I don't see often on other Korean menus. However, sometimes the gamjatang pork bone is a bit tough and the meat doesn't easily come off the bone like it should.   This is a VERY good Korean gem and I'm not just coming back, I'm living here."}
{"text":"Rate: 3.5 Went here with a few friends for the first time since we heard lots of great stuff about piggy's and it was recently reopened too! The atmosphere itself was very nice and it looked quite modern compared to other KBBQ places around the GTA.   We decided to order the garlic marinated pork ribs (don't remember exactly) and also the UFO fried rice. First off, the amount of sides dishes was amazing and we loved majority of them! The pancakes, mashed potatoes, and the salad with mayo + sesame dressing was our favourite.   Now on to the main dishes themselves we were quite disappointed. We could not taste the marinate from the pork and you have to be careful cooking them since they will become dry if on the grill too long. As for the UFO fried rice, the description said if you love cheese then this dish is for you, but if you actually want the cheese it is an extra $2. So why place that description when you have to charge for cheese??? The rice came in a sizzling plate with the rice in the middle surrounded by steamed eggs and cheese on top of the rice. We weren't wowed by the fried riced which was disappointing because of the description they provided on the menu.   Overall I would go again and maybe try the pork belly and more authentic Korean dishes and hopefully piggy's will live up to its rep and popularity!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location. And their smaller location on bloor. And I have to say Piggy is my all time FAVOURITE Korean restaurant.   I love their Banchan (side dishes) those mashed potatoes and onions I can have a whole meal of those!   The meat is on the higher quality side, however it can be very pricey. Minimum order is two meats so if you're just eating with yourself and a plus one it's pretty pricey. The porks are around 40 dollars while beef is around 60+.   Overall this is favourite Korean restaurant, I would recommend going in a large group to get your best bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Finally got my friends to come here with me!! It was also some of my friends' first non-ayce Korean bbq experience  We got a table in the Piggy's room tucked at a corner (did they already know that we are a loud crowd? ) Although our table was kinda isolated, the waitresses were attentive to us and there is also a button you can press if you need help  Some of the side dishes were spicy but the non-spicy one (esp the lettuce with black sesame dressing & the seafood pancake) were so good! I love the tofu soup as well, it was spicy but super delicious with rice!  As for the meat, we ordered the pork belly, marinated short ribs, premium beef and the marinated pork ribs. Portions were quite big and we were super full afterwards! Wrapping the meat and garlic in lettuce balances out the greasiness from the meat (& removes the guilt of shoving meat in my mouth non-stop). I suggest grilling the garlic on the side first to remove the spiciness (but be careful not to burn them!)  We ordered the dumplings as well. They were HUGE. But flavour wise I found it a bit blend and the skin was a bit soggy so I probably won't order it next time. Overall 4.5stars, will definitely come back next time if we want korean bbq"}
{"text":"How many ways can I describe the wonderful way the grilled pork belly melts in my mouth and the way the juices leak from the kalbi? Some really good quality meat at Piggy's and is not cheap, but it's definitely worth it (not all you can eat)! You have to order two (2) servings of any bbq meat. It comes with sauces, a variety of toppings and lettuce, to create a lettuce wrap. The crunch of the lettuce and subsequent flowing juices of the meat is so yummy.   I came during dinner with a group of 10 and we made reservations ahead of time, so no wait. The banchan (small dishes that come before the meal) is made up of a variety of kimchi, other fermented vegetables and the wonderful vegetable pancake, which is similar to the seafood pancake sans seafood. This is quite a lot of value that you're getting just with the banchans.   Every 2 bowls of rice comes with a small soup (Doenjang jjigae, which is soybean paste stew with veggies) which is quite a good deal.   The dumplings are huge, I think someone on yelp described it as the size of my fist--I would say it's just slightly smaller, but big nonetheless. They are also very tasty.   I will definitely be going back to have some more pork belly. One of the best korean bbq restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"Two words: Just phenomenal. Piggy's is an amazing place, top to bottom, for 100% authentic Korean food and not just for their barbeque, although that is probably their main attraction here. Come here and you won't be disappointed. It's that good.  First things first, this place is absolutely packed and they don't take reservations if you are under five as a group (for the weekends?). We had to wait 30+ minutes at 6:20 on a Saturday which isn't too too bad. But let's be honest, it's totally worth the wait!  This restaurant featured a really robust menu with all the Korean classics as well as more variations of these items. I.e. different types of naeng myeon, bibimbap, gamjatang, etc., And more interesting items such as a usual joint wouldn't serve such as duck and different cuts of delicious meats.   Again, I like to grade (or at least partially grade) Korean restaurants by their banchan and Piggy's side dishes were not only excellent but varied in types. They don't even give you the 'typical' side dishes, that's how special this place is. There was eggplant, different kinds of lettuce (one sweet, the other in gochujang), mash potatoes, jeon that was actually good, tendons, radishes, and of course some really good kimchi. Everything was good, that's when you know a restaurant is excellent.   And they use charcoal for their barbecue here! Charcoal kbbq tastes the best and we went with the dweji galbi (marinated pork ribs) for the BBQ course. The meat was melt in your mouth, tender, juicy, and perfectly marinated. The full set up is all inclusive including pickled onions, ssamjang, lettuce, and garlic gloves - all to make those perfect, delicious ssam wraps. Even included was rice and soybean paste stew.   If you order any of the BBQ course you can order a smaller sized naeng myeon which is a must-order. I really liked the bibim naengmyeon here which was the perfect combination of flavours (the spicy sauce was well balanced with sweetness and vinegaryness) and the noodles were so tasty and of chewy goodness. Plus we ordered the hoe (raw fish) variant, which was quite unique.   The most disappointing was their spicy octopus bibimbap, which wasn't bad at all but really lacked toppings. Their gamjatang was also quite good. Clear broth that was quite crisp with some amazing pork bones.  I already can't wait to come back to Piggy's, it might just be my new favorite Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"I guess this place is officially my go to KBBQ place! Excellent service, food was filling and reasonably priced, everything was just top-notched. If you are looking for quantity AND quality, come to Piggy's!"}
{"text":"Came here for both lunch and dinner.   The food is delicious, good quality pork grilled over charcoal. The meat is always really tender and flavourful ! I always get it ssam style which makes it extra fun - wrapping the meats in lettuce with garlic and the spicy bean paste.They also give a lot of sides such as salad, potato salad, kimchi, radishes etc. The grill burns really fast but Its great that they change the grill quite often for you. For an extra cost you can also add a bean paste soup to your meal with chunks of tofu and veggies.   The service can be hit or miss though. Sometimes pressing the button doesnt bring anyone over, especially during busy times. A meal for two costs about $60-70 dollars so its on the pricer side, but WAY better than the average ayce korean barbecue"}
{"text":"4.5 Stars: First visit and likely to return because the restaurant is comfortable (unlike our other usual Korean haunts), food is pretty good and service is prompt.  Came on a Friday right in the middle of lunch hour, but there was no wait and we got a booth seat.. yay! Extensive menu had photos so we could still make good decisions even though we are not familiar with names of the Korean dishes.   Service staff came at the push of a button and we ordered 2 soups + dumplings + UFO Rice with beef. Large variety of Banchan kept us happy till our order arrived. Kids appreciated the pancake amongst the Banchan since they don't eat spicy foods. I like that they gave us a pot of tea and a bottle of chilled water so we didn't have to flag the staff for refills.   My first time having Mook Eun Gi Gam Ja Tang - spice level was good, lots of meat, cabbage was sourish. Hubby's Friday Special Ugeoji-Gal Bi Tang was ok (very low heat level compared to my dish) and Hubby enjoyed my pork over his beef.  Kids finished the dumplings fast. I managed to steal a bite ~ tasted pretty good with the sauce they served (containing minced green chillies). UFO Rice took a looong time to come out but it tasted very good. Only problem was it came without cheese even though we didn't request that ~ they must've mixed up our order with someone else's.  There was no wait for the bill and they honoured the 10% off when I showed them a photo of their sign. Oh yeah!  Verdict: We still think the dumplings from the RH Myungdong Kalkatsu trump Piggy's dumplings, and we do live closer to the RH Owl of Minerva. But we'll try to come back to Piggy's more often because the restaurant is a whole lot more comfortable and their menu more extensive."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience here. The wait was not long because we went on a weekend. The server was keen to detail. We had asked for a booth originally however, it was full. As we were seated and deciding on our menu, a booth was cleared and they immediately accommodated us. Frequent check in with our service and our meal. Sides were great and amazing. They continuously refilled our sides and replaced our cook tops."}
{"text":"Recently renovated and looks awesome! Best to come with someone who speaks Korean, (we don't have that but have done the Korean restaurant thing enough we can get by now). Side dishes are amazing - they will tantalize all your taste buds. Service is a bit on the slow side but that's due to it being so busy there. We ordered the bonless beef rib and it was so tasty! We've tried other Korean spots and this is one we return all the time. Authentic, fresh, variety and you really get what you pay for here. Can't wait to got back, now go and eat."}
{"text":"Came into this restaurant not knowing what to expect. The only kbbq restaurant i've been to is Chako's so I expected this to be a similar experience. We ordered the Korean style beef, but were kind of hesitant as it was $40 and rice was not included. We originally thought $40 for a serving of meat was unreasonably but when they brought the food it was also accompanied by the usual side dishes (kimchi and white turnip) and 3 different kinds of lettuce ( plain lettuce leaves, ranch over lettuce, and hot sauce over lettuce), raw garlic, soup, tendons (not a big fan but the sauce was delicious), pasta, some tangy hot sauce, and a vegetable pancake (also delicious). Our waitress was amazing as she put our meat on the hot plate for us and cut it for us, not sure if this is standard practice or they thought we looked really confused as to what to do with all the side dishes. overall it was a great experience and the food was delicious. It was one of the best Korean restaurant I've been to. Only gave 4 stars as they could've listed what dishes came with the meat but I would definitely return"}
{"text":"Hands down best Korean BBQ I've been to for PORK! This place holds up to their name! I would recommend the any type of pork to BBQ from this place, their beef is OK but I've personally had better beef else where, pork is what this restaurant do best. Just like any other korean BBQ, be prepared to do some table cooking yourselves, but if you really feel like you need help don't be shy, ask for help. The waiters and waitress are extremely busy as you guys will get to see if you guys go there, but they would always help when you ask. Excellent and kind staff working at all times, also expect some 30-45 minutes of wait time when visiting Piggy's restaurant for dinner on weekends and holidays. I noticed typically the line up disappears at about 915-930PM. This place is a must visit."}
{"text":"2.5 stars   Overall is was an average experience. Did not live up to the hype and ratings, as other recent reviews have noted.  The food was average, nothing to run home about.   Will probably not be back.   Did not clearly state the refill policy for side dishes and ask if we wanted refills. Seems like they were more in a rush to leave and close. Side dishes were not the same or as good as the ones in other pictures. Maybe it was the end of the day and they ran out.   Tables, booths and restaurant could have been cleaner."}
{"text":"Great service, good and authentic food (side dishes and kimchi were delicious as well), reasonable price, modern and clean (well-ventilated) and a huge parking lot. I am Korean and I can tell you that food here can't get any better.  With above reasons, Piggy's has become one of my favourite Korean restaurants in the GTA. And it is right next to my favourite bingsu place (The Cups). I will be coming to this plaza a lot."}
{"text":"rating : 4.5 :) TDLR: good quality tasty food, mix of inexpensive and expensive depending on what you order (it's about half and half with the menu), typical K price. Recommend!!   Service was a little slow in the beginning. Had to ring them several times for them to take our order. But the rest of the time of our meal, service was pretty good. Also, they gave us SO MANY dishes. I think there was like 10 and they give u refills. They were all good too!   We ordered the Seafood pancake ($15): it was so much cheaper than other Korean places we've been! Also had good amount of seafood and pancake. Def recommend.   The octopus fondue ($40): it looked pretty cool, but the actually taste of the octypus wasn't amazing. The rice cake inside was too hard!! it was good but not a YES. but if you want it for the cheese boomerang go for it ¯\_(?)_/¯   This raw meat thing that we grill ourselves i cant remember which but it was $40: really good meat quality and they marinated it really nicely. They give you lettuce wraps and you can ask for refills.   Overall, no complaints. Very good. Will come back. Will have pics coming."}
{"text":"Got the pork belly for 2 and was able to ask for boneless beef ribs for 1 to split Large portions Lots of sides Very smokey, not all tables have range hoods Prepare to smell like bbq for the rest of the day Great service Huge step up from all you can eat"}
{"text":"I'm providing a simple yet satisfactory review for this one. Not trying to act out poetry but...  Busy  Yummy  Smelly  Pricey  Busy busy place on a Saturday eve. Try to go early since the shared lot for parking gets very hectic later on in the day.  The food is mouth-watering. Lots of meat! Very satisfactory in terms of taste. Now it's time to work it all off!!!   Smelly in a good way. Oh that Korean BBQ smell. Now it's also time to do the laundry...To wash out that smell.  Pricey. Our five adults and two toddlers cost over $300 with tip. Well worth it though for the experience. Heck if you have a fat wallet, I suggest you frequent the place! Just work it off after the fact. Isn't there a gym just north of there on Yonge St??? LOL!  Happy K-BBQing! May go back one day!"}
{"text":"People are always surprised when I say that I haven't tried Piggys yet, given that it's such a staple place for kbbq in the area. So after years of holding it off, I finally decided to go for dinner with my two friends. As expected, it was quite packed at 7pm on a Sunday night, but we were quickly attended to and got lucky with a table.   Since Piggys is known for their kbbq, we were set on ordering a serving each of pork and beef for variety. But as it turns out, unlike other kbbqs, we weren't allowed to mix & match and had to order 2 servings of the same protein. This applies even for 1 serving add-ons. I was a bit shocked to be honest, as this is a first for me.   Nonetheless, we ordered 2 servings each of their beef rib finger & signature samgyeopsal, as well as a seafood pancake. The meal came w/ six banchans & a soybean stew, to which they readily refilled the former whenever we ran out. Personally, the beef was nothing to write home about; yes, it was fresh, but i didn't find it particularly tender or tasty. I actually liked their pork belly more. Maybe it was the marinade, or the fatty bits, but the flavor was a lot stronger. As for the seafood pancake, it was an oily mess; there was literally a pool of oil on the plate. Initially, i tried scrapping the middle bits so that it's not as greasy, but I gave up after two bites.   By the end, the bill came to $134 for the 3 of us. Not worth it at all in my opinion. I've had much better kbbq elsewhere for almost half the price. 3 stars is based on food only."}
{"text":"Since my GF mentioned this place, it was about time we came here.  Though she adorably admires the cute little piggy logo, its not the reason why most come here.  Rather, its the quality and authenticity of Piggy's that makes it a popular go-to for Korean BBQ. Keep in mind if coming here during peak dinner hours you may be prepared to wait, but it's well worth it.    Our group of three decided to order an array of items, Pork belly, Kim-chi fried rice, salad, beef broth soup.  Overall their portions were sufficient, delicious and quality was evident. It totally beats out AYCE Korean BBQ.  However keep in mind, this place does get a bit pricey, but it's all about quality."}
{"text":"Great place to go for some quality Korean BBQ and tons of drinks! They serve fresh and high quality meat, so it will cost you accordingly. To compliment the delicious morsels of pork/beef/duck/seafood, they serve a wide selection of beer, soju, and makegeolli.   They have a great combo deals for a night out with family and friends."}
{"text":"This place was very good. We ordered the Korean BBQ ribs for two.  At first when I looked at it, I was like \"that's it??\" But they also provided a lot of side dishes like mashed potato 2 different salads, pickled Dicon, soup, kimchi and a few others.  By the end of it we were not overly stuffed and felt just right, it was the right amount of food for two.  We will definitely come again and try the pork bone soup!! See you soon Piggy's ;)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. But come with a Korean friend. I didn't know what the hell to order. The fatty pork that you grill table side was amazing! As was their banchan and rice. I will definitely be back! Service was good too. Plus you really can't beat the name of the restaurant: Piggy's!!!!"}
{"text":"UFO RICE! Best dish out of the stuff we ordered!  Everything else we ordered was just okay. The staff are all really friendly and helpful, and they helped us grill our food and make sure that we were doing okay.   For four people we ordered: Traditional Pork Belly, UFO Rice (DID I MENTION THAT THIS IS AMAZING?), and the Octopus Cheese Fondue. Okay so there was actually a kid with us who does not like seafood, so it was 3.5 people and this was way too much food.  Their side dishes are really good. That Black Sesame Dressing is AMAZING. The steamed egg brought me back to my childhood.  Do not get the octopus cheese fondue ---that was 150% a mistake and totally not worth it. It was watery and a bit rubbery, and because it was so watery, it was just a mess with the cheese sliding off of it. Just make this at home by yourself and make it better. I REALLY wanted to like this but I really really did not enjoy eating it. We could have ordered one UFO rice for each of us instead.  The Traditional Pork Belly is traditional pork belly. It's meat on the grill just like every other restaurant. It was not spectacular or unique, but it was yummy with the UFO Rice and kimchi and jalapenos.  Come here for cheesy eggy fried rice, not octopus fondue. Oh yeah and get the free pop with Yelp check in!"}
{"text":"Great service, clean envrionment and simply delicious. Must orders: - The massive pork dumplings - tofu seafod soup - the pork belly DIY combo with lettuce wraps"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place to take clients out to dinner. Service is always excellent and the food is very traditional and tasty. They really have their basics down perfectly and the side dishes are all so delicious. I especially love their table-top bbq with really high quality cuts of meat. A lot of people who are familiar with All-you-can-eat Korean bbq mention that the prices are too high here but I am a firm believer that you get what you pay for and the meat cuts here and the marinades really can't be compared to those all you can eat places.  I especially love their cold noodle! They are delicious and I can taste that they are made in-house -  the owner makes the noodles by hand himself. This in itself is an art as the cold noodles are very difficult to make properly (requires the same artistry as Japanese ramen noodles involving precise measurements and ratios of water:flour, resting periods, etc).  For the non-spicy cold noodle, make sure to add plenty of vinegar and horseradish/wasabi sauce they leave for you at the table. Makes for a very refreshing end of meal after the bbq!"}
{"text":"No body answer their phone on Sunday June 18, 17 at 10:20 pm. Calls forwarded to voice mail that is not activated. Trying to book a reservation. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Quite a busy place! My friend wanted to come here for her birthday. Exterior signage and interior decor was quite unique and very urban vibe to it.   It was kind of chaotic at the front desk. A whole flux of ppl started to pile in, but there was no one at the front desk. Also ppl started to bud in line and the person taking the names down, didn't even who was next. I made reservations but I would at least want to be able to announce it at the desk.   3 out of 7 of our party came 1st. Other 4 were running late. We say for quite a bit of time and they didn't give us menus nor drinks. We had to ask for it.   We ordered an extensive variety of dishes:  UFO Fried Shrimp Rice It came in a heavy hot skillet and the egg surrounding the rice in the middle was bubbling. The egg was so smooth and fluffy. I took 1 bite when it was still hot. Best eaten when it's hot. Afterwards it wasn't as good cause it cooled down.  Dumplings They were huge ass dumplings!!! Size of a toddler's fist! Came in a metal streamer. They were ok.  Seafood Pancake Also came on a heavy hot skillet. It was really good in flavour, texture was nice and moist with a slight chewiness.  Piggy's Signature Pork Belly Meat Thick stripes of meat on a hot slanted plate. As the pork cools the fat drippings slides down the slanted plate. It was also ok.  Pork Jowl Meat These came in thin stripes. I always love the texture of this cut of meat. Really moist and slight bite to the meat.  Pork Intestines Boy the intestine was long! Lol it came as a whole coil on a plate. Was trying to snip it into smaller pieces. But eventually one of the servers came to assist, and placed the whole coils on the grill and snip it as she grilled it.  This was actually my fave, really bad for your health. Lol But was also a fave of mine.  Premium Beef Sirlion When it was cooking it was a bit overcooked. Cause my friends left it on the grill for too long.  I perfer my meat medium rare. So it was ok as well.   Cool thing they had was a portable call button. Also they had different grill plates for pork and beef. We had to split into 2 tables b/c one table wasn't big enough for all of us. So 1 table had to cook the beef and we has to cook the pork. Servers were attentive afterwards in assisting us in grilling the meats. Came with a lot of side dishes. Black Sesame Dressing Salad, Sweet Kimchi like salad, Chilled Pork Jelly Meat, Pickled Radishes, Lettuce, and Sauces.   Mind you this place isn't cheap, our meal cost us way over $232."}
{"text":"We didn't try Korean BBQ; instead, we ordered squid cheese BBQ. It tastes really good! And cabbage wrap is definitely something you should try! It is authentic and not a lot non-koreans know of that dish. Cold noodles is another thing to recommend to you! it is the combination of sweet and spicy, which gives you refreshing taste experience!!!  Overal, I love everything i ordered that time"}
{"text":"We got there at 8pm on a Saturday night and 9th in line to get seated but we got our table in about 20 minutes. The host pointed at a table in the far corner and told us it was ready. She left us to find our way there ourselves but when we got there it was full of leftovers from the last table and a server had to come clean it up.   We had the signature pork belly and the grilled beef ribs with dwenjang jjigae. The food was average but it was definitely overpriced. The side dishes came with two salads that were completely drenched in sauce and in my opinion, inedible.  They had call buttons but no one came when pressed. The servers helped us cook our food which was nice. However, the hours stated they closed at 12am but the workers were telling us the kitchen was closing at 10pm.   Although it is spacious with a nice atmosphere, the high prices for average quality in a city with a rapidly developing Korean food scene will probably deter me from returning."}
{"text":"The food is always on point here. This is definitely a go to place for Korean BBQ. I love the variety of starters they have and good grade meat."}
{"text":"Came late Thurs night for dinner for 2. Ordered a double portion of marinated pork (2nd item under the juicy pork belly recommended by the server)  and a combo of bossam and beer. Bossam was underwhelming... Meat was really dry. But the marinated pork and all the sides were really good. They sorta help you cook it and cut up the meal and change the grill. Good quality meats but you pay for what you get. Would come back again and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Awesome Kbbq for a great price. The restaurant is clean and cozy with lots of seating.  We got the pork belly for 2 people and left feeling extremely fulfilled. Service was good and the waiter filled our empty banchans plates quickly."}
{"text":"Having read a number of reviews describing poor service at Piggy's, I was pleasantly surprised with their ability to handle our party of 14. We were seated in a series of 4-person tables, and were well tended to throughout the busy Saturday dinner rush.  Within my table of 4, we ordered thin pork belly and garlic pork, with two servings each (the minimum). They brought up the pork belly first, which was cooked on a rectangular tray over the standard tabletop stove. Then the pre-marinated garlic pork was cooked over charcoal. Portions are quite large, and each serving comes with a plethora of side dishes (with free refills, other than the vegetable pancake). I thoroughly enjoyed the meal, but would probably go for meats with stronger flavours next time.  The parking lot was quite full when we arrived, but there are a lot of spots, so I don't think parking should be an issue. Definitely satisfied with my experience."}
{"text":"February 10, 2018 - I went to this restaurant today. We had to wait to be seated, but the wait wasn't long. We looked at the menu as we waited. When we got our seat we ordered and the side dishes came first and then the meats and other items be ordered. The food was delicious and filling *I'm stuffed* also our cook was so nice  as I was taking my pics he made a peace  over the  for my pic..he almost lost his fingers *the heat didn't seem to affect him*"}
{"text":"nice, filling food good for group of people.. price is reasonable, kind workers. but it is little hard to find parking spot during dinner hour."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening.  Likes:  The food was good, but very pricey.  We ordered the beef at a whopping $80!  The meat was seasoned well.  Sides were also good.  The waiters and waitresses were courteous and prompt.  Dislikes:  The wait time was LONG.  We called ahead, but they do not take reservations for two people.   The gentleman that answered said it would be a 10-15 minute wait.  Well, we waited well over one hour.  Parking is a disaster as they compete with a grocery store and a few other restaurants for the parking space.  We spent an additional 20 minutes trying to park.    It was good for the experience, but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review based on a bad experience I had today.   What we ordered for lunch: Ugeoji Galbi Tang Doenjang Guk  Dduk Galbi  The service was good and the food tasted great as usual, but as soon as we finished our meal I felt really dizzy and had a drunk feeling which was definitely the MSG. I know that most restaurants use MSG, but Piggy's overloaded our food with it. My boyfriend and I felt extremely tired after lunch and for the rest of the day until now (7:30pm) we had no energy to do anything. We both developed really bad headaches and our mouths were extremely dry. I am currently having really bad heartburn as well. Not good at all!!  I don't think we'll be going back after this bad experience because I don't want to eat food that is loaded with MSG and I am really disappointed that Piggy's would need to use so much of it just to make their food taste good. That just shows without all the MSG their food would probably taste bad. Great cooks don't need MSG."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner. We had the pork belly and UFO rice.  All the food was tasty however the service was a bit slow. We left loved the light bulb glasses. You can even take them home.  I would go back because I would like to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Good tasting Korean food at a popular spot in the north end of Toronto.  Piggy's offers premium meats for their Korean BBQ. Unlike most of the KBBQ restaurants I've been to, this one is not all-you-can-eat. The quality of their BBQ meat is better but you pay for it. It's not cheap. A serving of pork belly is $35.90 for two people. It comes with quite a few side dishes, including bean sprouts, kimchi, broccoli, and lettuce (for wrapping the meat). Thank goodness it tasted good!  The pork bone soup was also quite tasty, although I prefer the one from Owl of Minerva.  Service was a bit slow, possibly because the place got really busy! The rating would have been higher if the service was faster and the prices were lower."}
{"text":"This is my favourite authentic Korean BBQ in town. Love the lettuce wraps with the soy bean sauce to go with it. Also the two salads they provide go well with the meat. Pork belly is a must,  the pork shoulder was also very good. Came back for their regular Korean fare,  which we also enjoyed."}
{"text":"We heard this restaurant gets very busy so we got there for early lunch on a Sunday; just before 11:30 am.  Even so, there were already a few tables in progress.  Ordered: LA Kalbi - really good, though the portion seems small in comparison to somewhere like Han Mi Jeong which has really good LA Kalbi and a large portion Steamed Mandu - standard, very nice A spicy pork belly that came out on a sizzling plate but I can't remember the name nor can I recognize it on the online menu - thumbs up! Fatty, meaty, spicy, tender  Service: really pleasant though slow  Wear sensible shoes, the flooring is super slippery especially when wet."}
{"text":"I have been trying to call the restaurant for two days!  Call directed to a voice mailbox that's not set up. Pls fix this asap!  Thanks."}
{"text":"I have lost track of what I ordered in this place but I would say that their melting cheese style reminds me of fondue... few things I remember ordering are the garlic beef, pork belly and that octopus fondue thingy( I will update in the future for the proper names).   This place seems very bustling with people and the quality of service is pretty good, they change the BBQ plate/grilling pretty often to ensure ur food is BBQ properly, they use diff grill for beef and pork belly, for pork belly they use a flat one in which allows excess oil to falls down in a hole allowing the pork belly to be crispy and more enjoyable.  For smaller plates of appetizers, they definitely got great variety, veggies pancakes, salads(few type), kimchi, bean sprout, soup?(maybe this came with something else we ordered lol) lettuce, sauce, garlic, radish, etc...  All food were really delicious! This place also have soju and it is excellent to enjoy food and drinks together with friends or family.  On a side note!  There's a wall that have a lot of signatures or signing lol, maybe celebrity left their stamp on that wall hehe I don't know, just guessing.  The only down side is that their dishes are quite expensive. Serving of 2 can cost u over 35$ easily, if is beef then is over 50$, thanks goodness that the meat quality are good one, otherwise good bye :)).  I really like this place, therefore I really recommend this location for hang out n food, just be ready when comes to ordering, since ur bill can stack up easily :)"}
{"text":"One of our favourite places to get Korean BBQ. Excellent quality of meats and good service. Also, they have a great variety of complementary side dishes. They recently renovated and the decor is a bit more modern. Also, I believe they expanded their menu so many other great options to choose from other than just BBQ. We really enjoyed the pork cheek on our last visit."}
{"text":"First time coming here, food was worth trying. The side dishes were cool and different as they used I believe a mayo based-sesame sauce. We wanted more side dishes but they cut us off after 2 re-fills unlike other Korean restaurants. We ordered the pork belly on hot plate and that was definitely satisfying as the portions were usual (2 orders shown in video). Would give this restaurant a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Korean restaurants I've been to. When we came, the place was packed so the service suffered a bit. But the food was delicious. We ordered this bulgulgi meal for too where we cool the food at the table. The meat was marinated just right and it was so tender. The side dishes were plenty too. I found the kimchi and spicy pickled radish spicier than other Korean restaurants I've been too but overall, great variety. Would recommend trying out this place!"}
{"text":"Piggy's restaurant serves delicious quality food and has become one of my go to korean restaurants especially for korean bbq.  I recently had the marinated beef and their spicy chicken for dinner. These two dishes were simply amazing. The beef was marinated so much that you couldn't tell if it was cooked yet. It also came with lettuce and sauce which made for a tasty combo in my mouth. The chicken was served with many vegetables and was ACTUALLY spicy. I always get disappointed when \"spicy\" food isn't spicy but this place delivers.   Piggy's is super popular and they do not take reservations so be prepared to wait. The customer service is mediocre since the staff are super busy and cannot attend to everyone. However, they do put in the effort to cook/ flip your kbbq for you, which is always nice.   In terms of price, if you go for kbbq, expect to spend around $30 +per person. The dishes are intended for a minimum of 2 people and its not ayce so you might still be hungry. Rice was also not included so we had to order that separately.   If you are looking for a place worthy for cheat day, you found it. Close your eyes and embrace the deliciousness."}
{"text":"This place wasn't as good as I remembered the first time I went. I think the menu changed and though the service was pretty quick and friendly. I went with a group of four and we all agreed. We ordered a bibimbap and several plates of pork belly  and wrapped it with lettuce. I enjoyed the side dishes and sauce that came along unfortunately the pancake dish was additional $.   Most likely won't be coming back again though it wasn't as spectacular as I remembered."}
{"text":"Very authentic Korean. Servers are very nice. Price is very reasonable. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night, didn't make reservations and waited 30mins. Its a busy spot and parking lot can get packed.   We ordered 4 dishes for 5 people and it was more than enough. The pork grilled on charcoal served in wrap lettuce was our favourite. The server comes and cook and cut it for you. The bimbimbap was less oily than the other ones I've had at other restaurants, and its served in a type of purple rice. The dumpling that came in 5 was maybe something we shouldn't have ordered as although it was good, it was very filling! Lastly we had a spicy, and sour cold noodle, very good as well."}
{"text":"A bit more variety then the usual Korean restaurants. Portion sizes are excellent, and would definitely keep people coming back for the taste, portion size and variety"}
{"text":"My absolute favourite KBBQ in Toronto. The restaurant is relatively busy around dinner but we were lucky to snag a table right away. Service is very quick. Side dishes are plentiful and so yummy. My favourite side dishes were the Black Sesame Dressing Salad and the Korean pancake!!!  We ordered the Korean Style Pork ($46.00). The cut of meat was well seasoned and tasty even without the dipping sauce provided.  As the server was placing the cuts of meat on the grill, they accidentally spilled raw meat juice onto the Korean pancake. However, they just glanced at the pancake and pushed the cart towards the neighbouring table. Only when I pointed out the juice on the pancake, did they replace the pancake."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's really busy but somehow we managed to secure a table relatively quickly. I quite like the space and the bustling ambience. Service is also quite fast and responsive.   The food itself is the best part -- so many side dishes! We got some new and unique options and my favourite were the spicy green peppers in a slightly sweet sauce; fantastic kimchi as well.  My group has a tendency to over order, but we made it alright. Everything being so delicious probably helps! We did some KBBQ (Piggy's special pork belly) which was just amazing, the flying fish roe UFO fried rice (a requisite order for your first time, but nothing mind-blowing), and spicy seafood stew, which was ridiculously flavourful and chock full of yummy seafood!  Lots of food and pretty good value also! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Sorry Piggy's.  You lose all the star this time.  Well....I'm not really that sorry.  :p  If I could drop it down to a 0, I would have.  Went back for another family meal (6 adults, 3 kids) after making a reservation on a night we knew it would be busy (Saturday night on a Father's day weekend) only to find that they had given our table away to another group.  We had to wait for additional 25 min for another table to pay their bill and the servers to clean up and haphazardly push 2 tables together to create our table.  One member of the family had to keep getting up during the meal because the table they had put together for us was blocking the path to the washroom for other patrons seated in the same area.  BIG FAIL.  When we were finally seated, our tables had greasy streaks from the table cloth they had used to wipe it down from the previous meal.  Gross #1.  Then the curious kiddies started opening up the flip top thingy that hides the gas burner starter and there was a glob of rice that was trapped in there from the servers rushing to clean the table.  Gross #2.  Then when we went to use the washroom, there were flies buzzing around with that distinct urine smell as if they had not cleaned it for days.  Gross #3.  When we were leaving the washroom, we could see a man butchering up different cuts without a hairnet and the door wide open to the washroom area where we had just seen the flies freely roaming about.  Gross #4.  All of these factors really turned me off their otherwise good food.  Cleanliness of the restaurant or lack of cleanliness always makes me questions how clean they keep the kitchen and their storage where the food is kept and prepared.  Judging from the lack of cleanliness at the table and the washrooms, I'd hate to imagine what it looks like in the kitchen.    It was a hot evening and the A/C was not on high enough so cooking with charcoal at the table was uncomfortable.    Unless Piggy's really clean up their act and start doing things better with something as basic as properly cleaning tables, I will not be returning for a 3rd visit."}
{"text":"This is, to date, my favourite stop for Korean food. The quality of the meat here is amazing, which makes any order for barbecued meat a MUST (especially for the beef short ribs and pork belly!) As most, if not all, Korean restaurants, Piggy's serves a selection of sides that most consistently has kimchi and bean sprouts but everything else can change. They also serve a salad with this AMAZING house-made sesame dressing that I could eat ALL DAY LONG (which is saying something, because salads are not my thing). The service here is pretty good too, which only makes a good thing great :)"}
{"text":"Loving Piggy's Restaurant!   Lots of positive things to say about this restaurant.   Pros: - Food: You have a large amount of appetizers to go along with your meal as well. As well as the meat is seasoned really well. The servers will help you to cook the meat and cut it up for your table as well!  - Service: The service at Piggys is quick. Although they are packed most times I've been there, a server will come by your table to check up on your during most of your meal as well as get you whatever you need. You won't feel intimidated to ask for additional dishes or whatnot during the course of your meal.   Cons:  - Wait times: If your going during prime time lunch or dinner, be warned that you may be waiting for a long time to get a table. - Order: It sucks when you go with two people and you are forced to get the same type of meat because you aren't able to mix and match. You have to order 2 orders, but it doesn't leave room for trying new options if you go with a small group - Seating: If you go in a large group, it may be hard to get seating where you'll be able to sit with everyone. Groups of 4-6 are easier to be seated all together.    Foods I like: - Seafood Pancake (Comes with the tables order and appetizers)  - Signature Pork Belly - Garlic Beef   #iamapiggy"}
{"text":"This review based on the standard Korean dishes and not the Korean BBQ. Although now I wish I had opted for the Korean BBQ instead.  Side dishes (onion pancake, kimchii, kimchii radish, soy potatoes, cabbage, cucumbers). The only side dish I really liked was the onion pancake. The others were meh as Jennifer K. would say.   Beef rib in soup with rice (Friday lunch special) $8.95 - I got three pieces of beef ribs. They were soft and tender but not very large in size. Soup was tasty and not overly salty and was packed with veggies.   Cheong guk jang and bibimbap $9.95 - basically came with like a kimchii soup and bibimbap with no meat. Tasted okay but without some kind of meat to accompany the dish it made it really boring.  I don't think I have ever had so much veggies in one meal. This is why I wish I had opted for the Korean BBQ. There is always next time."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place for dinner but I think getting soup stews (Pork Bone + Ox Bone) was a BIG mistake. 95% of customers seem to be eating BBQ so that must be what they're known for.   Pork Bone Soup was 7/10 Ox Bone Soup is no more than 2/10 - it came out milky but tasted like hot water with 3 strips of chewy beef...adding in salt did not help unfortunately  It was also more expensive than other places such as the owl but those are better!"}
{"text":"Oink oink bacon lover! OK maybe not so much bacon but you get the idea. So this Korean restaurant I think has the best kalbi. Nice thick piece and cook to perfection blesses. It's so awesome you must get it!!!   I got the stir fry octopus and rice in hot stone and hmmmmmmmmmm it's so good! The amount of spice and rice hell yea!! I have also gotten the pork bone soup and I ordered it late at night one time maybe 9pm? The pork was like a mission to get pork off the bones. Usually chopsticks and spoon should be good enough but I had to man handle these suckers like I man handle my weights! I was quite disappointed in how hard they were to come off. Again though maybe it was due to getting pork bone soup late or maybe everyone's tired. Definitely not happy with that pork bone soup. However I will probably try again to see if it's the same or not.   The menu they have is quite something. If you love pork bone soup they offer different types of pork bone soups and bibimbaps oh my god it's to die for! Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Gotta love Korean BBQ! I was told by a coworker about this spot and how authentic it is. It's truly a different experience from what one would experience at an AYCE. The quality of the meat is top notch with it being super tender, flavorful and wonderfully marinated. It was also nice to have a person come to the table and cook the meats for you. We ordered the garlic beef and it came with a whole bunch of side dishes and lettuce leaves which we were encouraged to use to wrap the meat with and eat it as a wrap! All side dishes are refillable and so tasty! The spicy lettuce, seaweed and spiced broccoli are yum! We also ordered the bulgolgi and octopus hot pot since it was a bit chilly and a friend suggested we warm ourselves to some soup. And my we were all not disappointed as it was packed with a good amount of spice and seafood flavor, noodles, veggies, tofu, bulgolgi and octopus. Aside from the food, the ambiance as well as the service was on point with the servers coming over to refill our tea and water, ask if we want any side order refills as well as helped us cook our meat.   I definitely reccomend this spot! For four friends, we were stuffed and satisfied with what we ordered along with the sides it came with."}
{"text":"Oh what a fun place to have korean bbq!! Although their meat is not as high quality as their competititor, Sariwon, they are still very delicious.  We ordered a kalbi and a pork dish.  Their kalbi was marinated very well but I feel like the marinade might have overpowered the flavour of the meat itself.  The pork dish...unbeknownst to us was semi-grilled already and we had to cook it further.  I wasn't too big of a fan of that one (probably will order something else next time).    In terms of side dishes, there were plenty but really, they didn't refill that many for you.  Gone are the days when you could have unlimited refills on Korean side dishes.  :(   Service was amazing - our server so happy and friendly, she made  our experience awesome.  The meal also comes with a small soon tofu soup, which was very delicious and flavourful too.  Dishes do not come with rice but we only ended up ordering one to share."}
{"text":"Busy at Saturday night. Waited for about 30 mins.  Had very high expectation, but it turned out to be very disappointed after we drove all the way here. Mediocre meat. Except appetizer, nothing great about this place. Our waiter only said three words, no follow up, no instructions what to do. We had to figure out ourselves.  The waitress came to turn off the heat before confirming with us if we are done, again no words, our meat still not cooked.  Each plate of beacosts around $70, for three people, we only could order 1 plate of garlic beef which turned out to be a bad decision.  We will definitely not come back."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere were great for me so I'll give this place a 4. Service however was not the best but it'll do.   We came in for lunch on a weekend to find the restaurant fairly busy but we didn't have to wait. We ordered two, two person orders of Korean BBQ meats, cold noodles, seafood pancake and a rice. For meats, we selected the pork belly (obviously) and a beef dish. The grill came and I was fairly surprised to see that they use charcoal, that was definitely a plus for me. Typical korean side dishes are included with your meal. I really enjoyed the pork belly, finding it good quality meat which was extra tasty over a charcoal grill, wrapped in lettuce with some ssam sauce and other side dishes. The seafood pancake was a bit crispy on the outside which I really liked! They have a few large vents above the tables.   I'd visit again."}
{"text":"Nice traditional Korean BBQ. Servers are nice but usually busy. They'll do the coking for you but I was getting impatient.  Still food is awesome. Pork belly so good."}
{"text":"Monday's special: Ttuk Bae Gi Gam Ja Tang ($7.95). It's pork bone soup with cabbage, potatoes, crushed perilla seeds, perilla leaves, and garlic. Spicy and delicious. The only thing I would change is that the meat could have been a little more fall off the bone. One yummy shoutout to the side dishes.   I also tried their Korean BBQ last year. I remember it being one of the better kbbq places I've been to. My favorite was the boneless rib with garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Huge place that serve Korean BBQ in this area. Nice ambiance. Not very busy on sa saturday, waited only 10 minutes for a group of 7, they do not take reservations.   Ordered the dumpling, seafood pancake, beef n egg bibimbop, belly pork samgyeopsal and belly pork special samgyeopsal. Love the pancake and radish with pork belly special samgyeopsal. Servings are huge. They provided a wide variety of appetizer and i love the lettuce salad and spicy tendon.   Service is really good and our server explained how the eat the samgyeopsal as this is our first time."}
{"text":"Havent been to Korean bbq in a while and this place came highly recommended, and for good reason! We had their Korean pork, the soup special for Friday, and dumplings.  Pros Meat came wonderfully seasoned Side dishes were plentiful and fresh...and seconds are free Dumplings we're huge!  The sauces that came with the dumplings and meat were so tasty They cook and mind the meat for you, even cutting it and changing the pan so you dont get burnt meat If they burn the meat they replace them  Cons The meat platters came in a minimum of 2-people servings. After that you can get single servings. So if you're dining el solo..you'll have plenty to take home Since it's a minimum 2-ppl servings, and there was only 2 of us, we couldnt order more of the other meats to try. The price is pretty steep (say $70 for an order of beef, around $40 for pork) so if you order a few you're looking at a lot of food to take home or a lot of food and $ wasted.  It wasnt too busy when we got there but some of the meat still got burned so they got us replacements which i thought was nice. What was a real con for me was when the server lifted the plate of raw meat and spilled raw meat juices on our dumplings. She looked at me and apologized but didnt offer replacements (remember these are inedible dumplings now since the blood from the raw meat got to them). I had to ask for replacements twice (3 of the 5 dumplings got hit. If it was just 1 I probably wouldnt have bothered) and she said she'll have to ask the manager. She did eventually come back to say they'll get replaced. The soup wasnt that good, the beef was chewy, I would skip it (forgot the name but it was the soup they have on the menu for Friday)  Overall it was a solid experience. The food was really good, the service wasnt bad eventhough I thought it was unnecessary that I had to ask for a replacement. I thought that should have been offered right away (considering how much they charge for their food and because we really cant eat the dumplings at that point). At least the servers were nice and apologized. We'll probably come back and just make sure the cooked stuff is not in the line of fire of the raw stuff."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! For tabletop cooking, really a hard place to beat. Their selection is large. Their specials for traditional food staples like seaweed and mussel soup never fail to impress. The staff are attentive, the table stovetops are powerful, and I've been impressed with the quality of ingredients and culinary skill put into everything that is available on their menu. I've had soups, mandoo, tabletop, etc. here. Casual enough to bring friends and larger rowdy groups to. I don't recommend bringing a date here though, unless you'd like to spend the evening in silence! It's much too loud for conversation, even when you are sitting across from one another. Maybe sitting next to one another will be better? ;)  For the cost-conscious, the prices are fair and the portions are well-matched. You are unlikely to leave hungry. They also provide a solid selection of side dishes. I've never been here while the patio is open. I hope to this summer."}
{"text":"Piggys is back! They're finished renovations and you can go back and enjoy their delicious pork belly. You will be hungry because you will be waiting in line for a table for about an hour during their peak times. While waiting you will smell everyone else's deliciously Korean BBQ pork belly and other meats.   If you're not drooling by now then you shouldn't come to this restaurant. Service is standard, they are very busy but have answering calls/bells for each table which I find useful cause you will never be able to wave down a server.   Price has not changed, atmosphere is very busy, lots of oil/BBQ goodness all around. Yea your clothes and hair will reek afterwards."}
{"text":"*The restaurant is quite spacious with several ventilation on top of the tables.   *There are several famous Korean celebrities who actually have eaten at Piggy's! I only recognized G.NA and Brian Joo (Fly to Sky), the rest I wasn't familiar with.  *I rarely seen this type of Korean BBQ where they grill the meat over charcoal in the GTA! The grills burn quite fast but the servers will continuously change the grill throughout the meal, so no worries!  *Ordered the Dae Ji Mul Leok for $40. Because of the said price, I was expecting for more banchans (side dishes), such as bean sprouts or seaweed for the lettuce wraps.  *The marinate was pretty good, not too heavy on the garlic yet still flavorful. Was it worth the $40 price tag? I say yes if you are like me or your friend isn't too hungry, I think if there were 2 hungry guys, this will probably not enough.  *Once the meat comes, the servers will do all the cooking for you, including cutting the meats into bite sizes for the lettuce wraps.   *Although not as good, but it's probably the most authentic Korean BBQ experience that you can get outside of Korea."}
{"text":"First time been to this restaurant, very busy on a Saturday night, lucky we made a good choice and made a reservation so we been seated right away when arrived. The food was average, I think their beef taste better. We tried their signature pork belly, nothing special and would not recommended, garlic beef was the best, Boneless beef rib was just average. Personally I would prefer the meat at \"Gyu-Kaku\" more tender and favourable.   There is an exhaust system on top of every grill table, however doesn't seen working very well, I guess alot of other BBQ restaurant with the exhaust system that installed with the table does a better job.   Is not an all you can eat bbq so it is pricy but you get better quality of meat."}
{"text":"Garlic beef and Korean style pork grilled at the table. Soooo good. More pricey than most Korean grills but the quality is amazing! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Purchased the Samgyeopsal, octopus w/ cheese/corn/egg surrounding it, & a light bulb w/ a light on it.  Overall very comforting establishment, took my parents our for my mom's bday. Cost overall before tax was $128 for the above mentioned. As a sense of kindness they even gave us free mini Sundubu-jjigae.  The banchan (Korean side dishes) were quite unique and the service is above par exceptional. They have keen waitors & waitresses who may casually notice and try to make certain your grill is changed so then not burned. To which then after being changed will assist in cooking and providing insight on typical ways of eating them.  Very kind hearted establishment overall and I'd say if I were to eat there again maybe just get Samgyeopsal (Korean traditional BBQ w/ grilled pork belly) w/ maybe another grapefruit light bulb, to which you can take with you by the way."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Korean restaurant. The food is yummy and also cheap. They don't serve dessert and mostly are not fluent English speakers"}
{"text":"Yesterday lunch in Piggy with friends, saw a live mouse passed the aisle. We were all shocked. The stuff cleaned up quickly like nothing happened."}
{"text":"Expect to wait for a table. They don't take reservations for any party less than 8. The food was good and the side dishes were good too. They are expensive though. My bf had the pork bone soup and said the meat didn't fall off the bone and he really had to fight with the bone. Keeping in mind the restaurant is actually known for the BBQ we weren't surprised."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!!! Super amazing cuts of meat !!! That kalbi is absolutely bomb!!! I just wished they weren't so expensive I mean it pretty much cost $50-$60 a person just for one meal. I mean minimum wage isn't that high.  The ambience of the restaurant is great as well as the service"}
{"text":"Piggy's I've been hearing lots of good reviews from my friends so I went Sunday noon, the waiters aren't fluent in English so you need to have patience speaking to them and hand gestures is key.   We ordered the beef and it was really pricey at $80 +tax. The beef was cut super thick so it took a long time to cook it through.   The Samgyupsal on the other hand is so much better, super crispy and delish I loved it. Price wise it was 1/2 the beef's cost  Like most Korean restaurants the side dishes are refillable and that was a nice addition which we appreciated"}
{"text":"Interesting choice of table cooking, including duck meats, eel and seafood. Also have some good collection of Korean alcohols.  Attentive service as long as you ring the bell installed at your table. Food come out hot and fast too. Looking at the menu, it seems to suit group of two of more, since table cooking option require minimum of two diners.  Although the portion seems good and the menu has some creativity, I do think the food taste arena can be improved. Especially the duck meat and beef patty does not have much duck nor beef taste."}
{"text":"Probably the best Korean BBQ I've ever had in Canada. I'm not sure about you, but I've only been to KBBQ places that are \"All You Can Eat\" and they're usually just average. However, Piggy's isn't \"All You Can Eat\" and instead you order based on serving size.  To start off, I went to Piggy's on a Tuesday night and it wasn't busy at all. The lady was very nice and I love how Korean restaurants always have the little button when you need something. The service was really fast and the food is incredible!   We ordered the Saeng Samygeopsal (pork belly) and it was the best pork belly I've ever had! The pork belly was really juicy and they were really big slices. Eating the pork belly with the lettuce and sauces was absolutely amazing! All the flavours come together really nice and it was delicious!   Overall, if you're craving KBBQ and you're around the Thornhill area, you must check it out! Also, if you check in while you're there, you get a free pop with any purchase (I didn't know since I checked it at the end since I almost forgot to)."}
{"text":"Great korean bbq place! Usually wait for the table here since its always so packed even the large restaurant space. The meat quality is good for the bbq and there are enough staff to be able to request for drinks and or changing the grill. Banchan at this place is pretty good Ive only had the bbq here, and my review is only for the bbq"}
{"text":"-WOW the service here was incredible. The staff were very attentive, smiling and even made some jokes with us.  - We ordered the Pork belly and beef rib for BBQ. Both were very tasty.  - There are a lot of side dishes and they replenished the dishes we requested.  -Worth a visit! This place is busy for a reason."}
{"text":"We ordered the Signature Pork Belly kbbq and was nothing more than disappointed. There was no marinate, so the pork belly essentially tasted bland, hard, and had a distinct pork odor to every bite. Overall the food was either over seasoned, which led to very sour kimchi or the absolutely bland pork. We also ordered a bibimbap which was OK but very average. This place was not particularly cheap either because you are looking to pay at least $20+ per person if you intend on doing their kbbq.   After our meal, we were thirsty and OUR STOMACHES DID NOT FEEL WELL. It was overall not a good experience. Our servers were nice and the restaurant is very packed, but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've waited this long to try this place - it's amazing!  I ordered the seasoned pork belly BBQ. Right off the bat, I appreciate the cleverness of the grill itself, it is designed to sit at an angle with a drain at the end to prevent melted fat from accumulating. There is also a compartment just for grilling garlic slices so it doesnt get soggy from the pork.   The meat itself is good quality, and when you order a portion for 2, it is enough for 2 people, because on top of the pork belly, you also get these amazing side dishes that comes with the meal - a lot of it (and you can ask for refills). My favorite side dish there is hands down the \"pork skin\", which sounds gross but it tastes great. A close second is the salad with the sweet seaseme dressing. YUM!  The only thing I don't like, and I am being picky here, is the \"bowl\" they give you for the carbonated rice wine drink - it kinda looks like a pet water dish lol. The drink itself is great and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Service with a smile. And I mean that!  I don't know if it was my good looks or charm. But they took care of us and served us well. And the food!  Try the duck!!"}
{"text":"My family and I came to piggy's for lunch after seeing the 4 star yelp rating. We must of ordered all the wrong dishes because everything was very mediocre.    Let's start with the seafood pancake, it had a good amount of seafood in it but it was thick and soggy. I ordered the ox stew for my parents and pork bone soup for us because they can't eat spicy food but that was a poor decision because the ox soup was so tasteless that even my parents thought it was bland.  The pork bone soup was good thought.  Our last order was the kalbi, decent marinate but the meat was a bit chewy.  The best part of our meal was actually the side dishes.   Compare to the other Korean restaurants we frequently visit, piggy is newer and more modern but it also comes with higher prices."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Mother's Day.  Put our name down for 5 people.  I see empty, uncleaned tables. We wait for 30 mins, nobody looks at us.  Go ask the girl how much longer, she already crossed us off as if they sat us!  Waited ten more minutes, she's twiddling her fingers while tables are free but not cleaned.  Lots of people waiting.   We are seated after I complain.  No menu, no cups, no cutlery.  We go up and get it ourselves.  We then order our food. Write it down and hand deliver to the kitchen.  The wait staff came 3 times: to put the grill down, to deliver food, to tell us the kitchen is closing.  Not once did they come check on us or even acknowledge us.    It's Mother's Day, staff your restaurant properly.  Hostess, take the smirk off your face and clean off tables instead of watching your line build up.   Funny enough, they have a sign that said \"the customer is king\" but ironically the \"king\" fell down and it's like \"the customer is nothing\".  Seems like you're living up to your motto!"}
{"text":"I came here for a quick lunch and left feeling happy and full!  The place was quite spacious which was nice since BBQ place can quickly become smoky and eating experiences are always better when the air is clean!  We ordered from their lunch menu instead of BBQ, and there is a nice selection of meats veggie wraps, soup, rice stone bowls and other mains. We got kalbi with rice, spicy pork rice stone bowl and katsu, they were all big portions and very delicious.  I really like the side dishes as well, they are not your typical fish cake and bean sprouts, there were some veggie salad, beef bites, mashed potato, but also old favourite like pancake, kimchi radish, and seaweed soup.  Overall a great experience. Got professional like service as well in that they weren't super friendly but very accommodating and attentive.  Would I go again? Definitely."}
{"text":"This place was simply delicious! As a huge fan of Korean BBQ, this is one of my favorite spots in Toronto. The quantity and quality of food is very good for what you pay for! Everything is marinated perfectly with lots of flavor. The plum juice at the end was the perfect way to end the dinner and to die for. Very satisfied and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to stop by here for a quick lunch today since their re-opening! Boy oh boy am I impressed!! The newly renovated place looks fantastic, with vents at every table for table BBQ, and not to mention the seating is very roomy and comfortable!   Considering I only came by myself, I could only order one dish... Of course I'd get the pork bone soup that they perfect every single time. First off, I'd like to say I was IMPRESSED as soon as they put my appetizer dishes down, they were in generous portions and the bonus was the huge PANCAKE that it came with! I have yet to visit a place that offers that... They definitely won my heart when I saw that on my table. Service is prompt here, with a press of a button and they're at your table right away. Convenient, eh?   I noticed they have a dish called UFO fried rice, and will definitely be back really soon to try it out with my family and friends!"}
{"text":"Pork bone soup was waterdown.  We ordered beef bibimbap but it seems they forgot to put beef in it .. no meat. Once you tried Owl of Minerva and Sharon Garden Pork bone soup, it will make it your point of reference."}
{"text":"Went here as a recommendation from my Korean friend and I was disappointed. Korean grill house is better in terms of taste and service. We came around 9pm on a Sunday so it wasn't that busy - when we sat down, most people had already finished eating.  My family went here for my brother's bday and we had kbbq. We ordered a seafood stew, 2 portions of their tradition pork belly, 2 garlic beef, a squid cheese fondue, a Canadian beer specifically because they had ran out of Heineken, and their bulb soju drink.   They brought out the wrong beer and forgot about my drink and had to be reminded. I had asked multiple times for the same thing such as getting hot sauce, or a certain side to be refilled  Everything that we ordered was bland. Garlic beef had no flavour of garlic, pork belly was not marinated, and the squid was fishy.  Don't go here and waste your money - for the amount that we spent going to Chako or Korean Grill House would have been a better and cheaper option"}
{"text":"This is our standard \"go-to\" for Korean on Sunday's.  This is mostly a BBQ restaurant but I like the beef bone soup (Kalbitang).  The oxtail soup is also good. (Gorrigomtang)."}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I gave a restaurant all five stars. I have been craving pork bone soup for a very long time and finally persuade my boyfriend to go. Surprised to see that we were able to find parking which is so rare to find in the busy streets and intersection of Yonge and Steeles. Glen Cameron Road actually had a plaza filled with mention worthy restaurants! So happy we did not struggle to find parking!   We walked right in with no reservations and was greeted and seated immediately. I love their setting and the atmosphere of the restaurant. I think the hardest part about deciding what to eat was going through all the reviews and over 400 pictures of Piggy's restaurant.   I HAD to choose the pork bone soup and totally did not regret my decision. I loved it. Although three pork bones was a lot of me, my boyfriend had no problem taking it home. The flavor of the soup is something I will always crave during the mucky rainy weather!   My boyfriend chose the bulgogi to be safe and it was delicious. The meat wasn't to oily or dry and it was seasoned well. His only complaint was that there was too much veggies but I didn't mind!   We had to get the fist-sized dumplings for $12. BEST DUMPLINGS EVER. I wish they had an option for smaller ones because those dumplings were soooo filling! Packed with so much meat and veggies and the sauce goes very well with it. DO get the DUMPLINGS! Another dish we had to try was the seafood pancake. I was already full from all the other stuff we had ordered but the pancake was delicious. For $15, I think I will skip the pancake next time and just indulge in the dumpling and soup.   This was the bestest restaurant I ever been to, food-wise, service-wise and everything. I was so content with the food and service that I vowed to bring my family and friends here just to wow them with the experience. The service was amazing, they were super quick and efficient!   I just can't wait to try the other food dishes they have to offer, I must try the korean BBQ next time!   Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant because we heard from Alex that it was good! The place was clean and the food arrived quickly! We wanted to try a variety of food so we ordered kal bi, dumplings and pork bone soup. We found the food resembles a lot like home cooking, meaning salt is to its minimal. I particularly like the side dishes, especially the vegetable pancake. The kal bi was very juicy and it also came with a bowl of purple rice and tofu soup. We ordered a mild pork bone soup and can really tastes the thick soup base rather then having it overwhelmed by the spicy sauce, which was delightful. The dumplings were big and the skin was al dante. We enjoyed it very much and will likely try their table cooking next time!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and quick response to our request every time.  Very delicious side dishes and lots of variety  All the meat are very fresh.  Always my first choice for Korean food!"}
{"text":"Food: 2.5 stars My friends and I came here for lunch a few Tuesdays ago and it was pretty quiet. They started us off with 5 side dishes and a small deep fried pancake. My favourite banchans were the black beans in a sweet and salty sauce and the pancake. We ordered Mandu Jeongol to try the giant Korean dumplings and Saeng Samgyeopsal to share between the 3 of us. Both dishes come in a serving size for 2 people and we definitely had food left over.  The Korean dumplings were just dumplings on steroids, nothing exceptional about the filling or the dumpling skin. I did like how the soup was not too spicy or salty. There are some noodles at the bottom and I think there were slices of sausages, rice cakes, and vegetables.  The pork belly wasn't melt-in-your-mouth but still tender enough. Make sure you try it with the 2 sauces that come with it, otherwise it is pretty tasteless. This dish comes with some pickled radish, tofu, and spicy peppers for you to wrap with your pork belly. Not a fan of the pickled radish or the spicy peppers. The cabbage we got to wrap the pork belly in was a little thick as well.  Portion sizes were great but unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations.  Ambiance: 3 stars Spacious and clean restaurant. Hard dark wood booth seats. It was quiet on a Tuesday afternoon, which is nice if you want to chit chat without losing your voice.   Service: 3 stars Standard service. We got all our food in a timely manner and the lady serving us was polite."}
{"text":"Dude... I've been giving crappy reviews due to lack of quality and service... but this restaurant right here!!!! reminded me why I started reviewing food and restaurants!! This place right had everything that I was looking for and exceeded my expectations.  This is a Korean restaurant, its famous for its pork bone soup, which my gf decided to get and I got the pan fried bolgugi dumplings and the seafood pancake. And dude... I almost passed out midway. I was full like I couldn't believe the food was soooo delicious I couldn't stop eating and not finishing would be a sin!   The porkbone was soo tender and the broth was rich and spicy, she asked to make it spicy. The pan fried bolgugi had an addictive flavour which had me craving for more. The dumplings were on a next level of amazingness!!! The sauce they served it with is unbelievably delicious I need to get the recipe for this. If anyone knows what it is please lemme know! I'm not really a fan of the pancakes but jeeeeeeze!!!! This was truly amazing, crispy button and full of flavour, also served with that sauce... also when you check in you get a free pop.    Will I come back? OF COURSE IM COMING BACK EVERY WEEK lol loved this spot had an amazing experience and hopefully it's like that every time."}
{"text":"Piggy's is another hot spot for Korean BBQ, and during peak times, you'll see a crowd of people waiting in line for a seat. It's best to come during off-hours if you're able to.  The service here is pretty good, if you're able to converse in Korean. Fortunately, I've got someone who can do so :).  The side dishes here are just okay. I'm a big fan of their veggie pancakes, but everything else not so much. This is just personal preference though.  With a huge craving for meat, we ordered thinly sliced pork belly of the menu. The quality of meat is alright. Some pieces are tender and juicy, and you'll get the odd chewy, muscley piece.   Piggy's Restaurant went through a major renovation and the place looks a whole lot better. Try this place out if you're in the area and there's no line up. Otherwise, there's plenty of other places in the area that will satisfy your Korean food cravings."}
{"text":"Came here with a group with friends who were on a repeat visit. In a word, excellent. The place was bustling but clean and well attended. Banchan came out promptly and included kimchi, potato mash, pajeon, and tendon; everything delicious. We ordered platters of pork and beef, including rib fingers, marinaded steak, and pork shoulder butt. All the meat was on point, and demonstrated to me a careful selection of cut/quality of meat overall. Special mention for the the marinaded meat (even our friend that doesn't really like garlic agreed that the marinade made it all the more delicious). The plum wine soju was unpleasantly astringent and medicinal, reminiscent of jagermeister (our fault for trying something new and not knowing what we were getting into---we recommend the grapefruit soju as a safe choice). But beyond food, I'd like to also remark upon the service, which was impeccable. There were multiple instances for which a waiter/waitress attended to our needs without flagging them down/using the call button beyond simply keeping our glasses full for water--- to change our gas, to change our grill, to adjust the grill heat, to flip and portion our meat. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"3.5  ATMOSPHERE:  They renovated this place to look a bit more modern - I almost forgot that I had been here previously. Came here on a Friday night, and the place was jammed. Without a reservation, we were given a table but told (nicely) that we would need to be gone within an hour and a half - it was totally understandable with the herds of customers literally creating a fire hazard by the front door.  FOOD:  Lots of traditional Korean dishes available, and generous complimentary appetizers. I was disappointed though that they no longer serve the cheesy spicy chicken dishes. The bulgogi was a bit inconsistently heated, but was good enough. The UFO rice with pork was a different tasting experience, in a good way, but hoped for a bit more cheese. The seafood pancake was a bit soggy for my taste, but was well-seasoned and ample in size.  SERVICE:  As service was quick, we were in and out of there within the 1.5, as expected. The staff was very friendly about it however, which was appreciated.  VERDICT:  I'll be back to have the korean BBQ, which looked very enticing."}
{"text":"First time coming to this restaurant. I came here on a Thursday night but I didn't expect it to be busy on thursdays. We got escorted to our table within minutes.   The menu lots of options. You can order the Korean BBQ and or just soups, noodles, and casseroles. We didn't feel like BBQ tonight, so we ordered the Mul Naeng Myeon and the Beef Bugogi. Once we rang for the server, he arrived promptly and took our order. After 5 to 10 minutes our free appetizers including the pancake, which not many places offer. Their pancake was delicious. It was perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and very well proportioned so it was cooked evenly. One of the best I have eaten. The Mul Naeng Myeon came first and it was a good size. Many places make this slightly different, this place does not add the pear and only has one piece of beef sadly in comparison to other places. However, it serves with sweet potato vermicelli instead of the buckwheat noodle in other places. Overall, the dish was still good. The kitchen did messed up our order and we notified our server and he went to fix it immediately.  We waited another 10 minutes for it to come, which was fine. The entire time that we were eating, people were coming in nonstop. It got really busy. When then our Bugogi came, it tasted good as well. The prices for both dishes were fair compared to other places we went. We were both very satisfied with the service and the food. And we paid at the front. Food quality was pretty good.  Although, we didn't order any Korean BBQ other tables did and normally places that does this are not ventilated well. But this place is the best I have seen so far. They have almost ventilation at every table. So even with most tables doing BBQ, you don't get the smelly aftermath in your clothes. And you don't feel or sense the smokiness at all."}
{"text":"It was my first time here just last week and I'd say it was an okay Korean restaurant. They offer a variety of different types of Korean soups and a lot of different types of Korean meat BBQ options (pork belly, bulgolgi, short ribs, lamb). Overall I had an okay experience here but I would probably not come back. It was okay but not great.   Service and Environment: It took us around 10-15 minutes to get a seat because we were waiting for them to clean some tables. This restaurant is pretty big with plentiful people leaving and coming, but the servers seem a bit disorganized when it comes to cleaning the tables right away and just leaving it until the last moment when customers have to sit down. However, service got better when we sat down. There's a button on each table for you to click anytime you need something and they usually come right away. I also like how the restaurant is very spacious and airy - there were a lot of tables doing Korean BBQ, but I never felt congested with the smoky smell.  Food: Bulgolgi Korean BBQ (Beo Seot Bul Go Gi) This I believe was around 35-40 dollars? It came with Bulgogi with glass noodles and vegetables. Some of their side dishes included: seafood pancake, mash potatoes, two salads (one was caesar and the other one was with kimchi sauce I think), kimchi, radish, seaweed, lettuce, and the soy-based sauce to dip your lettuce wraps with. Unfortunately it didn't come with rice so we had to order that separately. The meat and glass noodles were pretty good. I really enjoyed the seafood pancake and radish as well. The salads and mash potatoes were meh."}
{"text":"Heard good reviews about this place, and finally got the chance to try it. It is an okay place nothing special, food is good but nothing stands out. The reason for the three stars is the service, the staff are slow to take orders, and I checked in and got a free pop, the waitress started to hit my phone with her pen to redeem the voucher!!really! So unprofessional."}
{"text":"My farts stunk so bad for the rest of the night after eating here. Dinner was great though! A bit pricey."}
{"text":"Great Korean BBQ, we got the Korean style pork and it's marinated quite well. Also, instead of just a gas BBQ, they put coal on top of the gas stove, giving the food some coal flavor. That's very special. Seafood pancake was ok, a little too filling. The pork bone soup is good too, but the meat did not fall of the bone. I guess some people like it that way.  I would come back again. Pretty good."}
{"text":"Awesome service and great variety of delicious side dishes. We like their duck roast and duck soup the most even though this place is known for their pork as the name implies."}
{"text":"Pretty good place, it's a mixture of old and modern Korean restaurants, especially after their renovation, awesome ambiance, very friendly people. Their main dishes are delicious, a mixture of all Asian dishes, but I wouldn't have barbecue here. I think it's a little pricey for me."}
{"text":"Piggy's Restaurant?? Since I am not Korean, I just assume with this name and logo, this place is specialized in serving pigs? Or just a warning for my vegetarian friend not to venture in?  One of the disappointment is NO lunch Specials! Almost every Korean restaurants in the area has lunch specials... hmm... too late now, I am stuck here without specials!!  What should I eat? It was freaking hot outside and I saw mustard and vinegar on the table... so of course I ordered the Mul Maeng myeon ($8.95).  Nothing beat having a Korean Cold Noodle on a hot hot day!!   Don't cut my noodles, I want a good photos!!   Slurp Slurp Slurp! Making a mess...  Waiter came back with the scissors and want to cut my noodles again!  Refreshing and enjoyable... with cucumber and pear!  However, no Banchen for me? My noodles only came with some pickled turnips.... how come??  Piggy's Restaurant's prices are relatively more expensive... it is in the same price point at Sariwon up the street.. however even Sariwon has lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Went to Piggy's for the first time last night with a group of friends. The meat was high quality and the flavors were excellent and authentic. In the end it came out to about $40 with tax, tip and a few bottles of soju so it's not your average cheap kbbq. Service, while friendly, was slow. I would definitely go back when it's not so busy!"}
{"text":"This place was the same as any other Korean place you can find in the area. It was larger than most Korean places so a plus for that. However, my friend and I were not impressed by the service as it took us much longer to be seated even though there were many seats. At first, the guy at the register offered us the seat right beside the door and we kindly refused and asked if we could get a booth even if we had to wait. We were waiting and there were two tables that were gone and all they had to do was clean up the booth but it took them a while to do that.  The menu itself had a large selection of soups and meat. We ordered the Beo Seot Bul Go Gi which was pretty good. The side dishes were not that great. There were random salads served to us and a scoop of mash potato. However, I did like how they added seafood pancake as a side dish and the radish was pretty good. Rice costed extra even though at some places rice is included. They had purple rice which is always a plus.   Overall, the service was better after we got seated and the food was decent. I would come back to try the soups since they had such a large variety. Another bonus was that some famous Korean people (My favourite girl group Apink) have stopped by Piggy's during their visit to Canada so it says a lot compared to other Korean places."}
{"text":"My favourite Korean restaurant in the Markham area. I would usually order some sort of BBQ which comes in 2 servings. I definitely recommend their signature pork belly if you don't mind fatty meats."}
{"text":"Just head over there the other day ever since their renovation and man...I love it!  Piggy's is appropriate for all sorts of events whether its just a casual gathering or a business dinner. Their service is on point, not in your face too much but always there to help you out even if you don't ask.   Their table-top bbq is authentic and high quality. If you don't know how to operate this then don't worry because the employees will come to the rescue and show you. I know at first glance you may think that the table bbq is a bit pricey but I mean it when I say that you will get what you pay for because their meat really can't be compared to regular bbq places you go to.   The side dishes are also very tasty and diverse, suitable for anyone. With the Signature Pork Belly bbq we got served big portioned side dishes such as Korean pancakes, salad, beansprouts, kimchi, beef tendons and more (I can't quite remember because I was stuffing my face).   With the renovation, the decor has become even nicer and everyone who works there is sure to keep the place clean. Piggy's is a bright restaurant that's aesthetically pleasing with great quality food on top of my list of go to places.   ALSO, don't forget to check in when you go for a free can of pop (YAASS free stuff)."}
{"text":"Our new favourite in the area. No reservations for groups smaller than 8 (possibly 6). Samgyeopsal was thick and cooked up nice. Garlic beef was to die for. Side dishes tasty. Not a big fan of the new grapefruit soju though lol. Service was pretty good despite the place being always hectic and packed. Nice people. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 7 and was seated right away on a Friday 7:30pm. Despite being able to walk right into a seat, the restaurant is by no means empty. They have a great variety of items on the menu and the service is AMAZING. Super friendly, responds to requests quickly, and help cook any of your bbq meats (not just at the beginning of the meal, but they come back to check on you and will help continuously cook and cut it for you). Delicious Korean appetizers with the meal and food quality is pretty good too - but on the pricier side for kbbq (minimum required order is 2 servings for each item though...). Don't forget to check in on Yelp to get a free pop!"}
{"text":"I would give 3.5 stars for this visit. This is my first visit back to Piggy's since their renovations. I came with a couple of friends on a Friday night and luckily we didn't have to wait for a table as I heard the wait can sometimes be quite long.   The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice and airy. I noticed that there were big improvements in ventilation. Even though there was alot of grilling happening it didn't have the smoky, charred smells filling the air. It appears to have more room to accommodate larger parties and the grill space was much larger than previously prior to the renovations.   We ordered the LA Kalbi, seafood pancake to share, duck patties and beef short rib soup. The food took some time to come out and the seafood pancake and the side dishes arrived first. The seafood pancake ($17) hardly seemed worth the price as I could barely find the seafood although taste wise it was good especially with the dipping sauce provided. The LA kalbi was sooo soft and falling off the bone. It was definitely a joy to eat especially with the delicious marinade. The beef short rib soup was another winner with the hearty sweet beef flavor broth. I also liked the use of the glass noodles instead or the rice as rice tends to be overly filling.   The service was alright I guess. I understand Friday night is a busy time however the call button on the table seemed to be dysfunctional. You could press it numerous times and there would be no response and we had to flag a person down several times to place an order for takeout and it took more than 15 minutes to get the bill. Food in general was pretty good but not really spectacular and I will perhaps try to come back on a different day when it isn't so busy."}
{"text":"We ordered #45, which is marinated pork rib for two. We also added on some rice+soup and cold noodles as well. It was extremely filling so we probably didn't need to add on the cold noodles. To start he banchan here was amaaazing. There's so much of it and almost all of them were tasty. The marinated pork rib was delicious, and they give you a nice assortment of condiments to put on the lettuce wraps. The tofu soup was also pretty good. The only one I still can't get into is the cold noodles but maybe it's just not for me.   At first glance, the prices seem a bit high for Korean bbq but the quality is there and it is very, very filling."}
{"text":"Good bbq  Got that light bulb drink thingy that was cool Pretty big portions on the share stuff"}
{"text":"Second time around and went with a few of my friends. They never disappoint the pork is nicely cut and fresh and the side dishes are very generous  It was just us 3 and it was a lot of food  Pircey but will always beat Ayce kbbq"}
{"text":"What a great place for food!  Ordered their pork combo for $40 for 2 person and it was enough. Service there was friendly and quick.  Was told this place was recently renovated and now I can see why. Big enough to fit a party.  One of my top places to go"}
{"text":"This place is not a typical Korean BBQ restaurant.  It is not AYCE.  There are traditional Korean dishes such as Bimbimbap, pork bone soup and more.  We went for the grill menu.  We had bulgogi pork and pork ribs.  The meal come with the veggies (romaine lettuce, napa lettuce, cucumber and kale) and some really great sides to dress your veggie rolls.  Sides:  mashes potatoes with a hint of sweetness, kimchi, pig skin with spicy vinaigrette, lettuce kimchi, egg cake and creamy lettuce.  Here my feedback:  SERVICE  Very good.  Our appetizers were refilled all the time.  Our meats were cooked for us and  the wait stuff were friendly and nice.  QUALITY All of it was soood good.  My favourite was the ribs for the main.  My favourite appetizer was the pig skin.  OVERALL EXPERIENCE  I would return soon."}
{"text":"First off im not a fan of korean bbq, the quality of meat is usually never good, service is terrible and overall i burn my meats quite often.  Piggys has changed my view on korean bbq. The quality of meats we tried were fantastic, the service was amazing, as they attended to cooking our meat refilling our drinks and always making sure we had everything we need.  We order slices of duck, marinated beef, pork and a dak galbi which was than converted into a kimchi fried rice. The quality of everything we had was amazing.  This place was busy from the time we stepped in and i can see why!   Overall this is my favourite korean bbq restaurant ive been to in Toronto!!"}
{"text":"The wait for our table was long but well worth the wait! We ordered the marinated pork belly and some spicy fried rice, fearing that the pork belly was not enough. We were definitely wrong bc it came with a lot of sides (more than typical Korean restaurants). The food was very delicious and I'm excited to come back to try more things!"}
{"text":"First time here, came 3 times to still see the dumpster in front (renovating). Wow, quite a menu of things here! There are daily specials and lunch specials. I ordered the fermented bean paste soup with bibimbap special. Very tangy and tasty. Got a freshly fried veggie jeon (pancake) which was still hot and crispy at the ends. Banchan was good. A very filling meal but so happy to have Korean food for a change. Definitely come with a group if you want to try more things or get Korean BBQ!"}
{"text":"I got a pork bimbimbap which tasted quite bland and had less meat than I anticipated and overall less flavour...but lots of veggies which I liked!  I did enjoy the pork belly meat that we BBQ our selves and wrapped with a piece of garlic in green lettuce."}
{"text":"The beef bbq is my go to item here. They are more expensive than most other Korean bbq spots, but their meats are also of higher quality. Thicker cut, juicy, and fresh beef can definitely be found here.  I don't recommend getting the pollack fish tho.. was dry and has a lot of bones"}
{"text":"Mmm, cheese fondue and KBBQ. I can't express enough on my love for it. I'm not sure how many places in Toronto has this but Piggy's unique and following the trend from South Korea and I just can't get enough!! It's fit for two people and honestly so much food for what it's worth. On the grill there are three sides (egg, sweet corn, and melted cheese) surrounding your choice of meat (either octopus or chicken) mixed in spicy sauce and a variety of veggies. You get a side of lettuce as wraps too so make sure to eat your food with them!! It's an amazing addition. My only advice would be to scoop the cheese out as soon as it starts to bubble as it burns rather quickly.   I really like the service here, came here half hour before the dinner rush to have dinner with the Bae and the server was very accommodating in letting us know how to eat our order. He also helped us with the cooking which was great seeing as it was our first time trying it out.   For ~$48 after taxes, I'd say both of us were fairly full and greatly satisfied. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Piggy's was great. I went on a weekday night and they were still pretty busy. We were seated immediately as we had reservations. The servers were very attentive kept checking up on us (and our grilling meat) to ensure everything was alright and our food wasn't burning.   Our orders pretty much all came at the same time and our table was overflowing with all the food. The pork that we were grilling was delicious and tender.  My favourite dish was the octopus hot pot we got. I liked it not for the octopus but for the udon that came with it. It was so soft - the perfect texture for how I like my udon. The udon also absorbed the soup base quite well. However, there was barely any octopus in the hot pot. I think they could've put more to make the dish better overall.   I liked the soup base for all three dishes that we ordered; however, they did all taste the same / very similar (not sure if that's good or bad)! Regardless, it did taste good and I would recommend Piggy's if you're going in a group so you can order / share multiple dishes."}
{"text":"It was good. Expensive compared to other kbbq joints though. We had 2 servings of pork and 2 of beef. It was tasty. Bill was 120. Really loved the side salads. If I'm in the area, I might drop by but would not make the extra trip for it."}
{"text":"Piggy's Restaurant is known for using high-quality ingredients from Korea, and bringing the best traditional flavours of Korean BBQ to Toronto. All I can say is that once you try this place, Korean BBQ will never be the same again. The food here is really good.  What separates Piggy's with the competition is their quality cuts of beef, pork belly and their marinade; which you don't typically get at an \"All-You-Can-Eat\" Korean BBQ joint. Some of Piggy's popular menu items include their Chili Sauce Cold Noodles, their perfectly marbled marinated/non-marinated Beef Ribs, and their juicy Pork Belly. Other new menu items offered include their Webfoot Octopus Cheese Fondue (with cheese, egg, and sweet corn) and their Spicy Chicken with vegetables and rice cakes on a hotplate. Fair warning though, the sauce can get pretty spicy, so add some bean sprouts to help reduce the heat.  Fun Fact: The name behind the restaurant dates back to an ancient Korean proverb, where if one dreams about pigs, your life will be filled with wealth and health."}
{"text":"Love their recent renovations, the place looks a lot better now! Usually I get the signature pork belly or their spicy squid and cheese fondue, but this time I opted for the pork intestines. Although I feel that it wasn't as good as the pork belly, it was still pretty good if you are in the mood for something more fatty."}
