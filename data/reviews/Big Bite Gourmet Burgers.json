{"text":"The owner (Sri) is very friendly and the food is great. Toonie Tuesday ($2.99) for a Jr burger makes it a great deal for a mid week dinner. 

Tons of burger an side selections. The hot mayo is excellent be sure to add it to your burger."}
{"text":"The service is first class, the owner is there with a smile and talks to you while he makes the food.  A little pricey but the food is worth it and since it's not a chain its understandable.  The cheese steak there is good and the fries are fresh.  I give it a thumbs up, and I will visit again.  They also have all day breakfast too."}
{"text":"Owner is super friendly.  

Homemade Hamburgers are delicious, on a perfect sized bun.  One of the better burgers in Pickering.  Onion rings are good, would be better if homemade too.  Overall a very good experience and worth approval.  During the summer they serve Kawartha Dairy Ice Cream."}
{"text":"We've always walked by this place on our way from Global Pet Food to Sakada Sushi. We've seen the signs and specials posted outside but honestly, nothing has made us deviate from sushi. 

We received a coupon for a deal on our News Advertiser flyer and figured we'd give it a try. Neither of us thought we'd actually give up sushi for a burger but we walked in to see what the place was like. 

We both ordered a bacon cheeseburger and shared an order of fries. The condiments looked as though they had been sitting there for a while and had formed a skin on them. I was a little cautious about having the mayonnaise based sauces but I can't not have a spicy mayo on my burger. It was obviously fine because neither of us suffered any effects. 

The meat patty itself was cooked to perfection and the burger overall was delicious! As for the fries, although there was nothing 'wrong' with them, I have had better. I think they needed to be salted... or needed more salt... I don't know, they were just missing something. It doesn't matter though. The burger was definitely the star of the show and so it should be!

The service was great and the owners are really friendly. I suspect most of their business is take-away and I think we would likely do that next time as well. The restaurant isn't much to look at and feels a little rundown and greasy... not enough to deterring us from coming here again though... it'll just be a take-away. :)"}
{"text":"6 dollars tax included for a 6oz beef burger is not a bad price at all. Good portion and nice sesame bun. The burger has a nice char to it and is quite juicy, however, I do believe there is some filler in the patty, not pure beef which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. Aside from that the value is very good."}
{"text":"The food here is fresh and always very tasty! The owner is also very accommodating and makes sure you are pleased. Would highly recommend for anyone that loves burgers, hotdogs or poutine!"}
{"text":"When we want burgers we go here.  Service is very friendly and the food is always amazing. Love it"}
