{"text":"On June 24/17 , this was my 3rd time going to this place and will likely be the last. while I ordered the beef sate sub, I didn't expect the beef to be ice cold. How does this place expect to putting ice cold beef on a sub, proceed to put it through the toaster, then expect the beef to be hot? Good news, it doesn't even become remotely warm. If I wanted a 'cold cut' sub, I would of ordered one.I have been to my fair share of viet sub places here in Calgary, but this is the worst one.all other places at least put hot beef on the subs.while I didn't get full food poisoning, the next 30 hours I did manage to sit on a toilet often. While I tried 'branching' and tried a new restaurant , getting major diarrhea is just not my thing."}
{"text":"This was my first time to visit here and I must say its pretty good! I ordered for pickup and the customer service was very good and understanding of my order. No rudeness and very friendly!  When I came for pickup the spot was very comfortable and had a nice urban/modern feel!   I had the beef sate subs and it was very delicious! They offer many vegetarian options here amongst other delicious things, like bubble tea!   They have an online order system and you can just pick it up or call to order, which is very convenient!"}
{"text":"New Place in town, fast food VN sub & Pho , Bun. Do their own bread baking in the back. Very nice, clean & modern place. Sub is really good & reasonable price (8\" sate beef $4.25, cheap). I love this place for quick sub."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and if you're looking for a cheap and reasonable sub this is the place to be. I've enjoyed their sate beef sub and a couple of other subs. This last time I decided to try their pho. My recommendation is to stick to the subs. The broth was a little flavourless for me. The prices are extremely reasonable. You can't go wrong getting a sub from here. There are two sizes 8\" and 11\" and the 11\" is still under $7. Parking is plentiful. Service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"First time here, I have eaten a lot of banh mi subs in my life. This place would get a full 5 stars if they were a little less stingy with the cold cuts other than that it is an excellent spot"}
{"text":"The subs are okay. The pho is acceptable. I like the concept and that they have fresh bread for sale here. I would probably come back for takeout on a lazy day when I don't feel like cooking at home. The service is friendly and it doesn't take a while so be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes for your order."}
{"text":"I haven't had a viet sub this good in a very long time! Came here out of curiosity as I was in the neighbourhood and was so glad I did! The shop is clean and modern, and service was super quick!  I got their 11\" classic cold cut sub today and from the first bite I knew I was in love! The sub includes four different cuts of pork cold cut. Not many places do this any more, alot of times I end up with just sausage in my sub (much sad).   The sub toppings were perfectly balanced, and veggies were seasoned just right! I don't know how much more perfect this sub could have been! The bread was the perfectly toasted, so no cuts at the roof of my mouth to deal with tonight. I was able to eat the whole sub, as there wasn't too much sauce, and therefore it stayed crispy to the very last bite.   What wins it for me is that it lasted the 30 minutes drive home and it still tasted fabulous! Totally a must try on my list, and will for sure be back to try their satays and \"boon togo\"."}
{"text":"WOW!! This place is very very good for the price! I highly recommend the bulgogi sandwich because combining Korean BBQ and the already infamous Vietnamese sandwich is such a smart move. The meat is super tender and goes very well with the kimchi and pickled carrots! VERY GOOD!!"}
{"text":"My first experience here was very good. The place is very clean and the atmosphere was good.   There are a lot of vegetarian options, I tried the kimchi & tofu sub. It was very tasty and had a good amount of sauce.  The service was very friendly and fast. I would recommend this place because of the quality of food for a great price."}
{"text":"Good place to eat if you like rotten produce. Four  jalapenos on my sub. Two of them were rotten. No attention to detail. Those two jalapeno slices lost a customer for ever."}
