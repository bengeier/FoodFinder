{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place so I drove all the way from the East for the hearty French Toast breakfast and it didn't disappoint me ! The staffs there are friendly! The highlight was definitely the French Toast. The portion is really huge! Everything is tasty and I definitely will come back for it."}
{"text":"Praline, banana, caramel French Toast!!

I expected a lot and Sunny Morning delivered! 

Seat yourself wherever you would like! Looking around the room everyone's plate looked to be delicious.  I went with the French toast and was not disappointed! 

I was surprised how many people showed up solo to order their favorite breakfast dish. 

If you are looking for a breakfast spot this is a no brainer. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly staff, clean place, food portions are very big, orange juice was fresh. Definitely a place to come back."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great place to have no only breakfast but food in general. The burgers tastes so good and the salad is so fresh. I just noticed that they added a new Nutella menu which I am desperately to try. This is definitely my \"to go\" place when I just want to have a top quality food and a top service. Keep it going guys!"}
{"text":"Such a pleasure is going to this place and having an excellent meal and a amazing service. I recommend Sunny Morning 100% if you want to have quality food for a good price. Worths it."}
{"text":"During an afternoon hunt for a breakfast spot on Yonge street, I came across an adorable restaurant called \"Sunny Mornings\" located on Yonge and St Clair, I was blown away with the service and the delicious food I was served. Though the restaurant may be a bit small, it is big on taste. I had the Eggs Benedict and I can honestly say this was by far the best hollondaise sauce I ever had!!! My girlfriend had a chicken sandwich which she also loved. To finish the meal we got French toast topped with fresh fruit and Nutella and it was scrumptious. We highly recommend this spot whether it's lunch or breakfast you can't go wrong. We plan to go again.  P.s. They have real Tobasco hot sauce!"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and the food was good. There was a nice variety of choice in terms of breakfast and lunch. My only complaint is that the food was Luke warm. It was still delicious but I wish it had've been hot. I would definitely give it another try."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Everyone there is very friendly and looks like the genuinely happy to be there.  You get a good amount of food for what you pay for.  The food is fresh and isn't greasy.  And the pancakes are sooo fluffy! :)

You gotta go there!"}
{"text":"I thought this was a great place to get a basic breakfast. VERY hearty portions, friendly service, and great prices. For $10, you can get 2 slices of french toast, 3 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, 2 sausages, and a generous serving of home fries -- which is great value. The coffee was better than I would have expected from a place like this."}
{"text":"It was so crowded, a lot of people there, and we waited in line for almost 15-20 minutes. There were so good reviews about it, so I thought it should be really good, but It was just OK! 
The brunch was really normal brunch, nothing special about it. The ventilation there was awful. The kitchen was open so it smelled like eggs everywhere. And I was worried that my winter coat would stink after getting out of the place. 
The service was not so good. We asked for bread without butter, so the waitress just grabbed out buttered bread with bare hands and left! After maybe 5 minutes, she came back with some different breads. I didn't feel so clean there!"}
{"text":"one of my go to brunch places in the north york area. service is fast and food is relatively good."}
{"text":"Great service, got a seat fairly quickly for a Sunday morning, good portions, great staple breakfast food -bacon was a bit salty for my taste and the home fries weren't as crispy as I would have liked."}
{"text":"Really loved this place! Excellent service as you walk in. Excellent waitress and good food. Portions are really big and still have a great taste. Will definitively come back!"}
{"text":"Service 5/5, food 4.9/5

Fantastic brunch here, cant find anything wrong in food and service. Even if i have to pick something bad i cant think of any i am afraid. Food are not greasy, homefries taste very good! It doesnt give you the wow factor since its breakfast food we have been eating all our lives but is exceptionally good. Will be back for sure. Thanks"}
{"text":"Host was rude and their drink policy is ridiculous. We had just grabbed a coffee and were hoping to eat here. As we waited for a table and we're finally seated, we were advised of the outside drink policy. We complied with their request, but then they tried to charge us for their own coffee, JUST to use their cup!  Never again will I return here and just be aware of the shoddy service."}
{"text":"Often in Toronto I feel like I can't find that suburban greasy spoon type of breakfast place. Sometimes that's all you feel like. Sunny Morning is a pretty decent replicate of that. Everything is OK and the portions are huge and heavy. Don't come here if you're on a diet."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place about a week ago. What a delightful place! The food was delicious and freshly made but what really struck us were the staff. They were very attentive and friendly and they looked like they really enjoy what they do. So refreshing to feel like they give a damn that you're there! That's what made us go back this morning and that's what will keep us going back!"}
{"text":"Huge portions.  Nothing particularly exciting, and Toronto has so many delicious options to choose from.  I wouldn't not go back, I just wouldn't go there if I knew of another open place."}
{"text":"We went to Sunny Morning on Sunday for brunch. The place was very busy but we didn't have to wait long for a seat. I found the staff to be very friendly and provided excellent service. The food was amazing and I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Standard breakfast fare! I had the early riser special which is 3 eggs, side of bacon ham or sausage, toast, side of salad, home fries or tomatoes for $5.99. And that includes coffee!  Awesome deal. 

Servers were very nice and attentive. Place is pretty clean, too. Would recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place so I decided to try it out. This place deserves my 5 star rating. I ordered the Peameal Bacon & Eggs with Home fries and my wife had the Peameal Bacon & Eggs with a side order of fruit. The eggs, bacon and Home fries was cooked to perfection. The Size of the Bacon slices were huge and definitely worth every penny. My wife's side order of fruit was fresh and delicious. I highly recommend this place. It's now my favourite all day breakfast restaurant. And oh... They have an amazing lunch menu as well. Bon Appetite !"}
{"text":"Reliable brunch staple that rarely disappoints.

We have been here many times, they are always busy but the wait is usually within 30 mins. With their recent expansion, there was no wait even though we arrived at 1pm.

Their dishes are great bang for buck with full plate of fruit /salad as a side, and the entree is very generous as well. The only dishes that we didn't love in the past are their pancakes, waffles. They were not very fluffy or flavourful as other brunch places."}
{"text":"Hmmm. I was really expecting to absolutely love this place based on the reviews and things my friends had told me but I am left a tad dissapointed...

So first off, and I don't know if this is because this is a relatively new restaurant but it was extremely busy and a pretty long waiting time to get seated, order food, and be served.  Usually this isn't a big deal but I thought it was a bit TOO long, as opposed to a place like Dundas Street Grille where there are often waits for breakfast but they are much shorter and the service is much quicker.

I got the smoothie and the nutella strawberry banana pancakes.  The smoothie was decently good although I didn't really like how there is only one type of smoothie you can get, you can't choose what fruits go into it etc.  The 3 pancakes were large and topped with lots of strawberries and bananas but had an extremely thin coating of nutella that I could barely taste it :( which was disappointing...overall I just didn't find the meal pleasing for the wait.  My bf got a bacon egg and cheese sandwich with hash browns which looked ok but he said it wasn't amazing compared to DSG which he said he likes better.

I'm sure I will be back one day in the future to try something else on the menu and maybe at a different time.  I had really high hopes for this place to become my new go-to Etobicoke breakfast spot but I think that still remains as DSG."}
{"text":"As all-day breakfast places go, the menu has a lot of variety on it, and the food is definitely super delicious. Our waitress was terrific, attentive, and friendly. The washrooms are very small! I'm knocking half a star off for the overly salty bacon and another half star for the one-ply toilet paper."}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast for reasonable price, perfect service, delicious and quality food. I had The Lumberjack and the Nutella Dream Waffles and I licked my fingers :) It was just great!"}
{"text":"I have had both breakfast and lunch at the Etobicoke location.

Both times my friends and I all had meals that we were happy with both in terms of quality and value for $.  

Personally, I  love their bacon, something I rarely say for restaurant meals.

Salad and fruit really is fresh!

Service friendly and efficient.  Kathleen wore fabulous fried egg ear rings showing her enthusiasm for breakfast!

My only suggestion is that there is the flexibility to serve a half salad and half home fries combination for side selection."}
{"text":"They run a clean, organized restaurant. Rating on Yelp was higher than we thought justified. Size portion was reasonable. Service was on point. Servers were peppy and brought us everything we needed. There are better breakfast specialty restaurants out there. 
Nutella waffles were the stand out. Classic breakfast was adequate, and the Eggs Benny with \"ham\" was just good. No surprises but fair."}
{"text":"Great range of possibilities and awesome breakfast !! Only problem is that helpings are too generous, indeed!! It's sad to see how much food per person is thrown away and not even taken away.. Really not good to see"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to go when I want to drop off the health wagon and indulge in a nice, well-served ordinary classic North American breakfast like the old \"greasy spoons\" used to serve, - - and that IS a compliment."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I both got sick after eating the eggs Benedict. Maybe it was just an off morning for that particular order or for the kitchen, but the food felt a bit greasy and generic."}
{"text":"There is nothing sunny about this place. Its the darkest place I ve ever seen, no windows. Very small and the breakfast was nothing special. Just the pancakes with nutella and strawberry was good. But the ambiance was very bad. I'd never go that place again. I'd go to Sunset grill or Fran's and pay cheaper and have a decent breakfast."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday at 10:30am and was quickly seated.  The place is decently open and decorated but the seating is pretty tight.  I hope you like your neighbours because you will be close to them unless you are in a booth.

The food is okay, nothing to write home about.  I also found a hair in my home fries, so I guess I'm not the only one that had this happen.

The value is definitely there with the main breakfast dishes being roughly $11-$12, coffee was an additional $2 although it does come with refills.  At $12, I ordered the meat lovers omelette and I couldn't even finish half of it.  The sizes are pretty massive.

Overall, I don't think it is a bad place, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"Now there's a reason to wake up in the morning on weekends!!!! 
Great portions, great food, friendly staff. 
5 stars all round!"}
{"text":"My Grandma & I wanted to try a new breakfast spot and we found Sunny Mornings. It did not disappoint. We will definitely be going again. 

We went a little after 1p after the breakfast rush which was probably in our favour."}
{"text":"When I got there I thought it was a busy small place an as soon as I gave my name to get a table I had to wait only 5 minutes!!! 
Service was amazing!!!! The food was to die for!! 
Is the place I would go every morning and expect just the best!!!! 
I tried the Freddy waffle and it was the best waffle I have ever tried."}
{"text":"Food was amazing , but the service was second to none. My wallet is fearing how much I want tip the staff."}
{"text":"We had a great experience,  food was tasty and staff were very friendly,  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, good quality and friendly environment.

From the moment you arrive at Sunny Morning you are guaranteed a fantastic experience. I believe I mentioned before, I absolutely adore Sunny Morning and go there any chance I have.  The food is perfect every single time, and the staff is always warm and friendly, always providing service with a smile.  Excellent, excellent service, efficient and hospitable.

While everything on the menu is very good, Sunny Morning offers a wide range of choices and they also have great specials.  The real standout here are the breakfast omelets, I love all of them, yummy... Also the coffee is always lovely (perfect for my taste) , and the soup of the day is always outstanding.  The atmosphere and the ambiance of the restaurant are great.

Great price, great quality, very fresh and unbelievably flavorful. This is by far one of the best breakfasts/brunch/lunch places in Toronto. I can't wait to come back to try other items on the menu."}

So much better now that they've expanded.
The staff is always welcoming and very polite.
The prices are a little bit higher than other breakfast and brunch places but yu definitely get your moneys worth."}
{"text":"It seems they have lifted the ban on substitutions and will allow them again which is great. The food quality is still a little so-so but overall we like the atmosphere and the selection and the service. It's still the quickest place to get eggs in this area."}
{"text":"Katherine and I have been to Sunny Morning on the Queensway three times now, and the experience has always been excellent. Good food, and lots of it, served up with fast and friendly service.

This morning, I finally decided to have my own plate of Eggs Freddy (Eggs Benedict) after sampling tastes of Katherine's on previous visits. Heavenly! The eggs are cooked perfectly, sitting atop some of the most tender peameal bacon it has ever been my pleasure to munch. The hollandaise sauce was rich and flavourful. The tomato slices which accompanied my eggs were crisp and juicy. I have had the home fries here on a previous visit and know them to be just as good as everything else that hits the table here.

It would be easy to miss this place, hiding across the parking lot from the Canadian Tire, but it's worth making the effort, because this is one of the best brunch places in this part of town."}
{"text":"These guys have changed ownership a few times now. Food is pretty good. Chefs are fabulous folk and friendly. 
Wish they had more veg options as they did in the past though. 
There's a great host, don't know his name, skinny guy, super efficient and professional, upbeat. 
Unimpressed with the recent new girl up front who's known for lecturing peeps a bit :( kinda pretentious and drops the appetite after dealing with her.  When it comes to eggs you want a place that's relaxed with real characters. If there's one thing I can't stand with breakfast, it's fake friendliness :("}
{"text":"We were visiting from Denver Colorado and it was the day we're going back home, we looked for a breakfast place before we go to the airport, searched on yelp for the highest rated breakfast restaurant and ended up there. You seat yourself, then toy get served with whatever you order fairly quickly, delicious eggs and omelette, very reasonable prices, the owner stopped by our table to make sure everything was good, liked the atmosphere. Recommended"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast spot. There was a bit of a line up but it moved fast and within ten minutes we were at a table. Delicious breakfast platter. Eggs were soft and tasty. Potatoes were out of the world. My only complaint was that some items on the menu are no longer available, but they  don't tell you until after the substitution is made. 

I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Najlepsze miejsce w ca?ym GTA  jedzenie super . Pracownicy bardzo mili I pomocni . Sa?atki smaczne . Pierwszy raz odwiedzi?em to miejsce 2 tygodnie temu I od tego czasu prawie codziennie tam bywam . Bardzo polecam . Warto odwiedzic . Ceny niskie w stosunku do jakosci I ilo?ci ."}
{"text":"Had the caramel waffle with bananas and pecans. They're absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the atmosphere also very breakfasty. It is a must visit place if you are looking for western style breakfast. Orange juice was awesome. 

I would prefer this place over coras any day of the year since the taste is so much better."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go breakfast. Compared to other places that I've been you can feel that everything is really fresh. The price is good for the big portions and it has very good options to try different things every day (though I tend to go for the traditional breakfasts and specialties. 

If you read this keep the good work. You have gained a regular here.  :)

By the way, keep hiring great staff as you're doing. It makes a great place to keep going."}
{"text":"Excellent value. Fresh ingredients. Tried the hamburger... great seasoning...a little on the big side...but no complaints here..."}
{"text":"The food is great. Traditional breakfast but full of taste. The staff is friendly and the management helpful and they go out of their way to make you feel in a neighborhood business as opposed to a chain. Prices are more than reasonable and potions are more than I can eat."}
{"text":"Here's just a little update.  We haven't had the time to make it back in yet but we will ... I changed my three star review from before because out of all the times we've gone it's been excellent and one incident happened but that's life. I appreciated the owner taking the time to message me and fix things and I know he cares a lot about his business because literally every single time we've gone there he's been running around working just as hard as his employees . So I'll keep my rating 5 star.
I'd still recommend 






Went for breakfast this afternoon hoping to miss a bit of the rush.  It was still busy but I was still expecting to have decent service. We had French toast no syrup was brought had to ask someone because we didn't see our server.  Our water and coffee was never refilled once. We ate our entire meal without a drink. Then our bill for 4 people having breakfast was 70.75$ we went up to pay our bill we left about 85$ ..70$ in bills and toonies and loonies.. instead of using change we left for the .75 cents the guy at the cash ran outside after us saying we owed .75 cents... embarrassing and also why wouldn't u take it out of the money we left? Honestly the girl didn't even deserve that much tip but they couldn't deduct .75 cents from it and actually ran after us outside in front of everyone . 

This is the first time we've had a bad experience but for a expensive breakfast I'll probably go somewhere else next time. Great food but turned off from there for a bit"}
{"text":"If there were a \"minus star\", I would rate this new establishment as that! We attempted brunch on a weekend and had to stand sufferably in line waiting for what seemed ages while watching patrons seated in nice booths having a great time devouring what appeared to be the ordinary breakfast dishes. When we were summoned by our hostess and led down the aisle of comfy-looking booths, my spirits elevated in anticipation of a new adventure in breakfast/brunch eateries. However, they plummeted as did my face when I saw our destination......a  large room full of people packed in like sardines, each one chomping and shouting at each other in order to be heard above the din. We were placed at a tiny table for two with little elbow room from our neighbours but we saw that there were a few booths along the perimeter so we asked if we could have one that was just being cleared. The cordial answer was \"Yes of course!\" but the server returned and informed us that the booth was for 4 people not just 2. We looked at each other and grabbed our coats and promptly left. C'mon, the menus exhibited the usual breakfast/brunch fare at ridiculous high prices so shouldn't we at least get reasonable seating where the servers don't have to run an obstacle course to reach your table? I guess this shoddy experience is to be expected with the increase in minimum wage and high overhead at a prime location. Oh well, it's back to Mom 'n Pops hidden eateries in Newmarket I go, with glee, I add!"}
{"text":"we went there this morning and I realize it was Mother's Day morning and a lot of places were busy
we waited at the door for what seemed unusually long time and were totally ignored by the staff who kept walking by accept for one of the cooks who smiled at us and there were empty seats 
yet they smiled and said hi to people that came in after us asked them how many were in their party etc perhaps regulars
we felt invisible
finally a waiter took us to a table and I smiled and thanked her but she just looked at me with absolutely no expression
so I just said to my friend \"let's just leave\" I didn't want to eat there
there is nothing I hate more than an unfriendly place and I refuse to give them my business"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and great food! The kids menu was perfect for our four year old who INHALED the French toast and fruit. This our new fav breakfast spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicioso super variado y muy natural se siente tan fresco como en casa...Los precios muy accesibles muy recomendable deben de visitarlo en Toronto"}
{"text":"I was disappointed - primarily due to the service. After giving up on our waitress to take our breakfast order, I asked the gal who was filling up water glasses if she could ask the waitress to stop by, She reluctantly agreed. While we were waiting for our breakfast to cook, our waitress topped other diner's coffee mugs but ignored us. When the food arrived, my dry unbuttered tasteless bagel was not accompanied by pads of butter or jam so I got up from my table and asked the waitress for some, I didn't eat more than half my breakfast because I wasn't enjoying the food. While we were waiting in the lineup to pay the bill, I saw many plates of uneaten food."}
{"text":"Very solid average. Same breakfast as any dinner anywhere- unremarkable in every respect... even having to ask twice for a refill on average coffee. We had a wide selection of everything and it was all unsurprising... and average."}
{"text":"Sunny Morning offers great value for the money with traditional home cooked breakfasts. The portions are huge and the service is very friendly and attentive.  If you are looking for a great breakfast place this is it!"}
{"text":"Breakfast has never been a disappointment at this location. Staff are extremely friendly and very accommodating to me and my stroller. We have made this place a weekly ritual. Usually order the eggs florentine and my boyfriend will get a big breakfast."}
{"text":"If I could rate this restaurant 0 stars, I would. 

I was meeting a friend for brunch one morning and arrived a bit earlier than she did, so naturally I decided to wait in line for a table as the restaurant was quite busy. When I finally got to the front of the line I was asked if I needed a table for one or if I was meeting someone. I told the waitress I was meeting a friend who was on her way. She informed me that she would have to seat those standing in line behind me because they were here and my friend was not. I said my friend was almost here, but instead of seating me at a table and offering me coffee while I waited for my friend, she said that I would have to wait until my friend got here to be seated. 

Eventually, the many groups of people in line behind me had all been seated and there were still 2 tables available. I assumed that I would be seated now that there was no one else waiting in line. Instead of seating me, the waitress decided to talk to another waitress at the coffee station about how she can't cook and her boyfriend won't eat any of the food she makes. I continued to think that she would seat me, now that there were available tables, but she didn't even acknowledge that I was still waiting. 

At this point I was tempted to leave, but I decided to give the food a chance. When my friend arrived I ordered the eggs Benjamin and my friend ordered an omelette and asked for a coffee as well. The coffee never came, but was still on the bill. When we told the waitress that the coffee never came, she just laughed and said, \"oh that's right, you didn't get coffee,\" before deducting it from our bill. Unfortunately the food was very disappointing as well. The smoked salmon on my eggs Benjamin was incredibly salty and full of bones! A large bone was momentarily lodged in my throat.  I couldn't even finish the smoked salmon as it was pretty much inedible. 

This was a very disappointing experience due to the horrible service and food and I will not be returning to Sunny Morning, or should I say Gloomy Morning."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food and service are excellent. 

But a tad on the pricey side. Why not include coffee or tea as part of the meal?"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp after doing a search for a breakfast place near Sherway Gardens and I got excited with all the ratings.  No wait, that's a lie - it was the frequent mention of Nutella on the menu that caught my eye. Although I had my heart set on something with Nutella, I opted for their Eggs Freddy.  

Eggs Freddy (aka Eggs Benny) - You get the usual 2 English muffins with peameal bacon and poached eggs.  I had completely forgotten to mention how I like my eggs nor did the waitress ask but I was pleasantly surprised when the eggs were poached perfectly, runny.  The hollandaise sauce was good and wasn't overly yolky or lemony.  I thought it was just right.  With my eggs benny, I got their golden home fries which were pretty good.  A little on the starchier side but I liked how it wasn't fried, but rather baked.  Overall platter gets a rating of 4/5.

Bacon - My friend and I got a side of bacon and I was a little disappointed with the bacon. I know, right?!  That's just wrong to even say and admit.  I found it a little on the chewier side.  It reminded me of chewing on some beef jerky, to be honest, though it wasn't that bad.  I'd probably still order it though just to give it another shot. 3.5/5.  

Freddy's Caramel French Toast - I'm pretty picky with my french toast so this wasn't my first pick, but my friend's.  I must say though that theirs was actually quite good.  Minus the super sweet caramel, the toast itself was nicely battered and grilled; it wasn't too dry which is one of the main mistakes when making french toast. A little too sweet for my tastebuds but if you have a sweet tooth, then this would be a great choice. It was also a very generous serving. 4/5."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Classic brunch dishes done well.

First off, it's not the easiest place to find... It's located in the plaza with the Canadian Tire, but the sign facing the Queensway is pretty small. Once you've turned into the plaza, it's off to the right, in the first strip of storefronts (if I recall correctly).

I ordered the French Delight (2 pieces of french toast, 3 eggs, 2 sausages, 2 strips of bacon) with a side of fruit (which cost an extra $2.49, but I wasn't in the mood for home fries, salad, or tomato slices.) The french toast was OK - it was nice and crispy on the outside, but I think it needed more time in the egg mixture, because the inside was D-R-Y. The bacon was nice thick-cut bacon, but it was overcooked (in my opinion.) Eggs and sausage were standard issue.

The restaurant itself is bright and a little bit country and a little bit modern. The servers are super nice and service is quick.

Overall I think it's a nice place for brunch. If you like Cora's, but want to switch it up once in awhile, this is a solid choice."}
{"text":"Great service, and more importantly awesome food. I had an egg white western that was fluffy and steaming hot, usually egg white omelets can be a little flat. Will most definitely come back for another breakfast when in the area."}
{"text":"Customer service decent, prices OK, menu selection quite decent as is the quality of the food for the most part.

M'lady and I decided to try this all day breakfast venue, and we ended up with mixed feelings about it.

There was a cat hair in my meal, and eggs inconsistently cooked on m'lady's dish.

All-in-all, I might try it again, but it wouldn't be the first place I'd pick for breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Now that they've expanded this place, I like it even better. The wait to grab seats was quick, even on a Saturday morning. If you can get it, get the croissant French toast. I had no idea perfection existed in this world until I discovered this beauty. Smothered in Nutella, almonds, strawberries and whipped cream it was delicious and worth the money. Coffee is hot, decent and topped up often. What more can you ask for? Wait staff is super efficient and just the right amount of perky for a hung over weekend morning."}
{"text":"Amazing bacon!!!! Do I need to say anything else? Actually, there is nothing negative I can say about my recent visit here. The scrambled eggs were fluffy. The potatos were tasty and not deep fried to death. The menu has tons of options to choose from. And of course their bacon was to die for.  Service was super friendly and attentive. It was definitely a Sunny Morning!"}
{"text":"Tried it this morning.
The food was good but have to comment on the home fries....it was so burnt that the color was BLACK on 1 side of each piece of home fries.
Understand the potato was fried with skin but still....serving something that was burnt to black?
If you look at the photos that have been posted previously you would see it too, except when you see in person it's much more black. I commented on that to the server and of course she just smiled and ignored me. So, I figure I would put this on Yelp so people would know what to expect."}
{"text":"This new breakfast & Lunch spot was excellent. The place was jammed back upon arrival but we were seated in less than 10 minutes. 
A waiter arrived right away. A menu was offered as we waited in line so ordering was quick. 
The men went with the eggs and various meat breakfast and the women the large fruit piled Belgian waffle and the Sweet Dreams French toast. 
The fruit is prepare fresh every morning. I really didn't even need syrup. 
There was not a drop of food left on anyone's plate in the end. 

Excellent"}
{"text":"This homely breakfast spot is bustling with very friendly and attentive servers. I like that the place is small, so you'll never have trouble flagging down your server.

The menu is pretty standard - various combinations of pancakes, eggs, bennys and omelettes. I ordered the Eggs Freddy - poached eggs over peameal bacon & English muffin. The eggs were nice & runny and the bacon was bigger than the english muffin, talk about huge portions. The unfortunate part of my dish was the potatoes that were quite burnt. 

My friend really enjoyed his Lumberjack order - I took a piece of his pancake, and it was super fluffy! This also comes with three eggs (any style), two bacon, two sausage links and a mountain of home fries. 

I'd say Sunny Morning has the same quality as Coras, but charges on average $1-2 less. Me and my friend spent under $30 - great value! 

3.5 Stars!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times - once with my gf and the other two with my husband.

The first time I came here I had breakfast - I always feel like the mark of a good breakfast place is their eggs benedict and this one did not disappoint. Generous with the eggs done perfectly.

The second time it was lunch and I was craving a burger.. Mmm so good. cooked perfectly and I had mine with salad.

The third time I was running errands trying to get a surprise bd party pulled together and I need a little something. Started with mimosa's and had the most perfect grilled cheese which they added sliced tomatoes to.

Will be going back for sure!!"}
{"text":"We decided to come to sunny morning with the family. We were greeted and seated promptly. We were given a highchair for our daughter. The restaurant is small, yet clean and organized.

There was plenty of waitstaff and they were very friendly and courteous. We would recommend and come back."}
{"text":"It was a great experience. Never been to Toronto before,but this is the place to eat. Not a long wait, very good food, polite service. Next time I'm in Toronto,I will be back here."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. We went there 2 times and then thought we would take our 2 kids the 3rd time and it was great. They loved it also. Food Great staff good but very busy. Not a lot of time for chitchat as they r so busy. If u r lucky enough to get a seat. If not wait... its worth it. Sizes are BIG... wish it was closer to Yonge/ Lawrence.  Hey maybe u could open another spot around there lol. We would love that."}
{"text":"It was an okay brunch place. Its not that pleasing of an environment. Kinda small but very popular. And the omelettes are rly good, but the pancakes not the best ive had. Overall 4 star cuz it tasted good and it was fine, but not a brunch place to be super excited for."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my breakfast here. Got the daily special: creamed salmon with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce and cream cheese,b ordered the potatoes/fries as the side. Not sure it was the best choice for breakfast, but it wasn't bad. Hollandaise and eggs were great. Fish was fine, but could have done without it. Glad I tried it though. Staff were friendly. Place was quaint, busy, but friendly and welcoming. Business led to some difficulty maneuvering, but it's to be expected. Prices weren't too bad; left full for $20. Coffee was adequate, but nothing special (better than Tim's). I'd definitely go back, but might try a more traditional meal. Bathrooms were downstairs. One per gender, so possibility of a wait, though I did not experience it."}
{"text":"Yonge and St. Clair needed a breakfast place so badly !! Although the place is new the food has the taste and quality of a seasoned old time grill and the poached eggs come soft poached as they should !! My only wish that this place stayed open passed 3PM as I love breakfast for dinner ~"}
{"text":"Everything here is HUGE!!  From the food selection on the menu, to the actual portions, to the huge smiles on my server and hostess' faces!  I thoroughly enjoyed my brunch here!  I had the smoked salmon egg sunny and it was delish!  I upgraded to the fruit side which was totally worth it because they give you a big side bowl with a variety of fruits (unlike other places that just give you cantaloupe and a slice of banana ).  My only beef was that the fruit milkshake and coffee were mehhh...hence the 4 stars.  Great breakfast spot for curing hangovers!!"}
{"text":"Sunny Morning reminds me of a Cora's, although I don't think they are a chain. I had the Eggs Benedict and it was tasty and fresh, but didn't really taste like a homemade breakfast.

I couldn't put my finger on it to begin with, but the boxes of \"Knorr Hollandaise Sauce Mix\" in the basement might have something to do with it. Having said that, $10 each plus tax for brunch really isn't bad.

In terms of service, we were seated quickly and the food came fast, but our server didn't check in on us at all after that, and we had to pay at the cash on the way out. A bit disappointing."}
{"text":"My wife found this place on Yelp when looking for a spot to grab breakfast on the way home from Toronto. Seems to be a local spot and they advertise that they only use fresh local ingredients. My wife ordered a classic breakfast with bacon, I ordered a meat lovers omelet.

Man oh man, I cannot say enough good about this breakfast but I'll start with my wife's. She said her scrambled eggs were great and they gave her about a month's worth of bacon. Seriously, it was five massive strip of bacon, probably the biggest I've ever seen in my life. I had a slice because she couldn't finish and it was amazing.

The omelet I received was one of the largest I've ever seen in my life. It stood about an inch tall and was incredibly fluffy. The meat lovers omelet came with sausage, bacon, and peameal bacon, which all tasted great. I also had an oj, which had a fair amount of pulp. The \"brown\" toast was just thicker cut wheat toast but very good, great jelly too.

Overall I thought this place was phenomenal and incredibly reasonably priced. Also, the food was cooked and delivered super fast. From the time we ordered to the time we got our food was less than 10 minutes, I promise I'm not exaggerating, I was legitimately amazed. I would come back here again and again 10/10."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Sunny morning sort of places in an unsuspecting area of etobicoke just down the street from sherway. Great for morning or brunch. 
I got an omelette, and for dessert our table of 8 ordered the nutella dream waffle. Delish! Not too sweet, made just right. Bottomless coffee and ample parking!

{"text":"Last weekend, thanks to a friend, I discovered this place, and now it's part of my favourites. First of all, let me tell you the service is fast, and everybody is super friendly; they came first to get our drink order, and gave us some minutes to decide.

We arrived around lunch time, and I ordered the club sandwich while he wanted something sweet... a waffle!

Let's start with the sandwich: the portion is very generous, the bread is toasted to perfection, the chicken breast is fresh and has a lot of flavour, and the bacon... oh, boy... this sandwich was awesome, and to top if off, I ordered the optional fruit side... big, and very fresh... well worth the upgrade.

Now, my friend's waffle... big... well, no... it was actually huge, very well cooked, and loaded with bananas, pecans, caramel milk and whipped cream... I actually had to try it because it looked great, and it didn't disappoint at all.

Now, I need to come back one day, and try the breakfast menu; several people were ordering from this menu, and the dishes looked spectacular, and again... big!

To recap: fast and friendly service, very casual and relaxed restaurant, and very generous portions, but not only that, but the food is actually really good, and makes you wanna wish the weekend was longer so you could come back and try another dish!"}
{"text":"Service here is fantastic. The staff is so lovely to speak with and they really seem to take pride in their business. 

The breakfast is good I wouldn't say anything special about it but it is very reasonably priced and portions are well sized."}
{"text":"Based on fellow Yelpers, I had very high expectations for this place but I came away slightly disappointed. Nothing wrong with the food, but it felt like we were at a Cora's (again, nothing wrong with that). Portions were generous, but a bit pricier than other comparable places. Service was friendly and attentive.  Very family friendly and ample seating. Overall pleasant experience, but I would have to disagree with the 4.5 star Yelp average."}
{"text":"While in the Toronto area, I looked up some reviews and Sunny Morning had some pretty good ones. It did NOT disappoint. Dinnerish feel, nothing fancy about the place located in a strip mall next to a huge Bed, Bath and Beyond. Service was fast and friendly, our waitress checked up on us often. Had a waffle that was nice and fluffy and presented nicely. All their plates were nice looking. Fruits were all fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have declared this place as our place. We love coming here but apparently so do a lot of people because it's small but always busy. Our neighbours love it too, and for good reason. It's cozy, the staff are respectful, quick, and super friendly but not in a lingering way, just crazy efficient. I almost always get the eggs benny, which is delicious, and the fruit here is always always ALWAYS fresh. No day old refrigerated slices here. 
They have a pretty decent selection, not so many things that you get confused, but the staples are hit and done well. Prices are reasonable so I don't know why we're not here every week."}
{"text":"Arrived around 12pm on Sunday after finding out another brunch spot was a 45 minute wait. The restaurant was also very busy. Lots of people were waiting in the doorway to be seated. There was a staff member taking down names for the wait list as well as seating patrons. I found it hard to tell who had already put their names on the list so I approached the staff member and gave my name. I didn't realize that there was actually a group of 4 waiting who hadn't given their name yet. Anyway since we were only 2 people we were seated right away. We were handed menus immediately and our server came to take our drink order. A nice touch to the restaurant is having someone walk around to refill empty coffee cups. We didn't even have to ask. They have lots of standard breakfast options. Someone next to us ordered waffles that looked delicious. Sunny mornings is a great choice for breakfast/brunch. 
Note: I've come here with my family for Mother's Day brunch with 6 people and waited only 20 minutes. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Brunch is difficult to mess up. I could make brunch at home but for me to spend money to eat out for bacon and eggs is for the experience. And this restaurant was an experience indeed. This review is for two items I had: Sausage 'N Eggs and Just The Pancakes.

The good: sausages were fine and eggs were fine. The interior is rather modern and an overall good atmosphere.

The bad: the home fries are supposed air fried as a healthy alternative. Better alternative is to skip it entirely. It was dry and tasteless. 

The Worst: Pancakes were awful. Sure the pancakes look nice in the second photo. But it was very dry and two generous douses of syrup disappeared because the pancakes absorbed it all. Worst of all, the most burnt pancake was flipped so you can't see the burnt side. See third photo. BAD. Can't even spend the 25 cents to make another one?

Overall, I do not recommend this place. If you are starving for food, Ikea is down the street. Eat there."}
{"text":"Wedged in between a Popeye's Supplement store and a hair salon called Sports Clips buried in the Canadian Tire, Lowes, Bed Bath Beyond I came across this little ray of sunshine on a slightly hungover Sunny (Sunday) Morning.

It might not look big from the outside but this tiny gourmet diner is huge and packed with a big heart (not too mentioned more breakfast goodies to stop yours). It's the second of two locations to be opened in this independently owned breakfast chain (the other being south of Yonge and St. Clair).

it's got all your basic breakfast staples; eggs, bacon, omelets, scrambles, etc with the added bonus of mouthwatering waffles and pancakes. Each having their own section of the menu that showcases how amazing the selection is. 

I went with the Lumberjack breakfast which was: 3 eggs, 2 sausage, 2 bacon and choice of special side (tomato, bowl of fruit, hash-brown potatoes, etc) and two of their pancakes. The pancakes were thick and fluffy, perfectly cooked on each side and definitely the star of this dish, but what made it even better was that they allowed us (for a small fee) to have our included pancakes made up like their specialty pancakes. I went with the Funky Monkey which added pecans, bananas and whipped cream to these already fluffy-delicious pancakes. My sister did something similar except she subbed her regular french toast for Nutella French toast topped with almonds, strawberries and bananas.

Now I'd expect that service here would be as it is at most places - standard, bare minimum, get ya in, get ya out, turn over, etc, etc. My mistake, our server - who resembled a mix of Paul Rudd and Adam Levine (Ladies take note) was an absolute gem. He was cordial, easy going, laughed at our crappy jokes (but a real laugh not a fake one) and when we he brought our order told us that everyone in the restaurant was jealous of what we were about to eat. I mean like JUST TOPS!

I'm a firm believer that a tip is earned, it should not be assumed, and in saying that if a server meets my expectations I typically tip 15%. If I feel they are really great I'll go 18%. In this instance I tipped our celebrity doppelganger all-star 20% and made sure I told the manager/owner how amazing the server was when I went to the counter to pay. THAT GOOD!

If you're out on The Queensway doing some shopping and need to stop for breakfast, brunch or lunch, stop into Sunny Morning, it'll LITERALLY be the brightest part of your day!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Recently decided to come to this location for some good Canadian breakfast and I must say I was amazed everything from the attention service and food was just amazing home fries were some of the best I've ever tasted in my life I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Toronto area thank you guys for amazing service"}
{"text":"Yummy, nothing fancy here, just really good food.  Servings are a little on the large side.  Too bad this space is so small.  We were seated at 10:00 no line up.  10:15 the line was long.  We left at 11:30 the line went out the door.  The omelet that I ordered came with home fries.  Fresh, not dried and refried.  I will be back."}
{"text":"A pretty decent breakfast - quick service at a reasonable price.  Appreciated that my scrambled eggs & my husband's soft poached eggs weren't overcooked as they are at most breakfast places.  Peameal bacon & potatoes were good.  Coffee was ok.  It's a real tight squeeze though; the tables are really packed in."}

The service is fast food is good.
Staff are as friendly as they can be.
Price is reasonable. It's a turn & burn"}
{"text":"\"Waffles so good it didn't need syrup,\" says my kid. I think that that is the best review yoh can ask for!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my daughter and two friends yesterday and had to wait for 10 minutes for a table. The restaurant is super cramped and small and reminds me of sunset grill. However, that's where the similarity ended. The quality of the food was fresh and so delicious, whereas sunset grill food always tasted too greasy. 

I had the French delight, recommended by our Asian server with a fruit upgrade for 2 dollars. And my friends had the Benedict with garden salad and bacon plus eggs. The potatoes were real potatoes cooked beautifully and I was able to steal some from my friends plate. It tasted great!

The food was amazing but I was more impressed with our server who kept an eye on our coffee and water cups and always refilled it without us asking her to when it got too low. She seemed to greet everyone by name and I saw a few go out of their way to hug her. I'm not sure if she's the owner or not, but she  was really sweet to my daughter and gave her some colouring pad she can scribble on.. My daughter liked her so much that she allowed the server to play with her. I wish there was a sunny morning on bloor and sherbourne because me and my daughter would be back every day!

This restaurant would be a five star if it weren't for the small space and limited drink option. There also wasn't a lot of high chairs for small kids. But All in all, a great first experience and I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Great service! The portions are huge though, both pancakes and platters. Watch out! 

My husband and I tried the Nutella Dream French Toast and the French Delight, and we both absolutely loved them.

The only drawback I can think of were the sausages, full of fat and didn't taste too good."}
{"text":"Great spot! A bit on the expensive side but I would definitely go back. Only issue we had was I ordered a freshly squeezed orange juice and I clearly saw the waitress pouring a glass of Tropicana."}
{"text":"Always a pleasant experience, I love coming to this place. Simple decor, generous portion size, nice staff, good menu. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I hope I caught them on a bad day.  It's the Monday between Christmas and New Years.  

What caught my eye was the \"Thick Cut Maplewood Smoked Bacon, cooked to order.\"  I love bacon.  I'm sure this bacon would be good in the right circumstance by it was clearly pre-cook and cooled (congealed fat between pieces is a dead give away)... Again this could work, but it was cold to the touch. 
They nailed the eggs and toast.  

My order was served relatively quickly.  I had to ask a second time for my coffee and water... Then a third time for the water.  The coffee was watery (again, maybe a bad day... Because it smelled great)

Tough to imagine coming back, but if it was busy and they had to cook fresh bacon or had some staff management it might be better"}
{"text":"Great food! Great place! Great servers! Everything is so amazing. Had some grilllll cheesee. It came so fast. I came here from Scarborough, but before that. I was wondering about this Breakfast and Lunch that I have never heard and wanted to try it. I believe it was the best Breakfast & Lunch overall than other breakfast and lunch places such as Cora, Eggsmart and so on. I love this and will try other menu when I visit here again! Worth of price! Worth of your moments. Worst of your time here, nothing to waste even if you wait for food or wait in line up. Still foods are not going to waste your life since those are very delicious! I will call my people from Scarborough to visiting here since there are two Sunny Morning Breakfast and Lunch places in GTA! However, guys please come here for good! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Pretty busy for a Saturday morning however we were seated quickly. Waitress was very quick to bring us coffee.   Food came quickly and was hot and fresh. My Clubhouse was excellent. My wife loved her Freddie's sandwich. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"5 stars for the bacon, 3 1/2 stars for the French toast, 5 stars for the toppings on the French toast. highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"What a lovely brunch spot! It reminds me of old school diners you see in the movies. Super tiny and has booth style seating. You get  a LOT of food for the price. I wAs stuffed after my deeelicious meat eaters omelette which was great flavour and well worth it. Coffee was a standard brew but bottomless which is always a plus in my book. Super close to st clair subway ( just a bit south I believe ) definitely worth a try. It was a busy day for them and w were seated quickly and service was on point."}
{"text":"I don't see what all the fuss is about this place. Maybe if you like sweet waffley kind of stuff for breakfast, but if I'm dining out for my morning meal, I want GREASE. Sadly, there is very little here.

Service was fast, efficient and friendly despite it being a very busy Sunday morning with a lineup out the door. I ordered three eggs with toast, bacon and homefries and my boyfriend french toast with eggs, bacon, sausage and homefries.

Let's begin with the homefries; They were tasteless little cubes. Actually, I think they may have been cardboard flavoured. There was no crispiness factor to them and absolutely no seasoning. Probably the worst homefries I've ever had. And I think that if you're a place that does JUST breakfast, you ought to have good homefries.

Bacon was tasty, but it was so floppy and barely cooked. If they had rendered this bacon properly it would have been outstanding. But it just wasn't.

Eggs were standard, if not tasteless. I had mine over easy. Nothing special at all.

Basically this place, for a breakfast place failed on almost every breakfast front that they should have excelled at. I was really bummed because we waited 15 minutes for a table. Again, I suppose if I liked sweet breakfast treats, my perspective might have been different, but if you're looking for old school greasy diner eats, this is not your place. Also, they're not licensed so you can't get a caesar. Boo!"}
{"text":"We came one time, excited to try their delicious menu, but it was sadly under renovations! We finally were able to try it one weekend for brunch. They didn't accept reservations, so we had to wait for about 30 minutes to get a table for 3 people around 11:00am on a Sunday. They have a large parking lot, so there's plenty of parking. 

I had looked over the menu while we were waiting. We were seated at the patio and still, I couldn't choose! There were so many tasty options. After debating between the chipotle burger or the classic eggs benedict, I chose the burger. It was absolutely delicious- such a large burger! As I mentioned, I'm going to have to come back to try that eggs benny. This is a great breakfast spot, and certainly worth the price!"}
{"text":"Ordered a standard egg breakfast,  food was not hot.  Save your time and go to the Grill, cheaper and better service."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Toronto.    Excellent quality food and refreshingly good service.    The Northern Omlette is my personal fav.   Though its hard to pass up on the Freddy Sandwich   bagel cream cheese egg and bacon !    Prices are good and portion size will leave you stuffed!"}
{"text":"Come hungry! This popular brunch spot is always packed. The portions are huge, and the meals are as delicious as they look. The coffee is ever flowing. The service is always friendly and cheerful. They're very accommodating to parents with young babies."}
{"text":"Sunny Morning is our stop whenever we hit the road north. The staff is friendly and they all help each other out. There restaurant is clean as well as the washrooms, which is a wonderful change from some of the downtown diners. I had the French Delight and my husband had the Big Breakfast Skillet both portions are very filing."}
{"text":"A good breakfast place here in West Etobicoke! This little spot has quickly become our go-to for classic breakfast fare.  We went to nearby the Grille today because Sunny Morning was closed -- and the difference was astounding and prompted me to write a review ! 

Of course there are your standard egg dishes, pancakes, French toast etc .. But what I like are the few little specialty items.  For example, I have gotten the Florentia Sunny Scramble twice now and it is delicious . Scrambled eggs with spinach, feta and hollandaise .. Sounds simple but surprisingly yummy and not too heavy.

Service is quick and friendly, prices are good and the place is bright, clean and kid-friendly (bonus - crayons and colouring placemat).  Coming from living downtown where there are tons of breakfast and Cafe options , finding Sunny Morning nearby our current home was a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, service is amazing, location is very convenient. Best breakfast lunch place in all of Toronto. Me and my husband love coming here!"}
{"text":"I have been a few breakfast/brunch place, this one is certainly stand out on my list. It is located at a big box stores complex near 427 and Queensway. Unlike other places, this place only serves breakfast and lunch. They close at 3pm. The restaurant is kinda small (maybe 20 tables or less), but clean and modern. I arrived around 2pm that day, and there were still quite a few people. I imagine people might need to wait in line when brunch time.

There are quite a few choice on the menu, and I was having a hard time to decide. At the end, I took my server's recommendation, and order an Eggs Benjamin, because I love eggs benedict :) The twist with this benedict is that it uses smoke salmon instead of ham. The eggs was cooked perfectly. Hollandaise sauce is also excellent, not too salty or anything that over power the taste of the smoke salmon. The hand-cut home fries were very good too, well seasoned.

One last thing, the staffs are super friendly. I would definitely recommend, and come back for more."}
{"text":"I like it. I had traditional egg breakfast with three eggs, side and toast for $6.49 can't beat this price, The food is always good. Very well priced. Service can get a little sketchy (some servers are faster and friendlier than other), and the place is quite tiny, but I am a regular there and intend to keep it this way. :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here twice now for breakfast, and both times were awesome.
The first time I was boring and had the basic bacon and eggs, just to judge the place, and it was terrific - 5 slices of really good bacon, and enough sides to fill me up. So this time I went deeper into the menu, which is huge, and picked out the Big Breakfast Skillet, and I went with the fruit platter side instead of the regular toast and stuff (see picture). The skillet was great, made with freshly prepared ingredients, and lots of them. The side fruit salad was delicious and huge!
The place is always busy, and if you have to wait a little to get a table, the wait is worth it.
Plenty of friendly, knowledgeable staff will make sure you enjoy your meal.
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place has a variety of breakfast options and also lunch options for those who don't feel like having breakfast.

The pricing is very reasonable and the portions are good to keep you satisfied. They have everything from traditional breakfast, sandwiches, chicken burgers, burgers, eggs benedict, waffles, pancakes, salads and more!

I opted for the classic western sandwich with egg, ham, onion, and green peppers on whole wheat toast and a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette. 

It was delicious. The eggs were folded and cooked to perfection. There was layers and layers of egg mixed with the toppings. The salad was really good as well with a nice blend of various vegetables such as lettuce, cabbage (purple), onions, cherry tomatoes etc. It was a satisfying meal that kept me full but also feeling good about having a healthy lunch. 

Our server was great and super attentive. We will definitely be coming back to try their other breakfast options."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times. Each time I consistently received excellent speedy services. (Same waitress) The food is always delicious and the portion is big at very reasonable price. Highly recommended for people who live or work in the area."}
{"text":"Visited Toronto and came here multiple times. It's new, but bet it will be a breakfast staple."}
{"text":"I'm a long time customer of this place, who keeps coming back for breakfast or brunch with friends and family, but last week I was running some errands with my cousin in the middle of the day, and we decided to stop by and finally try some lunch here. As expected, place is quieter than during the weekends.

We ordered burgers (mine was the chipotle barbecue one), and it tasted really good. the patty was not only big, but also you could tell it was made in house, plus the chipotle barbecue sauce was really nice, and without being extra spicy, it had that kick my mouth needed. Burger it's served open face, with the extra bun on the side, and some toppings already on it, so it's up to you how you want to eat it. Both of us enjoyed lunch very much, and we know where to come back next time!"}
{"text":"After visiting this place again, I can say one more time the food was really good, and the staff was friendly and attentive at all times.
I had a plate of scrambled eggs, with bacon, sausage, potatoes, and a couple of french toasts that tasted like the ones my mom used to prepare for me when I was a kid.
I'm a breakfast lover, and I liked this place, so I will keep coming, trying other different dishes. I will definitely recommend this to friends."}
{"text":"Was looking for waffles and coffee so found this off yelp and decided to give it a try. Arrived in a plaza of big box stores (Home Depot, bed bath and beyond) which worked since I need to shop for some furniture after. This place is a 3.5 star brunch place. 

Didn't realize this was a franchise breakfast place similar to coras or IHOP. 

Arrived at the front door around 10:45am to a pretty large establishment with around 25 tables and 5 booths. The waiter took our names and sat us shortly after. 

Was a bit disappointed to have been seated next to the washrooms. Would be nice if there were doors to the washroom entrances to create more of a separate space with the eating area. 

The waiter took our order pretty quickly. My boyfriend and I ordered coffee and chocolate milk, sweet dream Nutella French toast and hungry teen which has three eggs, bacon, sausages, the works. 

The food tasted pretty good. The french toast was very filling and it had strawberries, bananas and Nutella on top. 

The meal cost $40 with tips and tax for two people including two drinks. A typical price for brunch. We had to pay at the front. 

The decor reminds me of the brunch places you find while on a road trip in the United States. Very American feeling with wooden tables and chairs, white kitchen tiles etc and the kitchen was open so you could hear them making the food. 

The service was excellent. Waiters were very responsive and courteous and promptly took care of us. It was very very nice that the manager called attention from all he patrons at 11:00am for a minute of silent for Remembrance Day."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, yummy food, and very kind and thoughtful staff.

This place is amazing. I had the classic breakfast over easy and it was cooked perfectly. I also ordered some berry pancakes and those were fluffy and light.

Very cheap and very good. You won't go wrong coming here. FYI only pork sausage and bacon sadly."}
{"text":"This is an AMAZING breakfast restaurant. The portion sizes are huge, the prices are phenomenal and the service is outstanding. I didn't know there were so many options available for breakfast. Choosing what to have is the hardest part of the visit. Strongly, strongly recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"If ever i was impressed by a breakfast, this would be the place.  I love breakfast, i could eat it 3 meals a day.  I know some people dont get it and i see the cheap people who say its expensive or its not worth it and make excuses but thats all it is.  Excuses.  The fact is this place is excellent and elevates breakfast in ways they just dont understand.  As a group of 4 we were all delighted with the quality and portion of the breakfast at this little gem of an eatery.  The chocolate waffle topped with real Hershey chocolate chips was light and tasty, i had to sneak a bite from my son's plate.  I had the Eggs Benedict with home fries and it was exactly what i needed.  Delicious.  Another person in our group also had the eggs Benedict but with fruit on the side, and we have another satisfied customer.  The fourth person in our group had the breakfast skillet and was delighted with the fresh grilled veggies and bacon topped with eggs sunny side up on top of it all.  This is somewhere that i would love to go again.  The price is the price and quality costs a bit more than the McDonalds crowd can understand.  This place is a premium breakfast place and i will certainly return.  If you are looking for a quality morning  meal, then this is where you will find it."}
{"text":"The service here is exceptional. It was our first time here so this rating is really from the both of us. 

We shared the smoked salmon egg benedict which was good BUT their nutella dream french toast was LIFE!!! (everything was amazing, the fruits were just perfect and with a little bit of everything on your fork, the combination of everything tasted BOOM!!! 

Will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but the ambiance was not pleasant. Ventilation was so bad, with the kitchen smell it was hard to breathe!"}
{"text":"If you come here, your morning will definitely be wonderful and Sunny due to the massive portions of food and impeccable service you receive. I came here for the first time and ordered the Egg white Omlette that I chose to custom make.... I had shrooms, ham, bacon, spinnach, and swiss cheese and it was one of the best omlettes I have ever had!  The people I came with ordered a variety of dishes from pancakes, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, salad, and delicious Ham slices.  All of the dishes were massive and well worth the money.  

The service was great and all of their servers worked as a team along with not looking to cranky at all when you kno they got up at 5 or 6 am to come to work.  Coffee and Water were bottomless and their fruit platter was really fresh as well.

If you are looking for a great breakfast joint, do not miss out and come here for sum yummy yummy in your tummy!!!"}
{"text":"This place is just what we needed! My boyfriend and I have been looking for a good breakfast join near home and FINALLY it's here! Simple, easy, friendly and yummy!"}
{"text":"The last time I had come here I didn't get to eat and we couldn't stay because the line was was just too long.  Being that I had the opportunity to return on a weekday after 10am I was willing to come back and give it a try.

The place is cozy and it may feel a bit cramped.  Their space is not as open as say Allo Mon Coco in Pointe-Claire which is the last time I remember having brunch on a weekday about the same time in the morning.

The menu is pretty diverse between a standard eggs breakfast to omelettes, to waffles to French toast to fruit and even lunch they have quite a bit to choose from.  We ended up ordering 2 Benedicts, one with peameal (Freddy) and one with smoked salmon (Benjamin).

The Hollandaise sauce was good but not very rich.  The home fries were good as well.  

Both Bennies were good.  I portions are pretty generous for the prices and the service was very attentive and friendly.  The food while good to me doesn't really stand out as something particularly special however for me the service bumped it up to a 4*.

There was salt/pepper on the table but we had to ask for hot sauce and they had a choice of either Tabasco or Franks.  

Overall the service was very good and the food was good.  The servings for what we received and what I was able to see at other tables looked to be quite generous.

Mimosas aren't served until after 11am."}
{"text":"amazing food. Amazing price! Definitely a brunch place that is popular in the west end. Came in on a Saturday morning and the line up was out the door! It is a small and cozy breakfast joint that serves food from eggs, sausages to waffles to pancakes to sandwiches! 

We opted for the skillet breakfast (filled with hashbrown potatoes, onions, green pepper and some cheese and 3 sunny side egg on top of the mix) and a classic breakfast (eggs, bacon, pancakes, toast, hash brown). The skillet was very flavourful and definitely filling. This is definitely a meal where you are full until dinner time! We also ordered a side of fruits and it was super refreshing. No added sugar to the fruit salad like other places! 

Prices are very very fair no wonder the lineups are out the door! Coffee is standard as to any other brunch places with bottomless refills. Will definitely be returning when feeling for a non-greasy and hearty breakfast meal!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in the city!! Lines are long but move fast and worth the wait. Nice to see the same staff month after month, clearly means they value their employer. The \"fresh fruit\" is actually fresh!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was fresh and tested really good. Price is really reasonable as well. Friendly staff and good customer service."}
{"text":"Anyone that coming to this place PLEASE say hello to the tall blonde chick! She was so nice and sweet came around with coffee she made sure we were helped out and she was super sweet. The next time we go In the only way we will stay is if we see her in there shes a crazy worker, on the ball, smiling, just a great gal... look for the tall girl cleaning tables!!!!!! Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered a scrambled egg dish and the lumberjack. Lots of toppings in the scramble, great home fries and the lumberjack had big pieces of tasty bacon and large fluffy pancakes.

I was particularly impressed with our waitress who didn't wear a name tag but on our bill it said our server was 'Sue', she didn't miss a beat... She promised to top off our coffee and actually came back to do it, always made sure mine was decaf, made a check-back to ask if everything was ok, she was fast and efficient, always made sure to acknowledge the incoming and going customers, and also kindly wished us a good day. 

She reminds me of the song 'Short Skirt, Long Jacket' by Cake for some reason."}
{"text":"If you are looking a brunch place not your typical Sunset Grill or Cora's breakfast, come here. There are two locations the original one at Yonge and St. Clair but this location is better of the two and there is ample parking since it's in a plaza. There is more seating and the service is efficient so the wait time is not as long. I always love coming here because of their variety of breakfast options. Their omelettes and pancakes are soooo delicious. My boyfriend usually orders their omelette breakfast and I usually or their lumberjack breakfast which comes with two sausages, bacon, egg, salad or home fries and pancakes. I also tried this combo with their mini belgian waffles and it was absolutely delicious! The portions are massive so you always walk out feeling satisfied and full."}
{"text":"Having been to the Queensway location in Mississauga, we decided to try the original Sunny Morning location at St. Clair and Yonge. We came here around 12pm expecting it to be busy since it was also Mother's Day but instead we were seated right away. This restaurant is a lot smaller than the Queensway location but is always hustling and bustling. You'll find about 15 tables that seat about 2 patrons each. The service is just as friendly and attentive and the quality of the food is consistent. The only thing I would have to say is lacking is that the presentation isn't as nice. 

My bf ordered the meat lovers omelette and I ordered the French delight. Both were delicious and the portions were massive! My french toast dish was one of their recommended items on the menu and it was wonderfully tasteful. 

They also serve a wide variety of lunch items such as steak, burgers and salads. Definitely coming back to try either of these.

Be warned there if you come here there's only street parking available or the TTC is more accessible."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Friday morning, it was relatively busy but my friend and I were told we could choose where we wanted to sit. The staff was very attentive and answered any questions we had as well as made suggestions. Our food came out quickly and tasted great!"}
{"text":"Went today french toast 3 eggs bacon sausage  tomatoe huge. Great service went 930 got a table right away.
Next time pancakes or waffles they looked great. Maplewood  bacon done just right. Came by for coffee refills"}
{"text":"Just as good as the original, but bigger and more spacious. Tried the skillet - barely finished (really good value). Closer to home too!"}
{"text":"First time in this place and loved it. Small space but the line moved pretty fast.  Best omelet with spinach I ever had."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast 
It's my 2 time in this location 
They do a great job 
I try today the guilt free it was amazing and great portion of the fruit."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend after reading some good reviews and left very satisfied and full! 

The service was very good, our waitress was very kind and prompt. Our food came out in a timely manner with everything we had asked for. I got the eggs Benny and my girlfriend had the western omelette. We also shared some of the famous Nutella pancakes. Everything was excellent! Although the we ordered way too much and couldn't finish everything, we were very happy with the food and service! Only one upset was the home fries which could have been seasoned a little better. I found them somewhat dry. 

Otherwise, the service and food was really good and I would recommend coming by for some breaky!"}
{"text":"Overrated! Wow, by looking at these reviews its obvious the masses are content with mediocrity! If you haven't eaten in places across the country you wouldn't know any better. The coffee is some of the worst I've tasted; like hot water. My egg breakfast was extremely bland. Potatoes were nothing special. For the price, this is my second time and both experiences were disappointing. The only positive was the friendly staff, even though they got the order wrong. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was yummy. Solid options, decent service, good place for brunch on the west end."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! High class and variety of food choices from bancakes, waffles, and omelettes as well as different drinks. I'd love to visit again for sure!"}
{"text":"The menu looked good, the storefront was nice, but I ended up disappointed. We were seated immediately but then sat there for at least 15 minutes until a waitress came to get our drink order. The place wasn't even half full so I admit that didn't help my opinion of the place. We put in our order and got our food and it was ok, not great, just ok. Z got the bacon and maple syrup pancakes and it was kind of cool, they gave him his own little container of pure maple syrup, but it was odd, there were huge chunks of bacon in the pancakes, almost like they took a third of a strip of bacon and stuck it right into the batter. The blueberry pancakes I had were fine but the pancake batter wasn't anything special. All in all the place was ok, food was ok, service was not so I would probably try another place next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"One word: Nutella. Had both the Nutella pancakes and Nutella French toast and it was amazing. Fruits were fresh, bacon was crisp, eggs were eggy and Nutella was Nutella. Service was good. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"So this place just changed owners.... Was formally sunshine spot. Was amazing. Went there today and waited 20 minutes just to get a menu and coffee. Almost an hour later we got our food, which is our usual eggs Benedict that i usually upgrade with a fruit bowl. Option is no longer available, we were brought home fries instead of the salad and French fries we had ordered. They however quickly brought out our proper orders. The fries were brown and tasted like month old fryer grease, and the dressing for the salad, which is served on a tiny plate, was several different consistencies, as it was served on the side, and appeared at least a week old, and was then confirmed by the waitress that  \"yeah, we don't use it that often\". On top of this when we tried to politely inform them of the food I was shot a dirty look by the chef, and was almost over charged for an item i hadn't ordered. Needless to say will not be coming back there, sad to see a great establishment go. Hoping they were just having an off day but I won't be gambling with my money going there again."}
{"text":"If you can beat the crowd and lines this is a solid brunch spot with great food, big portions, at a great price. Not super fancy, but a bright, clean and casual restaurant."}
{"text":"We visited on a Saturday morning around 9:15 AM, and the place was about 80% full! And for good reason. Every part of our visit was a delight, and the perfect way to start off the weekend. Think of this place like a very, very much-improved Cora's with top-of-the-charts service. It's the epitome for a hearty, traditional breakfast joint, and we couldn't have been happier with our Saturday breakfast choice. We were served by Connor, who was super attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. 

We ordered: a coffee, a hot chocolate, an eggs benedict with salmon and home fries, and the breakfast skillet with three sunny side-up eggs and a side of fruit for an extra $2.50. The food was fresh, hearty, and very filling. In short, delicious. As an aside, note that portions for their breakfast plates are very generous, so if you're not too hungry, you may want to consider sharing.

For two people, with tax, tip, and the extra $2.50 for the side of fruit, our total was $37.56."}
{"text":"I searched Yelp for the breakfast spots while en route to Niagara Falls from the airport and it brought us to Sunny Morning. At 9AM, the restaurant was packed and busy, which is always a good sign! We only had to wait 5 minutes before getting seated.

Their menu ranges from all of your typical breakfast foods, such as pancakes, waffles, omelettes, eggs, and sandwiches. If I could use one word to describe the food here, it would be... fresh! Everything was cooked perfectly, the portions were generous, and everything came out steaming hot! It seems like they brand themselves on making everything from scratch using the freshest ingredients, which is always a win in my book.

The service was friendly and the food came out quickly. I'd definitely come back again whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Great as always! I love coming here when I visit Toronto. Good food and decent prices! Will be back in the future."}
{"text":"Freddie's Carmel waffle is a hedonistic sweet taste of perfection! I was drawn by the picture of this menu item, especially the generous portion of banana slices. 

Choices range from lean to indulgent, our group ran the gamut, and everything was excellent. Service people were simply charming, a wonderful experience, even if the Uber driver picking us up had a hard time finding the place. It IS out of town, but worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Great, traditional breakfast place.  HUGE portions, so be prepared (and I'm American!).  I think the prices are reasonable, even if you ignore the large portions.  

We were seated right away on a late Sunday morning (11am) and were served quickly and efficiently.  My boyfriend got the waffle with berries, which was perfection.  Not too sweet, really tasty.  I honestly don't remember what I ordered, but it was something savory, and i definitely got the potatoes and toast that came along with it, which were both really good.  

A solid breakfast option."}
{"text":"For last Monday's breakfast, I went to Sunny Morning @ Yonge and St Clair. I was a bit surprised that it was not very busy, it has been busier when I have been there before, but perhaps because this was a late Monday morning. The place is very bright inside, spotlessly clean wooden furniture, with lots of pictures of their food around the walls. The service is pretty fast and friendly also. The one drawback is that the place is very small, so the tables are quite close together. The one quirk I noticed was that each table has a Tabasco condiment server, but it included Frank's Red Hot sauce instead.

The menu is fairly standard, waffles and french toast and egg breakfasts, but the eggs can also come as a scrambled bowl with the meat and vegetables mixed in (so not unlike an omelette). Most dishes offer the choice of home fries or garden or fruit salads. They also have sandwiches, burgers and salads for lunch.  I chose the Caramel Belgian Waffle. The waffle was very large and lighter than I expected, but still very filling with all the toppings. It had a pile of pecans and banana slices covered with caramel and then whipped cream on top. Very enjoyable but not too sweet. The bill was $16 with coffee, so pretty much average for these breakfasts. Definitely a recommendation, a little better than the Etobicoke location, but both are good."}
{"text":"There are slim pickings for breakfast places in Aurora.  Good thing I discovered this place on Yelp!

Menu is \"typical\" of most breakfast places with some decent lunch offerings.   

So what is special about this place?   
1.  Service is very good by ALL staff!  I think we had three people serve us!  And they were friendly and polite.
2.  Food is good.   If you look at my close up of the egg you will see something that is missing....No oil and grease!   Bonus!
3.  Comfortable seating environment 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is exactly what a breakfast/ brunch restaurant should be like.
It is straight forward place that doesn't try hard yet does everything really well. The eggs were perfectly cooked, the waffle was awesome and coffee was great but what I really liked was how fast the service was. 
we got our food in less than 5 minutes even though it was Saturday morning brunch time. It was packed but the waitress was fast and on the spot with everything.
Bottom line, these guys know their thing. Like a well oiled machine."}
{"text":"I randomly discovered this place while I was working near Yonge & St. Clair. My co-workers and I love going to this place for brunch on the weekend when we come in for work, or lunch during weekdays. The staff here are super friendly and gave us some great recommendations for what to order. The portions are fairly big, so it's definitely worth every dollar you spend.
 
The restaurant is more similar to a chain breakfast franchise rather than a \"hipster\" brunch joint. However, it gives off a more homely feel than a Cora's or Eggspectation. I've tried their waffles with fruits and whipped cream, and it is super delicious! The waffles are very fresh and crispy. Out of all the things I've tried at this place, my absolute favourite food to eat here has to be their signature chicken sandwiches! There is something about the soft warm bakery bun, paired with grilled chicken and vegetables, topped with mayo that makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Every bite of it is so juicy and delicious!

So if you are looking for a place with super friendly staff that makes you feel welcomed at all times, and a menu that has simple yet great-tasting breakfast foods, then Sunny Morning is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Smaller than it looks on the inside. Portions are wonderfully huge! A little expensive for a greasy spoon type place. Service was great. My sister did find a small hair in her food, but I would go back. Also great for both health conscious and not!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Sunny Morning!

They do have tiny tables for two peeps (what is UP with that breakfast places?!) and it was very busy when we arrived around 11am on a holiday Saturday.

Our server was very pleasant, I believe his name was Brent. The girl filling our coffees and grabbing us ketchup seemed to hate existing in this world but I just ignored her foul attitude, everyone has an off day you know! ;)

Since this is the New Year and I was trying to \"behave\" a bit, I ordered the \"lighter\" menu option, which came with poached eggs, cottage cheese, toast, and fresh fruit. Coffee was good was was refilled (although we did have to ask). I enjoyed my breakfast and so did my bae. The fresh fruit was actually delicious, juicy and flavourful, which sometimes doesn't happen at breaky places - yay!!

Overall, this is my favourite spot (to date) in Etobicoke for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Delicious huge meals...tasty options...great bacon...great prices...relaxed atmosphere...waitress was like out of a movie...helpful kind and attentive. We will be back."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday around 12:30pm and saw a small lineup outside the restaurant - always a good sign! Our group of 8 were told it would be a 15 minute wait, but it ended up being 30 minutes. Note: they do not take reservations. 

I ordered a Mediterranean omelette (tomato, olives, feta cheese, and peppers) with home fries. The omelette was very tasty - they definitely did not skimp on the feta cheese. The hand-cut home fries were mostly good, but there were a couple burnt pieces as well as a couple undercooked pieces. The portion size for the omelette dish in particular is generous to say the least. 

One friend ordered the fruit smoothie and said that she liked the taste but it was too thin/watery for a smoothie. 

Other than that, my friends all enjoyed their meals, which included the Nutella french toast, pancakes, scrambled eggs, and grilled cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"4.5 for my visit to Sunny Morning for a weekend brunch. 
The restaurant was packed with a long line-up at 10am. We were told our wait time was 25 minutes so we decided to shop around at a nearby Bed Bath & Beyond. When we returned after 20 minutes we had already missed our table. So I guess the wait time was much faster than expected. 

I opted for a peameal bacon traditional egg breakfast which came with 3 eggs and my selection of a side which was a salad. It was super filling and had a good amount of refillable coffee. 

Overall I had a good brunch experience at this location. It felt really spacious and service was great and fast. It felt completely different than the St. Clair & Yonge branch."}
{"text":"My friend and have been wanting to come here for lunch during our lunch break, and when we finally made it, the food didn't disappoint. I decided to get the egg and sausage breakfast. It was a really good portion, and definitely filling. It came with 4 pieces of buttered toast, 3 eggs, 3 sausages, and between home fries, fresh fruits at extra cost, garden salad, I decided on the garden salad. 

I felt like the service could be improved, but maybe we just caught them at a very busy time. If I go back, I'd be interested in trying their pancakes."}
{"text":"Great place for home-style breakfast joint.  They have some unique menu items.   Overall the quality has not disappointed us over many visits"}
{"text":"It's what you'd expect from a breakfast place. Smaller portion than Cora's, tastes pretty much the same. It's a small place so, small patio. I'd go again if I'm really craving for breakfast but it tastes just generic, which is good but not great."}
{"text":"Solid spot for a quick bite for breakfast f you're in the area. Just don't go out of your way.

The staff are quiet and attentive. The place itself could do with some renovations. The white walls and tile floor make it seem like the inside of a bathroom. It's clean just feels cramped in."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Thick and perfectly cooked bacon, fluffy pancakes, and fresh fruits! Everything was cooked and prepared on point. Generous portions (not the biggest I have had though). I would have given 5/5 for the food we got. So here is why I am giving 4/5. Both my boyfriend and I wanted to get fries as our side. But after seeing quite a lot of burnt pieces from other customers' plates (while we were waiting in the line), we decided not too. I have seen and had way better fries at other breakfast places. 

There is a reason why this place is so busy. We got there just before 11am on Saturday, and there was already a long line. Although it was a pleasant experience, there was nothing special or memorable about their food. If you are in the area, I would highly recommend this place for breakfast and lunch. However, not worth a drive just for this food. I have had better breakfast elsewhere in Toronto."}
{"text":"Average, not bad. On a very busy weekend morning, service was still very fast and very nice. This is a great spot! They got some classics and some interesting items on the menu to try"}
{"text":"Not just your ordinary bacon and eggs. This is where you can get much more interesting breakfasts without searching for a place featured on tv. And, everything is scratch made except for the Hollandaise, which is unusual even for restaurants in upper end hotels.

For example, a variety of massive, airy Belgian waffles, loaded up with Nutella, caramel sauce, pecans, almonds, fruit, or pancakes with the  same topping options. Or a couple mini waffles with a regular egg breakfast. 

I ordered one of their scrambles, a bowl of scrambled eggs with chopped sausages, mushrooms, and other ingredients in a bowl with toast and fried potatoes on the side. I couldn't figure why I was having trouble getting past the halfway mark--the server revealed there was around 6 eggs in the dish!  Sure, you can also get a \"normal\" egg breakfast for $7, but where is the fun in that?  

But I really need to go in hard on the waffles next time. Just stealing bites from others is not sufficient."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place of all time. 
We stopped here on our way back to Buffalo from Toronto for a quick easy meal. We were able to get a table immediately. The server was great. The food came out fast. The portions were huge. There were FIVE strips of bacon. The home fries were amazing. The scrambled eggs weren't soggy. Even the toast was great. No complaints whatsoever here. 

If you like breakfast and meats make time to stop here for sure."}
{"text":"Always good service and great food, the atmosphere is very nice as well. Prices are very fair for what you get."}
{"text":"One of the better brunch restaurants that I've been to. I have to say: 10 out of 10, would go again. The environment was a family friendly one. Servers were really nice and were willing to go the extra mile for your satisfaction. My brother and I got bacon breakfasts and my gf got the French toast with nutella and strawberries, which looked amazing. 

Nothing like sweet and savoury to start off your day, and this restaurant was a perfect place to go. 

Awesome!"}
{"text":"Breakfast as good as it gets. I was there Sunday morning, it is a busy place but that takes nothing from the quality of service or the food you get here.

Wrote my name and waited to get seated, the process was pretty easy and we were seated withing 15 minutes.

Our server followed through our order and got what we wanted. It was a beautiful day outside and the environment was replicated in the restaurant. They had fresh orange juice which was really good and I don't really know if other breakfast places serve it.

I ordered steak and eggs and the steak was medium done to perfection, toast was crispy and buttery (I am getting hungry again typing this). We also got Waffle with nutella, straberries and bananas and it had generous amount of everything, the waffle wasn't very heavy unlike other places and was very easy on the stomach.

TL;DR, if i am ever in Mississauga again and need breakfast, this would be my first choice. Perfect breakfast experience."}
{"text":"This place is the best breakfast place on the Queensway strip it's much better than the Q
And some of the other bar and grills along the way don't be fooled this is nothing like Cora's the portions are excellent the decor is excellent and doesn't remind you of the kindergarten classroom , very good service with tasty food!
Highly highly recommend"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the eggs benedict, the hollandaise  sauce is so rich and flavorful. My boyfriend got the lumber jack and the pancakes are super dense but fluffy. Everything was delicious and the service staff are super attentive and friendly. Only thing I didn't really like is maybe the coffee. It could be a little more bolder."}
{"text":"I was very frustrated as they have put a new rule in to not allow take out on weekends. Sergio reached out to me and explained things to me with the future plans of expansion to resolve this. I appreciate him reaching out!"}
{"text":"Great option for etobicoke, odd location but people are going, this is one I would never think to visit or even see without yelp.  Prices a bit high, definitely would return."}
{"text":"Two visits in two days.  First as a family, second with friends.

Full assortment of inventive breakfast fare including:
Waffles, pancakes and French toast
Breakfast sandwiches
Benedicts
Classic egg dishes
Scrambled and Omelets

Fruit is a hefty uncharge as a side but it's a HUGE portion of very high quality fruit.  And they warned us both days of the uncharge.

Each day we had leftovers, so the portions are generous.

Seating available outside.  Not a great view but we had some great shade and a breeze.

Friendly service.

Apparently there is a long wait, but both days we were seated immediately.  10am on a Friday and 8am on a Saturday."}
{"text":"A bit sparse on the decor but a very bright and healthy place to enjoy a very large and healthy breakfast."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the level of friendliness and professionalism of the staff.
They had me at hello...
They were able to accommodate my family of six with no reservations.  The food portions were pretty big.  Wide variety of dishes to suit any taste.  Mine was delicious, so was my mom's... lol... in fact, everyone's dish looked delicious.  I had the Big Breakfast Skillet and my mom had The Mediterranean.  I wanted to try one of the sweet dishes but i knew I wouldn't have room.  They also looked really good.  The prices were very reasonable.  Everyone enjoyed it, including the picky teens... :)
I'm looking forward to returning and trying the other dishes."}
{"text":"Especially the pancakes are really really good. All in all everything was very good. The waitress was very friendly as well. There is nothing to say bad about this place."}
{"text":"Our first stop in Canada and I'm excited that we made a good choice to come here! We're from California (southern) where brunch is a BIG deal. This cute spot exceeded our expectations.

The servers are awesome. Everyone has a smile and is eager to assist in any way.

THE FOOD. If I had to sum up our meals in one word, it would be 'FRESH'! I was gonna go for something with Nutella, but I decided on mixed fruit on top of waffles. It was perfect. For a second I forgot what Nutella was. The amount of fresh and sweet fruit they placed on top plus the maple syrup curbed my sweet tooth craving. 
My boyfriend ordered the lumber jack platter. Ok..never had breakfast sausage like that before. So so good! The side potatoes were cooked perfectly, the bacon just delicious, and his pancakes were different but still amazing!
The coffee just wasn't so great. That's why I couldn't give the fifth star:( coffee is a big deal for us, especially while brunching!

If you want to \"brunch\" at a place with excellent customer service and quality ingredients for a change then come here."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices. This is a very good option for a quick breakfast, brunch or lunch. I like everything on the menu from traditional dishes like eggs Benedict to lighter meals like a yoghurt parfait. I would highly recommend this as an option for an inexpensive brunch-type meal."}
{"text":"As we are new to toronto, we Spent all morning looking for a Good place to have breakfast, just thinking how everywhere we went was either too busy or just too crowded and long wait times we came across this beauty. Sunday afternoon-ish still pretty busy but boy was it worth it! Friendly staff and GREAT food. One of the best places to have a good breakfast. I got the lumber jack and by far one of the best I've ever had. Pancakes were soft and fluffy, bacon was great and the fruit was really fresh. I highly recommend this place. Was very happy! And tummy was full. :)"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today . Got the usually eggs Benedict . It was ok , what really got me was the nutella covered French toast Mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Another great breakfast - love the new Nutella menu items.  My French toast was served to perfection.
Glad to see the expansion!"}
{"text":"I'm not much of an egg eater but I've wanted to try an eggs benedict. this place had great reviews so I decided to check it out. it's conveniently placed in the queensway east mall. I went for brunch on a weekday and it wasn't too busy at all but I've heard it gets hectic on weekends. the service was super friendly and welcoming. our server Brent was an angel and made sure we were satisfied! I got the eggs benjamin, an eggs benedict with smoked salmon and a side of their home fries. the eggs benji (I shall call it) was absolutely delicious!! the hollandaise was irresistible and the home fries were delicious. the food was great and reasonably priced (around $10-$15 for a good sized meal) but the service is what will keep me coming back here. I hope to try the nutella dream french toast next time :)"}
{"text":"Always have great service and the food is delicious! Servings and price are great! Enough space and lighting! We hung out for awhile and they didn't even kick us out or stare at us rudely like other breakfast/brunch places!"}
{"text":"I arrived here around 2pm with a couple friends for a late Sat brunch. This place reminds me of those travel/econo lodge breakfast rooms, its small with cheap but clean decor, and has a coffee station along the side.

The service was friendly but the restaurant did fill up fast and the 2/3 servers became quite busy.

Food was mediocre, and priced a little high for the quality of the fare (ie. The breakfast \"platters\" and eggs/omelettes). I found the home fries a tad chewy and dry and they lacked seasoning. Sausages were typical links but nonetheless very tasty, I enjoy a crisper bacon but these were fine, the packages were fluffy but a little dry. 

There was a small kitchen oversight as a side salad was ordered but home fries were delivered instead. Once the busy waitress was notified she apologized and said we could keep the home fries and she'll bring the salad right away. I thought this was a nice gesture as usually restaurants will take back the plate and your left empty until the correction is made. Sometimes I wonder \"do they plan to scoop the mistaken side off the plate to reserve it?\" Lol 

I would come back if I was in the area, upgrade to the fruit $2, but I much prefer sunset grill @yonge/eg for the same kind of fare."}
{"text":"This has become our new favourite breakfast place. The staff is very friendly and accommodating and always make you feel like you have come home for brunch. 

The food is always amazing and you can beat the price, I haven't tried out their Nutella menu yet but if that's your thing they got you covered. 

Just a tip though either get there really early in the morning on weekends or prepare for a bit of a wait this place is popular for the locals and since we moved to the area we hit it up at least three times a week. I can't wait for their reopening and see the new expanded place."}
{"text":"Really terrific breakfast spot. Small space on Yonge just south of St. Clair, \"North Rosedale\". Crowded but fast, attentive service and a very pleasant vibe. All the usual stuff on the menu- done to perfection if my \"bacon and eggs\" is an indication. Toast perfectly buttered. Bacon crispy and generous in portion. My daughter's Mediterranean omelette was too big for her so I liberally sampled that too and it was great. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Breakfast done very well. Simple yet good. Everything tasted very fresh. The Nutella French Toast lived up to the hype. I am usually very disappointed with coffee served at these kind of of places, however the coffee was so good I had 3 cups! will definitely be back - tomorrow morning."}
{"text":"Great greasy spoon. 

Breakfast was pretty good, they offer 3 eggs with most of their breakfasts - asked for two, still had to pay for three...I was expecting it, but still. 

Will likely be back when I'm in Toronto next - it's the closest breakfast place to my aunt's...."}
{"text":"As someone who absolutely loves breakfast, I am thrilled to have finally found the best place for breakfast. While you will miss out on a few things such as a cool location, trendy vibe, $16 eggs Benny, or exotic ingredients, you will have a great breakfast!!

Here are a few key points:

1. I have been here four times at different times of the morning or early afternoon. Every server (including Shannon today) has been quick with refills, taking orders, and helpful opinions. While I wont say that you never get great service at a casual service restaurant, you definitely don't get it often. Sunny Morning is the exception to that rule.
2. Everything is delicious and just a little better. At first I thought this might be another well known chain under a different name. Well, if it is, for the same price the food and details around the food are just better, way better. There are no cheap syrup or ketchup packets here. The French toast tastes like they used enough eggs. The home fries are perfectly seasoned. The eggs are actually of a normal size. They don't appear to cut corners.
3. They add creative options as well. If you are really hungry, their bowls are a small feast. The Popeye omelette is a tasty blend of tomatoes, feta, and Spinach. You can also find all standard breakfast items, as well as a pretty delicious looking burger that I have not tried.

I can't wait to go back. Note that weekends get crazy busy. However, it is worth the wait, and Bed Bath and Beyond is right next door."}
{"text":"Ordered the hungry teen cause I was starving. 

3 eggs, 2 sausages, 2 pieces bacon and 3 pieces of pea meal served with home fries and toast. 

Was greeted by the door by a super friendly smiling server who showed me to a table. Ordered within 3 minutes of arriving despite it being busy and food arrived within a very reasonable time. 

The food was delicious. Eggs were cooked perfectly and the server checked on me to ensure everything was to my liking. This is probably the best standard breakfast joint in the area. 

Left feeling very satisfied. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch place!! I really love this place! why?! 1 thing and 1 thing only that sold me to this place! FREDDY'S CARAMEL WAFFLE!!!! #$%^&. This has everything i want in a waffle minus the banana. I'm not a big fan of Bananas only because it makes me physically sick but i do miss eating them. Back to my favourite waffle in the entire world...sweet milk caramel, pecans, the waffle is light and crispy and you cant forget the whipped cream! I never usually finish a whole plate of waffles but this one i did!

Second thing that blew me out of this world was their Eggs Benjamin. I really recommend it if you like smoked salmon and gooey poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise sauce to bind it all together. This dish made me love brunch in the first place!
The boyfriend got the french delight and swapped the french toast for the Nutella dream french toast. It came with 3 eggs, bacon, sausage, and home fries. Their home fries are sooooooooo good! The prices are what others might say are pretty reasonable, i would say its cheap! 

This place is super busy, but we got seated right away! I definitely would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast spot. I stopped here yesterday to fuel up for a long drive from Toronto to Chicago on a recommendation from my trusty Yelp app and I was not disappointed. The food satisfied the three fs of road trips - fast, fresh, and filling. I'm usually not a huge breakfast fan, and eggs are not my favourite thing in the world, but I love fresh veggies, so I got the big breakfast skillet. It was all very fresh and the eggs were cooked well enough that they didn't bother me too much. The home fries were also very good. The portion was HUGE. I could barely finish half the skillet. And I was very full after. As an extra bonus - the washrooms were very clean. I would definitely stop back here if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is among one of the best breakfast spots in the southern region of Etobicoke by a landslide. Why? The fruit salad. 

Okay, that's not the only reason but it's certainly worth revisiting for over and over again! Personally I usually go for a fruit salad substitute when I'm looking for a starch alternative in the early mornings, and typically I'm expecting a small cup with a few unripe pieces of melon and a grape or two because sadly this is the reality of restaurant fruit (unless you go to Cora's). But Sunny Morning gives you a heaping portion of strawberries, pineapples and oranges in a familiar kidney-shaped dish (is that a nausea bowl they give you at the hospital?). Regardless of the chinaware I couldn't be more thrilled and spoiled. 

On the side of my fruit main I had a mediterranean omelette and toast on the side because, boy can I eat in the morning. The omelette was absolutely perfect. Everything on my plate was very obviously fresh and done just right. 

The service was friendly, speedy and attentive, and the prices were slightly lower than say, EggSmart or Sunset Grill, which I love because you get much higher quality and quantity for your buck. 

The only thing I would like to warn you about is the line up to get inside. An optimistic wouldn't see this as a problem because the food is worth the wait, but in the colder months it is tough to wait. The maximum wait time, especially on a Sunday is probably about 20 minutes, but breakfast is usually a quick meal for most people. 

Overall, I wouldn't change a thing!"}
{"text":"Came here at 1030 on a Sunday with my boyfriend. It was not packed yet so we got seated right away on the patio (that overlooks the parking lot but still a nice option on a summer day). The service started out exceptional. We were greeted right away and had our drinks and food orders taken. As we waited for our food I observed our server with his other guests, again everything started with a pardon me/sorry and ended with a thank you. It was nice to see a breakfast place have this level of service since it is usually quite hectic and service suffers. Our food arrived shortly after ordering. Good value, big portion food. I got the peameal bacon and eggs (8.69) and my BF sausage and eggs (7.69). Coffee was typical breakfast joint coffee, nothing great. Unfortunately by the time we finished, the place was packed and service was compromised a bit. We asked our server 3x for the bill and waited 15 mins for it. He was more concerned about giving good service to newly arrived guests, which is fine, but don't forget about your current guests!"}
{"text":"Minus 10 stars.  Found a hair on my plate (a separate order of sausages) which they did take back and SAID they redid but the sausage was not even warm so it was more then likely the same sausage that they brought back minus the hair.  I also had ordered your basic pancakes which had a flour taste which was absolutely unappetizing.  There was honestly nothing good about this experience.  I left pretty much all my food back, paid the bill, and left.  But even though I paid for food that was pretty much garbage, I will never go back and if asked by any friends/family what is a good breakfast place to eat, Sunny Morning Restaurant in Aurora will NEVER be one that I recommend."}
{"text":"We got there around 12.30, there was a line up, but luckily it moved very quickly and we were seated within 10 min. The service was fairly quick, we had coffee within 5 minutes of sitting. The decor was nothing special. It just looked like sunset grill inside. We ordered a meat lovers scramble bowl and French toast with bacon, sausage, and home fries. The quality is definitely above average, however it is not anything special. All the items on the menu are standard breakfast fare, at a reasonable price. Overall, the service was good, the food was good and the price was good. Just nothing memorable to push it over the edge for a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Adequate but not good value for the price. Pancakes from a mix, homefries from frozen, and cheap and nasty fake maple syrup are all disappointing. You could easily do much better at home, or for the price ($10-12 for most combos) enjoy a home-cooked breakfast at any number of other brunch places in the city. Friendly and quick service, though, so convenient if you're in the area, and open early 7 days a week."}
{"text":"I always come here! Food is great and good portions. They have many options plus dessert as well. They have other locations as well. I normally get the eggs benedict or a nutella waffle. And bottomless coffee what more can you ask for? 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Really good, compared to others in the casual dining style .

Friendly staff, the food was fresh especially the Salmon.
The salad was a great add on, love the cherry tomatoes."}
{"text":"Cute little place with very friendly servers, excellent food, quick service and a menu that won't blow all the cash in your wallet.

We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. One time my cousin and I both had hair in our food but I decided to try one more time because accidents happen. Today I got a coffee mug with an inch and a half of purple lipstick stains around the rim. My eggs were ok at best. It came with a salad that looked a day old seeing as the leafs were wilted and same with the cucumber edges. The only thing that looked fresh was the cut halves of the cherry tomatoes and I also got sliced tomato on the side that was so hard it was either not even close to ripe or frozen. When I told the server (who was nice) she took the coffee off my bill... that's it! I didn't even touch the salad or the sliced tomatoes. Not worth the money or time. Go to sunset grill for better food at the same price or Cora's which is a little more expensive but WAY WAY BETTER! I will not be going back."}
{"text":"We came here after looking for a nice diner with all the basics that does it well. The atmosphere was bright but comfortable, and the menu had great choices and combos at decent prices. I like that you can add 1-3 pancakes to any meal as a side. The food was somewhat of a disappointment, however. The pancake was dense and sticky inside, not fluffy at all, and the eggs were strangely bland....must be from chickens on a poor diet, is all I could come up with. The bacon and peameal bacon was good, as were the potatoes and toasts. The final disappointment was the maple syrup, which was closer to corn syrup in texture and flavor. I'm not sure what folks are rating this place so high, to be honest."}
{"text":"Second visit as good as the first.  Picked a less busy time.  Food and service fast and hot!  Adapted my meal to my tastes. Friendly and informed staff make all the difference. Thanks for letting my perform and random act of kindness.  Nice to have you in the neighborhood.  We'll be back"}
{"text":"Firstly, as with most breakfast places there was a wait but it wasn't bad, we waited around 10-15 min (we arrived at 11am). We ordered the bacon &  eggs and French Delight. It was absolutely amazing! Everything was cooked perfectly although we did find the bacon slightly salty but nothing that would ruin the meal. The French Toast was very good and surprisingly, the coffee was delicious, rivaling a regular coffee place. The staff is very attentive, walking around every fee minutes to refill your water and coffee. Overall, a great experience and will be returning here. Highly recommended and worth the wait time!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good about our first experience here. Every detail that matters in a good breakfast I.e., the thickness of the pea meal bacon to how hot and tasty the coffee was, was taken care of really well. First class attention to everything. 
Don't change a thing. Worth driving for."}
{"text":"This is a small place but great food. We went there for brunch , there might be a wait if you have a big party as seating is small. Ambience isn't that great but very clean . The food portions are big and very yummy!"}
{"text":"Long line up for this place on a Sunday but worth it! Food was great and affordable and environment was clean and spacious!"}
{"text":"Food is good but they charge extra fees if you share the dish with someone. Service is not satisfying in general. I might not go there again."}
{"text":"One of the better breakfast locations.  

1. They have maple syrup (the real stuff) available.  
2. They serve real butter with their food
3. They have freshly daily made fruit salad as optional add on
4. They have the awesome combo of french toast, eggs, bacon... which I always want and have to figure out how to get usually
5. They were packed on a weekday morning

Coffee offered has free refills.  My husband had issue with his cup not being refilled often enough but we could see it was very busy and they were training new staff."}
{"text":"We have been here several times in the last few months. We are always impressed with the service and staff, but most importantly - the quality of the food. We have not had an item we didn't enjoy, and the guests we brought with us agree. 

If all they offered was their bacon, I would still give them a 5 star review. There is nothing fancy or special about this bacon, it is just perfectly cooked and consistent every time. The waffles are crisp and fluffy and their potatoes are well made.

Nothing here feels phoned in, it's all made from scratch and with care and we will be dining here many times in the future.

Bonus - good place for little ones, just no change table in the men's bathroom."}
{"text":"Magnificent. That's pretty much the best way to describe this place. It has all the looks of a chain place (and it technically is,) but the food is nothing chain like.

I went for my standard, Eggs Benedict. Lee gave in and went for the Nutella French Toast. My benny was wonderful: nice, thick peameal, eggs poached very nicely, the hollandaise quite nice. Lee really enjoyed his Nutella French Toast, and I snagged a couple of bites, too. Very nice!

I would 100% go back here for brunch. The service was really great, and the breakfast was second to none."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast.
Clean and tidy.
Friendly service
Best home fries in TO"}
{"text":"Just what a breakfast place should be. Friendly and fast. Lots of turnover. Wait staff with attitude. Good grub."}
{"text":"This breakfast/brunch spot is new in the area.  It's in the Canadian tire Plaza on queensway. My family and I go here when breakfast outside seem suitable during busy days, running errands.  While the location is a bit small, they offer patio breakfast in the summer. There's usually a line when we head here on weekends but weekdays, it's easy to find a table. They have a cosy feel to the place, with your \"next-door neighbours cooking up your meals\" feel to it. We love breakfast at this place. We have yet to try their brunch options but they definitely look yummy. I usually order The popeyes omelette, it's pretty awesome.  The bacon is offered as extra, but for the price it's good quality bacon not like the ones most breakfast places serve. They are good cuts, they don't shrink to half the size and they give you a plate of 5 pieces.  If you're a bacon lover, it's plenty for one serving.  My husband and I usually share.  They also serve awesome mimosas starting at 11:30 a.m. so brunch is even tastier with that. Definitely our go to breakfast place in the area."}
{"text":"Still the best in service, consistency, and food quality after well over a hundred visits to one of my faves!  Love this place."}
{"text":"Good service good food, I chose healthy Mediterranean omelette with fruits and my beau ordered Belgian delight. We loved the maple syrup suggested by our server and it is a must try specially if you traveling from states, we got some home with us."}
{"text":"They could've used a bit more seating when we went because it was pretty packed. But nothing really stood out from your average breakfast restaurant, except that it felt a bit pricey. The menu is somewhat repetitive as well."}
{"text":"This place is by far my favourite breakfast place in etobicoke. The food is awesome and the service is even better! The quality of their menu is great and I love the fact you can sub out home fries for fresh fruit (just wish it didn't cost extra). 

The price I would say is comparable or slightly cheaper than Cora's but I still would rather support this smaller chain!"}
{"text":"Sunny morning is quite a neighbourhood gem. Partially because it is the only (decent) place in St.Clair/Yonge. Partially, because the food is good. Primarily though, it's because the portions are HUGE. 
We went for brunch and had an omelette and a Dijon chicken sandwich. Both were delicious, but the chicken was more of an enormous burger than a sandwich. Anyway, it is a no-bull, you're here for the good food kind of diner. The looks is a bit plasticy but if you do not care about the interior much, you'll be OK. It's clean, albeit a bit tight. Food is good and you will definitely not leave hungry!"}
{"text":"Amazing reviews so I had to check out this brunch place. 

The crowd at the door was a good indication of how popular this place is. But we waited among the crowd and at the very front of the crowd and no one greated us. Had no idea what was going on, how long the wait was, whether there was a waitlist etc. When I approached a worker, she gave me a very vague instruction - pointed behind her (which were tables and people) and told me to write down my name. 

On the bright side, food was good. Would want to be back but definitely at a different time."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful breakfast joint at Yonge and st Clair. Every time I've eaten here the food has been fantastic and the service is good. Huge fan of the smoked salmon eggs Benedict (they even have one with cream cheese and capers) and the skillet."}
{"text":"Gord and I had brunch today at Sunny Morning on the Queensway.

They recently expanded into the former sub shop next door and renovated.

Gord love love loves breakfast.  He had bacon 'n eggs and had fruit as his side (for an extra charge).

It's been a while since I've had breakfast.  I had peameal bacon 'n eggs and potatoes as my side.  It was okay.  The eggs could have been cooked a bit more (the whites were runny) and everything but the peameal bacon was a bit cold."}
{"text":"Gord and I have been to Sunny Morning's Etobicoke location for breakfast a few times and have enjoyed it.  I heard this one was near where I work so I checked it out today for lunch.

It's a small spot and it was jammed when I got there about 12:45ish.

Alyssa in the Etobicoke location had recommended the Maple Chipotle BBQ Burger so that's what I ordered today (minus the cheese, onions and lettuce).  I got homefries as my side.  The burger was huge, messy and delicious!  The bun was soft, just the way I like it.  The BBQ was good and had a bit of a bite.  There was so much food that I ate the burger and left most of the homefries.  I'd order it again.

I like Sunny Morning and it's great knowing there is one so close to the office."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to stop by here before work. I ordered the Eggs Benjamin which was delicious and  filling. As for the side, I got their home fries which also tasted great! Can't wait to come back and try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"I try something different every time I go and I'm never disappointed. Plentiful amounts of indulgent breakfast goodness. Very well made and amazingly fast for freshly prepared food.
The staff is great, even when the place gets busy.
Even though it's hard to recommend a single menu item, omelettes and sandwiches are very good, also no need to say anything with bacon or nutella won't disappoint.  

Conveniently located across Canadian Tire, lots of parking space."}
{"text":"I've been to many breakfast places, and besides being so convenient (two blocks from my office and across the subway exit), this traditional breakfast restaurant has good and diverse options both, in size and ingredients. I personally recommend the spinach ricotta omelette (I'm not sure what the name was).  
It's good food, reasonable priced, so they'll be seeing me often there."}
{"text":"Great Freddy sandwich. I wish these breakfast places would offer coffee variety maybe dark and med to answer the demand that's is present in their market"}
{"text":"This was maybe our 6th time here over the last couple years since they have opened (see my earlier review in 2014).  Service as usual was great as was the large menu with plenty of choices.  I went for an item from their light fare - poached eggs with fruit, toast and cottage cheese. They have an interesting way of doing their poached eggs in this dish (looks like you are being served globules of whipped butter rather than eggs :),  I liked it.  Coffee was never ending.  Wife went for their 3 eggs, hash browns and toast with a side of cottage cheese, and was pretty happy as it met her expectations.  Overall, good value for what we ordered and we came away satisfied.  We will continue to frequent this establishment for its bright cheerful ambiance, large menu and excellent service.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"First time at Sunny Morning with my family and we had a good experience. We brought our baby along for lunch on a Sunday and the staff was very friendly and promptly provided us with a highchair. It is a busy restaurant but we didn't wait long to be seated and once we ordered, our food came quickly. Staff was attentive and made several rounds to provide us coffee refills and to check in on us. Food portion was giant! Think American portions. and it tasted great. It is a family friendly restaurant with accomodating staff and wide variety of food choices even a 10month old can enjoy."}
{"text":"I had salad, poached eggs and homefries (I can't eat wheat right now, or I would have had the waffles! They look yum!)

I'm not generally a fan of breakfast, but this was nice. Simple straightforward brekky.  It wasn't a poached egg balanced on a pillar of julienned cukes and carrots, but it hit the spot! 

Homefries are honest, russet potatoes, no special seasoning, just butter and a hot griddle.

Staff are polite, quick and so accommodating, I've never heard so many substitutions in such a small space!

This can quickly become our regular breakfast place"}
{"text":"THE BEST BREAKFAST / BRUNCH PLACE IN ETOBICOKE!

Don't let the fact this place is wedged into a strip mall across from a Canadian Tire fool you, SUNNY MORNING is absolutely fantastic!

Portions are big, food is very high quality, fruit is always fresh, breakfast sausages are never over-cooked... and the staff is wonderful; friendly, fast, courteous, simply delightful!

... and to top everything off it's CHEAP!!!

Sunny Morning will have you questioning the Q, letting The Grill cool, and making Cora just another one of your ex-girlfriends that you used to do brunch with... it's seriously one of my favorite breakfast places I've ever been to!

EDIT:  Since writing this review, I've had the chance to sample something called \"Freddie's Caramel Waffle\" on the SM menu.  I don't generally like sweet breakfasts, but this is to die for!  The caramel has just the right amount of sweetness and is complimented with nuts and a plentiful portion of bananas all over them and some whipped cream if you wish.  It's the best waffle I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"This place is seriously amazing. And I mean AMAZING!

We stumbled upon Sunny Morning when we were looking for a brunch place around Sherway Gardens. It instantly became one of my favourite breakfast and brunch places ever.

The service is super friendly and quick. The menu - very impressive. Food - simply exceptional. The Nutella Dream Waffle is mind blowing. Just thinking about it makes me drool. We also tried traditional breakfast - eggs, omelettes, etc (we've never been disappointed!) but it's the Nutella Dream where it's at. I think our next trip to Sunny Morning is in order."}
{"text":"Came in on Thanksgiving with my partner for breakfast. This restaurant has 4 stars and I live around the area, so why not give it a shot. It was pretty busy when we got there around 10ish. We decided to stay on the patio and enjoy the nice weather. Our server greeted us after about 5 mins. She was pleasant :). I got the vegetarian omelette with mixed fruits on the side and my partner got the classic bacon and egg with harsh brown.The serving were pretty big and loved it!!!!!   The food were delicious!!! Half way through eating my omelette, I saw a pice of ham :( I was disappointment and did not finish my food. I told the server and she apologized, told the manager and was taken off from our bill. Everything else were good aside from the meat on my food."}
{"text":"Great place for a weekend morning or any morning really. Come early as it gets packed fast. Amazing staff and food comes out fast. Coffee is never burned. I had the western omelette sandwich. I love it and can't go wrong with that decision every time. Love it. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best breakfast in town!

Gave it a 4 instead of 5 strictly over the noise capacity. Picked a Sunday morning breakfast. Should have taken the patio seats I guess. 

Service is super fast, friendly, and efficient. Portions are huge. Come hungry. Ie: 5 slices of bacon appose to 3 and 4 links of sausages appose to 3. Options on the menu are standard with a few neat treats. *funky chunky pancakes...chocolate waffles whip cream*

Going to try mid week breakfast to compare business from the weekend.

Parking lot parking. Outside patio. Average prices. Open everyday 7am-3pm

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"With limited brunch selection in Aurora, Sunny Morning is a great addition to the neighbourhood. 

Having to been spoiled by the downtown brunch scene for the past 6 Years, I was quite sad for not being able to find a good brunch place in Aurora.  Although the food and service is very good here, it is still just your typical egg dishes. You won't find creative dishes here such as avo toast with poach eggs and arugula, shashuka or even a potato waffle egg Benny that I miss so much from starving artist.  Maybe one day...but until then , this will be my go to brunch place for now."}
{"text":"Such a great spot for Toronto breakfast. Long wait if your there Sunday morning but worth the wait. Food was amazing and service was just as amazing. Americans-get the bacon you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"3.5 place. Kind of reminds me of Cora's in a sense. Bright and sunny (just like the name) with not so bad prices. 

Fried egg, cheddar and bacon on whole wheat with a classic side (homefries) $6-7 not bad, I enjoyed it but nothing special with the homefries. The food was pretty much something I could make at home. 

BLT sandwich with side of fresh fruit $5-6 plus $2 for the fruit. Nothing crazy good, but the portion for the fruits was a good amount.

Strawberries and banana on waffle was around $10-11 and comes with whipped cream. It was not bad! They put a healthy amount of fruits on top so definitely a point to them! 

Got our food really fast and service was good. 

Not a bad place to just grab some brekky but can't say there's anything that stands out."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast the other day and really enjoyed the quality of the food and the service. 

The menu is standard breakfast items, omelets, bacon/sausage and egg, pancakes, waffles, etc... I got a meal that came with pancakes, egg, sausage and bacon and homefries, and it was a massive amount of food for around $13 if I can remember. Everything was hot and fresh tasting and I really enjoyed this meal. Everyone else enjoyed their meals as well and noticed the good quality of the ingredients. If you want to substitute your home fries, you can get a nice mix of fruit which looked really nice a fresh. I also tried some of the nutella pancake and they were delicious, generously topped with strawberries and nutella; definitely not for someone on a diet! 

The service was prompt and friendly, everything came out quickly and was hot. Refills of coffee and water were regular and there were no issues with service at all.

The place looks like a standard breakfast place, classic sticky floor and wooden tables. It's a small place so expect a wait on a sunday morning if you come during peak breakfast times. Prices are standard, a bit on higher side by maybe $2-3 higher compared to sunset grill, but I think the quality is slightly better. Overall a good place, i'll return, I had my eyes on the eggs benedict so i'd like to try that next!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Sunny Morning. We actually decided to check it out because of it's proximity to Ikea, since we planned to visit there anyway.

We sat on the patio and were greeted by our waiter shortly after sitting down. We ordered ice water and he brought it over straight away.  He gave us a few moments to look at the menu and then took our order.

We didn't have to wait long for our food, which was delivered by two servers. My son ordered the chicken Caesar salad with a side order of home fries, which are reported to be hand-cooked, not deep-fried. The serving size of the salad was definitely very generous and the chicken pieces were nicely seasoned with what tasted like a herb rub. The dressing was lacking in acid, but very creamy. The bacon in the salad was a maple bacon, so a bit too sweet and also very salty.  The home fries were okay. They weren't particularly tasty and honestly were nothing special.

My husband ordered the sausages and eggs with a side of green salad with balsamic dressing. The salad was very nice and fresh and the dressing was delicious. The eggs were perfectly cooked (sunny side up). The sausages were typical breakfast sausages but were a bit on the salty side.

I ordered the Eggs Freddy (Benedict) without the English muffins as there was no gluten-free option available and I try to avoid wheat. They were served on top of peameal bacon which was cooked perfectly and the poached eggs were lovely and runny. The hollandaise was also delicious albeit a little salty. I also had the side salad with balsamic, which was fresh and very tasty.

One of the highlights of the meal however was the good service. Our waiter (Corey) was extremely friendly and solicitous. He came over to check on us several times and noticed things like water glasses needing to be refilled, despite the restaurant being extremely busy.

All in all, the food was pretty good (service was very good) and we would return. We all thought different parts of our meal were too salty and we are a family who isn't afraid of salt, so that's saying something. Otherwise, it was good and we look forward to trying other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and I'm from Texas! Very very good breakfast and a large menu with an awesome selection. It was really good and I would highly recommend to anyone visiting or that lives there. Great atmosphere and very delicious food!"}
{"text":"Sunny Morning is your standard all day breakfast dinner.  What they do they do well and the service is good.  I am cutting back on calories and red meat and I hope they will expand their healthier options soon."}
{"text":"Saturday morning at 1130. What was I thinking? The place was slammed. Waiting time about 10 minutes. 
Kudos to staff for being organized and quick. Had my usual hungry teen breaky and my lovely lady had eggs and sausage. 
The food was lovely, fresh and service was quick. 
Two thumbs up. Good job."}
{"text":"Stopped here immediately after leaving the airport after a red eye flight. I had the French toast combo with fruit. The fruit that came with my meal was a meal in itself, it was huge and really took the edge off! Coffee could be a bit stronger but more than made up for with plentiful refills, ample syrup on the table and perfectly cooked bacon. Perfect breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"Great service. 
Good variety. 
 Quality and good portions.
I like how they don't dip their fruits into sugar syrup.  
Better come before 9am on a weekend, this place packs up pretty fast."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Sunny Morning. One, because it was one of the few places open on Easter weekend and because the typical breakfast items, with an elevated twist in ginormus portions, are quite reasonably priced in a city where most essentials tend not to be (read \"marked up by $3-5\"). Wanting something not easily found in the U.S., I ordered a ham omelette with pesto (there's a fancier name for it which you'll have to search the menu for). I smiled like one does on a sunny morning when I realized what it really was. I do so like green eggs and ham. Thank you. Thank you, Sam-I-am. 

4.5 stars for menu variety, the convenient Yonge St. location and decent value."}
{"text":"Meh, the food here is cheap but not worth your hard earned dollars. We ordered the Freddie (egg's Benedict) and it was alright. I would give the food 3 stars, but for the trek from downtown Toronto, you could just as go to the Senator for breakfast. The diner inside is a bit small and service was atrociously slow. Overall, the cost of breakfast for two was $30, which isn't bad. But value-wise, I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The bacon is why I go! I don't need to say much but they're a big portion and always crispy! I usually get the fruit cup with bacon on the side but I got the Nutella dream French toast and it didn't disappoint. If you go make sure you have their fresh-squeezed orange juice! I'm gonna go there over and Over again!"}
{"text":"We went there today for the first time after reading the positive reviews here on Yelp and we left very satisfied! 

Ambiance: 
Small place tucked between other shops on Yonge street just off Saint Clair Avenue. It's in a very nice location with lots of things going on. The first thing you'd notice when you walk in is how small it is - but it's more of a cosy small than an uncomfortable small. Very diner-ish feel.

Food: 
We ordered two things to share: the Eggs Benjamin and The Lumberjack. The Eggs Benjamin was poached eggs atop smoked salmon on an English muffin. We asked for hollandaise sauce on the side just because usually restaurants tend to overdo how much they pour over the eggs. The Lumberjack consisted of three eggs and two pancakes. Both meals came with a classic side and we went with home fries for both of them. Both the choices had a very good taste, the home fries weren't too salty, the pancakes were nice and fluffy and the eggs were made well. 

Price: 
It came to about $12-$13 per person. It probably will be less expensive than many other places. It's also possible to get much simpler breakfasts for much less. 

Menu:
Breakfast and lunch. Everything from omelettes to french toast to burgers and sandwiches.

Overall:
I'll be seeing them again!"}
{"text":"The server DOES LOOK LIKE PAUL RUDD!! After reading our Yelp leader Kris' review of this breakfast joint, I knew that I had to try it. There were two of us plus 2 babies and they gave us the huge booth by the kitchen so that our babies won't fall off the wooden chairs. In the few minutes that I waited for my friend to arrive, I was asked 3 times by 2 different servers if I wanted a beverage. I ordered the salmon eggs benedict with home fries, while my friend had the smoked salmon omelette. My poached eggs were cooked to perfection, the yolk oozing over my salmon and English muffin. The servers were attentive and constantly offered to top up our coffees - maybe because they figured us moms need to run on caffeine!! There is a change table in the bathroom and the restaurant and bathroom were clean. My breakfast plus the unlimited coffee, plus tax and tip was just shy of $20. It is pricy, but for the service and maybe to relax out on the patio when it gets warmer out, it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends for brunch after a night out. We wanted a restaurant with good breakfast food and a good variety on the menu - and this place delivered.

The menu had lots of options: traditional breakfasts, egg scrambles, omelets, French toast, pancakes, waffles, and even a list of healthier choices. I got a Popeye egg scramble (tomato, feta, onion, and spinach) with toast and had the option of ordering fruit on the side instead of potatoes for $2 extra, which I liked. The scramble tasted fresh and the fruit bowl was well worth the extra money. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their meals too.

The only downside is that it's a really small, cramped place and they may have problems seating larger parties. There also might be a long wait, although we only had to wait about 10 minutes and it was a Sunday at noon, so it wasn't really too bad."}
{"text":"Meh

Concentrate OJ

Undercooked over medium (un-jellied) 

Burnt bacon 

Dry flapjacks 

Low grade syrup 

Frozen home fries 

...But my cup of joe was decent ???

Sigh. Come on Toronto. This is a good brunch experience?

I RECOMMEND- making breakfast at home. This was a fail in every way. 

EXTRA TIP- small location, expect a lineup on weekends. No host but friendly waitresses."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast joint. I'm so glad this place opened up because it's such a money saver than going to Cora's. Normally for 2 people here, the bill is less than $30 where at Coras it can add up to $50!! 

I always get the staple sausage & eggs with tomato slices and it never fails. Ive also tried their pancakes (fluffy & delicious), eggs florentine (comes with spinach and I believe feta cheese) and a salad entree (was meh, wouldn't order again). 

Other than the food, I just want to really acknowledge their staff. Ever since this place first opened, their waiters and waitresses are so nice and attentive! They don't keep bugging us with questions but at the same time refill items when needed. Makes me want to keep coming back for their awesome customer service and really reasonable prices :)"}
{"text":"Awesome..... 

You definitely gotta eat here. 

WHY hasn't food network done a story on this awesome restaurant?"}
{"text":"It's a clean modern breakfast place. We went around noon so thank goodness we didn't have to wait in line. The tables can be small if one orders a lot. 

The service was good and the food came out quicker than anticipated. 

My veggie omelette came with toast and home fries which are not fried. However, if you want to sub for fruits it's gonna cost you. Whereas other breakfast place (like Cora's) already has plenty of fruits included in most dishes. The omelette was full of veggies which is nice to see. The disappointment was the potatoes which was soft and too dark for my liking. I've had better breakfast potatoes, like at Panagio's. 

My partner had egg Benedict with smoked salmon and he said it was alright. Nothing big stood out. He did mention that Bistro Narra knows how to do their Benedict right! 

Verdict: I wouldn't go back unless I'm meeting friends there or around that neighbourhood. The good thing is that there are plenty of parking spaces."}
{"text":"Very big clean open restaurant!
Lots of space on the patio too!
The service was amazing but the food was just average.
Portions were really big!
My fiancé's eggs weren't fully cooked. We told the waiter she was very helpful.

Not much to say.
Just a breakfast place with a large menu!"}
{"text":"My kind of place, my kind of breakfast. In AND OUT quick. Clean, bright, hot food, big portions I couldn't finish. I had maple syrup all over my fingers, asked for a wet wipe they didn't have, any was brought watered me paper towel. It's not very big on the inside so they don't have a  space for groups but I heard them say they were taking a group of 10 for lunch. If you're in the Young and St. Clair area and looking for hot quick relatively inexpensive breakfast check it out!"}
{"text":"I've been here for too long not to leave any review. It's always a good time going there. Tried a lot of items on the menu already and it's always a delight! Customer service is usually nice but poor on busy days. I was literally forgotten one day I had to flag down someone else for my bill, manager was nice enough to comp me for that though. Overall nice place and I will definitely keep going back !!"}
{"text":"If I had only come here on Mother's Day, this spot would have received a 5 star. Although we waited long (anticipated and normal for a busy day and holiday such as Mother's day), it wasn't a painful wait.

We were greeted by a nice gentleman who took our name and how many hungry folks we were with and gave us a realistic timeline of how long the wait was going to be. 30 minutes aka 30 stomach growls per minute. It was fine. We decided to wait. He came back 15 minutes later and said the wait would be actually closer to 40..but again, it as fine.

We were seated at a nice large table and were immediately attended by our sweet server. I got the Hungry Teen and it was DELICIOUS. I enjoyed everything and the pancakes and all were mouthwatering, flavourful, fluffy and hot! 

With the sweet service, delicious food and pleasant atmosphere, a month later my Mom, aunt and cousin decided to give this another round as our \"girls brunch\".

I was disappointed with this visit SOLELY based on our under cooked pancakes. The batter was still raw on the inside (even though the outside was golden). Not just my pancakes, but my aunts and my moms. 

The server and manager were respectful and brought back another batch but only to find out- same thing. Raw baby. :( 

They did discount our bill (by 50%) which was far more generous than they should have. It was just disappointing that we raved about these fantastic pancakes that sadly enough couldn't even have been consumed. Unless of course, I wanted a date with the toilet that day.

I may give this place another try and opt for the skillet instead :)"}
{"text":"Decided to do brunch with a friend while on the go one Sunday morning. This isn't a place that you'll come across while driving, it's a little hidden, but totally worth it. The service was great. The servers were clean, kind and attentive. The food was great for brunch. There were lots of great lunch and breakfast options. Nutella is their thing and they do it so well. I had the Nutella croissant French toast. The only reason I took a star away is because I found the place quite crowded when busy and the side dishes were a tad pricey. Also, we both found the breakfast potatoes a little bland. I'll definitely return to try other things on the menu. If you're in the area, go check it out."}
{"text":"I always get the best impression everytime.

Everyone I come to this place the service is top notch.  The servers are always happy and helpful.  There was one time my family of eight showed and the restaurant was full the server was nice and got us setup in a few minutes.  The server moved two newly vacant tables together and put my family of eight together.  It was smooth and quick.

The food is so good and at great prices.  I have had only the savoury dishes and looking forward to trying the sweet dishes too.  The portions are a good size and fresh.  

Overall experience is very good and excellent service from the moment you walk in to the final greeting as you walk out.

Great place!"}
{"text":"Visited Sunny Morning for brunch and ordered the Eggs Benedict and the Nutella Waffles. The food arrived quickly and was quite delicious.

This breakfast place is definitely worth the visit but I would recommend coming early as there will most likely be a wait.  The service is fast and the table turn around is definitely quick.

We waited approximately 15-20 minutes for a table for two which is pretty impressive for this small restaurant.  A gentleman named Rusty came in and tried to smooth talk his way into a table- apparently he has been trying to eat here for over a month.  Rusty was finally seated at the expense of his date.

Rusty and I both give this restaurant two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast restaurant  that opens until 3pm.  A nice, bright and sunny place when the sun is out.  First impression is that the restaurant is clean.  Lots of seats - you choose where you want to park yourself.
There are lots of choices on the menu, including custom-made omelettes of your fancy.  I believe the produce are locally originated.  I decided on a traditional breakfast of 4 sausages and scrambled eggs.  There are also 4 choices of sides to choose from: salad, home fries, tomatoes and fruit salad.  I decided on the salad.  All that plus bread costs $8.99 + tax.  
Other than a slightly slow service, everything else is on point."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast/brunch with my friend, I got the Mediterranean omelette (egged whites) and it comes with toast and homefries, it was all delicious, very filling, I had to take half to go. Very fresh veggies, home fries were not burnt not under cooked the omelette, was lovely and fluffy. My friend got the lumber jack, which is sausage bacon, eggs,homefries and pancakes! It was great! Lots of food, for a great price, eggs were cooked to perfection, staff were very friendly and on the ball. Filled up our coffee and water before it was empty, just the way I like it. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. But kinda small and very well known. Arrive early to avoid disappointment! 

Had \"The Lumberjack\". Generous serving and definitely filling. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"came here with my best friend for breakfast on one of my days off recently, and it was a really great choice. walked in and got served right away and the service was top notch, once settling in and looking at the menu I couldn't help but see all of the \"main\" options available for this place, pancakes, omelettes, combo's. a lot of great main options, sadly I was a little bit confused as to why they didn't have any bagel options at all, or bagel with salmon is a must in my books for a breakfast option. also I was a little bit confused as to the lack of side options. for example extra bacon, or sausage, or ham??!. placed our order and within a couple of minutes we had our food, everything was hot and fresh, literally devoured the food down with ease, and left feeling very satisfied. couldn't help but notice that this place doesn't have any T.V.'s, which would suck if you came to this location and couldn't hold a conversation. the outside patio is a nice touch for the months when it is nice outside. lots of parking is available at this location, but be cautious as drivers are whipping in and out of here, and the Canadian tire lot as well. thje hours that this place is open is not something to be happy about either, if you don't work or live in the area, chances are you will never come here, as they are closed by 3pm daily. 
would come back if I was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Having an amazing time with great people! Simply love their waffles and bacon and my son loves French Nutella. Great place!"}
