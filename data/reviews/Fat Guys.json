{"text":"Fat guys is a great local joint! The food is awesome! The pizza is dynamite! We often get it carryout!  While I don't recommend it for children we've gone for a quick early bite. My sons love the chicken wings sweet n tangy to be exact!  The owner is friendly & staff is Nice! As for parking those who think its a challenge or poor have never gone to the flats or Lakewood.. It a working class bar with awesome food!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and inhaled The Danny Burger. Outstanding burger! Amy was dispensing beverages in all her beauty. Nice lunch crowd along with the usual KENO patrons. If your in the Old Brooklyn area, make it your destination to experience a great neighborhood tavern."}
{"text":"I was prepared to be disappointed and I wasn't! This place has fantastic food. We all split the boneless wings (sweet&tangy, hot BBQ and garlic butter parm) best boneless wings and sauces EVER! The appetizer sampler was decent, chili cheese fries, chicken strips, poppers and mozzarella sticks (3 of each). My bf had the fat guy burger and he loved it, the thing was HUGE! My brother had a smaller burger, equally as delish and I had the crazy dogs: 2 hot dogs with chili, cheese, cole slaw and a side of fries $4.99. Prices were so cheap it to begin with and happy hour = 1/2 price appetizer SCORE!!! Kind of a strange crowd and definatly not the prettiest place, but definatly awesome food and I'd go back anyday! Thumbs Up"}
{"text":"CLOSED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Whiskey Tango Foxtrot!!! The place was always hopping too... What gives???"}
{"text":"I simply love this place. Very casual atmosphere with great staff and friendly owner, and hands down, the best burgers and fresh hand-cut fries I have ever eaten. I've done my fair share of traveling and eating in restaurants-the BEST I've ever eaten! A+++++++++"}
{"text":"We went there because we had a half off coupon not knowing what to expect.  Yes, it was a dive bar (complete with a loud drunk guy sitting at the bar) but I was very surprised that the food was as good as it was.  The calzone was extra tasty and full of ingredients. Done just right.  We also tried the burger wrap sandwich and it was also very good. There were tons of people picking up to go orders during our time there.  Parking is tough because they don't have a parking lot, per se. You have to park across the street.  I might or might not go back only because it's a bit too \"divey\" for me but if they spruced up the inside a bit I would probably go back just for the food."}
{"text":"Cod dinner was good. Coleslaw wasn't that great. parking was a challenge."}
