{"text":"We came here for a Chinese banquet rehearsal dinner and nearly left in a food coma! 

I won't lie, I was a bit skeptical about the venue given its location but once inside it was clearly a great choice! The restaurant is located on the second floor of the Holiday Inn express in Chinatown. The exterior is nothing fancy, but once you walk inside, the lobby has a large pond with a maze-like bridge to get from one side to the other. The restaurant is open to the pond area and the lobby. Off to the side you'll find a couple of banquet rooms which can be used for private events like ours. 

The venue was perfect for our party, there was a small area just outside the dining room where we were able to use as a cocktail area.  Once we sat down for dinner, the event was perfectly private and food started flowing (and nearly didn't stop). We had over 10 courses. No, that's not a typo, yes we had 11 courses... Luckily my dress was flowy. Even with the dress handicap I had trouble pacing myself. Every dish was traditionally delicious. I can't list them all or this review would never end, but a few faves: the BBQ platter which included chicken and duck, the Cantonese shrimp croquettes, deep fried crispy chicken and the fried live lobster. 

I had to take a couple of breaks in between courses to walk it off and make room for the 7 more to go! Luckily they had the cute little pond area where I could do laps."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Holiday Inn Express and decided to check out the restaurant.  My husband, daughter and I decided to get their full dinners.  We had either wonton soup or hot and sour soup (both were delightful);  spring rolls the main course and dessert.  I don't remember what the main course was called but it was chicken cooked in a tempura with a yellow sauce.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly as well as rice.  For dessert we had cake with some fresh fruit.  We all felt very satisfied with our meals.  They were flavorful and well prepared.  Our waiter was very polite and attentive.  I think that it was our best meal for our entire trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Chinese food I've ever had. At primo prices. The Singaporean noodles have meat, even though that's not in the description. The replacement vegetarian noodle dish we ordered came with a sauce that was so gelatinous it looked like snot stuck to the veggies. And the fried fish withauce - laughable. Disgusting little nuggets of mostly soggy fry batter that had the texture of wet fingers in a bright orange sweet sauce unlike any other Sichuan sauce I've ever had. 

The ma√Ætre'd is a pleasure, working so hard to make the experience enjoyable. The server was not so nice; speaking down to me like I was an idiot when I asked questions about the menu. Me: \"does the fried tofu come with any sauce?\" Him: \"in Chinese food, there is never a sauce.\" What?

Overall: stay away. There is a reason that this 200+ seat restaurant only had 5 tables occupied on a Saturday night."}
