{"text":"Truly enjoyed the experience.   Delicious food with fair prices and pleasant personable staff.  They made my Birthday experience special.  The dessert was scrumptious.  If you are in the city and want an authentic Italian cuisine experience,  check out Il Gatto Nero.  Thanks for making my Birthday dinner amazing."}
{"text":"Food was ok, I'd come back for the food if it wasn't for the service. They were nice enough when we came in, we ordered and got our food pretty quick. The server never came to see how we liked the food, never came to ask about more drinks, even though the cups were empty, when she came to pick up the plates we ASKED for some espressos (which weren't  very good) we then waited for about 15 minutes after we finished where she was just walking around behind the bar before we gave up and went to the bar to get the bill. I would have understood everything taking longer if it was busy, but it wasnt. It might be a good place to go for drinks, not somewhere I'd go back though"}
{"text":"El Gatto Nero means \"The Black Cat\" in Spanish and I dig it.I have friends from out of town who are super devoted tot his joint, which is usually how I end up there. It's great eating for the price. The bar is lively for both dinner and drinks and there's plenty of tables and most important, the 905 factor is low even on a Friday night on College St."}
{"text":"This spot serves Italian food but it's tastes really cheap... They have five pasta dishes to choose from - our table had two that were recommended, and they were both terrible.   Tomato sauce in fusili pasta had no flavour, was salty,  was supposed to have peppers and basil, but didn't see any....and the pasta was really hard (and not in a good el dente sort of way). It reminded me of those crappy jars of sauce from the grocery store - not even the good $8 jars of sauce at Longos or the new Italian rack at Loblaws - the cheap ones in the middle of the store that are always on sale because nobody buys them.    Wouldn't recommend or return. They have lots of pizzas that sound popular, but with all of the good pizzerias in town, don't see a point.....   Shout outs  to nice waitress who took crappy pasta off our bill!"}
{"text":"I've been to Il Gatto Nero on a few occasions and I love coming here. It's not over the top like many of the restaurants on college. They are not trying to prove anything.  I enjoy the simplicity of their menu and the thought out flavors they add to their dishes.  I've tried a variety of items on the menu from pasta to pizza to their spinelli (no longer on the menu) and I've never been disappointed.  The bar adds a bit of casual to the atmosphere but the dim lighting and candles on the tables add a bit of romance.  The bar is a hangout amongst regulars and those just catching a quick drink or dinner.    I'll continue to come here because it's easy, casual and has always been inviting."}
{"text":"Everything's classy about this place accept the manner in which the owner treats customers.   I had lunch at Il Gatto Nero on a Sat afternoon when the place was totally empty. When the owner saw that I've finished my meal and started using my laptop, he handed me the bill and began complaining every 10 min that I'm using up power and taking up space. \"You gonna sit here all day and use power? We got people coming \"  This was an unpleasant experience. I wouldn't recommend this place. The food was actually very mediocre."}
{"text":"Just had a glass of wine and a beer but, we'll be back here - great atmosphere and service is supuerb!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the neighbourhood and decided to just walk down college to find a restaurant for my mother and stumbled upon Il Gatto Nero. We ordered the mushroom pizza and a salad to share (sorry I forget the actual names). It was delicious! I was expecting a personal size pizza but it was definitely large enough to split. The salad was light and refreshing and the pizza had an amazingly thin crust. Overall I am very happy with the food here.  The reason i am not giving it five stars is because the service we received was just OK.  Relaxed atmosphere, casual, family friendly - would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"J'y suis allé une seule fois. Il semblerait que le serveur était en fin de service, il était particulièrement désagréable, alors nous sommes partis.   C'était il y a 4 ans, comme quoi, le service, ça compte non?"}
{"text":"This place is the shits it's run by Portugese that are rasist ever time I go there for a coffee I get dirty looks I don't go there any more."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday. We had an hour for lunch so we ordered almost as soon as we got there. There were only another couple of people there when we arrived, and for a good 20 minutes into our visit, the place was pretty quiet. Well, we waited, and waited, and waited... We finally had to leave without our meal; colleagues staying behind agreed to bring our food to our workplace. When we went to pay for our meal before leaving, we were all charged an 18% gratuity!  Yes, 18% for services not rendered! The food was mediocre at best, but you wouldn't think if from the exorbitant prices.As if that weren't enough, the main server, a tall woman with dark hair, was nothing short of rude and dismissive. I will NEVER visit this dive again.Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Located on the corner of College and Crawford, Il Gatto Nero is one of the trademarks of Little Italy. We came here on a Saturday night and ordered 2 salads, 2 pastas and a pizza to share between 7 of us. That was the perfect amount of food. Our favourite was the salad with pine nuts."}
{"text":"Great for dinner and espresso's. Since i work close by I get an espresso almost every week now - its cool how the name means black cat!"}
{"text":"I came to Il gatto nero during the taste of little italy festival. The menu they offered was limited, most of them are pizza-related.  My friend ordered the gnocchi and ravioli, and the portions are quite small for $15. I ordered the anchovy pizza, which comes with a nice thinly crusted pizza, with tomatoe sauce on top and all-too-salty anchovies. I was too busy chuggin down water to wash away the saltiness of the anchovies to even enjoy anything about the pizza.  This might be a good place to sit down and have coffee and wine, but definitely not a place to get a meal."}
{"text":"It's ok. Nothing special. The food is good. The staff are so-so. The vibe is boring, but it's a decent place to hang out if you just want to grab a bite, talk with your guests, and not feel pressured to pay and leave. I'm sure there are better places along that street however."}
{"text":"This place is hilarious. It's so local and cosy but the female bartenders and waitresses are downright hostile. They don't seem to comprehend - mean scowls and walking away while YOU'RE STILL PLACING YOUR ORDER equals crappy tips. Your only job is to wear short shorts and take orders. I find myself constantly baffled by the service. Don't bother with the tired salads - pizzas are ok - but so many other places are better like Utopia !"}
{"text":"*****THIS PLACE IS REALLY 2.5 STARS*****  Whenever I go out I always find, and this is specially true in Little Italy since there are so many  Resto/Lounge/Bar/Bistro combos right next to each other, that they all tend to fall under three main categories.  A-) Great food, love the place.  B-) Great food, place is alright. C-) Food is not all that but the place has a great vibe.  IGN falls under the latter as I have walked by this bistro for years and during many of those walks, I actually stopped to look at their menu and the only thing that came to mind was 'Man, that patio sure looks like a great place to have a cold one.'  A few times I have gone there and done just that and had a really nice time. Chat with a friend, had the odd smoke, do a little bit of people watching, all in all, good times.   Only twice did I go through the trouble of looking at the menu and it is pretty standard fare for this side of town. Some Pollo and Margharita pizzas, maybe some veggies thrown in for good measure, some cheese/chicken/seafood pasta... But not enough to warrant the price plus last time I was there, the server seemed to be having a bad day, alas, I digress. The rest of the menu looked very pedestrian, yet most items were near the $20 mark, which is a no-no if you are asking almost $20 per dish.    Honestly I can barely remember the pizzas we ordered. However I do remember the inviting old-world-looking bar made out of darkish wood, stacked bottles of wine behind it. What felt like high ceilings and hardwood floors and the great corner patio with a tree at the very corner where you can sit beneath its shade during hot afternoons. Ah... Add a glass of dry, smoky white wine/or a cold {insert drink of choice here}, pair it with some good conversation and you are set.   Personally, I see Il Gatto Nero to be more for an espresso or apéritif kind of place, so do yourself a favor and check it out, just don't come hungry."}
{"text":"I haven't been here since last fall and I was a little weary after reading the past few negative reviews... I warned my friends and we decided to sit on the patio and have a couple of drinks and a pizza. I do believe I met the rude waitress/greeter ... she seated us. Miserable scowl on her face (would not want to be related to her - sourpuss!!!) That was the only negative. We were greeted by our waitress immediately with menus and she came back immediately once we sere settled to ask if we wanted a drink. We took our time ordering the pizza and once we did it came out within 15 - 20 minutes and it was sizzling hot fresh and tasty, the crust was perfectly cooked. The service was impeccable and our waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. The staff are attentive and do their job well. Their food is wonderful. You get the same types of pizza's you'd get in Rome, Florence, and Napoli. Its the best. Its just down the street from my place and their prices aint bad at all."}
{"text":"Forgot how good pizzas are here.  Delicious! Great espresso too. No clue why it only has 3 stars! staff was friendly, prompt and had great suggestions!"}
{"text":"In the heart of little italy is this gem of a restaurant.  We went in for a pre-show concert meal. This place has a bright casual look in its decor and ambience. The menu is Italian food consisting of pizzas, pastas and appetizers. You get complimentary bread with olive oil & balsamic vinegar to dip with your meal.  I ordered the Quattro stagioni Pizza, 2 orders of arancini which is rice balls, that are formed into balls and quickly deep-fried; also ordered an appetizer of Meatballs which came with only two medium size.   The pizza was absolutely delicious was fresh just enough sauce to cover the dough and lots of cheese and toppings on mine; it was enough to share with two people or even three.  Homemade dough, pizza oven in the back of restaurant.  The arancini were delicious, aborio  rice cooked soft and outer coating thin crispy. The only thing I was disappointed about is not to find any meat or peas or cheese stuffed inside; it really simply was just rice but it was delicious I just wish they would stuff there's. The sauce that it comes with was a perfect marinara sauce mild tomato flavor balance just right.  The appetizer meatballs were very lean but delicious and again with the nice marinara sauce. I wish it wasn't so lean but that's just my preference.  Service was quick,efficient and friendly just a note it was not  busy at the time we went.  My table ordered two pints of beer which was decently priced for only $6.50 + $7.00.   I would definitely recommend and go back when I'm in the area. I'm giving this place 4 stars out of five;  the only reason they lost one star it's because of the non stuffed Arancini and 2 meatballs (expected 3 atleast  for $8)."}
{"text":"Solid one and a half star place, if you're looking to add one of those to your rotation, though I'd caution against it.   Stopped here on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. Only came here because all the other Italian places in little Italy were closed (at 2 pm on a Sunday?? Whaaa?) and we were jonesing for some pasta. Food was bad, service was atrocious, decor was boring. Broken down for ya below:  Food: we had a simple pasta (mozz and basil and tomato sauce) and a pizza with goat cheese, roasted red peppers, and prosciutto. The pasta was fine but overpriced and bland, and the pizza was soggy and the ingredients looked cheap (the prosciutto was off-color and tough).   Service: had to ask for more water twice and waited 12 minutes with an empty table before we got up and had to physically flag down our check  Decor: feels like a nicer version of your doctor's waiting room  Overall, would not recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner this past weekend, and although the service was the weak link in the experience, we still had a pretty enjoyable time.  The beer list on tap isn't great, but includes some local Toronto brews like Steamwhistle and Amsterdam Blonde and some international staples like Stella so you should be able to find something adequate.  We started with an app which was some sort of iteration of breaded pieces of eggplant with sauce and cheese over it. Definitely recommended! Then we both tried Spinellis, which is kind of like a big wrap made with really thin pizza dough and filled with various ingredients. We got one with prosciutto and some veggies and one with sausage and veggies. We we're actually surprised by how big they ended up being, and even split them half and half to try each of them.  Both were pretty good. Toppings inside were an adequate amount, but admittedly could've had more meat to really push the flavours... But they were pretty good and even ended up taking some home for leftover which reheated quite nicely.  All in all about 4 pints and 2 mains and an app, I believe came to around $72 after tax before tip. I'd come back and do it all over again, although utilize the patio when the summer weather has approached."}
{"text":"Just a quick one on Il Gatto Nero, as I don't feel I have much to add beyond what's already been said.  As indicated by the two stars, I fall on the negative side.  Nothing was bad, so don't get me wrong, it's just that \"good\" doesn't really compensate for slow service.  Would I go back if someone was holding an event here?  Sure.  Would I go out of my way?  Definitely not -- there are plenty of better options within walking distance, and plenty of ones I've yet to try, that I wouldn't give IGN another chance any time soon.  For the record, salad, panini, a basic pasta (as I recall, mozza, tomato, basil, etc), espressos, and wine between the two of us."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant with a bucolic view (in the summer). You'll feel in Italy. Good pasta and pizza. Truly enjoyed our meal and drinks in this lovely cafe. Friendly servers."}
{"text":"This corner restaurant is located right in Little Italy and is a cute place for an intimate dinner or coffee date. My friends and I came on a Sunday evening for dinner. We ordered a pizza, two pastas, and two salads to share among the 6 of us. It was just enough to fill us up and leave us room for drinks (we were going to a bar afterwards).  We got the pizza with prosciutto, mushrooms, egg, and truffle oil but couldn't really taste the truffle in it. Both the rucola salad and insalata gatto nero we ordered were very good and appetizing. I especially liked the roasted pine nuts in the latter. The pasta was okay - it was just a bit too hard for my taste. I like my pasta al dente.  All in all, it's a cute place with decent food and a nice atmosphere. I'd come back again for coffee or dessert."}
{"text":"Very good value and delicious simple Italian fare. Delicious salads, pizzas and the calamari is killer. It's a casual low key place so don't expect fine dining service, but I have always found them attentive and friendly. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I have used yelp for a long time now, but decided to finally post a review. A Toronto native recommended this place to me, but I was terribly disappointed. I ordered a Margherita pizza, but what I received was anything but that. The pizza had no basil, no tomato slices, nor any mozzarella slices. It consisted of a thin, burnt crust pizza and oily cheese. I asked where the basil was and the waitress said 'oh, the chef must have forgot the basil garnish'. Suffice it to say, I'd choose another Italian restaurant in the area. They can't be worse than what I experienced."}
{"text":"We sat on the side patio.  It was very nice.  The service was exceedingly friendly.  I had the Carmine Calzone (tomato, mozzarella, onions, hot peppers & prosciutto).  This was one of the better calzones I've had in recent years.  The crust was just right.  The ingredients all came together very well.  and it totally avoided the sogginess that is pervasive in many calzones.  If I lived in Toronto, I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  The food here is very tasteless.   Our dinner took quite a while to come and was very mediocre.     We had a bread and fior di latte cheese,  this was very tasteless and greasy.   They should know that is tasteless.   I know the cheese doesn't have much taste,  but I assumed they did something to make it more tasty.   They didn't !   Why would they serve this!  then we had halibut,  it looked pretty but was over cooked and tasteless as well.   No sauce or anything.   Just dry.  I would never go back to this restaurant.    They need to start over..."}
{"text":"I ride my bike along College almost every day on the way to work, so I've had a good look at many of the restaurants without actually trying them.    Little Italy!  Unfortunately it's not a good idea to drink wine and ride a bike, and no Italian food is truly complete without a nice glass of red.  So I hadn't had a chance to try anything as I sped by each day.  Eventually, through careful deliberation, I got to the hood without the bike, and faced an abundance of possible candidates for saturday lunch.  I originally intended to make it to Kensington Market to try one of the Mexican places, but as my wife so admirably reminded me.... \"Don't plan so much.  Be spontaneous.\"  I tried to tell her \"But they have such good reviews on yelp.\"    Alas, we got to Il Gatto Nero first, and I had wanted to try it anyways.  C'est la vie.  Little did she know it also has good reviews on yelp.  Muhaha.  I wouldn't have known what Il Gatto Nero actually meant, but there is a little picture on the sign sort of like the 'bat symbol' with a black cat on a yellow background for the linguistically challenged.  But hey....I know in french it's \"La chat noir!\"  What can I say?  I'm not completely hopeless.  We sat on the patio, which was very nice.  It wasn't overly busy, and we had our choice between tables in the sun or the shade.  It was fairly charming.   We both ordered pizza, as there were many to choose from.  She had one with mushrooms, salami, and hot peppers.  Mine was a more basic cheese, and basil.  We also had some red wine with it.  Their wine was pretty expensive I thought - nothing for less than $30 per bottle.  It always amazes me how restaurants sell a $12-15 bottle of wine for like $30-40 or more.  But as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay about double the cost of alcohol when drinking out.  So I suppose it's not that amazing.  I'm just cheap.   After I received my wine and begun to mull, I remarked that it almost felt like Paris.  Almost.... except for the huge hyper-market across the street and hundreds of cars whizzing down the street.  The pizza was absolutely smashing.  I'm not actually sure what was so great about it.  It was sort of an intangible.  But my guess would be the crust.  It possessed the same sweet smell of a good bakery early in the morning, when they've just made something delightful.  Plus the combination of toppings was great.  It all fit perfectly.  I would go back to Il Gatto Nero in a heartbeat.  But there are really so many great places along there to try.  We did make it to Kensington afterwards, slightly buzzed from the red wine.  It was wonderful.  I picked out two great dress shirts for like $8 each at a 2nd hand shop on Augusta.  Love Kensington.  Wish it was pedestrian-only though!  Why does anyone want to drive a car through there?  Will this city never learn?"}
{"text":"I have yet to try the food here...stopped by today for an espresso machiatto and service was good  and it was past lunch time. I like how ample the restaurant is and the side patio is cute. However, last year I sat on the patio, was given the menu but the waitress never came back to place the order so I left. I do plan on eventually trying their food."}
{"text":"A gem of a restaurant in the heart of Toronto's Little Italy. Food was good and averagely priced. I liked their variety of pizza's and they seem to have a nice selection of Italian and Niagara Ontario wines. Our waitress was pleasant (and very attractive) and checked in us regularly. Reminded me of the classical family run Italian restaurants you find in New York. I'm planning to go back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I live down the street from this place, and I've got to say- provided all the alternatives steps away from this restaurant, I'm not sure why anybody would choose Il gatto- be it for food or drinks. It's in the heart of Little Italy, and is way overpriced for mediocre food, and drinks. What's more, the female bartenders are very rude, and even scowl at you when you ask them what something costs- WTF?! You do realize your only job is to SERVE people right?! Also, the bar is frequented by older clientele so if you are young, head elsewhere. It's surprising because from the outside, the place looks  upscale, and even the interior is very nicely done. The ambiance is beautiful- it's just everything that matters sucks.  Neat fact: When I visited, I met this older dude, who is best friends with Charlie Munger's son. So, not a complete waste of a night :)"}
{"text":"Its been a while since I went to a place before checking the rating - we probably wouldn't have tried if I had done so. So I was surprised by the negative comments I read after finishing my meal here. We ordered pizza, salad and some beer, and I would say it was all good and no complaints. Service was good, no complaints. It was also great to enjoy the patio. Inside looks nice and quite intimate, although like I said we sat outside so I can't really judge.   Overall, seems like a solid place. The current average 3/5 rating seems on the low side."}
{"text":"Il Gato Nero Restaurant is located in the College and Grace area of Toronto's \"Little Italy\". Menu is simple: antipasto, pasta, pizza and daily specials. Food was average, nothing over the top.  The Eggplant Parmigiano antipasto was tasty. Spaghetti Alla Carbonara was creamy, pasta was overcooked............ not al dente the way it should have been. Spinelli (wrap) salsiccia lacked flavor, good portion size. I found the restaurant to be too dark for casual dinning Price point was average.  The service was good, restaurant was clean (big plus for me).  Would I go back............. not for dinner but for an espresso and desert!"}
{"text":"I had made an appointment for my brother's birthday and Mother's day for them to celebrate their day. Unfortunately I wasn't able to be there but from what my mom and brother were able to tell me was that the food was good but the service was horrible. They tried to flag the server down but they would disregard them or say they would be there but wouldn't come. I feel like they let them down because it was a special occasion and the fact that they felt that they weren't appreciated was a disappointment. I hope the restaurant takes this feedback and apply it so others don't have to go feel that way."}
{"text":"Co-worker and I came here for lunch.  Just had the Veal Panini which was a good portion for lunch.  Could have more sauce...but it was nice and tasty.    It came with a few olives on the side: Green olives were hard and needed some teeth grading action.  The black ones, soft and ok.  Waitress was nice.  Service was quick.  Not good with math but Panini was good :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Il Gatto Nero tonight for an early dinner. We were pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed our meals. He had the Pollo chicken wrap and I had the pesto pignoli fettuccine. The ambiance was great. My only recommendations would be for a bit more attention from the server, and perhaps a little bit more knowledge of the wines. Overall, great! I was surprised to come back and see the low reviews."}
{"text":"Just happened to pass by this place with my girlfriends and decided to try out this Italian restaurant, and it was a satisfying choice.  I had the fettuccine con pana with a glass of mimosa.  The crispy and savoury pana goes well with the creamy fettuccine. The mimosa was refreshing but the drink was quite small. The staff was super friendly and even offer to take photos for us. The food menu is only one page - some appetizers, salad, pasta, and pizza selections.  Slightly pricy, but the nice and clean decor, the helpfulness of the staff, and the quality of food match the price."}
{"text":"Came here for an espresso at night before going out. Didn't try the food.  The espresso was really good. This would be an ideal place to go for an evening coffee date if you order something espresso-based. I didn't try a latte though so I'm not sure how good they are at those, but for espresso and I'm assuming americano as well, they'd be a good spot.  The hot chocolate tastes like some no-name brand powder where you add water.  Based on the other reviews I WOULD NOT go for food here. It's never crossed my mind. Espresso is great though."}
{"text":"You know, I've gotta say I enjoyed this place. Cute little cozy spot to grab a bevvy or a decent pizza. I was there a few weeks ago with a friend who frequents this place quite often. We popped in to start our night on College Street and to grab a quick bite to eat and a tasty cocktail.  We scored a sweet spot by the window which was a quaint and cozy spot, and I think maybe the best in the house :) We both had a hankering for pizza, so we ordered the margherita with mushrooms as an add-on [the Ai Fungi pizza was a white pizza (without sauce)] and we both had a craving for a nice tomato-sauce pizza. Our server suggested that since the mushrooms were really saucy (they were marinated), that it would have been too wet with the tomato sauce and mushrooms which was why we opted for the margherita. I have to say the crust was very nicely done and the pizza itself was very tasty, and priced as a good pizza should be, at $10.50. Quite reasonable in my books.  Our server was also very nice and knowledgeable, so I would have to give Il Gatto Nero a positive on this one as well.   Great ambiance without being pretentious or overly done, and a busy spot for a Friday night out. I do recommend this spot, if even just for a drink and a quick appetizer to start out your evening."}
{"text":"This place strives to be a classy neighbourhood restaurant. Looks and atmosphere only get you so far. When it comes to quality of food, Il Gatto Nero lets you down. I'm not sure if the chef in the kitchen cares about the output, but what I got wasn't very impressive for the price you pay. Perhaps, the owner and the Chef might want to watch the movie \"Chef\" to understand the importance of true passion when it comes to the craft of cooking in a restaurant.  Bottom line, next time I'm in the neighbourhood, I have little incentive to come back to Il Gatto Nero for a nice meal, unless I just want to go for some drinks, in which case there are plenty of other venues with patios in the vicinity of 100m."}
{"text":"The facade of this place is a daily fixture in my life, but I first set foot in it very recently. The name always confounded me, for some reason, maybe because I just wasn't paying attention. Had I known it meant \"the black cat\", I would have maybe gone in sooner. What? I have a black cat, you know.  The inside is way more spacious than I always assumed. I went on a Friday, and it was pretty packed. I had no idea it was such a spot (as Anna V. mentioned). Anyway, the service was exceptionally friendly, and the food was delicious. My friend's goat cheese pizza had a remarkably tangy sauce and my gnocchi Gorgonzola was heavenly.   Great martinis, too. Not too vodka-y tasting and such a smooth mix of flavours. I'm not used to paying $10 or more for a drink (not since I went to New York), but they were so good (and I was feeling so indulgent) that I had two.   ...Oh yeah, and the cat silhouettes on each corner of the table made me swoon."}
{"text":"I came here last night for a friends birthday dinner and I was quite excited as I had read reviews on Yelp. The food didn't disappoint! I ordered the gnocchi which came in a creamy white sauce. I love Italian food and I would have to say the gnocchi tasted authentic and full of flavour. The pizzas looked really good too, I'll have to try it next time I'm there. The service was a bit slow however our server tried to accommodate us as best she could, plus she was pleasant and friendly."}
{"text":"Il Gatto Nero actually means black cat in Italian. Not Spanish. It is an Italian restaurant, after all.  Anyway, I went here once for a friend's birthday, and the place was jam-packed, they tried to squish us into a corner near the window, and we had the coldest wind attacking us for our entire meal.  And when I say \"entire meal\", I mean the hour and a half we spent mostly waiting for our food, or to get the waitress's attention. I get it, we looked young, we looked like maybe we weren't worth your time, but we still deserve the same treatment as all the greasy suits at the bar. Especially since I am generally a good tipper.  Besides the crap service, the food was OK. I mean, maybe I'd go back, if the place wasn't insanely crowded and I was desperate for food. The menu is just kind of boring to me, the food wasn't great and definitely not worth the effort of waiting in line for hours.  I feel like you can either make Italian food very specific to a region, or make it very basic and broad so it appeals to people who have no knowledge of real Italian food. This place is totally the latter. I hate to say it's Olive Garden-esque...but, it totally is."}
{"text":"Went here because they advertised that there was a special menu for those attending the Defending the Caveman show. I also stated that the menu was our interest for the evening on my reservation. We got there and were told that it was no longer offered even thought it was still on the website.   There were several other people there as well for the same reason who were let down with no apology from the staff or owner.   The food dissapointing. Got the rice balls and they were a bit dry and lacked seasoning. The pasta with meat sauce was pretty much something I could throw together for a quick easy dinner at home.   The deep fried calamari was pretty basic.   The only thing that I can compliment was the pizza sauce that was very fresh but limited toppings."}
