{"text":"After reading the reviews about Shanghai, I was excited to take my friend here for lunch. When we are in San Fran we go to funky hole in the wall places to eat and I wanted to return the favour. 

It started out fine, Ben Kingsley came in and sat at the other table. I'm NOT kidding. It seemed to confirm that I had made the right decision.  I ordered the fish & chips and my friend ordered the mac & cheese for lunch. 

After waiting for 60 mins to get our food (again, not kidding - Ben had to wait too) the fish and chips were greasy and tasteless while the Mac Cheese was missing the cheese (not kidding again) the garlic bread on the side appeared to be a a toasted burger bun. I wish I had taken a photo to share. :S

**I'm all for ironic food but at least make it somewhat good**"}
{"text":"im biased towards this place because I've had such fun times on the patio hungover with roomates. I usually get the all day brekky, everythings pretty standard except the potatoe hash somehow stands out (in a good way).

mostly comfort food, I really dig the atmosphere (tattoed waitresses, updated art walls, visible kitchen) prices are maybe a buck or two higher than they should be and the indoor booths really make you focus on your posture. patio is nice but Im a sucker for a view (it's enclosed).

go here with friends when you can't decide on a specific taste."}
{"text":"Burger was terrible. Wait staff for lunch was pretty new...

Fries were good though!"}
{"text":"I've been to Shanghai Cowgirl several times and live in the area. But after our experience last night, I'm afraid I won't ever go back. I was showing my sister some of the cool places in the neighbourhood and I thought that the Shanghai Cowgirl back patio would be a great place to get some food.

Halfway through our meal, however, my sister noticed a GIANT, DEAD insect in her salad. We are talking HUGE, complete with antennae, stripes and many, many legs. Our waitress literally jumped back from the table when she saw it. The worst part is, my sister is now fairly certain she actually ate another bug that was on her plate before noticing the GIANT, DEAD insect in the salad. 

It's not the waitress's fault. She offered us another salad (um, NO THANKS!) a few times until I actually had to ask if they would comp my sister's meal. She replied with an offer of dessert, to which we obviously said \"No thanks.\" I still can't believe that I actually had to come out and ask her to comp the meal!!!!

In summary, we got a free meal, but my sister had to eat a bug to get it.

The back patio also smelled vaguely of a backed-up sewer.

So no, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Attached to the Bovine is the Shanghai Cowgirl. It's the restaurant counterpart to The Bovine Sex Club and stays open mad late on weekends (till 4am).

They have a great back patio and the menu is simple and good. Sections like, \"Things Mom Used To Make\" include Chicken Fried Steak and Mashed Potatoes, but you can also get Shanghai Noodles, a decent burger and a triple-decker grilled cheese. They serve breakfast all day too. The dish they are most famous for are their sweet potato fries with a side of wasabi mayo. You have not LIVED until you ty this wasabi mayo.

They are open 7-days a week and like the Bovine, the staff are like a rock family.
You can sit at the bar or in booths, and there's always a local artist showing their paintings/photographs on their walls."}
{"text":"I tried the famous havarti grilled cheese with jalapeno spread and avocado, but it wasn't all that. However the ghetto chicken that arrived at the next table looked and smelled GREAT, so I'd suggest that without even tasting it haha. Wasn't really that busy on a weekday after work, which was disappointing. Decent little backyard patio and friendly servers though."}
{"text":"Oh Shanghai Cowgirl, how do I love thee?

I love diners. I love diners with good music. I love diners with beer and booths. 

Shanghai Cowgirl is all of these and more. 

The menu is a decent mix of comfort food, all day breakfast, sandwiches and classic diner fare. With a choice of fries or mixed greens for sides, I'm digging - and the side salad doesn't suck, which you might expect of diner greens.

The Vegan Delight Sandwich is quite tasty as is the Veggie Burger.

The Chicken Club is also really good, and the Perogi's? Bacon, Onion and Sour Cream...you had me at bacon, nom.nom.nom.

I've gone here a number of times and always had exceptional service - friendly and quick. I especially like not having to wait around on the weekend when you might normally have crazy line ups elsewhere for brunch.

With a back patio and artwork from Play Dead, Shanghai Cowgirl has a great relaxed rock 'n roll atmosphere. 

A visit to Shanghai Cowgirl is like putting on a pair of well loved and worn in Doc Marten's after a day pounding the pavement in heels. This comfortable gem is a great place to grab a bite and have a few relaxing pints and will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I must admit I'm a little biased when it comes to the Shanghai because I bartend next door, but I  loved this spot even before I started there.

I'm a vegetarian and there is no shortage of options for me on the menu which I love. My favourites have got to be the grilled cheese with tomato and garlic butter and the vegan delight sandwich (try adding havarti to it if you're not vegan - delish!) 

I also love the burger add-ons. Fried egg, avacado, mushrooms, oh my!

The ambiance is great - always good music playing especially at brunch on Sundays when DJ Vania spins - he's got to be one of the best DJ's in the city and I love his mix of classic rock, glam, and indie!!!"}
{"text":"Weird (not necessarily in a good way) salad dressing. My friend's food was incredibly salty, and I paid $4 to add chicken to my sandwich, which was a bit steep in my personal opinion."}
{"text":"Oh, I had such a good veggie burger here.  The place is kind of smoky from all the grilling/frying inside the restaurant, so I came out with my hair smelling like french fries, but I'm still full from lunch and so I'll forgive them for that.  The paper napkin that my cutlery was wrapped in was dirty, though, which I haven't gotten over--good thing I got something I could eat with my hands."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for beers and a casual dinner. I really love the grilled cheese - they have a few different options, but my favourite is havarti, avodcado and jalapeno! I've also had the vegan sandwich with avocado, hummus, sprouts and veggies - it's delicious. All the sandwiches come with soup, salad or crispy shoe string french fries (you can also half salad/half fries!). Other menu options are poutine, perogies, burgers (they have yves veggie burgers too), chili, asian noodle bowls, and all-day breakfast."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food, 4 for the great patio.

A fun venue for our Yelp Patio Night with a group of 8 or so people. The patio is in a secluded area in the back so you're away from the smog and human traffic, and beyond the reach of the aggressive panhandlers along Queen Street. (I somehow become a freak magnet in that area!)

They serve breakfast all day and plenty of vegetarian options with a focus on comfort foods like perogies and five kinds of grilled cheese. 

I usually avoid plain old chicken breast at restaurants (no flavor and always too dry!) but I was seduced by the cleverly titled, \"Trailer Trash Sushi\" ($9); a griddled chicken sandwich with arugula, tomato, and wasabi mayo. The chicken...uh...had no flavor and was too dry but the wasabi mayo made it edible. I should've had what Kat F. ordered; havarti grilled cheese with jalapeno spread and avocado. (Drat! Food envy strikes again!) And HEY, FRY COOK: Change the oil in the deep fat fryer. All our fries came out greasy and mostly burnt.

Still, the cheery waitstaff and good beers on tap won me over. We all had a fun time."}
{"text":"I only go there once a year for their NYE Pajama Brunch Party, it's a lot of fun! The food, you know, it's the greasy spoon type..."}
{"text":"Oh, Shanghai. Beer and a burger anyone? 

I order this weekly for my company and they have great service. If I could bold the word great there, I would. 

Their food is a tad expensive for the portions but the quality is worth it. I'd recommend their perogies. Load up on those and try not to nap."}
{"text":"What's your problem, grilled cheese? For a place called Shanghai Cowgirl, this place is just a humdrum, stodgy diner.

My main qualm with this diner is the grilled cheese sandwich, but its flaws speak to the larger problems: disorganization and laziness. Every time I go, I think, \"This time it's got to be better,\" but it just never is. I can't understand the three slices of bread in the grilled cheese -- it's just extra bread! I even asked for only two slices last time and the waitress bungled it. She then proceeded to ignore us to the point that we finished our meal, waited around, put on our coats, and had to go pay at the register. 

I've tried other things here as well -- perogies, soup, salads, whathaveyou -- and have never been impressed. For what you get, it's overpriced, and the service is really hit-and-miss, with more misses than hits. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I could put as much effort into this review as Shanghai Cowgirl puts into their food but then it would only be two words....Don't Bother.

However I feel you should be properly warned.

We arrived mid afternoon on a Saturday and the place was pretty dead. The DH & I ordered Eggs Florentine & Eggs Benedict, his with home fries & mine with sweet potato fries. The wait till served was acceptable however we would have waited longer for HOT food. Both types of fries were cooked...the day before...and not left in the 'toaster oven' long enough to be heated through. We were also not asked how we wanted our eggs (soft, med, etc). Had we been asked I'm pretty sure that we wouldn't have ordered one overdone and one underdone. English muffins should be toasted not raw. Nuff said.  

The only passible win was the hollandaise sauce, although I could only taste it not see it. Spread the love a little and add a decent spoonful please?  At the very least it would hide the fails that are these dishes.

Let's talk about service....

1) Smile sometimes - may work in your favour.
2) Know your menu and your soup of the day - don't guess AND tell us your guessing that todays soup is probably yesterdays soup.  


So for $37.50 (tax/tip included) I'd recommend drinking at 3am,  not eating at this place EVER."}
{"text":"Excellent patio at the back for summer lounging days - and the grilled cheese is good too."}
{"text":"awesome name for a restaurant. there is a patio. it was nice, but i have been to better patios. they could have used a few more umbrellas for shade. so we ended up sitting inside on a scorching day. 

staff was very friendly and nice. it was a relaxed atmosphere. the food was good, but we had to wait a while for it. a bit pricey for pretty simple menu items."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite places in toronto to have an informal meal.
Shanghai cowgirl is more of a diner, however I really like the decor (they have paintings/pictures by local artists on the wall) and they play great music. They also have a great back patio for the summer.
The service is always fantastic - the servers are very friendly and very attentive.
The food here is great and super cheap! Personally I am a big fan of the blue cheese and peameal bacon grilled cheese (though they also have a jalapeno havarti and avocado grilled cheese which is also good). One of those and a pint of amsterdamn blonde is my weekend breakfast of champions! Their fries, while super greasy (hey, it's diner food!), are fantastic! The chili is also one of my favourites, as are the pirogies.
All in all, I go here regularly, and so should you."}
{"text":"I am surprised that, for the most part, this restaurant receives glowing reviews.  The food is very much sub-par and - in certain instances (such as a sliver of pie with a scoop of freezer-burned icecream for EIGHT DOLLARS!) WILDLY overpriced.

On the plus side, the location, atmosphere and service are all great (if you like the open-kitchen diner thing which I do).

Unfortunately, the last time I ate here will be - literally - the last time I eat here.  I ordered the fried rice with BBQ pork at a whopping $14.  I received a small slick of impossibly greasy (deep?) fried rice with four one-inch pieces of cold gristly pork (at $1 per according to the add-on price).  Along with the aforementioned overpriced pie (which was a very clumsy concoction of 2-inch thich hard-to-chew crust and a few sour cherries) I felt really ripped off.

Had the price been at 50% I would have walked away satisfied with a greasy spoon lunch.  But, after a $3 cup of (Lipton) tea, tax and tip (I tipped 20%: the service was great)  I paid OVER $30 FOR A SMALL AND SUBSTANDARD GREASY LUNCH!

Totally unacceptable.

I hope the owner will read this, and despite the obviously wieldy overhead of his/her location rethink the menu prices some.  Or at least demand some kind of quality/quantity to match up with the exorbitant prices."}
{"text":"Being a comfort food junkie and loving the whole diner thing - I find \"Shanghai Cowgirl\" delivers both is spades. Everything from the tasty Jagermeister mousse to the classic rueben sandwich just seems to hit the spot with me.

The staff is cheerful and friendly, the room bright and airy and have I mentioned the backyard patio? The patio is one of my favorite summer haunts.

With a name like \"Shanghai Cowgirl\", how could one not just luv it?"}
{"text":"Had a few beer on the patio so this is not a reflection their food. 

I will say the menu did look expensive (9 bucks for egg fried rice....$3+ for chicken?). 

The art inside is right up my alley (slutty/gothic-rock). The bottled beer tasted like bottled beer. Patio was big enough, but I can imagine with a few smokers it may get gross. Give it a shot, I guess.

I'd give 3 pats, but... half the people in there sort of looked like degenerates. One dude looked like the love-child of Charles Manson/Rick Rubin after a stomach staple."}
{"text":"Made two separate attempts to talk to the management about the offensive nature of the \"Ghetto Chicken\" they regularly advertise on their sidewalk chalkboard....was rudely blown off by staff both times.
When I asked for a manager, on both occasions, I was asked \"Why\".  When I replied that I had a complaint, I was told that there was no manager present, and they refused to give me email or phone contact info for management.

They can keep their sign.....and I will keep my business for more enlightened venues."}
{"text":"Gooey After-bar Goodness:

I honestly don't have a tremendous recollection of my time at Shanghai Cowgirl - this was stop seven on a bit of a three-day tear through the city, and stop four that day after a rocking Creepshow performance at the Reverb (shouts to openers The Dreadnoughts and Hypnophonica) where I was well taken care of by my friend Mark \"Rockabilly\" L.

As far as I'm concerned, Shanghai Cowgirl and Lakeview are in the running for the best grilled cheese ever made.  It's rare that I'll rave so profusely about a meatless meal, but the jalapeno mayo, avocado and havarti grilled cheese absolutely blows my mind every time I indulge.  It's served on plain and delicious white bread and oozes cheese from bite one.  The rich, creamy avocado adds an extra level to an already delicious base.

Notwithstanding the hour (around 3AM) and the inebriation of most of the clientele (commensurate with the hour) the service at this place is consistently phenomenal.  Water was on the ready, service was friendly and food arrived quickly.  These guys have got it down!"}
{"text":"Despite its name, this place is a great little diner. Limited selection but what I had was pretty good.

Try the perogies--they're amazing, especially with a blond pale ale to go with them.

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Worst sandwich I have ever had. 
Its like they forgot to shop and so made up a sandwich by throwing salad between two crappy pieces of bread. And then a piece of chicken was walking along the way, saw this atrocity and fainted on it... That was my sandwich. Dead salad, dead chicken and bread thrown together. 

Thank God for alcohol!"}
{"text":"The best grilled cheese I've ever had: havarti, jalapeno and avocado with added bacon.  Admittedly not a complicated dish, but the sandwich was perfectly golden griddled and hit the spot for a hungover brunch to ring in the new year.  The accompanying fries were delicious and just what the doctor ordered:  thin with the skin in tact and a good ratio of mushy to crispy in their greasy glory.  $9+ is pricey for a grilled cheese but overall I thought the plate was worth it considering how good it was.  

Next time I would skip the $2 bacon addition - I was hoping for some crispy style bacon for added crunch but it was disappointingly of a floppy and very fatty variety not to my taste.

The place was busy but service was good in refilling my iced water.  The one drawback was that they started blasting the music toward the end of our meal - it was about 2pm and the place suddenly turned into a stereophonic club.  Loud and nauseating (or was that the hangover?)

Overall, can't wait to get that grilled cheese again..."}
{"text":"i'm a regular at shanghai cowgirl and the last few times the food was horrible.  I always get the shanghai noodles and they usually give you a good portion, enough for two people to share.  I literally got 2 little mouth full of noodles, and on top of that the noodles was drowning in sauce. That was my first experience but i let that slide because the waiteress was amazing... until i went again with a group of ppl..and again same situation, this time literally 20 strands of noodles, and in stead the cold chicken was not cooked with the noodles it was thrown on top of the warm dish.  When talked to the waitress she had attitude and said  the wok was broken so they had to cook on stove...how does that make any sense..don't you cook your food on the stove anyways?? when we complained and said we had very few noodles and cold chicken..she said\" like i said our wok is broken, that's why we gave you extra hot sauce\" so how does that make sense again?? Then she goes about and talks about us to another waiteress which was very rude.  Then she comes back and again not that polite says she will take off the the price of the chicken which was 4 bucks..that was decent of her, but in the end the waitress and overall experience just made it horrible and i would never go there again. I've already given it 2 chances.  I don't know if its the waitress or maybe they changed their cook? But it use to be good not anymore..it sucks!"}
{"text":"Looks like Michelle A. beat me to the punch in this review, but I'd have to agree with her! It's a great spot for a casual drink, all day breaky or anything else on this pretty varied menu. They have everything from shanghai noodles to poutine to perogies to veggie sandwiches. Michelle A. also says they have a great grilled cheese sandwich.

They have only a few beers on tap, a pretty good choice of bottled beer and a basic bar stock. It doesn't really have a bar feel to it, but it was nice to catch up here after work with some friends. 

The service was good, very friendly and they gave us separate bills with no issue.  It was also very quick! The booths are pretty tight (not much room), but the space is small in general. And I think the food was a little expensive even though it's good. Most dishes, even the all day breaky range around $9 although they did offer side dishes in the $4 range."}
{"text":"Classic. Just classic. I'm from the west coast of the States and this place would fit in nicely alongside many of our old hangouts in Seattle or LA. Love it!"}
{"text":"Sort of 2 1/2 stars, because I'd probably go back if I had no where else to go. 

Sat in the back patio at lunch, place was empty except for another couple.  Service was efficient and she didn't mess anything up, but there was something unruly about her appearance, although I'm sure that's part of the charm of the place.  I had the bagel with cream cheese and lox; the fries it came with were good but I was disappointed they smeared the bagel with just a thin layer of cream cheese.  I like when it comes with the big scoop on the side.  Each half just had one slice of lox as well.

Coffee wasn't terrible.  Not much else to say."}
{"text":"Generally, not a fan.

I find that Shanghai Cowgirl is a place for hipsters to go and chow down on nostalgic comfort food like Grilled Cheese. The grilled cheese here tasted like it was made with Kraft Singles. Maybe this is just hipster nostalgia/irony and I am missing the joke.

Every time I've eaten here, I've never found the food to be anything special. The service has always seemed to be aloof and disinterested in anything but their next audition.

Am I being a massive bitch here? I just don't really dig this place. I know a lot of people do, and that's cool. I find there's nothing new on their menu and the comfort foods they do are not much compared to some of the other places around town. Nothing seems fresh and inspired and I understand that diner food isn't necessarily supposed to be, but Between the greasy sandwiches, perogies, burgers, all day brekky and the three noodle dishes available, I'm thinking that I may be better off cook at home. It seems like all flash and no substance.

Just not for me."}
{"text":"so I came her once again this time in summer and of course to the patio!
the patio is big and can accommodate big groups. 

the food is good but I find the portions are too small. my shanghai noodles were ok but too much  ginger and not enough spicy for version - hot. 
the prices are ok and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Alright, who's ready to get their raunchy on?!  Wait, what?  What'd you mean?  Its NOT a strip club?  Oh shucks!

With a name like Shanghai Cowgirl - I can only think of how successful this would be if it were transplanted to an expat neighbourhood in Shanghai as a gentleman's club.  Alas, there were no sexy ladies here.  Only servers with plenty of tats, and a lot of \"interesting\" characters that dined here.  Almost as interesting as the plastering of bumper-sticker-like propaganda - Saigon hookers and dildos?  Those belong more in a Hangover movie than it does at a diner.  Or maybe I'm just not the right target audience for such \"artistic\" displays.  Speaking of art, you will find a wall of it for sale.  Its very emo-goth if you ask me - but hey if it floats your boat...

I came armed with a Team Buy voucher.  I had heard that this was one of the go-to places to get some decent food if you're a night owl as they are open ridiculously late.  

The booths will make any girl insecure about her size - damn are they narrow.  If you are claustrophobic than this probably isn't the place to go.  On the flip side, if you're a klutz, most of your spillage won't end up on your lap because there's but a wee crack of space between your upper body and the actual table.  

The menu is typical of a diner - fries, burgers with some fusion items thrown in there like noodle bowls, fried rice.  

I ordered the Ghetto Chicken - mostly because I was weirdly drawn to the name of the dish.  It was a disappointment.  KFC, which costs significantly less does up chicken better than this place.  The batter was a brown that was too-dark to belong on a piece of fried chicken, and blander than hospital food.  The actual chicken itself had no taste either.  It came served on a bed of (burnt) carrots, asparagus and mashed potatoes.  Sadly, the best part of the dish were the mashed potatoes, and even they needed a sprinkling of salt.

William T. got a burger with blue cheese and mushrooms.  The blue cheese added a nice creaminess to the burger but the mushrooms were virtually unnoticeable.  The sweet potato fries were depressing to look at, as they were limp and not very crispy.  

The only memorable part of the night (other than the activist male patron who sat behind us butchering his poor female dining companion about his left-wing ideas) were the Pierogies.  We got ours with char siu pork, ginger, scallions and chili pepper flakes.  It was topped with a dollop of sour cream.  I must say the sour cream is a nice touch, as they smoothed over an otherwise starchy and rather grainy pierogi wrapper.  The inside was filled with potato and cheese.  I thought the bit of sweetness from the char siu marinade and the spicy chili pepper flakes were great flavour enhancers.

Verdict:

For 3 food items and 2 drinks from the bar, our bill came up to about $62.  That's a little steep for a diner.  At about $10 for a base burger and then $1-$2 for extra toppings, a burger can set you back $15.  I think that for a diner, their price point is a little off - but then again I'm sure rent in this neighbourhood isn't cheap.  

For food that your dad can grill up on a BBQ or that your European grandmother can make, I'd say eat at home instead of dishing out at Shanghai Cowgirl.  However, since I don't have a European grandmother - I'd probably come back here - but only for the pierogies."}
{"text":"Killer decor - funky ambiance.

Subpar food - go to Loblaws and buy frozen perogies, defrost and fry them in oil.  What you make will probably taste better than what they serve here.

Also, Asian noodles in soup made by non-Asian young bloods when Chinatown is a 10 minute walk away?...yea...I don't think so...

The food is terrible here.  All show; no go, I'm afraid.  Typical downtown fluff.

Server was very nice though."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Grilled cheese with havarti, jalapeño and avocado on rye was tasty, but expensive for what it was.  Fries were a bit over cooked.  Should have gone for the half-salad/half-fries side (nice that they provide the option).

Staff was attentive but food was slow despite the place being nearly empty during Friday lunch."}
{"text":"I think Sunday was just one of those days I should not have been dining out. So brunch on Queen West with a friend...Shanghai Cowgirl was close by and we hoped quick!

We took a seat on the patio and waited to order our drinks and food, service was slow...but they were quite busy. I ordered the eggs and peameal bacon with salad, my friend ordered a chicken salad. 

My food was ok, the scrambled eggs were a bit, well for lack of being able to describe them I will say \"meh\". My friends salad was disappointing, iceberg is making a comeback...who knew! The salad was small with hardly any chicken, at $13-14 it was a sad affair salad. Kind of reminded me of one of my Mum's 1980's salads...I kept waiting her to put her head out the door saying she forgot to add the prawn cocktail. 

Once we had finished, the girl cleared the table but never brought the bill. After waiting 15 minutes we went inside to pay and proceeded to stand at the bar being ignored by the server. We seriously could of dined and dashed had we been that way inclined, luckily we are honest gals so we waited patiently to pay. Would I go back...I don't think so!"}
{"text":"I went here for all-day breakfast this past Sunday. I was quite surprised by this place. It has a great (and unexpected patio) in the back complete with booth seating and other free floating tables. It was a great place to catch some sun while mowing down our overly delicious food. 

I'm not sure if this is a regular part of the menu, but if its not it should be. Egg's Benedict with smoked salmon. The only way to describe it was as absolutely kick-ass. I'm definitely looking to have it again. Hopefully that doesn't inspire them to jack up the price. It was a great meal at $11.25.

Go eat it!"}
{"text":"It's been years since I've been here, and for some reason I remember it being better than this.

pros:
-tasty milkshakes
-an enjoyable hamburger
-a decent back patio
-open late

cons:
-the house salad is the worst house salad I've experienced in some time (what was I thinking not ordering fries anyways?)
-$2 for cheddar cheese or bacon on a hamburger seems a bit steep when for the same price I can get a piece of peameal bacon (so yeah, it was a $14.50 hamburger after adding both cheese and peameal)

I'll probably give this place another go sometime, but won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"This may be the carbs talking, but Shanghai Cowgirl, you is one fine broad. Your front may be unassuming, but I like your back -- your back patio, that is. So much space for me to roll up into, kick back, and enjoy myself. You know what I'm talkin' about. Yeah, that's right, baby. 

You know what I like. What, you're going to make me say it? Ok, fine. I'll say it: I like your pierogis. They're so hot. Nicely filled, with a tender dough. You went a little overboard on the sour cream, but that's okay, I forgive you -- we've all gotten a little too excited from time to time. While I'm at it, I gotta say -- you've got a cute little poutine, you know that? I'll admit, I've had better poutine before. But yours, Cowgirl (I can call you Cowgirl, can't I?)...  it ain't half bad. Good savory gravy on top of perfectly crispy fries, accompanied by a goodly helping of cheese curds. Don't be shy with those cheese curds, babe. Just sayin'. 

Oh, Shanghai Cowgirl. I like your style, and you serviced me quite well. I'm very satisfied. Can I call you for a second date?"}
{"text":"Like one of the earlier reviewers mentioned, this place is all about comfort food, but they reinvent it in new and interesting ways, so that your order of grill cheese (in my case, peameal bacon and blue cheese) is in no way boring and more than likely delicious. Most of the items on the menu piqued my interest and I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Came here with three friends, one of whom was vegan, to enjoy a quiet Sunday night dinner.  The place was quiet, and the server friendly.  I tried the ghetto chicken, which I had with the house red (served in a regular glass, unfortunately).  It was alright, but not as tasty as I was hoping.  My meal, including tax and tip, came to $30 (a bit pricey for what it was).  My friend couldn't complete her liver & onions dish (which I tried and thought was pretty good), but my other friends devoured their chilli and their vegan sandwich.  Overall, a nice kitschy type place with its own charm and a nice patio in the back."}
{"text":"Stumbled over here on a mission from Wrongbar a few summers ago. The crowd was more than acceptably hilarious when we arrived at 3:30am--which, at 3:30am, is kind of a real draw.

People were still drinking. Good times were had. The atmosphere is contrived dive, and the price reflects that: $12 for perogies ain't cheap. Then again, these aren't just any perogies. In fact, they were the most delicious perogies I have ever had in my life (attribute that to the state I was in if you will, it's still a fact): ginger, garlic and pork. Drool. I remember them years later, that should say something.

I'd recommend hitting the SG during an hour of the night, and in a state of mind, when  you're willing to spend anything on comfort food; with this disposition, it will come in above expectations."}
{"text":"Today for lunch I ordered the red pepper corn chowder.. There was NO corn in this chowder, only garbanzo beans.. AND it was meh
Ordered the Mediterranean salad - seriously? why soo much dressing.. 

I dont like this place!"}
{"text":"Found myself in area with some time to kill and was hungry so gave this place a try...heard about it and walked by it but had never been in.  Diner style with booths and stainless steel counter and stools, classic diner updated.  Given the omnipresence of tv screens in bars/restaurants these days was surprised i didn't see any.  Menu was usual comfort food items.  I had the Mac n Cheese. Service was ok, food good.  The Mac n Cheese was tasty and steaming hot, came with garlic toast on the side.

I would come back here again, food and ambience (west Queen west hipster vibe, music was indie rock courtesy Sirius XM) was good, just what I needed on a cold night."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite place to go in the city.
It's set up like an old diner and the food is as such with big burgers, all day breakfast, sandwiches. They also have some not expected food like rice and noodle dishes. Amazing Jagermeister mousse. Their vegetarian options are decent.
They have a big booth in the front for large cozy groups and booths and tables throughout the restaurant.
They have one of the best back patios in the city. You can't hear the busy street out front while you are back there. I have spent many long night drinking coffee with friends back their.
It is a hidden gem and you will find a lot of bands from the neighbouring clubs eating there.
The art and waitstaff are super cool."}
{"text":"After a stroll on West Queen West, fellow yelper, Jason C., and I ended up here on their gorgeous back patio to grab some grub.

Perogies! They say the perogies are delicious. So hence why I got them! I was also craving poutine that day, so obviously, ended up with with the perogies with gravy and cheese curds. Perogies were deliiiiish.  However, I wasn't blown away by the gravy or the cheese curds.

Awesome time to spend the night. Patio's gorgeous. Décor inside is uber cute."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a late dinner when we passed by this place. The menu had stuff we'd eat listed so we figured we'd give it a shot.

My wife had the sliders w/ sweet potato fries and I ordered the chicken fried steak & eggs breakfast. Three 3 oz sliders = 50% more than the basic burger for about the same price plus they're char broiled and tasty if you like your meat cooked by flames.

The chicken fried steak was a tough cut of meat tenderized w/ a mallet, then breaded and fried. Basically, it's the definition of chicken fried steak. Served w/ mash, gravy and 3 eggs over easy, it was a hearty late night dinner and would be a pretty hearty breakfast. The only caveat was the steak tasted off. I didn't feel sick or anything, but it was slightly tart.

Loud, dated and decently priced, we'll add it to the list of late night go-tos."}
{"text":"Shanghai Cowgirl's delicious comfort food rarely disappoint me. 

I've eaten here dozens of times and have noshed on almost every single item on the menu (I'll admit that I haven't tried the Liver and Onions but I'm gonna). 

My recommendations are the perogies, grilled cheese sandwiches, hamburgers and sweet potato fries. But a great reason to visit Shanghai Cowgirl is the fact that they serve KLB Raspberry Beer. 

This brewed elixir is heavenly and I'm so happy that they have here on tap! Just another reason why this food joint is on my list of top restos in the city."}
{"text":"I headed over to Shanghai Cowgirl for lunch for the first time in years, my previous experience being pleasant but hazy (most likely due to their modest beer prices).  

We each had a cheeseburger, which was pretty good albeit a bit greasy.  But at a joint like this that exudes the greasy-spoon vibe, I suppose it's to be expected. What I was disappointed in was the side salad; it looked like the kind of garden salad you get from a food truck or grocery store pre-made.  My fellow diner indicated the fries were equally uninspiring.

However, the service was great - really friendly and prompt.  Also, it's pretty hard to go wrong on their back patio - quiet but lively, even at lunch hour. I'd imagine that Cowgirl is particularly good for drinks and I've heard good things about other items on the menu. Looking forward to my next visit!

Cheers."}
{"text":"I came here on my birthday with the intention of having my meal here and then staying for drinks afterward. However, I ended up just eating my meal here and going someplace else for drinks because the drinks here were very expensive! The food, however, was moderately priced.

I ordered the Ghetto Chicken (mostly for its name) for $15.95. My friends enjoyed my meal but I didn't really love it. I would rather order chicken from  Swiss Chalet... My friends ordered Philly cheese sandwich and none of them enjoyed it. All three of them said it was too salty. Another friend of mine ordered the perogies and she really enjoyed it.

As well, since I came with a big group of people, the waiter knew it was somebody's birthday and gave me a free dessert (ice cream sundae). It was delicious! (but you can't really screw up ice cream)

Even though I didn't love my meal, the service was good and I think I would like the other things off their menu."}
{"text":"This old school diner has a too cool for school kind of attitude that makes me a little uncomfortable.  That said, the place is really cool; it's open late (4 am on weekends!), the food is greasy-spoon great, and the space is comfortable (booths and bar seats) and fun.

What more can I say?

Try the fries."}
{"text":"Came here late one night after a nearby establishment was too crowded for our liking...

We all got Reubens, and were excited about it because Reubens are delicious. I'm not sure how you could screw up the delicious combo of corned beef, sauerkraut, swiss cheese, and thousand island dressing on rye, but you can! Sadly, the Reuben at Shanghai Cowgirl had mayonnaise instead of thousand island dressing. The Reuben was missing that tang, which helps cut through the richness of the cheese and the meat. The sandwich seemed a little on the greasy side as well. Definitely had better Reubens in my day.

The booths were also really tiny, and the four of us really had to squeeze in. The server was very friendly, which was probably the bright spot of the evening. I would say it would be a good place for a casual milkshake, and maybe a snack of grilled cheese, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"There are some unexpected surprises for patrons expecting Queen West attitude/grime here. For starters, the patio here rocks your brunch when the sun is out and the weather is warm. This place seemed pretty clean and the service was exceptionally good, especially considering I was part of a group of eight and we decided to bask in the best of both worlds with our sides of half salad/half fries. 

I'm not a fan of breakfast food but it seems like anyone who orders it here leaves satisfied, and it looks pretty tasty too. I ordered the Trailer Trash sushi (next time I'd probably try the grilled cheese), and while it didn't blow me away (I thought it would be more spicy), it still satisfied. The fries are tasty and made me regret my decision to include salad. Should have gone all the way with the fries...I would not go out of my way to eat here again but I'd return for the patio."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday with a group of 20+  on the back patio for my birthday and the service was amazing. They did separate bills (using our names!) and the whole thing was flawless.  I have been to other restaurants with fewer people and the whole thing gets messed up or its crazy chaos when it comes time to pay, but this was perfect!!!  

The food is casual, but there is something for everyone....vegan (salads and rice stir fries), veg or meat eater. The side salads are good if you want to substitute out those fries."}
{"text":"Sometimes I have french fries with George Strombolopolous. This is one of those times. 

VIBE 
The best funkafied diner there is in the city. No fuss, no muss. Lovely tiling on the floors and comfy booths without the paper and crayons on the table. 
We were there later so not many people were there but usually it's your usual Queen St. West crowd - tattoos, musicians, and people who look hipster but aren't. 
George is lovely and a Torontonian legend (as well as famous). It's fun to see reactions to someone who is well known. I seriously wonder how many times he must get mooned on a regular basis. 

I EAT 
It's really about the food. The perogies here are the perfect comfort food on a cold winter's night. As is their grilled cheese sandwich.  Dining companions got the rice as well and it was delish. Not ideal for those on a weight watchers diet. The portions here are massive as is with their fries in a bowl. Greasy, salty and everything you want after midnight. Delish. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
It's not Shanghai. It's not a cowgirl. But it's quirky and fun and so Queen St. West of old. Me likey."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years. 

Revisited last night + was completely happy with everything. The only thing I noticed was that the property is a bit tired looking - they could use a fresh coat of paint, some repairs to the drywall and maybe clean up/polish some of the furniture/fixtures.

The food was great, service was super friendly, music & vibe were good.

Our bill for 2 mains & sodas came to $37 (before tip) which I find pleasantly reasonable. A comparable meal at the nearby Thompson Diner would have been well over $60 with bitchy/indifferent servers.

I'll definitely be re-instating this spot as a staple of life in Toronto."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this joint at a Yelp event last week.  Although the skies looked ominous, the downpour held out until I was safety home. 

The good:
My Ghetto Chicken Sushi was good.  My sweet potato fries were better.  The Wasabi mayo was the best.

The bad: The pie was weak.  It took awhile for the waitress to notice I existed.

The weird-and-amazing:  Zack and I stayed late to do some more drinking, and I asked the waitress for two surprise beers.  She came out with them behind her back and made us flip a coin over who got which hand.  And it was awesome.  A Tsing Tao and a Kingfisher.  Loved this part.

Overall:
Success.  I wouldn't rush back here again for the food, but I would definitely go back for the company and patio.  Even though the emergency exit is right below the gas line, which made me uncomfortable in case of fire."}
{"text":"My friend described this place perfectly:  The kind of place someone from out of town, who really hasn't tried the best  of what the city has to offer, would love. 

Which is to say:  It's fine.  Not bad, not great, just solid mediocrity.  

The food was fine, but nothing to write home about.  Spicy noodles weren't as spicy as I would've liked but otherwise tasty enough, and the service was fine, but I had to ask for water three times, which is a definite no-no in my book. 

Overall, I don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a staple to the Queen St  West restaurant scene.  The decor of Shanghai Cowgirl is very diner-esque, and all the waitresses resemble 50's pinups with all their tattoos.  I have eaten here twice, the first time i had a philly cheese steak and it was quite good.  The second time i went with a large group of friends and they all ordered breakfast and none were too happy with what they got.  The sausages were really greasy, and the french toast was hardly soaked in eggs and very dry.  I had the lox which was your standard however it was over 10 dollars which i find really expensive for a bagel, cream cheese and smoked salmon.  However i really love the vibe of this place and will definetely go back."}
{"text":"It was my first time out on the Shanghai Cowgirl back patio, but I have a feeling the mosquitos had been waiting a long time for my arrival. It was like they'd starved themselves all day long just for a taste of my blood. I hope I'm not sounding pretentious, but just ask the bugs, I'm tasty. Anyway, this feast on me is no fault of the restaurant's at all, but it definitely didn't make my meal pleasant.

A couple of things that made the Queen West institution only a-okay for me and mes amis on this particular late night visit: 1. The server bursting the bubble that Shanghai Stout is anything special. \"It's actually just made by [a local brewery] and rebranded as our own.\" She could've put a different spin on the drink that I had just ordered, but maybe it's just me. 2. Anticipation over the much hyped ghetto chicken was met with an \"Oh, we're all out of that\". However, my initially disappointed friend who went with the suggested alternative of chicken fried steak was left quite satisfied. 3. The mussels in wine broth were seriously puny.

The dining room has always been great when there are people abuzz. I should probably not complain while the patio is open and the weather is decent enough for us to sit outside though. I'll just have to suck it up."}
{"text":"Went for a quick drink after work. The place and the area remind me of Greenwich village in the New York city. It's like a place from the \"Friends\"  episodes. Will certainly go back for a drink and may give a shot at their food. 

P.s. the lady who took care of me gave awesome service. I think her name was Laura, not sure, will ask next time.

All in all cool and awesome

{"text":"Giddyup.

At the recommendation of a girlfriend for some quick and easy food we stopped in at Shanghai Cowgirl.  The entire walk down Queen Street she just kept going on and on and on about how good the food was, the ridiculously labeled menu options,  how nice the staff were, how much I was going to love it, blah, blah, blah... 

It seemed decent enough at a glance when we first sat down.  Then the waitress with the rockin' personality came over.  Then the menu made me laugh.  I order the Trailer Trash Sushi (a grilled chicken sandwich with wasabi mayo) and a glass of wine.  

The wine was very generously served in a regular tumbler as opposed to a wine glass.  Had I been anywhere else I would have frowned and probably found myself picking bits of cork out of it, but at this place it seemed appropriate (plus there was nothing floating in my glass).  My chikin' sammie was delicious.

And in that moment I knew what happiness was. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So just go already."}
{"text":"Awesome patio.  Cool vibe.  Decent food (ordered the burger and the trailer-park sushi - both were good - not amazing).  However, the Jagermeister mousse was to die for!  Wasabi mayo and sweet potato fries were also good!   But the mousse!  Wow."}
{"text":"At one time, one of the hippest spots in one of Toronto's hippest neighbourhoods, Shanghai Cowgril prefigured a number of trends; asian fusion, comfort food, diner classics, chicks with tattoos, ridiculously late opening hours. 

Today, like the Queen Street West strip it inhabits, Shanghai cowgirl is more shabby by than shabby chic. The servers' sass is just grating, and the food is indifferently served to patrons in frayed, nearly two-dimensional narrow booths. 

Service is markedly disinterested. The right orders arrive, and you're actually impressed. If you order alcohol, you're worth more effort. 

Coffee is typical diner brew; more hot and wet than anything. Add some Kahlua and Baileys and it's a pretty solid B-52.  Breakfast sees watery eggs and underfilled sausages sided with griddled, chalky potatoes. 

If grilled cheese is your thing, then Shanghai Cowgirl is your huckleberry. 

Multiple variations arrive on triple-decker challah; all golden buttery goodness. A version with avocado, havarti and jalapeno alternates creamy and spicy to good effect. It's sided with pale but crispy frites. 

Caesar salad is just slightly wet, but it's salad dressing packs anchovy punch and an obscene amount of balsamic-drizzled croutons. It may not be diet food, but it's a tasty option. 

A promised roasted red pepper soup is too sweet, and would do with less sugar. 

The club sandwich is almost perfect; a fresh-grilled Portuguese pada bun, lightly glazed with something sweet; a properly-grilled chicken breast, mayo, crispy bacon burnt to hell, and decently fresh lettuce and tomato make a perfectly good dinner, until a mouthful of gristle at the end threatens to upend the works onto the table. 


If Shanghai Cowgirl were one of it's hipster clientele, it would be that dude with the receding hairline and too much chunky silver jewellery. You know, the dude who leers while counting backwards to see if the girl nursing wine coolers meets the half-plus seven rule; and who stays well past the end of the music. 

I don't care how good the grilled cheese is. Sometimes you just gotta grow up."}
{"text":"Had my birthday lunch here.

Completely agree with Susan C's review - I booked here mainly because a) they take reservations for large groups, and b) they have a kick-ass patio.

The food, on the other hand, was pretty average. I had the Eggs Florentine (brunch special), my friends tried out burgers, the veggie sandwiches and some of the trailer-trash sushi sandwiches. 

Everything looked and tasted OK but I don't think I'd return there to eat. 

I would, however, definitely return for a sunny day on the patio with some drinks. Awesome patio and cool decor.

Oh - and the service was A+ !  Waitress was great, did up separate bills for all of us, didn't muck up the orders and came back regularly to top off water, etc."}
{"text":"We were hungry! We want Food!! After a Yelp Elite Event in the area, my yelp date kept saying she was hungry... which happened quite often, so a bunch of us decided to go for a late bite at Shanghai Cowgirl. 

Too bad it was kind of chilly at night so we opt not to sit in the patio. Services here were excellent! Our waitress was really attentive and even willing to give us separate bills!! Since after a few drinks, no one would able to figure out how much their meal cost!! 

I shared a triple decked grilled cheese sandwich with harvati, jalapeno and avocado ($10.95) with Steph L... since she loves avocado and I love jalapeno so we both happy with our selection, or was it her selection?? The sandwich though on the small side but it was perfect for a late night snack. 

Shanghai Cowgirl is a cute diner if you want some comfort food. Nothing outstanding but at least you know you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good home food, the patio is good - brunch is good if you can get a seat in the summer all the power to you.

I like the more home style food myself - meatloaf I havent tried but was told was good. Did try the souther fried steak and was news worthy in itself with mashed potatoes and gravy..meh.. you really can so much fuck that puppy up too bad..

The servers rocked and the atmophere was laid back and the food was what it was. The prices where good."}
{"text":"Good comfort food, very good service as mentioned in previous reviews.  Definitely good for groups.

Made reservations for a party of 13 on Sunday at 8:30pm.

Pluses
+ When we got there the table was set up at the front with multiple jugs of water and menus which was great.
+ Everyone liked the food - burgers, chili, lentil soup.  I agree that the dip for the fries was really good (wasabi mayo?)
+ Servers were cool.
+ Nice atmosphere / decor... place was a bit empty but considering when we went, it makes sense... would have been nice if it was a bit more lively
+ Nice to see fairly large, clean washrooms.
 
Cons
- Like some other reviewers mentioned, prices are slightly steep but nothing too ridiculous...  and as mentioned the food is definitely good.
- No real appetizer section on the menu, so we got the fries and onion rings as appetizers."}
{"text":"I have been going to shanghai's for 3-4 years. I use to always order the chicken club and beers. For one, it was the best price and it was also tastey. They have had 2 major price hikes in the past 2 years. When the club went up 1$ it was still fairly reasonable. I think that its a popilar sandwich due to its price, and lack of options on the menue - so they jacked the price up because they sell so many. The last time I was there within a week between visits, the price went up 3 whole dollars. I cant justify paying so much for a sandwich on queen west when there are plenty of other delicious places with more selection. I might return for beer on the patio - but as far as dinner or lunch, I can't do it.
It has a great atmosphere, and friendly people...."}
{"text":"Hard to believe I haven't yet reviewed Shanghai Cowgirl - when you're craving comfort food (which I always seem to be, even though I could easily make it myself. What, my stove hasn't been turned on in months!) this is the place to go. They have an entire menu section called \"Things Mom Used To Make\" that includes liver and onions, ghetto chicken, chili, perogies and the like.

I had a monstrously delicious grilled cheese, but before I describe it I have a confession to make: when I order grilled cheese, I prefer it to be on regular white bread. No weird seedy breads with nuts and husks in them and please no Texas Toast. I want to be able to fit the f**ker in my mouth, thank you. 

So when I saw the words \"triple decker\" I feared for my life, but mercifully Shanghai Cowgirl uses good ol' white bread and my sandwich was more than manageable. Which was ideal, cause I tried to stuff the whole damn thing in my mouth at once. Spicy havarti, jalapeno mayo spread and avocado. Can it get any better?? No. (Well yes, it could have if the fries had been anything but forgettable. But that's another story) At $8.95 it was a little spendy but so, so worth it

You wouldn't know it by the main diner's decor, but there's a beautiful and secluded back patio with lovely wooden benches and more than enough room for large groups. And the sweethearts even take reservations!"}
{"text":"My friends came here for a birthday celebration. We were intrigued by the \"rock and roll diner\" concept, so we decided to check it out. 

I ordered the triple decker grilled cheese with harvati, jalapeño and avocado. I'd read positive reviews on their grilled cheese, but I felt that it was overrated. Firstly, the sandwich itself is on the small side. I got some nice heat from the jalapeño but I wanted more cheese and a little less avocado (and I am an avocado lover). The side of sweet potato fries were also on the disappointing side. Perhaps I personally prefer a thicker cut fries, but these were kind of sad and limp. It also didn't seem very fresh to me.

The perogi with bacon and onions, on the other hand, was excellent. Absolutely drenched in sour cream and so unbelievably delicious! I would come back just for them.

My friend's ghetto chicken was also a delight! Very tasty crispy chicken with gravy and mashed potatoes....yum... I want to go back and eat some more of this too!

3 of my friends got the philly cheese, which was an utter disappointment. It was too salty and otherwise unremarkable. My friend even had to use some ketchup to mask out the saltiness."}
{"text":"About 2.75-3 stars for me.  It was ok.

Came here for a good friend's bday (coincidentally, she's a fellow Yelper).
Us 20 ate out on the patio.  Food didn't take too long to arrive considering there was a group of us.  We only had the one server, who was mostly good at getting water for us all.  She managed to get all orders right by noting our names down, good idea.

*vegan options were limited;
*$9.50~ was too pricey for a hummus sandwich plus side, imo.
*if you want gluten-free options, you might be ok w/ a salad of theirs (doublecheck their dressing, tho, which didn't taste too amazing);
*ate in the back patio - had enough space for us all to sit, however there was a chain smoker or two seated nearby puff daddying the evening moments' away...

I'd go again if another friend held a party here, but not sure if I'd feel inclined to eat here on my own given that Gandhi's rotis are just a few doors down (closer to Bathurst)."}
{"text":"The workers here seem to be quite friendly. The selection is primarily pub food with a Shanghai twist. They have these Shanghai noodles that were pretty delicious, although my friend had the burger which was also decent. I am not really sure what to say about this place, I guess I was hoping for a better selection of Asian food. On the contrary, it is devoid of Asian food, except for the Shanghai. I guess you can't go wrong when the food you are eating is included in the name of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Overall, a good experience. I hadn't been there in the summer before, so I was pleasantly surprised by their giant and well kept back patio.

I had the perogies (yeah, i know I spelled that wrong) with feta and mushrooms and my friend had the Steak Sandwich. Apparently the sandwich was really salty... but he ate it all. So, I can't really speak to that.

I had a caesar and it was too spicy and I love spice. But again, overall it was drinkable.

I guess it was a very enjoyable experience due to atmosphere and hilarious hipster watching and sunshine, and the food was good, it just had a few little hiccups. 

NOTE: If you're ordering the perogies, ask for the sour cream on the side. They slather it on top of the bowl, so it's hard to take them home in a doggy bag. They're rich... so you'll want a doggy bag."}
