{"text":"I first checked out this place in June, I had a terrible experience.  Our server was rude and it was obvious she did not want to be there.   The place was not that busy.  We ordered chicken wings and beer.  Not a difficult order right?    We sat there for what seemed like an eternity, our drinks empty and no sign of the server to come and refill.   We walked up to the bar to try to get another drink while we sat and waited for our food.     During this time I had lots of time to admire the decorating of the interior, which was actually nicely done but to my surprise was not busy for a Friday night.   Now I know why....

Another couple of tables filled up close to us, they ordered and we watched as they got their food (chicken wings as well I might add) finished their food, paid their bill and left.    2 tables came in after us, ate, and left before we had even got our food.    As they were paying their bill I went to find the manager to complain and we were ready to leave.  He encouraged us to just wait a minute and he would take care of it.   The middle aged blonde server then came out from the back with a big fake smile as she grit her teeth with a big loud fake apology that the kitchen was backed up.   Really?  Nice excuse.    Our food finally came moments later, delivered by the manager.  The wings were not fully cooked.  It was awful.

About a month later in July I returned, not by my choice but with a friend who i tried to discourage from eating at this horrible place.    I quickly looked around to make sure we didn't end up with the same horrible server as last time, which thankfully we didn't.     My experience was a bit better this time, the server was pleasant and the wings were cooked this time and I didn't have to walk up to the bar to look for ice for my drink.    

Still first impressions count.   I gave 2 starts only because my 2nd experience was better than the first and the server deserves some recognition for my 2nd time around, but if I had my choice I wouldn't return based on my 1st experience."}
{"text":"Service is slow and drink isn't goods. They got my martini wrong.
Food isn't the best either. Don't expect too much from this place. Food portion is small but it's what you pay for."}
{"text":"So we got the ribs and wings which wwre amazing. The wings tasted fresh...iI have no other way of explaining it but they definitely tasted different in terms of freshness than your regular wings. 

Caesar salad was also quite good. My ribs were AMAZING. So well prepared and not oger sauced. Fall off rhe bone and very delicious. Would highly recommend this place. I hope they are consistent with the quality and prices"}
{"text":"Went for leafs home opener. Vibe was cool and the TV screens kick butt. Food was great and price was amazing! Service wasn't the best but the girl was new, so I'll give her a break. Draught of Heineken was cold, wings were hot and tasty, t-bone was cooked perfect and apple crumble was solid. Hope the service gets better because this is the most solid franchise food I ever tasted, no food service package stuff here. Thanks Chuck's."}
{"text":"Too bad their menu doesn't show the new \"service charge\"of 3% which they say is on food and drinks.Unfortunately they apply the charge to your meal after tax,so it's actually more than 3%.
I can see the servers will probably lose out on tips also."}
{"text":"I was really impressed considering this place just opened a couple of days ago. I came here with really low expectations. The prices are so cheap and the North Whitby location has horrible reviews, so I didn't think it would be that great. Thankfully I was wrong! 

If you come here expediting 5 star food, you're in the wrong place. If you want decent eats for a reasonable price, this is it!. 

I ordered the rib and wing combo which at $15 and change is one of the most expensive items on the menu. You get a half rack, 4 wings and fries. The wings had a nice amount of breading on them. I wish there were more sauce options though. The ribs fell off the bone and had a nice tasting BBQ sauce. Fries were decent. 

My husband had the t-bone steak. It was cooked rare just like he asked for. It had nice flavour, but it was tough in spots. Still a good deal for $13 and change. 

They also have amazing specials (like half price wings after 9 pm daily) and alcohol is cheap. 

The service was good, but the food was a little slow. I'm going to give them some slack on this until they have been open for more than a couple of days."}
{"text":"Was not at all impressed with this restaurant.  My husband and I were seated quickly and our waitress came to offer us drinks straight away - no complaints there.  
My husband ordered the calamari starter, I had the bruschetta, both arrived within a reasonable time and we enjoyed them BUT we were only half way through eating them when our main course arrived!!
I have never been to a restaurant where I have not been able to finish my appetizer before being rushed onto the next plate!
I therefore left the remaining slices of bruschetta to eat my steak.  I have no complaints about the food but it was nothing special, the best was the bruschetta which I loved but didn't finish.
Our waitress was attentive and the atmosphere wasn't bad (if a little echoey).
Over all we felt it was mediocre and will not be going back"}
{"text":"Went for supper one night hamburger was brunt and that night went home and got sick never will go back."}
{"text":"Since my review of this restaurant I have been contacted by their social media group who will be sharing my concerns with the local management team.  I am impressed by the fast response and sincerely hope that the experience I encountered was an isolated instance. I will post another update on my return."}
{"text":"Excellent Prices, Service is quick and to the point. Take advantage of their specials for best value. Burgers are definitely good and fairly priced. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Really long wait for dinner. Almost an hour for Chicken ribs and a steak with fries well done. 
Should have taken a picture. The fries were not well done and 4 wings and the smallest baby back ribs certainly not a $20.00 plate . Steak was good certainly not a 1 lb steak and I traded fries for an up charge for soup. So I got what I ordered steak on a plate and a hot bowl of french onion soup. The bowl was hot the soup not . 
One spoonful was enough french onion soup should not be sour that's a sign of been sitting around too long. 
Nope not eating that..
When I suggested the soup was not good the waitress gave me a huff and cleared our plates. Really ....we were still eating the fries. 
Frustrated we asked for the check and waited for another 15mins.
Still left a tip but was less than thrilled with the experience. 
As for the 3% food charges it translates to the menu looking less expensive but the final bill is higher. 
We will try it again let's hope the burgers are better."}
{"text":"2nd time only at this location, once at the North one at Taunton. My first time here, as I recall was not a stellar experience. Just after it opened, I remember it being loud, and slow, and a few menu items being unavailable. 
Today's experience redeemed it somewhat. First let me say, it's still loud. They need some kind of sound dampening in there. The volume peaked at 91 decibels...yes, I measured! 
Anyway, upon arriving, we were told there was a 10 minute wait, not excessive, but I was a little miffed at seeing 3 open tables. We were seated at one of them after about 5 minutes. As we were being seated, we were told the kitchen was running behind, so service would be slow. We debated leaving , but decided to stick it out. Ordered apps with our drinks, then our meals as the drinks arrived. At this point, my son started to not feel so well. The apps arrived pretty quickly, but it soon became clear that we weren't going to make it through the meal, so asked for the entrees to go. They accommodated us graciously, checked up on our son, and I'm pretty sure they pushed our meals up, because we didn't wait long. The food was still hot when we got home, the steaks were cooked perfectly, and very tasty. For a budget steakhouse, both the service and food today was excellent. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The service is ok but the meat was warm even when the chef did it twice the second was also warm and the reason that the manager gave is because I ask for my meat medium rare is not on the grill enough time to heat. The estrange thing is that the lobster tail and the butter for the lobster was also warm. I think the chef needs and the manager needs more training. They shouldn't charge for the plate but is ok. No way we return to this place again."}
{"text":"I was definitely disappointed with Chucks Roadhouse! And will not be recommending this restaurant to anyone. I had ordered a rib eye steak medium rare. But what I got was a very well done steak. No pink at all. When telling the waitress this...which she said it was her fisrt day, she had apologized.  Waitress was very nice. The only thing Chucks Roadhouse wanted to do was give me a free dessert ..... ok so at least it was something.  But I have a nut allergy....which I had told the waitress before hand cuz I needed to find out what was in a dish. Also, after eating starters and the fries from my dinner and some drinks..who wants to eat dessert. They should have said that they would comp a starter...not give me something that I cant eat anyways. I do have to say that the starters, caeser salad and loaded fries were really tasty."}
{"text":"Good food at ridiculously cheap prices. I'm not sure how they are able to sustain but we come here often. We like the quesadillas, all you can eat garden salad and chuckaroo for dessert."}
{"text":"Food was good, glad to see the place was busy but not happy with the start. Waited 15 minutes no one acknowledged us so I had to call over the manager. Luckily Nicki saved the day. She was a great server. She changed the experience so we will be back"}
{"text":"-1 's

pardon the word vomit

we arrived at around 9pm and was seated almost immediately but then waited for a solid 10 mins before we were acknowledge by a server. The server then said you'll be helped by the bartender which was fine we were right next to the bar. The bartender comes over and slams the menus down and asks what would we like to drink? Didn't even get a chance to glance at the menu. 
We get our drink orders and food orders in and wait. He comes back with and slams dishes on the table along with our drinks. So from the start he was pretty rude. Didn't check-in until the end. Asked us if we would like our bill and we say yes. Can we please have separate bills? So the bartender says really? You're going to do this to me now? I couldn't help but say I can't tell if you're joking or not. He leaves and comes back with the debit machine and my sister who's been a server for x amount of years couldn't help but ask if he was serious about this comment. He replied with I was just trying to save time. At this point we were extremely annoyed cause he was being so rude. He said he's been busy all night and hasn't stopped since we came in so I guess he decided to take it out on us? I was just trying to save time. 

Thanks for the awesome experience..."}
{"text":"This is the first Mississauga location, we had heard good things and decided to give it a try. We went on a saturday around 8pm and it was not very crowded. The first thing I noticed was the restaurant still smelled like fresh paint...I'm hoping that as the weather gets better they air it out. Dining room booths are really close to the bar so you can see the tv's and hear conversations of patrons at the bar. The menu was fairly straight forward with the usual fare and nothing special in their apps. For our mains we had the steak and lobster which came with fries and corn ($20) and the two patty burger which came with fries ($11). The food tasted really good. It exceed our expectations for the prices. I was pleasantly surprised about the burger in specific- it was excellent! I asked for chipotle mayo, or something comparable and they didn't have any (everything on the menu is pretty standard) For desert we had the apple crumble ($6) and it was pretty good. The service was fast and friendly. Looking forward to trying other items. Although we didn't  drink, we noticed prices for martinis and beer were pretty low. The downsides were the smell of paint, and that they only have 2 items on their desert menu...and nothing with chocolate! Overall we would definitely come here again, service was fast, food was tasty and inexpensive."}
{"text":"We went as a family around 530 on a Friday - surprised how busy it was!  Honestly going in we didn't really have high expectations, but the kids wanted to try it.  We were all pleasantly surprised by the food.  Between us, we had calamari, burgers and steak and it all exceeded expectations, in particular the steak. 

The bad?  Service was far too slow...started off okay but took too long to get our main courses and once those were delivered our server seemed to disappear. It's never a good sign when you stack up your own plates and are searching for somebody so you can pay for your meal!

We'd come back for the food (4/5) but the overall service experience needs improvement (2/5).  Hope you guys figure it out!"}
{"text":"I sit within  the wall of Chuck's and can see potential.. lots of potential... however the food has a far way to go.  Our small group of two made an order of calamari to be followed with a 10 Oz peppercorn steak with Fries for my wife and I chose something a bit lighter with a steak salad.  First let's start off with the calamari.  If you wanted want to call Costo freshly frozen calamari that was deep fried then seemingly hastily thrown onto some tomato based sauce restaurant quality we may have a difference of opinion.  I was hungry and didn't care that it tasted like prechewed 5 cent bubble gum from when I was a kid.  But moving along.  The main event... my steak salad first... the steak wasn't half bad.. cooked to order (medium) and delicately sliced and plated on a salad bonanza... however after looking closely, I realized that this salad was seemingly the exact composition of the prepackaged salad I can by at Sobey's.... coincidence... possibly.... my wife on the other hand had a very different experience.  Her 10 ounce peppercorn steak which was ordered as medium well was essentially still mooing at her during the first cut and oozing juices.  That and also the peppercorn sauce that was advertised was actually HP sauce with random peppercorns.  We eventually had to flag down a waitress to have them refire the steak, where they asked my wife to place her steak on a separate plate rather then take the entire plate away to correct the issue.  Upon return, the steak was correct however the waitress promptly removed the remaining plate and food from my wife to replace it with the steak alone... no sides...  at this point I think we both had our fill.  Chuck's has an OK atmosphere and staff are definately trying but the food has a lot to be desired when there are so many other options on the other side of the highway."}
{"text":"First time visiting. Burger and fries under $7.00. Domestic pints before 5:00 at $4.00. Decent service, great prices and a nice, new clean environment. I would give 5 stars but the 3% Honest to Goodness fee on the bill rubs me the wrong way. Just raise the prices 3%. They would still be great prices."}
{"text":"Went here a couple times with family and friends. The prices are fantastic and the quality of the food makes it worth it. Not many options for sides, but that's the point, less options keep costs down. It says right on the menu they only add 3%.

The burgers are alright, possibly frozen, but the toppings are great! Crisp bacon and sauteed onions make my day! Fries are pretty good too. I haven't had a steak there yet, but my family said it's pretty good.

My second visit, I got the quesadilla. It was super greasy. It was crispy tho, BBQ chicken inside was awesome, lots of cheese and stuff, but you definitely need extra napkins!

Service is always good. Everyone is pleasant. Place is clean and tables are cleared quickly. I'll probably be back!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my buddies and noticed the prices have all gone up by at least a buck for the food. At least the 30 oz beers were still 5 and a bargain to boot. For the extra dollar the burger was still a fair deal and my friends enjoyed there lunch. Service with a smile as usual."}
{"text":"This place is a perfect example of you get what you pay for. 

Came with coworkers after work, 3 of them got the 20$ steak and lobster 

I got the 20$ 1 pound steak. 

I asked for medium rare & I got it well done, I wanted to complain but I knew by the time I got a new one I'd be stuck eating alone. 

everyone's else food was ok but nothing special and the waitress was brutaaaaaal

She was expressionless and slow. 

Worth it for the price, just super disappointing about my steak"}
{"text":"The staff here are amazing!! We were seated by Terrance and served by Danielle and we had a fantastic time. Danielle was so friendly, she felt like part of our group. She joked with us and we all had a great time together. Although I don't eat meat, my friends had the wings and said \"These are the best wings I've ever had\". I had the cheese fries which were delicious but I wouldn't recommend them for one person as they're very dense. We had the spinach dip as an appetizer which was good but way too small in my opinion! The dish is very shallow so there isn't much dip but it tastes great!
All in all it was the staff that made our experience here the best. Although it's out of my way and not typically the kind of place I go, I'd return just for the service alone."}
{"text":"Gets the steak right 50% of the time. I hope it's a kink they're working out because the prices are great."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food and location! Staff was friendly and welcoming. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Tried this out and was disappointed. Hostess that greeted us was very friendly and seated us immediately. Had to wait 10 minutes for a server. Ordered a couple of drinks and an appetizer. The appetizer, calamari, was served raw. Had to go find a server to tell them. Server was not overly helpful. Instead of possibly offering a free appetizer, suggested we try something else. Declined and asked for the bill. Bill arrived and included the untouched raw calamari. After finally having the raw calamari removed from the bill, paid for our two drinks and left. Too bad. In the era of social media, restaurants like this one could have turned a negative experience into a positive one through a good customer experience. We will stick to the Erin Mills Pump."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing !!!!!  super super kind management. Super nice people who work there. Food is super cheap and super delicious! They charge u 3% ontop so they can keep low prices ! I for sure would come back. Amazing great quality food.- ALSO SUPER GREAT HALF PRICE WINGS AFTER 9 EVERY NIGHT!"}
{"text":"Food is great, make sure to take advantage of their after 9pm wing special discount! Steak is pretty affordable too, and is good for its price, you wont be dissappointed. They also have a good selection of appetizers and starters."}
{"text":"You get a decent sized sirloin steak and a small lobster tail with a piece of corn on the cob and fries for $20.00. You can't beat the price. If ordering an entree you are offered a bottomless bowl of very fresh salad for another $4.00. Wow! Great deal. Service is usually decent but noise level sometimes does not allow for great conversation. Lots of parking at this location and usually there is not much of a wait if any to get a table."}
{"text":"Ordered the T-Bone steak and was happy with the food and the service, but the 3% 'Honest to Goodness Fee' that they add to your bill really bothered me.  Chuck's Roadhouse adds this fee to everyone's bill without disclosing it to its customers beforehand.  It is a hidden tax that they are trying to slip by unaware customers.  When I asked my server about the added 'Honest to Goodness Fee' added to my bill, she couldn't answer any questions I had and referred me to a written statement on their drink menu.

The 'Honest to Goodness Fee' is so that Chuck's Roadhouse doesn't have to raise its prices.  But why not just raise your prices by 3% and not add this hidden fee? This is done so that when they have to raise their prices, they will just increase the 'Honest to Goodness Fee' percentage trying to hide the increase from the customer.  This is not transparent and deceptive.

Is Chuck's Roadhouse charging HST on this fee?  Why not just offer $1 steak and lobster and increase the 'Honest to Goodness Fee' to 2000% and avoid paying HST to the government?

Before you order sit down and order at Chuck's Roadhouse ask your server to explain the 'Honest to Goodness Fee' and why it is necessary and if it is mandatory?"}
{"text":"Good Quality Steakhouse with reasonable prices
I ordered the T Bone which for $16 Canadian seems very cheap. I was actually worried about what quality you get for that price!

Steak was cooked to order and tasty.Well worth the price! All the Toronto Sports teams were on the HD Monitors and service was friendly and professional. I would Definitely go back and recommend it to friends.
Waitress was friendly and professional.

Came back second time and ordered a Bloody Mary that was good for $4.
Fun Fact! In Canada, they call a \"Bloody Mary a \"Caesar\"
I read some of the other reviews about slow service.
Part of the issue after talking to the waitress is there an No Busboys or Hostess!

The Nice ladies I saw worked hard.

Hope to go back soon on my next trip!"}
{"text":"We recieved coupons in the mail and thought we would give the restaurant a try.

We were expecting a typical pub style restaurant, which it was. 

We visted on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and the restaurant wasn't extremely busy (at least not in the dining area, but bar area was full of mostly men). 

The service was so-so (sort of slow and another table for served before us, even though we were seated and arrived well before the other group). Anyways, the server was very friendly and kind- had a great smile. There was only one server for the entire dining area.

The prices for the food were very reasonable (cost less than competing Pubs) and portions were not bad.

I ordered a burger, which was actually quite tasty, warm and not dry! (Which was a bonus as I find when I order burgers usually they come burnt or dry). My fries were luke warm.

My family ordered chicken fingers/fries which were piping hot and a chicken sandwich meal, which was actually not good (cold- as it was sitting for a while, not much taste and seemed small as there weren't a lot of ingredients on the burger).

Anyways, would we visit again? 
- Yes, to give it another try. 

Would it be our top pick out of other pub?
- Probably not, but once in a while visit would be alright if we were in the area, but wouldn't drive specifically to the restaurant

Lastly, the decor is nothing special. Didn't do much renovations from previous restaurant (Crabby Joe's). The booths were very worn out (pleather was coming off) and washroom was OK (one of women's stall was missing the lock on the door, so you couldn't even use it.)"}
{"text":"We stopped here tonight just prior to picking up our daughter in Brampton.  We have never been to this chain before.

It's unfortunate because based on tonight's experience we will not be back.

We had a goat cheese dip that looked like it was poured out of a jar.  I've had chicken noodle soup broth that was thicker.  The bread was toasted but had obviously been there for a week or more.

The ribeye steak?  About 2 mm thick and cold.  

Service?  We had no cutlery and no plates and no napkins through the appetizer.

See photo re the condition of the steak.

It is very inexpensive to eat here and the price reflects the quality and preparation of the food."}
{"text":"Service is very good and the price is the most attractive. Food is average but the Caesar salad is very good. We start to love this place."}
{"text":"We went to Chuck's on June 28/18.  

We used the coupon for buy one, get one.  We got our drinks (pop) quickly and the waitress was very pleasant.  We ordered the Smokey Mountain burger and fries.  The best burger we have had in a long time!  Fries good, food hot, and burger was just a big red but tasted amazing.  After reading the reviews we checked our big and low and behold there was the Honest to Goodness fee.  It was only .47 cents but this should to mentioned at the time the person sits down so they can make the decision as to whether they stay or not.  We would go again."}
{"text":"Came in at 6pm about a week ago for dinner for two. Hostess sat us down... waited 18mins for a waitress to get our drink order or at least say hello... nothing. Watched as two other tables were seated and saw the waitresses go and take there order. Ask if the hostess if they even knew we were seated? Meanwhile it was clear to all the waitress where we were as we were right near the back where they were all standing talking. Only thing I can say is when we were served the waitress was nice and friendly. The food was okay at best. I would recommend going else where then coming here... sad that crabby joes was replaced by this place."}
{"text":"ordered steak and salad.. steak was ok.. salad was disappointing..  3% addon to final bill...  disappointing...  service was ok..  meh.."}
{"text":"Had the sirloin medium rare with lobster tail and it was excellent.  I am always hesitant to order sirloin when out however it was cooked perfectly with excellent char. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place just opened last week, saw it on Facebook.  The picture on the ad was steak and lobster that looked amazing so it enticed us to come try this place.  Came for Valentine's day dinner.   We ordered the 1lb ribeye with lobster tail for $29.99 that came with corn and fries that tasted great and cooked well. We also ordered the 14oz New York steak with loaded baked potato. Steak was cooked well and tasty but the loaded baked potato needs to be more loaded.  Wine prices were not bad. $9 for a 9oz.  Nikita the server was very nice and provided great service.  Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Best way to describe this place is a very low end Montana's, and the goal of this place is 'cheap'.

As soon as you walk in you can see that the decor is trying to be a roadhouse, but on a very low budget.  The look is a cross between a roadhouse and a cafeteria.  Service was not good.  Girl at the door seemed lost, and the guy serving our table gave us the impression that he was in a hurry, didn't really have time for us, or cared.

Now to the menu... not bad in terms of options and the pricing is very cheap.  We had two drinks, two meals and an appetizer for $40.  They also have cheap $4 beers so that's cool.  The food itself was barely average, very cookie cutter mentality.  I get the impression that nothing in this place is prepared on site, all frozen and off the shelf ingredients.  I had the Big Chuck burger.  Again not bad, but not great either.  It's just a burger, with what tasted like store-bought frozen patties.  Fries were horrible.  They were just regular fries but they tasted like they were freezer burned.  Very rare that you get bad fries from anywhere.

In the end it was a less then average experience.  From what I can guess, this place is designed to get a night crowd in to drink, watch sports and have low quality food, all on a low budget.  I can see a place like this doing well in an office building mall where people just need some place to eat for lunch, and on the cheap.  Might be ok for GM employees who work near by.

But for me, I'd rather go to Burger King which is right next door."}
{"text":"They have a \"service charge\" of 3% which sucks for the servers because they lost out on some extra tip $...the fries were terrible and food was just mediocre. I would rather starve than have to eat there again."}
{"text":"Words can't describe how bad our night here was.

First of all, my steak came out looking exactly the same as the picture for the establishment -- but with the added bonus of having a broken bone with shards scattered through it.

After we order our food and are seated they casually come back to tell us the draught system isn't working up to their standards and will only serve bottled beer instead.  But lucky for us, it's only $6 per bottle!  Fantastic!

\"All steaks served with Chuck's World Famous Fries!\" 

Well let me end the suspense -- the only thing these Fries are world famous for is sucking huge balls.  Chuck must be the worlds biggest asshole because they are absolutely 100% frozen and served unseasoned, glistening with oil

Pretty much the first time I have EVER left less than 15% on a bill.  I think I was STILL too generous

Walked to Maguires on foot as fast as we could get out of there, and have nothing bad left to say about the rest of the night."}
{"text":"Horrible service !!!!! Even worst food !! Ya the prices are cheap but the managers have horrible customer service skills . We got cut off after having 2 doubles and a crap load of  food ... every drink took half hour to come , and waited 45 mins for our bill after we got cut off . My medium rare steak came out blue rare !!! Bunch of morons working here. Bring back crabby Joe's please ."}
{"text":"Just walked out of there, will never go again! Stood for over 15 minutes, no greeting, had to wave to the server (who was cozy sitting in a booth) to give us a table. Waited another 20 minutes in our table, and no one ever came up or acknowledged our existence. We walked out, and no one ever even noticed. Can't comment on the food because we never even got our drink order taken. The waitresses were cleaning tables and keeping everyone at the bar supplied. The sad thing is we went when it first opened, had drinks and dessert and it seemed promising, good service and good dessert. We were going prepared to drop a big bill, and they lost out."}
{"text":"Don't expect speed and great service here. It is painfully slow and all the waitress/servers here seem to be working at their very first job and not knowing what they are doing. However, the food is not bad at all and the price is the reason why you will come back. Their fish and chip, steak and funnel cake are pretty good. They also have cheap drinks/beer/caesars. Worth the try if you're no in a rush."}
{"text":"Poorest service,  mediocre food with amazing prices.  The kind of place you'd visit the day before pay day.  Still for what you pay,  good food and atmosphere"}

Nothing special....just some sauce thrown on some ribs along with frozen fries....yuck.  try making some REAL fries.  They would be a winner!"}
{"text":"Half price app's after 9pm! Can't go wrong. The vibe is a bit odd but.. wings for $5 how can you complain!"}
{"text":"Chuck's Roadhouse replaced what used to be Crabby Joes in Brampton. We came in on what I believe was the opening day, so you could still smell the fresh paint, which is understandable. After arriving our waitress told us that it was her first table ever and you could definitely tell. She couldn't seem to stay away from the table for more than 2 minutes at a time which got really annoying after a while. She was very nice, and I'm sure she will learn in the future. To start off we got a couple of pints from there not so big selection of draft (Canadian or coors light) although there was no selection the price was just right. You can't say no to a $6 32oz beer. After getting the beer we proceeded to order a couple appetizers (garlic bread, and spinach and goat cheese dip) the price seems excellent, however you quickly find out the quality and quantity of the food matches the price (7 pieces of pita with the 3 tablespoons of spinach dip) after the appetizers we went on to the main course (chicken fingers, philly burger, and smokey bacon turkey wrap) once again I found that the quality of the food matches the price you pay. You could tell that the food was from a box, and that it was only re-heated in the restaurant. Overall the prices are good, the service friendly (maybe a bit too friendly) however the food was not very good. If you're thinking of going to McDonald's I would suggest  coming here though because it's roughly the same price and you can have a beer with your meal. (our bill was $70 and we had 2 32oz beers, 2 20oz beers, garlic bread, spinach and goat cheese dip, chicken fingers, Philly burger, and the smokey bacon turkey wrap)"}

Food wasn't up from the party yet so we decided to order from the menu. Mine was the Mushroom/Swiss burger with Chucks World Famous Fries. Don't know what was \"famous\" about them. They were just frozen fries with zero spices. Not that great at all. The burger itself was actually very tasty! They said it was six ounces but it looked a little small. My wife had the Plank Salmon & she said it was delicious. 

With the party came the undercooked wings...I mean really undercooked. They were essentially barely cooked with zero taste. We were a big party so twice we had to go up & grab our drinks. The place was pretty good in price but that won't make up for the other failings. Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Ordered a burger and fries and was just horrible 
Everything is frozen food 
Even the fires were not tasty

I barely touched my plate and the waitress still charged me 

My husband ordered wings and that was also tasteless 
From the outside this place looks decent but the food is extremely low quality"}
{"text":"$20 for a 7oz Surf and Turf and it was cooked well!  Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I had an early lunch today at Chuck's Roadhouse Bar and Grill.  This is a chain (I've never heard of them until today) and apparently they have been open in this location since February.

I sat in a booth on the dining room side.

I ordered a bacon cheese burger (I swapped the American cheese for mozzarella cheese) and fries.  I ordered gravy on the side.  It was a good solid burger and I liked it.  The fries were good too.  I'd get this again.

I felt like something sweet so ordered The Denver \"Hot Apple\" for dessert.  It was definitely sweet and was just what I needed.  I'd get this again too.

Shreya was my server.  She was friendly and took good care of me.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm upping my 3 star to a 4 on this update for Chuck's.

To be honest, you cannot find a better place (with unbeatable prices!) for beer drinking in Aurora. If you are a beer lover, this is the place for you. My uncle loves Chuck's, and he comes here religiously almost everyday - you might spot us sharing a pitcher of Belgium Moon on Fridays lol. 

20 oz. domestic beer for $4 from 11am to 5pm everyday. 54 oz. domestic pitcher for $9 on Thursdays. Lunch specials are only $7 - I really enjoy the Crispy Chicken Wrap, it comes with a side of fries or you can change it to corn on cob with no extra cost. The delicious Prime Rib Burger with fries for $5 on the menu is also quite a steal :D!

Service is always friendly and welcoming :) Food does take a bit longer to make but I'm sure a pitcher of beer can keep you company lol."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place hasn't gotten a review yet. Starting off with the prices are literally unbeatable !! Chucks roadhouse adds a 3% to the food so it evens out the food cost. They're slogan is that the customers come for the food and amazing price. Well god be damned this place has got me hooked with the prices and the food. The steaks flavouring is honestly amazing. The service is also fast! I love the pub feel of this place. 

Everyday wings are half price after 9 pm if you purchase any beverage which I think is really worth it. This restaurant honestly gives you your bang for the buck."}
{"text":"The nachos were dry, some burnt and  not enough cheese or toppings. Will not recommend"}
{"text":"I totally agree with some of the other reviews here, good quality food at a uber cheap price.  With the bogo free entree coupon we received in the mail, the Asian in me is screaming scorrrrreeee!

The Mr. started with a 32oz beer for
$6.50 followed by a 10oz New York steak and lobster tail $25.99 while I ordered the lobster tail dinner $23.99.  I have to say, these were very decent size lobsters and it tasted very fresh.  The Mr. also like his steak very much. To finish off the meal, we got the baked apple with almonds crumbs and ice cream.  That's was just ok, not the best I've had. 

The service was very good and efficient. We will definitely be back with or without the bogo coupons!"}
{"text":"First time I went there.. Loved the food prices and drink prices

Recent visit.. Had to wait 20 mins for a drink.. Wings were like boiled..
Fries were definitely stale.

Cheap food prices.. You definitely get what you pay for.."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner as we were felling like steak and our son felling for lobster. The prices are pretty good but the lobster tails pretty small. The steaks were good and cooked just right. We'd go back for the steaks and skip the lobster"}
{"text":"I really don't know how I feel about this place. Every time I come here its a different experience - literally a hit and miss. 

My first visit with my boyfriend was great. Servers were great and food was great too! Chuck's Road House made such a good impression on us we recommended it to our friends. My friends, boyfriend and I decided to come back another time and grab some quick food before we headed to a party. This time was one of the worst experiences - especially since we got such a rude ass server. Seriously. Perfect example of why I don't believe every server deserves a tip... Even when handling payment she was giving attitude - like really? Don't know what it is with the person who hires for this restaurant but 5 out of the 7 times I've been here we had a rude server. Anyway, pretty embarrassing to recommend and speak so highly of a place to your friends only for it to end up being a shit-show when you bring your friends because of the service. 

Food during the second visit with my friends was ok - fries were very stale though. 

Also, every time I come here we've never been seated right away. It is quite a wait, and a few times we had to wave a worker down so someone can seat us... which is ridiculous, really.

The only reason why I keep coming back here is because my boyfriend loves steak and prices here are amazing! Steak is very good and affordable - my favourite is the peppercorn steak."}
{"text":"My date wanted to go out for drinks and chose this place. It was pretty new and I like the atmosphere. We only came here for drinks so there's not much to say about the food. 

Their service was on point, they kept checking up on us which was nice and didn't interrupt us. It wasn't that loud and a decent place to grab drinks. They don't have much variety in drinks but it is a sports bar and that is what is expected."}
{"text":"0 stars if possible. 

1. Service: met the waitress 3x. First is drink order (that we had to remind her to bring), 2nd when food came, 3rd when we had to chase her down for bill. There were maybe only 5 tables at the restaurant only too....

2. Food: burger was dried like jerky and patty was more thin then a McDonalds hamburger. No taste. Mozza cheese was so thin it was see through.... Mozza....Wings were real bad and frozen food taste. 

Worst: chased her down for bill she gave me the visa machine then just walks away and never sees her again. 


Never ever go back. Rather eat PB N J."}
{"text":"A previous reviewer commented on the fries. Can honestly say that Chucks Roadhouse is consistent! Not sure what it is, the fries were good right from the kitchen, but after about 5 minutes of getting my order, the fries went downhill fast! 

I ordered the clubhouse, and have never had one so dry before! The menu stated \"with mayo..\" in reference to what was on the sandwich, but received two little packages of mayo on the side to put on myself.

The triple decker as they call it, comes on thick Texas toast. Apparently they don't even bother to butter the bread here, so it made for a VERY dry sandwich, even with the mayo on it. 

It's the \"Home of real food\" so my fault for asking of the turkey was real turkey meat, or the pressed luncheon meat. Turns out it is the pressed luncheon meat. 

All is not lost tho! The gravy is good, so are the beef ribs! The goat cheese spinach dip was awesome! There was more dip than garlic flat bread, but it was awesome! 

The service was good at the very beginning, and they did ask how the meal was two bites in, but never came back until about 10 minutes after I was done eating. 

Hit and miss if I'd eat here again...I let them take my plate with fries on it, cause even with the gravy, I just couldn't eat them. 

I have cooked in a restaurant for a few years, and also waited on tables as well. Chucks Roadhouse could definitely use some improvements! 

Decent prices tho! Mind you, with that being said, look at the bottom of your bills when you get them...they charge 3% on your bill \"to keep prices low\"! They don't tell you u less you ask about it."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to checking out this establishment because it just opened and had good prices. I joined my group who was already there and sat at the table for 10 minutes without a server asking if I wanted anything to drink. I had to stand up and asked the bartender and another server where our server is. The manager said she'll be with me soon. 

Eventually she came out to take my order, I ordered the Striploin + Lobster tail, medium rare. As I was waiting, she was handing out cutlery to other people at my table who ordered before me, yet failed to give me a set knowing that I will need it to eat my meal. I waited 30 minutes and finally asked the server where my food was. She went to check and said they had to \"redo\" it and came out 10 minutes later. The server offered me a discount for the wait, I said \"thanks\".  

When my order finally came out, the steak was a lil undercooked for my liking, but I continue eating it until it got really bloody in the middle. The French fries were cold too. I told the server that I ordered the steak medium rare, she apologized and took it back. I told her that I don't want another one anymore and that I don't want it on my bill. The manager came over and told me that he can't take the item off my bill, the steak was done perfectly med rare, that it's supposed to be bloody and that I'm wrong. I told him that it's supposed to be pink throughout and red in the middle and that I know how I like my steaks (I have a lot of cooking experience). 3 other people in out group had their steak overcooked as well. He continue to tell me that he can't do anything about it, I said I'm not paying for this and that my experience since I've got there has been unpleasant. He gave me an ultimatum and said \"do you want the replacement or not?\". I said \"No, I'll gladly pay for a meal that I will enjoy and that this isn't it, and this is very bad customer service\". 

At the end of the night, we asked for the bill, and to no surprise it took 20 minutes for the bills to come out. When the she came with the bill, the manager followed her and sat at a bar about 10 feet away from me and watching me like a hawk. There were several mistakes on a few people's bills as well. One of my friends accidentally had a pitcher added on his bill, the manager said \"If you're not paying for it, someone else will!\". Which was very rude, when a simple, \"I'm sorry, let us fix/double check that\" is generally the right answer. I looked at my bill and I was charged the full price despite being offered a discount before. I was in no mood to dispute the price because I was just in a bad mood the whole time. A few dollars isn't going to win me over. 

Overall, I've never received service this bad in my life from every aspect from the food to the service from the second I got there till the minute I left. I am very easy going when it comes to eating out, coming from a hospitality and service background myself, I have never in my life not wanted to pay a bill or tip the person serving me. But there's a first for everything. You would think a place that just opened would want to treat their customers with respect. You don't get a second chance on first impression."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend after going to Wasaga beach. The restaurant was empty when we were there. It could be because it was a Sunday night. Service was not bad. However there were a lot of flies all over the restaurant because they had the doors opened. My boyfriend had to exchange his beer 5 times since flies kept going into his beer.  I had the honey salmon on the maple wood it was tasty. I enjoyed it. My boyfriend's ribs however was horrible. It was dry and had no sauce on it at all. Do not order this dish.  I gave this restaurant a 2 star because of my delicious salmon. Everything else was terrible. We will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Great prices. Great daily specials. Friendly staff. Cozy atmosphere. Always a great go to place."}
{"text":"Expecting the worst as this location has changed hands a few times. We were surprised at the clean decor and menu pricing. Food arrived fresh and quality was excellent for this type of fair. We will definitely stop in again before our night out."}
{"text":"Good mains and fries. We ordered burgers and they were DELICIOUS. However, wait times were long even to get seated and the food took forever. Our waitress was amazing though, super friendly and had good timing. My biggest complaint was that the salad (which i had switched out from fries) was super overdressed. Not sure why they were trying to drown the vegetables, considering they're not... sentient.."}
{"text":"I came here after a friend recommended it! I'm satisfied with the service, and the food!

They offer 1/2 price wings after 9pm, which were pretty good, but you don't get many wings for a \"1lb\" - about 8 small/medium size wings.

As per their food, it's definitely inexpensive, but you get more than your money's worth! It was pretty good, and I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"This is our second time here and again, this place has exceeded expectations. We ordered wings with the sauce on the side, because last time they were a little over-sauced and soggy, but still good. This time they were crispy. We also each got the chef salad, which is amazing. It has beets, chick peas, goat cheese and candied pecans - some chef salad! Everything was great. You just need to know to special-order things to get them the way you want."}
{"text":"This location used to be a Crabby Joe's. I was pleasantly surprised how far your dollar is stretched here and the quality of the food you get. 

First off, $5.00 for a burger with fries is quite unbelievable. When the burger comes to your table, you get a delicious burger that's charbroiled and a decent size that is satisfying. Add a $5.00 pint and you have a great meal for $10.00. 

Also order were $9.00 beef ribs which also comes with fries. 

There are drink specials and daily specials each day.  Was presently surprised at this place and definitely an improvement from Crabby Joe's. 

Not sure what the 3% fee is on top of every item on the menu but it really doesn't add up to much."}
{"text":"I should start this review off with that I have not eaten Chuck's IN the actual restaurant, but have ordered takeout 3 times and have been super happy every time I have.

First off, it's seemingly impossible to find good, inexpensive steakhouses in Canada. The Keg and Ruth's seem to be the only places and if you go there, you are gonna pay an arm, a leg, both eyebrows and a nipple. Anywhere cheaper, you can expect to find imitation steaks; they look like steaks, but they probably aren't steaks. 

Chuck's actually has STEAK, and for a good price (no nipples required). I was so impressed with my ribeye - cooked just how I liked it, seasoned perfectly and they let me keep my wallet. And they have cheese fries. Not Canadian cheese fries, where they sprinkle half a tablespoon of cheddar on like they are \"cheese bae\" or something, but

CHEESE. 

FRIES.

If I could bold \"cheese,\" it would still be an understatement. 

Overall, this is my new fave place to eat in Oakville. If you like good food without having to mortgage your house, hit up Chuck's. Save your nipples."}
