{"text":"Ok deli is deli.  It's monster sandwiches and comfort food.  I usually eat at Katzs on dufferin,  Pancers on Bathurst,  the old Coleman's etc..... Jewish style real deli.  This place is a mall food court type of place.  I ordered a big wolf 1/2 lb corned beef sandwich on a kaiser.  They weigh it to the Oz. Enough mustard for three sandwiches and weak. The sandwich was plain weak.  The other meats I observed were grocery store pre processed deli meats like Shopsy or Brandt,  kept in a fridge unlike old school steaming meat lockers. This meal left me hungry.  Better off going to subway.  For $15, my meal total,  I was better off going and getting my own sliced cold cuts and making my own sandwich. So disappointed. Yeah the owner is beautiful but damn man the sandwich sucked,  and the value for the money is plain bad...... Better off going to Peters at Dixie and Eglinton..... Calling it as I see it.  Those who know real deli might concur"}
{"text":"Great food and Staff...Rueben was fantastic.   Staff made a mistake on my order(trainee) but went way over and above to correct it and exceed my expectations."}
{"text":"Came here today on a whim with an extreme sandwich craving! Unfortunately the bakery that I usually frequent was closed, so I opted to try somewhere new - what a disappointment that decision became!   Upon entry, the 2 female staff were welcoming and friendly, and I was thoroughly impressed by the clean classy decor of the establishment. The compliments end there, to my dismay, since coming here for a simple sandwich with my boyfriend became a very expensive outing for lunch.   All I can say is this isn't a practical place to frequent meals at since 1 turkey sandwich and one \"Big Wolf\" sandwich with a bottle of Dasani cost over $30! Listen, if I'm paying for quality comfort food this is totally acceptable, though I was shocked at the humongous portions (1/4 or 1/2 lb meat options) which turned out to be overpriced cold cuts and cooked meat. Not impressed. Not to mention they don't exactly ask what you want on your sandwich either.... When I asked what mystery sauce she was slathering on, she simply responded \"you'll love it! It's delicious\" I didn't like it at all (smoked avocado of some sort I believe). Is to too much to ask your customer which sauce they'd prefer? Mayo would have sufficed.   Eating this monstrosity was a whole experience of its own. I ended up having to remove more than half the meat stacked onto this thing since it was falling apart rapidly. Again, not impressed. It was just unbearably messy and uncomfortable, considering we were dining in.   Overall, would I recommend this place? Hey, if you love large portions and don't mind spending the extra coin for it, then I wouldn't discourage. As for myself, I won't be returning since my impression was that I could have purchased the exact same quality bread and cold cuts from the grocery store and made sandwiches for myself for an entire week (probably cheaper than what I paid for one sandwich here!)."}
{"text":"Great deli sandwich. Service is friendly price is bang on. I have returned and every time is the same great food and service."}
{"text":"Second visit and smoked meat is perfect. Fresh rye and meat medium just the way it's meant to be. The Cole slaw is bang on. Will be back to try all the other yummy items on their menu. Owner and staff a real pleasure. Worth the drive but better for pick up as little room to hang out with more than a friend."}
{"text":"I found this little place just by chance.  I was with my son, and we stopped in this plaza just to see what was there.  So why not mosey on in and give it a try.  The place is clean and for a small shop its trendy and friendly.  We had the pulled pork sandwiches and they were good, actually rather tasty.  It could have maybe had a bit more meat in the sandwich for my taste, and for the price,  but still it was tasty.  Now on the side with this combo is coleslaw, and that was excellent, and that pickle was rather awesome too.  I think i will come back soon to try something else.  That meatball sandwich looked rather appealing.  The glutton in me says go back and give it a try"}
{"text":"Just ate the beef dip   OMG   I am soooo happy they just opened   I had my girl with me and she had the Reuben.... Killer!!!! Words can't describe how much we love Big Wolf's! We are now certified regulars"}
{"text":"Service was excellent food was tasty First time of had good deli meat outside of Montreal so well done"}
{"text":"First Impression: the employees were very welcoming and helpful. They walked me through the menu and after some thinking I decided to try their Big Wolf's Reuben.   The Experience: they make the Rueben with Corned Beef, Sauerkraut, Swiss cheese topped on Marble Bread (which has butter on one side and Big Wolf's secret sauce on the inside). They grab a brisket of corned beef from their meat steamer (piping hot) and they place it on an automatic slicer.  They usually cut the meat nice and thin (better taste) or you can request to have it cut thicker. After weighing out the meat (it's a lot I only got a 1/4 lb) they put it on the sandwich and add all the ingredients. Then they take it to the panini press so it can toast the bread and melt the Swiss cheese (which is real genuine cheese so that's a plus). It's then served with a side of coleslaw or potato salad (I couldn't choose so I took a bit of both) with a pickle on the side.   The Taste: my first bite into the Reuben and I seriously couldn't believe how good it was. All the ingredients melted into the sandwich perfectly to create a mixture that was absolutely delicious. I have never had a Reuben this good. The potato salad and coleslaw were also very appetizing (I wasn't expecting much because I'm not a fan of both, but this recipe is definitely worth it). I also purchased a bottled coke and I must say it just tastes better bottled than it would in a can.   The employees took the time to ask me how my meal was and make sure I had everything I needed. For a quick dining restaurant, the customer service was far better than expected. I would definitely come back here and try their Pulled pork (I had a small sample and it was incredible).   Would recommend to others looking for a filling hearty meal that's affordable in a clean environment."}
{"text":"The bread is fresh, and the meat is tender and tasty. That's all you need for a good sandwich, really.  However, their efficiency is a problem and it seems like they don't know what they're doing. They offered to put my crunchy onions on the side so they didn't get soggy on my sandwich till I got home, but they apparently forgot to put them in the bag. There are a few other kinks as well, but I think the ultimate problem is too many moving pieces, and they either need one more employee or a simpler system.  Everything about this shop just seems a little slow and unsure. Make sure to check your bag so you're sure you have everything before you go, and walk in with a little extra patience. The place has potential, I hope they run smoother. Meanwhile, I'll still give them my business."}
{"text":"Aesthetic:  Not a ton of seating. More of a takeout. They have the bar type seating against the wall with a chalkboard and chalk for some play.  Stools have a nice backrest (although mine was very wobbly).  I'd replace the bench outside with a table and 2 chairs.  The menu wasn't hard to understand but could still have benefited from a better designer.  I feel like they could do more branding with the Wolf image.   Food: Loved seeing them cut the meat in front of me. You could choose lean or fat, thicker cuts, etc.  I ordered the Chefs Reuben on Marble Rye. It takes a bit longer since it's a hot item, but it was well worth it. Everything tastes excellent. For only the 1/4 of meat it was still big and under $10.  For my sides I tried the coleslaw and the potato salad. They do a non-creamy coleslaw which I love. It had a pickle to top off and I was stuffed and satisfied. They also offer classic coke bottles.  Too bad they don't offer fries.   Service: Very friendly. Seem to be actually educated on their meats and can customize some things.  A sign says they give you a retro coke glass with a purchase of a Big Bad Wolf.    From some quick chit chatting I learned how much pride they take in their process and recipes. I feel like the branding and design doesn't reflect that. I think they should market that more. The brand design might have been benefited from a more artisan/craft feel. Look forward to going back and trying the pastrami!"}
{"text":"3-3.5* - Bumped up 'cause the girl who was working there was really friendly!  Decent for what it is, deli...lite.  It's a \"deli\", but reminiscent of a Subway, in a suburban strip mall that serves smoked meat sandwiches + others and steamies as well.  Not much in terms of atmosphere, after all it's new Oakville.  I haven't eaten all that many smoked meat sandwiches, but this one was pretty alright.  Sliced paper thin, not dry, not super fatty, and not overly salted.  Bread was fresh.  And I was able to choose what type of Mustard:  Regular, Honey Dijon, & Spicy.  Girl who was running the show gave me BOTH coleslaw + potato salad since it was my first visit.  She said the owner makes her own potato salad, but didn't know where the coleslaw was from.  Smoked meat is shipped in from Montr√©al.  One thing that I did notice was that there wasn't the option of fries.  I asked the girl about it and she said that they serve healthy food and if they offered fries it would sorta negate the health-aspect.  Food was fine, but I wouldn't really expect the atmosphere of a deli.  It's more of a takeout."}
{"text":"The Good: sandwich tasted excellent and ingredients were fresh along with a generous amount of meat; service was friendly.  The Bad: They were a little stingy with the coleslaw (half a container).  The Ugly: Took my son to the washroom and it was a mess but in all fairness management acted promptly to address that issue when I mentioned it.   Verdict: I'd go back and try the other sandwiches and provide updates. It's nice that they're only a 5 minute walk from my house."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant today with a couple of my friends and loved the selection. You can customize any sandwich you want, and or choose from their pre-set menu. Fairly priced and huge portions!   Location - prime location for a good neighborhood bite!   Sandwiches- 10 choices of different types of bread. A handful of topping selections and several sauce options. I ordered the Reuben and Meatball sandwiches with a side of coleslaw, & potato salad (as seen in my pics). I loved both of them. They were very fresh (even if it was close to closing time). One thing I can say that was extraordinary was their FRESH bread! Well made and put together. One thing that I would change would be the pickle. Kosher pickles are a bit strong and I like sweet. Still love the combo with the sandwich!   Staff- very friendly and helpful! Very family friendly, and really good at recommending sandwiches. Great team work.   Cleanliness & appearances - Well kept. Staff is ALWAYS cleaning in between customers. Great interior design."}
{"text":"Friends told me about this Deli place and absolutely fell inlove with it. Drive from Woodbridge to get sandwiches and chile. The big wolfs Ruben is amazing! Staff is very friendly and welcoming. Glad I came here and love coming back!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, not bad food. They are understaffed, and need another person to help out.  Especially on the weekend lunch rush.  Pricey for what you're actually getting, $5 for a grilled cheese sandwich. Everything else is an add on.  Bottom line: it's worth a try if you're right there. But I don't think I'm going to go back. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"First time here, based on a recommendation from a colleague. Had the Turkey Poblano (sp). Awesome sandwich. Fresh meat, veg and bread. Little potato salad and chips on the side. Why go to Subway or Tim's? This place is great! Definitely going back."}
