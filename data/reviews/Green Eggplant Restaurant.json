{"text":"Have always enjoyed coming here in the past.  Last night I had the Mediterranean Filet Mignon Salad - yech!  There is no way that was Filet Mignon, unless it was sliced paper thin - it was like stewed minute steak and tasted like liver.  One asparagus spear in the whole salad, and the whole thing was drowning in dressing.  Murphy's Law down the street does a fantastic steak salad and I was expecting something similar.  Vast disappointment.  We queried our waiter as to the type of steak it was, and he said it was filet mignon - really?  I asked for it rare and of course that was impossible with a piece of meat that was at best,  1/4\" thick.  Our bill was reduced by just over $3.  DO NOT ORDER THIS SALAD. My husband had the Paella, which he's enjoyed here before.  He had me taste it near the end of our meal, as he mentioned it had an odd taste - he's the kind of guy who will pretty well eat anything.  After I tasted it, I concurred, and told him I would not have been able to eat it had I ordered it.  We are truly not overly fussy, but this meal left a very bad taste in both our mouths.  This is not a fine dining establishment, but in the past we have had good food here.  We will not go back again, and as mentioned, had been coming here several times a year for a long time.  A real disappointment that its standards have sunk so low."}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant twice now when I have friends from out of town.  Very satisfied with the food quality. Had the kabab and rice and soup well seasoned. The complimentary bread and dip are awesome. Service can be a little late due to the fact the restaurant is always busy. But worth the visit."}
{"text":"The staff was very rude - one guy in between, a non native English sppeaking man. I asked him a few uqestiosna dn he asked \"what my point was\". Not very friendship or helpful"}
{"text":"I was surprised to see the place was still crowded when our group walked by on Tuesday around 9 pm.     The food is really good and the portions are huge."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's so close to home and whenever I crave a decent breakfast this is my go-to spot, so much so that the servers all smile and say hello when I walk in :)   I usually have the California egg white omelette but this time I had the Mediterranean with a side of potato latkes. It was a lot of food for one person:cream cheese, feta,  hummus, three eggs, toast, tomatoes with olives and pesto AND a small garden salad.  It was so delicious, the eggs were done to perfection. I was happy with the corner table near the fire place  since I was on my own and wanted to read.  It wasn't as busy as it usually is but it's probably because it was such a beautiful day people were outside.  They moved from a bigger spot a couple of blocks away but they've made it work.  The service was good, the girl who served my was friendly and professional.  I will always come back to the friendly ambience and the great food served up by the Green Eggplant."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this restaurant for almost seven years and have never been disappointed. Their staff is awesome, food is fresh and tasty and the atmosphere is a lot of fun.   It's great for breakfast, lunch, dinner or if  you're just having a drink with friends."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat! Everything I've tried from there (salads, sandwiches, burgers) have all been amazing and the portions are enormous. This place has a bit of everything and the 3 dips they serve prior to your meal are delicious! The place is usually packed and, especially during the summer, you may have to wait a bit."}
{"text":"HUGE PORTIONS.  And we totally got hung up on the dip, eggplant sweet BBQ something, baba gahnoush, and hummus. I love hummus, but oddly enough the other two dips were the winners.  We ate three baskets of bread and a double serving of dips...... and the waiter just refilled as if he knew, just knew.   If you're going to go crazy on the dips, just take an appetizer. The meals/sandwiches/everything are HUGE. Three piece sandwiches that we could only eat a third of after consuming all that wonderful and delicious dip (and a house salad).  The margaritas are also HUGE and will make you happy.  This place is amazing, great atmosphere, great service, wonderful for a day at The Beaches."}
{"text":"Just i love with their oversized bellinis, though they may have stopped using those gigantic glasses:(   The place has one of the best chicken pennes and brings a little appetizer dish (free) before the food is on the table...  I've been to both locations (yes, there is one on Eglinton) and they are both phenomenal   The portions are descent and very reasonable priced for the quality"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's so close to home, the prices are reasonable and they also have take out.  The dressing they have for their house salad is what keeps me going back, I've even tried to replicate it at home. Have come close but I think I missed an ingredient or two.  Doesn't matter because they sell their salad dressing!  They deserve an extra star just for that!  I have tried some of their other stuff: for example the grilled salmon is really good. Their smoothies are also a must especially on a hot summer day! And their quesidillas are also pretty good.  Service is always cordial and friendly."}
{"text":"I've been there twice and I love the food and atmosphere, you get a lots of food for what you pay . The service is ok I've never had any problem with services, the only things make me give it 2 out of 5 is the cleanness ,which is as important as food itself, the container on the table for condiments are dirty as well as the table itself, you can see coffee stains and finger prints all over the stuff on the table the basket of bread has a lots of greasy residue on them, I don't think they have been washed for a while , lots of food pieces on the floor. I would have give it 5 out 5 if the restaurant would clean up  better."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for the last 10 years, because of the amazing food, as well as the service. Today I brought my friend with me, we had good meal but a terrible service. We have to ask more than two times to get what we want, plus the host a lady, which I didn't catch her name, never even came once to our table to ask how we are doing, if we want anything, to check what we are missing. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"The place has a cool vibe, but thats about it ! Food is more on a \"quantity vs quality\" scale. Was very surprised to find this out, as the massive crowds outside led me to believe it must be great. Lots of better places to eat in the beach....head east on queen to Absolute Cafe"}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious and always consistently fresh. I've never had a better house salad anywhere in my life. The best dish on the menu is the schnitzel. I always go here when I'm starving because portions are massive :)"}
{"text":"4.5 stars is not an option but thats what I gave it:). First time eating here and I was not disappointed. I ordered Cedar planked salmon, with grilled vegetables and red smashed potatoes. Came with a starter house or Caesar salad... And the complimentary fresh bread with eggplant tapenade, garlic dip, and the best hummus I've had since my Mom's homemade hummus. If you love garlic you are in for a treat! My date ordered the Mediterranean chicken salad. Everything was great. The cedar planked salmon and Caesar salad was 18.99, which I thought was very reasonable. I've had similar dishes at the keg for about $10 more, and the veg is better here. Our total bill came too about $65, that included 2 glasses of wine and 1 Long Island iced tea. Bam. I'll be back.  P.S. someone at the table next to us ordered the steak sandwich and it looked amazeballs. I think it would be pretty hard to go wrong here."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. Had the take out, salad was very packed inside the box. Very generous proportions but it is a but pricey. Would go there on a formal date."}
{"text":"My BF brought me here for lunch on sat and we really enjoyed ourselves! Upon walking in I was surprised the interior was decorated so nicely since the outside did not make the restaurant look like anything spectacular. The brick walls were dressed up with pretty pictures and really gave the resto a cozy family ish feeling. Service-wise our waitress was good, our glasses were never empty and she cleared our plates in a timely fashion.  So we started off with bread with 3 types of dipping sauces which were all super yummy (sorry I don't know what they are exactly but this is a perfect excuse to go back to find out!) My boyfriend ordered a burger which he struggled to finish and I had the asparagus and feta eggs benedict. It was SOOOOO yummy, and I appreciated how they did not drown my eggs in hollandaise sauce.  I really can't wait to go back to try their other items. I'd probably try their salads because they looked huge and delicious. I'm definitely planning to have my summer filled with time spent at the beach and Green Eggplant."}
{"text":"I just found out that Green Eggplant closed! This is truly a sad day."}
{"text":"I love Green Eggplant.  I feel like a lot of other posters have already pointed out most of the great things about this place, and as much as I want to write a 5 paragraph post about their Beef Goulash Soup, I don't want to make myself hungry right now!  Pros: large portions, good choices on the menu, great value, beautiful interior for a casual place, good service, good food.  We head down to the Green Eggplant whenever we're in the Beach and always joke (actually, I'm pretty serious when I say this) that if they had an Etobicoke location I'd be in there for lunch every day. On one occasion our food came out after a long time and didn't taste very good (soup and shrimp ap. were clearly nuked), but considering we've eaten here around 20 times I'm extremely satisfied with the restaurant and the quality of its food."}
{"text":"a really good place to eat if you are in the area. the food portions are massive! the only downside is that it can get really really busy depending on the day and time so you might have to wait a bit for a table."}
{"text":"Always amazing food at the green eggplant. Their salmon is to die for. portions are a bit small and the prices are a bit much, but that's typical in the beach area.  Servers are always really nice and friendly, overall a great experience and must dine atleast once!"}
{"text":"4 out of 5! A hidden treasure for those trapped in the core bubble! Amazing chicken salad and chicken schnitzel! $$"}
{"text":"Decided to try it out from a friend's recommendation.  Arrived with a party of four.  Parking is a little hard to find on the street, but there's a Green-P about two blocks east of here @ $2/hr.  They start you off with some nice soft and crunchy breads and spreads.  The spreads are really really good.  My friend ordered a Bellini, and it was massive!  The thing was the size of her face! Anyways, she said it was good, so I believe her.  I'll order it next time.  I ordered the Pina Colada, and it was very good.  Blended very well, and rich.  Onto the mains, two of us ordered the Mexican Spicy burger, and the other two ordered salads.  I won't be talking about salads, cause you know, they're salads.  Anyhow, the burgers were awesome!  You can really taste the crispy bacon and the smoky Gouda cheese.  The burger was so juicy, it was dripping down my face.  They use a kind of cheese bun, which makes it even better.  Use the bun to wipe your face, cause you don't want that precious juice to go to waste!  Totally recommend this place.  Great crowd, and great staff.  Prices are decent too!"}
{"text":"This my hands-down favorite place to eat in the Beaches!! It's in a prime location to boot and quite popular, but I've never waited more than 10 minutes for a table.  The Green Eggplant offers a wide and diverse menu of veggie and non-veggie options destined to please even the pickiest palate!!  I've tried a new and different dish on each and every visit, and have had no complaints, only praise and compliments!  I have even ordered one of their drinks called a \"Bellini,\" and I didn't like it...turns out the reason why was cuz there was champagne in it (which I don't like...gasp!) Without question our server replaced it with something that I did like and didn't even charge me for the Bellini!  I recommend the Green Eggplant for their good eats, amazingly wide variety of food offered, and their efficient and friendly staff.  I, personally, don't go to or avoid restaurants for their décor, although they do have lovely door/windows in the front that they open during warmer weather to let the sunshine in."}
{"text":"Probably the best food places at the beaches. Whenever, I am in the area I eat here as the food is good. There is always a line up and the wait time varies between 15-30 mins. However, it is worth it. Some of the best Daiquiris and Martini I have ever had. They come in a huge glass and costs less then $10. Also, they have some of the best bread dip which is complimentary while you wait for your food. Although it is a mediterian place there sandwich and wraps are really good.  Only DRAW BACK are some of the WAITERS. There is one guy, we call him- \"Sweat man\" sadly he is always sweating despite the time of the year, and yes even when he is serving you food. We try our best to not be seated in his areas but it doesn't always help. And to add to his charm he is also rude. The term RUDE can be used for a lot of the waiters at this location. However, the owner and the management is nonchalant regarding their attitude towards the customers which is disappointing."}
{"text":"Great food, service is terrible. They have one long term waiter that just couldn't care less. He is slow and rude. I hate being seated in his section as the service is always awful, the other waiters are okay but overall the restaurant needs a better customer service outlook. I have always enjoyed the food and continue going for the food and just try to get over the awful service."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service isn't always really good.  Theres one guy in there than usually looks grumpy and could smile a tad more."}
{"text":"Delicious! Had their chicken shish kebabs and was amazed at how big the portion was! $16.99 for two skewers with 5-6 pieces of chicken which were half the size of my fist! So tender and delicious! Their dips with their bread is good too! Service was great! Only downside was that we had to wait 30 min at 9pm on a Friday night for a table for 3."}
{"text":"Green eggplant - FOCUS on QUALITY not QUANTITY   Like so many North American restaurants, Green Eggplant, a staple in the beaches, has fallen victim to the more is more - in terms of menu selection and portions. If you are 250 lb rugby player dining after a tournament, then perfect... but for the average person you need to either take home a doggy bag, share between 2 people or have them toss a ton of food away.  It would be far preferable to have them lower the prices by 5-10% and cut down the portions by 20-25%! Their profits would increase and their focus can return to the quality not the ginormous portions...   I have eaten at the Eggplant more times than I can recall - and they do a few things really well - great little sauces with the bread upon arrival, excellent friendly staff, nice cozy family friendly environment, good breakfasts, their grilled fish is usually great but I am hearing more and more from loyal Eggplant locals that the quality is tanking and they are looking for other options. Hopefully they can make some changes and keep their loyal patrons on side...!"}
{"text":"Service and prices are decent, but food not so much...unless you're more interested in quantity over quality.  Large portions and extensive menu. Appears to be a popular family restaurant (based on my two brunch experiences). So, if you're not in the mood for children, avoid this place.  After my more recent visit, I was happy to hit the nearby Starbucks for a soy latte."}
{"text":"I am a regular who has never had a bad experience here. All the food is delicious with large portions. Good variety on the menu also."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Great atmosphere, the staff is friendly and the Mediterranean salad is to die for. Portion sizes are huge (you can get 2 meals out of 1), but the prices are very expensive for what it is. I barely eat here anymore based on how expensive the restaurant is. 1 Med salad w/ chicken is around $26 pre tax."}
{"text":"Meh...  This place was okay, but not great.  They certainly give you a ton of food, but really, who can finish all of that?   I had the grilled vegetable salad sans chicken and my date had a humongous chicken sandwich with salad AND fries.   Pretty good beer selection and fun cocktails that make you feel like you're on vacation, but won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"went there with friend for dinner. not busy at all. waited 20 minutes for waiter to take a drink order. then another 15 to place order after multiple attempts to call over. I ordered the quesodilla appetizer portion for dinner with soup starter, at which waiter told me not to get the soup because the quesodilla was enough!? while my friend was enjoying her appetizer, I was left with nothing. when appetizer came out, it was wrong order. taste was bland and presentation was glutenous and unappetizing. this is the third visit and it gets consistently worse. not recommended. poor service, bland food, not what I ordered. diner beware"}
{"text":"When this place first opened it was excellent; me and my friends were goingly weekly. Now? I only go if I absolutely have too. The food is okay, it seems to be prepared so much now I feel it's just heated in a microwave.  The service is the absolute worst! It takes at least 30-40 minutes just to get the bill, even after we've demanded it from our waiter 3 or 4 times.    The caesar salad is a bland toss of leaves with maybe 4 (I think I had 5 once) small croutons and sprinkled parmesan.   Although, the free bread and dip in the beginning is delicious."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during the week, it was a pleasant find! Portions are enormous! Great value for your dollar!   My friend and I were both intrigued by the schnitzel, so we were going to share that along with an avocado chicken sandwich. The server kindly suggested that the schnitzel would be a large enough portion for 2 to share and she was right! It was the chicken schnitzel dinner with a side of sweet potato fries, the order came with a side salad and we ordered an additional side salad so that we could each have one.  A simple side salad was fresh and good, large portion for a side with a very nice house dressing.  The schnitzel was good, but if left too long, I think it would continue to get cooked because of the heat and eventually feel dry.  But it came with a nice mayo and jalapeno(?) dipping sauce.  One could also never go wrong with sweet potato fries!   I really enjoyed the complementary bread with 3 assorted dips, the eggplant dip was quite enjoyable along with humus and the relish (?) mayo.  All in all a very enjoyable meal and I would definitely come back to try the brunch!"}
{"text":"We were at the Beaches the other day and saw that a line was starting to form outside this restaurant. So of course we had to see what the fuss was all about!  The place was packed (it was the Thursday evening before the Good Friday holiday) but we didn't really need to wait that long (15 mins max maybe?). We wished though that they had a bigger waiting area, or at least a warmer one...anyway.  The interior was cozy and like another reviewer already mentioned, it did get a little noisy. Service was friendly and quick.  I got the chicken shish kebob (with house salad and basmati rice) and my friend ordered the salmon fillet with white wine cream sauce (with caesar salad and mashed potato). My chicken was juicy and grilled just right. Even without the sauce that came with it, it was so tasty. Two skewers came out to about 9 pieces of chicken, which was way too much for me. Had enough to take home and eat for lunch the next day!  The salmon, although also very good, was swimming in the cream sauce. If you like that sort of thing, you may appreciate the extra (extra extra) sauce but I would have preferred the sauce cut in half. It would have been just as delicious.  What you MUST stay away from, however, is the peach bellini, which tasted so much like Robitussin (or whatever your cough syrup preference!).   All in all though, it was a great meal. Was about $50 for two. So not so bad, as the servings are huge. Would definitely go back and try other items in the menu like the trout and maybe their salads."}
{"text":"Green Eggplant was a life-saver while my kitchen was getting reno'd. Skip their website, it is awful; just go eat there.  The portions are HUGE! which was handy because I was able to take the left overs home for a snack.  Some dishes are so large they could really be dinner for two.  Why this restaurant is on my review list is the value and the bread basket. You get more than you pay for which is always a win in my book. The bread basket though is what makes this good but restaurant a great restaurant.  It is a basket of three different types of bread and buns which is served with a tray of hummus, eggplant spread and baba ghanoush.  Who knew eggplant was so delicious?   Service is reasonable but the place can get crazy in the summer around supper time so make a reservation if you can't wait for a seat. The prices are very reasonable and you can eat there plus beverage for $30 and be absolutely stuffed.  The menu is varied so there should be something for everyone."}
{"text":"Not many restaurants in Toronto offer free bread with delicious dips and a big plate of fresh salad with dressing for free along with the main course. It's enough for two persons. This is no doubt THE BEST restaurant. The service is always courteous. So stop complaining you fussy lot."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant and our standard go to! Just got back from vacation and we hit it up on the way home from the airport - never disappointed!  Chicken shish kebobs with sweet potato fries and house salad - do it - you won't be disappointed. For take out its enough for 2 people!  Have tried almost everything on the menu and it's all delicious! Great prices, value and comfortable place to take kids too!"}
{"text":"Great food, the dips that come before the meal are especially good. Liked the old location better but the patio, while small, is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Sorry I just don't understand the attraction to this place... maybe it is simply a matter of quantity over quality.  Went here for dinner recently, had this Asian noodle dish with shrimp and if I recall correctly it also included chicken.  The wait staff suggested it was good.  It was poor at best; the noodles seemed more like spaghetti and it was boring.  Moreover, this sounded like the most flavourful item on the menu.  My friend  had a club sandwich that she believes included processed chicken, i.e., something other then real chicken breast meat.  Again the serving size are huge so I say again quantity over quality.  The food was so underwhelming it not worth commenting on the other aspects.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Last time I went to Green Eggplant I found they had revised their menu! My big huge wonderful salad is gone replaced by those more \"popular\", Greek, cesear, oriental..... I got the portobello and chicken penne, it was good but dense and the portobellos were lacking. Also everything seems to have pesto aioli on it... What's up with that?! Our server last time was a true idiot, we did half of his job for him, picking up dishes and rearranging plates on the table for room...isn't that your job? To see an empty plate and clear it? My old faithful has let me down."}
{"text":"Though it's a long trek from downtown, I always make the trip when I'm craving the best Greek Salad ever.  Their house dressing, along with the pita and homemade dips to kick off the meal-outstanding, well priced and never disappoint!  Tip: Add the sirloin to the salad."}
{"text":"Whenever my mother and I do lunch, we end up at the Green Eggplant. There are other restaurants in the area, but why settle for good when you can have great. On my last trip, I had the Salmon, which exactly hit the spot. The three dips they bring out at the beginning of the meal were exactly as they always are; perfect! Seriously better than many that you have to order and pay for.   Good bang for your buck $$$ wise too! We both took home doggy bags."}
{"text":"I tend to always have the Filet Mignon salad and I always love it. Its a mix of healthy greens with the steak. The portions are quite big (Reasonably priced - about $13-$15  if I remember correctly) and although I am usually full at the 85% completion point, I finish it as its mostly greens....staff is always courteous and the place is clean....doesnt hurt that I live very close to it so very convenient (for me).  I want to also point out that the bread and the dips pre meal are pretty good as well. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"*I would rate this as a 4.5 if I could, but I definitely can't lean towards a 5 because I've only been here once.*   Anyways, onto the review! First things first, this restaurant is conveniently located in the Beaches and is a great dinner or lunch location after a leisure day strolling through the area. Kinda difficult to spot if you don't know where it is, but after the first time visiting you should be able to remember the place pretty well. My group and I came in last Sunday around lunch time and even then the place was PACKED. Like when I say packed I don't mean there just weren't enough seats, I mean every table is within such close vicinity- but what are ya gonna do about it, it's the Beaches. Despite the cramped space, the restaurant is still pretty nice and has it's own charm without a doubt (p.s: A+ for the innovative hanging lightbulbs as lighting fixtures, it's actually really nice, just don't be a goof like me and bump into them when you get up).   Now let's dig into the food!. Ok, so I went with three other people and all of us ordered completely different things. Something important to note, we spent more time deciding what we were going to get from the plethora of options than we spent waiting for the food to be served. Usually that would scare me, but the food was fresh and was clearly made in house, you can even see the kitchen since they've got this visible kitchen type concept going on.   As for the individual food we got, I'll start with my Mediterranean Feta Burger which comes served with either fresh fries or a salad (house or Caesar) .The House Salad, which is a typical house salad, served as a huge portion despite it being a SIDE for a meal, is absolutely delicious. I can't even begin to describe the dressing, it's sweet, yet tangy, and difficult to dissect into individual flavours. Whatever they put in there, it's amazing. Definitely recommend. Now for the burger, it's also quite impressing, both in size and taste. It really stays true to its name, its got the feta, onions, roasted red pepper, and represents the Mediterranean flavours well. Burger is a 4/5, it's juicy, flavourful, and is a decent size. Only down size: it's messy cause it's so juicy, so it's a pro that comes with a reasonable con I guess?? Okay, also want to point out I was served FRIES with my burger too... I wasn't suppose to get them cause I ordered a salad as a side, but they gave them to me anyways. I didn't ask for them, but hey I ain't complaining.   As for the rest of my group, they ordered a Classic burger, Mediterranean Salmon Salad, and Rainbow Trout, respectively. Pretty much all of the reviews were positive,  and everyone's overall consensus was that the portions were huge. The Classic burger received praise because of its cooked through, yet not overcooked or dry patty. The Rainbow Trout was also complimented for its fine execution (nicely seasoned and cooked) as it is dish that is more than easy to screw up. As for the salad, \"Good salmon, good portion, nice dressing, fulling\" were the general comments.   The service was also great, our waiter was very kind and was interactive with us, no fake smiles and chitchat.   Overall, this place is a definite recommend as the food is really worth the price and doesn't leave you feeling like you're still hungry or ashamed at what you've shelled out of your wallet."}
{"text":"This is one of those hidden gems you get lucky enough to either find or get brought to.  In our case we were celebrating a friend's birthday.  I'm giving this place a strong 4 stars.  Food was excellent, we had the chicken schnitzel and chicken shish-kabob. The portions were huge, one of the first times I actually brought food home! The decor was lovely, well lit and tonight being -30c the heat was turned on perfectly. The wait staff was friendly, knowledgable with outstanding service. It didn't get the 5th star because if I had to pick a bad thing, it's that there's no parking other than street. Not a huge deal."}
{"text":"The food is really good. The portions are huge. Definitely consider sharing. They don't take reservations (unless they're big groups) so the wait can be long."}
{"text":"The service was just plain snarky. Our food all came out cold, and at very, very different times, and it was incredible that no server even came to ask us how our food was. Also, I found it sad that the place was full of families, when clearly, some of the servers are not trained to deal with children. Small children can be indecisive or messy eaters, but as long as they're not making the restaurant experience awful for other customers, why treat them and their parents with disdain? It was sad to witness this.  I feel like the Green Eggplant envisions itself to be a posh supper club, and they resent their popularity with the young-families-at-brunch set. I never give one-star reviews because I realize that this could have been an off-day for the servers and chefs, but unfortunately, this place really deserves it."}
{"text":"Update: Just so everyone knows the prices are decent, we came for a quick meal this week. Ordered just our meals. You get: The bread and 3 dipping sauces appetizer (free) The opening salad - garden salad or caesar (free) The meal (I ordered a burger and fries, girlfriend got the chicken skewers)  We just had water.  Tax in, it was $32. That's a pretty reasonable price for a full meal (without drinks).  Just saying..."}
{"text":"Wild portobello and goat cheese sandwich was delightful! Like others mentioned, the bread/hummus/eggplant provided was a nice touch as well. Excellent service. Went for dinner tonight (Friday), on one of the nicest days of the stoping so far and only had to wait five minutes for a table. Would go again!"}
{"text":"This place was OK.  When I ordered the Spanish Paella, IT WAS VERY SALTY.  I COULDN'T FINISH IT EVEN THOUGH I LOVE TO EAT FOOD AND PAELLA IS MY FAVORITE. The Caesar salad was good and the dips and bread were very delicious.  The second time I came here the Caesar salad was horrible because there was tons of Parmesan cheese on it, so much it must have been an accident because nobody in this world would put that much Parmesan in a salad.  I tried the Angel Hair Pasta with Jumbo Shrimp, it was good but the only problem i had were that the carrots in it were undercooked and i nearly choked on it."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Decor is nice and the vegetarian penne is to die for!"}
{"text":"Came here because there is often a line out front -- not sure why! The eggs, salad, and potatoes are good and the coffee unlimited (although often needed to ask for refills). The bacon and toast were undercooked and cold upon arrival - like they'd been cooked well in advance. Brimming with kids - very family friendly. It was good enough but not good enough to go again."}
{"text":"Usually very good. They bring out tasters of eggplant dishes and bread before your meal. Clean, vibrant atmosphere. Their pasta is always done very well. Good coffee. My only complaint is the grilled cheese that I had for brunch recently. Made with processed cheese. Oh my."}
{"text":"Don't really understand why this place gets such great reviews. Not that it's bad or anything. Food is very basic and average. It's a great place to go if you're not sure of your groups taste as everything is pretty basic and good. Portions are generous. They also give you some middle eastern dips and bread for the table, which is nice.   Be careful, they've added a few extra tables in some not so great spots (where waiters need to walk or too close to the chilly doorway)"}
{"text":"Such a cute restaurant. Portions are huge! Love the house salad. Great fries! Fresh food. I ordered the veggie burger. It was so amazing. I also like the dips and bread that they give you when you arrive."}
{"text":"The Green Eggplant. Odd name. Come to think of it, the entire place is sort of odd. I find the decor to be odd, and the outside storefront to be odd as well. I like it.   The decor really isn't all that odd, I just wanted it to fit into my theme. It's small and cozy, as always I love the exposed brick. The design is somewhat rustic.  The food itself was alright. I've been once. I had a burger and fries. The burger was a little more cooked than I prefer, but still had a nice flavor and consistency. I liked it just fine.   My server wasn't the best I've ever had, but she did alright. She was fairly busy so I actually understand. She got the job done and nothing took a ridiculous amount of complaints.   The Green Eggplant, not bad. The prices aren't bad, and their menu is pretty varied. I recommend a visit at least once."}
{"text":"Before it moved to a new location I think this was an OK restaurant. However this evening was terrible. I ordered the pasta carbonara with a Caesar salad. The pasta had no flavor whatsoever and the salad was so wilted. In the original location they had individual pepper mills on each table. Because the food was so tasteless I tried to order some cheese to put on top of the pasta to give it some flavour.  The waitress was rude both when we arrived and when I asked for some cheese she looked at me with a long face. I will never go back to this restaurant again. And it's hard here in the beaches area of Toronto as there are so few good restaurants. Another one bites the dust."}
{"text":"Love this place and go here all the time. I can't get enough of their ginormous salads and I think I'm addicted to their house salad dressing. Salad, burgers and sandwiches are very good here, although I can't say I've loved the pasta or paella. Upgrade to sweet potato fries if you want to indulge!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Certainly one of the better restaurants in the Beach. From their tasty pastas to their steak and eggs breakfast, you can't go wrong with this menu.   They also have incredible service! Very attentive and personable waiters and waitresses greet you and give you a sense of appreciation.   Definitely will continue to go to this establishment."}
{"text":"I'm biased. Last time my gf and I were here the brunch was awesome. Just eggs bennys with asparagus, but I've been to many places where they don't make them tasty. Here, it was great. It was a sunday brunch and there were not too many people in. Great for the chef to spend some extra time on your food. However, we went back on a Saturday and it was packed. Gf got the Bennys again-far from what we got the first time. She asked for medium eggs, they were soft and mushy, the sauce wasn't really good either. I ordered the house specialty goulash soup which had barely any potatoes in it, and tAsted like a minestrone soup... It was watery too I had to send it back.  I will give the place a third chance as it is tied right now. Prices are $$ and service is always good."}
{"text":"Definitely my go-to brunch spot whenever I'm introducing friends to The Beach. Quick service, friendly staff and great food be it breakfast, lunch or dinner.   You can tell it's good as the place has been around for awhile as other places around them are shutting down as new ones come up. It's definitely one of the best spots to grab a bite in the west side of The Beach(es)."}
{"text":"OK! Before I begin my review, I need to apologize for being away on Yelp this past month due to a new position at work. Obviously, my learning curve was steeper than I had anticipated...but now that my brain has absorbed all it can, I can now go back to being a regular at Yelp:)  Let me start with Green Eggplant, a restaurant I have heard as being \"bang for your buck.\" Green Eggplant is always packed for brunch, but my mom and I were in the area, so we decided to check this restaurant out.  Intro. The place was not busy for a Sunday night, but my mom and I were there at 5pm. Service was a little slow in the beginning, but we were offered bread with a selection of 3 spreads: garlic, roasted tomato, and hummus. I thought this was a nice change to the butter and I was loving the roasted tomato spread. I quickly gobbled up 4 slices of bread.  Food. My mom ordered the Hungarian Beef Soup which, according to the menu, is a rich soup with a tomato base. Luckily we only ordered one of this soup because it is BIG! The waiter was smart to bring an extra bowl for sharing. My mom had the Steak Burger and I the Spanish Paella. As a warning, the Paella is HUGE! I couldn't finish mine so I had it as take out.   All in all, this isn't fine dining, but definitely a good place for groups considering how cheap it is. My paella was big enough to share for 2-3 people, yet the dish was priced at $15.99. in addition, it had lots of flavours with musses, shrimp, and chicken. Portions are generous here and for the price, the food is not bad.  Booze. I had a quick look at the list, specifically wine, and I have to say that bottles are decently priced here. The Yellow Label is $32 for a bottle, whereas at other restaurants, I have had it at $49. Bottles range from $29-$33 which in my opinion, is as good as it gets.  Total dinner price for two, including 3 glasses of Chianti ($7.99/glass) came out to $85 with tax and tip. If you're looking for a casual place where food is good and inexpensive, I would recommend Green Eggplant. I am not sure if they take reservations, but they do for very large groups."}
{"text":"Love this place! Have been coming here regularly for the past two years and never been disappointed. Lots of food at a great price. I highly recommend the kabobs or any salad. Soo good! Lots of flavour and very consistent."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've reviewed Green Eggplant and I've been there enough over the past few months to know what I'm saying when I say: if it ain't broke, don't fix it!  I went there for lunch today and had a Swiss cheese and mushroom burger. Hard to mess up, but they did. First of all, the burger didn't have any mushrooms. When we made the server aware, we were brought a plate of obviously tinned or jarred (not fresh) mushrooms. And the meat was so salty!!  Of course the service was fast and friendly, but I won't be heading back any time soon!!"}
{"text":"Third time's a charm!  I've been here three times now and it was the third time that I was totally in love with my meal.  I ordered the portobello burger with sweet potato fries and it was absolutely delicious!     The first time, I ordered the veggie burger and the second time I ordered the Greek salad ... both times, the dishes were okay but they didn't wow me.    The regular fries are also quite tasty too ... they are battered and crispy ... yummy!!!!  I can't even say that the sweet potato fries taste better but maybe they are healthier?!   There can often be a wait for this place ... it gets quite busy.  There is NO air conditioning - at least all the times we've gone there was no air conditioning.  The last time it felt like we were sitting in an oven.    Very kid friendly.  They serve fruity looking alcoholic beverages in humongous fun looking cocktail glasses.  I want one!!!!!  Their complimentary bread comes with three special type dips - not your usual butter ... although they do bring butter out as well.    I typically order my dressing on the side but this last time I went, I forgot ... and I would have to say the house salad is a little over-dressed - in my opinion.  The dressing is a little too sweet - in my opinion.    Service is friendly :)  Love this place!!!! :)"}
{"text":"I have been three times to this place that so many seem to love.  From start to finish, my three visits have always been the same.  Staff is good, friendly and generally smiling, but never anything outstanding (which is fine).  The food is, as is the menu, a complete shit-show of things.  The bread on the table and three dips are wonderful snack while you scour the Mediterranean inspired menu.  Now scour is not a word I use often, but I don't eat at a lot of restaurants with menus resembling novellas.    The menu is ridonkulously big, well actually it's the size and shape of a textbook.  Laminated, spiral bound, pages for salads, sandwiches, starters, pastas, stir fries, entrees, specials...probably a dessert and drink one or two as well.    Well intentioned as it is to try to be all things to all people, the menu lost me, the description of the German influenced schnitzel won me over (no clue how), beating out the Asian stir fry and \"American\" tenderloin salad....in this Mediterranean gem.  Anyways, menu size is a little bit snotty, i should have ordered the Mediterranean meals, obviously, but didn't find that page.  The special, vegan and spicy meals are identified on the menu with the same symbol in different colours, i was challenged to see the colours and I'm not colour blind as far as I know.  We ordered and very quickly my accompanying salad arrived, nice and fresh, followed by the table entrees, all presented in a large plate look, no nouveau cuisine here, a great thing, so size wise we were all happy.   To a person there were no complaints, everything got was hot, cold was cold and everyone's order was as described in the menu (to my original comment, three trips here and other than menu choices all trips same as others).  But that's really all it does, the food resembles the description we read, but that's really all it does.  I don't want to sell them short, the food isn't bland, but it is always just \"okay\", a salad which is good, a chicken that is decent, a pasta that is lacking flavour.  I don't doubt that they are trying to please, my feeling is trying to please everyone takes the focus off what they do best, the Mediterranean food.   Running a business in the Beach is brutally challenging, so prices are going to be typically high, but we go out for meals knowing this.  Our only want is give us something for our buck.  Green Eggplant has always delivered, for me at least, food that is just \"okay\", service that equals the food, in an environment that mirrors the average family restaurant.  For me, that's worth an average review."}
{"text":"This has gotta be my favourite restaurant in Toronto by far. They have the biggest long island iced teas I've ever seen and they're super tasty. The Bellini's there are also brilliant. The food is fantastic! The portions are generous and they have a great selection of options on the menu.The fries are always perfectly crispy and service is superb. I no longer live close to the beaches but try to make the trek there as often as I can just to dine at this fine establishment. Keep up the good work Green Eggplant :)"}
{"text":"The eggplant has been in the hood for a while now.  We used to go a lot but now go only occasionally.  The food is good and the portions are big. But the eggplant's menu has not changed, creating a culinary boredom with the fare offered. A seasonal menu or specials would be nice. The biggest problem with the eggplant is the noise level.  Lack of soft surfaces to absorb sound, the noise becomes unbearable at times and when one is going out one wants to enjoy there meal and not cringe at the wails coming from someone else's demon seed three tables over.  You want to go out and dine, leave the kinder at home.   *************************** CLOSED ITS DOORS ************************************"}
{"text":"We go to the Green Eggplant again and again, with friends, with family, with business acquaintances.  It's our neighbourhood go-to place.    All the food is good and the service is fun.  The portions are actually too big on many of the menu items, I don't think my wife has ever finished anything but a breakfast there.    I do love the place, but a couple of warnings.  The place is loud, as in fun, lively bustling.  If you are looking for a quiet candlelit meal with your new special someone, this might not be the place.  Second, as a result of its spectacular success, there is often a lineup.  Friday and Saturday nights (and other nights in nice weather) you should expect a bit of a wait.  It usually doesn't stop us, but once in a while we don't have the time."}
{"text":"Nice dinner spot. As with previous reviews, portions are large -- all three of us each ended up with doggy bags from the two kinds of angel hair pasta and the broiled trout with salad that we each ordered. Good house salad dressing.   Three yummy dips (hummus, tsatziki, and eggplant--though this wasn't green) served with bread almost as soon as we were seated.   Service was quick -- albeit a bit too fast as we weren't even through eating our salads when the mains came along. Just tough to fit on the table and had to scramble a bunch of plates that were already there. I'm glad we skipped appies. We were too full for dessert but I'll surely go back to Green Eggplant next time I'm at The Beach area."}
{"text":"Long wait but worth it.  Serve you bread with 3 dipping. So good. Super generous portions.  I got the Chicken Shishkabobs with the upgraded Sweet Potatoe fries. Way worth it. You also get house salad or Caesar salad with the meal.  Came with 2 huge skewers.  My friend ordered the mushroom pasta and it was huge as well. Server was nice and attentive.  Came to refill our water a few times."}
{"text":"I like their food, and the staff is great. But if I can give some criticism, I can't stand the noise!! Every time I go in for lunch, the music is so loud. It's not too invasive when soft guitar music is playing, but the majority is music meant for night lounges and sometimes it's flat out party music. I'm not an old fuddy duddy, I'm young 30's... but when I go out to lunch with a book I'd like to be able to read it without rave music above my head. When I'm with friends you have to talk loud to have a conversation, and so does everyone else around you.  If you sit near the front, the combination of music and insanely loud kitchen is unbearable, almost leaves me craving the quiet of the street outside. I asked the server why it was so loud, at 1pm, with no one in there, and he said that's how the owner likes it."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Very friendly and very flexible service.  Came here for lunch and ordered lunch special. The meal was very tasty and arrives fast. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner.   Pros  - Portions are HUGE! (I'm not even kidding, the paella was literally served in a frying pan. It was at least 3 portions.) All of their mains can easily be shared.  - Price is good (given the large portions)  Restaurant is clean and looks like slightly high end American diner.   Cons  - service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"I liked the old location better but this is still one of my favourite places to eat in the Beach. Friendly service. Sometimes a short wait for a table. Generous portions,  innovative dishes with lots of flavour. Nice."}
{"text":"this place is my favourite restaurant in the $$ category. Huge portions and great food, atmosphere, everything   nothing but good things to say about this. you must try it out yourself"}
{"text":"New location is open! :) for all those green eggplant lovers like myself I know this is exciting news! It's a bigger space and location is nicer since if you sit at the front it's right in front of the kew park. Pricing is pretty fair, perfect  for a nice brunch or dinner out and the portions are still huge so you will without a doubt get a good bang for your buck. Service is fast and friendly and I find everyone there is conversational and kind. We came to celebrate an occasion and were not disappointed! All news were made fresh and had wonderful flavour.. Always a key spot to hit when in beaches. Worth the trip every time."}
{"text":"The green eggplant is definitely. a gem of the beaches. The portions are huge and it has a very warm atmosphere. The brunch is amazing with many different options. It can get quite busy in morning brunch hours.  So u may have a wait but it definitely is worth it. There is a variety of salads with good portions of meat on them and a delicious salad delicious for a topping . Every ingredient is fresh making a satisfying eating experience."}
{"text":"Wir waren heut auf Empfehlung unserer Gastgeberin im Green Eggplant. Zunächst hieß es: Line up, denn der Laden war brechend voll. Viele Einheimische hier, ist ja wohl ein gutes Zeichen. Nach etwa 20 Minuten hatten wir dann unseren Tisch, eine akzeptable Wartezeit.  Das zuvor servierte Brot mit 3 Dips war köstlich und half über den ersten Hunger hinweg. Service: Professionell und aufmerksam. Hauptspeisen sind gut bemessen, hier geht niemand hungrig heim. Wir hatten Lachs auf dem Brett mit mashed potaetos und auf den Punkt gegrilltes Gemüse.  Der Chardonnay war lecker und gut gekühlt. Ich hatte hiermit echt nichts zu bemängeln, Auch Preis-Leistung passt. Ein sympathisches Restaurant eben, ohne den ganz großen Flair aber dafür ehrlich, bodenständig und kulinarisch mit dem Gewissen Etwas. Käme gern wieder, muss aber leider bald nach Deutschland zurück."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years, since they were at their old location, mostly because the food is good and portions are large. Went for my sisters birthday last week. About halfway through the meal a large party of about 8 were seated directly beside us. They were very loud and disruptive, talking over each other and borderline yelling in the restaurant. I have been to quieter bars. When it got to the point where I could not hear myself think, I let our waiter know that the noise was very disturbing. He said that unfortunately there was nothing he could do. So we rushed through the last half of our meal, skipped the birthday cake for my sister and left. I likely wont be back as the atmosphere is unpredictable and staff are not empowered to deal with bad behavior by other guests. Note: There were 2 other large parties in the restaurant at the time (between 10-15 people) and they were fine. So could be hit and miss but disappointed in the staff's inability to address behavior that was clearly out of line and disruptive to others."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and the food was really good. The waiter was super friendly and we had a really good time.  The portions are huge and priced really well. My friend had lamb and shrimp. He really enjoyed his dish.  I had the salmon and was surprised at how big the fillet was. I could not finish my entree and I was pretty hungry when we arrived.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant.  I also appreciate how they were able to accommodate my lactose and gluten free diet."}
{"text":"The Green Eggplant is our go-to restaurant that always seems to please everyone. They have a very good selection and offer gluten free and vegan options. I often have one of the delicious salmon dishes. I have tried most of the salads - all yummy and LARGE! In fact most portions are large, even the appetizers.  The servers are helpful with ordering appropriate amounts. They also serve bread (even gluten free if you ask) and hummus, artichoke and eggplant spread while waiting for your meal. It's easy to fill up on this and they will bring you more if you ask, so consider this when ordering. I have noticed much of the same staff there since I have been going there over the last 2 years. They seem to recognize us and make us feel welcome, and this is consistent with all the guests that come in.  Be prepared to wait. This is a popular place and is busy for weekend brunch  and often at dinner."}
{"text":"Not bad. Just had their portobello vegetarian garden burger. Delicious and filling, portion sizes are more than fair. Staff are friendly and even though the restaurant was fairly busy, we got served pretty quick. Nice atmosphere. If I am in the neighborhood again I would stop by. Nice!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch over the weekend and left so stuffed! I don't know why this place hasn't received more stars, both my friend and I really enjoyed our meal. The service was pretty good, our waitress brought us water with our coffee without having to ask. We did have a wait a while after our meal for the cheque and for change. Their brunch menu is quite limited, with a selection of weekend specials. We both ordered the lobster spinach Benedict from the weekend list. It came on a big slice of bread which was unique, paired with some potato hash browns and a fruit skewer. I found my eggs to be poached perfectly but noticed one of his was way over cooked. Otherwise, a great meal. :)"}
{"text":"They have awesome dips! The portions are really big.  Service is ALWAYS amazing. The BEST eggs benny in the beaches! And I love the fact that they ask you EXACTLY how you like your eggs done."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today with a client and had the worst ssteak sandwich of my life. It was served nearly cold and everything lacked any sort of pleasing flavour. Will not return - recommend you search elsewhere for a positive lunchtime experience."}
{"text":"A great family-pleaser, the Green Eggplant serves up good food in a casual-chic environment.  It's no surprise that the chef started at the Pickle Barrel - the menu is mostly standards done well.  The prices are fine, and service is good.    Note; it does get insanely busy on weekends, so reserve or be prepared to wait, but it's still a great place to do brunch or lunch.  It tends to be noisy when full."}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST IN TORONTO.   I had the Eggs Benedict with smoke salmon, and they made my poached eggs and Hollandaise sauce prefectly!!  I'll go again for sure !!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Portion size is amazing and price is great! Staff know the menu well and give great recommendations, today was my 5th time there and when ever I return I wonder why I do not come more often!!  If you are in the beaches and are hungry this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"This great little place on the Beaches area strip of Queen West is okay. I wouldn't say this is Mediterranean food, per say. It's some where between \"American (New)\" / Bistro Style. i.e what you could get at any Milestones etc chain restaurant. As a preface for this review, I tend to only like things that have a certain character, and gives me a reason to reach into my wallet and sit and wait for food (otherwise, I can do this all myself!)  Their menu has a lot, including brunch that is served everyday until 3pm. There's a huge choice in Salads, Burgers, Sandwiches and Pastas, but nothing that really caught my eye as special.  Sandwiches looked good, except most of them had chicken breast as the main filler (and I hate chicken's breasts)  I ended up going with the Portabello Mushroom burger. So disappointed that when I got it, it was a wonderbread bun that wasn't even toasted, and cold! Except for the mushroom. The Caesar salad was standard, but who knows what types of crappy (i.e. artificial) ingredients I was eating.   As a starter, they did give us some bread with some tasty namesake dipping sauce. I would say these eggplant dips (including baba) was the only Mediterranean thing about the place.   I find it a bit overpriced. $15 for my Mushroom Burger on a cold bun?! The portion size for the salad was filling, but I also hate not being able to finish my food. I would MUCH rather go to Burger's Priest and get a good tasting expensive burger for half that price.   The service was decent and friendly. Met expectations.   I also noticed on the menu that for a large Fiji water $6.49 for a bottle. WHAT! Who eats here?  However, the decor is very nice and classy. This would be suitable for a lunch meal with your manager (which it was) or taking clients out or something like that.  Or a good alternative to pub food, but price is steep. I do think that there are much better options locally, which are more unique."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and there's really nowhere else you can find portions like Green Eggplant. We literally usually order one less meal than the # of people we have because from experience, we have too much food leftover otherwise. The three spreads that come with the bread are pretty good and hard not to fill up on before your meal arrives.  I've tried the seafood pasta and the steak salad. Again, portions are quite large and flavours are good."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Just went there after a night in Toronto ... awesome food and service"}
{"text":"What a great place!   Food: Lots of choices and fresh, tasty and cheap! I had the Mediterranean Salmon (cooked with pesto and feta). Other people in the group had paella, chicken kebabs, burgers....everything looked amazing. Bread and dips as a complementary appetizer, salads (included in your meal price), then your meal. I was drinking diet coke (free refills) and my meal was about $22 including tax and a decent tip. Tried the paella my friend ordered and it was good.   Decor/Atmosphere: Clean, casual, warm, welcoming and relaxed...perfect. Not too noisey, just perfect!  Staff: Staff are friendly and give great customer service. The waitress came outside just to update us on when we would get a table...we had a 15 minute wait, if that. Our server was attentive and on the ball.   I cannot wait to go back again, definitely a fantastic eatery in the mighty beaches!"}
{"text":"Crowded. Loud. Food wasn't bad really, but some of the servers were inattentive and rude."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place, a lot more spacious than it looks from the outside. Came here with my boyfriend for lunch; he had an item off the all day brunch menu while I had a grilled vegetable chicken salad and a peach bellini. Everything was fresh and the service was above and beyond :)"}
{"text":"My friends and I had a pretty unsavoury experience here a while back (I just started writing Yelp reviews). I planned a night out with some friends that I hadn't seen in a while and suggested that we go to Green Eggplant. We made a reservation for 8 people for 7:00pm. I work in the restaurant industry and understand that things happen and people are sometimes late. In our case, we just wanted to get the entire group together before we sat down. All 8 of us arrived just before 7:15pm (let's say we arrived at 7:12pm, for argument's sake). To be fair to them, we were told about the 15 minute grace period for our reservation. However, we were literally right behind the people who they gave our table to. We watched as the hostess brought those people to what should have been our table. This is a bad business practice and I can only imagine how many other people Green Eggplant have upset over this. I gave them my number when I placed our reservation and a quick call would have revealed that we were in the restaurant when our table was being given away. I get that this can't be done for all reservations if it's busy, but surely they can make an exception for larger parties.  My fiance was outraged because we planned a night with our friends and we felt responsible for not having a table or a place to eat. He went up to the manager and expressed his displeasure and was pretty much told \"you were late, tough luck.\" No rain check, no apology, nothing.   My fiance and I have been to Green Eggplant once since and we will never go again. I ordered the chicken schnitzel with fries. The chicken was dry and the fries are McCain's frozen fries. I know this because I worked at a restaurant that sells the exact fries. Points for being a large portion, but that's the only positive about the dish. My fiance ordered a salmon dish that was swimming in cream sauce. He thought it was alright, but it wasn't what he was expecting.   I don't really understand the hype about this place, but I have a feeling that they're going to have some pretty tough competition soon. The Beaches is starting to get a lot of cool places to eat and I'm willing to bet that these places will have much better customer service."}
{"text":"When I first moved into the area, I tested many of the restaurants on Queen looking for at least one that I wouldn't feel embarrassed bringing out of town guests to in a pinch. I would walk by Green Eggplant and was fascinated by how busy it always was, but I was looking for something a little more exotic.   Since then, I've eaten there at least half a dozen times and the food is reliable, standard flavours, fresh. Overall a safe bet in the realm of lacklustre restaurants in the Beach, especially for people that like basic food without too many surprises."}
{"text":"I go to Green Eggplant almost every Sunday with a group of between 5-8 people usually.  We are always greeted warmly and the service is great every time.  It's always super busy, but we never have to wait more than 30 mins or so and if you call in advance they are pretty accurate with the wait time estimatations.  The food is amazing.  I highly recommend the Mediterranian Grilled Vegetable Chicken Salad, although I've tried several other things on the menu also - everything I try is excellent."}
{"text":"You can't really go wrong with the Eggplant.  Service is important when it comes to the dining experience and they have you covered.  As for the menu it's pretty ecclectic and with a number of real good safe bets.  They say it's fare is Mediterranean but there are offerings of trout to awesome burgers and salads always come with your mains.    Great for kids too.  I take my family of three there at least once a month."}
{"text":"There's a reason this place has a consistent line up out the door.   Amazing food at such a reasonable price. The decor and atmosphere is lovely and the staff are always pleasant. The complimentary breads and dip are unbelievable. I struggle trying not to fill up on those. The filet mignon salad is to die for -- perfectly cooked steak every time. The schnitzel is the size of your head; anybody who can finish it in one go deserves a freaking medal.  No wonder Green Eggplant has grown into such a renowned Beaches institution!"}
{"text":"I wasn't going to leave another review for this place but I decided to because our waiter is really rude. He took forever to come take our order and when he finally did he grabbed the menu out of my hand when I was done and never even asked if we wanted drinks, I had to ask myself. When we were served our dinner there was no \"enjoy your meal,\" nada. He never even checked up on us.   Anyways about the food, I had the Spanish paella which was to die for! Really amazing! And my boyfriend had the beef fillet mignon on a shish-kabob which he thought was mediocre. The waiter didn't even ask how my boyfriend wanted his meat cooked smh. The Cesar salad kind of sucks to be honest. They use parmigiana cheese instead of real cheese on it #fail.   It's really unfortunate that really crappy service resulted in me rating this place only 3 stars because I actually really loved my food. If our waiter was actually nice and a hostess greeted us, I would've given at least 4 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"Whenever I would pass this restaurant, it always appeared busy and packed. A good sign of an amazing restaurant. I put it on my MUST TRY list.   Well I tried and let me tell you, awesome! We arrived close 12:30 on Sunday, so prime brunch time. It was busy when we walked in, we had to wait about 5 minutes for a seat.  The restaurant itself is fairly small, probably close to 50 tables(?). The menu is pretty extensive, from Breakfast fare, to sandwiches, burgers, pasta etc.   I ordered the veggies burger, which was absolutely insanely good. The fries were nice, light and crispy to the bite!  My foodie mate ordered the portabello burger (it had a portabello mushroom and some grilled veggies, and goat cheese). He said it was good too.   Before our meal we were given a basket of bread and 3 types of dips. One was an eggplant one, the second hummus and the third, equally delish, not sure what it was.. It was a creamy based dip..   Each burger meal comes with a salad - either house or caesar. I ordered a greek salad for $1 more.  It was one of the best, maybe even the best greek salad I've ever had, the dressing had a sweetness to it.. mmmmmmm....   My meal ended up costing $12 before tax and tip, which is pretty good for lunch! I had a good size doggie bag which I ate later that day. I love this restaurant..."}
{"text":"first time in their new location. didn't like the ambiance, the atmosphere nor the waitress/waiter's attitudes from the beginning to the end.  No one seems to care anymore. no smile, no follow up after the food is served, nothing.   The chicken shish Kabob with house salad and mash potato arrived WITHOUT the mash potato!! When we asked why, the server said \"we ran out of potato\" although he himself offered the mash potato!  Oh ya, the chicken was almost white and had no color on it!   We also asked for another basket of bread as the first one was not fresh nor hot. Took them 15 minutes to bring us another basket and no usual complimentary sauce plate.    The joint is just not the same as couple of years ago.  Won't go there again."}
{"text":"Nice vibe, nice restaurant, friendly service, GOOD FOOD, reasonable prices.  Just don't order steak sandwich !  :) On Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, show up after 8:30 if you don't like line-ups."}
{"text":"Was at the beaches last week and decided to finally give Green Eggplant a try. I have to say, I really enjoyed my lunch, which was a HUGE grilled chicken salad with vegetables (so filling I couldn't finish!) and my sister got a pasta that was also great.   We ordered a few martinis as well, which tasted excellent and they don't hold back on the vodka!   The service was super fast (almost too fast since they brought our mains while our appetizer wasn't yet finished) but everyone was extremely friendly and attentive for the entire meal.   I loved the the bread and dips they bring when you first sit down, the eggplant dip is incredible! Would definitely recommend. There is also a location uptown on Eglinton between Yonge and Avenue Rd."}
{"text":"Funny.  I gave this review a 4 out of 5 because the food is great but our service today left ALOT to be desired.  We had,  truly, the most miserable waitress I have ever encountered.  Now, I am in the service industry so I will always try and put myself in their shoes...a bad day, a death in the family,  etc but this girl was just bitchy.    I have never seen someone not want to be at their job as much as this girl.    The front staff are very nice and friendly ( I'm sure one of them is the owner) but this particular girl needs to find a job elsewhere.  I will return but make sure I do not have her as my waitress.  If she doesn't quit or get fired by then."}
{"text":"It costs a lot to open a restaurant today and I cannot imagine why anyone goes to that trouble to offer such a bad experience. The service was so bad that it is impossible to rate. In fact, it was non-existent: there was no \"service\" (excessive wait, no offers of a beverage, no meal recommendations and not even the customary inquiry about \"how are things\"). The food ranged from good to very average. The ambiance was a combination of muzak, kitchen sounds, ice being crushed at the bar and children amusing themselves. Harsh lighting, a giant screen TV with news flashes. Most adult patrons looked unengaged. That wasn't the reason we went- we won't be returning."}
{"text":"What a large and bustling community brunch and grill destination within the Beaches! We stopped by today for a very late lunch/very early supper in part because the patio looked so spacious and the name sounded so vegetarian-friendly.  Food- 2/5. No wow factor, especially when it came to the vegetarian options. The only wow factor are the large portion sizes and the copious amount of complimentary bread, which actually tasted good (baguette perhaps?). I didn't like my grilled salmon salad, which I asked for dressing on the side and I'm glad I did because it looked pretty heavy. The veggie part was fine - lots of variety with purple cabbage, carrots, purple onions, canned mandarins, etc in addition to the usual romaine lettuce. The salmon was too oily though and tasted like grease and nothing else. Too bad. The vegetarian portobello mushroom burger was disappointing according to my partner, who claims the veggie burger at The Burger's Priest is sooo much better. His large-cut fries were better though, but nothing amazing. Not too crispy or soggy.  Value- 3/5. Huge portions (especially the salads), but expect to pay at least $15 for mains and $10 for appetizers. Our bill for 2 mains came out to $42 pre-tip.  Service- 3/5. Slow and not very attentive since our water glasses stayed dry until the very end of the meal. But the place had friendly staff and a welcoming, laid-back community atmosphere.  Venue- 4/5. Wonderfully large patio and large inside space. Perfect for groups.  Probably won't be back since there are so many other promising grub hubs in the area."}
{"text":"Very good food , the service not so.....amazing . The waiters are tired sweaty with dirty clothes. No problem to broom under she tables when you are having your meal. I am not sure how they get 2013 best restaurant with Urban spoon? !"}
{"text":"This is a nice reliable neighbourhood restaurant with very large portions and fast friendly service.  We've eaten here dozens of times and the ambiance is cosy.  Wide range of casual dishes and the complimentary trio of dips at the start of the meal is a nice touch. Their kitchen adds new items to the menu on a semi-regular basis.    Our only suggestion for the kitchen:  please consider using a bit less garlic in the mains, or provide more no-garlic options. Example: in all the items that contain chicken breast, the chicken is overpoweringly garlicky, which isn't necessary as the rest of the ingredients are always so nice and fresh.  (I know this is technically a Mediterranean spot) Thanks, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place was really good...I came here today just after 12PM, first meal of the day for me.  Really cute and busy inside, but there was hardly a wait. They serve bread with three type of dip (free!), hummous, a really delish tomato-y eggplant dip and a garlicy mayo dip.   I ordered a portobello mushroom burger (all veggies...grilled veg with fried onions!) and it came with this amazing garlicy sauce. And fries with salad! Can you imagine? If you went to Earls, or Milestones or one of these other places, they'd force you to pay an extra amount for fries and salad together. But this place ... both come with your meal!  My parents shared a \"fish and chips\".... a grilled snapper, the full sucker on a hot iron plate and subbed yam fries (an extra $1.25) and my fiance ordered an avocado chicken sandwich with Hooegarden (sp?).  My burger was AMAZING. I will be back here again for the burger. It was all veggie, but tasted like it was one of those delicious bad-for-you burgers. And OMFG - the yam fries. Thin but sweet and freshly fried and served with the chipotle mayo.  Love this place. You will too."}
{"text":"So, last Friday my fridge decided to call it quits.  We're currently unable to bring food into the house and expect it to last any length of time, so we've been going to McDonald's and the like to try and stay fed.  Last night we thought, \"You know what?  Let's try somewhere new.  Maybe somewhere in the beaches.\"  So, after extensive Yelping, the Green Eggplant had my vote.  And needless to say, I was not dissapointed.  The cost of soda here is just like at any restaurant.  $2.50 free refills.  The menu was absolutely ridiculous.  I mean, there was at least a 5 page menu, and I wasn't expecting it at all.  We ordered the \"Mediterranean Sausage Penne Pasta\" and the \"Lobster & Jumbo Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta in a Rosee sauce\" (just because I'm not a fan of the creamy sauce).  As well as the \"Jumbo Rock Slide Brownie Sundae\".   We  walked in around 4:00, dead empty.  We got seated right away, water was brought to the table immediately along with some delicious bread and dips.  The three dips were a (pardon my spelling) babaganoush, roasted eggplant, and hummus.  I already know I don't like hummus so I just avoided that one, the eggplant was interesting, but I don't think my tastebuds are that sofisticated yet.  The babaganoush was GONE.  Both my boyfriend and I loved it.  Amazing.  Our water cups were filled every few minutes, so no complaints there.  We also got another order of bread almost immediately. So, the sausage dish.  The sausage was a little on the salty side, and if you're not the one who ordered it, it's just right.  But I can see how if you had to eat a plate full of it, it would become a little too salty.  The sauce.  I'm not sure what to say about it.  When you look at it, you almost expect a regular tomato sauce, but when you actually taste it it's something else altogether.  Delicious in it's own right, but definitely throws you off for a minute or two. The Lobster and Jumbo shrimp, well, that was just okay.  In all honesty I couldn't even find a piece of lobster, and based on the huge chunks of shrimp, I kind of expected to see a lobster tail sitting on my pasta that I'd have to cut up, but no such luck.  I was not a fan of the rosee sauce, but like I said before, I've never been a fan of creamy sauces.  For those that don't know, the rosee is just the creamy white sauce mixed with some tomato sauce.  I think I would have perferred this dish more if it were larger chunks of lobster, the impossibly small shrimp, and tomato sauce. The brownie sunday, Oh My God.  I was expecting a little plate of goodness, but when this came out, it was MASSIVE.  At least 1cup of ice cream, 1cup of whipped cream, three brownie chunks, a cherry on top, and pure goodness.  The whipped cream, ice cream, cherry and chocolate sauce are your standard staples.  The brownie was this peanut butter, chocolate chunk brownie.  Not expected but delicious. Part way through our meal a few more tables were seated, and it seemed like there was only the one waitress working, so we got \"forgotten\" for a few moments here and there, but if you're in a busy restaurant, you'd expect that to happen a couple times.  Not enough to make me complain. All in all, it was absolutely delicious, the plate sizes were HUGE, and both of us had something to take home (although we couldn't due to the fridge), it was more like two days eating out at the same place, ordering the same meal.  That's how much was left over.  We ended up spending $48 including tip.  Will definitely return to try something else. I don't ever give 100% (five stars) because I don't believe it exists.  But if it did, this place would certainly be close.  Oh and they have a website if you want to check out the menu before you go, http://www.greeneggplant.com/index.html"}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood restaurant! The menu has something for everyone: you can find sandwiches or full meals, and it's all very tasty. The restaurant itself has a very friendly vibe and is a neighbourhood go-to place for any occasion."}
{"text":"This should read 4.5 stars.  We were headed somewhere else for brunch only to find them closed on Mondays. Vexed, we walked the Beach looking for options. We settled on the Green Eggplant, and it was good fortune we did.  The place is nice and clean and the decor is really muted. Looked like it split the difference between approachable and upscale. A nice place, for sure.  I had the New York Steak and Eggs, and my wife enjoyed the Mediterranean Breakfast. She said her scrambled eggs were ever so slightly overdone, but sang the praises of the hummus, feta, and mostly the cream cheese. Very fresh and vibrant flavors.  I have had many breakfast steaks and one of the themes of restaurants cooking small steaks is overlooking them. I asked for medium, and to my great pleasure, it was cooked perfectly. The potato cakes were crispy, tasty and basically awesome as well. My over easy eggs were also good, and we both enjoyed the side salad, which was dressed perfectly and tastily.  This is a great place for breakfast. Good price, too. Service isn't fast, but not slow. Pleasant, I suppose. We would eat here again, for sure."}
{"text":"Great food and for the prices you definitely get a bang for the buck feel.  Only complaint would be when I was there last time with my GF the boss or owner of the place was losing it on his employees in front of the whole dinner area. It was very unprofessional and made us feel uncomfortable.   Food is great though! will be going back."}
{"text":"Tasty, overly generous portions delivered quickly to the table. The house salad had a lovely light dressing. Noisy and bright ... Not the place for romance but works for a family meal. The Mediterranean salad is a favorite and if you need a boost or iron, the filet mignonette is a tasty add-on."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place is so busy. The menu selection is mediocre and so is the food.  Portion size is good, and Service is good.  But taste is bland."}
{"text":"A few of my friends that live in the beaches all recommended the Green Eggplant so it was necessary to give this place a shot. Thankfully we came about 30 min before their kitchen was closing however the green eggplant still had a lot of patrons inside.  With the beautiful night we sat by the open glass windows and ordered away.  Along with your order, complimentary bread and three-spread appetizer; hummus, eggplant jam, and mayo while you wait for your meal to arrive.  When it was all said and done, Iriana had the Grilled Chicken Focaccia with cheese, pesto, spinach and cheese.  This dish was disappointing, no cheese? when we took apart the sandwich it was no where to be seen.  The sandwich lacked overall flavor hmmmmm 2/5  I ended up having their Mediterranean burger, juicy, in-house made burger with onions, tomatoes, feta, red peppers..this burger was pure bliss! but hard to bite into due to the size.  The fries were perfect! LIGHTLY salted.  Overall all dishes in my opinion were rated 4/5.  The service was excellent, the ambiance was hipster, yet relaxed, again, its the beaches! i'd like to come back sometime to try something different.  The prices are portions are quite reasonable for the area.... :)    ...........and this restaurant does NOT have ranch sauce ....thank you Iriana!! :p"}
{"text":"Really good service and food! Highly recommended! Recently renovated good management!"}
{"text":"This place is easily one of the best restaurants in the Beach. It's not gourmet, but the food is excellent and consistent! It's versatile atmosphere and menu are suitable for any group or occasion. Value is also excellent for what you get; large portions, and tasty bread & dips while you wait! There is a reason why this place has survived and thrived! Wish there was more space, and lack of reservations makes waiting a pain at times. But I do wait, and there's a reason for that: because it's worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service.  We had the house soup. It was the best soup i ever had.      Would definitely come again"}
{"text":"I have be here many times but my most recent experience has left me disappointed. Clearly they were short staffed the day we went. We waited 10 minutes before even being greeted by the server, in which he tossed a basket of bread on the table and walked away. He came back and asked \"are you ready\"? We put in our orders and it was another 25 minutes before We got our drinks. So We sat thirsty for 35 minutes. When the meal came 5 minutes later I found it tough to drink such a massive frozen drink with my meal, I would have preferred to sit and drink while waiting for my food, instead of  trying to slurp down a massive icey drink with food. The server was very busy, I didn't see more than 3-4 servers and it was packed, that's not enough staff for a big busy restaurant. The food was good so I struggled between a 3-4 rating but my rating reflects the lack of staff and service."}
{"text":"Having been here before, my friends and I decided to come again for some lunch. I ordered the steak sandwich with sweet potato fries (extra charge for the fries). The sandwich itself wasn't terrible... but it could've been better. The bread was very dry and I regret not asking them to cook the steak to medium-rare or well-done. Instead, I asked for just medium and found the steak really hard to bite and chew.   I wasn't able to finish my food so I took the leftovers home but unfortunately when they packed up my fries they didn't pack up the chipotle dip so I was stuck with dry soggy fries. :( Next time I'll be asking them to pack up the sauce too."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of both dinning in and also using their services through Uber Eats. This is a place that has a great name and solid food. Nothing crazy delicious, but in general okay Mediterranean eats. Wait times are long on the weekends, so that has deterred me from eating there too often.   My issue is with their adoption of Uber Eats to their business model and lack of understanding that UTENSILS are common practice in the delivery world,  and an expectation that a delivery customer has when ordering take out. Speaking to Serge the owner on the phone (yup I called back and checked) he has zero understanding, and couldn't understand my expectation of the inclusion of utensils with my order. Yes, this is a very first world problem, but Yelp is designed for dealing with these first world problems. Perhaps if Serge, understood that my take out experience was an extension of his \"in house\" experience, he might have been apologetic and a tad empathetic to the fact that I had no way of eating with $15 salad without a fork, and the responsibility of common sense should have been on the establishment not its customer. However, as Serge explained to me on the phone I should have known that my salad didn't come with a fork, I should know better and should have requested it."}
{"text":"I have been here only once but I fell in love with the place. The menu is absolutely fantastic. It has a variety of healthy and home cooking meals (exactly what I love). Great for brunch and lunch."}
{"text":"Great spot. My friend and I enjoyed lunch yesterday.  We lucked out  and were taken to a table right away usually there is a line up. I ordered the breakfast and i was a large portion, delicious and came with a skewer of fresh fruit.  This was our first visit , we will be back our waiter Raymond was very pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"This would receive a four star if the service was a little better.     The menu has some hidden treasures.  Surprisingly, the Burger is excellent.   Given the name, you'd think the salads were the best."}
{"text":"Great food, and an amazingly wide variety of options.  I usually worry about quality when a restaurant serves every type of food under the sun- but so far it has all been great at the Green Eggplant.  Only thing that keeps me from going for 5 stars is service.  A couple of times it has been wonderful, and a couple of times we had a server who seemed to feel that we should eat elsewhere!"}
{"text":"We were walking on Queen street in the beaches and decided to try the Green Eggplant on a whim. This was a good decision. The restaurant is warm and inviting, busy and loud. Before you order they brought us a small plate of hummus, fried eggplant and bubaganoosh with French bread. The goulash was great for a cold Jan day on Toronto. The meat in the soup was super tender, they must use filet. We also shared a trout salad and the fish was cooked perfectly and the vinaigrette was just right not too tart and not too sweet. The service from Maya was great, the restaurant was really busy, full, and we still received attentive and personal service."}
{"text":"I have had 2 amazing experiences here. My fam and I strolled in at about 3:30pm while walking along the Beach strip. We had unfortunately come too late for any of the brunch specials but the restaurant looked nice and busy so we ventured inside.  We were seated pretty quickly and the wait staff was very friendly, bringing us ice water immediately. Not too long after we were all surprised by a delicious offering of 3 complimentary dips. The Babaganouj was addictive, the red eggplant dip was also delectable, and even the humus (which I'm not usually privy too, had a great taste and creamy texture). Needless to say we quickly finished the dips with our baguette bread. Now to the menu.  The food was all described well and was priced well for a trendy restaurant. Entrees ran generally  between $11-20 but they were all worth every penny. The chicken salads were awesome (grilled veggie one and also the luau Asain styled one). Also the paninis were presented in 3 delectable sandwiches on a long plate. All styled gourmet. To both my shock and amazment, once the waiter had noticed our dip plate was finished, he brought out ANOTHER.   Anyways, great experience here. Amazing food in a lovely location is a nice weekend brunch treat and I highly recommend the experience.  I am willing to try the Eglinton location...anyone have reviews on that one?"}
{"text":"On my second visit to the Green Eggplant on Queen East I wasn't disappointed by this eatery. I went for dinner with a group of nine people. We'd made a reservation and the table was ready for us when we arrived. The wait staff was attentive and courteous. The reason I want to keep coming back here, though, is the great food! Everyone was happy with their meal--the pasta and fish were popular options. Also, the feta burger was a big hit. The portions are large, so come with a big appetite or be willing to take away. Not always a bad thing. Two people in my party had the banana split for dessert--a truly awesome structure to behold!--but I was too stuffed from my Rosee Penne to eat another bite."}
{"text":"Large portions are probably the best feature of this restaurant.  They are LARGE! You've been warned. The quality of the ingredients is middle-of-the-road if you've eaten at places like Canoe.  The service is somewhat rushed, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Prices are bit higher than the average, but given the portions they are a bargain.  I had the chicken vegetable stir fry and was pretty good, though the chicken was obviously pre-frozen/not fresh.  The ambience is nice, renovated, new furniture, clean and fresh."}
{"text":"Kimmie, Mike, Juliana, etc etc and myself are not wrong. Go to the Green Eggplant. My wife and I were at Front and York and instead of looking for a spot to nosh in the core, we hopped in our car and drove to the Beach for dinner at the Green Eggplant. Two dinners, two glasses of decent pinot grigo, (salads come with entrees), for $62 tip included.  I always order the chicken schnitzel. Amazing and wow begin to describe the flavour of this massive hunk sitting atop not to creamy red mashed potatoes. Mmmmm. Decent caesar salad with real croutons - the mark of a smart chef. My wife had the rainbow trout (had to take half home). Oodles of flavour, moist and well presented. Superb house salad.  It is a bit noisy but if you like to people watch this is a great spot. The waitresses are super nice and there is a community feel to the place.  Seriously, check this place out. I would order somehting else off the sizable menu if I could get voice in my head to stop saying, \"Chicken Schnitzel\" over and over again. Thankfully, that's all the voice says...well, not true, it does whisper \"Bacon\" every so often.  Later Gators."}
{"text":"Great food, ambiance and drinks. The daiquiri was large with a fresh strawberry on the rim. The free bread and 3 dips were great. I had the Paella which came with huge tiger shrimps, mussels, chicken and sausage and was very tasty. The sweet potato fries were also excellent."}
{"text":"The common reaction about this place seems to be \"I thought it was Thai\". It was far from it. Mix of Western and cultured food. I had the Mexican Burger and my gf had the Paella. The burger was good. I hope it was smokier than advertised. Bacon was crunchy and not so salty. The Paella was really good. Very meaty. Lots of chicken, shrimp and mussels.  One of the best Paellas I've had."}
{"text":"Went here after many recommendations from family and friends who had visited here or considered it a local favourite. I was not disappointed!  Went on a Sunday of a long weekend around 7pm and they were steadily busy. Service was fast and drinks were ordered and served within 10 minutes. Extremely friendly service and you can see everyone is working hard but not in a running around way which I find stressful when eating. I ordered the chicken hummus and veggie wrap with sweet potato fries and kept it simple with a bottled beer. The food came hot and in large portions, especially considering the very reasonable price! My order was delicious and tasted fresh and well put together. We were offered desert menus but declined after eating so much, I'm sure they were great though. I would definitely come here again and probably use it as a go to when friends are in the area!"}
{"text":"Once again I have had another wonderful meal at the Green Eggplant.  I Stopped in for brunch last Sunday and had the Eggs Benny. It was great and the eggs were perfectly done. I have had many a hard egg and that is just not a Benny to me.  Loved the mini potato rounds and the dressing on the side salad was very nice."}
{"text":"The chicken avocado grilled sandwich is my favourite here! Their house salad dressing is delicious! Everything about this place is incredible, and it's close to the beach!"}
{"text":"GE is a bustling place in the Beaches. People come for huge martinis, great milkshakes, or a great selection of food. The prices are decent, the portions are large, and the ambience is perfect for a casual night with friends or a large celebration. Green Eggplant looses some stars to the inconsistencies in food and not-as-friendly-as-they-could-be staff. However, the food and the staff definitely earn their 3 stars.  On my first and second visit to GE I ordered one of their delectable Milkshakes. The shake was creamy and large, but the ice-cream they used was low quality and it also showed in the taste. The sweet potatoes fries I ordered were exceptional. Despite the name of the restaurant, the roasted eggplant sandwich was not the highlight of my night. On the second visit, the delicious veggie burger I ordered redeemed itself."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this restaurant.  The staff has always been friendly, the atmosphere is very energetic, and the food it absolutely amazing!  I've had their burgers, salads and sandwiches and have never been disappointed.  The menu may be a bit too big but so far I've enjoyed ordering something new each time.  If I had to pick a personal fave, I'd say the steak salad, but would still want to try something new.  The greatest thing about this restaurant is they are baby friendly.  So many mommies and strollers in here."}
{"text":"We were lured in by the appearance/atmosphere from outside. We expected a nice dining experience. We waited 20 minutes for a table which is usually indicative of a great establishment so we didn't mind. However. It was not all that great. Disappointing, actually.  The food was sub par to say the least. Caesar salad was bland and had no bacon bits. Which is odd since we know they have bacon. It comes on almost every burger.  What were supposed to be medium-rare filet mignon shish kebob were served to me well-done instead and they were very chewy.  The waitress forgot to bring my date's second beer, so when she realized this, she said if he still wants it, she wouldn't charge him for it, so he said okay, then she went ahead and put it on the bill anyway. Also, when she saw how much food we had left on our plates, she laughingly pointed out that the portions are \"crazy big\" here. Well, that would have been nice to know before we ordered, not after we finished eating.  They have an inviting ambience from outside, but it ends there. Just not any better than the next pub."}
{"text":"I love their free bread and hummus, eggplant, baba ganoush dipping sauce!!  I ordered the chicken schnitzel and it comes with house/Caesar salad with a choice of side (fries, mashed potatoes or balsamic rice).  I chose the house salad with dressing on the side.  I think it's balsamic dressing.  The veggies are all diced up so it's easier to eat.  The chicken schnitzel piece is HUGE.  It is a bit too fried though.  The mashed potatoes tasted good."}
{"text":"This gem on Queen St. Is definitely worth a visit.  It is one of the Iconic restaurants in the area.  The decor is upscale, the menu selection is wide, the food is excellent, service friendly, and the prices are fair.  Portion size is large enough to share an entre.  They bring a sliced baguette with three dipping sauces. All were great.  A good place to eat, and watch the Queen st. Traffic."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, huge portions, & great selection of healthy meals. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on a Thursday in the early afternoon and it was very busy. We were seated quickly. The atmosphere was great because the large windows at the front were open. We were given bread with three different types of dips/spreads which was lovely. I ordered the warm luau salad which was disappointing. It was excessively large and had extremely big \"wontons\" buried underneath the salad which just seemed strange to me. I picked them out and didn't eat them. I wish they had just been small like a crouton size so I could have enjoyed them. The chicken was cut very small and spread around the outside of the salad so I found it difficult to find the pieces. The service was fine. I'm not sure that I would return."}
{"text":"I have been back here a bunch of times, and generally have been underwhelmed.  The service has always been quite good, but the food has been okay at best.  Nothing really draws me to come here for dinner anymore.  Actually, my husband and friends went here for dinner last night and were given a free bruschetta on the house.  They brought some back for me and it was nothing exciting (altho a very nice gesture)."}
{"text":"Strike 2 and you are OUT!  I have been a LOYAL customer for many years. I have brought people there and was always one of my \"go to\" places.  A month ago I had friends come up from states and told them we HAD to go to this restaurant. When we got there my friend asked to swap out a \"sundried\" tomato for a plain tomato to which we were told \"no you cannot\" in a very short tone. Sure they were busy but no excuse. Furthermore on that evening we ordered a sweet potato fries and when it didn't arrive we mentioned it again to the waiter. The waiter rolled his eyes in annoyance and didn't return until the end with the plate of fries. We had all finished our meals and were not in need of fries but he still made us buy them even though we had not touched them. The food took forever to come and service was awful! STRIKE 1.   STRIKE 2:   Same friend comes to states and we again convince them to try it. We went for breakfast and in our friends eggs Benny was a long black hair (we are all blonde with short hair). I mention it to the waiter who again was not friendly. We finished our meals and our friends came at the end. She had to scarf down her meal because we were sitting waiting. The bill comes and full price. I mean sure, the hair in the food not a problem, the long wait was annoying but whatever, but no comp is just sad. I asked the waiter who started arguing and getting angry at me. I asked to speak to the manager and he told me he was. I told him how we were disappointed and that we would like a compensation for 11 dollars or lose a long term customer. He got even MORE argumentative including other waiters in the discussion which just humiliated me. I left angry and paying full price.  Summary: food is good and service is terrible. I'd love chef Ramsay to come to this place! Please boycott until things change drastically."}
{"text":"It would be more of a 2-star review but their trio of dips are worth a star on its own. The restaurant looks nicer now after their renovations (or did they move altogether?). The food is decent and they're generous with their portions. This is not my first choice unfortunately but I'd eat there again if I have to."}
{"text":"Lets start with the positives! You get a lot of bang for your buck here.  The portion sizes are really huge here and you get a salad with your entree order.  The bread you get when you arrive and dips are sooo good (eggplant, hummus and baba ghanouj).  The cocktails are really good here too.  Prices are very reasonable (most dishes range from 14-20$).   Now for the places they could improve.. The staff tend to be hit and miss here, I've had some really nice servers and some not so nice that make you feel rushed.  I've tried lots of dishes here from chicken schnitzel, portobello mushroom burger, Thai stir fry etc... And while portion sizes are huge the flavour is lacking.  The food is fine but just not amazing."}
{"text":"First time here, and I must say that this place is going to be our local restaurant.  Great service, free bread with 3 delicious dips!  We just had the salads but they were huge!!!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Discovered this place a year ago and they have been consistent ever since.  The nice thing about this place is they actually feature some healthy dishes which is hard to find in the now touristy Toronto Beaches.  The ambience is nice enough, comfy and casual, kind of Greek restaurant meets Sports Bar.  The hostess and waiters are no nonsense, they get your orders right and are very quick but don't expect tons of smiling and long conversations, this place moves and is often very busy, especially in the summer.  The food is always hot, fresh and delicious.  I highly recommend two of my personal favourites, either the Salmon Salad or the Chicken Shish Kebab (go with house salad, their dressing is really nice).  Of course, if you don't want to go healthy, try the chicken parm.  It's HUGE and smells and looks delicious.  20 years ago, I'd be brave enough to try this one.  All the portions here are BIG, you won't leave hungry.  If anything you'll have leftovers, which will justify their slightly higher than expected prices.  But the prices are justified with the quality of food, service and amount of food you get.  Don't come here for a light snack."}
{"text":"My cousin and I went here for dinner tonight and we were not pleased. Everything was fine until about midway through dinner where a large group of about 8 people came into the restaurant. I believe either these people were family or close friends of the waiter because as soon as they arrived all his attention was on them (I also say this because I saw one them smack the waiters butt?). It took us about 15 minutes before we could get his attention to receive the bill.  I made a comment about how the bill is together and not separate which he then replied with \"I never split the bill unless I am told otherwise\" and the tone of his voice was not pleasent. Since my cousin was paying for the dinner the deal was, that I would pay for the tip. When the waiter finally brought the machine my cousin tipped him $2 using debit (since I would leave a $5 bill on the table) followed by us asking politely for another plastic bag for our to go containers. I then watched the waiter walk around the restaurant to his coworkers and show that he was only tipped $2. By this point I was furious that I put my $5 bill back in my wallet and told my cousin we were leaving. I'm completely flabbergasted by his attitude towards the situation. If he didn't jump to conclusions and had the decency to just grab a plastic bag with no complaints he would be $5 richer."}
{"text":"Definitely enjoyed my brunch here with my friends. Got the green eggplant sunrise breakfast, california smoked salmon benedict and the spanish paella. The breakfast dishes were great and the portions generous. The spanish paella was also really good (having it been my first time trying it). As appetizers, you get unlimited free bread and spreads - my favourite part. And for brunch hours, you can still order anything off their bar menu which made our lunch even more enjoyable. We got the bloody caesar (which I wasn't that big of a fan of), peach bellini (SO good) and a classic margarita. If you like fruity drinks, I'd definitely go for one of their bellinis. The atmosphere was warm, looks small from the outside but quite spacious actually. Be prepared for the menu, it is lengthy with a really good selection so you may need some time to pick (we know we did).   Tips? There's parking down the road from the restaurant and if you sit by the windows, you can see all the cute dogs that pass by! And it's close to the beach!"}
{"text":"I'm still giving this place four stars.  We ate lunch here today and I just wanted to mention that their menu appears to be revamped.    I got the Mexican Smoky Burger.  I almost forgot what it was called and I looked on their website just now and the new items haven't been added.  Anyway, the burger had crispy onion strings (those three words will probably automatically make me order that item), Chipotle mayo, two kinds of cheese and bacon.  I could only eat half.  It came with delicious, golden fries!  Good job, Green Eggplant!"}
{"text":"They have a menu that satisfies a big breakfast, quick lunch or an all-out dinner with big portions, creative plates, indulging both in healthy or upper bar food. What really stands out is the service, value, and drinks. Customers are really accommodated. Their bartending is exceptional with especially with exceptional twists on icy beach drinks."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in the Beaches. Once seated served with 3 dips and bread ( one of which is eggplant)... a lovely touch... Excellent and very filling reasonably priced signature breakfast, including potato pancakes \"like my mother used to make.\" Many other entrees available and would be a great luncheon and dinner place...Jumbo shrimp appetizer with focaccia bread a generous portion. .pretty hostess, good service from our waiter....Loved it and will return..."}
{"text":"the atmosphere, food and service all amazing. they have a very good menu and friendly staff, defiantly recommend the french onion soup and the filet mignon shish kabob this are my 2 top choices but everything on the menu is really good ! they also have a big selection of vegetarian food as well"}
{"text":"Today was my second visit to this restaurant. The first time we went as a group of three for lunch. We got the goat cheese chicken panini with the Caesar salad, the lite choice pork chops and veggies, and the slider trios. Everything was absolutely delicious. Make sure you go here hungry. The portions are huge. Also to start you get a baguette with some dips. The dip trio, hummus, baba ganoush, and eggplant tomato tapenade are out of this world. This morning we went for breakfast. We asked for the bread, and our server said that they didn't normally do it for breakfasts (it was about 11), but she'd get it for us. For breakfast we got the sky high French toast. The best French toast I've ever had, it came with four huge pieces of challa egg bread so crispy, covered in berries and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It had its own mini bottle of maple syrup. If you like French toast you have got to try this."}
{"text":"Second visit tonight, lined up as always so it's got to be good right?  Well, not so much.  We sat for probably 10 minutes before having to ask someone to take our drink order.  Waited another 10 minutes to get the drinks and the bread/dip appetizer.  Asian chicken stir fry was ok (husband) my food never arrived...finally made eye contact with waiter who apologized but seemed bewildered that my meal never arrived.  Kids pasta had way too much butter on it.  I'll spend my $$ elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"This place was built up to me.. and boy did it not disappoint!   They have a huge menu, which includes soups, salads, and sandwiches, as well as main course type dishes - absolutely perfect for lunch!   As soon as we sat down, we had pitas and three dips brought over, including hummus, and two others (not sure what they were, but delicious!) they were good enough to have been an appetizer on the menu, so they were a definite bonus. We also had the beef goulash to start, which though slightly oily, was full of flavor, and a huge portion.   For the main, I had the Asian Chicken Salad, which was delicious but could not compare to the sandwich combo some others got. They had the Avocado Club, which had a whole avocado on it! This comes not only with fries (we subbed for sweet potato fries) but also a salad - after that we realized the soup was definitely not needed. Everything was fresh and perfect.  Not only was the food AH-MAZING but the prices were right for the portions and quality, and the service was spot-on. I could see this being a weekly occurrence for me if I lived in the area, but I will definitely be back as often as I can!"}
{"text":"I went there with a friend for the first time last night and I had the Mediterranean chicken salad and it was delish! The portions are huge and the prices are fair. The place was packed for a Tuesday, which was a good sign! I loved it so much that I plan to go back there tomorrow and taking two more friends."}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars. I'm rounding up.    I grew up in the Beaches. I can't call it the Beach.   In high school, I met a female student in French class in grade nine. I had skipped a grade in French. We ended up in French class together for three years and struck up a friendship.  Last year, we met up for the first time in twenty years. Yikes! She now lives in Victoria. On a good note, we both said that we look exactly the same. It didn't feel like any time had elapsed.   She recently came back for her niece's wedding. She asked if we could get together. I was game. We tend to choose a place in our old neighbourhood.  I chose Green Eggplant. She was good with it. I had visited this restaurant when it was further west along Queen Street East, next to the first Licks location. I remember liking what I had eaten there.   Parking gets more challenging when I visit the old 'hood. I couldn't find any street parking. Instead, I splurged and found a parking spot at the Green P lot on Lee. $4 from 6 pm for twelve hours is decent. My timing was impeccable, as someone had just pulled out of a spot. So, in my car went!  I made it to the restaurant at exactly 6:30 pm. I was greeted promptly, and was asked whether I wanted a table closer to the front or back. I asked what the difference was. It was apparently warmer at the back.   I sat next to a cozy fireplace. Moments later, my friend came in. It was great seeing her.   We stayed at the restaurant for over three hours. We had the following items:  - Hummus, baba ghanoush, and bread - Mediterranean mint tea - Side salad with garlic vinaigrette - Lobster tiger shrimp angel hair pasta  The starter hummus, baba ghanoush, and bread were free. Nice touch! All of it was delicious.   I went with Mediterranean mint tea. It was so good! It was both fragrant and refreshing.  We both opted for the lobster tiger shrimp angel hair pasta. It came with a side salad. This side salad was enormous. It could have been easily an entree. The garlicky vinaigrette was amazing.   The main dish was a bit disappointing. The flavours were good, as were the shrimp and lobster. The noodles were overdone. I didn't have to chew much.   This restaurant closes at 9:30 pm on a Wednesday night. It was a bit earlier than I had imagined, but the staff there told us to take our time.   We visited the washroom before leaving. The older stores in this neighbourhood are deep and the washrooms are downstairs. The women's washroom was clean and roomy.   We walked upstairs. Staff wished us a great evening and we reciprocated.   I'd come back here to try more items on the menu. I just won't order this angel hair pasta dish.   (262)"}
{"text":"This is just my second review on Yelp and I can honestly say Green Eggplant is one if my favourite restaurants in Toronto. On busy weekdays I would call ahead for the chicken schnitzel to go with mashed potatoes. It's so good every time and the portions are very large. I've brought my Mom and Brother there separately and they were also impressed."}
{"text":"Great service. Good servings/value for money. Delicious food. Would go back. The free baba ganoush and hummus are an excellent touch! Just don't get filled up on that alone!"}
{"text":"My bf and I visit this location on a busy long weekend afternoon around 2pm. We got seated very fast and service today was really good; friendly staff, clean. The portions here are HUGE. My bf had the turkey club sandwich which was really delicious! I had the angel pasta shrimp and lobster in rose sauce instead of cream sauce. It tasted okay. I will def come back here when in the area and try something new on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with co-workers. It is always soooo busy here and we heard some great things so we decided to check it out. Because of how busy they were it took a while longer than I would have liked to have our server come and take our order. The food was decent but nothing special. The price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Do not finish the bread. You will get full. Everything here is yummy!  I have always loved Green Eggplant:   The location is awesome. You can't go wrong being in the beaches. It's a very sleepy town at night but bustling during the day. There are other restaurants and coffee shops nearby including Menchie, Starbucks and other places I have not visited.   The servers are amazing. They're really friendly. Like McDonald's ... they give smile for free. Their hostesses are patient even to the beachy hippines (is that even a word?) and to mothers with strollers (we come in with a baby in tow). They give you water once in a while.   TRY THE MILK SHAKE. And you will never have milk shake for a long long time. That milk share, which is yummy, can feed four babies. F*ck the calories, exercise later or swim at the beach. I bet you it's enough calories that you need for the day. But you won't have milk shake for another four months right? Right?   The FREE appetizer are delicious. They're generous with their free hummus.   Admittedly, I forgot the name of what I've tried it. I can literally point my finger at any item (am only allergic to spicy food) and I know it will be delicious.   Come hungry. But do not finish that appetizer. Leave room for your order!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Went here today for lunch with a friend.  We ordered that lobster, spinach, and artichoke dip with chips to share then we also shared the classic burger with sweet potato fries.  Everything was okay, but nothing wowed.  I didn't make it to the burger.  In fact, I just packed up my half and will have it for lunch tomorrow, so the jury remains out on the goodness of the burger. However, the story checks out for sure about a couple things; the portions are insane.  And this place was busy.  Ambiance?  Meh.  Not feeling it.  The best thing was our server who was friendly and attentive without being fake."}
{"text":"My friends told me about this place and we finally tried it this past weekend.  They raved about the salads and they were right.  This is a great family restaurant.  I would describe it as a higher-end Pickle Barrel crossed with Me Va Me or some other Mediterranean-type of restaurant.  The portions are huge!    As soon as we sat down, our waitress brought bread and dips (two eggplant and one humus) which were delicious (complimentary of course).  I ordered a Margarita.  It came in bowls-sized glass and was delicious (for $7).  It was probably twice as big as I would have received any most other restaurants in the City.    We ordered the Mediterranean Grilled Vegetable Chicken Salad ($12) with avocado (the avocado was an extra charge).  It was enormous.  The chicken was grilled perfectly and was nicely seasoned.  The dressing was light and delicious.  I would have liked more grilled veggies but I am now being picky.  I couldn't have finished the entire salad anyway it was that big.    We also shared the Whole Red Snapper ($20) which came on a sizzling place with salad (the side Caesar was delicious and the croutons were homemade and awesome) with sweet potato fries (also an extra charge but well worth it - they came with a large portion of spicy mayo for dipping).  The fish was nice but I would probably order the chicken Shish Kebab ($15) next time or the Rack of Lamb ($24) since other diners had ordered these dishes and they looked and smelled amazing.  The shish kebab came on two skewers and was huge!    We were in a hurry and were too full to order any desserts this time but I think they are probably huge as well.  We are very much looking forward to our next experience at this restaurant.  I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Diners who frequent the stretch of Eglinton between Yonge and Spadina are a fickle bunch. Le Pain Quotidien does a brisk brunch trade, and Seven Numbers is filled most nights, but for the most part the neighbourhood is known for it's failures: Wolfgang Puck once teased us with the promise of fresh California cuisine before abandoning the strip; Gladstones and Umami failed in their attempts to bring upscale kosher dining to the masses; Lichee Garden retreated to the wilds of Thornhill, and now exists only online, threatening a return to the downtown core.  The Green Eggplant follows a pair of high-profile efforts at brand extension; the Meron Brothers, and Dipamos. The original Green Eggplant may be found in the Beaches, if you're so inclined.  Dinners follow the pattern set by better Mediterranean restaurants around town; a garden salad soaked in sweet dressing, followed by chicken schnitzel (Big As Your Head) atop enough Basmati rice to feed a village. The schnitzel arrives golden brown, it's crust flecked with sesame seeds. The interior disappoints. The chicken breast has not been pounded flat, so cooking is uneven. Instead of a thin, tender fillet, the bird is alternately dry and chewy. It demands  lubrication from the alleged garlic dip alongside.    I'm picky about fish in Toronto restaurants; but the Zoomers at the table are made of stouter stuff. They survived wars. What's a little freezer-burn? 8-inch fillets of rainbow trout arrive, announced by the sound of their crisping skin on  hot platters (good) and the smell of days spent pining for the fjords (bad).  Lobster and Jumbo shrimp pasta is similarly portioned, although one hunts for the seafood like Ahab on the high seas. Protein and vegetables are lost in a mass of overcooked angel hair, which is inexplicably cream-sauced. As the meal progresses, the pasta unionizes; one can't take a forkful without engaging the whole bowl.  Be warned; the kitchen may have recently acquired one of those tools that turns ordinary vegetables into long, thin ribbons. They appear on everything. The salad comes topped with a tangle of carrot string, and my dinner ran with the blood of wiry raw beets. It's a neat visual trick, but challenging eating, since raw veg is harder to twirl around a fork than say, cooked pasta, and attempts to cut them down to size yielded pieces that rested uneasily on the fork. It was cute, then, wildebeest-ie, and would otherwise violate the principle of North American social eating, that one never wants food to hang from mouth to plate in an uninterrupted line.  Chicken shish kebab and grilled vegetable salad repeat the pattern. Nobody can finish their plates. To-Go packs are offered as a matter of course. My Schnitzel winds up going home with somebody's grandmother. I can only hope it was set free on a farm out in the country, where it can play with the rabbits.  This is middle-eastern food repurposed for the Cheesecake Factory set. And they flock. This crowd arrives early. We are seated promptly at 5;30, to accommodate the geriatrics, The staff are short, blonde and cute, though snippy once orders come rolling in.  I leave the Green Eggplant as more families pour in; one kid asks his parents why they come here so often. I almost want to answer for them \"because that's just what we do\"."}
{"text":"Food is great everything is really good!!  The only problem we had we asking for water.."}
{"text":"You could certainly do worse in the beaches, which is not a dining destination. They make a pretty good cheese burger here: juicy and no nonsense. It's a shame the fries are pre-frozen and subpar compared to the burger. Portions, overall, are huge."}
{"text":"Very surprised Green Eggplant has such a high rating on yelp.  Went here with tzutzuko mu at random, as we were strolling down Queen looking for something to eat at a late hour (10pm) and there weren't too many places still serving. The kitchen here is open until 11pm.  PROs:   Ridiculously large quantities of food (if that is your thing). Georgie's pasta with chicken was honestly enough for 3 people. Came with started salad and was priced at only $13 or something. I had some grilled tiger shrimps served in a rich sauce, came with choice of side (I had sweet potato fries) plus a salad for $16. Could only eat half.   Waitstaff was friendly, food came quickly.  As mentioned, prices are cheap. Total bill with food and non-booze drinks was only $50 with tax and tip.  CONs:  Menu is meh. Caters to picky eaters really. Too many \"safe\" choices (chicken, pasta, steak, burgers). Nothing interesting on the menu. Good place to bring picky people but nothing to impress a foodie.  Decor tries to be cool but again, fails the mark. Bland colour scheme with floral paintings that likely came from Home Sense."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service!  You walk into a place by the Beaches with a group of about 10. Your group including two noisy toddlers, and 6 out of towners. It's Canada day (July 1st). The sky is spotless and this is the one day break of a weeklong heatwave. As you see the smiling hostess you tell her \"yeah, we have about 10 people including kids, you probably can't accommodate us\" as you prepare to turn around before the sympathizing \"sorry\" look comes on her face, she tells you she'll try, and this is what happens:  We were seated within 5-10 minutes, which I have never experienced when dealing with a big group of people and a busy restaurant (there was a queue when we arrived). From then on the service impressed even more; the 40+ requests of our pleasant, yet particular group were addressed with a smile, agility, and no sign of frustration! The little buggers in our group were even offered some entertainment (colouring booklet).   The food itself is not on the cheap side but it is pretty tasty (3.5*), fresh (5*), and served in huge portions. The first bonus is that the bread basket is served with the trio of fresh hummus, baba ghanoush, and fried eggplant dip, making appetizers somewhat unnecessary! For my lunch, I had the avocado chicken club on multigrain and it did not disappoint. I also tried the rainbow trout (served with a salad and choice of basmati rice/mashed potatoes/fries), and I would definitely recommend it. The waiter told us that the fish is delivered daily and you can really taste the freshness. Since the visit, I have also tried the schnitzel, and I found it filling, light, and perfectly battered as expected.   Though the choices are not exceptionally exotic or creative, what I've tried so far has been fresh and relatively tasty! Overall, the service is what will keep me going back, though that's not to say I won't be happy with the food!"}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of a friend, who lived in the area. To be honest, I didn't have high expectations going in...but I was pleasantly surprised with the entire experience.  ATMOSPHERE:  Great location, conveniently located new Kew Gardens/beach and a bit of a walk away from Woodbine beach. A great place to start or end a stroll down Queen Street East. The patio area is a bit on the cramped side, especially during higher traffic times when there is a line-up, but overall a well put-together place. We lucked out, and got a table fairly quickly, before the dinner rush came in.  FOOD:  I went with the \"Lobster and Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta,\" and was more than satisfied. The angel hair was prepared just right, not under or over-cooked, and was tossed in a light cream sauce. The number of shrimp and chunks of lobster were fine - excellent presentation as well.  The entree's came with a nice house salad, which was simple but noteworthy due to the dressing they used - upon inquiry, it turns out the dressing is a concoction of honey, lemon juice, and miscellaneous (i.e. secret!) seasoning.  SERVICE:  I was most impressed with the service. As mentioned, my friend and I dined here during a busy time of the evening, but our food arrived rather quickly. Our server was friendly and willing to go the extra mile for her customers.   After a small miscommunication (my friend's remaining salad was disposed of, after she requested it to be packed in a box), the server was apologetic, packed her another fresh salad to go, and went as far as to request my friend not to give her a tip...Now THIS is accountability and customer service, people.  I would have given her an even larger tip than I did, had I not had already paid before witnessing this exchange.   VERDICT:  I will most definitely be back here, due to the impressive service, satisfying food, and convenient location."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have no complaints I love their food and the service was great. Their portions are massive too! I got the chicken shish kabobs with the sweet potato fries and omg it did not disappoint.    On the menu it says it comes with 2 chicken skewers, so I was kind of second guessing whether it may not be enough for my huge appetite (i'm fat what do you want?!), but boy was I wrong. It was massive!  Also, love the complimentary bread and the 3 different dips that comes with it.  Super delicious and definitely recommend others to try this place out!  Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I know many people love this place and have written great reviews, but that wasn't my experience at all - and I really wanted to like it.  We were very hungry and in the mood for a nice dinner out together and had heard so much about this place, we were looking forward to trying it. Being one of the few popular restaurants (as opposed to bars) in the Beaches, it's often busy so it was no surprise that we had to wait 10 minutes for a table. That's not too bad for dinner time, I realize - but they have no real waiting area so we were crammed in at the narrow door with others squeezing in and out every few seconds. Most uncomfortable. In addition it was freezing outside and the constant blasts of icy air made it worse.  We were taken to a table by a hostess who was so busy at being busy she made us feel as if we were intruding. We were seated in the far back corner of the restaurant next to the kitchen doors. I know when a place is busy you can't be too picky, but this was a lousy area. At least we'd be close to the food when it came and it would be easy to get the attention of our waiter/waitress.   We were surprised to find the place was a little stuck in the 90's as far as decor. The sort of design Pier One thrived on 10 years ago that filled countless homes and apartments with wicker and wax fake crafty bits, scented candles, and abstract light fixtures. Lots of purple/gold/olive/rust combinations trimmed with with beads, fringes etc. A cross between reinvented hippie and some vague middle eastern references that give a trying-too-hard-to-be-quirky, faux bohemian look. It felt a little obvious and past it's prime.  Our table had been cleared, but not reset. We were handed menus and told that they were very busy but that someone would be along to take drink orders. It wasn't an apology or an explanation - it was said more like they were doing us a favour to serve us.   It was a bit too dark, a lot too crowded, and very uncomfortable. The constant coming and going of the wait staff made it feel like we were in Union Station. We found the music very loud and intrusive. In a full restaurant that makes an already large and noisy crowd have to shout over the music to carry on a conversation. I can see this sort of thing at a bar, but this is a sit down restaurant. In addition, it was very abrasive music completely out of sync with the majority of the customers age and I'd bet their tastes. (I find so many places let the wait staff choose music they like instead of what is best for the business). The shouting from the kitchen and the wait staff hollering instructions to each other as they passed didn't help.  20 minutes later no one had stopped by with so much as a glass of water or a \"have you been served yet?\". Customers who arrived after us at adjacent tables were enjoying their drinks and appetizers. Because of the noise level, conversation was almost impossible. Our patience was running out. When a  place is busy, things certainly slow down, but this place is always busy so you'd think they would know how to staff and handle that. Even a wait staff or the hostess coming buy and taking a  drink order or apologizing for the wait would have helped but we were roundly ignored.   Surely one of the staff flying by us every few seconds should have been assigned to our table? Or someone should have noticed we didn't have drinks or even cutlery? We thought of asking for a manger but decided to give it a few more minutes.   At 30 minutes after we arrived we simply got up and left. No one (including the hostess who watched us leave) stopped us or asked if there was anything wrong. I don't like going to a restaurant (or any business) and being made to feel like I have been forgotten or that my business isn't that valuable.   We got some takeout pizza down the street and went home, disappointed, angry and fed up. We have no plans to go back."}
{"text":"I love the menu but it's  extremely noisy so its kind of anti social.  Four of us waited 20 minutes to get a table on a sat nite. Reservations only for 8 or more people. Prices average. Food enjoyable and good presentation"}
{"text":"An enjoyable dinner was had here!  We met friends with a child here and the staff were very patient and accommodating!  I had the grilled chicken on skewers and it was great.  The staff were friendly and prompt and even served us some bread and spreads before the other members of our group arrived.  A friend ordered the pasta and she couldn't finish it because it was so big!  I took my leftovers home because I got full too!  They accommodated the needs of the little one by cutting vegetables really small and gave her some activities to do at the table.  Overall, their attentiveness made for a very enjoyable evening!  Bravo to the Green Eggplant!"}
{"text":"Well if there's one thing I can agree with everyone else is that the portion is H-U-G-E -any full-sized lunch or dinner can idealy feed 2 people.    limited seating + community popularity= don't come if you're in a hurry.  Everyone raved about the egg benedict here but too bad I didn't have a chance to try it... it's only served during weekends :(   Mango Bellini: A fun start to a long day! Lots of mango puree to dilute the alcohol.. great for people with a sensitive taste buds towards booze!   French Onion soup: don't go there  Chicken Schnitzel: served with sweet potato fries. Well this is why I concluded the food portion here is huge, but food is mehhh.... The chicken was overly dry. Nothing special."}
{"text":"My first time and definitely wouldn't be the last. The servings are huge so the price won't really matter. First off, it is always a busy place so be prepared to wait a little to be seated especially on weekends and on a nice summer day. If you're a large group it would be difficult to be seated right away. I ordered the paella and the pork schnitzel with sweet potato fries. Each order would probably be more than enough for two people so me and my friend weren't able to finish everything. They both come with either salad or rice I think. The service was quite fast considering it was busy and the food was amazing. I was inspired to make schnitzel myself. I've tried schnitzel in other places and this is by far my favorite. The paella was exactly how I wanted it to be. Really generous servings for the price of 18.99. Not bad. I am definitely coming back here when I hit the beach again."}
{"text":"Wait staff is horrible. When we asked for plates, the waitresss essentially threw the plates on the table. When I advised our waiter of my sons nut allergy, he seemed irritated and scoffed."}
{"text":"I had the good fortune of enjoying a meal at the Green Eggplant this afternoon. Happily,  with little wait time and I was escorted to a table and presented with a menu. My friend and I ordered a glass of wine each and sipped whilst we perused the menu. I eventually settled on the classic burger and fries. I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed mey burger. It was pleasantly seasoned and cooked to my request. The fries? OK.    I fancy myself a bit of a burger connessiuer and this one is one of the best. A nod to our waiter Raymond. He is a gem; professional, pleasant and gracious."}
{"text":"Great food. Good portions and casual environment. I will be back!! Parking is a challenge."}
{"text":"After walking along the beach on a cold wintery day we needed something to eat and spotting the Green Eggplant Restaurant we decided to try it out. My partner was interested in a breakfast special that was advertised on their sign outside. Inside the place is much larger than it appears from the outside and we were surprised to find it a lot emptier than expected. Once we opened the menu it made sense why the place was so empty. The menu which wasn't really mediterranean at all was really just a glorified diner with inflated prices. We were shocked at the prices but had already ordered some tea. Sad to say that while the food was no better or no worse than any other Toronto diner the price for what we received was ridiculous. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the hype - I've been here for brunch and dinner twice, tried different things each time and wasn't enthused with any bite.   Everyone at our table complained the food was overly salted and I definitely agree. The chicken in the sandwiches and the pasta has a sort of processed taste to it. I will say the vegetarian penne is quite good - that would be the best choice, but there's better restos in the area either way."}
{"text":"I know this is a popular destination in The Beaches, but I find the food to be really bland and mediocre. The cheeseburger is ok I guess, but over salted. Some pluses - inexpensive, huge portions and bread with three different spreads is included as an appetizer at no extra charge."}
