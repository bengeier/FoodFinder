{"text":"Fast service.  Very tasty food. Chicken wrap was delicious.  And the sauce was very good.  Nice place to meet and eat."}
{"text":"Brought my family here, few of them came from the US. I was very satisfied when I came here in the past. I shared the Fajita platter which did not come out hot, nor were the tortillas. I was disappointed with our meal. My bloody cesar was horrible, it did not taste good and only took few sips. My brother ordered an $8 poutine where the cheese did not melt since it was not warm enough. He loves poutine and likes them when he visits. The chicken brochettes were very dry and lacking flavor. Apparently the owner and management changed recently, this may explain the change."}
{"text":"Always great service. Fast and efficient. Salad bar is wonderful, lots of variety. Menu good. Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I believe they are the best of the rotisserie types of restaurant. The salad bar is a great addition to roasted chicken, good customer service and very reasonable price"}
{"text":"Ce restaurant Scores est un exemple parfait de la chaîne. L'endroit est propre, moderne et ouvert. On y offre un buffet de salades qui quelquefois pourrait être un peu plus frais. Le poulet est excellent et les prix sont raisonnables.   Un petit conseil, les articles du menu midi ne sont vraiment pas la meilleure aubaine. Il est préférable de prendre le quart de poulet dans le menu courant qui inclut le buffet de salades.  La différence de prix ne justifie pas le verre de boisson gazeuse et le dessert décevant du menu midi."}
{"text":"We were doing some shopping in the West Island before heading off for a birthday party. Stopped here to get a bite. Food was good, served quickly and efficiently. Our server was fantastic. Kept asking if everyone was happy and if he could do anything. That service is truly appreciated."}
{"text":"Horrible!  Salad bar is not fresh.  Chicken tastes like took a bath in salt.  For 20$ a person I expect more.  Just plain bad, will never go back."}
