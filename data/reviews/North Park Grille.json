{"text":"Have had both lunch and dinner at North Park Grill, which opened not too long ago. Good food and service at a reasonable price!  Try the vegetarian chili, which has fresh veggies and a nice kick to it. The salads at lunch are generously portioned and well done. We had the Greek salad. We will be going back."}
{"text":"I have been a frequent customer for a long time, but my family went for dinner and would not do it again for some time.  The potatoes were watery with no flavor, meatloaf looked like two huge meatballs, and the chicken was rubbery.  The portions were small but the few good comments are good waiter, hot plates and enjoyed the coffee."}
{"text":"A local diamond in the rough.  Excellent high quality food with friendly service makes you want to come back.  The soups are excellent and each daily special offers a new taste experience.  Plan on having left overs as the portions are amazing."}
{"text":"We have been to the North Park Grille (formerly known as the North Park Brew N Bistro) twice since they opened last month. They are open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and at dinner they offer a large sit-down dining area with a wait staff. There is an outdoor seating area as well. 

The restaurant itself is not \"fancy\" by definition, but it is very comfortable and welcoming. The servers are very friendly, without being annoying. The food is incredible. Everything from the spinach and artichoke dip to the triple chocolate cake is fantastic. 

There is a large free parking lot nearby. 

Overall, if you are looking for a delicious meal served in a comfortable atmosphere, give the North Park Grille a try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for coffee and a meeting.  The one barista at 8 am making two cappuccinos from packets of pre-ground  and pre-measured coffee took over five minutes, then served me a not-very-good drip coffee.

There was loud and bad seventies and early eighties era disco music in the background - better music, more appropriate to the presumed college age clientele, or softer music would have been much preferred. 

The place was freezing - this on a cold winter morning - we had to move away from the windows but it didn't help much.

I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I go in the afternoons around 4pm and get a hot chocolate and Bialy's Bagel & cream cheese. they have changed names a few times in the past couple of years but menu seems the same and made fresh. desserts always look wonderful and people are always coming in to get a coffee and go. Nice place to sit and catch up on emails or homework."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful service, perfect prices!  Loved the potabello mushroom soup, sirachi shrimp, meatloaf, tandoori shrimp"}
{"text":"I don't know if it was the holiday's C staff running the register, but I experienced rude service and an unpleasant surprise as I ordered my food.  I received two gift certificates for $5.00 (totaling $10) and went int to get a bowl of soup and soda.  The girl at the register told me I could only use one certificate and not both.  She then condescendingly confirmed this with the manager.  What the hell?  Seriously?  It wouldn't even total $10 for soup and a soda and I didn't want any change back.  The girl had an attitude which annoyed me.  And not accepting both the gift certificates was a stupid business decision and an improper way to treat a new customer to your shop.  Thank you, but no.  I will be taking my business to my favorite coffee shop on the east side -- to Caribou in La Plaz -- where the atmosphere is better and staff is polite and quick.  And the muffin I got with the remainder of my $5 was stale.  Fail."}
{"text":"Great dinner restaurant! Mediterranean platter is awesome and can be shared by 2-4 people. Must try the BBQ pork shanks with coleslaw and roasted veggies- Divine! Great prices and great service."}
{"text":"A-Ok not to say I won't return, but it isn't my first place for breakfast/brunch. The breakfast menu is limited to egg sandwiches (about 6 variations), bagels and other assorted baked items. Not terrible, just kind of blah. 
Its also interesting that I was charged $2.50 for a medium sized cup of coffee, without refills. This on a morning that I hadn't had any coffee until 10 AM (kinda a bad hour to deny my addiction).. 
Overall, not a bad place for a cup of coffee and a nosh, but not a breakfast-y meal.
However, lunches are a different review... Salads are FAB! very Cafe 56 inspired."}
{"text":"So I came to the North Park Grille for dinner with a friend, and it was a nice experience.  I had the crab cakes as an appetizer and the mushroom risotto entree, both of which were pretty good.  The entree came with two sides of your choice, and we picked steamed vegetables and macaroni and cheese.  Both were alright, although the mac and cheese was perhaps a little bland.  I'd say in the end, the meal was good, although nothing in particular made it stand out.  The menu did seem to have a fair amount of variety, however, and the prices weren't bad.

As far as other aspects of the restaurant went, the restaurant itself was not particularly fancy, although it did have a nice home-y feel to it.  The service was excellent, and everyone I interacted with was extremely pleasant.  They even went out of their way to split the food my friend and I were sharing into two separate plates before bringing them out.  Overall, I thought my experience there was pleasant, and if the restaurant were closer to where I lived, I'd probably be back more often."}
{"text":"went there again last night and everything is as good (make that excellent) as it was before. this might be the most underrated restaurant in cleveland. big portions, very resonable pricing and good drink pours!"}
{"text":"I haven't actually set foot in the door but sampled many items at Yelp! Helps. I wish I had been on an empty stomach so I could have returned for more and more samples. The tilapia cakes were amazing, as were the meatloaf and mashers. Looking forward to sitting down and sampling some more!"}
