{"text":"Over priced for what they have.  Had a salad with homemade croutons, they were deep fried and you could squeeze the grease out of them, gross.  The cheese steak, ok that is not steak, maybe some type of processed meat.  gross also"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Tried the Jersey Dog and the mac n cheese. They were good. Not outstanding. Nice variety on the menu and really clean place. They could have turned down the music just a bit. I would eat here rather than the local McD's any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Clean the grill!  Cheese steaks had a vile burnt oil flavor as did the fries. Couldn't wait to get home to brush our teeth. yuk. Didn't notice the mustard pump was almost empty until it burp splattered across the condiment table onto my shirt. I'm outta here."}
{"text":"Went here two weeks ago after a newspaper review recommended.  Absolutely will not go back.  There was no visible cheese, or cheese sauce on the sandwiches.  The meat was big chunks, not chopped like most cheesesteaks, and I don't think it was rib-eye.  The macaroni anc cheese had no flavor at all.  Kraft mac and cheese from a box would be an improvement.  french fries were regular frozen fries.  Pricey for what you get. If you really want a good cheese steak, drive to thunderbird and 83rd avenue and go to the gyro palace!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! And way too empty!!! Tried the pepper steak with cheese sauce and provolone - superb!!!  Mac and cheese was great.  Next time bacon Mac and cheese though.  It was a first time here for my wife and I and we both loved it and will be returning.  Soon!!!"}
{"text":"Great little steak shop. Staff is very nice. I had the cheese steak and cheese fries. The price was affordable and the food was yummy. I will definitely be coming back for lunch."}
{"text":"The Good:  The decor and service was nice. The Bad:  The steak was dry and flavorless.  The rolls were the store-bought french roll type that are sponging and gross. The Ugly:  very pricey for flavorless food.  $40 for 3 cheesesteaks, 1 Italian sub and 3 drinks.  We will not be back"}
{"text":"Tried this place today and it wasn't bad.  Shared a cheesesteak, fries and bacon Mac and cheese.  Food was good, served quick."}
{"text":"Sad to say but I'm glad this place shut down.  The food wasn't that great but the service was alright and the anti gun propaganda they had on the door, what's the point.  Went in three times and yes, I carried three times."}
