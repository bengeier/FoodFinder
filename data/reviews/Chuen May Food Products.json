{"text":"Beside Thi Thi Subs, they have a big selection of frozen dim sum to steam at home. Prices are on par with other places - very reasonable.  Big fan of the pork dumplings - fat and juicy. The shrimp wontons are also excellent. Some might think they're a bit on the small side, but I quite like them that size; perfect one bite wontons in soup.  They also hold a cooking class once a month. Haven't tried it yet, but is certainly on my list.   Will keep coming back here."}
{"text":"The shop owner was super rude and condescending. The items didn't have prices on them and he ignored my questions with a rude tone. I think they give special pricing for those who can read the Chinese signs and rip off those who are Gwai Lo. Not coming back here again!"}
{"text":"I'm feeling generous and I'm going to share my #1 dim sum store. Chuen May sells the best ginger/pork dumplings, pork and vegetable springrolls, and sticky rice in town. I've honestly hit many many dim sum stores and this place has the best pork dumplings and sticky rice. They also sell frozen Chinese stews, which were just like grandma use to make. They use high quality meat, not scraps or poor quality stuff, like some places. Very good value for this high quality."}
{"text":"Uh oh, I'm in trouble, now.   Up until today, I was happy to buy my frozen dumplings, wontons and steamed buns from the grocery store. After making a purchase from Chuen May Food Products, though, I've been spoiled.  This is a tiny cash only store in Chinatown in downtown Calgary. The store consists of a few freezers from which you can browse and grab bags of frozen dim sum products. On my first visit, I tried two products: the steamed bbq pork buns and the pork and vegetable wontons.   The BBQ pork buns were on the smaller side, but I saw this as a benefit since they didn't need to spend too long in the steamer. The filling was nice and sweet with large chunks of pork. The wontons were perfect tiny bundles with a satisfying chewy wrapper. Whereas frozen wontons are often bland, these wontons were bursting with flavour.  I hear this place is a supplier for many of the dim sum restaurants in Calgary, so I'm almost feel it's a secret that you can buy the same items to cook at home. The products do have English labelling and the store provides little slips of cooking instructions which is a lovely touch."}
