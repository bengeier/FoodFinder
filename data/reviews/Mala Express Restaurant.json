{"text":"Good quick spicy noodle soup. First time here and the service is good. Try the Mala Tang basic noodle soup, no meat"}
{"text":"This place is really bad and they keep posting shill reviews of themselves. Avoid! 

I paid $11 for the Original Chongqing Spicy & Sour Glass Noodles which ended up being a bowl of sweet potato noodles with some chili oil and soy sauce, NO PORK nothing. 

I had the Soup with Beef and Mustard Noodle and it was inedible. The meat had so much fat and gristle, the soup was overpowered with vinegar. 

Mala Express - Don't try to cover up. Fix your food!

edit: see below."}
{"text":"To be quite honest, this is possibly the worst place I've gone to in the downtown core. There is no service in this place and with what you paid for, you are not getting your money's worth. Waitress barely speak any English and after she put the plate on the extremely gross table, she never came back to check on me. First time I didn't tip, but I had my reasons! Definitely won't go back!"}
{"text":"They pride themselves for their authentic Sichuan food, but if you take a closer look at their kitchen(On your way to the washroom), you see spice and sauce spillage all over the floor from their imported boxes. The plastic bowls they use for their hot soup have a weird smell, I don't know if they reuse them after each and every day, or their imported plastic bowls from China are just not up to the safety standard. Considering the portion you get, the price is outrageous. $20 for a meal that barely fill you up."}
{"text":"This is one of my worst restaurant experiences in my entire life. In fact, I would not say this place is even a restaurant. Because one you enter the place, you will be shocked by the ambience. It is like a food court occupied by one vendor. You will understand what I mean if you visit the place. 

Let's move onto food now. I got a bun and their signature noodle soup. Both were so terrible that I felt like throwing up, literally. After one bite of the bun, I instantly knew it has been frozen for quite some time and warmed up in microwave. It was terribly dry and hard. The soup tasted weird and dirty and potion was mediocre. Surprisingly, prices are really high for what they are. 

Also, food that is sitting in hot hold (I am not even sure if it is) looks extremely unfresh and dirty,

Next service, the lady who works at the front and the man who works at the back - I think he is the cook - are both nice. The lady was informative as she explained about the food in detail. The man was kind and friendly. Since they seemed like nice people, I feel bad to write a bad review but I have to be honest. 

Also, I have this feeling that the couple of good reviews are written by their family and/or friends because I can confidently say that it is just impossible for anyone to have had good exprience there. I know everyone  is different and has different taste and all, but there are things that everyone has to agree- like \"winter in Northwet Territories is cold\". It is that obvious. 

I am sorry Mala Express but you guys did not work hard enough to be in the business. You insulted the restaurant industry."}
{"text":"Authentic Sichuan cuisine (unlike the 'Szechuan' places that sell General Tao's etc.) at fast food prices. As the 'ma' ? in the name implies, most dishes here have Sichuan Peppercorn (?? hua jiao), and also chili pepper (?? la jiao). You can customize the level of both spices, but I think the spiciest level of both is just delicious. All sorts of different dishes, the cold noodles are perfect for summer."}
{"text":"I personally really like this place. When i first went in there was no one there because it was 3 pm in the afternoon. It was my day off so I decided to go out and get my munchies on today. 

I was greeted very kindly and nicely by the lady at the front desk. We conversed for a bit and she asked me if it was my first time here. She recommended me to try the \"ma la tang\" selection for my first time and so that is what I went with. I got the medium spicy option, which is the middle spice level here.

I really like the food here. It's truly ma la, meaning numbing spicy in English. The numbing feeling comes from cracked peppercorns I believe. I got a combination of various offal, meat, veggies, etc. I got just over 0.2 kg of selection today and it came out to approximately 5 bucks without a drink. I didn't really need a drink because of the fact that there was already soup in the actual dish. 

If you are someone who recently came from China or Asia or a North American native or someone who comes from anywhere, this is a place worth coming to. It doesn't matter if you are vegetarian or a meat lover, they will cater to your taste buds and preferences. 

I wasn't even hungry when I came here but I left a satisfied customer!"}
{"text":"I hate to say this but this is a horrific place. It's not a restaurant. The seating is like a food court, and no service. 

To make it worse, the food is not worth trying. I question the quality of the oil they use. I don't know how to describe it but it looks \"dirty\" to me. I'm also kinda suspicious that they reuse their oil over and over again. 

I had been wanting to try it for days but now I'm sorry to say that I will never come back again."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this place is no longer open. I went there today (April 13, 2016) around 1:30pm in hopes of getting some ma la tang. A \"closed\" sign was on the door and a \"for rent\" sign was in the window. Bummer :("}
