{"text":"I come here every week and I'm never disappointed. Meilleur comptoir libanais à Montréal!!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I was pleasantly surprised and how tasty everything was. I have the chicken shawarma with a salad. Was fresh and seasoned well. I tried the falafel and it was fantastic, it was made fresh and you can tell. It's not the fanciest restaurant but makes up for it in the fresh food I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Propriétaire hyper sympathique, bonne bouffe, bon prix. Le meilleur libanais à LaSalle!"}
{"text":"Top notch Lebanese place with a dedicated owner. 
Very tasty, very fresh. Charly actually wants to be there, showing off superb Lebanese food, fried some onions and tomatoes on the meat rotisserie and added those to the plate with our meats...delicious. 
Thanks Charly!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite in the afternoon. Had a chicken shish taouk sandwich. The owner dressed it for me with hot sauce and pickles in addition to the standard toppings of pickled turnip, tomato, onion, lettuce and garlic sauce.

The sandwich was delicious, and the staff where friendly and helpful. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Où est Charly?  Il avait les meilleurs falafel de la ville et tout ce qu'il faisait était délicieux!  Je suis très déçu d'apprendre que ce resto est fermé. :-("}
