{"text":"Great spot for a Friday lunch.  To start, the chef came over to recommend the red peppers stuffed with ground meat and rice.  They were very tasty. Panko crusted pickerel was the special for the day and I'm so glad I tried it. Two large pieces of fish, perfectly cooked, over baby beets, squash, brussel sprouts and potatoes with a light sauce. Carrot cake with cream cheese icing for dessert was decadent. The service was excellent. We had wine which was good and our water glasses were never empty.  Very satisfying!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to dine with your family.  I have 3 children and the menu catrers to kids and the staff is wonderful.  The patio is super comfortable and inviting.  A great restaurant in woodbridge!!"}
{"text":"I recently organized a retirement party in their private room and was greatly disappointed when the menu they had discussed in the contract was not the one we got.  Tried to talk to the owner, but he was no where to be seen and the manager was no help in trying to resolve the problem.   I certainly would not recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have to say this is one of the classiest restaurants in Vaughan. The food is out of this world and the customer service is something I have never experienced before.   I had the Shrimp and scallops in a cognac sauce for dinner. I highly recommend it was light but tasty. My husband had the steak special and he said they made it just they way he liked it Chicago Style! The other couple we went with had the penne alla vodka. She said it was the best penne alla vodka she had.  We ordred a bottle of sterling wine cabernet and it went perfect with all our meals.   For dessert we had a nutella mascarpone.. Heavenly! We will definetly be back. They also had a live band which sets the mood for a great night."}
{"text":"Nove means \"nine\", but with a grill like no other, dining here is a clear \"ten\". From the moment we open the doors we are welcomed by the aromas of the charcoal grill and wood-fired oven. Cornish hen, tender and crisp, is the star of a platter of grilled meats from NY strip steak to Ontario lamb. Chef Rick Antonucci makes his rounds to ensure his guests are content.  We are. Risotto with field mushrooms and reggiano cheese, simmered in white wine and mushroom stock, is a luscious mouthful of flavour. The pizzas are chock full of a garden of ingredients, and we devour the crunchy thin crust. Fresh linguini simmered in a white wine tomato broth ribbons around a medley of king crab, shrimp, calamari, mussels and clams. We arrive early, knowing tables fill up, for the love of good food."}
{"text":"I know that i'm Italian and I can eat home cooked Italian meals every day but I seem to be a sucker to eating at Italian restaurants.  Lets add Nove to the list.  To be honest ive probably passed Nove many times but haven't really paid attention to it.  We were going out with a few friends and they chose Nove.  I wasn't sure what to expect seeing that there were not too many reviews on Yelp.  The restaurant is trend, all waiters are wearing ties.  We were quick to be seated and the waiter was quick to take our drink order.  The food was all cooked to perfection.  Tasty, seasoned properly and portions were very generous.  Too much to type to get into details but I am posting pictures below so everyone can see how great the food looks.  I will be returning to Nove.  There are many items on the menu that are a must try for me."}
{"text":"A restaurants true service happens when the place is jammed with patrons  Saturday night and it's communion and confirmation parties  It's a hectic time as food needs to come out quickly and warm or hot  Pizza   nice crust Grilled Veggie, Prosciutto,  cheese/tomato, olives platter - fresh fresh  Calamari and Scampi  - better than most but served cold...hmm I prefer it warm  Risotto with fungi -  done right and moist Geme Pasta in a rose cognac sauce - nice Al dente  Veal chop the size of a baby - juicy and full of flavor  Mixed salad  Ok I am stuffed  Before Nove it was Pane Vino (horrible service and lackluster food so they went  broke and sold to new owners)   They redid the room in a modern style and chose to offer a high level of service and great food  So Nove means Nine so not quite a 9/10 but a rounded up 8/10"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, lovely atmosphere.  Hard to stand out in this area, with so many great Italian options, but if our first visit was any indication, this place is one of the best around.  The menu is very meat-heavy, with much smaller selections of pasta and pizza, which stands out compared to a lot of places around.  Lamb shank, osso buco, cornish hen, streak, veal, you name it, plenty of options. But are they any good?  I had the Rib Eye which was the special of the night and it was killer. Cant wait to come back and try more.  The rigatoni was fabulous, not too rich, and the margherita pizza was super salty and fresh tasting. Amazing."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. No doubt this goes a long way and if this review was only about the food Nove Ristorante would get 4 or 5 stars. Unfortunately the space itself leaves a lot to be desired. First impression is that the transition from outside to inside is not welcoming nor entrancing nor awe-inspiring. Instead it is a bit disorienting due to the curves, angles and sight-lines. That first impression can be compensated for with a really great second impression... which was not forthcoming. Bottom line, the worst part and the cause of the loss of at least one star is the terrible acoustics. Noise travels and is echoed and amplified. The relatively large and open space is completely lacking in sound absorbing surfaces. Everything is hard. And being in the space is, therefore, hard. I was in a rush to leave. That's fine for fast food. It's not so good for a nice Italian place."}
{"text":"Great Italian food -  frutta di mare, pizza, veal chop and pasta all delicious, no complaints at all.  This place is good for a night out or for a private function, would recommend for a baptism or private party."}
{"text":"If you want ambiance, good food and good service, I recommend Nove. Great wine selection and food is delicious. I always feel you have to appeal to all the senses....... visual and how the food is plated is so important. My mouth watered by the visual sense, taste was the delicious sense. Whatever you order from appetizers to pastas to main course, you won't be disappointed. Should you decide to indulge in a dessert, the carrot cake is sure to please.... fresh, moist and delicious. Plan to go back soon"}
{"text":"This is a fabulous restaurant in Woodbridge that brings me back to my summer eating my way through Italy.  To start, we had the Supplì ($10) and the Polpette ($12). The supplì had a light crispy shell with a cheese center and zesty fresh tomato sauce on the side. Taking a bite of it transported me back to the food markets of Rome.  The Polpette was probably my favourite part of the meal. The veal and pork meatballs were so flavourful, juicy and tender and the tomato sauce and slices of Padano cheese on top made it even better.  For our mains, we had the Pappardelle ($20) with a flavorful, tender, melt in your mouth braised short rib ragu. The noodles were thick and perfectly cooked.  The Ravioli Riccardo ($18) was stuffed with wild boar and Padano cheese and then topped with perfectly cooked crimini mushrooms, roasted cherry tomatoes and a savoury browned butter sauce. A great mix of sweet and savoury flavours in this dish.  The Risotto ($21) was perfectly cooked with the rice maintaining just a slight firmness in the center. Served with wild assorted mushrooms and Padano cheese, and simmered in white wine and mushroom stock, this was a creamy and tasty dish.  When I dined here, the main restaurant was closed and we ended up eating in the side banquet hall so I cannot comment on the atmosphere of the actual restaurant - but from looking in through the window, it looked classy and beautiful. This was a wonderful meal with first class service and surprisingly large portions. Will not hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Been here on several occasions. This place is great for family functions or just an intimate date for two.   They offer antipasto platters for large groups which is awesome when you have a table of 10 and don't know what everyone wants to start with.   Wine selection is relatively large as well here. The food absolutely delicious. This place definitely has a foot above a lot of the other restaurants in the area.   Will continue to do business here and would recommend this to friends and family who haven't had the chance yet.   4/5 for me!"}
