{"text":"This place is great! They are still relatively new and have a great game selection. The games are in excellent condition. The location is super convenient, close to Osgoode station near the Crepe cafe and Mevame. It is tucked up on the second floor so I don't think a lot of people know about it yet. Owners are super friendly and helpful. The place is spotless and really comfortable. They are open late (til 2am on Saturdays) and prices are very reasonable (unlimited play for $7!!). Highly recommend it! Also, they take reservations, so no disappointment or long waits."}
{"text":"My first time at a board game cafe and it was actually really fun! Popped in just to check it out and stayed for hours! They have a big array of games to suit anyone's preference. Staff are really great at helping you choose which games to play and will walk you through the instructions if you are new to the game. 

Location is ideal, right downtown. Surprisingly good coffee as well! Make sure to try the London fog. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"Very fun and relaxing. Manager is very gracious. Different games to pick from, definitely worth going with friends"}
{"text":"Thump up for their friendly service. I have been there twice so far, both time the staff suggested board game based on group size, and taught us how to play, which saved time to read the instruction, leave us all the fun time to play."}
{"text":"Great Cafe :) I liked it better than snakes and lattes. Clean, great atmosphere, and the best mugs xD Very modern design, simple and aesthetically pleasing. Gary was really friendly and extremely helpful. The games he recommended were really fun. Will admit, the menu was a bit lacking as I didn't find anything that appealing. Good drinks but I wished there were more snacks, like maybe cake? Pastries? Fruit? Smoothes? Fair pricing and good selection of games. Also, I really loved the music that was playing. Snow patrol, goo goo dolls, the Fray..... right up my alley :) Definitely will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group for friends after dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday. We played avalon and exploding kittens. I had such a great time because the staffs were really helpful, the company was great and the price was really cheap!

They have a huge selection of games here that can accommodate for all group sizes which was very convenient."}
{"text":"Board game Cafe.... Came here after work for a night of games but was kind of disappointed with the place as it has wooden tables and chairs.. Not a comfy setting.... The host however was very inviting and explained the games we wanted to play well.. Sat with us and ensures we understand the game would come here again.... We also got the tuna and Nutella sandwich both were good"}
{"text":"Came at 1 pm on a business day (on business hours) ,  they were closed. No sign or anything,  the door was just locked. Thanks.

Edit; but they were pretty cool about it in the reply,  so we'll come by and hopefully change the rating change into a five :)"}
{"text":"This location just opened up about a month ago so there we not many reviews but I will provide as much detail as I can! The store door is on the left side of Me Va Me and you go upstairs then make a right! 

We came in just to end the night with some games and it was AMAZING!
The owners were super nice and helpful!
They helped us by introducing new games that were absolutely exciting and were very good at explaining each game!

We went on a Tuesday so we got the $2 Toonie Tuesday special! Which was basically $2 to play all night! we ordered drinks (tea, coconut water, and coffee) and stayed around for around 2-3 hours and paid around $5-$6 EACH PERSON (Anyone who has ever been downtown Toronto at 10p.m. in an establishment for around 2 hours KNOWS that this is an AMAZING DEAL!!!)
I THINK on a regular night it is less than $10!

They gave us complimentary Macarons that were tasty and very kind of them!
The environment is very very comfortable; the tables and chairs make you feel like you're at home, there is enough space so you don't feel too close to other tables. 
We lost track of time so fast but enjoyed every minute!

The female washroom was very clean and the separated stalls were a nice private touch!

The owners seem very genuine and appreciate each customer! They are tentative and suggest other games which is nice especially if you don't know which game to start with or which game to transition to next! 

The menu is one page single sided, so don't expect a HUGE restaurant-style menu. However, you spend all your time playing that all you really want to do is snack on their sandwiches and have some tea!

For our first time there we were already planning our next trip back! The location is perfect for late night dates because it is in the heart of Toronto. We almost didn't want to tell our other friends so that it would be our \"chill\" spot! 

The music playlist was SO FUN! They have throwbacks, rap, pop and just things that everyone can sing to! There wasn't one game where my friends and I weren't bobbing our heads to or singing along (quietly of course).

CONCLUSION?
Recommend to friends? YES!!! perfect for casual dates, hanging out with friends
Inexpensive? Very! compared to other board game rooms 
Atmosphere? Comfortable, relaxing but lively!
Game Selection? Not a large selection compared to locations but have your staples! enough to have fun!
Service? Very helpful and enthusiastic
Location? Well I mean Queen Street across from much music HELLO pretty much accessible to TTC/Subways, shopping and restaurants! With so many things to do around there this is PERFECT for stopping by.

I REALLY HOPE THESE OWNERS ARE SUCCESSFUL WITH THEIR BUSINESS! MY FRIENDS AND I HAVE FINALLY FOUND AN INEXPENSIVE, QUALITY HANG OUT PLACE DOWNTOWN!"}
{"text":"This place was nice and cozy on a cold night! They were able to accommodate for 17 of my friends and I (of course upon reservation). Staff was absolutely great, and was very helpful when it came to board game selection. Our server was extremely helpful and not only recommended the perfect games, but also taught us on how to play.

Great place to be if you're looking for something to just sit down and chill!"}
{"text":"Not really sure why this place has so many 5 star reviews. It's alright... but when you've got snakes and lattes in the game, I think they need to step up their game to deserve 5 stars. 

First off, their game collection is definitely not as extensive as Snakes and Lattes, so if you're a group of board game geeks looking for that semi-unpopular game you likely won't find it here. However, this place still has all the staples like Catan, Dominion, etc so any group of casual players will be satisfied.

When I came here with my boyfriend we didn't really get serviced until we asked. They sat us down and that was it. We didn't understand if they did pay per hour or one time payment. We didn't even know if they served food because we didn't get a menu. In the end we asked and FYI its $3.50 per hour or $7 unlimited play and yes, they do serve food.

I know this place is a board game cafe, but I was still pretty disappointed in their food menu. I mean even Snakes has a more extensive menu and here they only serve sandwiches and a couple of snacks (cookies/chips/crackers). EHHHHH. They have a good variety of drinks tho?

My boyfriend and I stayed for a decent amount of time, but we probably won't make the trip here again. Unless Snakes is packed, and we're desperate, then perhaps. Could the redeeming factor here be that they take reservations? Maybe!"}
{"text":"A for coming back Again!

We were a party of 7 and sat comfortably at a large table. It's a sweet deal not having to line up for hours for a crowded space to play, on a Friday night. They charge $3.50 per hour or $7 for the whole night. Games are in mint condition and they've a decent selection. It was definitely a plus that they had all of our favourites - Catan, Seven Wonders, Dominion, Munchkin, Carcasonne..but the best part was the service. The owners were super friendly, incredibly knowledgeable, and suggested games that we ended up loving. Our new favourites are now Machi Koro and Camel Up!  They also explained the games very well and were just fun to be around. 

Having been to a few other cafes like Castle and Roll Play, I would definitely choose A-game over the others. Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends on a Saturday afternoon. We have made a reservation but it wasn't really needed since it was quite empty. They had a wide variety of games and employees were friendly. They were kind enough to explain the game throughly to us and how to start the game. The cafe has a promotion going on on groupon right now so please don't hesitate to use it. I couldn't give it 5 stars because their drinks selection were slightly lacking and the portions were small. Closest parking is in the building where shopper drugs mart is with a flat rate of $10."}
{"text":"A really nice clean place for board game enthusiasts. New and very reasonably priced - a great way to spend the evening for under $10, in lovely company, and safe surroundings. The owners are super friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the games. They explain them extensively to you so you don't waste much time learning to play!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to many board game cafes, but this is definitely one of the best I've been to.
The decor is really good, games are well maintained, and the staff were friendly and prompt. I had a lot of fun with my friends and there were so many games that we haven't played. I definitely want to come back again soon."}
{"text":"Friendliest staff ever and a great selection of games. $3.50 for the first hour and $7 for the whole night. They even called us back when they had a table open...we were 15 minutes late and they were nice enough to have a table reserved for us. One of the best game cafes I've been to so far."}
{"text":"I'm really into board games nowadays and these board game cafes keep popping up. A-Game Café is a place where they will not pressure you to order stuff from their menu and it's a place where you can relax and have fun just playing board games.

They have an hourly rate of $3.50 per hour. However, the maximum limit is $7 so basically once you play for 2 hours, it's the unlimited all-day play rate. 

The owners are really friendly and really knowledgeable about board games. They sat down with my friend and I and taught us multiple games such as Forbidden Island and Agricola. Their explanations were easy to understand. If we had a question later while playing the game, they would immediately help us.  

The café is really tidy and neat. The board games are also in brand new condition. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and probably will be back someday!"}
{"text":"***4.5***Really enjoyed my time at A-game cafe. Was here from 6:30pm  to 12am.  They close are 2 AM Sat.  What I love about A-game is..... Staff was wonderful!!! I can't express how good they were without yelling. They came to our table many times and recommeded games and even sat with us and showed us the rules.  Absolutly love this.  Only reason I didn't give them full marks is that it is more pricey than Snakes and Lattes $5 vs $7 for unlimited plays and less board games as well.  There food menu is not as good imo. Place is pretty small compare to other boardgame cafe I been to.  Overall I love this place and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Cute place to meet friends for a games night or have a date night. Good selection of games and great (!!) owners. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable about every game we played.

I'm definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My boyfriend and I easily spent an hour here just playing Jenga and uno. I recommend getting a Groupon so you can get a voucher for food. We ended up getting the milk and cookie tray and t was more than enough for the two of us."}
{"text":"Love this place (located in the middle of the fashion district with lots of nice surrounding stores) 
Great cheap date or for a few friends 
Food is sub par (mainly straight out of the box)
Although the game selection is a bit smaller than other cafes it is cheaper and less busy (also check Groupon for deals for here)
Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"A-Game Cafe is a hidden gem in the entertainment district. My friends and I came here yesterday night for board games after we had dinner nearby. The cover charge for an hour is $3.50 and $7 for unlimited play over two hours; with no pressure to buy food or drink which I think is quite reasonable for a board game cafe. They have a good selection of games. What I particularly appreciated was the staff's friendliness and that they gave our group a reservation - not many board game places will book off tables for groups (they're usually first come, first serve/walk-in), but they did. :) We had a good experience overall - all the staff were very knowledgable about games, helpful and enthusiastic. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a board game cafe and I loved it!  It's $3.50 for one hour then $7 for unlimited play after two hours.  I was amazed at the variety of board games they had and how helpful staff were in explaining the games and saving you from reading extensive and sometimes frustrating directions.  Staff will set up games for you, make recommendations based on what you like, and they don't pressure you to purchase food/drink.  I was surprised at how knowledgeable the staff were about so many games, most of which I'd never heard of.  I ordered the London Fog (earl grey tea latte) which was very tasty!  The cafe is quite small and can fill up.  It's a super fun way to spend time with friends.  I will definitely be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"A for awesome! Definitely bringing its A-Game to the downtown/financial district masses. Being super accessible to subway (steps from Osgoode), its only competition in that category would be Roll Play, but A-Game has a cozier atmosphere, phenomenal staff and can't complain for the super affordable price of 3.5 per hour per person (max 7, can play all day/night!)

The selection here as others mentioned isn't as large as, say, Snakes and Lattes, but most likely they will have most games you would play (we sampled Telestrations and Catan during this visit). Also saw Ticket to Ride, Puerto Rico, Cards Against Humanity, Bang, King of Tokyo and so forth.

The menu is very reasonable and they're great with free water for the table. No pressure to order anything. The copies of all games are still in mint condition (amazing compared to more established places which are already showing wear/missing pieces). Owners informed us there is toonie Tuesdays ($2 flat rate all night!) and Settlers of Catan Mondays. Finally a great place to hang out with a large or small group downtown, will be back!!"}
{"text":"We arrived at A-Game Cafe just before 2 p.m.  They are located on the second level so be sure to look out for their entrance way when you are walking down Queen Street West.  They occupy the second floor level and had a comfortable open layout of tables and chairs as well as great selection of board games for you to choose from to play with.  They are not as huge as some of the other board game cafes in Toronto like Snakes & Lattes but we really enjoyed our time here to play in a non-crowded and relatively quiet space.  There were several other tables of people playing board games too but the noise level was moderate.

We tried the Reuben Sandwich which came with a choice of an apple or chips.  I chose the Jalapeno chips.  The service here was really attentive, friendly, and prompt.  The staff really made sure that their guests were well-attended to and could explain game rules to you if you needed help on a game.

The Reuben Sandwich with pastrimi, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut on marble rye was really good!  The marble rye was toasted just enough to be crispy on the outside and the pastrimi, melted Swiss cheese, and sauerkaut made a great sandwich!"}
{"text":"A nerdy and cozy place to chill and play board games with friends. The price is pretty good, around $3~$5 per person. They also have a discount on Tuesdays (Stay fee reduced to $2 when you order). Since it's open until after midnight, it's perfect for a late night date/hangout."}
{"text":"I found out about this place on Groupon and decided to come on a Sunday afternoon with my boyfraan. The Groupon was unlimited game play with a $10 food credit, such a great deal! The place was very quiet when we got there (around 3) but it eventually became busier. Peter gave us game recommendations and explained each game to us very clearly. We played some easy, quick games like connect 4, ghost blitz and rhino hero (super fun) and a slower strategy game called lantern. Peter made sure we knew how to play the games before letting us play on our own and came back and forth to make sure we were okay. We had a very enjoyable experience and will be sure to come back :)

Tip: remember to bring your A-Game"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently got into game cafes. When we saw a Groupon for A-Game, we decided to check it out. A-Game is a really clean and cool shop located not too far from Chinatown. There are a lot of things to love about this place. First, and most importantly, the staff are incredible. They are more than happy to sit down and teach you a game. There were several times during our two visits in which we were struggling a little bit with the rules, and they came over to help without us even asking! In addition to great staff, I loved the games that are available. I played Exploding Kittens, Love Letter, Bang!, Secret Hitler, Splendor, and Sushi Go Party! during my visits to A-Game. They also have some of my favorites including Settlers of Catan and Ticket to Ride (both the original version and the European version). There are quite a few games to choose from and the staff are happy to recommend a game if you're unsure of what to play. Another thing I love about this place is the restroom. It is extremely modern and very clean. In addition to games, they have a limited menu that includes espresso, hot chocolate, soft drinks, and some sandwiches. I would recommend coming on Tuesdays when it is only $2 to play all day (so long as you buy something to eat or drink). If you want to play all day during another day of the week, it is $7. In sum, a great place to pass an afternoon or an evening as A-Game is open until midnight during the week and until 2 AM on Fridays and Saturdays. I would highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"The best game cafe in Toronto and the only one we will go to now! And here's why:

1) the staff help you pick games by asking thoughtful questions and you end up finding games you love and have never heard of 
2) then, the staff explain how to play the game and set it up for you so you don't waste time getting frustrated or reading the rules 
3) it's super fairly priced: $3.50 for one hour or $7.00 to game as long as you want 
4) there's no pressure to buy food or drinks - although the longer you stay the more you just feel like having something :) 
5) it's a clean, simple, and fun environment 

Rock on A-Game Cafe!"}
{"text":"A spontaneous visit here one rainy Sunday afternoon & it's my first visit to any game cafe. Clean, organized & friendly, there was ample seating for large (4-10) or small (2) groups. They have a wide range of games (the popular staple games are there), one shelf for each: board & card games (so don't miss the card game shelf at the back!). 

Service was great - when we walked in, we were promptly greeted by one of the owners, friendly and approachable. He sat us down appropriately, let us be when we were browsing games. Then when we chose one, he happily came over to ask if we needed any explanations (we did), so he confidently set us up, even dealt us our cards to start the game! He sure knew how to get a feel for people (asked us if it were our first time; when to intervene or not) and he was knowledgeable in his games. I saw him doing this equally for other tables - which was great to see - that's what community is all about! We stayed for almost 4 hours. Ended up being the last ones staying, and without asking they offered us ice water, promptly refilling it, making sure they let us know that we weren't forgotten. Did not get to try their food or drinks, though I saw they are a bit pricey~

Overall, I'm very happy that I stumbled upon A-games as my first experience of a board game cafe because they showed me a great environment. I commend them for their success in this cozy cafe and I would love to be back one day!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite game board cafe I've visited in Toronto. All three times I've been here, the service is exceptional. They are so helpful and quick in summarizing the key points of the game you picked. True experts who seem to know every game... Amazing!

The rate is very reasonable and they occasionally have deals on Groupon.

They can be a bit hard to find as they are located on the second floor of Me Va Me near Much Music, but with anyones smartphone gps, it's not an issue.

Fully stocked with all the games. I haven't heard of 99% of them. But then again, I only knew Monopoly/Jenga/old school kiddie games to begin with. Recommend the Ghost Blitz game. Quick for impatient people who don't want something that takes an hour to learn, it's very fun and requires you to pay attention or lose.

One thing I can say is, the food and drink menu aren't the best. Not much options aside from chips/cookies/coffee drinks. They don't have a full service kitchen as it IS a board game place so I won't deduct any stars, especially when the guys working here are ultra cool - I sometimes see them not just teaching but also playing with the customers."}
{"text":"Awesome place to hang out and play board games. It's $7 for unlimited play, and the staff are always friendly and willing to recommend a game and/or teach your group how to play a game."}
{"text":"Adorable board game cafe located conveniently in the fashion district. For $7, you can play for as long as you want. The staff here are fantastic and will walk you through any game you want to play. There's no outside food/drinks allowed in here, but they do have a select menu of snacks, sandwiches, and drinks. The food here is pre-packaged snacks you'd find at any grocery store, so I'd recommend eating before you come. Gratuities are added to your bill for groups with more than 6!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. It was smaller than I expected it to be, but still had quite a large selection of games to choose from. I came here with a Groupon,  but prices on their menu are reasonable... $3.50 for an hour of play or $7 for unlimited play time. 
I had an iced coffee, my boyfriend enjoyed a hot tean, and we split a very yummy Nutella and banana grilled sandwich,  which came with an apple (or chips, your choice) on the side. 
Started off playing some classic games, and when I was looking to try some new games, the staff members were very helpful in introducing some new cool games! 
Overall,  I had a really fun time, and would recommend it, however,  keep in mind that there is (or was at least) a Groupon available for this place!"}
{"text":"This place is fun and cheap. The selection isn't as vast as a few other spots in the city but you don't usually have to wait for a place to sit and the coffee is strong! Snacks are not bad either"}
{"text":"I came with 5 other friends with a Groupon for 4 people (really worth it). The place is quite small compared to other Board game cafes I've been to, but was a cozy place and atmosphere. There are sofas for those who want to feel at home. They offer a wide variety of games on 3 or 4 shelves (the ones that I've seen) but don't have as much as other BGs, but they have the popular ones for sure. 

The staff offers good service and is very friendly, coming from time to time to ask if there's anything we'd like or offer to teach us how to play different games. Foodwise, we ordered chips & salsa and cookies with milk. The price is very fair, and the portion is enough for us to share with 6 people. We had fun and we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place because of their sidewalk sign... They are located on the 2nd floor and I don't think they have any other signage other than on their door so it would be difficult to find otherwise. 

I walked in with my party of 6 and was promptly seated. It was a clean, modernly decorated space. The staff explained to us how the cafe charges at $3.50 per person per hour, with a cap of $7. Not bad! 

On to the games selection - it was not as diverse as the biggest board game cafes in the city. However, they did have all the games that mattered to us (*cough* Catan w/ Expansion Pack *cough*). The game pieces appeared like new and were not worn down at all. Well kept.

My only gripe with the place is that the staff came and asked us if we were okay a little too many times - and at awkward times too. We were pretty set on just playing games and not ordering any food, so I felt the excessive checking up was a little much.

Other than that, it was a great experience at A-Game! Would definitely return if I'm looking for a cafe in the area again."}
{"text":"Another board game cafe in Toronto...and this one is great!  Went on a Friday afternoon and the owners were very attentive, picked and taught us games, and even played with us since we were the only people there.  

The board game selection is not as large as the other big game board cafes but it has the staple games you'll need.  Plus it's cheaper, much less hectic, and the service can't be beat.

Overall this place is great, super awesome guys, can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Had such an enjoyable time here! They have a variety of board games to choose from and very friendly staff to give you recommendations. They also have a small menu with some sandwiches, snacks, and hot/cold drinks. We had the triple decker PB & J which was yummy! It came with some Ms. Vicky's chips too which was a bonus. 

Will be definitely be back! 

It would be helpful if the board games were organized by number of players."}
{"text":"Far and away the best board game cafe in the city. Phenomenal owners & staff, great variety and condition of games, and most importantly an amazing community of people - fun to go alone or with a group."}
{"text":"Came by on a weekday afternoon and the cafe itself was about half full. There was a pretty large selection of board games, although quite a few of the games we picked out seemed to be falling apart and quite tattered, which is a bit disappointing. Their drinks were wonderful, my cappuccino was made very well, but their snacks fell flat. We ordered a platter of cookies to share amongst us, and they were pretty small and just some Oreos and Peak Freans, all just off the shelf, nothing that special to justify that price. Overall, it was fun, but there are definitely some issues with quality that could be ironed out better."}
{"text":"So far I've been to A-Game 2 times. Found it actually browsing Google maps one rainy night hoping to find something fun to do outside of Netflix. The cafe actually stays open pretty late so that was nice. 
I'm not a board game enthusiast, probably beginner baby level if that level exists. So obviously I can't speak for avid boardgamers, but so far I've found it really fun and enjoyable! The selection is pretty varied, from card games to Jenga to more intense board games where the rules mostly just go over my head.

The first time I went was pretty late at night so there were only a few people there, the second time I went in the late afternoon and it does get pretty busy and loud which is a nice atmosphere. It's not a big place so it could get full pretty quickly. 
The food menu is limited, but they do have some good drink options! My go to is always the London fog, and it doesn't disappoint! 
The prices are pretty reasonable, $3.5 for an hour and $7 for unlimited play, and honestly when you get into a game it's gonna be more than an hour, cause you know you need to get revenge if you lose. 

The staff are also super nice, they'll make suggestions for games based on what kind of game you're interested in, or your experience with board games, and they'll take the time to actually teach you the rules of game play which i greatly appreciated! Saves a lot of time from figuring it out yourself. They also come by to check on you, make sure that you're not lost out of your mind. 

All in all, it's a cute cozy little place, great staff, great game selections, would definitely come back again! 

Also it's pretty cool that the artwork is actually for sale. Just a side note."}
{"text":"My friend was walking to dinner and saw a promotion for this board game cafe. So we decided that we should check it out.  I'm really glad that we did! Gary,  the main guy who helped us pick our games, taught us how to play Bang.  I lost after one round and he noticed that I was the only one that wasn't playing.  He suggested we play Monopoly Deal while my group continued Bang without me.  I thought it was a really sweet gesture! Overall I had a very great time and our group can't wait until they get their liquor license.  Would most definitely come again with other groups as well! The convenient location is also a big plus for me."}
{"text":"A-Game truly stands up to its name. They offer a huge selection of both classic and niche games, super friendly staff who will happily teach/play with you when you're down a player, and cheap prices ($3.50/hour or $7 unlimited stay, drinks for $2-4). 

Their simple yet spacious interior can fit ~50 players, yet they are always packed. Great place for a chill night with friends (and some friendly competition of course). Also conveniently located near late night food joints for you night owls."}
{"text":"Very poor selection of food. need some more welcoming vibe.
Not many people, almost odd to play game.
Staff was nice but I rather pay more place like snake and latte so I will have more game option and food."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of board game cafes nowadays. This place is pretty small but they do have a lot of board game options. I came with ten people and we got the biggest table available. The place is first come first serve with unlimited stay so for $7, it is hard to complain about the comfort level of the chairs and tables. It is $3.50/hr otherwise and they do accept cash or cards. The menu is limited but the drinks were pretty good. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Games: I'm a hobby gamer so I'm not as well-versed with the hundreds of board games out there but I do have my favourites. As long as the game board cafe has them, then they're great in my book! A-Game cafe was the very first one that we ever went to. A friend and I purchased Groupons for it (always keep an eye out for these..great deals!). I've gone back several times including as a group of 4, 3 and 2 and each time it's been great. They have a good selection of the more common ones as well as ones that seem a little more hardcore. The game pieces are in good shape with very minimal signs of wear and tear. 

Service: The folks that work here are the best compared to the others that we've been to. They are attentive when it comes to asking for our drink/food orders as well as teaching us the games. A worker once sat down with us for at least half an hour to teach us Dead of Winter. We really appreciated it and have since played the game again. They are also really good with sharing their recommendations in addition to being so friendly and enthusiastic!

Overall experience: My friends and I really enjoy coming here to play games. They've recently moved to a bigger, brighter place; however, it's slightly less convenient for us because work and the subway was closer but we can certainly drive here if needed. 

Cost: $7 for unlimited play (+ any cost of food/drinks)"}
{"text":"A new board game cafe in Queen West! They have opened up in the space above Ma Va Me, which was formerly a Spring Rolls. There are lots of tables and lots of games. There is a small menu with various types of coffee and sandwiches. It's a nice spacious space. Bathrooms are clean! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Visited the A-Game on a Friday night with 2 other friends. The place was buzzing but not over capacity when we got there at around 9pm. The owners were polite and efficient, persuading a group of 2 to move to a smaller table so they could seat us right away. I like that the tables are spaced out well and very clean/well taken care of.

One of the owners, Derek, personally seated us and asked if we had any games in mind or needed any drinks. We asked him to recommend a simple worker placement game to start and he brought over Code of Nine, which none of us have ever heard of. He made quick work of setting up the game and explaining the rules and stayed to help out while we played a practice round, offering tips and explaining strategies. It shows how passionate the owners are about these games and added a personal touch to our experience. 

The staff there are friendly and so attentive. They probably came around every half hour to make sure we were attended to (with water, game recommendations/help, etc.). Loved every minute of the visit and definitely will be back if I am ever in the area. At this price point, visits are also quite affordable. I do agree that the game selection is a little lacking compared to other board game cafes, but they have all the popular games and the service more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"Pretty good board game cafe. Small and cozy. Owners were very helpful in showing us the games and provided good recommendations. They didn't have the most comprehensive library of games but had multiple copies of new games. Couldn't comment about the food since we only played games."}
{"text":"This is my second visit at this cafe and words cannot describe the outstanding service I have received here both times.
The helpers are always attentive and come up to you offering help which I appreciate a lot, because honestly, reading game manuals can be painfully time-consuming and mentally taxing. 
One of the hostesses recommended her favourite game: patchwork, which in turn I will recommend as well. It is a two person puzzle game that challenges you in a way similar to ticket-to-ride, but progresses much quicker. Definitely give it a try if you plan on visiting 
On that note, I will say that not only are the staff friendly and approachable, they have good taste in board games as well!"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to A-Game by a friend with Groupon deal and then went again with a party of 7 with 2 groupon deals. While there were less games in terms of game selection, the staff was attentive (particularly to sandwiches with nuts), space was spacious and cozy with many unique games. It made our surprise birthday party a success and we will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came by here to play some games while on vacation from Philadelphia. We have been to many different board game cafes and played many different types of board games, and like to learn new ones when we have the opportunity to.

What sets this place apart is that if you want, the owners Derek and Gary will sit down with you and teach your group a new game that you would like to try, but have never had the opportunity to play. They love gaming, and it shows. They will even join in to play if you'd like! I have never seen the staff at any board game cafe go out of their way to teach rules for games, give general strategic points, and play upon request. This is worth the price of admission alone. The prices are very reasonable as well.

Clean, no pressure, no minimums, no elitist gamer attitude, and super friendly. My wife and I will definitely be back when we are in town again."}
{"text":"Located on the 2nd floor of a building on queen west so it could be easily missed. (Thank God for Google map)

We arrived 2 hour before closing and that was probably why it was so empty. We took our seats and it's $3.5 per person for 1 hour or $7pp for unlimited hours.

They have a range of easy foods and desserts and a decent selection of games (less than the original board game cafes). 

The worker who was serving us was playing a game on the big screen so we couldn't cash out without having to interrupt him.. (I mean I'm glad he's having fun but he is getting paid.. lol)

We ordered the latte not expecting much because they don't specialize... and got exactly what we were expecting. Not terrible + nice touch of the latte art 

Wouldn't go out of my way to go back unless around the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Great place with large groups. The employees there are incredible and extremely friendly. They know all the games and are very enthusiastic in helping you with the rules of whichever game you decide to play. Highly recommend this place as I'm sure it'll have the board game you're looking to play here."}
{"text":"- love love this place, it is a bit pricier than snakes and latte but the customer service was great. There were people walking around showing you how to play so no need to spend an hour going through the instructions on the game box 
- I tried:
    + tuna dip with crackers, the tuna was mixed with small slices of sweet peppers, pretty flavourful
    + hot apple cider: it had strong taste of cinnamon but on a good side tho, I'm not a fan of cinnamon but really enjoyed this drink
- Price: $5 for an hour and $7 for unlimited play 
- the place was small but I enjoyed it"}
{"text":"Visited because I wanted to do something fun for my anniversary.  I found them through Groupon and was able to purchase a coupon for unlimited play plus a $10.00 food voucher. The location was easy to find on the second floor and is a very cute cafe. The staff was very friendly and helped my husband and I pick a game out that was better suited for 2 people. We ordered a tuna sandwich, grilled cheese sandwich, two drinks, and a platter of cookies. The food was very good. The cafe got packed and loud but didn't take away from our game.  The staff helped us with the instructions and continually checked up on us to see if we had any questions and to see who was winning! We played three games and stayed about 4hr. I really enjoyed the A-Game cafe and would recommend this place. Make sure you check out Groupon and call ahead for a reservation."}
{"text":"Great environment to play board games. The service is great with friendly staff that provides great recommendations and teaches you how to play the games to get you started.  

Their game selection is fairly large as well. You won't find yourself out of games to play."}
{"text":"I've been to A-game many times in the past year and every time it has been an amazing experience.

Derek and Gary, the owners, are friendly and extremely knowledgeable with every game.  They have a knack of making complex games easy to learn, and are very patient with beginners.

This place is great when you want to have a fun and relaxing night with your friends.  There is a huge selection of games and a great atmosphere.  Not to mention it is located in the downtown core.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I really love this place! I have been going as part of a meetup and it is so far the best board game cafe in the city! Firstly, it is super clean and low key, which means for the most part it is't too busy (unlike snakes and lattes, which gets to be insane). Although it is smaller, they have a diverse variety of games of varying difficulty and general theme.

What really makes this place is the crowd. Everyone is super friendly, especially the regulars. What's more, the owners are the nicest guys (Gary and Der(r)ek) with super warm personalities who are always happy and ready to explain new games, or even play with you if the cafe isn't too busy. 

It's a reasonable price at $3.50 for the first hour or unlimited play for $7. Food and drinks (non-alcoholic) are also available, and it all seems well done!"}
{"text":"A hidden Boardgame place located beside Me Va Me restaurant. The only sign available was printed on the clear door which isn't obvious. Walked up the stairs and there it is. The place wasn't that big but there were quite a few tables that could probably fill up around 30 people or more. 

I went in with my friends for a Groupon deal. $29 (I paid $23 instead) for 4 people comes with unlimited play and $20 food credit to share. Since I only had 3 people. It rounds up approx. $8-9 per person. We each ordered a London Fog latte ($3.75), tuna with crackers ($6.50), and a bag of Miss Vickie's jalapeño chips ($2.25) to share. Totaled to exactly $20. The deal wasn't much beneficial to us since we're missing one person. Without the groupon deal, there is a $7 fee for unlimited play. Otherwise, there's another price for limited hours play. 

The food selection on the menu was okay. It includes a bit of everything beverages, sandwiches and snacks. The food portion wise was decent.

If you're kind of new and was just looking for a place to play a few popular Boardgames. Then this is a place for you. The collection definitely ism't as huge as the other Boardgames cafe like Snakes and Lattes but it has all the mainstream ones that everybody would enjoy playing. To name a few: Tenkenoko, Catan and expansions, Camel Up, Cards Against Humanity, Concept, Survive, Pandemic etc. 

The staff were very friendly and accommodating. They offered games suggestions and taught us how to play which was pretty much like the other cafes does.

Considering someone who has been playing Boardgames for awhile. I would most likely not come back again due to the selections but it was a fun day."}
{"text":"I came with friends as a group of 4 and we played Kittens In the Blender and Cards Against Humanity (the group favourite). We had a fun time, but it's too bad they don't have a larger selection of snacks and drinks. At least the place has a nice variety of games available.

The ones working here make sure to stop by our table every once in a while in case we want anything. Good service!

Not a bad board game cafe, but there are better."}
{"text":"My friend suggested this place because she had a voucher from Groupon for this place. It sounded fun, so I asked two of my other friends to come. 

It was Victoria Day and we were super excited that this place was open for business! We were a par-tay of 4, looking forward to playing games that we used to play as kids. 

Games: There were a lot of variety- board games, card games...etc! Some I have never seen before! My friends and I played: Battleship, Uno, and Jenga for three hours. 

Food: We had sandwiches with chips. I had nutella-banana sandwich with jalepeno chips. The sandwich was so gooey and warm, I liked that there was a generous spread of nutella and thick slices of banana. The jalepeno chips were great as well- crunchy and spicy! 

Service: Friendly, attentive, easy-going. A gentleman greeted us, took our orders(for food), came by to refill water & to ask if we needed anything throughout our stay.

We had a great time! I can't wait to come back!

**Important note: Make sure to make a reservation so that you & your company will have a table when you get there :)"}
{"text":"nothing flashy but an amazing game cafe, with a huge variety of board games collection, simple and cheap food menu, good sitting space, it is a very good game cafe. 
Only cons: it does not serve alcohol :P 

the guys here are helping, they help you choose a game, explain you rules and are very friendly."}
{"text":"Clean space, staff was friendly and helpful with games - gave us good recommendations and helped us start a new game. $7 flat fee for anything over an hour, pretty reasonable. The game selection I'd say isn't as big, but enough to have a good time."}
{"text":"Checked this spot out today with a friend who had been here once before, great layout and selection of games. The owners are in it for the gaming not the terrirotory and this is the first games cafe where I had someone actively explaining the games (if not known) and interacting with the patrons instead of just standing behind the counter waiting while trolls take the place down with elitism ;)  Great menu, a free drink and that's not water and wow a cookie plate with a cookie monster (yes cookie, blue not green one they changed it to) mug.  Really impressed with this spot and will be back"}
{"text":"Good space, their Groupon deal was well worth it.

They had a good selection of games, and their staff was very friendly and accommodating to our needs. The layout is quite open, so there are no feelings of discomfort, even when the interior is packed."}
{"text":"You've probably walked right past it on Queen West numerous times as it's upstairs. *Not wheelchair or stroller accessible*  

It's need and clean and can accommodate groups up to 6 (maybe even 8). Great for a rainy day or if you're looking for a fun but low cost date night. It seems to get busy on weekends around late afternoon. Large groups should call and make a reservation as there are only about 8-10 tables in total and most are 4 person tables  

They carry quality tea (Mist-y) and make London Fogs that I heard were quite good. As well as simple sandwiches as well as carry Ms Vickies chips and apple slices. 

All the chairs are wooden with NO CUSHIONS so if you have a sensitive butt you may not want to spend hours there. 

Decent board game selection including both competitive and cooperative games for 2. As others have mentioned the staff check in on you and will patiently teach you how to play a new game. The staff really make it a warm place. 

The bathrooms are clean and there's 2 women's washrooms. 

I've been twice and really had a good time. The most recent time we played the new Trivial Pursuit and later they found the old version. (green box with the white lettering) and so we played a shortened version of that. Really fun! 

Would I go back? Yes"}
{"text":"Awesome cute board game store! The owners are brothers and are super cute! I love their old style coke bottles!"}
{"text":"A very laid back game cafe that you pay $7 for all you can play. It wasn't busy when we got there and we were seated promptly. However, we were not given a menu so we were confused whether we should order at the counter or ask the waitress. 

We found some simple games to play but soon got kind of bored. The lady who works there offered us some help and asked what kind of games we like. She recommended us a game and taught us how to play. Service was very friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"You're looking for a place to chill with your friends, It's cold outside, and their is a big wait line at snakes and lattes...so why not go to A-Game Cafe!

The place is relatively small compared to the big places but honestly it is a nice place to be at. You got a ton of games all of which have been played by a member of the staff, hence they can explain any new \"complicated\" to you. If complicated translates to hours of gameplay that is $$$, well go for the unlimited play for 7$. 

They are a cafe so dont  be surprised if you don't see lasagna here. Their menu consists of a variety of hot & cold drinks, sweet treats, and sandwiches (the 5 spiced ice cream was interesting).

As stated earlier each staff was knowledgeable with regards to the games. Many thanks to Gary who spent probably 30 mins explaining 'Dead of Winter'. As we continued our game he would periodically check in on us to see how we were faring. 

It is good to meet people who are passionate about what they do. You can tell from the way they speak about a game or what they can recommend, or their personal connection with board games. This personal touch is why I really enjoyed my time at A-Game Cafe! (That and unlimited play, woohoo!!!)"}
{"text":"By far one of the best board game cafes in Toronto. Friendly staff, fair prices and a variety of beginner, intermediate and experienced selection of board games. The have Catan, with various expansions and extensions. Their Game Gurus are experienced and always willing to teach you! They have 2for1 entry deals on Tuesdays, and Catan meet ups on Mondays with a special pricing of $7/PP with any drink on their menu! I highly recommend their latte, so delicious! There's never a line up or a long wait like other board game places. My new BoardGame spot!"}
{"text":"I come here Monday nights for the Settlers of Catan league and often other nights as well. It's a cozy environment and has a satisfying variety of games. The owners and regulars are very friendly and are happy to teach you and welcome to a game. On busy nights, the cafe doesn't close until hours past midnight.

Overall, an awesome place to relax and play/learn a game. If you come regularly, pay with Smoothpay or the cafe's own app to get 10% cashback rewards."}
{"text":"Came on a Toonie Tuesday with friends, $2 for unlimited play with the purchase of a food/drink, which was a bargain! It's located on the 2nd floor so the entrance was easy to miss. The interiors were basic and clean - more cafeteria seating than comfy living room but no complaints at that value. There was also no line and it was more quiet and spacious compared to other places. I'm not a hardcore player but there was a nice collection of games in good condition that were also neatly organized. The staff were friendly and genuinely interested in sharing the fun of board games. I saw one of them patiently teaching another group how to play and checking in later to make sure they were having a good time. I got a tea, the cheapest drink at $2.75, and was pleasantly surprised that it was loose leaf.  Overall a lovely time for a good price."}
{"text":"Many board game cafes in Toronto have a great selection of games, a convenient location and a good menu, however what makes A-Game stand out is the attention and care that the owners put into every part of the guest experience. Derek & Gary's passion for games is evident in everything from the pristine condition of the games and impeccable cleanliness of the place, to the decor on the wall. You're not getting the most out of your visit to A-Game unless you chat with one or both of the brothers, and invite them to join you for a game. As the board game cafe craze continues to sweep Toronto, many venues lose sight of the fact that it's the people, not the games you play with - a quality that A-Game delivers on in spades."}
{"text":"A-Game Cafe is by far the best game cafe in the city. My girlfriend and I have been to the more well known spots in the city(Castle and Snakes/Lattes) and have never been this impressed. A few things stand out about this place. The guys working here are second to none. They not only suggest high quality games but also stick around to teach and run a game simulation. My girlfriend and I were taught Jaipur on our first visit and then Splendor on our return visit. If we ever had any trouble during the game, we were assisted right away. It's very easy to tell that they're committed to providing a great experience. If you're looking for a relaxing night of fun, this is the place to go."}
