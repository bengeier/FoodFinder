{"text":"I have eaten here multiple times at the old location and the food was always very good.  Now went to the new location last night for the first time and ordered the eggplant parmigiana.  I have to say it was honestly the WORSE meal I have ever eaten anywhere.  I couldn't spit out the first bite fast enough.  OMG don't know if I we will ever step foot into this place again."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for our anniversary and overall were pleased.  The pasta was cooked perfect (al dente).  My wife had pasta with their traditional red sauce.  If you like sauce that isn't sweet, you'll like theirs.  I prefer sweet, but I understand not everyone likes that.  I had the penne with vodka sauce and chicken.  The chicken was grilled perfectly and was juicy.  And the vodka sauce might be the best I've ever had.  

The waitress was waitress was polite, but a bit unprofessional.  By appearance this place looks very upscale.  But she didn't convey that.  She sat with customers to take orders and the way she carried herself.  But she seemed to be a teenager, so one can expect that I guess. 

Their prices were unbelievably low.  We didn't drink, so I can't attest to their bar prices.  But we got out of there with spending under $40 after tip for the 2 of us and we even had an appetizer (fried Zucchini which was okay).  

Unfortunately I've got to give 4/5 for a few reasons.

-Because they drowned my wife's dish in sauce.... like seriously.  I know they're proud of their red sauce, but slow down.  
-We ordered salads but they never brought them.  
-Their iced tea was brewed WAY too strong
-Waitress was unprofessional to the point where it was a bit annoying. (not rude, but don't act like we're ordering wings from hooters.)

I'd suggest giving this place a try.  Their new location is really nice and the ambiance is nice.  And their food won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Worst meal I've ever had, and that includes fast food restaurants. I ordered Pasta Fagioli soup and it was like eating a can of white beans swimming in water with no seasoning. Next up was Fettuccine Bolognese, or at least that's what they called it. First there was the presentation. Yuck! The plate looked like something a dog would regurgitate. The noodles were so overcooked they fell apart when you tried to twirl them. Once I got over the unappetizing look of the meal and tried a forkful I said \"no more\". It was tasteless, the sauce tasted canned and there again was no seasoning. It just tasted like the noodles had been kept in water for hours. Then the waiter came over and asked if I liked my meal. I said,\"no, I don't\". He offered to get me anything else but I had already tasted my husband's ravioli, which was terrible also, so I declined anything else. I ate two bites of my meal and so I left a plateful of something that I obviously didn't like and then the waiter asked if I wanted a box to take it home? Really?? I declined again. Then he brought our bill and he charged us for my meal! We paid, left and vowed never to go back there again."}
{"text":"Have given this restaurant four chances... Disappointed every time.  Spaghetti sauce tasteless..  Margarita pizza undercooked and mushy... Soup watery... Servers slow and inattentive... Place busy but I sure won't be going back."}
{"text":"We visited the new location on RT 22 on August 23.  I have been eating/drinking at the original location for years which I have never had a bad experience.  However this visit to the new location for the first time left a sour taste in my mouth.  The food was not my complaint.  The server (Amanda M.) was absolutely one of the worst I have ever experienced anywhere in the world.  Since when was it OK to throw straws at paying customers?  I thought after the first time it was a mistake....then she did it again!!!  At that point I was turned off by the whole experience.  I ordered a Peroni on draft....guess what?  Never showed.  I walked up to the bar and ordered it myself.  The entire time the waitress was short and curt....definitely not as asset to this place.  The decor seemed lacking in the new place....nothing on the walls....seemed cold like a warehouse.  I would go back again because of the prior great experiences and food, but If this happens I again I would never return or suggest anyone I know go there.  Management needs to be more involved."}
{"text":"Awful service. Arrived a 5 and ordered a pizza, at 5:40 they came out and asked what toppings we had. Told them what is was and another 10 minutes later still no pizza. Long line for carryout developed and we could see other customers getting really angry. We got tired of waiting, wont go back."}
{"text":"I wrote a review when they first opened, noting the crowds and the high noise level. However, now that the initial crush has settled down, I find that the place can handle the number of folks stopping by. Their pizza cooked in the wood fired oven is outstanding, and the rosemary bread appetizer is my new favorite. Glad to be able to relax once a gain in my favorite local eatery.  And am anxiously awaiting the opening of their new grilled cheese themed place in their old location. What's nit to like about grilled cheese and home made soup? Yum."}
{"text":"Very bland meal. Had the penne salmon asparagus dish. Salmon was from a can. Asparagus were all stems no heads. Pasta was way under cooked. Salad was ok"}
{"text":"I can only speak to lunch here as I still haven't had dinner at this restaurant. It serves a very good Italian hoagie and a solid chicken Parmesan hoagie. I especially like the soups. The pasta fagioli soup is very good as is the wedding soup. I agree with other commenters  that the service is uneven."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but the portions were tiny. Thank goodness they gave us bread. Wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"I just ordered take out and when my husband came home I found my pasta was not cooked and it did not have any mozzarella as it is supposed to. When I called the complain the person who answered told me \"oh that is just how it comes\". I asked to speak to a manager who told me \"oh that's cause u did take out. When you order that dish to go it ends up like That\". The last time I went there I asked to order take out and was told to go to the other side where they do take out. When I went there I realized there was no one at
The window and it was closed. I told the hostesss who said \"I don't know what to tell you\". I went to the bar and was
Helped.
I thought it was a one time bad employee.
Apparently not."}
{"text":"Food appears to be more appropriate for catering. Lasagna and shells served just above room temperature, although did not taste bad. Sauce is tasty but food seems microwaved then topped with fresh sauce. 
We sat at a table directly outside of the kitchen. That table should not exist. It was loud and also faced the bathroom.
Prices were good and represent quality of food.  Disappointed with service and professionalism of the staff."}
{"text":"Great new place, good food, awful service.  Second time visiting the new location in as many weeks.  Both visits, servers seemed overwhelmed.  This time, waited 40 minutes for meal after ordering.  Appetizer never arrived at all.  Usually delicious rolls were stale.  No refill of drinks, even after they brought the meal.  If they get their act together on service, this could be a great place to eat.  I'll wait a while before going back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is such a disappointment! With that said, the food is quite good.  The wait staff needs some serious training.  I have reviewed this place previously with the same complaint, the waitresses are sweeping the floors while diners are trying to eat their dinners.  That was bad enough  but Thursday evening we watched as a waitress swept the floor and then used a menu as her DUSTPAN!! Placed the menu back with the others and shortly after gave that menu to another table of people that were seated across from us....can I just say \"YUCK\"!!! Don't eat their without your sanitizer!!"}
{"text":"This place cares about the guests. All of the food is of great quality and the prices are very reasonable! I love the neapolitan style pizza with fresh mozzarella. The restaurant is very comfortable and inviting with a beautiful outdoor patio. I hosted a wake there recently and booked it with the owner. He made the entire process very easy and we were extremely pleased. The bartenders also make some nice cocktails. I would recommend Pasqualino's for a private function, date night, or just to order takeout."}
{"text":"5 of us ate there this past Friday. The service was bad - very slow - and our food took a long long time.   The food here is pretty good, not outstanding.   The upgrade to the new location should have also had an upgrade to training of the staff."}
{"text":"The food is just average. Not a bad plate of spaghetti, pizzas are pretty good. Not the most imaginative menu. Service is fair. Wait times are needlessly long, especially for parties of 5. As a family of five, we are consistently quoted waits of 30 minutes or more even when the restaurant has many empty tables. Service is often slow. NoWait app usually says \"come on in - no wait\" and they quote 30 minutes or more when we walk in. Average food, below average service."}
{"text":"I was here yesterday with a large party with my family and we had a wonderful time! We had some drinks with Nicole the bartender on the roof top patio which was wonderful and the appetizers were awesome! Then we moved inside for dinner and everything was delicious and portions are HUGE I had the lasagna and it was the size of a casserole dish! The only complaint I have they had Nicole working the patio bar (which wasn't set up yet and it was 230 in the afternoon on a nice day) and they had her working the bar down in the restaurant as well which made her run and was pulled too thin. But overall great experience"}
{"text":"The food is authentic, and the people are great. I've never had a bad experience here, and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for great food, consistent service, and a warm, pleasing atmosphere in Murrysville."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. I have never had better sauce and pastas, pizzas, and sandwiches are always very tasty. The reason for only a three star rating is the service - which is inconsistent at best. Occasionally the service is great, usually I feel like I'm being waited on by an inexperienced teenager who has had no training. My family often jokes \"the food is great, even when you don't get what you ordered\". The good food keeps me coming back, but with a little effort this restaurant could easily be a four + star experience."}
{"text":"This last Saturday afternoon we had the Flat Iron Steak, Fettuccine Bolognese, Pasta e Fagioli soup and two glasses of Pinot Grigio.  All were excellent.  Server was friendly and paid attention to our table."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and Paul, the bartender, is absolutely awesome!  Tell him Big Mike and Lori sent you!"}
{"text":"This is a nice, small, local Italian restaurant that makes you hungry as soon as you walk in the door...it smells delicious when you walk in.

The food was fine...we had simple pasta for the kids...pizza and stromboli for the adults - all of which were very good, leaving everyone content and full.  I thought the dough of the pizza was top-notch, too - which is always a good sign of a signature, Italian eatery.

The wait staff were friendly and accommodating throughout the meal, not to mention there was a decent crowd for a Wednesday night - again, another good sign of a good place to eat.

All in all, we'll be back, as I look forward to trying other items on the menu.  If you want a sit-down, Italian meal and you're in the Murrysville area, give this place a try.  We did and weren't disappointed."}
{"text":"Once upon a time there was a quaint restaurant called Pasqualino's. Then they moved, expanded, and apparently opened another place. Huge Mistake.  They must have lost the recipes because the food is not remotely the same.  I assume the new plan is to make money on the bar.  The worst part of this experience, I could smell urine from the bathrooms in the dining room to the right of the bar.  I tried not to have to use it, but I had a hour drive ahead of me.  The fixtures were not unclean, but apparently cleaning floors are optional.  Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"Decent little local Italian place. The portions were a nice size for the price of the dish. The sauce is excellent.
The reason that I gave it a three was because the food took sometime to come out and the place had a funny smell. They also give you regular bun to eat with your pasta dinner. Not really a big deal but didn't really match the meal. I thought Italian bread or some sort of sliced bread would have been better."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, and our waiter was very nice. We went on a Wednesday evening and there was hardly anyone in there. The resturant was clean, pretty and comfortable. Will defintely be going here again!"}
{"text":"We went to the new Pasqualino's Italian Eatery location/building in Murrysville. Pulling up we saw an overloaded parking lot and we said oh-oh. But on checking in the wait was 15 - 20 minutes so we stayed. They were doing a great business tonight and they told me it is a normal weekend, but this day there were a few large parties. Seems they have a back room for private dining and there was a large group back there with a big cake and folks talking lots of pics, making speeches and lots of hugging and having a good time.
The décor to me was kind of sterile cool to cold and definitely not a typical Italian motif and without much personality. There is a kind of central bar area with plenty of seating and most people were having drinks and appetizers there while waiting on their tables. Some people just eat their entire dinner there which is a fair option of a really busy night.

To speed up our seating we were offered a high-top in the bar area and that was just fine with us.  There was lots of hubbub, traffic and action, going on in that area but it was not off-putting. The staff was working extremely hard to keep up with the volume and to keep people from waiting too long to be served. I thought they did a good job at that, and they should be recognized.
For the new location there is a new menu with lots of additional choices and standard carryovers from the old menu.  I thought I would try something new, a companion stuck with an old standard, and another tried something new, at least I think it was new.

I had the Penne and Asparagus sauce with Salmon. This was not good. Or at least it was mediocre. Not much flavor to the sauce and the salmon looked very unappealing like it came from a can and was broken up into a million tiny pieces with just a few  1/2 inch pieces at the most. The salmon was having no taste either and did not remind me of anything fresh. The pasta itself however was very good, tasted great and was cooked perfectly.

My wife had the Gnocchi with Mushroom cream sauce. This was also okay at best I would say having tasted it and by her own assessment. The gnocchi was not tender, or flavorful. The mushroom cream sauce had a lot of cream but not much flavor.  The sauce certainly did not give enough mushroom for anyone expecting that great essence. 

A companion had a real old Pasqualino's standard you could always count on, which was the Penne with their own great Marinara Sauce and their wonderful meatballs. This was what you come here for..
 
Not real far from four stars but a lot of the flavor profiles need to be improved.

Oh, and the salads were fresh, the rolls are great and the front of the house staff works hard to please."}
{"text":"Food is just ok. Very cold--needed to keep my coat around my shoulders. Service poor."}
{"text":"Revisited this Italian Eatery after a long time. We ate in the bar and had great service. The soft creamy mozzarella margarita pizza was very tasty, but the Italian hoagie was delicious. Lively scene with a cute rooftop bar and tables (serving pizza and appetizers only)."}
{"text":"Take out Pizza used to be pretty good at the old location. Got a take out recently at their new location. Cheese so runny it slid to one side of the box. And the bottom of the pizza stuck to the box!   Complete disaster of a pizza.  
Crossing this one off of my list for good"}
{"text":"One thing Pittsburgh has a lot of is Italian restaurants.  There are at least five within 15 minutes of my house.  That being said, Pasqualino's is one of my \"go tos\" when it comes to Italian.   

I have to say, I preferred their old location's decor to the new location.  It seems sort of industrial and cold in the new place.  Especially in the \"patio\" room which gets cold in the winter.    They also changed their menu.  There are more appetizer and pizza options but seem to be less dinner/pasta combination options.

Overall, I enjoy my dining experiences here.  After eating pasta in Italy, I have found it is hard to find anything in the US that compares.  Especially when it comes to bolognese.  That being said, one of my favorite dishes here is the bolognese (although I swap out the linguini for angel hair).  It has just the right amount of meat and spice.  My husband has tried various pastas and his favorite has been the vodka sauce.  We have also tried the wood fired pizzas and been happy with the food.  They have two portion sizes for their pastas (and some are even available family size/style), but it is almost double the pasta for the larger size so it is very worth it.

The down sides to eating in are the inconsistent service.  There are times when it has been really attentive and other times where we had to track down a server for things like water refills or asking for something.

Food is good, service mixed bag and decor just strange.  But overall, a great place for an Italian meal."}
{"text":"How good is the sauce?

Great when delivered hot on your pasta.

Surprisingly good when eaten cold as a leftover on the same pasta. 
Interesting: I can't imagine eating someone else's sauce cold!

Did you know Pasqualino's sauce is available in jars for take out? 
You better get some quickly before I buy all of it... really, it is that good!"}
{"text":"We waited for 30 minutes after we ordered our meals for the food to arrive.  The server didnt come over to fill our empty water glasses or bother to bring us bread.  When the meal came, my penne with vodka sauce was room temperature and sloppy.  My friend ordered ravioli in butter parmesan and it came with a good inch of melted butter in the bottom of the bowl.  When we asked for bread, she brought what looked like hamburger buns.  Horrible experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried the chicken parm and it was delicious. The price was lower than the well known Italian chain restaurant but with bigger portions."}
{"text":"Worst meal I've had in my life. Service was fine but I go to restaurants for the food. And the food was awful. Lasagna was drowning in sauce, and almost no meat in the lasagna. Meatballs were also awful. Total train wreck."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good, and the wine selection was decent. I've never had an entree here that's really stood out though. It does seem like ownership put a lot of effort into the rooftop terrace reno. Aesthetically, it's pleasant. However, it's still pretty noisy up there with all the traffic from rte 22 and wasn't very relaxing. Hope they find a way to dampen the noise when the patio reopens this spring."}
{"text":"A guaranteed five stars - abundant food and every bite was delicious!!!  Some of our dinners included pizza, salads and various pasta!

Beginning with Lisa, who helped us organize our party - we had a variety of entrées - all were delivered hot and in a timely manner!!!

We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My parents come here quite often. The decor is very nice and the service is always good too. I've tried a variety of dishes and enjoyed all of them. The steak salad and fettuccine alfredo were tasty. I was not a huge fan of the cavatelli al Pesto e ricotta though. I also ordered the prosciutto pizza and was expecting prosciutto but it had ham on it, in their defense, it does say ham in the description, I just didn't believe it. Overall, solid and enjoyable food, I recommend."}
{"text":"Great pizza! The large was more like an extra large, and the cheese actually had flavor as opposed to the crappy mozzarella that most restaurants use. The roasted red peppers with basil seasoning really made the pizza.

I did not enjoy the pasta plates as much as the pizza, but still pretty quality Italian food."}
{"text":"I called for take out and was told about 35 minutes wait. I got there 45 minutes later, the food was not even cooked yet. I eventually got my take out after another 40 minutes wait on site.  When I got home, the  calamari/shrimp appetizer portion was only half size what we got at the restaurant one week prior.  Chicken wings had no flavors. 

Called back to talk to the manager the following day, and he told me that they had recently decreased their portion, but they did not cut the price.  $ 14 for a small portion shrimp/calamari  appetizer is not comparable to their competitors. Monterey Bay calamari is only   12.95  and Atria's is 10.99. Both are much bigger portions.  I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The nose knows.  Seriously, you can smell the bread immediately.  And the sauce.  I am not your pasta lover, but I gotta say, I am when I'm here.

They seem a bit unprepared for patrons to  have to wait for a table.  You just sort of mill about.  So, of course, we started with a whiskey sour, which was ok, not great.

Seated within 10 minutes, our server was terrific and attentive.  The bread was amazing.   Not-so-small perfect carb clouds.  Followed by generous salads and soup, a la carte.  We had three pasta dishes and one calzone.  The small calzone was plate sized, perfect as a single meal.  The pasta bowls were substantial and very flavorful.

Gotta say, I won the meal round.  The Puttanesca sauce is amazing.  Black olives, capers, anchovies and some invisible hot pepper zing added some heat. Its my absolute favorite sauce, definitely not for the delicate palate.

While none of us had pizza, the shiny, hulking red-glass-tiled oven is a beautiful monster in a windowed room of her own.  We agreed that we really need to try her pizza...  and soon!"}
{"text":"WOW!  From the outside I thought, how good can a 'strip mall eatery' be?  Do not judge a restaurant by it's location!  Paul, our bartender/waiter made our dining experience outstanding.  The menu has so many incredible Italian dishes, appetizers that come in small, medium and large portion sizes.  We all tasted, dined and ate fried calamari (tender), stuffed jumbo shells, eggplant parmigiana, brick oven pizza, and their seafood special. The meatballs melted in your mouth, the red sauce was perfection and the pasta was perfect.  I asked Paul if they delivered to Carnegie!!!   5 star recommendation!"}
{"text":"Excellent pasta and meatballs. Great atmosphere and very friendly and speedy service. Always a good stop"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I think that the restaurant is likely better than 2 stars and we will return once they move to the new location. However, despite the delicious food, we had a terrible experience and left feeling disappointed. 

First, we made a reservation for 6 plus a baby and were seated promptly. A good start. When I made the reservation, I was told that we could bring homemade limoncello for the end of my mother's birthday dinner because they did not serve any at the restaurant. After being told rather rudely before we sat down that we would not be served the limoncello, I explained to the server my conversation on the phone with the hostess. Instead of addressing the issue and the miscommunication, the server simply repeated his initial statement and left us at our table. Not a huge deal, but slightly annoyed to start the meal. 

After giving our drink and appetizer orders, we were all excited for the delicious food. We ordered two carafes of wine, chianti and Chardonnay. I am not a wine snob, but I do know that the red wine that they served us was most definitely not Chianti. I walked to the bar and tried to order a glass of chianti to compare but they were entirely out. Either we were served the very end of bad tasting Chianti or we were served a different wine. Either way, I was disappointed. Maybe we are spoiled by having so many BYOB establishments in the East End, but I have not had bad wine at a restaurant for quite some time and it definitely hampered the meal.  

The appetizers came and they were ok, nothing great just fried zucchini and provolone sticks. However, the wedding soup was amazing and had a great deal of flavor without being overly salty! Yum. 

Finally, the entrees. The stuffed shells and eggplant were both delicious and the red sauce was very tasty as well. I was really impressed by the unique flavor of the sauce and thought it was by and far the most redeeming part of the meal. 

All things considered, we went in with high expectations and were disappointed by the service and wine. As stated, we may go back once they reopen in the new location, but we won't be rushing anytime soon. We will likely opt for something closer like Cibo or Bella Luna."}
{"text":"The mozzarella salad is awesome, our server recommended we split it. We had enough left over to split a take home portion for $8.50
I had my favorite the small penne diavalio. Again take home a good potion. I eat until I'm full and I was full. My companion ordered her favorite, the stuffed spinach shells. You can forgo the meatball and get a third shell. Finished off w espresso and tieramisu.
Almost forgot... the bread is excellent, light and fluffy rolls a little smaller than  the size of a softball. 
Great Italian food and good prices.
Didn't have the wedding soup this visit but order it if you go."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times.  Two of them were with the same waiter whom is awful!  Had my order wrong the first time; got my food when everyone else was done ( no comp.).  Tonight, forgot part of our order, realized after the fact and re-ran our card instead of comping the French fries that he forgot for $1.50. They need to upgrade their staff.  Can't imagine how many orders were wrong and not comped besides our 2 out of 3"}
{"text":"If you're reading this, you're probably wondering what you should eat for your next meal. The bottom line is, I've been eating at one of their establishments for 20+ years, and you can't go wrong here. I have never had a complaint in 20 years. 

Now, keep reading for more specifics. 

I've been in the Army for 17 years. This is usually my first, middle, and last stop for food while I'm in the Pittsburgh area. It doesn't matter which establishment we go to (Irwin, Murrysville, Penn Hills), my wife and I always get awesome food. My family that lived here always goes here as well - not just for dinners but for catering as well. 

Generally, I get the best cheesesteak in the area (excellent bread - which makes or breaks a sandwich) as well as rigatoni (and I add sausage on top of the meatballs). My wife usually gets the chicken parm sandwich. My sister gets spaghetti or stuffed shells. My mom gets various things. My dad always gets Diavlo. My grandmother always gets pasta. I live in Hawai'i and I can tell you I would love to have these prices for food! Very reasonable! We had essentially five meals plus drinks for $55. That's incredibly inexpensive in my opinion. 

We always have good food and great service. The owners are absolutely fantastic and are so passionate about the menu, the service, and the food. If you ever have an issue you should absolutely talk to either Dom or Vince. I will guarantee you my paycheck that they will make any situation right if you have an issue. Consider that before leaving a review - I don't have any kickbacks or anything. I don't live here. But trust me when I tell you that it's the best way to go. 

I hope if you've gotten to the end of this review you have already decided to order or go eat here. I would. I just left again :)"}
{"text":"I found a new restaurant I haven't tried in my area! That is rare because I've eaten at all places on Golden Mile Highway now...

Place has a parking lot and clean, modern decor. I liked the layout and the style but the smell was really stuffy and cheesy. There are certain smells of Italian cooking that I like (peppers, sausage, fennel, oils) but stinky cheese is not one of them. Unfortunately, this place reeked of this musty, sour cheese. The hubs is obsessed with all cheese so he didn't even notice it!

I ordered the carbonara and hubs ordered the seafood linguine. I was really craving some eggy, peppery dish with pancetta. It was good but not seasoned enough. I added a lot of salt and red pepper flakes to spice it up. Hubby's dish had 2 shrimp, 2 clams, 2 mussels and a tiny octopus so I guess it was varied. Portions are reasonable and there is free bread (yay!). 

Our waiter was nice and we'll probably be back now that we know it's here!"}
{"text":"Pasquilinos recently moved further down 22 in murrysville.   We enjoyed going to the smaller restaurant before they moved, so when they moved to a larger, newer location I had a couple of thoughts.  First I figured prices would go up, not the case.  The new location is nice, with a similar staff, and the same great food I was used to ordering.

Hoagies are great.  So are the salads.  Pizza is decent as well.  My favorite thing to order is their ca lzone or strombolli they are huge, awesome, and reasonable.   Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great Local Italian eatery, great food at cheap price.

This place is a lot better than any of the standard chain restaurants around.   The complimentary rolls are homemade and authenticate (nice hard crust with soft tasty middle).

Sandwiches are huge.  I got the roast beef on ciabatta bread, and half of it was enough to fill me up.

The homemade lasagnas is plate sized and flavorful.  I always dislike when a place overload  lasagna with ricotta cheese, and this place didn't fall into that trap.  I would recommend trying this is you like lasagnas.

TLDR: Great local place that deserves some love."}
{"text":"We order from this location quite often for game day take out and have always enjoyed the quality and value of their meals. 

Today, we ordered our regular game day meal of family spaghetti and meat balls and hoagies. We got home and opened the family spaghetti aluminum pan to find that the spaghetti pasta portion was 1/2 of what we normally receive. The meatballs were fine but the rolls were also cut down to 4 rolls from six. 

We could understand cutting back on the meatball size or number but cutting the pasta portion in half doesn't make sense. 

The quality and flavor are still great but having the pasta portion cut in half makes this \"family pasta meal\" a terrible value."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice and relaxing, we sat at the bar and enjoyed our beers. Tony Janflone started at 8:00. He is really good. The food was ok. The menu descriptions are a little off.  My husband had penne sautéed with bacon in a vodka sauce. There were two teeny tiny bits of bacon. I had penne with tomatoes and zucchini, baked with ricotta cheese. It had very little ricotta.  Not bad just not what we expected."}
{"text":"I've already written a review of what I will call Pasqualino's I. This is Pasqualino's II, located in Murrysville on route 22, about 25 minutes from the father restaurant. And that is precisely the relationship between the two places! Papa Pasqualino runs the Penn Hills restaurant while his sons run the other two (there is another in Irwin I have yet to visit). 

Many things are the same. The most important of which is the sweet, delectable marinara sauce. You will be happy that almost every pasta dish is smothered in it because you will want to use the complimentary rolls for dipping. All locations sell jars of the stuff. Treat yo' self sometime and pick up some. 

Some things are different. P2 has a slightly larger menu with more pizza options including hand tossed, thin crust, and Sicilian. P1 only serves Sicilian. P2 also has a large full service bar. 

I love this place every bit as much as I love the father restaurant. It can get a bit crowded on weekends and service on those days can be slow. But usually it's a pleasant meal for EXTREMELY fair prices. 

I will note that P2 is moving to a new and larger location about a mile west on route 22. I am looking forward to it!"}
