{"text":"The eggs benedict here are the best I've ever had. The service is excellent and the baked goods are amazing as well. Thid is a great family-owned business that i highlh recommend."}
{"text":"Everyone here is really nice, but I can't say I've ever been wowed by the food. In fact, I've been here on three or four occasions, & each time the food has been decreasingly palatable. The last time I took a few bites of my food and ended up throwing it away. It was one of the weekend specials and it was disgusting. I've had similar dishes at other establishments in the past, so I was excited to have it. The chicharron was crispy and alternatively slimy. The flavor was not so good. I'll give another chance because they're nice folks & I think there's potential, but I don't know how many more goes I'm gonna give it."}
{"text":"My small children, husband and I had dinner there tonight and, oh my goodness, every bite was just deliciously perfect. We all tried each other's dishes, so here's my review: My husband had the \"baleadas\" (homemade tortillas, refried beans, avocado, eggs, cream, served with a type of pico de gallo), they were delicious. For our children we ordered their french toast (made with homemade bread, served with strawberries, blueberries, caramelized bananas and drizzled with this cream sauce that was just out of this world) and scrambled eggs (topped with cheddar cheese and served with fresh fruit). I ordered the \"Plato Tipico\" (rice and beans cooked from scratch in coconut milk, a soft plantain, a side of something like pico de gallo, and two large pieces of carne asada cooked with garlic that left me speechless). Their horchata was also very, very good! We want to go back and explore the rest of the menu. The staff was super friendly, the place is clean and roomy enough for my family of five. Restrooms were clean as well. We're definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This bakery is amazing, loads of great items. I had the eggs Benedict - wow, the best hollandaise I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Best Central American food in Madison. The owners are Latin, so you have to ask them for the \"hidden menu\" since these plates are not listed. I've only been once but will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"The food was OK but the service was awful! I went on Sunday for breakfast with son and maybe they didn't think they will have more costumers but they had . Most of the people like to have breakfast outside on sundays, so they should have think about it. There were just two people for 20 around. They save my food after 25 minutes and my son's milk at the last. I didn't have a good time !"}
{"text":"Eclair dry and crumbly till I actually hit the custard portion. Almost choked on it. Started coughing but hit custard and I was ok. Noticed as I purchased it , they removed the tray which still had several on it. Very telling. Daughter had the mint brownie another mediocre concoction. Workers were very pleasant but cant say I would stop in here again."}
{"text":"OMG the breakfasts here are wonderful including my husband's crepes which he gets almost every time, the veggie breakfast burrito, and the Eggs Benedict. The scones are to die for. This is Monona's undiscovered foodie treasure."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Don't let the bakery cases fool you, the egg dishes were amazing!  I had both the crepes and the veggie burrito and both were incredible!!"}
{"text":"This neighborhood storefront cafe has fresh and delicious sandwiches.  I had their pesto bacon sandwich-- pesto, bacon, fresh mozzarella, thick slices of tomato and arugula on multigrain bread; my wife had an equally good tuna salad sandwich. The rest of their menu looks equally delicious. Pleasant and bright atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here after being disappointed with Rosie's and was very pleased with cinnamon roll and wonderful customer service at counter, thank you."}
{"text":"The eggs Benedict are delicious. Lemony hollendaise covering perfectly poached eggs bacon and asparagus on a croissant. Yum!"}
{"text":"The breakfast tacos were incredible! Cute little diner with generous portions and great service. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We we're staying in Madison and water a good breakfast. Found them on Yelp and decided to try it out. We we're not disappointed. Good food, friendly staff. You should definitely go here. The food is very good."}
{"text":"I love this place! Family-run, fresh ingredients, clean-no-frills space, friendly service, and delicious food at great prices. My girlfriends and I just met there for lunch. My breakfast tacos were amazeballs, and my girlfriends' chilaquiles and scramble also got high reviews. We also ordered pupusas to take home - holy crap they looked and smelled fantastic. Their bakery is also terrific. This will be our new go-to place for casual, tasty breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Went their first for their morning buns - which hands down are THE best in Madison.  Like former Ovens of Brittany.  Had items not on their menu, pupusas, and balenos - excellent!  Yum for brunch off their Latin menu.  Which you have to ask them about.  They do a lot of American food, and it's like a front for Honduran food that is wonderful.  Hope to see a Latin menu soon.  Update:  I've had their Plato Topico, traditional food and it was delicious!  Never had rice and beans made with coconut milk before- OMG good!  Enchiladas are also excellent!!  I've stopped for sandwiches and salads and never have been disappointed!  This is now my go to restaurant when looking for bakery or good simple meals!"}
{"text":"You have to ask for the pupusas. No, literally, you have to ask for them, because they are fucking good. I'm not sure why they don't appear on the menu, but those of us in the know ask for them. Those of us who want to show off ask for them in spanish. I don't care how you do it, but you really should ask for them. Plus, yuca fries are tasty. Dammit. Why do I only have a crappy sandwich for lunch at work today?  Fuck that."}
{"text":"We have gone into this place twice now.... So far we are pretty impressed!! I had their breakfast tacos the first time. The eggs were very flavorful and their salsa has really good heat to it! The second time I got their Eggs Benedict... it is definitely not traditional eggs Benedict but I did really like it. It is served on a croissant and with asparagus, YUM. my husband wanted to try the salmon omelette when we were there but they were out of salmon, so that was a bummer.... but he also enjoyed his meal both times. Since it's so new there's not a ton of sit-down business in there yet but there was a ton of traffic for their bakery. We are yet to try their baked good but I heard some folks raving about them. I like that they have a water cooler out with cups so you can help yourself to water. They do need to work on watching their coffee levels though, they ran out twice while we were there and didn't have backup done, it had to be made... Not cool when I want my coffee! Overall we are impressed enough that we will stop back again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late Sunday brunch.  We had the chilaquiles, papusa, chorizo taco, and Honduran tamale.  Nice price, friendly service.   The food was so good!   We will be back. If you haven't checked out this little gem you are truly missing out.  Nice flavors and big servings."}
{"text":"Honduran food, if you know to ask for it! The best, homemade from real ingredients. Check online for daily specials and ask them about their everyday items.  Yummy pastries too!"}
{"text":"New charming eatery in Monona. I came in for breakfast and was not disappointed. Service at the counter was friendly. The eggs Benedict while not traditional was that much more delicious for it (croissant, bacon, asparagus, poached eggs, bearnaise sauce) with a side of breakfast potatoes. The pancakes where heavy and the fruit sweet and delicious. I would recommend stopping in. I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Recently had breakfast with friends on a Saturday morning- everything was outstanding.  Very difficult to narrow down what to have as every item sounds better than the one before.  Friend had the crepes with berries- both beautiful and delicious. I had the mushroom and Swiss scramble and it was outstanding. We all agreed that we will be back!  And bring more friends and family next time.Yum!"}
{"text":"We were on the hunt for breakfast tacos, and this little gem popped up in our search. They were excellent! Chorizo and eggs and feta in corn tortillas with two fantastic sauces. The spinach omelette was also REALLY YUMMY. Fresh spinach, mushrooms and Cherry tomatoes sautéed together. The egg was fluffy and perfectly seasoned, folded over the spinach mix and packed with feta. Perfect. Served with potatoes, and some amazing French bread. Super soft and delicious, with zero need for butter or jelly. We also had a tamarind drink, and an horchata- which was a bit sweet for my taste. The bakery case drew us in and we got a brownie and a cherry cream cheese turnover to go. It definitely was a difficult choice that we debated about throughout our breakfast. Honduran items on the lunch menu looked very enticing, and we will for sure be back to try lunch (+ a chocolate eclair)!"}
{"text":"Decent gem in Monona. From the name, I did not know that they were a Honduran family owned place. I felt super guilty because we ordered two sandwiches, which strayed away from the traditional food and did not get any bakery items. They were delicious sandwiches though, but a little pricey for just a sandwich.   We had the Pesto Bacon Sandwich and the TBA (turkey bacon avocado). They were both delicious (but that might be because you can't go wrong with fresh bread and bacon). I personally enjoyed the Pesto Bacon sandwich more and would recommend it.   I recommend at least checking this place out once."}
{"text":"Deliciousss!!! Muy rica comida. Excelente popusas y los sabores son muy exclusivos. The bakery have different options"}
{"text":"Best crepes ever. I'm not a fan of ricotta cream cheese centers but this was amazing! Fresh fruit, raspberry coulis, & creme anglaise drizzled on top. I thought it would be too sweet but instead it was perfection.  I grasped their paper menu & will keep returning until I try nearly every item. It was that good. Also met their daughter Wendy about 16 going on 25.  Fun to talk to someone so mature & well thought out for her age."}
{"text":"This place is going to be my new neighborhood go-to. We sampled the chilaquiles, bean and cheese pupusas, a baleada, scrambled eggs off the kids menu (super cheap!) and a vanilla concha. The concha hit it out of the ballpark. I used to live 5 min from US Mexico border and this concha was orgasmically good!  The pastry was plush, fresh and delicious! The chilaquiles were unique, as they are served with feta, which is not typical, but makes sense as an alternative to queso cotija.  The pupusas were enormous and simply well done; the curtido was fantastic. I'm so happy that this place opened up. It's great for brunch, as it's menu is more breakfast/brunch/lunch.  Great cafe, I hope it stays open because I'm addicted!"}
{"text":"Great little bakery with all fresh authentic ingredients. The bene and breakfast tacos were amazing."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!! Locally owned by a wonderful couple that bring the Mexican and Honduras flair to American Food. Not only is there food for everyone's taste buds, but you can see the beautiful painting from Honduras that the wife has created :) Definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Second time here and still not impressed, to be fair, I'm only getting the baked goods to go. The decor needs to be dressed up a little bit, switch out the display trays etc to charge $5.25 for a ham croissant. I asked for the croissant to be warmed up, which he microwaved! Gross- should have been warned in the oven because instead of crispy, it was soggy. I got barely any ham & cheese. Terrible taste, won't be back, too bad because it's one of its own in Monona."}
{"text":"I have been bypassing this restaurant and finally made time for it a few weeks ago. I'm glad I did! A great place to sample Honduran food (plantains YUM) and the owners are very sweet. We went for some traditional breakfast dishes and really enjoyed them. I did mine sort of a la carte and that worked well for a small appetite.Go here for a meal made with love and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Cute little casual cafe with insanely delicious food! It's seems like everything is homemade (I'm pretty sure it all is) The breakfast tacos- omg yum -the salsa they give you is probably some of the best I've had... literally came back the next day for brunch!"}
{"text":"Les daría 5 sólo que les falta un poquito más de higiene para que no salgan cabellos grandes entre la carne,el sazon está delicioso cuando se esmeran, me encantan las tajadas de platanos,los pasteles de tres leches,el pan,y los  precios de  la comida razonable,no como en otros lugares,quería hacerles una solicitud y ver si pueden ir metiendo la salsa  guasaca venezolana,Patacon pisao y el mojito en coco,como el de la taguara sólo que ahí dan todo bien caro y la muchacha que atiende es muy mal educada,sin embargo ustedes son muy amables,siempre atienden al cliente como se debe ,excelente servicio y comida!"}
{"text":"I had the chocolate croissant - every bit as good as the ones I loved in Paris! My friend had a flaky crust type sandwich and loved it also. 2 other ladies in the place were happy too. Reasonably priced for the area and quality."}
{"text":"The friendliest people! I've only tried one menu item- the eggs Benedict-- and it's pretty darn good! Their pastries and sweets are really good too!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far on weekends to pick up baked goods in the morning. Both times, I found the food to be very expensive and underwhelming.   Today, I bought a croissant stuffed with ham and Swiss. It was not very flaky and had a small portion of the meat/cheese filling. It was not very good and cost $5.25. Even for a really good croissant, that is way too expensive.   I'm hesitant to come back again. The lunch sandwiches sound good but are priced at around $10.   The staff was very nice but I feel like the display area and genera decor of the restaurant is lacking."}
{"text":"Friendly staff , a bit on the pricey side but quality food. Very good bakery ! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The name is misleading--but in a good way. I assumed I was going to a bakery/café, but this place is way better than just that. I ordered breakfast tacos and beans/rice, and I was both surprised and happy with what I received. The tacos were in corn tortillas, and the combination of eggs and chorizo was perfect. It came with a little cup of green salsa that was amaze. The rice and beans were not what I expected. They tasted like they were made with coconut milk, and they were the best rice and beans I've had in a long time. So good. Topped with avocado slices and pickled red onions. I put both the avocado and the onion on my tacos, and I was a happy lady. My meal was so good, and just what I needed after a long trail skate.   There is one thing I would change about my visit, though. I paid almost $10 for a huge slice of tuxedo cake, and when I dug into it when I got home it was stale. SO MUCH DISAPPOINT. Keep the bakery in your cases fresh, guys."}
{"text":"I think I came here too late in the day because most of the baked goods were gone! I came around lunch time, and picked up a slice of tuxedo cake. It was perfectly chocolate and cakey.  It was so delicious. It was so delicious that I was excited about eating it so I decided to eat while in the car. Then I abruptly had to stop at a red light because it was yellow and I had not committed to speeding through even though I should have. Physics took over and caused my cake to fall off the seat of my car onto the floor of my car. Normally this wouldn't phase me, but I go to the barn a lot where there are horses, so my car is disgusting.  I'm very upset about my cake. I will be back for another one. I am sorry this was more of a lamentation of my loss of my partially eaten cake, but the dismay should show how much this cake meant to me."}
{"text":"I had the Eggs Benedict this morning, it was FABULOUS!!! The crescent was light and flakey, and their Hollandaise sauce is completely unique, they add a hint of lemon! The staff was very friendly and courteous. The place clean and bright. They are on my list for new favorite places!!"}
{"text":"OMG! The pupusas are like heaven in my mouth. Seriously if you want to have a taste of the real, this is the way my abuelita used to make it, Latinoamerican plates and desserts you have to eat here.   The staff is super friendly and will be glad to hear you practice your poor Spanish if you feel brave enough :)   So just get in the car. Drive here. And stuff your face with the staff's dessert recommendations."}
{"text":"We just left! Service was great! Food was yummy! Can't wait to eat our danish tomorrow!! Also, check out one of the owners story telling thru painting. Really outstanding!"}
