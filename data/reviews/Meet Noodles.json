{"text":"I'm a foodie, and have tried a variety of different noodles places, whether it was on vacation Asia or here in Toronto, this is by far the best Asian noodles I have ever had! The spices and tastes are amazing, and most importantly it's not over priced at all!!! If it's your first time try Pea & Minced Pork."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, delicious noodles, friendly and efficient service. Definitely recommend the place."}
{"text":"This place is great. Really authentic Chinese noodles. Very popular! Great prices. You should try it."}
{"text":"So happy I found this restaurant! I've visited twice in the past month, and each time has been a good experience. The restaurant is new/clean, in an accessible location off the QEW. Service is quick but quiet. They accept credit card.   Now onto the FOOD! For a cheap and good eat, try the Chongqing noodles ($5.50). You can order them in soup or dry, and in varying levels of spice and \"numbness.\"   Our group also ordered the pork belly noodles, seafood noodles, bubble tea and dessert. All were well proportioned, flavourful, and filling.   Have already recommended to friends, and am posting this review to support the local business."}
{"text":"Noodles taste amazing!!! Used to drive all the way long to Markham for Sichuan noodles, now I found an even better one in Mississauga! The soup tastes so great, not over salty. You won't feel thirsty at all after. You can ask for less spicy too. + Great service and comfortable environment! Definitely should try!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Vancouver, where we have mostly Japanese ramen, this place is outstanding. Chinese flavors are very prominent in the dish, the pork belly in the dish was amazing.   I asked for spicy, and the spiciness level was just outstanding, perfect in every way. The addition of peanuts in the bowl was nice.   I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Good place to meet and meet some noodles, try the meat noodles.   Very clean and modern decor, a little low on staff but food came out super quick."}
{"text":"This was hands down the best noodle bowl I have tried in a while. Both my sister and I thoroughly enjoyed the dishes we had gotten (she got the noodles with marinated pork belly and I had the noodles with beef sirloin). Plus not only the food was great, but the service was very quick. We got our food in about 10 min... however we were there around 10:00p...so busy times may result in longer wait times. However, all in all, it is definitely worth it!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and spacious. The staffs are friendly. I like how they put a slice of lemon in the water its very refreshing.   I ordered tomato beef noodle soup. The portion was huge lots of noodles, the beef was pretty soft. However, I find it way too oily. I know most of Chongqing food is a bit oily but my soup is basically covered by oil. And there was no tomatoes in the soup.   I dont know if I will come back. Overall, I dont hate this place. Service was great, restaurant was clean, portion was decent, and it was tasty. Unfortunately, I cant handle oily food."}
{"text":"Great chinese noodle place in the area. Hidden gem. So glad i found this place! Definitely coming back again"}
{"text":"Modern noodle house with excellent traditional choices. Family run with great service. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place serves Chinese noodles and side dishes at a decent price, with the spicy versions of the noodle soups rightfully named so. The portions are generous, and with prices of the noodle bowls ranging from $6.50 to $12, this place is definitely a place I'll be returning. Each noodle bowl have the option of being spicy, with Chinese flavours coming through well in both the soup and the meat. Soups are also dressed in peanuts, sesame seeds, and coriander, which worked well with the flavours in the meat. Service is prompt and quick, though some tables could use a better wipe-down in between customers. Cash, debit, and credit are all accepted."}
{"text":"Ordered a spicy ground pork noodle in soup.  Noodles: good texture, flavor, quantity.  Meat topping: included peanuts! Sauce base is spicy bean paste. The chickpeas were a bit random, but i liked it! Garnishes: Bok Choy  Result: Simple, pure, delicious. Also conveniently near the highway. Would come again anytime, probably every time I pass by from working in the west."}
{"text":"Great noodles! Very good flavour and spicy and not salty. A large portion with lots of noodles and pork belly. Will defintely be full. A Hidden gem!! Must try!"}
