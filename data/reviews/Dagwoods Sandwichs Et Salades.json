{"text":"Dagwoods is my go-to-place for a good fresh sandwich whenever I come to Montreal.  I ordered my usual: 6\" Turkey / Brown Bread / Toasted / Dagwood sauce / Vegetables  The combination of all these ingredients makes the sandwich melt in my mouth. There's an explosion of freshness from the vegetables, crunchiness from the bread, and sweetness from the sauce.   I love it!"}
{"text":"Never again...I like the other St-Charles location in Kirkland and the one on des Sources but the staff here are absolute  spoiled brats. My wife was treated like a second class citizen, my daughter was traumatized and the employee called the police because she thought someone called her a name. I feel bad for business owners who have to deal with entitled employees who always feel that you are a hindrance more than a customer. My whole family loves Dags but will never go to this location ever again. P.S.-love the Dags sauce :)"}
{"text":"So, imagine Subway. Only the meat is so fresh they cut it for you right there with a grocery-store type slicing machine. There is a variety of sandwiches, you can get it grilled for free, and they have cut down toppings to the ones that make sense. Add a little of their special sauce and away you go.  Make no mistake, there is nothing outlandish about these subs. But at $5-7, it's really good and has totally obliterated any reason for me to go to a Subway or Quizno's ever again."}
{"text":"Dagwoods was always #1 but not anymore. It's no wonder these places go out of business eventually.  We ordered two 1/2 subs.. The bread wasn't that fresh (or toasted) and the meat (all three slices) was sliced as thin as paper.  What a complete let down! There's a reason subway is taking over the market.  It's great you (the owner) is making more money by slicing the meat so thin but believe me, I will never eat a dagwoods sub again.  It amazes me these places aren't monitored for quality control.  Shame on you Dagwoods!!! If I could rate a 0 that's where this place is.  Prices are ridiculous for what you get."}
{"text":"Best sandwich made fresh not subway fresh , fresh fresh, this is my favorite sandwich place , soooooo good and no guilt involved because it's not junk food! Though I prefer the Sherbrooke w location more simply because it's less busy and more relaxing"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Dagwoods, it's like subway but 1000 x better I still don't understand how people eat subway blows my mind taste like dog food.  You can pick from white or brown buns or subs.  They cut the meat In front of you which is something that will never happen at subway.  They have 3 sauces to pick from typical I choose Dagwoods because it's original and the best :) spicy for all you crazy people lol.  They have a stamps card so after you buy a few sandwiches you can either get free chilling or sub depending on how many you get.  The chili is something you'll wanna try as well. Thank me later !"}
{"text":"Always been a fan. Grew up in the west, everyone knows Dagwood. I do the Dagwoods sandwich or the roast beef sandwich. Spicy Dagwoods sauce is awesome. They have a kids menu which I really like, so are the little ones. Made fresh to order, good toppings. You can taste the difference. Very reasonable prices. If you haven't tried Dagwoods before I don't know what you're waiting for, this kills Jared's spot..."}
{"text":"This is actually a review of Dagwoods' Laval location but I imagine they're quite similar.   It was eerily like Subway but fewer choices of toppings. They did slice the cheese which is a plus but not enough to offset the mediocre taste. It was serviceable for getting a sandwich to go but definitely would not stop there again."}
{"text":"I never in 20 years or more (the time the Dagwoods chain has been open), thought I would be giving a low rating to one of my favourite freshly made sandwich shops.   PLEASE NOTE: This review does not indicate anything about their other locations or chain overall and I've been a 5 star fan since the beginning.   This location has been giving me, 'a not so good feeling' on several visits - the latest in particular. I went to pick up a large Dagwoods Club (which is sliced Turkey, Ham and Roast Beef), to share and a bag of Sun Chips (tasty as always). I noted right away that the Roast Beef looked different (even sickly) and that it never did look like that before. The meats in general where pretty weak and then the toppings, yikes, what a mess - literally - they ended up more on the counter than on the bread. I felt like I should let them go to waste so I asked for them in a container on the side. I could not believe that the counter person pushed them in with a used j-cloth type thing (I dumped them in the bin a few minutes later).   One more (OK, two more) thing and then I will end this review, as I am rarely this negative on a place. One is that the bread which is 'baked fresh in store', tasted half stale and half blast toasted - either way not nice.   Finally, and this may explain alot, this store is supposedly a franchise, yet I never see the owner there. The counter staff are alright, but don't seem to have any real guidance like other Dagwoods shops, where the staff are usually top. I don't want to 'rant' in any way shape or form, but something should be done to tweak this up.  PS I happened to see another review of this location written in 2012, that pretty much mirrors my sentiments. PPS Darn, one last thing - the prices for the large I got was $8.99 before tax. Is there really that much inflation?"}
{"text":"Is it a little cheesy to write an open love letter to a sandwich and salad restaurant? I guess a 'like letter' will have to do.  I don't want to date myself, but if they are in there 25th year of business, let's say I've hankered for freshly prepared Dagwoods' sandwiches on their freshly (made in house) sub rolls, layered up the way I like - all dressed with every sliced and diced topping, yet light on the onions, plus mayo on the top, some 'bac-o-bits', pepper and of course 'THE' Dagwoods' sauce of sauces - for over two whole decades.   That was a mouthful to get out on digital paper, but like the satisfying taste of a well built and well served meal, it's well worth it. Did I mention they have some of the best (quick serve) service I've ever had, especially over the years at this location (many of their now 21 locations have the Dags' culture instilled upon them, but I guess I have my leanings).  These days, classic chalkboard clad menus/décor have been replaced by digital flat screens - yet as long as the sauce recipe (seriously guarded from what I hear) stays the same we're all good. In fact they'd probably get a 5 on the sauce alone. I have even on occasion drunk a small container of it.  Is it time I hugged a Dagwoods' sandwich? Maybe next visit.  PS When everything is just right, it really is a 5 star treat.  PPS I order catering about a year back and was a pleasure to deal with the owner, who appreciated my/our loyalty."}
{"text":"J'allais commencé mon avis et j'ai réalisé que c'était quasiment Mot pour mot la même chose que Richard K a écrit en anglais!  C'est vrai! C'est un Subway mais meilleur, plus frais et moins chimique.  Il y a aussi les boissons gazeuse Stewart's qui sont très bonne qu'on retrouve là-bas, une de mes Root beer favorite. Ils ont aussi des menus du jours moins cher et la différence entre ceux de Subway c'est que c'est tous ce bon sandwich! Si c'était plus proche du travail, j'irais beaucoup plus Souvent.   Échelle de la fraicheure et des produits moins chimique dans l'ordre du plus naturel  Dagwoods --- Quiznos --- Subway."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Dagwoods. It's like the watered down and budget version of Subway. You get just as much as toppings as Subway and have your meat toppings sliced in front of you which is pretty cool. I like the prices at Dagwoods and everything on the menu seems under 5 bucks for a 6 inch sub. This place would be perfect for students or people with low income.   Soups and Chilis are also offered at Dagwoods which I like. The trio combo at Dagwoods are cheap also. Overall, I like Dagwoods."}
