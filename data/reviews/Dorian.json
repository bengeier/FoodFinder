{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious happy hour with $5 house cocktails and $5 Appetizers. Buffalo Trace Manhattan along with bacon wrapped dates, poached pear deliciousness and great service made for a nice start to the evening. We'll be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"My son and wife and I went on a Tuesday evening and it wasn't too busy but that's to be expected. It is Tucked away off of Scottsdale road but we had a fabulous time. The restaurant has a very cool feel to it and Angel our server could not have been better. She had a very comforting and sweet presence about her  that we would almost go back just for the service!  But the food was fabulous (the crispy salmon was great) and I would definitely go back ...the cocktails were a homerun as well !!"}
{"text":"I hate it when I have such an amazing experience and then I feel a deep responsibility to review them. The reason being, once the rest of Scottsdale knows about Dorian's, it will certainly be impossible to get a reservation without  notice.
We love discovering new  and my daughter found Dorian s. The decor is sleek, elegant yet has a sense of fun and a European funky vibe.  The aqua crush velvet booths and the royal blue upholstery accent pieces against the lightness of the creamy walls, sofa frame and marble tables  played beautifully beneath the nearly gothic crystal chandeliers. A feast for the eyes before we even order a thing. Did I mention the magnificent angel statue that watches over the bar?
Then we ordered. We started with the best salad I have ever had, baked avocado and grapefruit salad over a bed of arugula. It was simple yet so flavorful, and the thing I have issue with-it was perfectly dressed!!! Take a page from Dorian's  restaurants. Do not drown your creations with dressing. My daughter had the beet salad with soy glazed walnuts and again, perfection! I had the salmon that sat on a bed of pur√©ed squash and brussels sprouts. The salmon was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, cooked to perfection! My daughter had the  bistro steak sliced served with gratin potatoes and fresh asparagus. Both dishes were so exceptional, there was no sharing. We cleaned our plates and left no room for the blueberry cheesecake in a jar. Next time. We also shared a bottle of Rose, they only had one on the menu but that was all that was necessary. The service was excellent and I appreciate all the attention to details that makes Dorian's a force in the dining industry to be reckoned with! We recommend you go now before you are waiting two weeks or longer for a reservation."}
{"text":"This my new favorite spot in Old Town.   Classy, lounge with style and flair.  The food and drinks were fantastic, the vibe was cool and fun. My friends and I loved it. Talk about details, the artwork, decor, this place hit the sweet spot!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was spot on! Perfect place for a date night, girls night, or just really any dinner night.  Service was fantastic and food was really, really good. The wine selection was great!  I will definitely be returning and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a place for dinner. Don't forget to take a fun picture on the Dorian couch! #Doriancouch"}
{"text":"What an absolutely lovely new addition to the Scottsdale dining scene! 
We stopped in last weekend for a quick nibble and a cocktail and were pleasantly surprised by the whole experience - beautiful decor, hip vibe, professional service and tasty cocktails and nibbles.  I thoroughly enjoyed  The Madam and the roasted pears with goat cheese on toast - craveworthy, for sure!  I'll definitely be back to try the entire dinner menu next time."}
{"text":"Service was disappointing, NOT the quality of a fine dining restaurant. The service was rushed and pushing us to order. We ordered a bottle of wine and the server wanted us to order before bringing the wine. She did not know how to serve wine properly, struggling with the cork palms of hands on cork, no fork presentation, and poured half a glass of wine instead of a taste for the first pour. Poorly done. 

Food was a 3 star. Disappointing as well. Artificial liquid smoke flavor was used on appetizer and dessert. The salmon was fantastic and well plated. Check came BEFORE I even finished my dessert, had just started it. My appetizer plate was taken as my last bite was still in my mouth. Rushing us(and there were not many people there so business is not an excuse). 

The check was tallied incorrectly. I had to ask for a manager to get total corrected and be assured that taxed amount was on actual total versus the very confusing way it showed on receipt with poor explanation from waitress who clearly is not accustomed to serving wine.  Manager came and explained satisfactorily that the tax was tallied on total and gave an additional discount to account for tax. I appreciated the manager's explanation and making it right, however I had seen enough at that point: 
While it was restaurant week, we did order a nice bottle of wine and were not there being cheap. Much nicer meal at Citizen Public the other night at same price point and I will not comPare the Michelin starred place from last weekend.
BOTTOM LINE IS POOR SERVICE. Food is not impressive, especially for Scottsdale. 
Manager's comment about us being there \"almost three hours\" is incorrect, and correcting the bill took well over half an hour as there were several steps before I asked for manager."}
{"text":"If your into food- this is your spot! The chef at this location is absolutely amazing. Cocktails we spot on and freaking delicious. We tried it all and we talk about this place all the time now. 

We went during the week for a double date night. We were afraid it was going to be packed so we made a reservation. This place is posh with a little bit of sass. Ambience was perfect- lighting just right. And again the food was definitely a meal you will talk about even weeks later. 

Being a native Arizonian we have been to our fair share of \"foodie spots\" and this one takes the cake so far for us this year. When you pair perfect drinks, perfect ambience, and perfect food. You get a 5star review. It's a little on the pricey side but totally worth the splurge. When comparing to other spots in this area it's moderately priced. You won't regret stopping by this Diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"I mean, it's hard to review a place when they're closed well after their scheduled opening time at 3 pm.

Took my mom to PT down by Osborn hospital on a Tuesday and she was hungry afterward.  We saw this new place in yelp and we thought we'd check it out.  They were closed at least until 3:15 on Tuesday, January 30th, when we gave up and looked for something else.  At least it wasn't hot out.

Would love to actually try the place but would need to be assured it would be open.

ETA: To be sure, I wrote this review over the weekend, on a Sunday, but we visited on a Tuesday.  It's too bad the restaurant owner made an assumption in his reply (below) that we had visited when they were closed as this is not accurate."}
{"text":"Wow, what a gem! Small and beautiful, feels quaint with a fresh vibe and lovely decor. Staff was very attentive and nice. Appetizers and meals were exquisite and mouth watering. Heard they opened in January, but just now hear about it. Go there now! It's amazing!!!"}
