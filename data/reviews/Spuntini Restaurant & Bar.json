{"text":"I've been to Spuntini several times - for multiple occasions - over the course of let's say.. oh... 4 years?  When i went for my birthday (first time) it was AMAZING! The food tasted good and everything was fine. Service was good. Ambiance was just right.  I went another time for more of a romantic dinner. The service was good, but the food was not as good as I remembered.  I went the following year with friends again. I'm not sure if the cook changed but seriously their pasta was not as good as I remembered.   I probably won't return again if i had a choice. I don't hate the place, but it's nothing special. Rather spend my moola somewhere else."}
{"text":"My best friend was coming to Toronto to visit and we wanted to find somewhere in the area where we could sit, relax, and have some food.  My boyfriend found Spuntini's online and we decided to check it out after taking a quick look at their menu.  My friend had insisted that she probably wasn't going to eat much since she maxed out on Italian food over the weekend but upon arrival, she immediately wanted to try everything on the menu!  The atmosphere at Spuntini's is great!  The decor is cosy and elegant making you feel like you're right at home.  The food was amazing and the service was unbelievable!  Our waiter was so excited about the food on the menu and described each item on the specials perfectly. This friendly and professional demeanor was not limited to him alone as the dessert chef came out to discuss different options he would recommend for our desserts and became extremely excited and happy to see us enjoy his plates!  We've been there a few times since then and have always recommended it to friends and family.  By the way, their osso bucco is amazing!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Spuntini Saturday night. We are a family of four with two teenagers. We visit Toronto regularly so we aren't regulars but we always feel like it. The food was excellent, the service was wonderful and the experience has always been great. It's such a great setting. We go here every time time we are in Toronto. Highly recommend Spuntini. We may be spending more time in Toronto so this will clearly be a regular spot."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went there for our date. The food and the service was excellent. The choice of wine was overwhelming for someone who doesnt frequent an Italian restaurant.  Price was reasonable. Will be coming back again for sure"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good affordable Italian food in a ritzy neighbourhood with an intimate atmosphere, Spuntini is the place to go (and as evidenced by the many picture frames in the front hallway, this is also a popular spot for celebrities!). Great place for large groups but make sure you book early in advance (tried to make a reservation for 3 on a Sunday and could only snag a 5pm spot).  BUFALA MOZZARELLA - Vine Ripe Tomatoes, Fresh Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil And Balsamic Glaze - This came out with only 3 slices of tomato and 3 slices of cheese. Very aesthetically pleasing but quite a bit disappointed with the portion size (especially given its price tag). SPAGHETTI AMORE - Spaghetti Tossed With Strips Of Grilled Chicken, Roasted Red Peppers In A Sun Dried Tomato Pesto Cream Sauce - I've been here twice and gotten this dish both times! It is THAT good. TAGLIATELLE DEL MONTE - Tagliatelle Al Ovo Tossed With An Australian Lamb Tenderloin Ragout - Quite tasty and surprisingly not salty (which is usually my problem with lamb pastas)."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place - I really did but I just couldn't.    I came here for my birthday with a group of my lovely friends and I had high hopes after reading the fab reviews on Yelp but this place, from the minute I stepped in to the minute I left, was a great big disappointment.  First, when I arrived, it took over 15 mins to receive the bottle of wine we ordered.  Then when our waiter came back, he listed off the specials, and before we could even tell him we were ready to order, he disappeared for 30 minutes.  So from the time we sat down to the time he took our orders, it was a 45 min ordeal AND we were told when we reserved our table that we only had 2 hours to dine.    The food itself wasn't bad but eating in a place where service was terrible and constantly being pushed by the waiters due to the tight space compromised the dining experience.  I was extremely disappointed by the overall experience especially after reading Yelp reviews.  I will not be going back.    *Side note, we tipped the way we were served... which was pretty badly.  That somewhat helped make an extremely awful experience to just awful (nixed the extreme!)"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant through Google searched and Yelp and I am soooo glad I did! I came here during my trip to Toronto with my fiance and we had dinner here to celebrate our engagement. The hotel made a reservation for us for 8pm and we got there about 10 minutes early to find a PACKED lobby/bar area. We checked in with the host, and were told we would have to wait about 20 min for our table. This was not a huge deal, but slightly annoying since we had a reservation and were really hungry from the long drive. At least we had all the celebrity pics on the wall to keep us entertained. We were seated after waiting about 45 minutes.   We got a good spot in the corner and the ambiance was really cute and romantic. Our waiter was great and pretty attentive. The menu was pretty extensive and every dish sounded amazing; it was tough to pick what to order. I decided on a wild mushroom risotto (I have been on a major risotto kick lately) and my fiance ordered a lamb dish. We were served some delicious bread with a white bean hummus that was really tasty. It was tough to stop eating that bread, but I knew I didn't want to be full before the risotto came!   Our entrees came out steaming hot and were soooo delicious. My fiance's lamb was cooked perfectly and so was my risotto. Everything was great and we were very pleased. The portions were pretty big, so I didn't even come close to finishing mine, but I sure tried!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and great service. Lamb was average, think you can get better, gnocci outstanding, and the seafood platter for two (main) was out of this world.   the service was unbelievable. highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Thanks, Yelp, for putting me onto this. All that was advertised and more. Great, I mean exceptional pasta and meat, fish dishes. I would not hesitate to go here again."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for booking group dinners, for business especially! Not only is the food great quality, but you can't beat the service here. The team at Spuntini has always been extremely accommodating for even our last minute bookings. Highly recommend it for all events: date night, birthdays, or clients!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants for Italian food. Although it is located in Yorkville, the menu offers a variety of pasta, pizza, and entre selections for various price ranges that borders on affordable to high end. I've been there three times for dinner for business and the place has great ambiance and service.   I recommend making reservations if you plan to have dinner. Also, if you are going to order wine, be prepared to pay the price.   We typically get the seafood and grilled vegetable platter as apetizer. Their breads are fresh and very tasty.  The first time I ordered the lobster tail, the second and third time I ordered the lamb. The lamb came with a side of funghi rizotto. The food doesn't disappoint.  Overall, I think its a high end place which doesn't have the high end formal feel and the big price tage. But since the waiters are paid by tips, they are much happier the more you order.  For a fine dining, this is probably my first choice over all the others I have tried. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Bland bland bland bland!!! We went on a Saturday evening with another family. The service was extremely slow for salad and pasta dishes. They served a chick pea dip with their bread offering. The dip had no flavour other than that of a pasty chick pea spread.  We ordered an arugula salad with minimal tasteless dressing. The pasta dishes, to sum it up, had no distinctive flavour that would encourage you to take another mouthful. The sauce according to my son was less appetizing than what he had in preschool child care. My frutti Di mare pasta dish had a tasteless mix of what appeared to be boiled shrimp, clams and calamari with a marginal amount of undercooked linguini.  I must say that they had great water service at filling up our glass throughout the meal. Perhaps they should transfer some of this staff to help in the kitchen so service can be a little quicker. They also had a quick cleanup after we were done with our meal to get us out the door!    The only positive would be the decor (except for the dated curtains that act as dividers within the restaurant) and the proximity to Yorkville."}
{"text":"The service was mediocre.  Beef carpacio was great.  We ordered the seafood menu for two. It was not worth the $65 we paid. They burned pretty much all the seafood. The scallops had burned grill marks on them, as well as the salmon. The veggies that came with it were bitter and undertook in regards to the carrots and cauliflower.  I probably wouldn't go back again for the over $100 we spent."}
{"text":"For the record, food and wait staff were decent. Owner's attitude, however, was below par.  I took Mom to try out this restaurant on a Friday night. My boyfriend was expected to join us but got caught at work so my mom and I proceeded to order and dine. Food and service had been decent until the restaurant started to fill up. The next thing we know, my mom and I were asked the money question,   \"Is the other patron that you are expecting ordering a meal?\"  The answer to that was \"No, he will join us for drinks\" and we were then advised \"then sorry I can't send people away and must ask you to leave\", by the owner himself. Note now, we were not simply chatting and being ignorant about a busy Friday night. By then we have advised the wait staff that we would not wait and had ordered wine, appetizer, main course and were in the middle of working through the meal.  When we asked for an opportunity to express our disappointment on the abruptness on this intrusion, the owner had seemed annoyed and intended to teach us a lesson, \"This is how I run my business and I have been in it for 16 years.\"  We paid over $100 for 2 unfinished meal and a horrible \"lesson\" from an owner that does not care to hear what customers have to say respectfully."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant with tasty dishes and a very attentive staff (Mauricio).  Well worth the coin we dropped.  I only wish we had more places like this in Boston.  RUN to Spuntini!"}
{"text":"A bunch of friends got together to celebrate a very dear friend of mine. She has recently gotten married and moved from the the uk to toronto. Her husband threw her birthday bash here! Very posh restaurant that had very disrespectful people!! We were all surprised at the service we got at the end of the night! Before being seated we all were reminded of the time frame we have to eat!! Which kind of restaurant says that!! Anyways the night went well! The food was amazing!! Closer to the end of our dinner a server came with the bill and we all got out our payment method!   Now as we all waited for our payment cards to return some dude comes out of no where reminding us about the time and how there's another party waiting. My friend who booked the reservations politely said we are just waiting for our cards. So the server left. Then I guess the manager came and told us of how a there's an 85th birthday reservations waiting to be seated and that we should have finished eating and bills should have been taken care of before 9:30pm!!! EXCUSE ME!!! We all were like ummm what the hell!!! We were just waiting for our cards!! Anyways we all got our cards and made our way out!!! We will never eat at this place again!! Talk about a posh place and customer service!! To top it all he told my friend to take a card and he will take care of something the next time him and his wife have dinner there again!!! It was a pretty shitty way to end a birthday dinner!!   P.s the server brought out a cake piece with a candle and we all thought it was nice of them to do that... Little did we knew it was added to the bill!! LOL!!"}
{"text":"The main issue I have is the food is not very good - the bread is stale sliced whole wheat loaf, and the pizza crust tasted like it was from the freezer section. But they have lots of pictures of celebrities on the wall.  I would rather go to a number of sandwich joints like Ciccio Sanwiccio where they speak Italian AND also know how to cook Italian. Overrated. I wonder if they comp celebrities at these places?"}
{"text":"Wonderful neighborhood Yorkville. Spuntini's was a delight, my husband started with Parma Antipasto entree Capellini Forestiera.....tasty, ample serving, keenly priced @ $15.50. My starter, Arugula Parmigiano a little dry, lacked dressing but our waiter kindly obliged & promptly delivered to our table a wee bowl of extra saiad dressing. My entree Pollot[chicken] Ripieno stuffed w/ Proscuitto & Fontina Cheese served in a Creamy Tomato Pesto. @$27.00. Wld definitely recommend Spuntini's for food, ambience, price &  certainly location wonderful.  Yorkville a delight to take a stroll after dining safe, secure, clean & refreshing. FYI our waiter [mature grey haired jovial waiter] a delight. Just one drawback as far as I'm concerned...we were never infomed of his name. So wish restaurants staff would introduce themselves. Restaurant suitable for date night, couples, groups."}
{"text":"I have been to spuntini's now numerous times and i always come away impressed with its combination of good food, wine and very friendly, accommodative service and ambiance. Not sure why sotto, sotto attracts more stars ( as in hollywood) and girls from montreal but the people i talk to rate spuntini over it's neighbor below. Tonight i had the octopus starter on a bean salsa and while not a bean fan i do have to say the beans were a good compliment and very well done/tender. I then had the capellini forestiera with wild mushrooms, sundried tomatoes and spinach which was very good despite the assistant waiter dousing it with parmesan! Finished it off with an excellent tiramisu which is a \"normal\" tiramisu despite the menu attempt to describe it as something else (my waiter accurately told me to just ignore the description saying it was inaccurate although in less discrete terms than that!). Good, extensive wine list with some even good half bottle choices, hard to beat this place!"}
{"text":"I can see so many famous people and movie stars were here before. The environment is great so as the dishes. I love the way they use the bottled holder for decorating the restaurant and display how many good wine they have."}
{"text":"Overall it's very good food, with ambiance and service to make it a nice full-package experience.  The service is excellent with just the right attention to detail without being overbearing. The menu is moderately pricey, but it was all worth the price. This is not a quick meal - plan for Spuntini when you have time for the ambiance, the wine list and good conversation. Nice private areas for larger groups as well as small romantic tables. Have tried the grilled octopus app (tender and tasty), had bites of a couple of the salads (not swimming in dressing which is my biggest peeve), tried a few bites of several pasta dishes (all cooked perfectly and sauces were divine), and a sea bass that was cooked and flavored to perfection. You also can't beat the sardines if you crave salty and interesting. And the thin pizzas are not wimpy thin - nice heft without being too soggy.  I'd definitely go back with a large or small group."}
{"text":"My rating is actually 2.5/5  The service at Spuntini is spotty at best.  While our waiter was friendly, he was notably absent for a good chunk of the evening, and left us hanging when our water glasses needed replenishment. We had to flag him and several other staff throughout the night to make a point of it.  Our group of 5 ordered a Pizza to share as a starter. While it was pretty to look at, it quickly became apparent that the base of the pizza was pre-cooked, and lacking the flavour of freshly raised yeasty dough. The dominant flavour in our Quattro Fromaggio Pizza was that of mozzarella, the type you get in large bricks at the grocery store. Come on, really? The Pizza's description boasted the addition of Gorgonzola, Bocconcini, and Asiago. Those flavour profiles were most definitely missing.  I chose the Linguini Frutti di Mare as my main, as many bloggers and reviewers had recommended it. I found that while the seafood (Mussels, Jumbo Shrimp, Calamari, and Clams) were plentiful for the portion, that the entire dish lacked depth. A little extra seasoning, and a stronger seafood based would have helped it along greatly.  I had a taste of my friend's Rigatoni Portabello, and it was quite tasty. Though they didn't list Porcini as one of the ingredients in this dish, the deep earthy flavour of funghi permeated the plate. Great for mushroom fans.  The saving grace of dinner was dessert. The Tiramisu was light, and airy with just the right amount of coffee hit.  I was expecting a better experience for a restaurant located in Yorkville."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here originally as a fluke, but boy were we ever glad we did! We've been back a few times since and decided to celebrate our anniversary dinner here as well. Service was great! Ambience was perfect. Great place to have dinner/drinks with friends and catchup or to go on a romantic date with your sweetheart. Every single staff member that greeted/helped/served us was friendly, upbeat, made interesting conversation and made our experience at Spuntini enjoyable. Great wine selection as well! Perfect combo. Meat is always tender and flavourful and pasta is cooked just right!   Lovelovelove this place!  We will definitely keep going back! and recommending it to friends/family :) P.S. Totally craving some Spaghetti Amore!! (Simple but perfected each and every time!)"}
{"text":"4.5 stars....  I went twice in the last month:  for a big dinner as a group of 12 in early December, and as a twosome on new year's eve.   In both cases the dining experience was spot on.  The atmosphere is lively, noisy, and energetic:  it's refined, but not stuffy.  The service is excellent:  warm and inviting, but not too intrusive.    For the group, we asked the waiter to just bring a bit of everything, and so we got to try quite a few dishes.   Pasta, seafood, meat....everything was well-prepared, with quality ingredients.  The two waiters that took care of us did an excellent job, and there was never an empty glass or empty plate on the table.  For new years, even though it was a busy night, the service was prompt, efficient, and friendly.  The prix-fixe menu had a tremendous number of options, and what we selected was fantastic (from simple green salad, to smoked salmon, to grilled bass).    The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food, and the wine list has good options at a variety of price points.    A wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"After being  shafted at  Coco Lezzone last night, we went across the street to Spuntini. We told them what had happened and they welcomed us with open arms and ensured we were given a table right away.  They gave us complimentary champagne and kept checking on us throughout the entire evening. The food was phenomenal and cooked to perfection! We left a 30% tip because  they turned what would have otherwise been a ruined Saturday night, into a memorable and great evening out. I had been here once before and was very pleased. The walls of the restaurant are star-studded and that still does not stop them from showing proper etiquette and a warm heart to those who are not famous. I applaud the staff on a job well done and thank you immensely for saving the night! Id give  10 stars but 5s the max! :)"}
{"text":"Make a reservation or it will be impossible to get a table here. It was overwhelmingly crowded at first and was difficult to move around. The food was great though. The rigatoni was amazing. Get it!"}
{"text":"Went to this place based on Yelp reviews and it was excellent.  They have a nice selection on the menu.  I went with a seafood linguine and it was so good.  They didn't skimp on the seafood either.  The owner was very friendly and gracious."}
{"text":"The best Italian restaurant in Toronto.  I've been coming for 18 years and the experience is always incredible. The staff are truly friendly and make you feel like you're part of the family."}
{"text":"I came here for a group dinner earlier this month. I absolutely love the atmosphere of this place, it's very cozy and intimate. Great for a date or small group. Our menu was pre-fix. For starters I ordered the CARPACCIO DI MANZO. This was my first time trying this type of dish, but I thought it was excellent. For my entree I ordered the RAVIOLI DI SORAIA, which was meh. I wouldn't order it again. I had a hard time finishing it because it was so tasteless and bland. But for dessert, I had the tiramisu which was delicious, soft and fluffy. I would come back here if I was in the area, but I would make sure to order a different entree next time."}
{"text":"My friends and I had reservations to this restaurant for 7 of us for my friend's birthday. Upon arrival, since me and a few others arrived late and our other friends were already seated, we told the owner that we had reservations and were waiting to be seated, he said \"sure table for 7 right? i will be right back\". Not only did he not come back but we stood waiting there while other staff stared at us standing there and walked by without a word for several minutes. The birthday girl came out herself and took us to our seats. When we got to the table and began ordering our server had the worst attitude imaginable for no apparent reason. The service was horrible and the food was bland.  Other tables around us even had the staff sing their guests happy birthday and my friend was sitting there awkwardly because we told them it was her birthday and they did absolutely nothing. After this atrocious night, the server came back with 1 bill for 8 people for $260. When asked for seperate bills he said he could not provide us seperate bills as we were supposed to tell him that when we walked in. I have never heard of such a thing in my life. After some completely unnecessary bickering between this guy, he left for 20 minutes (made us purposely wait) and he finally gave us separate bills and told us he thought we werent going to tip him and if he did separate bills it would include tip. For a semi high end restaurant, you would expect decent service and food but it was several levels below decent. We were a respectful crowd and there was absolutely no reason for this horrible time. I've heard greats things about this place from friends so maybe this restaurant was having an off day but I am just explaining what happened as a first timer to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best itialian restaurant in the city. I'm from Toronto, and if you are here on a visit, make sure you dine here."}
{"text":"Wished my meal was as exciting as some of the reviews or even as exciting as the waiter made it out to be. I ordered the Ravioli and had to switch with a friend. While the food was okay, it wasn't crazy awesome. The place is tight. Service was really good though."}
{"text":"Best italian food in Toronto!  Well, there are lots of places, but this is up there if you like gourmet italian.  Pricey but worth it.  Dine with the Stars."}
{"text":"Was not satisfied with the service or the food. I came here with my family and friends and we did not enjoy the food and received unpleasant service. The wait for our food was absolutely ridiculous, no apology was given for the wait and the waiter was constantly coming to our table to refill our water. Our meals were in very small portions and priced high. When we were done our meal, they were very quick to take our money and send us out the door. Overall poor experience."}
{"text":"Peter and his entourage provide great attentive service, excellent food and a great wine collection.   If you don't see what you like, ask!  Wish I could go there every day!    Forgot to mention.....a great wine selection too!"}
{"text":"Celebrated a special event here with my lovely wife.  Our food was very good.  The service was excellent.  Why one star?  Chilean Sea Bass was offered as one of the specials.  If a restaurant is going to flagrantly ignore ethical considerations when choosing their menus, they get one star from me.    (I know, people order it and enjoy it, controversy or not.  Let those people give multiple stars.)"}
{"text":"The food here is good, service attentive however oddly enough after eating and having coffee and settling on almost a $400.00 bill which we were told they could not split we were asked to move to the bar so they can free up the table for another reservation....the bar has no seating available we were given shots on the house  to excuse the request for us to move i guess...overall made the experience fairly uncomfortable"}
{"text":"I'm visiting Toronto on business. I checked out the Yelp reviews for this swank Italian establishment and they did not disappoint. When you step inside, you will notice photos adorning one of the walls showcasing hollywood stars who've eaten here. Well, there's a reason for it. The food is damn good!  Started with charbroiled octopus, nearly a foot long!  Tasted divine! Firm but tender, olive oil, garlic, tomatoes added a succulent touch. Main course was lobser tails, salmon, squid and scallops all cooked to perfection! Yes, if you are salivating because you are a shellfish maven like me, you will be satisfied. Finished it off with a tiramisu, drenched in marscapone and marsala wine. Yum!!!  Yes, the place is pricy so be prepared NOT to come in with a wallet short on bread. But it's worth every penny. Strangely enough, the waiter didn't tell me about the specials for that evening. Another waiter had come by whom I asked about the specials. It did not even occur for my actual waiter to even tell me about the specials. Didn't matter too much as I actually asked him what was the best thing on the menu. He listed several items including the shellfish extravaganza.   If you want to take your client to or your love for some great Italian food, this is the place in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Just up the stairs from Sotto Sotto is Spuntini.  If Sotto Sotto is so so, then Spuntini is just bad bad.    It took three people several bites to realize that they made two wrong pizzas, the flavors were so overpoweringly muddled.  Yes, I know, oxymoron.  The waiter said that he clearly told the chef what we ordered, but \"if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself\" and with that, he disappeared into the kitchen.  Round two...I am assuming that he did actually make those pizzas because no \"chef\" could make a pizza that bad."}
{"text":"Have never found a better waiter. This guy really knows hoe to handle his customers. To top it off the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Spuntini is another Yorkville restaurant that doesn't meet expectations. It's located right next to SOTTO SOTTO. A friend had arranged a dinner for eight of us on a weeknight. Thankfully we were seated right away but that's when the ordeal began. It took the waiter 45 mins to take our orders and bring some bread to the table and this trend continued all evening. We were there for 3.5 hours and not because we lingered over our meals or wine.   The food is not bad - I ordered the seafood for two and split it with my DH. The portion was pretty good and the seafood was cooked well although I wouldn't say it was the freshest seafood I have had.  My main was the mushroom risotto and the rice was perfectly cooked but the mushrooms used were very underwhelming. I don't think they used any porcini at all.   The dessert was the only highlight of my meal. We shared the Dulce de Leche cheesecake and it was really great. But not sure if it is good enough for a second visit."}
{"text":"Every time we are in TO we end up here. We have every intention of using my good pals at Yelp to help choose a new restaurant to try, but then one of us mentions Spuntini and our plans to be adventurous are dashed. Service is impeccable. I had the shrimp and scallop pasta...and to start, the eggplant rolled around goat cheese. Heavenly. My husband had the veal chip and it was cooked to perfection. We sat beside Jeannie Bekker from Fashion TV. I hoped she liked my outfit - lol. Do yourself a favour and go. Now I'm hungry again. Maybe I'll make another res for tonight ;-)"}
{"text":"LOVE this restaurant.  It's been consistently good for many years, and they always remember our names.  Love the food, LOVE the staff."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with amazing food and an endless wine list. We had a group of six (2 seniors, 2 adults, a teenager, and a child) and everyone found something they thoroughly enjoyed. Everyone in the grouped raved about their dinner.  ;) Great service, ambiance, and wine suggestions. We had the four cheese pizza as an appetizer, a variety of salads, and several pastas. All were super yummy!"}
{"text":"This is where a lot of celebrities dine when they are in T.O. so if you want to treat yourself (or someone special) to a memorable Italian fine-dining experience, look no further than this Yorkville hotspot.   It's kind of fun to overhear snippets of conversation about riding cubs and indoor pool troubles at home.   Best value is the penne in vodka cream sauce for $13. Bravo! Go early ( before 6pm) or make a reservation."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner, and the food was delicious! We had the eggplant/cheese appetizer which was phenomenal and probably one of the best appetizers I've had in my life. The goat cheese and eggplant worked so well together. We also had the margherita pizza which was not on the main menu but they still made it, and it was not that great...lacked sauce, and needed more cheese and basil leaves. But maybe that's because I'm obsessed with margherita pizzas and have had way better ones elsewhere. Then we had the lobster for the main, which was really good...but again not the greatest lobster I've had. They brought us complimentary desert for the birthday boy, which was super nice of them. The chocolate cake and tiramisu were both such a treat. In terms of the price, it wasn't too expensive for the location (Yorkville).  Other than the food not being top-notch (but better than average), the service wasn't too great...They took way too long to check up on us each time, and serve our food despite it not being too busy. While the ambiance was beautiful, and the place looked pretty clean, unfortunately we did spot a cockroach crawling on one of the tables in front of us. Once we noticed it, we immediately notified one of the waiters, he seemed surprised, but not too shocked, and simply stepped on it with his shoe to kill it. Did not offer any sincere apologies...  Overall, I really liked the place and food...but I'm not exactly eager to go back so fast. Better service and cleanliness, and maybe I will be."}
{"text":"Great experience.  Food is excellent, staff is really friendly (especially important for us, since we we're not from Toronto) and prices are reasonable, bordering on cheap for pasta and pizzas.  Plus, probably the most impressive wall of celebrity pictures (taken in the restaurant) I've ever seen.  Definitely go to Spuntini if you're in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place was great. Went here for a party and got a private room. Wait staff was very attentive and helpful. I got a pizza, which was good value for the price. It was delicious and I would totally recommend it.   Very nice area & restaurant has great, romantic vibe. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"One of my new favourite restaurants. The food was amazing -- I had Penne Alla Vodka and Chocolate Raspberry cake, and the service was equally amazing. I don't recall what my friends chose to eat but everything was spectacular."}
{"text":"I made sure to make reservations for Spuntini. I made them 2 weeks in advance and arrived right on time. Was this necessary? Well, by the reviews on here, I didn't want to take the chance.   Upon arrival, the birthday girl loved the cuteness of the exterior... i didn't know what that meant but I assumed because it was smallish, semi-detach-esque and homey. When we entered, the first wall was covered in framed photos of celebrities that have been to the restaurant before. That made the restaurant credible, according to the special girl.  The server brought us right over to our table and we were soon greeted by our server \"Frank\". His name wasn't actually \"Frank\", but I called him that the whole night and he seemed to like the joke... at least I hope. Very kind Italian man that I enjoyed to speak with throughout our stay.  Anyways, enough about Frank. Our table was small and the interior was intimate. Dim, candle lit and tables placed close together. The dining room was bustling, many different conversations going on at the same time. The majority of the customers were business oriented, young and old. I liked the ambiance and so did the birthday girl, so the coziness was a plus for us.   We started with the Octopus on bean and green salad. The octopus was a bit tough, however, still flavourful and went well with the beans.   For the main, I had the Seafood Fettuccine with shrimps, clams, mussels and squid. Other than the shrimp tails being left on, it was the perfect dish. The birthday girl ordered the Seafood Risotto which was a bit more but tasted really good. Again, same seafood with the addition of crab and scallops. One of the most flavourful risottos I've had.   Overall, we loved the place. The food was good and reasonably priced. More expensive than your average restaurant but the quality and service speaks for itself. It's a great place to celebrate a special occasion or just for a relaxing evening with a significant other. I will remember my visit to Spuntini as the night I met Frank."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice, both on visits to Toronto with my boyfriend. The first time, we just came across it, and left full and happy. This time, we planned to go back and made reservations, and we weren't so full this time around, but it was still very good.  The atmosphere is right on. My boyfriend and I love intimate, warm restaurants with small tables and candles burning. This place is exactly that. You can't beat it for a date night.  The food has been delicious both times - so delicious that I ordered the same dish each time. I got the Spaghetti Amore, which is linguine in a creamy pesto sauce (you hard me, CREAMY PESTO SAUCE), with red peppers and chicken. It's kind of incredible. To top it off, they serve yummy Italian bread with homemade hummus as a complimentary starter.  They have a decent wine selection, but you won't get out for under $8 a glass, but I've learned to expect that in the city. They have about one choice for each popular wine.  The only thing either of us had been disappointed in was the size of my boyfriend's entree. For about $18, he received five half-moon ravioli stuffed with cheese and mushrooms in a sauce. It was very good, but very small for the price. As a guy who loves to eat, he was a bit disappointed.  Dessert was great: tiramisu and pecan pie with ice cream. Both were homemade.  Overall, super yummy restaurant with a great atmosphere. Definitely a good date night spot in a nice neighborhood in Toronto."}
{"text":"The Event: Birthday party for group of 9  The Good: Taste of food, Portion size, Price  The Bad: Rushed service, Lack of parking, Lack of elbow room  Highlights: Constantly told by multiple staff at least 6 times that we had to finish dinner within 2 hrs due to another table sitting after ours.  Ordered a chocolate cake for dessert...out came tiramisu...WTF?!"}
{"text":"octopus was amazing... perfect!!! i think my pasta was called something amore spaghetti..?? anyhow, it was delish!!!!!! left over was even better the next day!"}
{"text":"I was recently there with a group of 6 friends; I was pretty disappointed with the food. After reading the reviews I had high expectations, total let down.  Everything was just sort of okay. For the price, you can find much better food in the city. The service was quite good, except when it came time to pay, issues with splitting the cheque. I don't get what the big problem is with doing this at restaurants, everyone ends up paying using different cards anyways! I served for years, splitting a cheque is EASY, especially with today's computer software.  The guy ended up doing it, but gave major attitude. So annoying!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing!!!!.  Great atmosphere, friendly staff, beautiful place, and anything you order is marvelous.  Will be coming back soon:)   Thank you!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the city. Now, I might be biased since this is where my husband proposed, but we have been back many times since and it has never, ever disappointed. There is no Yorkville attitude here (despite the lineup of limos during TIFF) and the staff are extremely knowledgeable and friendly. Frankly, you just can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Octopus salad, whole wheat spaghetti. Caesar with homemade crouton, penne with vodka sauce. But what really made this experience was the manager who is friends with the owners. We were there late and he served us gelato, hazelnut and pistachio, and provided excellent conversation even though it was closing time."}
{"text":"My new favourite Italian Ristorante in Toronto!  Let me rave about you Spuntini:  Your service is superb! Our gentleman waiter was extraordinary- he was always there to top-up the wine and recommend menu items for our table. I love that the dining room is basically the wine cellar, with wall-to-wall vino on all sides!   What an extensive Barolo list you have! Does the turista bureau d'Italia have a direct line to your menu?..  Your food is delicious and not too filling. I had a Cesare salad, followed by the Penne a la Vodka and still had energy to party all night long.  And you took our coats on the house!  Move over Sotto Sotto, Spuntini is the Italian King of Yorkville on Avenue Road!  Gracie!"}
{"text":"Spuntini has always been one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! It remains in my top fave places to eat at because of its high quality food that always makes my mouth water, its superb service and its warm and romantic Italian atmosphere!  I was just there again last night for my dad's birthday dinner and it was absolutely delicious!  There are a few things that make this place one of the best Italian restaurants in the city (and trust me, I am picky about my Italian food!)...  Spuntini's menu is a combination of high quality food that is not only delicious but it comes in a good sized portion, so you are never cut short in that sense.  As well, the restaurant itself is classy but the prices are very reasonable, which allows many people to enjoy a night out of sophisticated dining but not at a great expense.  And lastly, the staff are so friendly and helpful! I have tried many things from their menu and I can say that at least half of them are suggestions made by wait staff.   Some food dishes I recommend there after I had the personal experience of devouring it:  - The Gnocchi! (I am obsessed with this pasta dish) - Giant Tiger Shrimp (Entree version) - Gamberoni and Shrimp on linguini (great for seafood lovers) - Rigatoni Portobello  Some other helpful hints about Spuntini:  - MAKE RESERVATIONS! Spuntini takes reservations throughout the week and it's a good thing they do! It is always packed so this is key if you don't want to wait an hour for a table  - If you are not a wine expert, never fear! The staff are knowledgeable in pairing wine with your dinner and are able to also pair you with a wine that fits the size of your wallet.  Overall, this place is a taste of Italian heaven!"}
{"text":"Had a really nice buzz about the place.  Even though the tables are very close together you don't feel distracted by other diners because of the buzz. We were a party of 4 and ordered different dishes. Antipasto - delicious Bufala Mozzarella - delicious  Agnolotti California - delicious Penne Alla Vodka - delicious Spaghetti Del Campo - delicious Cassata D'Agnello Al Forno - delicious Wine and drinks reasonably priced Service - EXCELLENT Would definitely return"}
{"text":"This restaurant is really reasonably priced for the area, and they have an excellent and extensive wine menu. The wait staff are pretty helpful, although we did get a couple heaping scoops of Parmesan in our pasta rather than some nice sprinkles!!  Table of 4 (with reservations):  - The complementary bread was mediocre - two types were served, one type was pretty bad, and one was just okay. It came with a small amount of hummus (very bland), and we had to specifically ask for oil, balsamic, salt and pepper, and butter so that we could enhance the bread experience. anyways enough about that. bread is bread. (unless it's olive bread!! my fav).  - We had the \"Bianca\" white pizza as a starter to share. Toppings were really good, but the crust was slightly burnt and not that flavorful.  - Ravioli di soraia (lobster Ravioli): The ravioli to lobster ratio was heavy on the pasta side and could have used more lobster filling. Sauce was excellent  - Penne alla vodka: Tasty, although I wasn't a huge fan of the bacon in it. would of like this more if it had spicy sausage.  - Linguine Frutti Di Mare: I'd only suggest this if you really like seafood (I do), as it's heavy on the seafood taste.  - Dulce de leche cheesecake: All 4 of us split this. (It's quite large and easy to share). We couldn't finish it because we were pretty stuffed and it just wasn't that great. The top of the cake reminded me of the Kraft caramel candies you get in little cubes during halloween. Basically, if you don't like condensed milk, or haven't tried condensed milk stay far far away from this dessert! Also, since we had someone with a food allergy in our group, we found out it's not made in-house, as they couldn't confirm what was in it. Wish we had tried the tiramisu instead."}
{"text":"portion was big, however pastas are a bit salty to my taste. Nice and romantic ambiance."}
{"text":"Atmosphere for this restaurant is nice but service, not so much.   Came here for a friend's birthday. Although, we made reservations and checked in a few minutes early, we still had to wait a good 45 minutes before sitting down at our table. When we made the reservations, we were informed we would have to leave a certain time - which we didn't think they would enforce, considering we did not get our table in time. However, they did, and we were not impressed.  The space in the restaurant is also very tight, my boyfriend got hit in the head a few times while sitting at the table.  I had ordered a seafood pasta dish, which was kind of bland (not much flavour). My boyfriend had ordered one of the specials of the night - filet mignon, which also was not up to par.  Overall, I've had better pasta. I'm not sure if it was just the two dishes I had that wasn't up to par, as my other friends did enjoy theirs."}
{"text":"Just above super expensive Sotto Sotto this restaurant is a gem. Great ambience, amazing staff and truly spectacular food."}
{"text":"Spuntini Restaurant & Bar is a solid Italian eatery with dim lightening and tight layout. Service is reasonable and knowledgeable. Wines by the glass and half bottle are below average, but our waiter made suggestions that complimented the dishes served. That night we dined on a nicely braised veal chop. The chop was tender and not stringy. Good flavors and respective sauces. Breads were fair.   A sold 3-star establishment."}
{"text":"My favourite Italian restaurant. Warm hospitality, impeccable service and delectable dishes. Not to be overlooked."}
{"text":"I really liked it here! The ambience, the authentic food and staff, the super good wine list, all made for a great evening. The mussels were amazing, the seafood pasta was great, and the tiramisu was delicious!  There is a neat front room that overlooks Avenue Rd, if you go there, try to get seated up there - it's a really cute little area. For a large group and a deposit, you can get that area to yourself.  Our server was great, and as he kept calling us ladies bella, we loved him!! The entire vibe is relaxed and casual but the food and drink is serious.  Highly recommend this place, and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Went here last week, and did not have reservations BUT was taken to a table immediately :). The wine was incredible, and the bread and dip (I think it was a sort of hummus) was great - I recommend asking for oil and vinegar to dip the bread.  For an app we had the eggplant and crostini with cheese - both really good, and the presentation was beautiful! I had the classic pizza as an entree, which I will DEFINITELY get again! Overall, it was a great experience, and you really feel appreciated here.  Will be returning soon"}
{"text":"This is seriously one of my most favorite restaurants.  Ever.  It's up there with Nobu, and I LOVE Nobu.   Why do I love Spuntini's?  The food is incredibly flavorful, fresh, and perfect.  The atmosphere (depending on where you sit and when you go) can be either great for a fun night out, a date night, a birthday, whatever you need it to be.    I have been there three times and have never had any issue with the food or the waitstaff.  The waitstaff is incredibly helpful and prompt, the food comes out in an orderly fashion.  And, another GREAT thing about Spuntini's is the quality you get for the money.  It is EXCELLENT.    I strongly recommend the mussels marinara for an appetizer, the lobster ravioli in crab, lobster, and shallot bisque, and the mango creme brulee.  Absolutely wonderful.   My one and only complaint is the lack of parking.  I had to do street parking the last time I was there, and because I did not read the sign carefully (it was freezing out!), I got left a lovely little parking ticket."}
{"text":"Went last night for another amazing dinner! We ordered the mussels and eggplant appetizers which were both amazing. The broth for the mussels was to die for. For dinner we had all decided on pasta, and from the first bite to the last it was delicious and flavourful. Desert was great as well. Our server was great and answered any questions we had.  Overall we had a great experience :)  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The grilled squid is a Yorkville must. No Yorkville attitude. We were squeezed in on a Friday night, and got a great table in the front room overlooking Yorkville next to the window.  The room was completely full, which gave a nice lively buzz. Cozy, warm atmosphere and savory Italian food. Completely satisfying. Service was debonaire."}
{"text":"I REALLY want to give Spuntini more than  3 stars but unfortunately I can't due to this simple reason:  You CANNOT have a great experience at a restaurant (regardless if the food and drinks are fantastic) and have SHIT service  I was extremely annoyed with my experience at Spuntini because it was the first time my mother and my boyfriends parents were meeting. A friend of ours suggested Spuntini because we wanted to treat our parents to a nice restaurant where there would be delicious food and drinks and a cozy atmosphere.  I loved the decor and how rustic it was- I adore details like this so we were off to a good start. I made reservations for 5 just to ensure we didn't have to wait as it was winter (sorry I wanted to write this review earlier but I kept putting it off because I sounded too much like a raving bitch every time I wrote it- probably will still sound like one.)  Our host brought us to a table which was located on the upper part of the restaurant. Once our waiter arrived , spoke to us and took our drink order- it sort of went down hill on his part from there. After he took our drink order, he left and came back 2 minutes later and told us to had to move to this \"window\" table.  We moved to the \"window\" table because he said unfortunately our table was reserved and I explained to him..yes reserved for us as I made reservations (he said NO).  Anyways, annoyed but moved.  From there on our waiter had a very pissy, rude and snobbish attitude. First of all, I'm not sure who he thought he was. Perhaps he felt special because he worked in yorkville? Congrats. We are paying customers who keep your establishment RUNNING in order for you to receive a pay cheque and maybe if you are lucky..a TIP.  Secondly, he seemed annoyed that our table spoke Portuguese and that we had to translate some of the items in Portuguese for our parents to have a better understanding of it. They all speak English (it's just not their first language and we not used to going to Italian restaurants).  Thirdly, my mom made comments that she was cold and asked if we can go back to that \"reserved\" table that nobody was seated at for 30 minutes and he said \"Welcome to Canada\". Thanks Jerk, she has been living in Canada for 35 years , I'm sure she has experienced more Canadian Winters than you.  (our food finally arrived and was DELICIOUS)  I got the Ravioli Di Soraia (tasty but small in portion-well in my opinion) 2 spaghetti amore (also delicious,decent size and nice presentation- I tried some)  1 stone oven pizza (delicious, flavourful and truthfully tasted like it was baked in a stone oven).   The only meal that was disappointing was my boyfriends (which we warned him) He got a chicken dish- which we questioned. Luckily we all had enough food to give him some of ours ;)  In the end...my waiter didn't even get 10% tip because frankly he was not worthy of a penny. But being a waitress in the past, I felt some sort of guilt (oddly).   I was just hurt by the experience and felt unwanted. What was supposed to be a great experience was ruined by some prick. Everyone at the table was confused and wondering what his problem was. We still enjoyed ourselves and didn't obsess over that jerk- but it still ruins the experience.  I am a foodie. I love trying out new restaurants (and returning to ol' favourites). Spuntini would have been a spot that I would have loved to go back to, but I won't.  I made a comment to the manager and he apologized. I think if you ever have a bad experience at a restaurant (especially when it has to do with the waiters- COMPLAIN). Shit staff members should be tossed to the curb and if the food and beverage industry is not your cup of tea, please find a new industry to work in.  I hope the management reads this and figures out who the problem staff is. Reading most of the low reviews- it seems to be apparent that the problem is not necessarily the food but CUSTOMER service.   :)"}
{"text":"I had a great meal here but it all depends on what you order as our large party had mixed reviews as some loved their dishes and some were 'meh'. I had an amazing tuna steak which was the special for the evening served over risotto. I had it medium rare and it was grilled to perfection with very light seasoning - salt, pepper, olive oil and some lemon juice. Total amazeballs. The risotto was also fab - this was an amazing dish and was perfect on the warm summer night. I also tasted the gnochhi which was pretty average with a heavy cream sauce (not for me) but I've had better, lighter and fluffier gnocchi elsewhere.  The restaurant is busy and popular even on the Wednesday summer evening we were there. It's dimly lit and buzzing with conversation.  Service was good and the wine list was decent. Complimentary bread served with hummus was okay - not outstanding or memorable.  Overall, great meal."}
{"text":"Yorkville places usually give me the heebie jeebies, however this place is neither bad nor great.  Not too expensive for where it is, the staff are nice and responsive, and the food is not bad but not great - I actually found it a little bit bland, but they seem to have options for all price ranges.  To start we had an appetizer platter that had prosciutto, bocconcini, grilled vegetables, calamari salad, grilled tiger shrimp, that was great.  The tomatoes though, were underripe and had no taste to them.    For my main I had some angel hair pasta with mushrooms, spinach and sundried tomatoes - but again, bland.  Throwing on some parmesan cheese didn't seem to help either, although the presentation was nice.    So an underwhelming but nice looking meal.  Nice if you want a romantic-ish place but beware as this place is squishy.  You're better off going to Terroni's."}
{"text":"Spuntini at Yorkville was such a lovely place to celebrate a special occasion- my birthday! The inside was dimly lit and elegant, but we hardly had enough room to seat ourselves. Upon arrival, we were chastised by the staff for not calling in to tell them that we were going to be 15 minutes late. I know that we shouldn't be late, but really, do you have to give us attitude for that? I wasn't impressed at all, but thankfully, the service didn't have any other problems for the rest of the evening.  We went with a pasta feast and ordered many different kinds. I tried some of everyone's order and it was all delicious:  Linguine di mare- linguine tossed with sautéed mussels, calamari, shrimp and baby clams in a white wine and fresh garlic sauce with green onion & cherry tomatoes.   Daily special: butternut squash ravioli with goat cheese. I usually detest goat cheese. However, this pasta turned out to be surprisingly good, and I couldn't taste the goat cheese at all. Too bad I won't get a chance to order this again.  Rigatoni Portabello: Rigatoni tossed with red onions, sun dried tomatoes in a Portobello mushroom pesto cream sauce. The sauce tasted like cream of mushroom soup, but in a very good way. I couldn't get enough of the creamy, scrumptious sauce and I love the bite of the rigatoni. An overall winner!  Penne alla vodka: penne tossed with Italian cured bacon in a tomato cream sauce and a splash of vodka. The bacon bits were delicious, and this sauce is more intense than the other pasta dishes. I would've liked more heat to it, but all in all, I enjoyed it a lot.  Risotto Funghi: Arborio rice with porcini mushrooms in natural broth topped with a truffle essence and grated fresh Parmigiano Regiano. I love the chewy texture of risotto, and the mushroom sauce was quite aromatic. However, I thought that the Rigatoni Portabello had a better mushroom sauce, so with that comparison, it made the dish less desirable.   Desserts were all delicious. We sampled the tiramisu, crème brûlée with mango sorbet, and dulce de leche cheesecake. My personal favourite was the cheesecake, a really decadent treat! The rich dulce de leche and the creamy cheesecake were a match made in heaven! I will definitely reorder this in the future."}
