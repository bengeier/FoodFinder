{"text":"Oh my gawd! The lobster roll became my new obsession - it is fresh, lobster loaded with some crunchy touch of celery that makes it even fresher! 

The brioche bread is lightly toasted and gives a nice contrast. It's like biting into a lobster heaven pillow. The only trouble in paradise is the price $15. You will want to come back for more! 

That's all you need to know!"}
{"text":"Wow! Way better than expected for a tiny stall at the end of Marche Atwater. Ordered the lobster roll, salmon tartare, fish taco and cheeseburger as well as 2 sangria and 2 watermelon agua fresca"}
{"text":"Meh. I went to Atwater market for lunch today and Lucille's has a kiosk there. I love seafood so I decided to treat myself to a lobster roll. At 16$ with tax, I'd say the price tag says \"treat\". The service was nice and friendly and the service was pretty fast. It wasn't very busy that definitely helped I'm sure. 

On to the food. Unfortunately that's were it fell flat for me. The tiny hot dog bun was nicely toasted but super greasy. The lobster portion was just ok, certainly not worth the price in my opinion. Most importantly though, the taste was bland and very forgettable. I don't know why, but the lobster had none of it's natural flavour. No hint of sweetness or freshness that lobster should have, just a bit of heat from the mayo/dressing they use. If I would have closed my eyes there is no way I'd know I was eating lobster. 

I may try the fish tacos next time, but I won't be fooled by the overpriced, underwhelming lobster roll again."}
{"text":"Wowwwww. I have to be honest: I wasn't expecting too much from this place. And that was a surprise. 

The dishes placed and exposed on market was a little bit too much for me. And I'm not into guacamole (shame on me!). 

By I tried the hummus, the chicken, the salad and the (marvellous) Agua Fresca! Watermelon, ginger and soda. Wow. Must try!"}
