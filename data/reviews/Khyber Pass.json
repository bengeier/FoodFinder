{"text":"a wonderful experience here. great area, beautiful patio, and delicious food. 
i would recommend doing the fixed price menu - that way you get to try a lot of different things and it's a great deal. 
we had a great server, as well - really added to the wonderful, friendly afghan culture. recommended this place to all my friends heading to mtl this summer."}
{"text":"Khyber pass is situated in the chic Mont-Royal neighborhood of Montreal: not very far from the metro station of the same name (10-15 minutes from metro to the restaurant on foot). It's a good restaurant in a nice neighborhood with a nice traditional Afghan decor. I'd recommend a reservation before you go there since this restaurant is almost always bustling with foodies and tourists alike. 

The food is pretty good too. It's a BYOB restaurant so overall you won't end up paying more than $30 per person (taxes, tips, coffee/tea, entree, dessert included). I've been to a lot of Afghani restaurants in my life and this one comes pretty close to being authentic. Their speciality is lamb/mutton. Order lamb tikka (BBQ mutton cubes) or kebab, it would be served with plain rice or salad and some daal on the side. Their lamb BBQ, in one word, is \"succulent\". Not spicy, not overdone, not leathery, just \"succulent\". I was a little bit disappointed with the portion size (in fact I asked for more rice to eat with daal  just to have my fill) since the lamb tikka portion, while being delicious, isn't enough for one person. 

The dessert section also needs to be improved. They haven't got many items on it and once again the portions are ridiculously small. You can finish your dinner with green cardamom tea which is very good. 

Remember though that they won't let you stay in the restaurant for more than an hour if there's a reservation after you. So sometimes the servers can be very matter-of-factly and curt. I'd recommend a reservation around 9:30 and since there won't be any reservation after you,(generally not many people reserve a table after 10:30)  you could enjoy your table till around 11:30."}
{"text":"My family and I fell in love with this restaurant. It was so nice to try something that we had never tried before. The food was beautifully flavoured, but not spicy, which is nice for some people. They had a great vegetarian option and the dessert was incredible. The decor, ambience, and service were all perfect as well. Definitely recommend to anyone who wants to try something completely different!"}
{"text":"I was there for the first time last weekend. Great service from the staff, the food was also very good ! Good place for groups."}
{"text":"This is a great Afghani restaurant. Its the only one I know in the city, so I dont have the best reference point, but I really liked it. The food was delicious but took forever to prepare. It wasn't crowded at all and it still took 45min to get our food. I tried their lamb with palao rice, and my friend had the chicken palao, and both dishes were great. I didn't really like the appetizers they gave us, the dips were bland and bread wasn't fresh, but it was complementary and we didnt pay for it so I didnt mind. It was a little pricy as well, but it was worth! I definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"You like lamb? You're into spiced (not necessarily spicy) food? You want a waiter with jokes who's proud of what he's about to serve you? Well come right over friend! 

My partner and I both had lamb dishes with a beef entrée and everything was perfect. Food came out fast (but not \"wait, what\" fast) and our waiter was Excellent with a capital E. 

The place is also BYOW if you're into having silly conversations before awkwardly inhaling food for half an hour in silence only interrupted by what appears to nearby diners to be... grunts of satisfaction?"}
{"text":"So perfect! Not always easy to get a nice homey meal in montreal, big disparity between greasy/fried, full vegan, or fancy french. 

Was perfect for the chilly weather, and easily shared."}
{"text":"Very delicious and very filling. Friendly service. The lamb was delicious."}
{"text":"I celebrated there my birthday and it was amazing. I like Afghan cuisine very much and this restaurant is the best example of Afghan food. The food was healthy and delicious as always."}
{"text":"Excellent! Le service est très sympa. C est vraiment une experience! Je n avais jamais mangé afghan avant et c etait tellement bon! Une cuisine fine, sans chichi, vraiment excellent et pas si cher quand on prend la table d hote. Le cadre est super depaysant on ne se croierait plus a montreal! J ai adoré."}
{"text":"Super satisfied! Small and cozy. Quick service and massive portions for a great price. Get lamb! As BYOWs go, this place is excellent. I went with a friend and we had a great time. Been meaning to go back."}
{"text":"I was so excited reading all the reviews and the restaurant was jam packed but with locals and no Asian !!! That should have been my hint number one. The food service was slow. And my get mad point was when the cashier asked me if I had left my tip on the table. When asked if everything was halal/kosher on the menu , the waiter shrugged and said only lamb shanks, but I'm not judging. The meat had an odd smell. I have been a frequent diner at the best afghan places in the USA and thought I would be getting the same food here. This is good if you don't know real afghani food."}
{"text":"Went here the other night, and it was ok. 

The Mashaba soup was a highlight - very fresh and especially great if you like coriander. I had the vegetarian combo, which was decent overall. I liked that the three different colours of rice were actually distinct from one another in flavour - not just visually. My favourite part of the main plate was actually a kind of onion-type (I think??) salad which I think probably comes on the side of most plates. The rose water pudding is a nice dessert. There is a lot of food, so definitely go hungry.

My dining partner, usually a huge fan of lamb, wasn't super happy with his korma chalaw. And while MY meal was generally ok, this is not my favourite Afghan restaurant in Montreal, so I wouldn't bother going back. I should also note that this place can get ridiculously noisy, which can be a but off-putting if you happen to get squished between rowdy groups...

Ps. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Some of the food was very good; it was a bit on the pricey side compared the other BYOBs on the same street. I didn't care for the breads and dips; the tea was very low quality an bland; the pistachio cream dessert didn't carry much pistachios and the flavours didn't come through. The only good thing was the entree. My friend and I saw how big the portions were so we wanted to share a table d'hote (3 course meal) for $27. Unfortunately, the waitress told us that we had to order a minimum of 2 main dishes even though it would be an overload of food. I disliked this policy and I have never heard of this in any restaurant in Montreal. I have lived here for 10 years. To try a bit of everything, we order 1 table d'hote and 1 entree. Our main dishes were the lamb shank ($23) and the meatballs and rice ($19). To give you an idea, the meatballs came with 3 servings of different coloured rice. Do they carbo-load or something? Our meals came out to around $40 including taxes and tip. It was quite expensive since we didn't get to order what we wanted. We ordered what we HAD to in order to stay at the restaurant. We took home 60% of the food. This was ridiculous because if we were not going home right after, we would end up carrying 2 lbs of leftovers around until the end of the night or sadly wasting the food because we were not allowed to order the portion that we wished.  

2 things to keep in mind: 
1) BYOB (SAQ is very closeby if you forget)
2) You must order at least 1 main dish per person so be prepared to carry leftovers!"}
{"text":"I went to Khyber Pass for a birthday dinner.  There were quite a few of us and we were seated in a back room that was barely large enough to accommodate our very large group size.

Khyber Pass is a \"Apportez Votre Vin\" restaurant which is good cause you can bring all the wine you want and get drunk for cheap.  So a lot of us brought wine. 

You can choose from either two table d'hote or a la carte.  I went with the table d'hote where you get a choice of a soup or salad, appetizer, main dish and dessert and then a choice of either coffee or tea.

The cucumber salad was a good choice, however if you get the lamb with your main dish, it will come with the salad anyways.  The sambossa is a good choice for your appetizer.  it definitely is fried goodness.

The lamb is pretty good and it is hard to get good lamb in Montreal.  However, I am not a fan of rose water, thus not a big fan of the dessert here.

As for the decor, it definitely needs to get with the times.  Outdated to say the least."}
{"text":"I had to try this place out after reading all the reviews here. 
We didnt have a reservation, and the upstairs section was all full. So, they sent us to the 2nd section in the basement. I was kinda glad that we got sent there. It looked like we were in some sort of cave carved out of stone. It was really warm and cozy in there. 

The food was amazing as well. The portion were huge. The chicken was juicy and tender and lamb was falling off of the bones. 

the only negative was that we were forced to take one main dish per person because we brought in our own wine. At least they didnt charge any corking fees."}
{"text":"On of my favorite restaurants in Montreal. The food is flavorful, if you like lamb meat this Afghani place serves it with rice and veggies all spiced with herbs. Really good stuff! The service is good but you have to make reservations if you're going there on weekends."}
{"text":"Je ne connaissais rien a la cuisine Afghane, merci à la serveuse qui prend son temps pour expliquer les plats et donne son avis, c'est toujours plaisant!

Deux menus sont proposés, et permettent de choisir toutes les spécialités présentent sur la  carte, ce qui fait un repas tout compris pour 25-30$ !

Le service est excellent, rien a redire, on est aux petits soins pour nous!
Les plats se suivent sans que le temps d'attente ne se fasse ressentir, la quantité est présenté, et heureusement pour nous, la qualité aussi!
La majorité des plats sont a base d'agneau, la viande est bien cuite, le mélange d'épice relève le goût sans sombrer dans une cuisine trop épicée qui peut rapidement écurer voire dégoûter un palais novice.

Seul petit bémol, le dessert qui n'est pas excellent à mon gout, mais a chacun de se faire son opinion!

Pour moi c'est un restau a refaire aussi souvent que l'envie viendra!"}
{"text":"Overrated.  Lamb shank was dry and needed salt.  Service was rude and had too many rules. The only saving grace was you can bring your own wine, so at least you forget about the experience till the morning."}
{"text":"Great afghani food...the meat was so tender and delicious. Went on a very busy night and the service was fast and attentive. Restaurant is on the small side with tables close together and that would be the only negative thing, other than that it was a great experience..would go back again"}
{"text":"Mon restaurant favori sur le Plateau! Entre succullents mets afghans, une ambiance feutrée et un service impeccable, on a envie d'y retourner aussitôt le repas terminé. Il y'a une magnifique terrasse à l'arrière du resto. Côté menu, tout est délicieux. Petite préférence pour l'agneau assaisonné et braisé à la perfection. Coup de coeur!"}
{"text":"Belle découverte . La cuisine afghane est un mélange de cuisine perse et arabe . L'agneau est délicieux et les raviolis au poireau aussi! Réserver auparavant"}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés en octobre 2016 pour mon anniversaire, nous avions pris leur menu dégustation, tout était succulent, épices, saveurs délicieux.
Restaurant chaleureux et très propre.
Le service a été assez rapide étant donné le nombre de gens qui étaient présents.
À y retourner encore cette année."}
{"text":"J'avais déjà écrit une critique du Khyber Pass il y a plusieurs mois. Depuis, j'y suis retourné à quelques reprises, alors je mets mon avis à jour. D'autant plus que maintenant, je connais bien le nom des plats. Alors, voilà :

Selon moi, il y a deux plats principaux qui se démarquent (les autres sont excellents, également, mais les deux que je vais nommer, promis, sont exquis - mon opinion, en tout cas, et je la partage). Il s'agit du Korma Chalaw (morceaux d'agneau trempés en sauce tomate aux épices afghanes et accompagné d'un trio de riz basmati) et du Kabuli Palaw (jarret d'agneau servi avec des légumes et un riz basmati brun aux épices afghanes). Pour ce qui est des entrées, j'aime bien Ashak et Mantoo (le menu explique bien ce que c'est). Ah oui, et essayez la soupe Mashaba, c'est très bon.

Le service est très cordial, toujours avec le sourire, ça donne le goût d'y retourner. Ce point est important, je trouve. J'aime bien un restaurant où je ne me sens pas comme un numéro ou comme un tata qui ne comprend pas le menu. Aucun problème de ce genre au Khyber Pass.

Un conseil : si vous voulez y aller un vendredi ou un samedi, réservez ! Sinon, bonne chance. C'est très populaire, pour des bonnes raisons."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended and absolutely lived up to its reputation. Excellent service and food. We were a party of four and each ordered something different so that we could share and try all the different flavours. The only reason I'm not rating it with 5 stars is because it was crowded and quite noisy, but I'll definitely be back and recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"It was my first visit to Montreal so I was quite excited when I discovered this place while conducting some pre trip internet research. 

I leapt at the opportunity to try Afghani food as this is not something available in any sense in central Texas. That said, I'll be the first one to question the validity of my assessment. 

To start, the place has a streamlined if not limited selection. That is not to say that any of it was bad but but I'll explain that later. The menu basically gives you two prefixe options with the primary difference being the addition of an appetizer. 

I decided to go all the way since the $4 price difference seemed negligible and included coffee. I started with the Mashaba, a warm soup that was perfect for the cold night.  It was certainly tasty, but essentially a pretty standard beef broth and vegetable deal. 

At the server's somewhat unenthusiastic recommendation I went with the Mantoo for my second course.  I'm surprised he wasn't more excited because the delicate little dumplings with mild yogurt and tomato sauces were really very nice. Much better then the seemingly more popular yet comparatively boring Sambossas and probably the best thing I had.  

For the main dish I followed the crowd and ordered the lamb shank with brown basmati and raisins.  All in all the dish was very tasty, the meat well prepared and and the rice not overly salty. But somehow it lacked a certain je ne sais quoi I was hoping for in terms of spice. 

In total it was very difficult to decide whether to rate this place as a three or a four.  The service was efficient but not spectacular and the food was good, just not amazing. All in all just good."}
{"text":"We had been turned out of quite a few brewpubs today because we have a one year old. BUT we were warmly accommodated at Khyber Pass. High chair; check. Superb rice, the pudding and soup were beautifully done, and I really enjoyed my lamb shank. I have walked by this place many times on my way to Au Pied du Cochin...I now wish I had come here instead. Nice. Comforting and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I don't know how many times I've been here.

Love it. I always have the lamb (the one with raisins in the rice).

Don't forget to bring your own wine + mention if it is someone's birthday (they sometimes have a gift for you)"}
{"text":"Besair khob! One of the best Afghan restaurants I've ever been to, tasted just like my mother's cooking!"}
{"text":"I had a surprise birthday here with a reservation of 24 but 30 people showed up and they were able to accommodate us... For that I'm grateful!  They also let us bring our own cake! How nice! The food is amazing with HUGE portions! The special menus come with soup or salad, appetizer, main and dessert! Totally worth it and yummy! No wonder this restaurant is very busy because of its service and affordable prices.  Not to mention the bring your own wine or beer option is awesome to save money. Totally recommend and thank you khyber pass for hosting our surprise birthday party!"}
{"text":"If you like to hear comments like \"We do not let coloured people drink wine here...yeah, I said it,\" or to hear the cashier condescendingly address your colleague when their own debit machine malfunctions, then this is the place for you. Great establishment. Top notch customer service. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I have heard it's delicious, but omg it was amazing!! Very cute and cozy restaurant, they told us that it was full but we insisted and they gave us a table for two :). We had the table d'hote. The lentil soup was the best ever in MTL we tried the other soup too(beef & yogurt) and it was also good. We had the aubergine appetizer and the samboosad. Yum. And the lamb in tomato sauce ugh to die for. Just go and try!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place in June and reviewed it on another site, thought I should add one here.

Best meal I've had in Montreal yet. Went with 3 friends, native from Montreal, St Louis, Durbin S.A. and me from Seattle. We all had lamb shank prepared two different ways. The owners son was our waiter, very knowledgeable about the menu. We let him pick out appetizers, the flavors were incredible, shank fell apart on the plate. Best part, you can bring your own bottle of wine, actually, have to bring your own if you want any. Old zoning laws, makes for a relatively cheap night out. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Loooved it. Unusual, clearly authentic, and delicious.  You won't recognize anything on the menu so just ask the waiter what to have and follow his advice.  

In addition to the great food the decor is very fun. You feel like you're in a cozy Sherpa hut. Even on a warm Montreal summer evening! 

Khyber Pass is one of those places where you know as soon as you walk in that you made a good choice, because everyone there sounds happy.  We were."}
{"text":"Incredible food !!!! Omg so goooddd !!! Seriously, even though you are not a fan of lamb... you will enjoy theirs !! The spices and everything os very well balanced. Amazing food and ambiance !"}
{"text":"Wow!  Really surprised by how good the dining experience was.  Staff were very friendly and attentive, and the food was great.  I had a leg of lamb and the spice combination was excellent.  $28 for a fixed price menu that i almost couldn't finish - good think I can pack away good meals!  

We ate out back on the terrace as the interior was very warm, but that's where all the other patrons were eating too!  Just a few buildings down the road from Au Pied de Cochon."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for Mon night and asked to be seated in the outdoor terrace out back. When we arrived almost 30 min earlier, they graciously seated us. The vibe out in the terrace was great - lots of big groups and given the bring your own wine environment, people definitely seemed to be enjoying themselves. Menu can be a la carte or 2 combination options. We opted for the 4 course which included a choice of soup or salad, appetizer, entree, and finished with desert + tea all for something like $32! What a deal. I had the soup with noodles, fried eggplant, and lamb leg with spices. Everything was delicious and the portions are huge. I ate the entire lamb leg but definitely was not able to finish the rice. Service was fast and friendly. Left feeling happily full and a bit tipsy :) Though I usually don't eat a lot of heavy meats like this, I am definitely looking forward to our next Montreal visit to stop here."}
{"text":"Très bon! La grande table d'hôte en vaut grandement la peine, ça permet de découvrir la carte. La nourriture est excellente,  très goûteuse a l'exception des entrées de pâtes et de légumes frits qui ne goûtent pas grand chose. Le plat végé et les assiettes viandes et brochettes sont toutes délicieuses.  Le service est excellent aussi."}
{"text":"I'm very familiar with Afghani food.  In Boston area, we had 2 Afghani restaurants, and one of them, Helmands, is owned by Hamid Karzai's brother, and it's located in Cambridge, MA.  However, my date (who's from Boston area as well) and I both enjoyed KP more than Helmands in Cambridge, MA.

We went to KP on a vacation to Montreal with a group of 4 others, and we sat in the corner close by some props, which included an old rifle, a mannequin with a hat, etc.  Our server was named Mobeen, and he was so nice, professional, proud, outgoing, and he made our evening come alive!

He gave me tons of respect because I have tons of respect for Afghani people as well, and we cracked jokes.  He had us pose with the gun as a prop, and our hostess pretended that she was holding us hostage in one photo.  In another, she wore the mannequins vest and Muslim hat.  

Mobeen, if you read this, I hope that you're always blessed and happy in life."}
{"text":"Definitely a go-to if looking for an intimate restaurant that has a different cultural feel.

It's located on plateau-mont-royal and apart from the location, what first attracted us to going to this restaurant was that it was a bring your own wine/or beer. It's a very small restaurant, often crowded I would assume, reservations can be made in advance. My partner and I were lucky enough to be able to be seated without reservation as there was only one table left when we arrived. 

The waitresses who served us is the best hostess I've ever had in my entire life. Amazing service, experience and food.
29$ for a table hôte: soup/salad, main course, dessert, tea/café."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem in the heart of the Plateau. The food is quite authentic (and delicious), and prices are amazing, and the service has always been great. Reservations needed as it is a small place. Also, who doesn't love the fact that it's a BYOW type of place???? ;)"}
{"text":"Was recommended by an Afghani friend to try this place out. It didn't disappoint. Four of us went for dinner and all of our dishes were amazing. Their meat is tender and seasoned to perfection. I forgot what I took because I remembered the name of the dish I want to take next time, that's the dish my boyfriend had:  chicken pulao. It's like an Afghan take on biryani with their own spices (which are quite different from the Indian spice cabinet). The rice was the show stopper, overflowing with flavour and the right kind of consistency, not too sticky not too dry. Portions are huge, worth the $25(avg) you're gonna pay there. Their ambience is also pretty chill and really good for having a special dinner out and at the same time not getting too fancy. The only reason I gave them a 4star instead of 5 is because their dishes were pretty high on sodium (doesn't mean it's salty, the taste is amazing) and we felt bloated till the next day."}
{"text":"A favorite in Montreal. Bring your own wine and high expectations for amazing authentic Afghan cuisine. Ordered the table d'hote both times. The lentil soup, pumpkin and leek dumplings are delicious starters and the mains are great to share. The back terrasse is a treasure in summer."}
{"text":"Excellent food
Great service
Great portions
Had the korma lamb , absolutely incredible.
Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"Everything tastes good in this place. I had the beef meat balls and basmati rice trio. My friend had the chicken kebab with basmati trio. They serve it with a simple salad which tastes great with the combination of the dish. The kebab is delicious and juicy cooked to perfection. I really enjoyed the rice trio as well. Great place for dinner; Always packed, i went there twice before and couldn't get a seat so i had to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Dinner at Khyber Pass was the best meal we had during our stay in Montrèal. I ordered the vegetarian platter, which had the most delicious eggplant I've had in a while. The restaurant is also BYOB, which is nice if you want to bring your own bottle of wine. We sat outside which was in a beautiful courtyard area with lots of plants and flowers."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing. The owner and the staff are so welcoming and friendly. The food is delicious. The design (both inside and outside) is harmonious and eye-catching. Love to go there for our celebrations, dinner with friends and any other occasion. Kabuli polo is my favorite and you should not miss Bara Kabab. Don't forget your wine :D"}
{"text":"Cuisine raffinée, très jolie terrasse, bon accueil, par contre il est conseillé de réserver."}
{"text":"Depuis le temps que j'en parlais, j'ai finalement fait le grand saut: j'ai essayé le restaurant Khyber Pass.

On nous offre la possibilité de 2 choix de table d'hôte. C'est ce que j'ai fait. Comme entrée, j'ai pris une soupe mashaba, soit un mélange de nouille, légumes, boeuf haché, yogourt, coriandre. Un  borani à la citrouille par la suite (citrouille, curcuma, yogourt, sauce tomate, ail). Mon plat principa fut le Chopan Khabab (brochette d'agneau).

Si les plats sont subtilement relevés, avec finesse, je dois avouer que le choix limité de dessert m'a un peu déçu. Qu'importe, mon pouding à l'eau de rose et pistaches était délicieux

Excellent service. Aucune attente, peu coûteux."}
{"text":"Beautiful, cozy atmosphere with richly flavored food. My husband and I ordered within the prix fixe menu structure, choosing a soup or salad, entree, main dish, and a dessert. Both our soups were amazing--just wonderfully seasoned. For an entree we had the fried eggplant--again, the seasoning was just wonderful. I then enjoyed the lamb shank with spinach, while my husband ate a meatball main course. Both our dishes were accompanied by a generous plate of three different rices and a cucumber salad. Finally, for dessert, we had a rose and pistachio custard that was sublime. Ambiance was lively but intimate. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Après avoir mangé la-bas ca nous donne le goût de devenir afghan juste pour avoir la chance de manger de l'agneau avec autant de gout et des épices qui vous rappelle les voyages de marco polo en orient. Bon, j'exagère peut-etre sur les épices mais il me semblait justement que marco polo avait gouté à des desserts à l'eau de rose. Peu importe je dis! Ce restaurant nous permet d'apporter un vin de choix et d'apprécier son ambiance atypique qui nous fait voyager en même temps.

Si vous êtes heureux à voyager mais n'avez pas assez d'air miles pour vous y rendre , je conseille fortement ce resto pour une soirée amoureuse ou entre amis."}
{"text":"Very pretty place with some tasty food. Love how they cook their lamb. A bit pricy I find but it's bring-your-own-wine resto. Good ambience to have a good meal and catch up with good old friends."}
{"text":"While traveling to Montreal we never ate cuisine from Afgan and decided to try something new. Resteraunt was charming with alot of personal touches. we had a 5 course cuisine. with soup the red lentel soup is a must and the eggplant and pasta appetizer and the lamb shank cuisine with flavorful rices and a salad and then afgan tea with a rice pudding in rose water. The whole meal was a unique experiene and some of the most amazing spices. The staff was super friendly and helpful. When in Montreal come here to Khyber Pass you wont regret."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! This was my first time every having Afghani food and I loved it! Great service and beautiful ambiance. Now, I have to find something close to this in Brooklyn :/"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Great, savoury food - loads of flavour. Decent variety in menu, but meat lovers will dig this place the most. Small environment, so groups over 4 is not gonna happen. BYOW so holler!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice. First time, no complaints. The food is great and it was at a good value. My only complaint, which is a big one and occurred during my second visit, is about the rude waitress. As we were heading out of the place after we paid, the waitress looked at the tip that we left and asked us to leave more next time because of taxes and other expenses. If there is anything I hate, it is when waitresses stop me before I leave the restaurant and give me a lecture about the tip and how much I should leave. Clearly, this waitress had no idea what customer service is since she was EXTREMELY rude. Will not come back. Also, the tables are too close to each other and it was a little uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Ce resto afghan vaut vraiment la peine d'être testé!
Les plats sont vraiment succulents et c'est un apportez votre vin, alors ça ne vous coûtera pas 60$ la bouteille comme dans la plupart des restos.
Les soupes sont extraordinaires et l'agneau exquis.
Possibilité de réserver aussi des tables de groupe au sous-sol, dans une ambiance taverne vraiment sympa.
Les serveurs sont très agréables et les prix corrects
Essayez-le! :)"}
{"text":"Sooo yummmy!!! I had the lamb shank which was just falling off the bone in a delicious tomato sauce served with 3 types of rice.... would like to come back...."}
{"text":"Food was good, prices were ok, more like $$$ instead of $$. Had a problem with paying though, they only take Visa and some Canaiden card. I've never been to a place anywhere in the world that took visa and not MasterCard, very disappointing."}
{"text":"A very nice warm and cozy place for a BYOW multi-course meal!
It is nice change from the greek and italian options in the area. The atmosphere was perfect for the very very cold night that we went!

Soups were both good. We shared the Mantoo entree which gets you the most bang for your buck entree wise and was a great mix of flavours. I had the lamb shank, which was fall-off-the-bone tender. My husband had the lamb kebab which was cooked perfectly. I normally love rice but didn't find much of a flavour difference between the three rices offered. I really enjoyed the fresh salad. The rose pudding dessert was interesting, not my favourite.

Service was great - I will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice little place - Often packed so make sure you book!
Can get very cramped, in a everyone-bumps-in-your-chair-as-it's-also-in-the-way kind of way so don't expect a cosy romantic atmosphere.
Service is nice and attentive though quick and the food is good. We got the tables d'hôte as this allows you to sample a little bit of the menu : Soups, starters and mains with a dessert and tea for 30$ each. Everything was good but did not get us overly excited besides the quail skewer!
A good place to try though!"}
{"text":"Hilarious place.  the waiter once told us to look under our table just in case Osama Bin Laden was there hiding.

Anyway...

Decent service.  Good food.  Slightly over-priced."}
{"text":"Came here while visiting Montréal. I will definitely be back. The portion sizes are generous. The service is friendly and the food... absolutely delicious! I have quite a bit of Afghan food - Khyber Pass has a more high end feel bringing this often overlooked delicious cuisine to a more mainstream audience. I highly recommended this restaurant - I could eat the veggie platter and house lentil soup every day!"}
{"text":"BYOW (bring your own wine)Pleasantly surprised! We were in the area actually trying to go to another restaurant and couldn't get in. This spot caught our eye and we decided to just try it!  What a great and random find. The menu options were plentiful with a delicious veggie option! The prix fixe options were great but even without all that food the portions are huge! Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"-amazing ethnic decor
-the best lentil soup I have ever had
-sambosa and manti are restaurant made and delicious
-lamb falls off the bone
-kofta is bursting with flavor
-can't go wrong with any variant of basmati rice"}
{"text":"J'ai adoré  le restaurant. Très bonne ambiance,le service est excellent et la bouffe est très bonne. On paie bien mais on mange très bien."}
{"text":"I came here with a big group of friends for a little holiday dinner, it was all our first time having Afghan food and we were all blown away. Khyber Pass's dining rooms split in two, the upstairs for smaller sized groups/tables and a downstairs for bigger groups. We were in the downstairs area given the size of the group. The décor was pretty, was all molded to feel like a stone hut or cave with some nice accents with colored banners. Definitely put you in the mood!

Service from the waitress was very attentive and very informative, she was explaining the major difference between Afghan food and Indian food or Middle Eastern food as well as giving good suggestions on the menu. A lot of us ended up taking the 'table d'hôte' given its value (includes appetizer, soup, main dish, dessert, coffee/tea). A lot of food came with the table d'hôte, we were more than filled at the end, not to mention every single course was delicious. I had the Lamb Korma (braised lamb leg in tomato-based sauce). The meat just fell off the bone, was super tender and tasted great. If you're afraid of spicy food, no worries, Afghan food is not spicy at all, and just more fragrant and savory compared to Indian food. They have a nice variety of basmati rices as well which each provide some different flavors to contrast with your main meat dish.

My only complaint for the downstairs area is the two service times at 6pm and 8:30 pm, we had to leave promptly by 8:15 due to the next service, but everything else was so good that it was forgivable. Just make sure to get the later service if you'd like to take your time and talk after dinner. All in all, Khyber Pass was a great discovery, I'd highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Montreal. Simple... affordable (byow)... no fake glamour...very good lamb, entries and lentil soop. Service is great. Backyard terrace is very nice too. My friends and I hang out there at leat once a month. Give it a try any won't regret."}
{"text":"I've had comparably delicious and authentic Afghan food on the South Shore for much less, but then their atmosphere, ambiance and location can't come close to Khyber pass, whose interior decor and summer patio are a delight. Service is always attentive and the food spiced wonderfully, the different courses blending melodiously together."}
{"text":"Husband and I went here a few weeks ago. I ordered the Korma Chalaw which is a Lamb Skank piece in Tomato sauce with a Trio of Rice. The husband and I ordered our own meals, which ended up being a lot of food. We immediately regretted not sharing!! 
The ambience is cosy and the place is well decorated. We have had authentic Afghani food before and felt that the food here was on point. However after hearing such great reviews, we expected the food to be better. 
Service is good and the place is BYOB."}
{"text":"La cuisine afgane n'est pas timide au niveau des épices. Du cumin, de la coriandre, de la menthe, de la cardamone, du safran.. Chaque plat avait une nouvelle saveur, un goût qui m'était alors inconnu, moi qui était alors une nouvelle initiée à cette culture culinaire. 

Mon coup de coeur va surprenamment à la soupe maison de lentilles rouges. Une soupe, me dites-vous?! Oui! Je ne prends jamais de soupe quand je vais au restaurant, mais celle-ci était inclue dans la table d'hôte et ça m'a fait réaliser que je devrais faire le move \"soupe\" plus souvent en entrée; on fait de belles découvertes et en plus, ça laisse plus de place pour la suite!

Les portions sont très généreuses, et l'agneau semble être le plat de choix pour vivre une expérience optimale. Par contre, j'ai pour ma part opté pour l'assiette végétarienne: un trio de riz parfaitement cuit et assaisonné, des légumes cuits et sauté aux saveurs afganes et une jolie salade concombres et menthe. On termine le repas avec un doux thé à la cardamone et un pouding de riz aux pistache et à la rose, ça passe tout seul!

C'est un apportez votre vin, ce qui réduit la facture, et une table d'hôte 5 services pour 30$ c'est assez abordable je trouve. Les plats arrivaient vite et chauds, et on a jasé avec un des membres de la famille du proprio; une équipe très fière de ce qu'ils offrent et avec raison! Je vous conseille de faire une réservation, car c'est assez dur d'avoir une place sinon. Une expérience à vivre au moins une fois, puis de temps en temps seulement, pour garder cette magie de \"nouveauté\"!"}
{"text":"Une ambiance super dépaysante , un service sympa, des plats copieux et savoureux  . Le meilleur afghan de la ville"}
{"text":"Bonnes portions, délicieux, authentique, et BYOW; j'adore!"}
{"text":"I like to go here about once a year. The food is pretty good, but I don't feel drawn to it more than that.

A couple years ago they decided to do a revamp their exterior finish. I can tell you that they basically covered the old crusty façade with a series of wooden boards. Now, it's the inside it needs a bit of a facelift. The old chairs and tables and carpets could use some replacing.

The best kept secret about this restaurant is the Terrasse in the back. Unless you know it's there, you would never tell by standing on the street.

This is a fairly inexpensive restaurant. Which is also helped by the fact that it's bring your own wine. My suggestion... Go in the summer and sit on the terrace. I think you'll be pleasantly pleased."}
{"text":"Gorgeous décor (including the outside of the restaurant with its curving wooden exterior walls), incredible food and the prices on the menu are nicely offset by the fact that you can bring your own wine. I took out two friends and the bill came to about $100 for the three of us, so not too bad. Did I mention INCREDIBLE food? Everything was delicious, flavourful and satisfying. The patio courtyard in the back is a delightful place to sit in the early evening during one of their specified dinner hours. They basically serve dinner during designated hours twice in the evening. If you miss the first wave, you head on in for the second wave. Meals are relaxed and food is served with impeccable timing (always a big plus as far as I'm concerned). Definitely a stand-out restaurant in the heart of the Plateau, where great restaurants proliferate."}
{"text":"Un restaurant tout à fait exceptionnel! L'agneau, le riz, les cailles... tout est sublime! Le service est courtois et attentionné!"}
{"text":"Un bon restaurant de cuisine traditionnelle. Deux formules principales sont proposées avec des choix pour découvrir la cuisine afghane.
Il est recommandé de rapporter son vin car il n'y en a pas sur place. Les plats sont cuisinés avec soin et les portions sont généreuses. 
Il est préférable de réserver ou de s'y rendre de bonne heure.
Le personnel est agréable et réactif.

La terrasse à l'arrière est un havre de paix. A tester !"}
{"text":"I've had so many people recommend this place to me and I'm glad I listened to them. Fellow yelpers, go try this place now!!
Small and welcoming atmosphere with the most delicious Afghani food."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant avec une saveur vraiment distinctive, le prix est abordable et le service également excellent. C'est à recommander, il faut l'essayer, point final."}
{"text":"Khyber Pass is just OK. Nothing special except for the large terrace which made the overall experience pleasant on a very hot summer night.  As for the food its the usual kebab house fare. We had starter of sliced eggplant and yogurt sauce and a stuffed pastry of leek and lamb that was somewhere between a samosa and an empanada which was very tasty.The mains of grilled quails and lamb chowla were a little disappointing. The gimmick here is to fill you up on rice; the plates were full of three varieties which basically tasted the same. They are a little skimpy with the protein items. $80 bucks for two including tax and tip is too pricey for this type of food. I know BYOB  is a Montreal tradition, but, you are not really saving anything by going here. So next time I will pass on Khyber Pass."}
{"text":"I had spent a lot of time reading all the wonderful reviews for this place and had always wanted to go so I finally went this weekend and I have honestly never been so disappointed in a highly reviewed yelp restaurant in my life. It started out fine, our waiter wasn't particularly friendly but the ambiance was very cool. 

We each ordered the four course table d'hote. We each tried one of the soups which were both actually really good so we were excited for our mains. 

Our appetizers were bland; I chose the Mantoo too which was overcooked and bland. He had to eggplant which was just a soggy mess. 

 My date chose the first lamb with raisins option and I went with the lamb with spinach. While the meat was tender, it was honestly disgusting. His had barely any taste and mine was just gross. 

The dessert at the end I actually really enjoyed. Sweet and flavorful. Unfortunately, it didn't save the meal.

Overall, super over-rated. The ambiance is original but for the price, the food was horrendous. The best part was the soup, pudding dessert and the fact that we could bring our own wine. 

I will honestly never recommend this place to anyone. There are so many better BYOW in this city."}
{"text":"We went here with a friend that lives in Montreal and it was great. You can bring your own wine and they are very accommodating about that. In fact, the server was very helpful in meeting all of our needs. They bring out really good bread and sauces to start with. All of the sauces are yummy. 

The food was excellent. My friend suggested we get lamb which I did not... to my dismay. I had a meatball dish in a tomato sauce, my husband had a beef kabob and our friend had the lamb. I really loved my food but I will definitely go for the lamb next time. Dishes are in the $18-22 range but you get a lot of food with that. Overall, a really great experience."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my food here.  I lived in Uzbekistan (just north of Afghanistan) for several months and their food was similar to Afghan.  I ordered the palaw and it brought back a lot of nostalgia from my time in Uzbekistan.  

The rice dish can be a bit greasy but that's what makes it so tasty.  The chicken buried under the pile of rice was quite flavorful.  The price is a bit steep but I'm guessing it's higher since they allow you to bring your own wine.  My wife and I split the plate and it was enough for both of us.  She was especially full, but I was just satisfied.  Our plate was $20 but it would have been a bit too expensive for me if we each got our own dish.  

Service was pretty poor.  It started off well, but ended poorly.  We made reservations because it usually fills up quickly so we were able to sit down when we arrived.  We placed our orders and the food came out in good time.  After finishing our meal, my friend had dessert coming.  It took probably around 10-15 minutes after we were all finished and they had cleared our table before her rice pudding came out.  We noticed that the restaurant had completely filled up and it looked as though they were understaffed.  That seemed odd to me since most of the people there made reservations so they should be prepared.  They didn't bring the bill then so we had to flag down a waiter to get it.  

For food, I would give it 4 stars, but the service was 1 star.  For me, food always outweighs the service which is why I'm giving it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent Afghan food. There pasta with ground meat, which are like ravioli, are delicious. I highly recommend it. My wife's chicken dish with basmanti rice with raisins was pretty yummy too. I was also impressed with how fast the food came out. It was like fast food speed, but high quality food."}
{"text":"I love this place. Its like one of those holes in the wall places that serves really awesome food from countries you would never visit. In this instance, it's afghan food. The decor is kinda cavey and orientally, which is interesting. Kind of makes you feel like ur in a cave. Its almost always crowded everytime i went. Its great for groups and for a first date type dinner. 

Byow - yes! Bring ur own drinks and enjoy the food and your alcohol 

I love that there isn't a lot of selection on the menu. And i love that there are fixed meal plans. A full course with desert and tea for 27$ or including an appetizer for $30. And then. You just pick which one you want. I suggest splitting the appetizers among yourselves so you can try everything. And always get the lamb! My favorite dishes are the lamb with brown rice and carrots and the lamb with tomato sauce. Heavenly dishes! I always have alot of left overs to take home. Portions are huge.

My only complaint is that the salad has raw white onions. Im a raw onion hater, and they can't remove them. 
Even with that, i love this place!"}
{"text":"This place was an absolute gem.  I went on a beautiful summer night and the outdoor seating was magical.  I also noticed that the indoor seating was incredibly intimate despite the decent size of the restaurant.  

I got the mantu with three different kinds of rice, and my date got a tomato chicken dish.  These two dishes blew my mind away.  The rice... the mantu... the chicken.  I do not have a recommendation because ALL of the food was wonderful.

One of the most magical restaurants I have ever been to.  I highly recommend bringing a date, very romantic scene."}
{"text":"I have never tried Afghan food but I thought it might be very similar to asian food due to the proximity of Asia. 

We rented a table next door of the main restaurant. The decoration has this cave feel-like atmosphere, it was underground with dimly lit light. It was light enough to see where we are going. 

After we ordered, I received my lentil soup and it was very good. My main dish, the portion was big enough to feed two people. Obviously, I couldn't finish it all. The dessert was a rose yogourt... I am not sure what they called it but it tastes similar to creme brule.  I devoured that thing in five seconds. 

Overall, I give this place a 4 stars. Something that tastes this great for under 25 dollars for a three courses meal is something I will rave to the world."}
{"text":"I didn't think I'd go all the way to Montreal to try Afghan food, but as it turned out we finally did get full of all the rich French food we had been eating and needed something different on our last night in town. This place had caught our eye several times as we had been walking to Au Pied de Cochon. It turned out great, as it was inexpensive and friendly, and the food was good. We all got one of the table d'hôte options for about $25, including soup, appetizer, main course, dessert, and coffee/tea. I started with the Mashaba soup, which included noodles, vegetables, ground beef, yogurt, and coriander. Very delicious. For my appetizer, I got the Ashak, which was small boiled pastas stuffed with chopped leek and served with mint yogurt and ground beef tomato sauce. This was good but a bit heavy after the soup; I preferred the pumpkin borani that my brother ordered (my husband got the eggplant borani but he wolfed it all down before I got the chance to try it myself). For my main course I got the Korma Chalaw, a trio of basmati rice served with lamb chunks cooked in tomato sauce. The lamb was nice and tender, but I was so full at this point. My brother got the Vegetarian Combo of spinach, cauliflower, gumbo, turnip, and eggplants, which I wish I had ordered instead. The dessert was rose water pudding sprinkled with pistachio nuts, which was excellent. I got coffee and my brother got a tasty cardamon tea. We loved all the flavors in the food, especially the strong presence of cardamon in everything. It was a BYOY (bring your own wine) place; we were a little wined out so we didn't bring any, but there is a SAQ just on the corner where you can pick up some wine to bring to dinner here. Overall a solid restaurant, we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I had la table d'hote #2 with the lamp kabab. It was excellent. 

I am a fan of Kababs I can say that this is one of the bests I have had."}
{"text":"As someone who isn't vegetarian, but eats a lot of vegetarian food and doesn't crave meat I was DELIGHTED to find this place. First of all, who would expect to find Afghan food in Quebcoise country? Here's why I was recommend you try this place.

Amazing Location: We sort of stumbled upon it as we were exploring the Plateau neighbourhood (possibly my favorite part of the city). If you're a tourist (like we were), I definitely recommend going up to Mount Royal to get an eagle eye view of the city, then walking around the Plateau neighbourhood. There are a ton of really cute restaurants, bars, boutiques to keep you busy.

BYOB: There's a SAQ on the main street (2 blocks from the restaurant). So you can pick up some wine to enjoy with your meal. Yayy! 

Ambiance/Outdoor seating: The restaurant itself has a really cute patio (or as the people of monreal like to call it, terrace) , decorated in Afgani fashion. It's very romantic but also great for groups of people. 

Food: I think the biggest win is that you can find something that appeals to vegetarians and meatlovers alike. The vegetarian combo plate was plentiful and enough to share among two people. My friend tried the lamb kababs and said it was possibly the best he'd ever had.

Service was attentive. But one star off because the waiter insisted on being snobby and speaking in french - even though his english was perfectly fluent and he knew that not everyone on the table was from quebec. Ahh well. 

All in all, if you are looking for a delightful evening dinner and want to exeperience Afghan cuisine, then you should definietely give this place a shot."}
{"text":"This is honestly the food I've ever tried. 
It's very tasty and tastes homemade so you can tell it's healthy and clean.
Customer service is on point as well. 
Relaxing vibe always. 
Love afghan food!!!"}
{"text":"The only thing I'm not a big fan of is how crammed it was. We were a group of 4 people and we stuffed in a little corner at the back of the resto. I was a bit skeptical at first (the decor seems a bit out-dated) but once I took my first bite of stuffed pasta and filet mignon, everything else was no longer an issue. The food was fantastic. The waiter not so much but the flavors of my dish made up for it. I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Really friendly service, relaxed atmosphere, and situated on a cool part of Duluth by the park. As a group we tried a whole variety of starters, soups and mains, and everything was really lovely and unique. The red lentil soup, sambossa (filled pastries), spiced pumpkin starter, main lamb dish with raisins, that I ordered were all really good. And the various rices were also especially yummy. 

Really chill night with, again, great friendly service. It's BYOW too. Recommended."}
{"text":"I think the word for my evening spent at Khyber Pass was underwhelming.
The service was great and they didn't rush us out the door which was really pleasant. 

However, the larger dining experience was just less that what I expected! 
We all ordered the dinner plates which came with tri-coloured rice, salad and then meat or vegetables. My vegetarian plate was unmemorable. The rice was a great quality but really flavourless. The meat dishes were similarly nothing delightful. Perhaps I am unfamiliar with the cuisine but it's not food I would want to go back for. 

The decor is interesting and the BYOW is a plus point! Perhaps it's worth a shot - especially if you want to try a new cuisine (i can now check Afghani off my list!)."}
{"text":"Best Afghan food I have had to date! Between my husband and I, we ordered one Table d'hote #1 and a main dish separately. We shared the soup, appetizer and dessert from the #1 option. Strongly recommend the chicken dish called Mourg chalaw."}
{"text":"We went there on the first night of our week long vacation in Montreal. We found the food amazing, and  Zein-o-ddin (spelling ?!) was super warm and nice. We decided to go again, and the experience was negative. Mobin was cold and dry; he looked like someone had forced him to work there, even though he said he was the manager. We ordered our dinner, and Mobin suggested we were ordering too much food ?! We asked him to bring our order anyway. At the end, he brought us Ferni (dessert) which was very nice of him, however, my Ferni spoon had a piece of wet food stuck to it :( Asked for another spoon, but then the Ferni was old and tasted sour! 
Also with the business they have, it's not cool to mix the liquid soap with a lot of water in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Wow, I was really unpleased with my last two visits. Unfortunately the portion size of my favorite dal soup from here just keeps getting smaller each time I visit. I dont care if they are having problems in the back, I dont mind paying a few extra for a big bowl (admins over there please note :) ) Also, my last korma chicken was just not something I was used to from what I have from  here. Given the fact that yes I was with a big family group, and yes we were one of the last folks that night in, but still while the rest of the table was served with awesome food, my korma chicken was just not cooked enough. While I requested to get another one I could tell the chicken was not simmered in the curry well enough to get the full flavor. With that being said, I will still go back to this place with just less of the enthusiasm then before. But hopefully theres still hope :)"}
{"text":"La bouf est très bonne et savoureuse.. ambiance tranquille et chaleureuse.. apportez votre vin.. réservation requise.. prix raisonnable..."}
{"text":"We wanted to try something different in Montreal so we booked a table at the Khyber Pass. Not having tried Afghani food before we were a little apprehensive. The restaurant is small and booking is essential but the ambiance is wonderful. 

The food was probably one of the best meals we have ever had. The soup was incredible, and the kebabs and lamb were tender, flavorsome and not overly spiced. If you like your meat to taste like meat then this is the place. 

Oh, if we could only eat there every day!!"}
{"text":"It's fun to try a new kind of cuisine that is totally exotic to you.  You never know what exciting discovery you might make.  Case in point was my recent visit to Khyber Pass, an Afghan restaurant in the Plateau.  The restaurant is located right on Duluth and is a BYOB.  There is a SAQ Express a block away if you forget to bring a bottle with you.

The restaurant is pretty casual, cozy and the decor is Afghan-inspired.  The dining room is kind of small and crammed so a reservation would be wise.  There is also a terrasse come summertime and it is really nice and intimate.

Prices here are pretty reasonable.  You can get the table d'hote which gets you a soup or salad, choice of main and a dessert.  This was $30 and it gets you a ton of delicious food so it is hard to go wrong with it. 

For my soup I had the beef mashaba soup which contained beef, noodles and a variety of spices.  I really enjoyed the blend of spices as it was quite different from what I was used to.  This was followed by the korma chalaw which was lamb served in a tomato sauce.  The lamb was so unbelievably tender.  I never even used my knife to cut it up since it just broke away with my fork.  This was served with a side of rice done three different ways.  Once again everything was seasoned really well.

Dessert was a rosewater pistachio pudding.  Admittedly I didn't enjoy this part of the meal very much.  The pistachio overpowered the rosewater and I just wasn't a fan of it but then again I tend not to like nutty desserts so it was probably a question of personal taste.

If you're looking for a little adventure for a night then you should definitely come to Khyber Pass.  I really enjoyed stepping out of my comfort zone and being exposed to a new kind of cuisine. The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Honnêtement, depuis que je connais le Khyber Pass, je me sentirais mal d'essayer un autre restaurant afghan. 

Le Kabuli Palaw est tellement bon que j'ose pas prendre autre chose :)
C'est un apportez votre vin. Les soupes sont délicieuses, les choix assez diversifiés. L'ambiance plutôt exotique, et c'est plutôt relaxant.

Le restaurant a connu un boom de popularité dernièrement et je vous conseille vraiment de réserver assez à l'avance."}
{"text":"Very very delicious restaurant. You have to try out the lambs. With triple rices. 

It's a place where you can bring your own wine. You can have fun with your friends with your own drink. 

Sadly my colleagues and I didn't get the terrace. We could enjoy the sun and nice weather."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this little gem. Food and service is excellent! The lamb shank is so tender, served with perfect fragrance rice with spices."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on Mother's Day, expecting to see a lot of people, but it was quite empty and unpopular. We tried their specialty gigot d'agneau (lamb shank), which has to be booked two days ahead and shared by at least 4 people. Honestly the taste of the lamb was a bit disappointing because it was too dry and tasteless, so I actually have to dip it in the yogurt to season it. Before having the lamb we actually had the soup and some entrees. The taste of their beef soup was way too salty, lentil soup is okay but nothing special. Their entrees such as mandoo (Afghan dumplings), eggplant, pumpkin were fine, but we had the difficulty to finish and didn't want to waste. So when we started having the main course, we were half full already. My parents mainly ate the rice because they didn't like the other meat and vegetable. I don't particularly like Afghan food and didn't have any expectation for this restaurant. To be fair, it wasn't bad, but just not something I like and would want to come back for. The interior decor of the restaurant wasn't very aesthetic despite being exotic and ethnical, the terrace looks okay. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"A nice exotic restaurant! The lamp tasted so good! But rose water pudding was too sweet. The service was good. I like the exotic ambiance with middle-east style music and decorations. It's a good choice if you want to have somethings different than daily meal."}
{"text":"Wow. My first time trying Afghan cuisine and I am impressed! This place looks cool from the outside and inside. The portions are huge, you definitely need to come hungry otherwise you won't be able to finish your meal. This is one of those places where you can go with your friends or colleagues, date or family. It's a bring your own wine restaurant which is awesome as I do love my wine and it won't be too hard on your wallet either. So, yes, if you're in Montreal you should definitely put this on your list of places to go."}
{"text":"Me and my gf are in complete love with this restaurant. The food is always wonderful, and the staff always on their game. We make it a point to make a reservation here every time we come to Montreal. My gf gets the steak kabob, always cooked to perfection. And I have tried to different lamb dishes. Both amazing. We will continue to come here and recommend it to anyone going to the area. Keep yo the great work guys!"}
{"text":"I did not like this restaurant but I'm still giving it 4 stars!?! Why?
The food was fresh and well prepared... The only reason I did not like it was the spices that are used in that cuisine... I don't feel that should affect my review. However, the soup was very good. I also tried my friend's lamb and it was amazing, and I usually hate lamb.
Basically, get the lamb and you can't go wrong.
Tables are a little tight and everything feels tight, but restaurant has a nice vibe and service was good."}
{"text":"WOW! This place never disappoints. I've been about 4 times now and always leave satisfied. It's a BYOW so it's perfect for get togethers, birthdays, dates and more. Their food is very authentic and feels like a meal you're having from home. I would say the table d'hote is a bit pricey, but is acceptable because it is a BYOW. I think this is my favorite restaurant on DULUTH! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Fuyez cette place comme la peste ! Bien que la devanture soit attirante, tout le reste vous garantira la pire soirée de votre vie. Le staff est agité et peu attentif. On attend des heures pour être servi ou simplement avoir un verre d'eau. Les tables sont trop rapprochées les unes des autres et on entend toutes les conversations de tout le monde. C'est très bruyant et on ne peut s'entendre correctement. On doit alors parler assez fort de manière à ce que les personnes d'à côté entendent aussi nos conversations. Les tables ne sont pas propres et les plaques de verres sont mal fixées. L'intérieur est très humide est très chaud = manque de ventilation. Les couverts et les assiettes sont bas de gamme style cantine. La nourriture est plus que moyenne et n'offre rien d'exceptionnel. Bref. Pour ce prix là, je crois que je peux dire avec assurance que ce restaurant offre le pire rapport qualité prix de tout ceux que j'ai pu essayer à MTL."}
{"text":"Nothing more to add, it's cozy and I like the feel of the place.  Packed in that's for sure.  Rather difficult to have a quiet conversation when your sitting on top of each other.  The service was attentive and polite and did answer our culinary questions.  I'm not sure about huge portion size as some reviews indicated, I would say our kabobs were small 6 cubes of lamb , with 3 different types of rice.  The small salad on the plate was delicious but wished that was bigger and less plated to ce.  But, we did enjoy the experience.  Once was enough for me."}
{"text":"Fantastically Authentic. Bring your own wine.

Khyber Pass has wonderfully authentic cuisine. A bit cramped inside, and busy nearly nightly. Even for 7pm on a Tuesday there was a crowd, reservations are a good idea here. Despite that though, it's quite quiet inside and you never feel like you're sharing your table with your neighbors elbows.

The food is comforting and warm. My dining companion and I both opt'd the Table D'Hote #2. Her the soup Mashaba, myself the Maison. The Maison was a well spiced, filling, and warming red lentil dish. 

For mains, I had the Ashak, a Afghani dumpling, filled with beef, leak, topped with garlic yogurt and tomato sauce, all this served on three styles of rice. Savory and filling, the pasta shell delicate and thin. My companion ordered the lamb chalaw, a fall off the bone lamb shank, with rice and raisins, be warned, it is a bit sweet for the unsuspecting.

Dessert, a rice pudding flavored with rose water was a nice finish. 

It's short a star as the kitchen is a bit slow, but not obnoxiously slow. That said, this is by far my favorite location in Montreal for Middle Eastern Cuisine. If you're going to be in the neighborhood, and are looking for something to try, this is certainly worth it."}
{"text":"Soo soo good. What brought us to this establishment is their outside decor and what a good decision we made. 

In the back there is outdoor seating and inside is very cozy and homey. 

This is the first time trying Afghani food and it was very good. Most of their menu consist of kebab and lamb. Both my girlfriend and I had two different varieties of lamb. Mine was a leg of lamb which fell right off of the bone and my girlfriend had lamb in sauce which came with 3 different types of rice. Very good 

Just some advise get here about 30min before they close at 10p because we were not able to order the combo deals because either they did not have what we wanted or 2 the chefs wanted to leave so they did not make it for us. 

Even because of that I still give this place 5 stars because the service was good and even though they did not give us what we wanted they gave us an additional 15% off the bill. 

One last thing, the prices here are very accommodating and will not take a lot from your wallet but add a lot to your stomach."}
{"text":"It is interesting to be taken out of your comfort zone food-wise. Not everyone appreciates it but it's fun when I enter a restaurant of a certain cuisine and have absolutely zero idea what kind of dishes I can expect. This recently occurred for the event of a friend's birthday where he brought us to Khyber Pass on Duluth street for a little Afghan BYOW and for no other reason then simply \"finding the restaurant looked cool everytime I passed by\".

And indeed, Khyber Pass does look rather interesting from the outside and equally as much inside. Our table was located in their basement space which has been modelled to look like an cavern. It is a little odd - and because of the use of polycarbonate on the walls, a little hot - but it certainly fits the overall theme. Being in a smallish basement space made for rather noisy acoustics once the space filled up but otherwise no complaints!

I had never had Afghan food before, so I basically decided to work with their Table d'hôte and wing it! My friends at the table also having never had this cuisine before also decided to simply try stuff which allowed me to sample a bunch of dishes throughout the dinner. We are all curious to see!

First up, there were two soup options available - Mashaba soup and a house soup of red lentils and coriander. I went with the Mushaba. Composed of noodles, vegetables, ground beef, yogourt and fresh coriander, it was a nice way to start things off. A very hearty soup - tons of flavour through both the dark broth as well as the plentiful veggies and noodles.

I had one starter as well - the eggplant borani. Consisting of fried eggplant slices topped with tomato sauce and garlic yogourt, the texture wasn't necessarily as crispy as I was hoping but the flavour was all there. Lovely mixture of the sweet tomato sauce, the cool garlicky yogourt and spices overtop brought tons of levels to the party.

Ashak was my main of choice - Steamed pastas stuffed with leak, served with tomato sauce, ground beef and garlic yogourt. Again, I wasn't totally happy with the texture of the pasta - steamed but too soft and a little watery underneath - but flavour-wise, this was an excellent dish. The leak stuffing had a nice touch and kept the dish feeling light. Once again, the combination of the tomato sauce, yogourt and beef provided a nice addition and there was a healthy amount of rice and vegetables provided as well.

Among the other mains I tried, there was the Teka Kebab - filet mignon brochettes - which were nicely tender and flavourful. The Sabzi Chalaw - lamb shank with spinach - was a lovely cooking display of the lamb. Fall off the bone with that lovely lamb gaminess, the spinach didn't feel super necessary but it was delicious nevertheless. The last main was the Kofta Chalaw - beef meats balls in tomato sauce with afghan spices. A weirdly Italian dish to me but the addition of the middle Eastern spices provided just enough of a change-up to not make me wonder why I was not in a trattoria at that moment. All of these were served with the same amount of rice and vegetables as I got with my main so portion-wise, we all got our money's worth.

The last item for the night was our complimentary dessert of rose water pudding with pistachios. Now... I am not a fan of rose water as I have found that typically it is overused and just destroys any dish with its overtly flowery tones. However, in this case, count me as surprised to find that it was pretty good. Weirdly though, the entire table felt the pudding tasted like Fruit Loops! I guess I should check what goes into Fruit Loops. Anyway, texture was excellent on top of being a weird flashback to my childhood!

Khyber Pass was a very pleasant surprise - huge flavours and nice portions all around. The decor feels pretty hokey to me but I get it and frankly if the food is still enjoyable, I can look past it. Add the BYOW element - and believe me we did - and you have an excellent option for a relatively reasonable night out. Khyber Pass... you showed me what Afghan food was and I am happier for it.

Cheers!"}

{"text":"4 star for the food (the lamb sauce is good but a bit greasy) but 5 star for the affordable price tag, the beautiful terrace, the attentive service and the bring-your-own-wine setting with a SAQ 2 blocks away."}
{"text":"We came across the restaurant about 10 years ago after an Alouettes football game and after enjoying an amazing day at the game we enjoyed just as great a time out on the back terrace enjoying some cold beers (byob) and some fantastic food. I have since been back to the restaurant many times and it has become one of our regular spots. The atmosphere is nice and intimate and very cozy and the food never disappoints. I have at time ventured away from the table d'hôte but very rarely as you really can't go wrong with that great deal. 
I won't bother listing all the great items on the menu but I will say that the afghan dumplings are fantastic as well as the lamb shank and the meat balls. They also have a Lentil soup that is a great start to the meal especially on a nice crisp winter day.
Service is always very friendly and often comes with a little comedic relief.

A great place that has something for everyone. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I fell in love the first time i came here. The second time was ok. The third time was a brake up! Was it the fact that business isn't as good as before because of all the construction work done in the area? 

We each got the 30$ (29,95$) tâble d'hôte that consist of soup or salad, appetizer, main, dessert and coffee or tea. 
We also chose different dishes so we could share. The mashaba soup was very good. No complaint there. Then then mantoo. Beh... It was like eating over boiled dumplings where you had to look for the stuffing. The we got the lamb shank and the chicken brochette. The dishes came with a trio of rice that was flavourful but kind of dry but oily at the same time. An old batch perhaps??? The lamb shank was quite juicy and good but the chicken brochette was overcooked and dry... Nothing special to say about the dessert. I've had better. It was kind of too sweet for my liking...

The service was ok. Nothing out of the ordinary. It was slow paste. Good thing it's a byob and that we had two bottles of wine with us! Lol! 

Would i come back??? I don't think it's worth the detour and the hassle of going through traffic and searching for that miraculous parking spot."}
