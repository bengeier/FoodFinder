{"text":"Great gluten free pizza crust is available. I love he BBQ chix pizza so much have not tried others. Usually order wo bacon because tends to be a bit greasy w but that is just me. If your gluten free don't miss this one!"}
{"text":"The pizza is average at best. The prices are above average and the portion size is small in comparison to other shops. No delivery and I had to wait almost 45 min for pizza and breadsticks."}
{"text":"Great pizzas, I especially like the Sicilian style and killer sandwiches on awesome bread rolls."}
{"text":"You definitely get your money's worth, here, at Crust. My calzone was huge, the wife's salad, she informed me, was good, and she loved her bread bites. Yeah, you have to go to the register to place your order, and you have to get your own drinks (Given this, I thought it in poor taste to have a tip jar and a tip spot on the receipt), but it's certainly not a deal breaker. I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"We just went to crust. It is a new pizza shop in the neighborhood . We ordered 2 small pizza's (1 Da works and 1 white)and bread sticks.  Da Works was good but the white had too much garlic and oil. I would go back again but I want to try the hoagies."}
{"text":"These people run a good business. We just moved to the area and thought we would give it a try. Glad we did. They call it \"crust\" for a reason. The crust tastes excellent. At any other place my wife won't eat the crust, here she does. Overall the pies are great. This is our go to and favorite pizza place in the area now. Our first time here they gave us a free small pizza that we could take home and bake ourselves at a later time. The only drawback is due to the location on painters run road there is limited parking, which can be challenging on a busy Friday. Overall we love this place."}
{"text":"We just ordered a pizza and although the \"Crust\" was good the pizza was a big disappointment. We ordered a large with all mushroom, half pepperoni, half black olives. Everything was thrown in the middle. I hate pepperoni, my husband hates black olives. It was impossible to separate and the tastes were mixed together. The edges had nothing on them!!!!! LAST TIME TO GO THERE."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Crust last night and I had such a wonderful experience I must share with my fellow Yelpers!   The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere is pleasant. We ordered a cheese pizza, hot wings and garlic parmesan wings.   The pizza was 2nd best in the area to only Ill Pizzaola but that is a different, upscale pie. The crust was literally perfect. The wings were also cooked well and the sauces were each tasty.   You have a new Sunday regular in me!"}
{"text":"2nd best pizza in Pittsburgh(so far...). New to town and after 4 other pizza places this one is tip top. Went here after my aunt recommend. Awesome! Wait was an hr on Fri night...the only negative. Split a large with the wife and boys and I ate half. Bread bites are great!  We'll be back next week!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. We will never eat here. You should not eat here. They are so rude and unaccommodating. First, we wait 10 minutes for a parking spot. Once we get one the tiny place is packed - which is fine. BUT, next, we find out there was a table for 2 open (that we could take) that a family of 4 was squishing in at and WAITING for a larger table. So, instead of making the family of 4 get up (because they were waiting for another table - not the table they were sitting at) the owner wanted us to stand - when we could have sat at that table for 2 and ordered immediately. Doesn't make any sense! They are poor business people. If you are waiting for a table then stand! Don't take up another table that customers can sit at."}
{"text":"Ok... a friend of my Mother-in-law said this was the place to go. We ordered a large 4-Cheese and a Balboa.  Let me be honest: I've been lucky enough to travel the world and have kept a list of Best Pizza for over 20 years. I'm very picky and by now really can spot quality when I taste it.  The Balboa, after the first 1/2 slice, was easily in my Top 3... and for me, that's really saying a lot.  The sausage is perfect; not too savory, which complements the bacon and pepperoni just right. The cheeses melted just right and held the generous toppings together. The slice was oily but not too greasy. The crust is golden and sprinkled with cheese.  I can't really say enough about this pizza. We also loved the 4-Cheese and the bread knots... but that Balboa will have me coming back every time I'm back in the Burgh."}
{"text":"I 've had multiple friends tell me to check out Crust and now I'm addicted.This is now one of my favorite pizza spots in the 'burgh with some of the best Sicilian style cuts. I had a slice of the fresh Margarita pizza recently which I loved and the Steak Diavolo Sandwich (delicious steak, melted cheese, marinara, spicy peppers etc. on a nice crusty roll ) is a must. Crust! definitely wont be a secret for too long. Kudos on a job well done - will be back real soon."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza with unique topping like dandelion sausage. I would recommend this pizza place. You can either have them bake it or take and bake. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because we had them bake it and the pizza was soggy because the put on alot of toppings. Next time we will bake it. The crust was awesome. We oredered meatball that were very tasty. A great option. I also like that the pizzas were smaller."}
{"text":"Every item is delicious and fairly priced. You can expect consistency,  the secret to a successful business! Quality and quantity makes for many return visits to this neighborhood gem.  Friendly owners that appreciate your business ,is a rarity these days. Be sure to try the Bake Yourself Pizza, it's terrific. Wish they would take over the former Mexican restaurant property down the road!"}
{"text":"The best around, I can't get enough! I've open an small business near by and I just love the fact that I have such great food a few min away. They rock!"}
{"text":"I just tried Crust for the first time today and I am in love!  True to the name, the crust is crispy and tastes like a breadstick (they use parm cheese and garlic butter).  Prices are reasonable I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"What a great find! My family and I stopped here randomly on a Sunday afternoon. You walk in, order, and find your seat. It's a little small, so if they are slammed you might have trouble finding a seat, but we were fine. We seriously ordered so much food, and everything was delicious! The service was also 10/10! My husband took a phone call and didn't eat his soup right away and our server asked us multiple times if he wanted a new one so it was hot. She def went above and beyond. The pizza was excellent! I've also heard great things about their meatballs, so I will definitely be back to try those!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this little place! After passing it several times on my marketing trips, recommended by a patient, and having a coupon for a pizza in the Enjoy Book, there was no denying that I was going to pop in for a pizza.   I ordered takeout and when I called, my first impression was that the staff truly care about their customers! She was willing and eager to take my order, even after mentioning that I had a coupon. I ordered a large pizza with bacon and took it home to enjoy while watching the Pens game.   Needless to say, I was very impressed with their product. The place was packed, with limited seating, however many customers were getting take out as well. Our pizza was loaded with bacon, had a smooth tomato sauce, a lot of cheese, and a crust covered in seasoning. I have nothing but good things to say about this place.   If only they would open a shop the North... :)"}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN, Best Pizza in the South Hills! We stopped for lunch and left impressed and full!"}
{"text":"Our experience at Crust! was with their \"Take and Bake\" pizzas. OMG! They are AWESOME! I will never order delivery again! They make your pizzas fresh, place them on a cardboard round, with parchment paper and shrink wrap them. No pre-baked pizza shell, they use the fresh soft dough. Then, when you get home, you slide the pizza into the oven on just the parchment paper and it cooks perfectly! You can even freeze them (which we did). They are soooooo good! I particularly like their sauce. I have never dined in their restaurant, but that's about to change. If their pizzas are this good, I can't wait to try their other menu items. Quality ingredients and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Pizza and sandwiches never disappoint. Occasionally the pickup time estimates they give are off by 20 minutes, but the food is excellent. The bread bites are also to die for and so is the home made ranch dressing."}
{"text":"Crust is excellent!  Here's what I love:  The pizza is great. As expected, the crust is tasty. But they also do great with toppings -my pizzas are covered with toppings. The sauce is good tomato sauce, not overly sweet, which is good. I've had thick and thin and really like them both.   But don't miss their wings. They are the best I've had in a while. Well fried, so the skin is tight and almost crispy, then dunked in classic Buffalo sauce, they are just right. The hot/Buffalo sauce is not super hot, more like medium+, but just tastes right if you like proper, classic wings.   Their salads are fresh and large and they make their own ranch degassing, which is quite good.   The people who work there are just great. Friendly, helpful, and enthusiastic about their food.  The parking lot is a bit small, and some patrons double-park to pick up carry out, or try to park way behind me, near the street. Just look around before backing out and be careful."}
{"text":"As far as my family is concerned the pizza competition has been won by Crust. The staff is great, there are lots of great pizza options, and we love the take and make pizzas.  The only drawback is the parking could be better."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, delic! I decided to try Crust after reading the Yelp reviews. Hubs and I ordered a medium Sicilian for pick up. I was a little worried that the pizzas were all take and bake. When I called, I was informed that take and bake is optional for most pizzas but never available for the Sicilian. When I picked up the Sicilian, I was surprised that it was cut into squares and placed in the box. I guess I was expecting a constructed pizza. Maybe they had to put it that way to get it to fit in the box? Regardless, it was delicious. The crust was thick, crunchy and soft at the same time. The sauce was bright, tasty and plentiful. I love a saucy pizza. As I was chowing down, I was taken back to the streets of Rome where we bought squares of pizza for two euros and ate them while walking around the piazzas. Bottom line, the Siclian has stolen my heart and my belly for that matter."}
{"text":"Guys and girls at Crust... I completely misunderstood your coupon and you still honored what I thought the coupon was. I'm blown away by your service and Jesus Christ, your pizza is great, I totally get the topping per slice idea. Also... You should sell gallons of chili. Who ever is responsible for that chili needs to enter the South Fayette chili cook off. You just made a permanent customer."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance the try this place over the weekend.  I had heard a lot of great things about Crust.  While it was definitely a great experience, it wasn't by any means one of the best pizzas I've had.  My wife and I ordered a small pizza, an order of buffalo bread bites, and an order of the regular bread bites.  The pizza was just average.  It seemed to be a little over cooked and just did not live up to what I expected.  I will say the crust of the pizza was delicious.    The best part of the order were the bread bites.  Only one order would have been enough for us, as the are a half pound each.  I liked the buffalo ones best, my wife liked the regular.  They had a very strong doughy and garlicky taste which was different than any other type of bread stick or roll I've had.    The ranch dressing here ranks up there with the best in the Pittsburgh area.  It was a perfect compliment to the bread bites and the pizza crust."}
{"text":"The restaurant staff here are really a nice group of people.  As busy as they are tonight with phone orders and people at the counter, they took the time out to make sure that my visit enjoyable.  (We dined in).  The Sicilian pizza was terrific with a generous amount of toppings.    I also noticed that the restaurant is clean and tidy which is always appreciated.  Overall. Great job.   I'm a return customer for sure."}
{"text":"I find that when there's a huge build up about a specific restaurant or pizza place, I tend to be disappointed. This was not one of those times. Crust is everything I had hoped it would be and more!  While they have a small menu, it's very diverse and big on taste. I ordered their garlic bread bites, which people were raving about here on Yelp. You get dozens in an order baked perfectly, glazed in a delicious buttery garlic sauce. Tasty ranch and marinara sauce come on the side. Try eating just one of these-I dare you! They're perfect size for two bites. And there's plenty to share for a big group.   We also ordered the four cheese pizza. To be honest, I probably could've just eaten a cooked pizza crust with a little bit of olive oil and some Parmesan cheese sprinkled on it. The pizza crust is delicious, chewy, and crispy, making it the perfect crust to support the variety of cheeses, basil and roasted cloves of garlic that make up this mouth-watering pizza dream of cheesy goodness.   We ordered this via takeout, and the staff who work up front and constantly check on their tables of customers are patient, kind, friendly and helpful. One of them even reminded me not to forget my take out when I went to grab a fountain drink.  Among the down side (which is Why I'm giving four and not five stars) is the self-serve soda station. While I loved the option to add flavor shots (cherry, vanilla and more) I felt rushed to hurry up and get my drinks by a few rude kids of a family eating there, who were desperately trying to get as many free refills as possible. Another downside is the parking lot, which is small, and people tend to pin you in temporarily to pick up their orders.  Otherwise, anybody living within an hour of Crust would be crazy not to try out all the great things this place has to offer!!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try it for a while now as I've never heard anything bad and today was the day!  Super cute place with a good ambiance and exceptionally nice staff.    Hubby and I had the meatball appetizer, zucchini planks (new menu item) and a cut of pizza each.   The meatballs were excellent and the sauce on them very yummy!   The zucchini planks were tasty with the same yummy sauce!   We personally didn't like the pizza, but I think it was us and not the pizza.  The place was very busy while we were dining there.  I would go back and try other menu items."}
{"text":"Honestly the best pizza in the south hills that isn't Mineo's.  Fresh, hot, pizza.  Generous toppings.  Friendly staff.  Seating inside for folks that want to take their kids.  The only problem is that the wait time wasn't very accurate which was odd since I had gone on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"Went there last night with the missus & other family. Got lucky because we got a table immediately. Fridays are extremely busy.   I had a small Dandy Don, which had dandilion sausage (don't be scared, it was great), green & red peppers, & onions. OUTSTANDING!!! The missus had the Mediterraen, which had spinach, artichokes, & feta. Looked very good, didn't try it.   Only complaint would probably be a slight lack of parking, but the pizza was excellent. No alcohol, but BYOB is cool. They will supply wine glasses if needed.  Very nice people, too.  Almost forgot to tell you, there's only about 8-10 tables. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Their bread bites are amazing. I could eat the whole order ! Italian dressing for salad also good. I would say the pizza was average. Friendly service."}
{"text":"We live down the street and LOVE Crust! Everything we have had there is amazing. You have to try the cinnamon bites they are seriously addicting. Its nice to take out or eat in (when you can find a table), BYOB is a nice touch to be able to bring your wine. We normally get a salad to spilt and a basic pizza. We have tried many items on their menu and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza overall, probably the best in the Mount Lebanon / upper Saint Clair area. parking is a major hassle on weekend nights"}
{"text":"Wow! Great place. Love the pizza. Highly recommend. Decent prices too. Haven't tried they're other foods, but heard nothing but good."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the burg.  Garlic bites are great! And enough for 3-4 people as an app.  Pizza is nice and chewy with great flavor. Toppings are very generous.  Crust is what makes it social though.  Nice and chewy with a garlic park dusted crust.  It's called crust for a reason folks!!!!  Staff is super friendly and make you feel welcome and at home.  Well run business.    We are regulars and go there 3X/month on average.   One other thing that sets then sort is the consistency.  It always tastes the same!"}
{"text":"Can I just say best. garlic. bites. ever. OMG! If you go here you must try the regular bites and the buffalo bites! The marinara and ranch that was served with this was delicious too.  The pizza was very good. If you have the entertainment book, there is a coupon for 50% a one topping pizza. You cannot beat that! We had classic pizza with banana peppers on top. It was very good (especially dipped in that homemade ranch), however the crust was a little burnt while the middle did not seemed cooked enough.   Overall very good pizza! Not one of my favorites, but we will be back!"}
{"text":"We have been getting pizza and sandwiches from Crust for years.  The food is absolutely delicious and the staff is outstanding.  Parking isn't always easy, but it's worth it.  They're great about getting the order right, even when I ask them to add tomatoes to my pizza - but after it's baked.  A great place to eat!!"}
{"text":"Oh dear. Once again, I went in with high hopes and left moderately satisfied. I will echo that the place is aptly named... the \"Crust\" of the pizza is delicious! Otherwise, a very average pizza.  Inside is your standard pizza shop. A very narrow space; nothing to write home about.  Counter Lady was friendly although not very knowledgeable. (\"Do you have sun dried tomatoes?\" turned into a 5 minute ordeal.) Salad was nice and fresh, although it came with pepperoni as I guess I wasn't careful looking over the menu. (Menu in store is slightly different then the one on the on-line!) So their website is selling this place as a great \"Take and Bake\" pizza! Personally this option isn't that appealing to me. If I want a take n' bake I'll get it at the grocery store or Costco for half the price. The point of a pizza shop IMHO is, I feel lazy, order pizza, open door, open box, insert food. Crust is making it too complicated. Now this would probably be a place we used quite a bit because it's convenient location if it had delivery and inexpensive pies &/or weekly deals. None of that is currently happening so we'll keep giving our pizza business elsewhere. They DO offer pizza by the slice if you need a quick bite. My experience wasn't so bad that I won't check back in with these guys in a couple months and give 'em another try."}
{"text":"We were headed to the mall and decided to stop here for dinner. Pizza is one of my top 3 favorite foods. I read the reviews raving about the crust of the pizza. It is brushed with garlic butter and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.  We ordered a large Pepperoni and Black Olive pizza and 6 Parmesan Buffalo wings. The wings came first. The Parmesan cheese gave a weird texture to the wings. The inside of the wings were well cooked and still juicy. It came with a couple of sticks of celery and Blue Cheese dressing. Then the pizza came to our table. The crust did have the butter and Parmesan cheese. It had a lot of black olives and cheese. They definitely don't skimp on toppings. The crust was \"meh\". It didn't have much flavor.  The outside crust was very dense. Even with the butter and Parmesan on it, it lacked taste.  It was better than pizza from a chain but there are other family owned pizza places that are much better."}
{"text":"The best combination of food and service !!!  I stopped on a whim one day and it is my go-to pizza place 2 years later.  Great and friendly owners who aim to please. Always a friendly greeting and then I can't wait to eat any of their varieties of pizza. A must if you like pizza. Who doesn't?"}
{"text":"Wow! After intending on trying this place for a while now, I finally got a chance to with my son after his football game. The pizza was absolutely delicious! My new favorite pizza! We got the meat pizza and it was so delicious. No wonder they were packed here last night!!! As good as the pizza was, the service was just as great! Granted, we were the only ones there at 11AM at open, however, they were extremely kind and very welcoming. Refreshing to have a place treat customers like they appreciate their business. So happy I found this place, great staff and service, great employees and owner came over and ontroduced himself after he baked us an awesome pie. To top it all off, they game me a free \"take-n-bake\" pizza. Awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Generous toppings, gooy cheese with a crunchy crust.  Ordered on site for take home and only waited 15 minutes on a Saturday evening. A small cook at home pizza was added as a first time customer bonus. We will be back."}
{"text":"Okay lets be honest, from the outside it doesn't look like a great place you must try but it truly is. Hungry, I decided to try the \"slice\"  pizza that they advertised on a road sign. I found them to be VERY good. I went back the next day and tried the  \"diablo steak sandwich\" and found that too as a great meal. The staff was very friendly and remembered me from the day before. Nice job CRUST! Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Fist time to Crust the food was wonderful. Jimmy and the rest of his wait staff were top notch and we will return the next time we are in Mt Lebo. Thanks for having us. We have a 3 year old son who loved watching the pizza being made right in front of our eyes. We would recommend Crust to all. Jeff Serena"}
{"text":"These people get it. They know what they're doing and they make the customer feel welcome while they're doing it.   Crust is our new \"go to\" place for pizza in Pittsburgh. The convenience of the \"take and bake\" pizza works out really well for us and the ingredients they use are fresh and very tasty. Their instructions about how to cook their pizza at home will deliver just as good a pizza as you can make.   Five well-deserved stars to Crust. Keep up the great work and consider us a regular!"}
{"text":"Good Crust. Crisp and chewy crust with garlic butter and parmigiana cheese sprinkled on the edges. Friendly service. Nice tomato sauce that I would like more if it had a little oregano. Good toppings."}
{"text":"The pizza here is really wonderful, and sold by the sliver during lunch.  They also have sandwiches, wings, calzones, and take-n-bake, so you can stop by in your way home from work.  The staff is friendly the bathrooms are clean, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"THE FOOD IS AMAZING OMG. You get ALOT for your money, I can not stress this enough haha. We ordered too much food but we're not even mad. The staff are polite, and the food is incredible and HUGE."}
{"text":"I want to edit my review to add that we decided to give Crust another try at the insistence of my mother in law, who loves their food. First of all, the owner, Boo, was incredibly kind & apologized profusely about our first encounter (turned out to be a teenage staff member that had sent us away). She did comp our entire meal which was insanely generous considering there were four of us. Let me say, I am glad we gave it another chance! The food was great. My husband raved about his steak sandwich. This is the type of customer service that a business should extend to customers & will make me want to return. Thanks for giving us the chance to change our minds!"}
{"text":"I lived down the street from Crust! before they moved into the area and on a recent visit back to the neighborhood I checked them out because of a coworker's high praise.  Gotta say the praise is well deserved. The pizza is really good. Lots of flavor and the crust is perfection. Hence the name, I suppose. Also goodies on the menu are the bread bites that just melt in your mouth. I'm going to need to spend more time in the old neighborhood for sure."}
{"text":"Tried Crust for the first time and was not impressed, especially after an hour wait for a small and large cheese pizzas. The pizza was \"eh\" even our 16 yr old who lives on pizza wasn't that happy with it. There was not much flavor in the sauce, felt the added garlic and Parmesan cheese were making up for the lack of flavor in the pie. I think we'll stick to the other mom and pops shops in the area."}
{"text":"I'm from LI, NY and therefore have very high standards for pizza. This place is the only place in the Pittsburgh area that has good Sicilian style pizza. I can't comment on their regular slices because honestly the Sicilian is so good we've never tried anything else! The salads are also good and large portions. Good service too. The only negative is there is sometimes a wait for parking if it's packed. But that's understandable...."}
