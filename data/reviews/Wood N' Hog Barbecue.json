{"text":"Use you gps cause its easy to drive right by. So I prefer these smaller non commercial bbq places and was greeted here by the smiling owner Mike. We talked bbq and he gave me some samples.  The turkey tips were awesome. I also got the rib tips and wings. Both were fantastic. The tips had good bark and had the right amount of chew to them. The wings were big, cooked perfectly, and lightly breaded.  Their sauce is dam good too!  Best for carryout as they have no tables.  When Im back in town I shall return."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago so I know a good bbq joint when I taste it and Wood N Hog doesn't disappoint! I had my food delivered via Order Up and it was still hot when it arrived. Everything was prepared fresh and I like my food drenched in the mild sauce so that was perfect! If you're interested in Chicago style bbq, try this place asap and work your way around the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is worth seeking out. On a recommendation, I had the turkey tips, a new cut of meat for me and not something I'd usually get, and they were incredible. Served with fries and covered in mild sauce that had just a hint of heat, they were tender and juicy and delivered tons of great smoky flavor. I also tried a side of fried okra and really enjoyed it; the outside was really crispy and the okra inside was tender and delicious. 

Overall, this rivaled Black Dog for quality, which is saying a lot. One thing to note though, there's limited seating and it's next to the smoker, so it seems best to get your food to go."}
{"text":"Great place!! Great food!! The mixed sauce here is awesome. The turkey tips are perfect with the sauce. Love the place!!"}
{"text":"This's absolutely a gorgeous restaurant for a good experience! Guys there are friendly and very willing to give you little to taste. I'm recommending it!"}
{"text":"We have tried every barbeque place in Champaign-Urbana over the years. I don't know what took me so long to try Wood N' Hog since I had several people tell me to go, but we went tonight and ordered a bit of, well, a lot: Slab of ribs, fish, chicken legs, jerk tips, corn bread, potato salad and cabbage. (Next time we will try more of the chicken, the turkey, and the fried green tomatoes, but we already way over-ordered). We kept waiting to try something we did not like and it did not happen. The fish and chicken legs were very lightly breaded, but were not greasy at all and the seasoning was spot-on. The ribs were perfectly smoky, the (house-made) sauce was delicious and the jerk tips were tender and spicy. The sides were all equally delicious, and everything also came with fries. If we have any advice after one time it would be this: You get a lot food, so go easy if you aren't hungry, and they also are not shy with the sauce so if you want to really taste the smoke you might want to ask for light sauce. Also, this is not an eat-in place, so be prepared to place your order and take it to go (or call ahead and pick up). Finally - but not least of all - the owner and everyone who worked there were so welcoming and helpful, which is another reason to recommend them. We agreed that we liked this better than any other we have tried and this will be our go-to place for BBQ. No hesitation recommending it."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place and go whenever we can. They have really good customer service and Mike (the owner) is great! Every time we come, Mike remembers my regular order so I don't even have to tell him what I want! My go-to is the 1/2 white chicken with fries and mild sauce. My husband loves the turkey tips and says they rival one of his favorite spots in Chicago! You get a good amount of food for the price and we always have leftovers. I definitely recommend Wood n Hog! 

Expert Tip: If you're in a pinch on time, call in about 15 mins ahead of time if you're ordering chicken because it's made fresh to order."}
{"text":"Went in for some Jerked Tips today. Very good. I was kinda hoping for Jerk Sauce, but was informed that it's a Jerk Rub. All that said, I was happily eating over in Douglas Park. I'm happy they are there, though I will always want the Soul Food Sunday's that Pickens use to do. Can't get dressing anywhere now..."}
{"text":"Their Motto is: \"All Smoke No Joke\"

Wood N' Hog is no joke! Their ribs were so flavorful & smokey. I can taste the wood's smokey flavor! Furthermore chicken wings were great as well. While smothered in sauce, it's still crispy.

It's probably the best BBQ joint in Chambana!"}
{"text":"WARNING....
THIS IS A  PICK UP ONLY..
Not a full-size, sit down  restaurant. 

This reminds me of a terrific place in South Haven, MI called RANCH HOUSE RIBS....
Basic bbq here,  folks. Tips, links, wings, chicken, and sometimes they have pulled pork sandwiches."}
{"text":"Must eat here...Great place to eat every time I'm in town. Mike is awesome. Get the Turkey tips..."}
{"text":"I tried it for the very first time tonight and instantly fell in love! Delicious! The turkey tips are out of this world!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok so, I just left this place. I love the fact that its cooked to order and not just sitting around drying up like jerky the way Lil Porgy's does, I love that the rib tips have been SEASONED with a rub unlike LP.  I love that it's not overly cooked and burned like (you get the point) Lil P's will lose business as the word gets out about this place.  I ordered the turkey tips and they were good (a nice alternative for non pork eaters) but the traditional pork rib tips were better to me and put LP's to shame! Y'all go check this place out. Its in the hood so you KNOW it's good! ;)"}
{"text":"This place is delicious, but I'm more of a Black Dog kind of girl with the rib tips and other BBQ-ish items. No doubt that their fried chicken wings are amazing. They were super tender and moist with the perfect amount of dry-rub seasoning.

Don't expect a dine-in place - it's more of an order and pick-up restaurant."}
{"text":"My go-to place for bbq! Rib tips are fantastic and the price so good! We are definately addicted!"}
{"text":"Stopped here while in Champaign a few weeks ago.  The place is a little off the beaten path, but found it to be worth the trip!  I order the rib tips and also got some turkey tips based on comments left by others.  Both were excellent!!  It is worth mentioning that this place is carry-out only, but I would recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent rib tips! I look forward to trying out the rest of the menu which had some interesting items like fried green tomatoes and okra and turkey tips?! Friendly, courteous and reasonable prices. A little difficult seeing their sign but followed my nose and found it."}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch. Jerk tips are fire and I'd just tasted the Turkey tips at the counter with mixed sauce; sooo tender. Y'all missin out!"}
{"text":"I really never ate turkey products because no one seems to get it right for me buuuuttt that turkey tip is EVERYTHING.! And then they brought along the jerk turkey tip and now I'm in love.! The jerk tips are really good as well and its nice portions I eat A LOT so for half of a med tip to fill me up I feel like I'm getting my money's worth"}
{"text":"Best tips I have ever consumed came from this establishment.  They consistently boast incredibly tender meat.  My tip would be to call ahead and pick it up so you don't have to wait in the restaurant.  A friend and I stuck around while our food was being prepped and ended up smelling like bbq for the remainder of our day at work.  Also, it took about 15 minutes for them to prepare, so wasn't a great usage of our time.  Time is money, and so is this place!

Try it!"}
{"text":"So I'll start with the good.  Everyone who worked there was super friendly and competent.  The fried wings were crisp and the meat was juicy.  The sauces are delicious.  The cornbread is light and not to sweet.  The coleslaw, while on the creamy side, is pretty tasty.  

That said, for a place that calls itself \"Wood N Hog\" (emphasis on HOG), their pork ribs and tips were terrible.  Tough, bland, and overcooked.  If you look at the pictures, you'll notice the dishes are doused in sauce, which is really designed to mask their low quality cooking.    

Look, I get it.  I'm all for supporting local businesses and i hope they do well.  But their pig cooking technique is NO BUENO."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!! THE PORTIONS ARE HUGE. THE PRICES ARE EXCEPTIONAL. THE REAL DEAL FOR BBQ IN CHAMPAIGN/URBANA.


Not to worry about not being a \"real\" eat in place....this is what makes it unique.....quick friendly service. 

Each days BBQ cooking starts at 4am.....unlike many other places.


Great sides......!!!  Great cornbread.

I gotta try the smoked links next time

Go here!


M"}
{"text":"Ohhhh my!  Turkey tips!!! Corn bread is phenomenal...best in the midwest hands down!  Mild medium and hot bbq's are equally phenomenal.  

Not the best looking outside....But the food makes up for that time and time and time again!  Come you won't regret it...I promise.

No seating, call in and order or come in and enjoy the amazing smell of bbq!

Black Dog...step aside!

Disclaimer...Im a foodie from LA! And have eaten out in 7 major US cities, in case you were wondering about my palate"}
{"text":"This is family run business, keep it going guys! About the place it is a a takeout, not much of a dining. But the barbecue is really soft and tender and I think that's how barbecue meat should be prepared. I ordered the turkey tips, was really yummy and got the spicy sauce hottest one. For me I didn't feel it was too hot I think it was the right kind of heat and it worked well with the turkey. I do wish to see a dine in sometime in the future but I guess it's a young business and hopefully they can make it happen!"}
{"text":"Time sensitive issue...

I call my order in, fine 15 minutes and come and pick it up. So I make my way and arrive around the 15 minute mark.

I walk in, step to the counter and announce myself... I called in an order.

She says it'll be just a minute.

15 minutes later, I see the phone being answered and orders are taken... Ribs are being chopped, a few orders at the counter are taken. Wings going in and out of the cooker... 

I ask, about how much longer for my order ma'am? She points to the chicken in the cooker and says...it'll be about 10 minutes...

Speaks to a co-worker about the \"6 piece I told you about\", I interrupt and say... It's already been 35 minutes, I don't have any more time.

Jerk ribs and some wings, on a Monday, and it wasn't crazy busy.

And I now have no dinner... 

Some of us are on timed lunch breaks, I'm sure me standing there in this bright safety vest spoke loud enough.

If ya say it'll be 45 minutes, well that's the truth...if ya say... I completely forgotten about your order, that's fine... I could have went to plan b.

Don't just have a person standing there without a proper update."}
{"text":"Truly amazing barbecue in this place. Really friendly staff and good service. The turkey tips are my go-to item since you really can't find that anywhere else in the area. Really tender and pair well with the mixed bbq sauce. Very large portion sizes for what you pay. Great sides as well - okra and mac & cheese are both awesome. Location can be hard to find if you're not used to the neighborhood but keep looking because it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I told the owners I was from Kansas City, knew great barbecue, and was stepping out in faith buying from them because I had NEVER bought ribs in Champaign. I can say EVERYTHING was great!  Wings were cooked to order and were crispy and well seasoned. The ribs were meaty and seasoned quite well. Loved the cabbage and the baked beans, and husband enjoyed his pulled pork sandwich. I will return here to support this establishment in North Champaign. Full disclaimer:  I had them put the sauce on the side. Although their sauce is fine, we KC folks grew up on the sauce from KC, and added it to the meat. Did use their sauce for dipping the fries!"}
{"text":"Came up on Yelp when I hit the typical \"out of ends\" at the other BBQ hotspot.
Once again, Yelp hit the target with this one.

Small mom & pop (actually brother & sister) joint.
Has been a small line each time I have gone in, but Mike runs a tight ship - and a quick line...

PLENTY of Rib tip (ends) - BUT TRY THE TURKEY TIPS !
These babies will make you TOTALLY forget about that other joint !

Minimal choices on the sauce but all are great !
Fantastic DEEP smoke taste permeates everything (well except the Okra).

Great web presence and if you are in a hurry - call ahead and Mike will have it ready for you.
But you miss the back and forth banter and all the characters, like myself, that come in.

I REALLY hope this place makes it and judging by the customer's smiles after just one sample,
I would hazard a guess that is will be around for quite a while.

I know I will be going back once a week...

Note the address and the faded yellow sign in Google Street view.
It will help you find the place - if your nose somehow misses it !"}
{"text":"Love the food! Ive had their regular rib tips, jerk tips and chicken wings....i havent been disappointed yet! I hate the location but the food is always worth it. I do suggest calling in to pick up bc it could take 15-20min if they're busy. Try it today!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I had never heard of this place until a week ago and decided to try it for lunch.  Wow! We are so glad that we did! I ordered the chicken wings, fries, bread with the signature sauce and she ordered the small jerk tips with fries, bread and a drink.  We had it delivered and it was here within the 30 minute time frame. My chicken wings were nice and crunchy and just delicious. Her jerk tips were amazing! They had the right amount of smoke flavor and jerk sauce. She says they tickled her tongue!  We both tried the cheesecake for dessert, she had the raspberry and I had chocolate. The cheesecake was really good but we both expected the flavor of our cheesecakes to be what we ordered and they were plain cheesecake with raspberry sauce or chocolate sauce. This will not stop us from coming back! I can't wait to share this place with everyone I know who loves barbecue!"}
{"text":"I've lived in C-U for 50 years, so I've seen a few barbeque places come and go. There are several decent places going now, in different styles. Chicago, Texas and the Carolinas come to mind. It's not easy to do spareribs...I'm not talking baby backs, which pretty much any BBQer can do pretty decently at home. But spareribs are another story. You need to be able to take an untrimmed slab, remove the tips, the breastbone and flap, and rip off that silverskin. Then treat them really nice before they hit the fire. This place can do some spareribs! Just look at their menu and you'll see they're the real deal. They have everything a great shack should have, tips, ribs, wings, chicken, hot links and turkey tips. The sides are many and delicious, baked beans, slaw, okra, cabbage, fried green tomatoes, cornbread, and mac and cheese. I've only tried the Mac/cheese and slaw and they were excellent. I've had a slab and two sides delivered on two occasions, and both times their was no deviation in the ribs. I don't know whether I mentioned it, but these are the best ribs in town....ever. They are marinated and smoked perfectly, and covered with an ethereal sauce, not too hot, not too mild.  Goldilocks sauce. The bite on the rib is perfect. The meat doesn't fall off the bone which indicates too long a cooking time which makes the meat mushy. I ordered delivery both times, and they were right on time. The restaurant even called me a couple times to confirm the Internet order was correct. When I opened the delivery box, I was met with the slab of ribs already cut, with a pile of fries on top and then sauce over that. I thought it weird at first, but the fries soaked up some of the sauce and they were delicious by themselves. IMHO the best spareribs in 50 years in C-U. I'll be ordering often from Wood 'n Hog."}
{"text":"Sorry, YELP, you definitely failed me on this one. Turkey tips were fairly tender and decent. Rib tips were tough and chewy. Chicken legs were okay but nothing to go back for. It's obviously personal preference on sauce, but I found their sauce to be pretty bland. It didn't really have a BBQ flavor to it. Cornbread was kind of like cake but it tasted fine. I prefer cornbread that has actual corn in it. On a positive note, everyone working there was super nice. Unfortunately, I won't encounter them again."}
{"text":"I loved fried chicken but it's hard to find super juicy and moist, fried to perfection with perfect seasoning, the amazing fried chicken. When I saw this place on Yelp, I was shocked that how come I have never tried this place out?, then I realized(based on reviews) that it opened few months back only. My husband and I drove there to get some barbecued pork and fried chicken. Prices are reasonable with lots of quantity. I loved the fried wings, they were juice, moist and cooked to perfection. Their sauce tastes awesome. Barbecued pork was juicy, had great smoke flavor, again perfect. Now, this is my go to place for barbrque and fried chicken."}
{"text":"This is the best barbecue place in Champaign...hands down! Great service...excellent food...love the turkey tips and rib tips. Note, I fed a family of 4 with a small/regular size turkey tips order and medium rib tips. Nice sized orders. Now my tips: No seating...so call ahead and order to go. Easy in and out."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and hot! If you're missing that good Chicago style BBQ..... you definitely need to eat here! Love the fish and the sauce hits the spot every time!"}
