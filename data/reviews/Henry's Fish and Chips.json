{"text":"The place doesn't look five stars but the service and food is. It's a family run restaurant with wide variety on their menu. Their poutine is a must."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered a halibut + poutine (replaced the chips) and a basa + chips

They have haddock, basa, carp and halibut. Also has a family special (4 halibut+ chips +large gravy + large coleslaw for 46 tax included). Halibut+ chips = under 10 dollars (9.70ish), basa + chips is around 6.50 ish. You can replace the chips for poutine for an extra $1.70.

The fish pieces are good sized. Basa was quite thick (very good). Halibut was a good size. Very moist fish with nice fairly crunchy batter.
Fries are a bit soggy. Poutine is really good though and was a good portion (Don't mind the dark stuff on the right... that was an accidental pour of black pepper)

They provide small bottles of condiments at the counter. Tartar sauce came in small packets.
Both fish + the poutine and fries were enough to fill a pretty overweight me and my wife (Definitely not overweight but loves this stuff)

Environment:
Cozy, small, decorations are lacking and walls are bland. 2 barstools on either side with a few extra chairs laying around. We went at 6pm on a Monday and the place was quiet enough for us to have a nice relaxed conversation.
This place don't open on Sundays and is closed on Holidays. They do close at 7pm sharp and I think opens at 11am. 

The store is owned by a Chinese lady and her husband. Very friendly people who's owned this restaurant for 5 years. They put a lot of work into making sure their food is safe. This may not come as a surprise to others since food safety is something many of us take for granted, but  I was touched watching them inspecting and manually peeling all the potatoes to make sure it's safe for us to eat.

I want people to know that immigrant families do not have it easy coming to Canada and opening restaurants like this. Mom and dad forced to work in restaurants due to language barriers in order to make a living for their child. Many people may not like the hours and may find them not opened for long enough. I hope to relay 2 things: 1. Their food is good enough for you to make a special trip there. 2. Many of these owners are working tirelessly day and night providing a good service. They worry about their own health and energy yet put up a smile for customers everyday. If they can make enough money and be able to cut hours to make sure their health is good and they have a break, then I as a customer fully supports that and will work around them.

Overall, nice quiet little gem with good value for food. Wife is super happy we came here and demand that we visit again in the future."}
{"text":"this has been my family's go to spot for fish and chips fo the past 20 years. it's mostly a take out joint but they do have a small counter if you're there to grab a quick bite. walking into there is like going into a time warp back to the seventies with their vintage pop fridge and the wallpaper and the food and service is just as classic. 

like most fish and chip spots, it's family run and the ppl that currently run the place are quite friendly. the pricing is a little bit cheaper than average for a slightly larger than average piece, especially for halibut. the batter is not too heavy or too light but it's very oily if you're concerned with that. they got other grub too but i haven't checked it out yet."}
{"text":"The name says it all. Come in get fish and chips. Dont go at lunch because the local teenager's ram the place .I recomend halibut with poutine and adk for the fries extra crispy. Strictly for take out you would feel wierd and uncomfortable to eat there in my opinion"}
{"text":"Five star food in a \"a hole in a wall\".  Surprisingly busy for a weekday evening at 6:30pm.  You order and pay at the counter then your food is called up.  A few little stools and chairs to eat, but this is a take out counter.   THE POUTINE WAS AMAZING.  I'm a traditionalist when it comes to poutine, so I was surprised when I read it was a top 5 poutine in Mississauga when they serve it with mozzarella and not cheese curds.  But it was worth it.  $5.31 for a large poutine that I couldn't finish.  They layer the chips, gravy and cheese so it's gooey all the way through the box.  People were ordering fish as well as many coming in for poutine.  Delish.

My husband is British and was so excited when mushy peas were on the menu.  He said they were perfect and I had a small creamy coleslaw that was the perfect amount of vinegar to creamy on the veg.  

Worth the trip.  Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Been around for years. Although its not too fancy inside this family owned business has delicious fish and chips (I recommend the halibut) and my go to is always their poutine!"}
{"text":"Even before I went into high school, people were telling me how there was this awesome place for poutine near the school. At my high school, Henry's is a staple. You can't have passed through without ever trying Henry's and then getting hooked onto the deliciousness for a while. Freshman 15 isn't just for university.

The portions are huge and the prices are really good, but they've been raising them bit by bit so I suppose in a few years, this place will have to get by on loyalty and quality. 

One of the reasons why I loved going here were due to the owners. When you frequent a place everyday for a year, they start to remember you so after grade nine, when I go in, the guy would greet me and my friend by name and would already know our usual order (small poutine/chicken burger, medium gravy on the side, basa fish and 2 bottles of Coke). That kind of service is really awesome to get. 

Just going off on a tangent, that medium gravy on the side was strictly for me. My friend and I would split everything else but the gravy was mine. I drank it. Stop judging, seriously, this place's gravy is amazing and winter days are cold okay? The gravy warms my hand on the walk back to school. Stop giving the computer screen that look. Stop it.

Anyways, this year, there were this other couple working the store which everyone thought was weird, perhaps the owners were on vacation, perhaps these new people killed them in the deep fryer for the constant stream of customers (there is no end to the stream, really) but they're gone now and the visits are less personalized which I get sad about because I really do miss the owners. 

As for the decor, it's very old fashioned. Classroom styled desks, vintagey wallpaper (okay, it's possibly peeling, but I have serious loyalties to this place so I'm not really saying it's a downside) and they have these cute puns on the wall. Really, they aren't that bad. 

Definitely drop in for some poutine it really is delicious. Also, uber cheap, a small is under $3 and worth it for the quality and quantity."}
{"text":"This is not a five star place, but fish is five stars. Women on the counter was really helpful and friendly.

They also have variety in fish. Enjoy your meal"}
{"text":"When you come to Henry's, you get value.

For the low prices they offer, the portions are great. 

It's known locally not only for its fish and chips but also for its poutine. Don't expect a variety of flavours like all of the more modern poutine establishments, but do expect it do be done right. Fresh cheese curds with a slight crisp to their fries. 

Henry's is essentially a takeout only place, with very limited seating (one counter, a few stools). Whatever seats they do have are often occupied by the many teenagers that go to Henry's as a hangout spot. 

The owner's have been there as long as I can remember, and they are as nice as can be. I'd definitely recommend Henry's as one of the top spots in Mississauga for fish and chips and poutine."}
{"text":"Good but only for the haddock and the cod they over cook some of the other varieties of fish."}
{"text":"I had the chicken burger with fries  def greasy, I could smell the oil. Soggy chicken Patti & fries, def never again. The fish is full of batter not much fish, if I wanted a doughnut I would rather go to a  shop. absolutely sucks!!!!! Highly not recommended. Save your $$$ pls go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been going to Henry's since I went to highschool in the area! This place has fish and chips but the most popular menu item is the poutine! For $3 (small) you get a sizeable amount. The fries are thick cut, the cheese is shredded mozzarella (not traditional cheese curds but STILL really good) and the gravy is amazing! I always put Cajun seasoning and sriracha on top. The two owners are such sweethearts and the lady who takes the orders always has a smile on her face. Definitely come here and try the poutine! 

Tip: they also do 1/2 poutines, which is half the size of the small. It's not on the menu but you can just ask for it!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place probably over 100 times and it's always been my go-to for poutine. 

It's located near a high school so I don't recommend going during lunchtime on weekdays. If you go at any other time, it'll be a reasonable 5 minute wait for poutine. 

Almost everyone goes for their poutine. The serving sizes and taste are amazing and the prices are cheap too. Honestly I've had poutine from a lot of places (NY Fries, Smokes Poutinerrie, etc) but this place is still my favourite due to the taste and price of the food. 

As for the place itself, it's small and a bit old-school. There aren't many places to sit inside so I recommend just taking it to go. In fact, the food is all served in to-go boxes for that purpose.

The owners changed around 2-3 years ago but they've always been so nice and friendly."}
{"text":"wow, i'm surprised there aren't more reviews. admittedly, i've been here only once, but this hole in the wall joint has surprisingly AMAZING fish and chips.

i don't know why, but damn, perfection is made here!  nice crisp delicious, authentic tasting fish and chips.  downside, the location is pretty much in teh middle of nowhere in a strip plaza. the interior is well, really drabby. withschool chairs that have the table and chair as one piece. and really,really due for an interior update.  definitely not a sit in place. more made out to be a takeout joint.

we just came across this place since i was getting the car done across the street.  (which btw, is amazing mechanic! - real friendly and authentic) 

all in all, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had the halibut and chips ($10), with a side of large poutine (about $5.50). Coleslaw was an extra dollar but they give a reasonable amount and it's homemade.

The portion size is huge for everything! The halibut tasted good, along with the fries. However, the real star of the show is the poutine. They double layer the cheese and drench the fries in gravy. They give you so much, you cannot close the box. They have to wrap the open box with paper. Amazing tasting gravy and I was told the fries and gravy are made in-house.

The portion size makes this place a great value. I wished they made their own tartar sauce, considering nearly everything else is made in-house. I will definitely be back to try the other fish on the menu, and definitely with an upgrade to poutine."}
