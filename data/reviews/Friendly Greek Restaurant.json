{"text":"When they say Friendly Greek, that's not a lie. The service was great, and well, friendly. Food was great as well. I shared an order of calamari and a gyro meal with my wife. It was more than enough, and it all tasted great. It's right across the street from a Yuk Yuks, so it's a great place for a pre-show dinner. Would love to go again!"}
{"text":"Most of the food quality was pretty good, but service was very iffy, and prices weren't the best.

Before visiting the venue, I checked out their menu at http://thefriendlygreek.com/Menu.pdf on their site, and I really liked the prices as well as a bunch of things on their menu. That menu however seems to be outdated, as everything is much pricier on-location, so that was a big disappointment.

So m'lady and I were heading to this venue with a group deal. I realized that we needed a reservation when we got there, so I called them from my cell at the parking lot asking when the soonest reservation available was. The response I got was that the latest I could come in was in a half an hour. I asked when the earliest I could come in was and the person on the phone kept telling me the same thing (kept repeating \"latest\") and said that they had a big group currently. I could see through the windows that they had quite a few available tables, but I let it go and went ahead with the reservation.

When we got there, we noticed a sign on the door saying that for people with group deals, we had to have a reservation and hand the group deal to the host(ess) before being seated. When we got to the sign that said \"wait to be seated\", the hostess came over to us. I told her we had a reservation under my name and tried handing her the group deal voucher as mentioned on the sign. She ignored the voucher and sat us down. We then had 2 waitresses fighting over who should serve us.

There was an issue with my drink where they ran out of iced tea and said they would replace the bag at their fountain. Then, they were unable to find the bag to make more, so they gave me a can. I never got offered a refill :-/

Aside from that, our calamari had something that looked like plastic in it. When I told our server, she went to the manager (who seemed to also be the cook) and he said that that was a part of the cartilage. I Googled \"calamari cartilage\" and it turns out that removing it is a part of the process when making calamari.

M'lady tried to order 2 different \"vegetarian\" dishes, both of which they said they were out of the ingredients to make. I really wanted something with mushrooms which they also told me that they didn't have any :-S

We were served our Saganaki Opa with no side-plates, so it was a bit tricky to eat. We ended up asking for side-plated when our calamari came.

So all-in-all, our experience was very poor. We also saw some people who came to pick up some \"to-go\" food they had ordered on the phone and they had forgotten to make it. It sounded like that wasn't the first time that these people had this kind of experience with this location.

I'm definitely not going back at the very least to this location of Friendly Greek based on this experience."}
{"text":"It's okay, not terrible, but only get +1 star for the very generous portion size. 

For $15.95 (quite pricey if you ask me) you can get a souvlaki meal, with soup or salad, (it's big), rice+ potatoes. And breads to dip in olive oil. 

After the soup, I was stuffed and could barely finish my entree. 
My friend told me the bread was a little stale. 

I got the lamb, and I found it a big dry, and flavourless. Maybe because I had it well done. 

In terms of service, they were fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Pretty quiet when we got here on a Friday evening. Ordered a Chicken Pita combo (salad) and a large Chicken Souvlaki Plate. They promptly took our order so no complaints. Just a bit of a wait considering noone was in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The Friendly Greek is indeed friendly, very friendly.  The woman that took my to-go order was super sweet and patient (it takes me awhile to place an order sometimes, can't be helped when everything looks so tasty).  The menu had a lot of options, with some daily specials.

I ended up ordering the 3 grilled meat combo of beef, pork and chicken (I think), which came with a salad, bread, lemon potatoes and rice.  I have to say sounded like a lotta food and it indeed it could have easily fed two people!  The potatoes are WONDERFUL.  I don't know what's in them but they were delicious.  The food was fresh and made to order.  

I was there on a Wednsday evening and the restaurant was half full.  People seemed to be really enjoying themselves and in no rush to leave.  The staff there treated their customers like family.  A few people came in for takeout orders.  There was plenty of parking outside.  

A great place for a good solid meal with friendly service.  You cannot possibly leave hungry!"}
{"text":"Nice enough place for a bite to eat before heading across the street for comedy.

Food was decent, service was fine... nothing outstanding or poor. A-OK."}
{"text":"My wife always says, when you pull into a parking lot and no cars are there, it's not going to be a good place to eat.  I need to listen to her more often.

The best part was the saganaki, but I've had better. 
My kids wouldn't eat anything they ordered.
The wife and I got a souvlaki combo platter and I was surprised that it only had 3 skewers for the price.  They try to fill you up with potatoes I guess.

The beef was charred, the pork was fatty and the rest was below average.

My kids really did enjoy the all the ants (yes, ants) all over the floor, it kept them busy for a while."}
{"text":"Hands down this is my favorite place to get a Greek Salad and  I've tried many in the GTA.   The Gyro is a favorite along with the chicken sticks and salmon.  This place has awesome table bread I've never had before.  I never have a problem with service here.  I frequent this place every time I'm in town.  They have a couple of TVs and you might find a game playing.  There is almost always Greek music playing.  This is not your fine dining experience, instead it is a relaxed and friendly atmosphere.  You can take your family, friends or casual date."}
{"text":"I wasn't completely impressed by this place but I guess you get what you pay for.

I had the Mediterranean Chicken Wrap. It was decent and had a good amount of chicken in it. The waitress was good, but nothing outstanding.

Since my office is close by I may come back here some time in the future for lunch, but it won't be high on my priority list."}
{"text":"They recently had a reno and I think ownership change..HORrIble last experience.  We waited 10 mins at lunch to be seated then finally grabbed menus and let the hostess.know we were grabbing a table..she seemed grateful and said great thank you.  Then waited 17 minutes ..no waitress even said hello to us ...passing us by several times, she never said or featured anything.  So we left.  Shame as this used to be a favorite.  Now were forced to go to Carljngciew to get our Greek fix taken care of"}
