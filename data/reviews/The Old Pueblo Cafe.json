{"text":"This is Litchfield Park's version of Cheers. Great food, amazing staff, perfect place if you're a local because you'll run into someone you know. Even if you're visiting, everyone is friendly in The Park. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Bartender are super Rude !!!! And they take for ever to bring you a drink that is if u lucky enough to get service . And they get mad if you don't tip  Them but why would u tip for a horrible  service We never going back again !  Taps next door to them is way nicer and they always give you a great service super cool people and the food is great .don't waist you money here not worth it."}
{"text":"My partner and I were staying at the Wigwam and wanted something close to the resort. The Old Pueblo Cafe was a brief five minute walk right across the street.

When we arrived we noticed a \"closed\" sign in the window an hour before the advertised time. After some initial confusion, an employee spotted us and explained that they were still serving food next door. We sat at an outside open bar, still unsure if we were in the right area. After a moment, the wall opened to reveal a \"secret passage\" rotating wall-door, and the bartender emerged. No joke!

She was friendly and brought us full menus and offered us drinks. The House Margarita and Long Island we ordered were decent but priced pretty well. The food came out within minutes and was hot, tasty and in large proportions. The Fish Tacos I had were fresh and delicious! Highly recommended.

If you're looking for a great place to stop and eat while at the resort, you need to check this place out."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona!  Great food, drinks and really unique and nice atmosphere.  However, tonight's service was not on par!  Our server skipped me when going around the table to take orders and then she left quick.  When something was said when the food was brought out she told me she thought I wasn't eating.  Well, I never said that I wasnt eating but did say I was not drinking.  Either way, as a server you should never assume. 
Then when I paid for my diet coke. .. $2.45, I gave her a $10 and she brought me $7 even back!  (Do the math) granted .55 is not a huge chunk but that is not right!  
I was very disappointed, then when we asked who the manager was we were told it was that young lady who was our server. . Of course."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's within walking distance from my house so my husband and I will walk over there and have a few delicious \"Mexican Icebergs\" while relaxing at one of their patio tables. Chips and salsa are good and so are there shredded beef tacos!"}
{"text":"We had such a blast here. Love coming for the kareoke. It's a lot of fun and the staff is great. However.... at the end of the night our bill ended up being 300 bucks for 6 rounds of drinks with no food. And instead of letting us know how much our bill was getting up to they decided to be selfish and just hand us the bill at the end. They are way too expensive.  14 bucks for one drink depending on the drink"}
{"text":"Lively Friday night just enjoyed good Mex food. Chimichanga was really hott had to wait to eat it  :-( taco salad had strange lettuce like Arugula...not very mexi in my opinion. Inside lighting was like a living room kinda strange. Sit outside next time. 2 meals and a drink under 30 can't complain too much! Would return."}
{"text":"I do not like this restaurant. Have been here 3 times and it never gets better. Food not good. Service not great and too loud. I don't get why people like this restaurant, but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Our favorite hangout, we even used them to cater parties.  The hot salsa is simply the best.  Sonoran Enchiladas are my personal favorite though I haven't had a meal my wife and I did not like.  Patio/Bar atmosphere reminds us why it's great to be in AZ and  when it's too hot we can head indoors or do take out.  Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Extremely impressed! Excellent service, very tasty and authentic. I would highly recommend it..."}
{"text":"Visited the Old Pueblo for lunch. I had high expectations as was told this was a great place to eat. I ordered the Machaca with rice and beans. I received what looked like a small piece of shoe leather. The taste was ok - but I have had better. Since I am an artist and feast with my eyes first, the appearance of the meat really affected my ability to eat it. It it weren't for the rice and beans helping to cover it up I don't think I could have eaten it. The price was pretty high for lunch - both of my children also ordered lunch and they only ate part of each meal. I don't allow my kids to be picky eaters - the rule is if they order it they have to eat it. I tasted both of the dishes they ordered and both were bland with hot chili sauce the main ingredient. 

The best part of our meal was my friend's margarita (which I sipped on). I could not have one of my own because I was driving."}
{"text":"Love this place! It gets a little busy sometimes on the weekends but the food is always awesome. Great tacos and chips and salsa are always good."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! Great service, great food, and a causal atmosphere. It's the best Mexican food in town. A previous review said they only serve Tabasco as salsa, that's completely false, they serve fresh homemade pico and a spicier sauce if you want something hot :) it's really yummy to mix the two :) We go just about every week, the prices are reasonable especially for the quality you get. They get busy during the spring because people are on the patio enjoying the weather, but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, the prickly pear margarita is great but you have to try the spinach enchiladas... Yummy! Good job, keep up the good work"}
{"text":"My wife and I and our best friends love old Pueblo.  Julie, Mary Anne,  and Tara are absolutely wonderful.  This is our home town hang out.  It's nice to walk in. .. see familiar faces and three wonderful bar tenders who are attentive, and kind and have been here long enough to consider them family. They make Old Pueblo what it is.    We love ya'll."}
{"text":"We have tried and tried to like this restaurant. Decent atmosphere and decent food. There really are not any great Mexican restaurants in goodyear, in my opinion. The service here has always been so so. I try to keep in mind that most of there staff are young teenagers. More so the problem is that they are always poorly understaffed. This last attempt was the last. Waiting an hour for our meals when it was not that busy. No refill on chips or salsa, our drinks? We sat for almost an hour without drink refills, including water. I noticed others going to the bar to get there drinks because the service was that bad. 

This is an update to the above review. Peter, the owner emailed me and apologized for what happen. He also explained the circumstances that caused the problems that evening. I appreciate the response and we went back last night and had a good meal and a nice time on the patio. Thanks Peter."}
{"text":"I generally rate mexican food by the taste of their beans and rice, but everything I have had there is exellent.  Tacos, enchiladas, burritos, and yes, terrific beans and rice.  Combine that with rich historical background and freindly attentive service and you have a top notch resaurant in the west valley.  

BTW, the margaritas are the bomb."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the food, very poor quality. The service was even worse, our waitress was at our table only a few times and we had to often flag her down for help. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"First class experience.

The outdoor seating was perfect.  Went on a Friday night and the place was busy, but not over packed.

Got seated right away and our unlimited chips and salsa and drinks were brought ASAP.

The carne asada nachos..... top notch. I really love my nachos.

The nachos were so good that I had to get the carne asada dinner as well, and as I had hoped, it was delicious.

Great food, great atmosphere, great mexican dishes. I recommend this place and will be back soon."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch and beat a sizable crowd.  Based on that there were high expectations for the food.  Unfortunately what we got was the worst green chili Chimichanga ever.  Although it was properly cooked on the outside, the filling was totally tasteless and thin.  The service was good and there was a crowd so it may be a fluke that our chimi was so bad but we cannot recommend it based on this initial experience."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Had a chicken chimichanga. It was to die for. Sat outside. Nice weather. Service great. Glad I turned to Yelp for this one. Try it. You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! Service is great and the food you'll crave all week! Especially the spinich enchiladas! We are there at least twice a week if not more"}
{"text":"I have never had mexican food that can beat Old Pueblo's! It is the best, hands down!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna keep this short and simple, you'll find good food here. This is my favorite Mexican restaurant around. The chips and salsa here are great and I've always had good service. I will be back for sure for my tacos and margarita."}
{"text":"Our first time here. The service was slow, there was a waitress trying to help out our waiter because he didn't bring us drinks or salsa and chips because he was to busy mixing up other tables' orders. We finally order our food after what felt like forever. And when we got our carnitas plates it literally smelled like cat food. Didn't look or taste like carnitas so i just ended up not eating it. I had so many high expectations going into this place especially since i'm not from Arizona . But left so disappointed. I would never come here again. Everyone looked like they hated their jobs and didn't want to be there. This is not authentic Mexican food. You'd be better off going to chipotle in my opinion. At least your food wouldn't smell like cat food then."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local Mexican place - great chips and pico de gallo along with good fresh food.  At lunch I like the #1 combo- taco, enchilada, rice and beans.  I don't order bean very many places-- these are so good that I will order them as a dip for my chips!  Friends like chimis and tilapia too."}
{"text":"I'm Addicted  to  the  chips and salsa!  Chicken  Tacos dinner  plate is Awesome!! It is  a hidden  treasure in Old  Litchfield!"}
{"text":"This place gets an A for awful. The only menu item of note was the poco de gallo. Very poor balance of seasoning on everything. Stale tortillas on the wet tacos. Even the beans tasted musty. Top it off with terrible service. It's a bomb."}
{"text":"Great time! 

Showed up late on Friday only to find live music and great outside dining.  Margaritas were good! I had the  enchilada trio and my boyfriend had the steak plate. We enjoyed both and walked away satisfied."}
{"text":"Service in bar area horrible! Disorganised had 4different servers.  Carnita lover these by far the worst I ever had! Just there way of getting rid of there barboca. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!! TACO BELL BETTER"}
{"text":"Don't know what happened to this place on Mother's Day, but it definitely missed the mark today. Not very busy and we were seated immediately. Took a while to get our drinks. Weak margarita but awesome chips, salsa and guacamole. They were out of the meat needed for the dish we ordered.  We ended up leaving without ordering a substitute."}
{"text":"First time visiting this establishment, no need to wait to be seated we sat where we wanted to. Our waiter Jose was very attentive and polite. The pico de gallo that was served the chips was fresh and very good. I ordered the fish tacos that were great and my wife ordered enchiladas which she enjoyed. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great experience! The staff was making sure everyone was well taken care of.   Food was amazing, hot and came out fast.  We're definitely coming back."}
{"text":"We have tried several Mexican places since moving to the area and we have finely found the one! So good! It's located in a great area of Litchfield Park that has a small town feeling to it. There is a nice patio area outside. Inside isn't fancy, but that's ok. Food is amazing! The only thing I don't love is the salsa. It has good flavor but is a bit chunky for me. But the best part by far is that they don't use nuts in their sauces! My son has a life threatening nut allergy and most Mexican restaurants are not safe for him. This one is!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican food places. Great everything. Green chili quesadilla, street tacos, enchiladas, everything on the menu is delicious. Homemade chips and salsa comes to the table. Their skinny Margarita is the best. Good kids menu."}
{"text":"Excellent! I would drive out here everyday to have lunch.  It's still a small town atmosphere and i love it here!  The chicken ceasar salad is amazing! Thank you Peter Mahoney! !"}
{"text":"Place is great!!! Margarita's are fabulous and the band that is there from time to time makes for a fun environment.  I am new to Litchfield Park but I love the area and this place.  Will be going back again soon!!"}
{"text":"We were in AZ visiting out for Thanksgiving and really wanted so go AZ mexican food but had to go to a place with a full bar for some Margaritas.  This place came up on Yelp and looked interesting so we figured we would give it a try.  The food was pretty good.  My son had a cheese crisp, wife had beef enchiladas and a chicken taco, Mother-in-law had pork tamales, and I had the beef green chile.  They gave us to big baskets of chips and salsa (which we eat too much of!).  Everything was pretty good, but the margaritas were really good.  I always try the house first time I go someplace since I think it is a good judge of how good a place is and theirs did not disappoint.  I think they should advertise them more because they are so good.  Very fresh tasting!  Next time we go back to AZ we will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"The service sucks. The food is ok. Don't let the good ambience of the place fool you. The only good thing is the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Old Pueblo is my go to for Mexican food. They have awesome carne asada and the carnitas plate is really good as well. 
Great for out door eating! Love the atmosphere!
Ordered tamales from her for Christmas and they were delicious. So good we ordered extra to give to some families as gifts. 
It's a must eat for Mexican food in the west valley."}
{"text":"Amazing service from Jelly for lunch today, and seriously good food!  A wonderful hot sauce with heat and a great pico start things before you even get to sample the tasty tacos and enchiladas.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food. Very casual, almost to the point of seeming like a self serve place, but there was table service. Not a ton of atmosphere, but service was friendly and food great. Mexican flag enchiladas were very good and chips/guac/salsa addictive. Full bar too, so being able to get margaritas was a plus too."}
{"text":"We were looking for Mexican food in the area, this place got great reviews so we thought we would try. I agree, the pico de gallo was very good, I like that it wasn't loaded down with onions like most mexican places do. I also like that the regular salsa came in a squeeze bottle, that made apply to food super easy. I ordered the Chicken Chimichanga, rice and beans. The Chimichanga was very good, not dry like many can be. It was large and very moist, reminded me of chicken pot pie without the veges wrapped in fried flour shell..yummy! I didn't like the rice so much, had a little to much red enchilada sauce flavor for me, but I don't like red enchilada sauce. The other item we ordered was the Beef Taco Salad. We expected Ground Beef and were pleasantly surprise to find Steak. I would give it another try and go for the Faijta's next time, a table close to us got them and they smelled very good!"}
{"text":"Came in after probably a year without eating here on a Saturday morning to watch the ASU game at open. It took four employees 20 minutes to figure out how to get the game on, terrible service, mediocre food at best. I always spoke highly of this restaurant as my daughter goes to school across the street. I won't be back."}
{"text":"First time and we will return!! Yummy chips and pico. My husband loved his chicken enchilada and my fish tacos were delicious ! Service was excellent! Nice to find a local place that is good!!"}
{"text":"Great food, Great value and one of the best locations on the West side. It actually has some character, which is pretty rare in the strip mall/franchise world we live in. The Bar is great, It's one of the original building from the early 1900's when the WigWam was built."}
{"text":"Best Mexican  food I have ever eaten. Fresh and yummy.  Carnitas was great. \"Jelly\" the waitress was awesome.  Helpful and responded promptly. Great price for wonderful food. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Awesome service and a great Happy Hour. Nicole was great. Highly recommended! Try the Fish Tacos on Tuesday."}
{"text":"Went to TOPC last week with my 80 year old grandmother. This is her FAVORITE place. She loves the bar because it has an exciting energy. 

The beef tacos and chile rileno was delicious. The staff was friendly and so accommodating."}
{"text":"I've been to Old Pueblo more times than I can count. Hands down the best chips and salsa I've had. Ever. The staff is friendly and attentive and the food is fantastic. My favorite is the carne asada and I always have enough for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Good option when you need a break from the food at Wigwam!"}
{"text":"We drove 40 minutes to get here and were not disappointed.   Food was great and staff very friendly.  Great margaritas.  This is our new spot.  Worth the drive."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recomended to me so I took my wife & daughter here for my wife's birthday,
My daughter loves street tacos, they had them, she ordered them she picked through it & never ate one & said it made her nauseous. My wife & I both had the Barbacoa, \"mexican style bbq beef. served with a flour tortilla\". It had enough salt for a year in it, also in the beans & rice terrible. My wife tried to drown it down squeezing lemon juice on it. I'm writing this review the next morning & my throat still is coated with a salty taste. This was some of the worst food I've eaten, & coming from a former 70 & 80 era Marine that says a lot. Good note was that the Raspberry Ice tea was amazing. I would never expect to go back there again if for some reason a business transaction leads me back...\"Hold The Salt, all of it, no salt on any thing."}
{"text":"Went there about 4PM on Sunday afternoon 2/15/2014. Got menu's and chips but that was it. Several young ladies came by to ask if we had been helped and we told them all \"no\" but that didn't do any good. After watching several folks around us who came in after us get their drinks and have their orders taken we just got up and left. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times because it is so close to home.  I have had the enchiladas and the tacos.  Both were good, but I preferred the enchiladas.  The salsa is made fresh and is excellent. It's actually one of the main reasons I go there. Outside atmosphere is great unless the bar next door has karaoke or live music making it difficult to have a conversation."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I will never eat here ever again. My husband and I both ordered the 2 enchilada and 2 taco plate and we hated it. They add way to much salt to the enchilada sauce and rice. The chicken in my tacos taste like plain boiled chicken with no seasonings or pepper. My husband had the shredded beef tacos and he also said it taste like they do not use any seasoning and just cook a plain piece of meat. The only thing we enjoyed were the strawberry and prickly pear margarita. If you are used to homemade Mexican food I highly recommend not wasting your time coming here."}
{"text":"The food is poor quality. The guacamole tastes like it was bought from Costco. The rice is bland and the beans taste like they're from a can. The service was great."}
{"text":"The red chili burrito is good, the salsa spicy & yes the beer is cold. The chips were on the ok side but lets face it unless they're card board they are just the salsa carrier. So only ok chips are so not a deal breaker for me. We went on a Saturday evening & the Karaoke was fun to hear for about 30 minutes. That is till the youngsters (25-40) comparatively speaking to the crooners (50+) took the stage. Then even the dogs in the yards took to howling thinking it was thier peeps a callin'. Not good so much so that we left Pueblo ealier then we wanted & headed down the street. Thanks Pueblo for a delicious burrito, spicy salsa & cold beers. Can't wait to go back & try the tacos then high tail it before younger Karaokes hit the mic."}
{"text":"The place it's so nice,but the food it's not what I spect....Poor,I do not like it..."}
{"text":"Best chips and salsa in the area. Very popular for locals...gotta really look for this place but it's worth it. Good portions and good taste. Very consistent, every time we go. The staff is friendly and service is quick."}
{"text":"Carne Asada Super Nachos are pretty good but all in all this place is pretty lame.  It's a neat location and atmosphere after a ball game at the park but beyond the Nachos I haven't been too impressed after several times eating here."}
{"text":"Love love  love Old Pueblo!  We have been going there for years. The Sonoran enchiladas are my husband's favorite and I'm a chicken taco kinda girl. You can't beat their chips and salsa and house margarita!  We seem to be here multiple times a week."}
{"text":"Fantastic little bar/pub with great atmosphere and great service.  Great complimentary home made chips with pico and hot sauce.  Really good Mexican food at a great value.  Lovely place.  Live music on weekends and Pacifico on tap!! Love this place! Outside patio is great!"}
{"text":"Good food! I love the bottles of salsa they give when you sit down, and sitting outside on a nice day is great."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my hang outs, the staff was friendly the location is great, especially in the spring where you can hang out in the patio.  On to the food... What happened?  I ordered my quesadilla with oaxacan cheese and chili.  It never came but hey did bring me my burrito, a bean and cheese and they messed that up!  My wife ordered their tilapia which might I add was always a winner and it was over cooked and dry!"}
{"text":"Standard Mexican-American fare. Food was good, not great. All the staff were very friendly and attentive. Beef taco and Chile relleno were good, enchiladas only so so, but the carne asada burrito was very tasty. Four stars instead of three because our waitress was amazing."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times and both have been good experiences.  I just haven't found the \"perfect\" food that I love to eat but what I have ordered has been decent.  This most recent occasion I got the tamale dinner and had one meat and one corn.  The tamale's were a decent size and it also came with a generous portion of rice and beans.  It was good but I wasn't dazzled.

I will say though, their tortilla chip is delicious.  It's soo flavorful, even without putting any salsa or other dip.  I joked with my friend they must fry the chips in some sort of super lardy oil or something.  We pondered and decided to not ponder any further.  Ignorance is bliss.

The service is good.  I just haven't found that one dish I love and have to have but I like it enough to come here again."}
{"text":"Split a dinner to save money with a friend, and while it saved us money, the meal was just so-so.  Chips were great tasting but salsa choices were either very hit or very bland (strong onion taste).  We combined the two for a slightly better taste.

Ordered the taco/enchilada combo, tacos were bland, no real flavor and enchiladas were descent but also bland.  

Service was good, waitress checked in on us often, however never asked us about dessert.  Probably would not come back."}
{"text":"Goat cheese quesadilla is melt in your mouth good.  And half order of nachos is almost too much.  Happy happy"}
{"text":"We had such a great time here tonight. GREAT FOOD, staff and the band was AMAZING!!! See you again soon!!!"}
{"text":"Holy Chile Relleno! Found this hidden gem thanks to you wonderful yelpers. Food was off the chain. Everything we ate was fantastic. The margaritas were a bit disappointment but the food was so amazing that we will go back and give it another try (perhaps several).  Everything was fresh and we cant wait to return."}
{"text":"This is honestly one of the worst restaurants, period! Service is terrible, two hours to be served. When the meal came it was wrong, not at all what I ordered, the server smiled and just shrugged before leaving, after I brought this to his attention! 
The food was cold, watery, and tasted terrible. I ate four or five bites and was done! 
It almost takes effort to screw up Mexican food! I will never eat at this place again, and have made it a point to tell anyone that will listen, not to eat here..."}
{"text":"The green chile quesadilla earned 5 stars on its own! BEST I have ever had. Lots of roasted fresh (not canned) chilis.   Taco salad was delish, so we're fish tacos and rice was really tasty. Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent and maybe we should come here more often.  The Husband and I have been here twice for food and drinks.  Their margaritas are pretty tasty and the chips and salsa are really good.  I don't remember what I ordered for an entree, but the next time I go back, I will update my review.  The servers were really nice and friendly too.  I like the fact that there's plenty of outdoor seating because who doesn't love sipping margaritas when the suns shining and the breeze is nice :)  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant in the center of Wigwam. There are seats outside where people can enjoy the view as well as the inside. The staff was friendly and fast, the food was not that great. We stopped by for an early lunch Sunday and split the quesadilla appetizer w/ carne asada. The peppers and onions were still raw and crunchy and the cheese was half melted and half not. The beef was really gummy and did not have very much seasoning. This was our first time here and was very disappointed. The hot sauce that came in the bottle wasn't bad, but the other mild salsa that they offer did lack seasoning. Maybe we'll try it again some other time, but sorry to say that we were not impressed by the food."}
{"text":"Never miss a chance to have a meal at Old Pueblo when I'm visiting the West Valley. Great alternative to the chains! Friendly, fun atmosphere and always delicious! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service & food sucked. Walked in with a group of 13 people and was told by the bus boy to seat ourselves. After literally 10 minutes, we were finally able to sit down after my family members rearranged different tables around to accommodate. Not once during this whole time did the servers offer to help; instead, they walked around us pretending to be busy (the restaurant was almost completely empty). I made the mistake of ordering fish tacos in Arizona... The tilapia was disgustingly FISHY and no amount of squeezed lemon was able to save it. I also had to ask for more corn tortillas from the kitchen because the original ones that came wrapped around it were completely soaked through from the rice and beans (to the point where I couldn't even pick them up--they all fell apart). Margaritas were ok, as were the salsa, chips & quesadilla that we had as apps. Came here last year (when we again stayed at the Wig Wam Resort across the street) and forgot about how less than mediocre this place was.  If it wasn't for my FIL not wanting to drive, we definitely wouldn't come back here. Now we know. Blegh."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and wanted some Mexican food. So we went here and the food was delicious the steak was nice and not fatty the fish tacos were good also. My wife got the shredded taco and they were good also. The salsa was awesome and endless. Next time in town I will stop in here. The only knock I have is I wish they put more onion and cilantro on the tacos. But I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"The second time I went here, it was absolutely horrible.  I ordered a vegetarian dish.  It came out stone cold.  I sent it back and it came out a second time, covered in cheese and when I dug in, I found meat.  They didn't even care!  I sent a letter to the owners and NEVER got a response.  This place is a disgusting excuse for a restaurant.  BEWARE!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! Adjacent to the Wigwam resort. Super convenient, walked about 50 paces out of our room and was there at restaurant. My Son, who's a bean aficionado loved the beans and salsa. I had the Carne Asada burrito and was very satisfied. My only regret was we didn't discover this place till the last day of our vacation."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot in Old Litchfield. The food is not particularly flavorful, but in a way that can be solved with a bit of hot sauce (or their tasty spicy salsa)."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Wigwam and wanted to grab some dinner.  I found this via yelp and thought why not- since it was right across the street.  

We were seated right away and sat outside.  The salsa and chips were probably the best part of the meal.  We also ordered some guac, but it was just ok (didn't really have a punch of flavor i was hoping for).  I had the spinach enchilladas and they were just ok too.  I wasn't really impressed with my entree and was hoping to have a bit more flavor.  Either way, its a good place to get a quick bite if you're in the area, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Service was good, salsa was good, chips were cold and stale. Enchiladas were hard and couldn't cut with my fork, had to muscle it with a knife. Mexican pizza, gross. Meat, bell peppers and onion with tomatoes thrown on a cheese crisp. Food had no flavor. The place was clean, sitting outside was nice. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Our food came lukewarm. Inattentive service. Food was very bland as well. Hot sauce wasn't that spicy, which is bad for a Mexican place. Bathrooms weren't functioning properly"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! One of the best Mexican restaurants I've eaten at, so far. Best salsa ever! The cheese enchiladas are REALLY good, too. My husband gets the chicken tacos, and those are kind of pricey. $4 per taco. So $12 for 3 tacos... I mean really? No beans and rice or anything. But anyway, the food is really good and the servers are always really nice. Yum!"}
{"text":"It's typical greasy, cheesy Mexican American food, nothing great. The service is usually slow but the patio is great and they have live music on the weekends. The owner doesn't seem to take much pride in the place and seems content with just getting by. There are roaches in the summer."}
{"text":"Over the last year or two I've given them several chances since there's a lot to like about this place.  The Pub area is nice, they have a great outside seating area, they have a great location, and they have chips and salsa at the bar, that's awesome. But would really gives them a poor review is the bar staff, not all of them, but I'm not going to keep track of who's working and when.  Sitting at the bar or in the pub as servers pass you by before you even order the first round then sitting with empty glasses or waiting forever to order dinner, even had someone forget to return my debit card.  I wanted to like this place but I got burned a few too many times."}
{"text":"by far the best green Chile enchiladas ever. the flavor was great. I am addicted to to their Chips and Salsa!!!"}
{"text":"Thumbs up on the fish tacos, carne asada, and Guacamole. Margaritas are run of the mill. Friday had music as well, which makes it thoroughly entertaining as well!"}
{"text":"Food was outstanding!  Drinks were good, service was prompt, but not really friendly. Can't wait to go back. The carne Asada burrito and the spinach enchiladas were wonderful."}
{"text":"I love this place. We come here nearly every weekend and the service in the bar is superb. Julie is a great bartender and knows our drink order by heart now. My husband loves the Sonoran enchiladas and I always get the carne asada street tacos. The food is great and the service and atmosphere is excellent. Come on a Saturday night around 9 for some AWFUL karaoke!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great, although one of our orders was incorrect. The chips and salsa was really good. I wasn't too big of a fan of the red sauce on the enchiladas. Beans were decent. 3/5 stars."}
{"text":"Thursday night around 9pm.

If you show your customers how messy you are I don't want to know what goes on where I can't see. 


As I walked in through the doors I couldn't help to notice we were the only ones in the restaurant. Two ladies sat on the corner having a conversation. Me and my girl stood at the door way trying to figure out if we self seat or wait. Finally one of the ladies in a loud voice says \"this side of the restaurant closed early however if you go across the way towards the bar side they can take your order\".

I walked through another set of doors and take a seat. I take a look around my surroundings only to realize their are  a number of tables scattered across the room with partial food on their plates, dirty empty glasses. You can clearly see they had been their for a while all the meanwhile I observe 3 workers having a good time near the bar. I counted less than 10 customers.


I walked out."}
{"text":"Happen to come across this little restaurant while staying at the wigwam, the food was awesome only to be outdone by Michelle our waitress we cannot say enough about her prompt friendly service to helping us decide what to eat, great job Michelle. I also want to give kudos to the guy who brought out the chips and salsa great job....."}
{"text":"A ok for sure!! Pretty decent Mexican food in a cutesy little area. The lunch combos were a bit high for this type of joint, around $9. 

The chips and salsa were great and service rwas friendly but slow. 

Good solid choice if you're out and about over here"}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to stop by here since it's so close to Luke AFB where we are stationed and was told their food was pretty good. We showed up at the time it opened and was greeted by a nice waitor right away, he was nice and friendly, also brought us chips and two kinds of salsa, one was like a picadillo which was very tasty. I ordered a combination plate that had a chicken crispy taco, cheese enchilada with green saue, chile relieno, rice & beans and oh my it was good. I was very pleased and so was my friend who had a chicken quesadilla and taco. I love where its located within a cute neighborhood and how its family owned. I will recommend this place to everybody."}
{"text":"The food here is worse than chain Mexican and the service is forgetful as best, inattentive at worst. 

We were served old, dried out and tasteless  pico along with crumbly chips, followed by old and dry corn tortillas with no moisture of any kind on the fish tacos. No hot sauce available other than tabasco. 

This is, unfortunately, my third time here and it is always this way. I only keep coming here because it's the closest place off-site from the Wigwam Resort, which is where I have to come for work. 

Even the sushi place next door is better. Think about that for a moment...a sushi place in AZ is better than this Mexican joint."}
{"text":"I love when you walk into a place and they have like 5 tables inside and like 20 outside.  It's a true sign of a successful mom and pop place to me.  

So... had our party of six outside... it was nice, green grass around, and it was cool at the time.

The server was pleasant and she goofed off with us... there was one time she took forever to get my beer and she comped it for me, without me even complaining about anything.

The chile relleno was really good, and I was hugely surprised at how good the beans and rice were.  

Hubby had the carnitas and being a mexican himself, he's pretty critical of any mexican food and he loved the carnitas."}
{"text":"OK, I am spoiled. I have had really great Mexican food being from Southern CO, living in SOCAL and working in Albuquerque, so... The Old Pueblo Cafe is \"OK\" Mexican food. But this is a biased opinion. I think in the west valley it is probably one of the best \"sit down\" places. 

The food is usually pretty good, prices are very reasonable and the homemade salsa is GREAT. The atmosphere is what really makes it a spot I go back to often. The staff is always friendly, fast and accommodating. Plus, in a West Valley World of Chains and bland taste buds, this locally owned, unique restaurant set on a quiet, neat little street is a breath of fresh air!"}
{"text":"This is a good little hole in the wall place! We came due to the reviews however we were surprised the food was really good. We are Texans and are use to Tex-mex! The queso is very good, the waiter always made sure our drinks were full and the food was over all good."}
{"text":"This place is so cute, hole in the wall great food!!!! Always good and always great service"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and atmosphere, especially when they have live music.  Their green chili is the best (I get it in a burrito). Service is decent most times, we have one waitress that is always so kind and remembers us when we go."}
{"text":"Wow all the other Yelpers were right on with this one.  The chips and salsa are amazing.  The atmosphere is very cool with the outside misters and big screen TV's to watch the game.  However the food was so-so.  If I were to go back it would be great for appetizers and beer to watch a game."}
{"text":"Service was great, but the food quality is just ehh.. the food is a bit tasteless. I Would rather go to Manuels in Avondale. The outside patio is nice though. The prickly pear margarita was a great deal too, but the food could be a lot better. 2 stars for the good service, and free chips and pico."}
{"text":"Located in downtown Litchfield Park across from the wigwam resort. Very large outdoor patio and also includes indoor dining and a bar area. 

Chips and salsa are amazing. Highly recommend their folded tacos, best crispy taco on the Westside."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here 2 or 3 times and each time it's been great!  We found it on accident, and oh what a fortunate accident!  Their homemade salsa is fantastic, very garlicky which I love!  The pico de gallo is fantastic.  Bananas Ranas needs to take a note from this place (they serve Pace, wtf?)

We're working our way through the menu.  We took a visiting friend to this restaurant with us last time and he was very glad we did, loved dinner!"}
{"text":"Guacamole needs help! Fish tacos were good. Taco salad was good too. They need to keep doors closed to keep flies out!!!"}
{"text":"Salsa, pico and chips were very good! The rest of our food was good but didn't blow me away"}
{"text":"Service was absolutely horrible.  Our appetizers came out after our meals even though we kept asking for them.  A Margarita was brought out after 3 times asking for it and it was all melted.  The food wasn't hot.  This is a poor excuse for a restuarant.  The guacamole was tasteless.  Everything was bad all around.  ychhh"}
{"text":"We really liked this place and we are picky about our Mexican food. The food was fresh and tasty. Salsa was great."}
{"text":"Love the margaritas and Old Pueblo nachos appetizer on a hot summers day. That really hits the spot.  Also love the deserts excellent sopapillas. Not so big on the combo lunches, seems non-authentic. Nevertheless, good food if your are in litchfield park."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Usually Mexican restaurants seem the same to me but I loved the chips & hot salsa they gave us. Overall I was really pleased with the food and the service."}
{"text":"Super good, well portioned. I got the folded tacos and they were busting with meat. They didn't short-change us on filling at all. Quiet and convenient for us while staying at the Wigwam Resort. Friendly service."}
{"text":"The Old Pueblo Cafe does not reside in Tucson. However, it does a very good job of reminding me of home and the amazing Mexican food options available there. This restaurant represents another win for the west valley.

The rustic atmosphere here reminds me of places further south. This is an honest to goodness Adobe structure with some red brick walls as well. The rusted corrugated tin ceiling panels are awesome!

It's been a while since my first visit to Old Pueblo Cafe. Once again, my girlfriend suggested this destination. She may not Yelp!, but she gets a lot of the credit for the places we visit. And this dinner was wonderful! Not to mention the great service by our waitress Jelly. Yes. Ask for \"Jelly\".

The chips and salsa are some of the best I've had in a while. You get a big bowl of pico de gallo and a separate dish of their hot sauce. Plus the light, crispy chips are just salty enough.

I chose the Mexican Flag, an entree with three enchiladas featuring chicken, spinach and pork fillings with a variety of red and green sauces. Very satisfying! My girlfriend enjoyed her Carne Asada Street Tacos. I got a sample and the seasoning was amazing enough to make me jealous. Not only is the food delicious, but it's an outstanding value!

Old Pueblo Cafe is located on a very competitive block in terms of dining options. It's clear why they have survived over the years. And even better, they are a lot closer than Tucson!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable Mexican joint here in little old litchfield Park.  Love the patio and the music.  Food good!  Had a pleasant experience and will return."}
{"text":"A lot has changed. Karaoke with Kyle is always awesome and the crowds are pleasant. Bartenders know their drinks and also know how to handle the crowd. Great food, great drinks and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of my high school friends took me here once with her family. It is hidden in old litchfield area and it is a pretty decent mexican food place. I loved their beans and rice. OO Don't forget their complimentary chips and salsa. Their pico was amazing! I actually got it togo a couple times when I was eating there."}
{"text":"Nice Relaxing place to grab a bite to eat.

 I have been to the Old Pueblo Cafe on several occasions and have always enjoyed the food. Today my lunch comoanion and I ordered tamales and Mexican Flag enchiladas (1 chicken, 1 beef & 1 spinach,) with a side of rice & beans. The servings were  huge and tasty, we even took home some leftovers.

While waiting for our entrées, we sampled a basket of near perfect tortilla chips.  The chips were thin, crisp and lightly salted. The house made fresh pico de gallo salsa was a wonderful compliment, especially mixed with the hot sauce which is served separately.

The food is good, servings are generous, and the price is affordable.  The staff is always friendly, polite, and accomdating.  I would recommend you try Old Pueblo Cafe if you are in the area.   It's a nice relaxing place to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Living in Avondale I was excited to check out this place due to the rave reviews.  I ordered the machaca chimi.  Delish!  The chips and pico are wonderful.  The other salsa is a runny, roasted chipotle (adobo) sauce - good and not too spicy.  I am a refried beans lover and I was unimpressed by the beans.  I'm old school and love REAL refried beans with lard - sorry, I just do.  These beans were clearly mashed with either cheese or milk....They tasted like they were from a can.  Mexican rice was very good.  Only 3 stars from me - food was decent but there are better alternatives."}
{"text":"This place was just ok.  Decided to stop in here with a friend before an event we were attending at the Wigwam, the sidewalk seating is quaint and inviting.  Plus they have misters, an absolute necessity this time of year in AZ.  

When we stepped up to the reception desk inside, we were told to sit anywhere we liked, so we grabbed a spot outside.  The server greeted us quickly and took our drink order.  It was a little weird (and disappointing) that the Happy Hour specials were only available if they were ordered at the bar, so we had to settle for full price drinks.  And then I was told they didn't have ginger ale for my first choice mixer, so I had to rethink my order.  Not too big a deal, just slightly off-putting.  

As a vegan, I was maybe relying too heavily on a few of the prior reviewers' assertions that the chips and salsa were great (I was anticipating that might likely be the only thing I could eat here).  They were okay, not anything to write home about.  There weren't any appealing vegan options to speak of, wasn't able to order a side of black beans (they only serve refried beans), so I just stuck to my chips and salsa and Long Island.  My friend's meal looked appetizing enough, but she didn't rave about it being outstanding or anything.

I would give this place another try if I were in the area, just for convenience sake, and because the Old Litchfield is kind of cute and quaint, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have a meal at this cafe.  It was just alright."}
{"text":"Great food & fun atmosphere!
It is one of those low-key place you look for when trying to find something unique. I have had fun everytime I've been there. Plus its a great place to learn a little about the history of Litchfield Park and how far it has come. Its a perfect dinner venue on the 4th of July for the fireworks displays from Goodyear & Litchfield Park.
mmmmm, ready for lunch right now, right now!!!"}
{"text":"Steer clear from their fish tacos! They were absolutely horrible!  The side of rice and beans were tasteless! Chips and salsa were good and that was it!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  It has awesome outdoor seating and the food is great!  Love the veggie quesadilla and the chicken tacos.  Their chips and salsa is addicting.  They have a great pickley pear margarita. The downfall can be the service.  Some times it's great other times it takes forever to get the bill to leave."}
{"text":"Great chips and salsa. And that's as much as I can rate. Seeing as we didn't get to order our drinks for a ridiculously long time. Then the sever never came to get our dinner order. So we paid and left. The chips and salsa is enough to make me give this place another shot but need to make sure there's no game or private party or anything that will make them busy and incapable of serving any other guests."}
{"text":"After choosing our table and having it cleaned, the same young waitress returned with chips, salsa and menus. I asked the waitress for a Coke to which she replied \"I'm not your server\". After waiting a little while our designated server appeared and took our order. Our designated server delivered our first round of drinks and our food. The rest of the time we were constantly asked by the first waitress if we needed anything, including refilling our drinks. I think we were in a server parallel universe.
BTW - the food was okay.
Beware of the umbrellas at the tables. They have seen better days. After almost being beaned by one I spent the rest of the meal holding on to it so it wouldn't fall on me again."}
{"text":"Was told they have the best chips & salsa in town.....THEY DO!!  Salsa in a squeeze bottle and chips are fresh made!  

Cheese enchiladas were delicious the staff was GREAT and the evening outside seating was perfect!  Go there now!!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand why all the great reviews about this place. Maybe it's because of it's location (being one of the few restaurants in Litchfield Park) or maybe it's the alcohol. Either way, it's not that good. Being new to Arizona, we decided that on our anniversary we would try 2 new restaurants. The Old Pueblo Cafe was our dinner choice. Poor choice to end a great day on this note. We had a trio of tacos (1 beef, 1 chicken & 1 fish) and a green chile beef chimichanga. The chimi was mediocre. The tacos were all bad. The fish taco actually made us sick. All 3 were hard from being old tortillias. Absolutely this has been the second worst Mexican food we have ever eaten. Also, the food is really overpriced for the quality and quantity. We won't be back and recommend that you don't waste your time, money or calories either."}
{"text":"We live nearby and must say great food and staff. Meals are affordable and delicious. It's a great place to just sit and have a drink and have chips and salsa."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch while visiting friends over the weekend.  I've been here many times years ago when I lived in Goodyear Az and always had a good experience but this time was only mediocre.

The art and food festival was going on down old litchfield road which brought out a ton of people.  Surprisingly, there was an open table on the patio though and we didn't have to wait at all.  The place was very crowded though and it took almost an hour and a half to get our food after we ordered.  I got the enchiladas suizas which are usually very good but this time mine were only luke warm at best.  No one else at the table complained.  The chips and salsa were good as well, they bring out two types (a spicy one and a milder chunky one).

Overall, this is a decent mexican restaurant (probably the best one in Goodyear).  They have good food and it is in a nice scenic part of town tucked away in old litchfield park.  They also have a full bar but I think their margaritas are a little too sweet."}
{"text":"Food was good, unfortunately, many in my party was not feeling good the next day.  Not accusing this place of food poisoning, but it did have a negative affect on most of us that ate there."}
{"text":"Their nachos are really good, and a large amount as well. I will definitely go back again!!"}
{"text":"So we have been looking to try out a new place in Old Town Litchfield and this was our choice today. 

Overall the experience was good.  Server was attentive, friendly and timely.  He seemed to be working the patio area with another lady and was doing a great job.  Zero complaints about the service.  Also had a good selection o  the menu.  Prices were a tad higher than the norm, but nothing outrageous.  Total tab was $34 for both of us.

Everyone is super pumped about their salsa.  It was decent.  Nothing to write home about but nothing horrible either.  If you like good salsa, you won't be impressed.  It's endless chips and Salsa which is always good.

I ordered the pork tamales and my girl ordered the Barbacoa plate.  Tamales were decent.  Again, not earth shattering and not bad.  Rice was good.  Beans lacked a little.  Everything was drenched in cheese which was a bit much.  My girls barbacoa was very salty.  Couldn't even finish it.

We ordered Sopapillas.   Not bad, you can tell they were frozen though, not freshly made.

Overall the food was OK and the service was really good.   Nice little spot but not good enough for a return visit."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant. Chips and pica are great. Green chili strips cheese crisp yummy. Margaritas are a must here. Will be back"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great Mexican restaurant and bar this is it! Great food, friendly service and wonderful atmosphere! Come check it out in beautiful Old Litchfield Park!"}
{"text":"LOOOVE this place, Always friendly, Food is great!! and the BEST NACHOS EVER!!!!! I grew up in Litchfield park and we were excited when they opened up here! Great margaritas and it the first place my brothers ask to go when they come in town to visit!!!"}
{"text":"To be fair, i will start this review off by saying i have eaten here once or twice in the past and it was \"better\" than my last experience. But my last experience will be just that...my last.

My boyfriend and i sat outside, which is a very small area, right on the sidewalk. The misters are a nice touch, but don't really reach you. I am a strict vegetarian (vegan actually) so ordered off the a la carte menu and ordered \"vegetable tacos\" and \"potato tacos\"...one would assume something called a \"vegetable taco\" would be vegetarian, but just to make sure, i asked our waitress. She said very confidently that there was no meat in them. I requested no cheese on them even. When the dishes came out, my boyfriend asked me what was in the tacos, so i started to push the food around with my fork to get a better look and it's a darn good thing i did, because all of a sudden i saw big chunks of fish. GROSS! I nearly lost my appetite. We explained to the waitress the problem and she didn't have the apologetic reaction i would have expected. She was less than sympathetic but took my plate back and got me new tacos. Once we began eating though, our table slowly became infested with flies. They were all over the chips and salsa, all over the glasses of water, all over US...it got so bad that i couldn't even eat anymore. It was disgusting.  We spent our entire meal swatting flies and pushing them off ourselves and our food. Add to that, an employee from the restaurant next door literally walking over to in front of right where we sitting to beat out a filthy dusty carpet, with plumes of dust going everywhere. I had had it. Truly awful experience and will not be back!"}
{"text":"Great mexican food,wide selection of beers and cocktails,complimentary chips and salsa,very friendly staff..never disappointed,I usually have the chicken enchiladas or carne tacos,highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place! That says a lot, being a native Litchfield Parkian, I'm pretty nostalgic/upset/happy/thrilled/worried about whatever business may go into the strip center there (is it still called Tierra Verde Village?) Anyway, Old Pueblo has definitely been embraced by the community and those of us wayward natives who have left the area. 
Fine Mexican food. Only one time was I disappointed with what I ordered. They have a full bar and karaoke, outdoor and indoor seating. It's a lovely place - lovely. Peter has done a great job on this place. Just love it."}
{"text":"This place is a great local spot where you can see a lot of the same faces.  I wouldn't recommend the food as much as the atmosphere and drinks.  I have eaten here several times and it's just okay.  If you sit on the bar side it's obvious sometimes that your food sits for a while before you get it because they have to run to the main restaurant to get it.  

If you stay a while on the bar side plan on walking to the bar to get your drinks especially if it's busy.  The table service in the bar is lacking, unless the bartender named Julie is working and she is great.  I have seen other bartenders stand around and BS with the regulars while people at my table and I have empty drinks.  

They have live music sometimes which is great.  Several TV'S and they are great about having sports on.  The beers on tap are pretty basic with some strange ones taking up tap space like Moosehead and Pacifico.  The complimentary chips and salsa are great .  It's a little pricy compared to other sports bars but I have to consider the location.  

I will be back, maybe just won't eat."}
{"text":"This is a mediocre Mexican place the beans are the best part. Everything else was just ok"}
{"text":"We drive all the way to litchfeild from Old Town Scottsdale because the food is to die for! Tonight we had the Sonoran enchiladas, carnitas enchilada green burro and shredded beef burro. All were a 10/10!! I can't wait to bring my out of town family here! Service was wonderful as well and the patio is dog friendly!! Five stars, all day long!!!!"}
{"text":"Love it here!!!! Pet friendly, great outdoor space, AMA-A-ZING service!!! Best Mexican food in Litchfield Park by far!!!  Great for special occasions, family friendly, great bar area, locally owned!!!  Best place in the west valley!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Sonoran Green Enchiladas. They were hearty and delicious! I will definitely be coming back to this place. They do serve big plates. So go on a hungry stomach. I could not finish my whole plate."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the atmosphere. Very laid back. Food was good! Portions perfect. Great for brunch, lunch. Outside seating area is great, when it's not too hot. Looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"The food was great. And big enough portions that left us just famished. The only complaint I would have is the server was not as attentive as we had hoped it would be. But the food was worth making another come back soon. The ambience was cute and perfect for a small get together."}
{"text":"Chips poco and  green salsa with beef. Open air and AC inside. Drink good

This is right across the street from The Wigwam.  the food was good, you got a lot of it, and the cost was very reasonable.  I got Chips poco and green salsa with beef.  They were not too spicy.  The marguerite was excellent.

Considering they were hosting a large bridal party, they were very attentive to a single diner.  I got everything I needed or requested very promptly..  Definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"Overpriced Mexican food that is below average. What a let down for a place located right next to the Wigwam resort. The owner is clearly not looking at his quality of food as it has gotten worse over the years. I live half a mile from here and have eaten here the past 10 years and have seen this place get worse. I'm surprised people still give their money to this establishment. The only thing worth getting is the salsa, I'll give them that."}
{"text":"Been here several times and the food is never good. Chicken is always super dry, and most things do not have any flavor, except for the chips and salsa, which are the only good things here...that and the outdoor patio. My suggestion would be to come here for drinks and chips and head to litchfields across the street for some yummy dishes."}
{"text":"Old Pueblo Cafe is a cute little Mexican eatery tucked away in Litchfield Park.  I've been here a handful of times in the last couple of years and always leaving feeling alright (or a-ok in Yelpland) about my experience.

Like many other reviewers have mentioned, the fresh salsa and chips are a delight.  I love places that make really amazing pico de gallo and then also give you a fabulous tube (or ketchup bottle) of much hotter salsa to make your own perfectly spicy concoction.  I know- it is the small things in life.

When I was here on Wednesday, I ordered the spinach enchiladas with green sauce.  Not mind blowing, but decent.  The rice was great and being able to add the salsa to the mix also helped.  

Service is always pretty consistent, and they do have a happy hour (one dollar off of everything).  Margaritas seem to be hit or miss- I've had some great ones and some not so fabulous ones.  They have pitchers available of both margaritas and a couple of beers.

If you are staying at the Wigwam Resort, I'd recommend this place if you were really craving Mexican but I wouldn't go out of my way to check it out OR I'd suggest trying one of the other eateries on this little street of fun."}
{"text":"It was alright, nothing really to write about. Food was soggy. Pretty disappointed. My husband called in our order and it still took forever to get.  The food came and everything was soggy.  Had a decent flavor but wasn't anything fantastic.  I definitely wouldn't eat here again"}
{"text":"Well, first time visit and they get a 5 star before I even get my food. Fresh beer and the MOST AWESOME poco salsa. Yummm great locale sitting outside with the misters."}
{"text":"(3.5 stars really) We are regulars here. It is not the absolute best but it's the best nearby. The chips and salsa are yummy and we can't stop eating them! We like the chicken burros, green chile and enchiladas. The soup has been disappointing and the service is a bit slow. Still the prices are reasonable and the atmosphere (particularly the patio or sports bar) is inviting."}
{"text":"Poor service is extreme liability which is too bad since the food appears delicious. Host told us waiting he did not know who was next so he was just going to start seating people. Luckily, everyone used the honor system. Please put salt on the tables. Maybe they don't bring water because we're in a desert (I'm from tacoma) but my mouth is on fire from hot sauce and I have nothing to drink!"}
{"text":"I'm giving Old Pueblo 5 stars because the food is DELICIOUS and priced right! I relocated to the West Valley (aka food desert) last year from Austin. Let's just say that my husband and I had struck out time and time again until we landed at Old Pueblo for Sonoran Mexican food.

The chips and salsa were fresh, the beer was cold, and the green chili beef nachos exceeded expectations! The savory carne asada tacos were served on the perfect corn tortillas con frijoles y arroz-- also notable! 

Our only side comment is... The chairs could be more comfortable! But then again.. We've yet to try out the killer patio! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Oh how I love amazing Mexican food. The highlight here though was the salsa! It was true authentic salsa rojo los of chilis and lots of great spice. It was so hot but I couldn't stop eating it. It came in a squirt bottle so you can put it on everything it was that good. 

We had a group of 15 people here for a Leadership dinner and we were seated right away, we sat outside and the wait staff was very attentive. They didn't forget about us outside! Seemed pretty jammed packed inside too. It was nice to grab dinner while the sun was going down in perfect temperature.

I got a crispy burrito and it was HUGE! I should've known they do it big in Arizona. I wish they had salsa like this back home in WA. They sell salsa too! The marg was a little too sweet for my taste but they use top shelf patron in most drinks. 

The resort I stayed at is in walking distance to this place and I swear there were moments late at night when I was craving that salsa rojo! When I come back to Litchfield, I will be coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"It's hit and miss with their service.  I'm not sure what is going on with this place, every time we go back it seems to be getting worse. Seems like the owner only hires teenagers who don't care or want to be there. Sad to see this place start to go under and loose customers.."}
{"text":"Loved the location of the restaurant. It was a little hectic and confusing trying to figure out how to get a seat or even where the bar part of the restarant was. Be wary if seated outside as bugs may actively fly near you as do the birds if trash left by other customers is not picked up soon enough. Otherwise, service was friendly and I would deff reconmend this place for families. The chips and salsa were delicious, as were the margaritas. From what I experienced the food was not spicy at all, but still good. It seemed a little pricey for what you ordered but still nice"}
{"text":"When visiting my family in Litchfield park I have to stop by Old Pueblo for their chips and salsa. The rest of their menu in a blur but that salsa will haunt me  forever. Great stuff. The carne asada was pretty good but too full on the chips and salsa to enjoy. I don't think you will regret going here."}
{"text":"We were there again this weekend. Same fabulous food! Same great price! And the service was ridiculously fast. LOVE this place!!!"}
{"text":"Staying next door at the Wig wam resort and walked over to the corner restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised. To start, the chips and salsa were delicious. They give give 2 different salsas to choose from and both were great. We ordered the grilled Salmon special and it was cooked to perfection. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars. Decent Mexican food. I could tell because there was some still on my menu!

Full bar. One decent margarita. One type of Chardonnay for my wife. Nothing special about the place at all, just basic good food. Service was nice and efficient. Plenty of seating and they were busy tonight. (Thursday)"}
{"text":"We were here for a wedding reception and dined outside. The wedding also had a band which seemed to be enjoyed by restaurant patrons, too. The service was incredible and we enjoyed their buffet of tacos, bean burritos, cheese enchiladas, rice and beans. Their chips and salsa were very good, too!"}
{"text":"Great local place. I ordered the number two. It was very good. The Chile Relleno is a little unique but was tasty. The patio is fantastic."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of Old Pueblo Cafe makes you feel like you are crowded into a \"old Pueblo\" which some may like but I felt was a little cramped. The food in my opinion was catered to the nice next door hotel and not towards those seeking truly authentic Mexican food. The price point is a bit high though the service is exceptionable. The salsa is great like the other reviews said but I honestly don't know if that was enough to earn repeat business. The combo plates are good but the rice and beans need some life, because they seem to be stuck in dryville. I think more tex-mex style consumers would enjoy this place to it's fullest so I'll rate it A-ok for them."}
{"text":"We visited this location to support a fundraiser. We appreciated that they took part in the fundraiser but the food was boring and the service was slow and totally bored out of their mind too. The outside table next to us actually had a chair break while they were dining, I felt so bad. I am not sure if anyone even helped them out. Nothing special but I do appreciate the help they gave fundraising."}
{"text":"Just had the best salmon tacos ever!! 
It's taco Tuesday here at the Old Pueblo and the salmon tacos had a great mango salsa on top and the corn tortillas were just perfect. This meal was accompanied with a Mexican iceberg which is also very refreshing on a hot afternoon. They also have the best salsa and pico de gallo on Old Litchfield Road"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years and this is the first time I have wanted to complain. Our server only came to our table twice, the other server had to bring us chips, our drinks were empty for the majority of our meals. When we were finished eating we sat for 20 minutes before she returned to give us our checks then another 15 before she returned to collect. She only had 2 tables. And treated the other table the same. I absolutely love the food here never have complaints about that ever but the service has really gone down."}
{"text":"We tried Old Pueblo out for lunch, the food was good and well prepared.  The waiter was excellent and attended to our needs.... good food, good times"}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way back from Wildlife World Zoo after seeing they changed the restaurant there and it doesn't have very good reviews. This was a great alternative. Plenty of food and a nice variety. I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This place is adorable and great food.  The chicken was a bit dry, but the cheese enchiladas and beef tacos were excellent.  The carnitas were good too.  They have an outdoor seating area, which is great when the weather is nice.  There's not a lot of seating inside."}
{"text":"Loved it! 

We were staying at the Wigwam Resort and decided to try the Old Pueblo Cafe which is right across the street. There is a gate at the hotel that allows guests easy access to the restaurant.  Their outdoor seating is kept cool by a misting system. Everything was great - the food, the service and the live entertainment they had (weekends.)"}
{"text":"We used to love this place. Great drinks, salsa, and food. Last few times have been very disappointing.  Tonight, terrible service, very slow... Three different servers brought us stuff every 15 minutes. Food was dry an not flavorful. We had to wave down another server for our check, then wait another 15 minutes an finally took it to the bar to pay out. It's Friday night, hire some attentive staff. We won't be back. This great lil restaurant has gone down hill the last few years.  Not recommended, go down the street to Manny's, good food an great service!"}
{"text":"Outstanding salsa!  They bring the pico and salsa separate so you can mix your own to taste and they are generous with both... 

Green chili beef nachos.... Mmmmmmmm, so yummy!  So huge! 

Negro Modelo... Perfectly cold!

Next time we find ourselves at The Old Pueblo Cafe, this is what we will order and nothing more because this was the highlight... Downhill fast after our appetizers... 

Momma had Sonoran Enchiladas and thought they had no real flavor or heat... She tried adding some salsa but it did not help, they were just too bland to be helped.

The Main Man had Mexican Flag Enchiladas and found cold spots within the warmth... What the heck?  His refried beans had whole, hard, crunchy beans among what looked like old, crusty mush... What the heck?  Overall, he says his plate was bland as well.

I had a fish taco and relleno with rice and beans.  The tortilla for the taco arrived already saturated with moisture and falling apart... I discarded it and was left with my hunk of cod, cabbage, lettuce, and sauce... Still tasty but more of a salad than a taco.  The relleno gave me fond memories of La Union Station; if you've been you know what I'm talking about, if you have not... Sorry... My beans had appropriate consistency and I liked the rice just fine for the few bites I took.

The service was efficient and pleasant for an extremely busy Sunday afternoon during the big art event but when most of the main dishes are sub-par, I can't go higher than 2 stars... Stick with the salsa, nachos, and beer and have a 4-5 star experience!"}
{"text":"Another five star experience!   We had our same server, Michael, from the last time we visited.  And he made our experience perfectly wonderful yet again.  The nachos and burritos were amazing.  Great food.  Attentive and helpful server - oh, and the local beer Michael suggested was fabulous!   Thanks again for a lovely experience with yummy food."}
{"text":"This is a very busy place on Friday nights and they don't seem to be capable of making the proper adjustments to adequately serve large numbers of customers.

The service was generally slow and inattentive, though it did improve once they became aware of us.

There is also an unrealistic expectation that patrons will automatically know to seat themselves upon arrival.

I have nothing good to say about their food.  Their carne asada burrito was bland, watery, and unappetizing.  

Their chile relleno made me gag.  It was by far the worst.  The chile itself was hard and difficult to chew and I had to spit out the seeds.  The taste was disgusting.  I pushed it aside immediately after choking down the first bite.  

The chicken enchiladas were extremely dry and tasteless.  

I literally left half a plate full of food uneaten.  Our waitress kept asking if I needed a box, to which I repeatedly declined.

Their only saving grace is the chips and drinks.  My margarita was fine.  No complaints.

In sum, if you want to punish yourself and have a miserable experience, eat at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Not a great first impression to start. Took 16 minutes for someone to take our drink order. At least the drinks are a decent size. The lemonade is not \"real\" per se. Tastes like a liquid mix with sugar added. 

Not that it's gross, it's just odd. 

Chips are sparse and broken. 

No salt or pepper on the table. 

33 minutes from being seated, two of us, to being served. 

The flavor of the food is fine, nothing spectacular. The woman who finally came to check on us was quite friendly and nice. 

The smell of the fish tacos kicked me in the face but again, flavor was fine. 

I read a review that said they have great pico here. Perhaps those people were from Sweden?  The pico is basically chunky tomato broth. And yeah, flavor is okay, but it's white people pico. 

The \"spicy\" guacamole sauce is in-your-face lime with a spritz of jalapeño. 

The salad needs its lettuce chopped up as the pieces are far too large to easily eat, especially when buried under all that stuff. 



Chips are fresh. Beans and rice, no complaints. 

People do bring their dogs, so be aware of that. 

Outdoor atmosphere is good. So maybe come for the ambiance, the booze, and nights there's a band. Food? Not at all worth it."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place out and was bummed to leave disappointed. I had the spinach enchiladas and was happy until I hit the middle. They were cold and gummy which ruined the whole experience.


Food was a bit blah and service was incredibly slow."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Old Pueblo. It's perfect for sitting outside, people watching, enjoying the weather, and talking.  The drinks are good and the servers are friendly.  Some days, the food is slow coming out, but others it's fine. We have never minded, because there's no need to hurry out of there.  Order another drink, kick back, and enjoy the atmosphere in Old Town Litchfield Park."}
{"text":"The food is bland and just ranked \"okay\". The price is a little expensive for what you get. They have a pretty good selection of beers and mixed drinks. But nothing really special about this place. I may go back, but no time soon in the near future."}
{"text":"The food we ordered took a while and it was just ok. There weren't too many people dining and there seemed to be just one server. Maybe an off night? Plus ordered a Cadillac Margareta and the lady wasn't sure what it was.. What she brought was simple syrup and maybe a shot of tequila. Long story short we ordered single tacos and were charged for a meal with rice and beans, waters were left empty and waitress took over 15 mins to bring check. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The goat cheese quesadilla is amazing!  The nachos are the best ever! Love the atmosphere. History aficionados, be sure to check out the exposed Adobe wall!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for the obligatory Mexican fare on Cinco De Mayo.  They were very busy, but our wait for a table was only about ten minutes.  We sat inside and the interior while being clean looked disorganized, and there was a lack of any wall decorations or décor in general, just bare brick / adobe or paint.  

The chips and salsa were great.  There were two types of salsa, one was very spicy and had a pleasant smoky flavor, and the other was a nice fresh pico that was very mild and flavorful as well.  The menu featured traditional Mexican favorites including soup, wings and an extensive ala carte menu.

Each of us had the folded taco dinner and it was good.  Our waitress was pleasant and attentive, but we didn't see a lot of smiles from the staff, most everyone had a pretty serious look about themselves.  I would probably recommend sitting outside (if it isn't too hot) to escape the \"eating in a big box\" sort of feel.  The food was good, but I would like to say that something stood out more than the chips and salsa, but nothing did, this time.

Good value for the money for basic Mexican style food, in a nice neighborhood in the downtown section of historic Litchfield Park."}
{"text":"First time here and I must say this place was amazing! Might be my favorite mexican food place in town. It's a cozy small place inside but alot of outdoor seating. Service was great too! The plate I tired the barbacoa plate was really good! It's as close to authentic which is very rare to find in town. Though this was my first visit I was very impressed and I plan to come again soon to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"I hate to write this review in a negative way...However, I will start by saying the best Mexican restaurant around this area by far!  We love going here and I will continue to go during lunch or the day and site on the restaurant side.  We are pretty regular and on a Friday night I had 6 friends join me on the bar side and the blonde bartender behind the bar was the most rudest, snottiest, slowest waitress I have ever come across.  I know she has been there for sometime and MAYBE just maybe she was having a bad day BUT her attitude was off the charts and made our Friday night one to NEVER forget nor return on that side or on a Friday night!  I know how busy the Old Pueblo is every night and this message won't affect the business (not my intentions). I just wanted to point this out to anyone who has received this same behavior (unacceptable).  Enjoy the food!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local spot. I like their pico salsa & chips and the tacos and hot sauce always hit the spot.  The service has always consistenly good. It is owned by a local Litchfield Park resident and I'm always willing to support that."}
{"text":"Great place, great service, reasonable prices.  Will do this again!"}
{"text":"A cutsie little place near WigWam resort and spa. Nice staff, cleanish place. The salsa provided was two types. First, a chunky version of pico de gallo and second was a \"hot\" sauce like version. Chunky tomatoes seemed old in appearance and \"hot\" salsa tasted like modified store bought hot sauce with modification ingredient being chili powder. 

Ordered barbacoa which comes with one Lrg tortilla, rice and beans. The rice, beans and large tortilla we're great. The barbacoa tasted as though it had been marinated in salt water with accidental over spill of chili powder. 

My partner ordered carnitas which comes with a lrg tortilla, rice and beans. He ate it but said carnitas we're lacking flavor. I tried the dish and he was right. No real flavor you expect to come with carnitas. 

Shame really as this is in a great location. 
I won't be going back but if you like salty over dosed in chili powder(tasting) food then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Omgosh this place is great! I had an early dinner with a couple of friends for my birthday celebration around 4 o'clock on Saturday. I never knew that this place existed and they wanted to try it out. I had a strawberry Margarita and the 3 folded tacos plate. It was so good. Our waitress was really nice and attentive. I had a birthday flan to finish off the evening. We had such a fabulous dinner and by the time we walked out, the place was super busy. There is dining inside and a huge outside area in front of the restaurant. All of the meals were so tasty!!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"We expected great things and for the most part we weren't disappointed, I just expected more.  

Being from Montana, and in the Southwest on vacation, I thought after reading reviews I'd be in for something special.  What I got was typical Mexican fare and flare without being dazzled.

Don't get me wrong, it was still very good.  Just not special.

I will give them a nod for their home made hot sauce.  Very very spicy and very very delicious.

No ground beef.  Shredded only.

Small indoor dining room with rustic chairs tables.  Not very comfortable in the chair department but the Mexican theme is strong inside.

Outside is also nice when it's cooler.

Standouts to me were the the sauce mentioned earlier along with the cheese enchilada."}
{"text":"Better off getting a frozen Mexican dinner at the grocery store."}
{"text":"We were very surprised that this place was so good. It's hard to find good Mexican food even though there are plenty of options here in AZ. Rice particularly was very good and most every place the rice is very bland. I will say I do wish they had salsa with their chips as the appetizer, but their Pico was very fresh and good. We will definitely come back here and tell people of this place as it is very very good."}
{"text":"Horrible experience . On vacation from Washington state and drove 15 mins to sit down outside and have some chips and salsa and a drink and they declined our ID's saying they weren't excepted by the system. Never again will we try to spend a nice afternoon in the sun at this restraint ."}
{"text":"The pros: Great chips, chicken tacos, rice and beans.

The cons: everything else. Got a chicken burrito and the inside had a cream of chicken soup mixture in it. Not edible and not mexican food. Both salsas were not very good. The cheese enchilada did not have a good flavor, just really nothing to it. 

I expected better. Just not very good. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Really nice neighborhood restaurant. Good service. Decent prices. Nice beer selection. Live music from time to time. And DOG FRIENDLY!

I live in the area and when I compare the staff at Old Pueblo to Red's Bar and Grill down the road, there is no comparison. This restaurant likes to earn my business with consistent food, service and being welcoming of my dogs and other dogs. Considering it's in the middle of a neighborhood and their patrons often walk there, this is good business.

Red's Bar and Grill told me they were dog friendly, but when I took my well behaved dog there, they didn't tell me my dog wasn't welcome until after my food arrived. It was bad business and I won't go back to Red's even though I live nearby. Plus their food sucked.

Old Pueblo has earned my business."}
{"text":"Food was good. Drinks were good. Service was so so. Had to ask for my wife's drink twice. When it came it was wrong. Then we were double charged for her drink on the bill and had to argue our case with the waiter to get it corrected. We should not have to audit our restaurant bill and fight to get to pay the right amount.

We will come back as we are new to the neighborhood and realize that sometimes any staff can have an off day. 

The restaurant may want to invest in a POS system though as the waiter didn't know what we ordered. He apparently added up our bill by looking at the glasses and empty plates on our table......."}
{"text":"Service was great (Even though we were in a very large group, and probably got a little noisy as the night went on).

Drinks were perfect!

Food was bland.  No flavor, and not cooked well (overcooked enchiladas are chewy like a Charleston Chew candy bar--yuck).  When we got back to the hotel we actually had to order some food to satisfy our hunger since no one really ate the food we had at dinner."}
{"text":"We had to wait a long time for our food . We had ordered fish tacos. The food is really good . The picco is fresh and tastes amazing. Stick to margaritas! I ordered a Bloody Mary and had to send it back."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something different tonight and I found it. The night that I went there was nobody sitting inside but all but one of the tables outside had people in them. There was a great patio, very open and connected with other restaurants and bars so it was a very social setting. The other reviews talked about the pico de gallo , I must agree it was nice chunks of fresh cut tomatoes, onions and all that other good stuff. the drink prices were super reasonable and my party even opted for a pitcher of the house margarita, only $20! Our server suggested the Mexican flag enchilada plate which I picked. It was a chicken, steak and spinach enchilada with rice and beans. This was a huge plate of food, took half of it home. I was very happy with the food, the service, the drinks and the atmosphere, definitely will go back."}
{"text":"I had a dinner with my friends a few days ago. It was a weekday night but very crowded, we sit outside and I enjoyed the ambience. I had chicken tacos and it was okay but taco shells taste old. Corn chips are stale."}
{"text":"This pains me to say, since we were regulars here, but as this place grows in popularity, the quality drops drastically. I still enjoy the salsa (separate pico de gallo and hot sauce that you mix table side) and the pre-cooked selections (green chile pork for instance). However, the last few times we have been there, we got soggy tacos, poor service and cold food... which is just inexcusable. There is NO quality control. Food should never, ever be allowed to leave the kitchen in such condition, but no one is checking.

On top of that, we have been in this place at least 10 times when the owner was present, and he is an issue. He likes to schmooze with the pro's from the golf course, but if you are just  a patron, you don't count. I saw him in a confrontation with another customer over the service and instead of listening to the guy's valid complaint (customer was a little over the top, but that is par for the course these days), he stomped off in a huff. That told me that he just didn't care what the guy had to say.

Add to that, when we sent back our soggy tacos, we were told by the owner, \"that's kinda how we make them here\". So, you seriously dip a taco into hot oil so that it comes out soft and mushy? That was the most ignorant and maybe arrogant thing I have ever been told in a restaurant. 

The kitchen itself is very small and there is no way to get food out quickly to the number of patrons that they can seat, especially when the patio is full. So, when crowded, stay away. The food takes forever...like 40 minutes up to an hour...and it probably won't be up to snuff. If it is a slow day, you have a decent chance to enjoy a good meal, but you just never know what to expect. 

A word of advice to the owner: Either don't seat more customers than you can serve or expand your kitchen. You are starting to alienate the locals. 

If it wasn't for the Litchfileld Park location and the ambiance of the area, this restaurant would die in three months."}
{"text":"We keep coming back so that must say something... The food is good.. Sometimes it a miss though.  But hands down the worse service ever and that never changes each time we come back!!  Food good.. Could be better and don't charge for sour cream but let's get the service better please, would hate to stop coming here"}
{"text":"My nacho craving was back so I decided to drive down here to get some!  I read an article online stating that the nachos at The Old Pueblo Cafe were some of the best in the West Valley.  I had to check them out and confirm that myself!  I drove down, walked inside and was told to sit wherever I wanted.  I grabbed a table outside (the outside patio area is huge btw) and was brought some chips and 2 kinds of salsa.  The chips were pretty good...thin, crispy, salted fine.  The 2 salsas were a pico de gallo and one that was in a squirt bottle...more like a hot sauce than a salsa.  They both tasted fine.  The pico was actually really good and refreshing.  I ordered a water to drink and placed my order for the Old Pueblo Nachos with shredded beef.   Here is how they were.................

Old Pueblo Nachos ($9.95)-  These things came on a massive hot plate!  These nachos had a ton of crispy and sturdy chips, pinto/refried beans, melted cheese, shredded beef, sour cream, guacamole and a little lettuce and tomatoes.  Could have done without the lettuce but I think it was just for presentation purposes anyways.  The nachos were great!  The shredded beef had a bunch of green chilis in it.  It was delicious!  The cheese was melted perfectly, the beans were hearty, and the chips were warm and crispy.  A tad bit skimp on the sour cream and guacamole but most places are like that anyways so I can't complain.  I did my best and devoured about 75% of them and was stuffed to the brim.  Definitely a delicious and plentiful order of nachos!

Service was friendly.  The waiter was very quiet and mellow and so was the lady who brought out my food.  They were both nice though and checked on me throughout my meal.  I don't know when I will be back just because it is a little bit of a drive from where I live (20 minutes or so) but the chips, nachos and service were definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"This place sucks, not good Mexican food. The Taco Bell I had the other day was more authentic."}
{"text":"I recently had the chance to go back to Old Pueblo Cafe and found that its a bit more industrial than original.  On this visit, my dining partner had a fish enchilada with rice and beans.  It had the appearance of being hand assembled and she claimed it to be quite tasty.  The beans were good and assisted in making the rice a whole lot better when mixed together.  

My meal was that of a Green Chili Beef Chimichanga.  The same rice and beans were served and they were palatable when mixed together but the Chimi seemed like something that was taken from a frozen food locker and warmed up to be served.  There was nothing fresh made or original about it.  Yes, the filling was flavorful but the presentation and appearance looked pre-packaged and not fresh made.  This is a huge issue for me as Mexican food is very cost effective as well as simple to make in any kitchen.  

The pricing is a bit high as well, especially for food that is pre-made and just warmed up.  Maybe the rent is high in Litchfield but not enough to pay almost $11 for a frozen Chimichanga.  

Cocktails....we both had the house Margarita and while it was tasty, I think $5.95 for a non-call-alcohol made drink at happy hour is a bit much.  The size was OK but the overall quality for the value is still not there. 

Yes, I will go back on occasion as I am local and its about 200 yards from the house but if I am looking for authentic Mexican food, its time to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's not on the regular menu, but their green chili burger is amazing!! We shared the burger and got half and half fries and onion rings. It's SO messy and delish!"}
{"text":"One of the things I miss most about living in Litchfield Park is being able to pop into Old Pueblo for some delicious Mexican food.  I usually stuck with the two crispy tacos which always came out piping hot and stuffed full of meat and cheese.  Their goat cheese quesadilla is pretty legit too.  

If you're craving Mexican and are in the area, it's a great place to stop!"}
{"text":"The service was very good...we were well taken care of. However, the place is grimy and in huge need of some updating. Filthy grout on the floors...chipped paint on the walls...pictures hanging crooked.  Really???   Also...it smells like bleach...which does not mix with food.  I ordered the chili rellenos and salad. It looked like scrambled eggs with chili. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Why oh why isn't their decent food in the SW Valley? I really wanted to like this place- went for lunch today. Service was not good at all. The wait staff was inattentive and lazy. They don't give you dishes for chips and salsa. The waitress brought our food out and was holding our hot plates with a dirty blue towel. The food was tasteless which was a big disappointment because the menu choices were decent. The food was bland- I had the chile relleno and the spinach enchilada- no flavor. House margarita was watered down and too sweet. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Simple delicious food.  Many people do mess up refried beans.  They don't.  Not much alcohol in their margaritas.   Am I'm a lightweight.  Oh well.  Def would eat there again.  Loved the food."}
{"text":"Showed up and we didn't even get drinks until sitting for 10 minutes!!! I ordered a drink from the bar and it was the worst margarita I've ever had... Isn't this a Mexican restaurant?! Waitress came back to inform us that they were all out of carne asada.. On Mother's Day you think they would have been prepared. From being so frustrated with the service we just asked for our bill. She comes out with the bill and its a total of $83!!! Do they not bother to review the bill before bringing it out? I go in to get it fixed, that took forever. Then waiting for her to come get my card took so long that I had to pull another waiter aside to take my card for payment. I could understand this type of service if it was busy, but with 1 table inside and only 5 outside with 3 waiters working is NO excuse. Never coming back again. Very upset with the service."}
{"text":"they were really accomodating for a large party we had (40).  we got tables outside; which was a little warm for August - but that was our fault for being in such a large party.  I got their green pork burrito and it was amazing!  tasty but not too spicy.  Margaritas were great.  and the black beans and rice were good.  Reasonable prices for Mexican.  Nice choice if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Food was above average but i will definately come back for the great pico de gallo salsa!"}
{"text":"I kind of stumbled on this place. Hidden in the Wigwam amongst a series of other restaurants and small businesses this place turned out to be a pleasant surprise. They start you off with fresh tortilla chips made from scratch and home made pico de gallo. Both are very scrumptious. I asked what they would recommend and she said \"anything carne asada is delicous.\" I then went on to Yelp to verify other reviews. Her recommendation seemed to backed up by those on Yelp. So I figured why not? I ordered the carne asada tacos. The carne was plenty flavorful and tender. The surprise was how good the tortillas are. They are hand made there in a process that takes two days. From what I was told they make there own dough then in turn make there own tortillas. The quality is in the taste. 

All in all I would highly recommend this place because of the quality of food, ambiance, and friendliness of the staff."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! I take my mexican food serious and I was impressed with the quality of food at this place. The family and I are here on a Saturday night on the patio. It was beautiful outside. The kids had taco meals and my husband and I split the two tacos and two enchiladas combo. When then good came out, they had already split it on two plates and gave us generous portions of rice and beans. We also ordered a fish taco- we will pass on that next time- Too rubbery and super salty. We didn't even finish it. Overall a great place with great atmosphere."}
