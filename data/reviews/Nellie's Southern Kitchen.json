{"text":"Fabulous meal and great entertainment tonight, and the service was excellent.  The first time we went to Nellie's, the service was terrible and the food disappointing.  Tonight's visit was the polar opposite.  The food (chicken & dumplings with chunky apple sauce, and herb grilled chicken with mashed potatoes with gravy, and grilled vegetables followed with the pineapple upside down cake) was superior.  The service was excellent and the entertainment was simply outstanding.  A true evening of great food and fun.  I think they have gotten their act together.  So, if you went when Nellie's first opened, do yourself a favor and give them a second chance.  I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cajun grilled chicken sandwich was amazing as was the Four Cheese Mac & Cheese with bacon! Ambience and decor was a great addition to Belmont as well. The only problem we found is that we're stuffed! Kudos to the Jonas' and we'll be sue to recommend to all of our Abbey friends"}
{"text":"Delicious !! Great customer service on the roof top and the weather made it all the more amazing. Highly recommend the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer. I wasn't a fan of the mixed drinks they had prepared and they were kind enough to swap it out until I found the one I settled with. The food was amazing and it made me forget about the drink situation. I recommend going around 6 to hear the live music, we heard them from downstairs and they were pretty good."}
{"text":"Great Dinner - Meatloaf, BBQ Pork, Salad and Deserts were terrific!   Venue has a tremendous atmosphere, especially for the area.  This is a nice addition for dinner. Some of the other reviews noted service as a bit lacking.  We found the service to be great. The only reason that they do not have five stars is due to a fairly narrow menu offer.    Given time and patron and owner patience Belmont and the surrounding community has a nice jewel added to the crown of independent dining choices."}
{"text":"Positives: really really good food and beautiful decor.  Rooftop deck looks awesome but it was raining.  Negatives: everything else.  We waited over 30 minutes after we were seated before a waitress came over, and that was after i walked to the hostess stand and asked for one.  Then she pops over and literally asks what we want.  We ordered drinks and food for our toddler. She brought drinks for 4 of the 8 people and didn't come back till again I asked for our waitress again.  Anytime a drink was needed we had to ask a host for help.  Finally we wrapped up and had to ask for our bill.  They had the nerve to build in a 20% tip on the bill. I told the manager our checks were all wrong and we didn't want to pay 20% for the worst service I've ever had.  She was annoyed brought our checks and didn't come back. Not one sorry, not one smile.  Horrible service and not worth your money."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating the local flavor in Belmont while in town on business.  I tried Nellies which had a cool atmosphere and live music but let me down in the food dept.  The food was barely warm and tasted like it had been cooked for hours.  I had fried chicken that I couldn't even eat.  I left 3/4 of my food on the plate and the server never asked if there was a problem.  The locals recommended this place but I was completely disappointed and can't recommend anyone trying it."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good.Glad they re-used an  older building with southern charm and nice layout. That's all for the good. We had reservations for 12:30 and received our starter at 1:30 ( one order of chicken strips)  When our brunch came out , my fathers and mine order was wrong and then was told they had run out of chicken & waffles . I would say wait a couple months before a visit , if they are still in business you may be fine.  Two stars for their decor and location . I stay with Sammy's or Old Stone.   Tony gunk"}
{"text":"The food was excellent!  I cannot wait to eat there again.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is an excellent experience.  There is live music playing all the time at just the right level of volume (though it is a lively, loud atmosphere - don't go for a quiet business meeting).  The wait staff are mostly singers -- good ones -- and they get up on stage and sing songs.  They are truly talented people.  The owner also sings, but mostly spends his time walking around making sure everyone is satisfied with their meal and experience.  The food is outstanding.  Get an appetizer - you don't be disappointed.   The atmosphere is very unique; you will feel like you're in another city.  The rooftop is incredible - have a drink up there while waiting on your table if you're eating inside.  It overlooks city hall in downtown Belmont.  I almost want to keep this place a secret so it's easier to get a table . . ."}
{"text":"The 2 stars are given for the service, because if I based it on the food alone no stars would be awarded. The host was very friendly, as was our server. It took awhile for our drink order to be taken and then longer for them to arrive. Only a handful of tables were filled.  We ordered an appetizer (onion rings) that took awhile to come, but when it arrived it was lukewarm and doughy. Within one minute of the appetizer arriving, our entr√©es arrived. I sent the appetizer back to be reheated. When we tasted both dinners, they were room temperature. The fried chicken was burnt, yet room temp. Sent those back as well. I will say that the refired food was hotter, but not piping hot.   Our server tried to make everything okay for us, even giving us a free dessert. After I got home and decided to post this review, I read some of the previous reviews. I wish I had read them first, or better yet, I wish the owners would read them. Mistakes that occurred 2 and 3 months ago are still going on.   Giving away lots of free dessert won't kill your business, but not getting repeat customers just might. There are many good (and less expensive) dining options in Belmont. I'll be spending my money at those establishments instead of at Nellies."}
{"text":"After searching for a nice place to dine with my parents, I stumbled upon Nellie's. Of course I had heard of the restaurant but it did not immediately come to mind as my family and I do not live in Belmont.  However, this was definitely worth the short drive. We started with the pecan crusted green tomatoes...they were an absolute hit with everyone at the table. Perfectly crispy and not at all greasy.  Dinner was also delicious. Among our orders were the chicken and dumplins, salads and lots of sides. Everything was delicious.  I cannot recall the name of the featured cocktail, it consisted of blackberry, lime and Charlotte-made whiskey. Consistent with the rest of the experience, the cocktail was also delicious!  Most of all, we enjoyed the atmosphere. The restaurant was very clean and the decor superb. The band played an array of songs that were all crowd pleasers. Not too loud but just right. We loved the staff joining the band for different songs throughout the night also- what a fun touch!   What a great place to celebrate Mom's birthday...We cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came in at lunch so expected a little wait. Didn't get drinks until 10 min sitting unattended after being seated. When biscuts finally came they were great.  Our food came out in 14 min. But was huge and tastes great. The blackened chicken sandwich was ok. The bread it came on was soft and flavorful.  Fries were average fries. The real problem we had was the service. We expected some wait but after seeing those around us get fantastic quick service I realized it was just he waitress. What should have been hour tops for lunch was 1 1/2 for blt and grilled chicken with fries. I'd like to come back but wait staff needs to up the game.  It was nice seeing the chef out and greeting the customers."}
{"text":"A wonderful southern brunch, complete with live music and attentive care. Denise, the owner, offered true Southern hospitality with a warm welcome and a personal visit to our table. She shared the story of Nellie's Southern Kitchen, her inspiration and her family story (music runs in the family, her children are the Jonas Brothers.) Highly recommend this restaurant and loved the chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"Had a reservation, but we still had to wait about 30 minutes. We finally got seated and we ordered immediately. Had to wait another 30ish minutes to get biscuits, then we had to wait a while longer to get our food. Overall waiting time until we got our food was just over an hour and we had a reservation. I had the shrimp and grits. It was pretty meh. The grits had hardened a little on the outside by the time it got to us and it wasn't very smooth. The shrimp was okay, the bacon didn't add much to the dish (how did they manage to make bacon so sad??)   I would give just one star, but the live music was pretty good and it's the holidays so. Not going to come back though. Shrimp and grits is way better at old stone."}
{"text":"Second time eating there, last time eating there.  Horrible horrible service.  No silverware upon seating and when they brought out appetizers and we asked for silverware,they acted like we bothered them. Meatloaf is terrible.  Mashed potatoes were cold.  Corn was straight from the can and barely warm.  They sat us in a private banquet room and then forgot about us.  So let me explain the one star....you have to give it one, and then the chicken and dumplings were decent"}
{"text":"Great southern food and definitely one of the better southern style places in the area to eat. Slightly upscale setting and live music which sounds great.   NC pulled pork sandwich is awesome because they got the barbecue sauce ratio just right. Mac and cheese is a slight twist on a family favorite.   If you want some southern food and are in the area be sure to check this place out. Beware tho, parking is limited and we were warned about one spot being an unmarked tow area."}
{"text":"Went here for first time for lunch yesterday and was disappointed. Yes decor is nice, but food was below average.  I got the Southern Bella (portabella burger) and slaw which was OK, but I've had better - maybe a little overcooked?  My date got the Signature Fried Chicken and fries... figured this place must know how to do fried chicken, right? Wrong.  It came WAY overcooked - burnt.  Despite the place being almost empty, service was kind of slow and we had places to go. We couldn't wait for our food to be made a second time, so no, we didn't complain.  But seriously... you shouldn't have to complain about your food.  Quality restaurants won't let it happen.  When the cook pulls your chicken out of the fryer and it is dark brown like the color of a Hershey Bar, he should say to himself, \"Whoops. This is burnt. I need to make a new one.\"  And if he does put it on a plate, then the waitress should catch it and say, \"Hey... I can't serve this.\" Don't put badly prepared food in front of the customer, and think, \"well... if they don't complain, I guess it's OK.\"  It's not."}
{"text":"First time visiting in the area and a group of 6 of us went for dinner around 8pm. Highlights were: the pulled pork sandwich, fried chicken, mashed potatoes and the  mac and cheese. They had live music, which was loud, but fun. We also had dessert but I would skip the banana cream pie. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good food but the service is awful. The bar is always out of something (mint for Mint Julips, bitters for Old Fashion, one of the two types of house Chardonnay the server actually offers) but you don't find out until 10 minutes after you order. Even the draft beers ordered don't arrive at the same time. That's just the bar. I went for lunch before and they were out of turkey and out of Caesar dressing. It has become an on going joke and a game we play of what will they be out of next every time we go. Managers need to step it up. You can tell they have no restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Belmont's got a new belle and her name is Nellie!  Visited last night and had a terrific time.  Lots of local wines. Trout and catfish cooked to perfection.  A corn side that I could eat every night of the week.  Excellent service (sure, they're rushed - it's busy!) and a band that was spot on with every single song - including those sung by waitstaff and the owner who makes sure to chat with customers and makes you feel at home.  You're not going to have intimate conversations but the place oozes so much fun.  Goin' back on Saturday night..."}
{"text":"Visited Nellies yesterday for lunch when I was in town for a wedding. We were a party of eight looking forward to good southern meal before the wedding. Unfortunately that wasn't what we got. We waited over an hour for our food to arrive and then when it arrived it was cold and very mediocre! My father-in-law who is 90 and my mother-in-law who is 87 had to sit through this nightmare. My father-in-law's BBQ was so cold he couldn't eat it. When we told the waiter and manager of our dissatisfaction they said sorry and quickly left and avoided our table. There is no customer service! Obviously, they are banking on the \"Brothers\"! The one star is for the clean bathroom!"}
{"text":"Loved the appetizer, fried green tomatoes with fresh bed of greens and bacon. My dinner was exceptionally fresh.  Had the fried chicken breast with gravy, mashed potatoes and collards. Southern food with an urban twist. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"AMAZING food, service & environment! Went on opening night and service was spectacular! Live music and the waiters & waitresses would individually get up on stage & sing! I got the chicken & dumplings which were amazing! Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and was promptly seated.  Fast service and the food was great.  Fantastic atmosphere and prices were in line for this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"We were with a group that pre-booked lunch for 36 people.  When we arrived, the place was lightly full.  Restaurant sat us in room at back and provided only one waiter.  After sitting for 45 minutes not even having our order taken I found manager who came back to help.  Food arrived one hour and thirty-five minutes after our arrival in restaurant.  Food was good but, in my opinion, not worth spending over two hours for.  An clear example of restaurant mismanagement."}
{"text":"We have been to this place 3 different times. The food has always been delicious home cooked southern food. We love the atmosphere inside and the patio on a clear day. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because sometimes the service is slow. I don't know if they don't have it properly staffed or if there is another issue, but be sure you have plenty of time to wait when you go there. The wait is worth it when the food comes out. I've had the shrimp and grits, the blackened chicken, mac & cheese, turnip greens, and fried chicken. All were very good."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Got there at 6:00 pm.  Waitress handed us our menus.  After much deliberation I ordered trout and my friend ordered cat fish.  The waitress tells us that they are out of both entrees.  I mean there's not that much on the menu to even choose from.  Why didn't she tell us this when she first handed us the menus?  Then there's the house band or should I say was the house band.  Only one guy on keyboards."}
{"text":"I love this place. We get a great meal for two with live music with reservations all for less than $30 including a 20% tip. The food is great and very rich so don't over order. The atmosphere is happy and laid back. The staff are efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"Been looking forward to coming here.  Very disappointed to say the least.  Arrived at 5:15.  We were the only people there so I was expecting the food to be fresh & delicious.   My chicken was cold & had to be sent back.  I hadn't tried my 2 sides yet so when I did, they were barely warm but was too embarrassed to send them back also. We were seated next to the servers station which was a mistake.   6 servers in a small area laughing, talking & playing music different than what was playing overhead.   The saving grace was friendly staff, modern & clean decor and the cocktails!  Probably will not be back.  Afterall, I drove from Charlotte for this."}
{"text":"My husband and I were excited to try Nellie's for the first time last night for dinner.  I made a reservation on Open Table, and we were seated immediately upon arrival. The restaurant had live music, which was awesome, and the atmosphere was quaint overall.  We were seated next to the stage in a huge booth.  Fifteen minutes later, we had received a complimentary basket of biscuits, but had yet to see anyone to take our drink order.  My husband flagged someone down...who informed us that they were not our waiter, but they'd see about getting our drinks for us.  Another ten minutes went by...still no drinks.  A different waitress came over and said she was assigned to our table, but that the host station had not informed her that anyone was seated there, and asked again for our drink order.  Thirty five minutes after our arrival, our drinks finally came, and our food order was placed.  I ordered the meatloaf and my husband had the shrimp & grits.  I have to admit, (first world problems), that the food was okay, but in no way made up for the service.  The meatloaf was dry, and overall mediocre.  I think that the most we saw of our waitress the entire night was the very end when she brought the check, and then quickly returned for the credit card for payment.  I honestly don't know that we will return.  The food was a little too pricey for the poor level of customer service that we received.  If you expect customers to see the value...you have to be valuable."}
{"text":"I had the summer salad and it was not good.   The salad had brown edges on the rim of the lettuce leaves and the grilled shrimp was dry. The fried onions toppers were cold and mushy.   The food left me less than satisfied. However, the wait staff were friendly and attentive to our needs. I will not go again."}
{"text":"Went to Nellies last weekend and I was very impressed! The atmosphere was fun and super cool. The live music (which was a little loud but I had no issue with that) was good! The artists were talented. It was super cool to see our waitress go up and sing a song. The food was not bad although I felt like the chicken and dumplings could have had a little more salt (which I easily added) but aside from that, I enjoyed it! The mashed potatoes came with so much gravy which is exactly how I like it. There's a rooftop bar that I definitely want to check out next time. Very very happy to have this new place in my town!"}
{"text":"Sat in the rooftop seating, food is good but service was awful.  We waited 10 minutes for silverware while our food got cold. Eventually had to run down and get it ourselves. Took another 30 minutes to get the check and barely any refills."}
{"text":"I admit I have not had dinner here, but I ADORE that they have a decent Sunday brunch in Belmont!  Long live the mimosa!!"}
{"text":"Fail.  Fail. Fail.  This place, with it's poor staffing and \"slammed\"  kitchen would not survive any other place than this little town.  Get more staff.  Period.  Quit being cheap.  We will NEVER be back.  Another example of great concept, poor execution.  Why 9 out of 10 startups fail.  Learn fast or this will be another Mexican place in no time."}
{"text":"Stumbled on Nellies after seeing the Botanical gardens. Busy at lunch so we took a bar table. Decor is terrific. Server was prompt and friendly, food was served in reasonable time and everything was DELICIOUS. Native  Southerners will think they are eating at grandma's again. Biscuits to die for, heavenly chicken and dumplings, Freebird sandwich was awesome and banana pudding was excellent. Diet shot all to hell but worth it. Nice patio for sunset and private dining room for about 35 people. Will be back next week for dinner and live music. Met Kevin, the owner, and Ben, the chef. A winning team and a winning place. Kudos."}
{"text":"Had a great meal - super staff - loved the decor - food was amazing. Host who seated us explained that Nellie was his great grandmother and the restaurant has kept up the family tradition. Wonderful, fresh southern food with a nouvelle twist. Chicken and dumplings was awesome. Creamed corn made us cry it was so good.  Desserts - OMG.  Best carrot cake ever and chocolate cake so rich and moist. All made there from scratch.  Great service. Reasonabe prices. Full bar.   Definitely 5 stars - worth a special trip."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. The food is great, the atmosphere is relaxed and the staff are friendly"}
{"text":"Shame on me. I actually ate here twice today. We are in town for a wedding and walked through the charming town of Belmont. We had lunch at Nellies. I ordered the chicken and dumplings my wife and sister had barbecue my food came like warm and they weren't lying it was a plate with chicken and dumplings in bland floury chicken gravy. The fries that came with the barbecue were cold. The service was pretty good, but the food was really blah.   We noticed they had live music and decided to come back for some entertainment. The place was packed. But it was the only game in town. We were a party of 9 so we grabbed some seats near the bar and ordered drinks and appetizers. I can say the food was consistent. It was just as poor at dinner time as was at lunch. Sweet potatoes fries were soggy, fries were cold. Chicken tenders were ok. I ordered the biscuits and gravy. It was absolutely tasteless.  I did not know you could buy sausage with no flavor. There wasn't even any pepper in it. The only saving grace was the mac and cheese. I didn't taste it, but it was a hit with those that had some.   The beer was nice and cold. The servers were personable. They earned the two stars. The music was good. So my advice is to go eat somewhere else and hit Nellies for a drink and some music."}
{"text":"Wanted it to be good so bad, but was disappointed.  Food was okay, service was horrible. The manager waited on us more than the server."}
{"text":"Tried this place after not going due locals telling me it was not good.  What a pleasant surprise.  Food was good and atmosphere was better.  The live music along with the staff participation made a great experience.  It's a southern comfort food menu.  No steak and lobster but that's ok.    The beer list could use some work given the great plethora of north Carolina breweries.  Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Not impressed,the music at Sunday's brunch was the highlight. Out of s party of 13 on another night out our entire party said it was mediocre and don't plan a third visit."}
{"text":"What an amazing spot. Visiting while on tour. Brought my cast here two days in a row. Kevin and Denise treated us like family and its the first time we've met. The food was amazing. Ignore the other reviews. You MUST come here. I always didn't come because of the bad reviews. Ill say it again, ignore them. Amazing!"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are nice. The rooftop waitress tonight was less than great. She ignored us as much possible resulting in waiting at least 30 minutes without being acknowledged. Finally walked up to the bartender to request service. He was apologetic and embarrassed as she was supposed to be serving us. He went out of his way to make up for it. She never apologized or tried to help us even after the crowd died down. She clearly had an issue with our table. All we did was walk in, but we won't do it again."}
{"text":"Went tonight with another couple based on several people saying how good it is. We had a 6pm reservation and got seated at 6:15. Ordered dinner by 6:30 and was served at 7:23. Dinner was cold, the catfish special was terrible. Way too much batter and completed saturated in oil. Spoke with manager who said she could get me something else, I declined. She then said she would take it off our bill. Bill came and it was still on there. I gave up at this point, because the staff was in such disarray the entire time we were there. The owner stood in the back corner the entire night and never seemed to get involved in helping his staff. I will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"First time visiting here today. Had a few friends tell me how great the food was and I was not disappointed. Everything was so fresh and delicious and our waitress, Robin, was very friendly and helpful.  Will definitely be coming back here!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely unacceptable service. Showed up at 7:15pm for dinner, waited 45 mins for a table, not too bad and there was a bar and live music. However, after being seated at 8pm, food was a 90min wait! And throughout the 90 mins we were notified twice that the kitchen was out of items so we all had to adjust our order. The waiter could not tell us when the food would come out so we left. What a disappointment. We had high hopes and just left hungry and disgruntled and very tired."}
{"text":"I loved the food--especially the Fried Chicken and Catfish. Cecilia Jonas Lucas was lovely and made us feel very welcome."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Absolutely great food and fantastic atmosphere. This is a great date spot. I had chicken with gravy, green beans, and drunken collards - all more delicious than I've eaten out. The building is very modern and the whole back hallway has Jonas Brother records and memorabilia."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and I gotta say the experience was perfect all the way! The food was amazing! The deserts (especially that carrot cake!) were amazing too! The waitresses were super friendly and very attentive. The owners were also super super friendly and came off as genuinely great people. Great atmosphere as well with live music. We all left full and happy! This restaurant is exactly what we needed in this area and it provided one of the best dinner outs we've had in a long time. Thank y'all very much! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I was excited to try out this restaurant. I love love love southern food. First impression was really good. Loved the decor and the layout of the whole place. Hostesses were very nice and helpful. They told us (on a Monday night) that our wait was 45 minutes. But said the bar and cocktail tables are first come, first served. We quickly snagged a cocktail table someone had just left. The biscuits were so perfect. They were a good size, had good flavor, and the salted butter was yumminess. A big perk for me was the Windy Hill cider on tap! And it was reasonably priced! My husband ordered the fried dark chicken with skillet mac & cheese and fries. I ordered the Cajun trout with trinity corn and drunken collards. My husband's meal came out on time but mine took about 30-40 minutes longer than his. I just kept nibbling on his meal, which made me really full. He had plenty of food and so did I, which says something about their portions. Anywho, the manager came to our table and was extremely apologetic. She took the trout off our bill and packed the trout and sides in a to-go box. My husband and I totally understood since the place has only been open several weeks now. Despite the trout incident, they're a really good restaurant. Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Great lunch yesterday at Nellie's. Robin, our server, was outstanding! The BBQ sandwich was delicious and the pimento cheese and bacon sandwich my husband had was outstanding.  The atmosphere is so interesting. The owners of the restaurant are the parents of the Jonas Brothers. I loved seeing all the awards the Jonas Brothers have earned throughout the years."}
{"text":"Just not learning. The service for lunch is slow, forgetful, for a 25% full restaurant.  This place needs active management and coaching and training of staff.   Food is already slipping. \"Pressed sandwich\" only crisp on one side ( not a pressed sandwich or incompetent kitchen) server could only remember one item at a time. Kept going back to kitchen or for drinks.  Pulled pork good, salad over dressed, cole slaw was horrible all vinegar no flavor.     Service is going to kill this place, and I will be sad for BELMONT."}
{"text":"It's very hit or miss here, depending on who is working the kitchen. We've had meals that were phenomenal and the same meal on a different day that were lackluster to the point of being bland. With the price point being on the high side, I just can't handle not knowing if what I'm getting is going to be good or bad this time.  The atmosphere is great though, I just wish the food matched it."}
{"text":"Great friendly service- shout out to Paulina! Excellent fried chicken- loved the pulled pork & 4 cheese mac! Homemade lemonade made fresh & ice tea better than the Capitol Grill! Belmont is lucky to have gotten Nellies!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken was greasy and mac and cheese lacked flavor...band was too loud for dinner...liked the building though.   Would prefer that waitresses not leave in the middle of taking our drink order to sing with the band.  Doubt we will return until things improve."}
{"text":"Went off the menu and added an egg and cheese to the Bird on a Biscuit. Did not disappoint."}
{"text":"We had brunch on Father's Day weekend. Service is a bit slower but that pace kindly reminded all of us all that we should slow down, it's Sunday dammit. They had live music, decent cocktails and a great brunch menu. I wanted one of everything. A little out of the way compared to our usual Charlotte brunch places but love the fact that our region is \"growing up\" and the towns around us are stepping up their food game."}
{"text":"Really wonderful experience!   We just moved to Gastonia from Charlotte and we are working to try all the local joints instead of racing back to what we know 20 miles away.  We had decent service (points deducted only for forgetting my husbands mixed drink and not bringing our item as ordered-bacon on the side) but other than that he was great.    Started with the crispy chicken fingers-they're crusted with captain crunch cereal and served with a chili jam.  This was delicious and a fun way to kick off brunch!  We then shared the French toast (lovely with their cinnamon butter!) and the shrimp and grits-tons of shrimp!!!   A side of Mac and cheese to round out our feast was the best I've had and my aunt has held my #1 spot all my life.  Sorry Aunt Jane!   The interior is perfect for a date, bringing out of town friends or just relaxing with your person-loved this whole experience!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, but equally as important we had an awesome waiter, Jake.  The atmosphere was great as well.  I was a little taken back by how good the entertainment was.  Overall it was an awesome experience and my family and I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went to Nellies for the first time. The place was really nice & everyone was so friendly. The service was really great & they had a band. We got the Chicken & Dumplings they were awesome. They have a full bar if you need a cocktail. I will definitely be going back & probably try the meatloaf or shrimp & grits. Go try it out you won"}
{"text":"Good food but nothing exceptional. Ate at the bar and received good service. I think they had their IPA and Pale Ale taps crossed. I never had a pale ale that tasted that hoppy. I had the chicken and mash potatoes with green beans. Good flavor on chicken. Potatoes were nothing to write home about. I would revisit after visiting the rest of Belmont establishments."}
{"text":"Recently moved to Belmont and was dying to try Nellie's.  Food is average and way over priced.  The only thing we would recommend is the biscuit and gravy appetizer.   We lucked out and came on a night they had live music which by the way was awesome. The decor is trendy and desirable. Food needs some help!"}
{"text":"A trip to Belmont isn't complete without a meal from Nellie's.  Great food, excellent service! Love the decor,  too!"}
{"text":"After reading numerous reviews regarding Nellie's we were hesitant to try it out until last Sunday. And I must say it was wonderful!  We were greeted with a smile at the hostess stand. We were seated in a booth that was surrounded by lovely decor. Our server Christian was kind, informative, and very attentive. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The cornbread waffle was ok - not my favorite. My husband ordered the breakfast plate and enjoyed every bite. Our favorite was the sweet Caroline sweet potato casserole. They had somebody playing the keyboard which was nice not too overbearing as far as sound goes. I enjoyed brunch very much and look forward to trying their dinner menu in the near future."}
{"text":"One star because we weren't able to eat at the restaurant when they did not honor our reservation. We made a reservation several days in advance on Open Table. We arrived at 6:55pm for our 7pm reservation time and were told our name would be \"added to the list.\" We waited for over 30 minutes to be seated, until it was obvious that reservation times were not being honored within a reasonable time. The restaurant was not distinguishing between walk-ins and reservations. We checked in with the front staff and still weren't seated so we left and ate elsewhere. I hope they honor reservations in the future so we could enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"Honestly, I felt like I was eating at my own grandmothers house. Great food, live music, and an \"at home\" feel. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy weren't terrible. Catfish poboy was bland. Pimento cheese appetizer was nothing to call home about. Mac cheese wasn't bad just...different. I gave two stars because the service was good."}
{"text":"I hate leaving a bad review but this place totally pulled this out of me. I went here with 6 friends and a baby after a day of checking out a local venue for two of said friends wedding.   Honestly we were trying to go to the string bean but they were packed. We went to nellies because they had a nice ambience and a bunch of open tables. We were able to sit immediately. After that everything goes downhill.    Once we are all seated, no server claims our table for over 10 mins. We are there hot, thirsty and no one gave us anything but a pile of menus. So finally one person gets our drink order (not a server) then finally about 15 mins in our server comes and introduces herself. She takes our orders, not asking things like \"what temperature would you like that burger\" (every one who ordered a burger could not eat it) or even simply letting us know what the chef specials were or bringing us a drink menu.   After she took out order she proceeded to tell us that she was brining is biscuits \"hot out of the oven\"-- then we watch her and half the wait staff go outside for breaks.   I was the only one at the table to order a cocktail-- it took 15 mins from ordering for the WAITRESS to make my drink. I had to remind her. Mind you, there isn't even more than 4 other tables being served and the staff is *literally* standing around.   So about 55 mins in there's still no food and one of us go to the manager. We didn't get utensils, we needed refills about 3-4x (another friend had to literally go up to the staff standing on the side chatting to get us drinks because our server was clearly trying to take a break). The manager comes to our table and in the most monotoned \"I could care less\" vibe, she apologizes.   Then the food comes! Over an hour in! Yay! NOT!!!! Everyone's food was luke warm to literally cold. It was very clear that the food was done earlier and it was just sitting out unclaimed.   Our waitress told us they were understaffed (they clearly weren't) then the manager tells us that the cook had a problem in the kitchen. (We saw that cook hanging out at the bar earlier btw). They couldn't even get their story straight!! Unbelievable!   Our waitress brings over a plate of nasty looking desserts and says we will each get a free one for the wait-- LOL!   After the manager comes a second time and asks us how the food is, we honestly tell her burgers are overlooked and cold, mashed potatoes are cold and gravy congealed, fries are cold, the batter on the shrimp and chicken is stale and cold, you get the point.... Not one of us had a plate we wanted to eat. Then they start bringing out HOT fries, new gravy, new biscuits... But at this point it was literally too little too late. It really just confirmed that the food we received was not fresh.   The manager came by to tell us that we didn't have to pay for the meal. We proceeded to tell her that they missed out on a ton of potential wedding business from our party, but again, her monotoned self could care less.   We did NOT want a free meal, we wanted a decent one. After a day of doing fun wedding things, our party was hungry, happy and severely let down. I would never recommend this place ever. It wasn't just the terrible service, but the food was less than mediocre.   It's a damn shame because I love supporting restaurants that use local fresh ingredients but that's the only reason why the 1 star is here.   Congratulations if you made it through this! Go eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Pretty good. We ate upstairs outdoors on a nice day. The \"Free Bird\" chicken sandwich was great."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant. Made reservations for 2 on a Saturday but didn't need them. Walked right in and the guy seated us at a large round table. Would have been a perfect view of the live music but that wasn't until later. Waitress brought mini biscuits. They were an odd color but tasted good. Our waitress was super friendly and pretty fast with clearing the plates and bringing refills. Ordered the Pimento BLT with collards and an extra side of mac n cheese. I'm super picky about my collards but was intrigued by the hot sauce description and they did not disappoint! Full of bacon and great flavor. The mac n cheese was good but it didn't blow me away. Pimento cheese was a little over powering on the BLT but tons of bacon and great buttery bread."}
{"text":"I am visiting the area and stopped by for lunch. Service was outstanding and love the friendly atmosphere! The artistic decorations are amazing and the stage makes it fun. Apps were great, the crusted fried green tomato was my favorite. Captain crunch chicken was a fun touch. I don't always like pimento cheese but I do now! For entree I got chicken and dumplings and it's one of the best recipes I've had. Not too heavy and tender, chicken was perfect. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Lovely decor. Upscale comtempory which was a pleasant for Belmont. My group of 8 got there right at 11am. Service was prompt and attentive. We ordered everything from salads, to shrimp and grits, chicken and gravy, hawg plate. Everything was delicious. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch when nearby restaurant was closed on Monday. Enjoyed great food (shrimp po'boy and side salad) and excellent service.  Shrimp was perfectly cooked with a delicious remoulade sauce.  The decor is well done and attractive."}
{"text":"Second time here, and they have fallen off since they opened. Chicken and waffles came out room temp to cold, and my livermush biscuit was warm not hot, livermush was over fried, barely any eggs on biscuit, cheese was still cold and unmelted. Service was not that good either, seen our waiter 2 times during our whole stay, once to take order then to give us our check. Overall not impressed,especially when bill came out and prices were higher than listed on the menu. Hopefully they can turn things around."}
{"text":"Have had mixed bag of experiences here but continue to enjoy coming here! Food is consistently good - have had both ends of the spectrum when it comes to service though. Have been for dinner and brunch a couple of times and have never waited to be seated. The atmosphere and decor is some of my favorite and the rooftop area is a great feature unique to the area! Will likely continue to bring friends here."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is wonderful. The food is excellent, but the service is very, very slow! I have eaten there 4 times, and it's been that way every time."}
{"text":"Went with a friend who's daughter would bus the table from any of the Jonas brothers.  The place was nice, food was great.  When in town, its a must eat at.  Have the biscuits and Gravy."}
{"text":"Waited a while before we checked this place out. At 6:40pm, I made reservations for 8pm. Got there at 7:15pm, just now sat down at 8:22. After we finally got our food, closer to 8:45pm, my husband's pork chop was so tough, he could barely get the fork and knife in it to cut it. On the other hand, my fried chicken, collards, and Mac and cheese were great. I highly recommend the Mac and cheese if you can stand the extreme wait times. On a side note,  when you see that many people waiting on tables and food but Mr. Jonas, the owner, sits in his throne booth overlooking all he surveys and isn't helping? Definitely a turn off for me. Update- In my defense, how are customers (specifically people who have never been there before) supposed to know what's happening in someone's personal life? It's all about perception. So while my comment may seem unfair, it was my truth based on the information I had at the time. I pray that his cancer treatment goes well."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try Nellie's after having driven by it so many times. The decor is beautiful. That was about the only positive thing I can say.   Upon arrival we were seated with no wait, restaurant wasn't overly busy. Our waitress, the hostess, then the waitress again came over to take our drink orders three different times because they couldn't remember. This should have been a red flag but we continued and ordered.   After ordering it was an hour and fifteen minutes before HALF of our food arrived at our table. People around us came and went. Ordered and ate, while we still had nothing in front of us. Our waitress was apologetic, but around the hour mark we finally asked the hostess what was going on. Her EXCUSE was that there were several parties in the back. I say excuse because in no way should large pre planned parties disrupt your regular restaurant. You have plenty of time to prepare and make arrangements. Fifteen minutes later half of our parties food arrived. The other came our five minutes later, with a side order of fries coming out AFTER everyone had already finished.   Mind you no one ordered complicated things. 2 orders of biscuit and gravy (I am assuming both are already made), and a pulled pork sandwich. I could have made both things quicker at home. The hostess never apologized, the waitress, while nice, asked if I wanted another drink with my dinner even though she would have to charge me for it. Well obviously my drink is gone, we had been sitting for an hour and fifteen minutes I didn't know I would have to ration it to enjoy lemonade with my meal.   The biscuits and gravy were good. The mac and cheese and sweet potato dish were good. The pulled pork came out cold, and the fries were less than fresh.   This experience was such a disappointment given how much we love downtown and were eager to enjoy it here. I wish I could say we would be back, but it is highly unlikely."}
{"text":"Great experience all around. Staff was fantastic. Atmosphere is amazing. Live music. Food was delicious.   We had a party of 13. Made reservations. Everything was ready when we arrived. Ordered appetizers, fried green tomatoes and sweet potato waffle fries, very tasty. For the main meal I ordered chicken and dumplings with Mac and cheese. Words cannot describe the taste of this dish. Out of this world. Some of my coworkers ordered shrimp and grits and they all loved it. They also have some local beers on tap. For dessert order the banana pudding! And make sure to take a walk down the hallway in the back to see all the cool Jonas Brother pictures, we got a special tour from grandma! And don't forget to check out the rooftop bar.   Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing meal. Country fried steak was very tough as well as the greens. The meatloaf, even smothered in gravy, was very dry. We had a foursome and none of us liked our meals. We all agreed, we will not go back. Frankly, we could probably get better southern cooking at Cracker Barrel. $100 per couple for a terrible meal."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here a dozen or so times. We love the atmosphere and the music. However the food lacks, the menu is not very good and the food is worse. Of the half dozen times we've been there 50% of the time the food is cool or cold. Last night my wife had the skirt steak. It was cold and so tough that we may have to visit the dentist on Monday to get our Jaw realigned. The Jonas family has done excellent job with the venue and the entertainment however they need to hire a chef, get a new menu and make sure food is a not left setting to get cold before delivering to the tables.  We like many others noted on reviews want them to succeed. It is still new and many people come to celebrate birthdays or check out a new experience. That is carrying the restaurant now. Sooner than later if the food does not it improve The restaurant will fail."}
{"text":"Our first time here at Nellie' s. We had heard of this place and our 30th anniversary was a great time to check it out. We love the atmosphere and decor, a mix of rustic, industrial, upscale ambience - nothing pretentious, just a good comfortable, stylish feel. There was a 3 piece band playing and singing the Eagles \"Peaceful Easy Feeling\" and was that perfect or what? My beautiful bride of 30 years had the fried catfish with the \"best ever\" drunken collards and I had the Cajun chicken with potatoes and trinity corn. The food was fabulous, meats were tender, everything tasty and we had the StoryPoint Cabernet from Sonoma - it was one of the best wine we've had. We finished with the chocolate tower cake, which is exactly what it sounds like, with a chocolate ganache frosting. We most definitely will be back - and if you want a great meal, head on over to Belmont and settle down at Nellie's for a delightful experience. Robin was our waitress and she was just fantastic and made us feel completely welcome."}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  Fresh ingredients that offer a decadent flavor.  The fall salad is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp!  Started out my biz trip to Charlotte in southern style!  Dumplings & collards....great pairing.  Chicken and waffles with a twist, super delicious!  Nellie's is a must if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"May be the best meal I have had in the Charlotte area in some time. True southern classic cooking."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch today at Nellie's.  The restaurant is very tastefully decorated and the dining chairs are super comfortable.  We were a table of two and were asked by the hostess if we minded sharing a 6 top with another party of two.  We didn't mind and neither did the other two and that seating arrangement worked out just fine.    The menu is limited and my thoughts were maybe this was because they are still trying to work out what to offer.  I ordered the catfish po boy and my husband the hamburger.  First, the catfish consisted of about 5 fried, 2 inch catfish rectangular chunks, chopped romaine, diced tomato and a spread that was lightly applied on a very large roll of bread.  I felt there was not enough catfish on the sandwich and would have been better as a filet.  I couldn't get fish, lettuce or tomato all in one bite because there was so much bread.  Yes, I know po boy sandwiches usually are served on a large roll, but if there had been more filling, this wouldn't have been a complaint.  The spread was barely noticeable and therefore the sandwich lacked flavor.  The French fries were soggy and didn't come out piping hot.  All of this for $11.00. I would not order this again.  Secondly, the hamburger was on the small side and came out medium.  The server did not ask how he wanted it cooked.  The taste of the burger was o.k.  Again, his fries were soggy and not hot.  Normally we would eat all the fries on our plates, but not this time. The hamburger and fries cost $10.00.  The service was fair.  Our server was good but not especially attentive.    I would like to give Nellie's another chance on the food, but I think we'll try the bar and the music scene next time and skip the food."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Nellie's, it was absolutely great. Kim our server was great, the atmosphere was fun, had a live band. All around great place. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been many times since they opened and the food has consistently been amazing. Went last Friday and had an absolute blast singing backup for the band. The music was on point!  Butch, Destiny, I'll just call her 'Jolene', and the rest were tons of fun. Certainly recommend for not only a reasonably priced delicious meal, but also an experience you'll love in an awesome venue. The seasonal rooftop bar is also a cool place to hang when weather permits."}
{"text":"We had lunch there today.  On the positive side:  the portions were huge and the food service was very speedy.  On the negative side:  the fries and biscuit seemed a little greasy.  The roasted veggies seemed to have a vinegar taste and the bacon on my blt was a little chewy for my taste."}
{"text":"Met the Jonas Dad. Food was a bit pricey but the portions were hefty and delicious. House band was on point and the crowd was singing along. Definitely score a reservation there, walking in the wait would have been long if we hadn't. I'd love to come back when the weather is warm to check out the rooftop!"}
{"text":"We had a nice family dinner here. The venue is very nice and includes a rooftop bar. The fare is classic southern, and very well done. I had a fried chicken breast with mashed potatoes and gravy, it was delicious. They had some performers downstairs playing appropriate for dining music, well done, laid back and not too loud. Service was great."}
{"text":"Greasy food.  String bean,  Sammy's, and glenway pub are better and cleaner food.  The prices are high for the greasy food. Bojangles and kfc are half for the same type of food."}
{"text":"Out of tune  food and service in need of harmony spoil a lovely ambiance and good music. Three of our four brunch entrees were cold and every service request had to be repeated multiple times. Cornbread waffles and chicken sound like a good idea but the waffles are dry and tasteless. Weak watery coffee and small portions matched with premium pricing spell trouble for a new restaurant. We would to try it again just because the decor and music make it such a pleasant place to spend time. Please up the service and food standard!"}
{"text":"We sat on the rooftop patio which was really nice. Great, quiet atmosphere. Our waiter Christian was awesome! Super helpful, very nice and attentive. The food was amazing. Don't have complaints! Definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"We went here with a small group of about 8, brought by my sister-in-law that was so excited to show us this place. The decor is great, simple, southern charm with live music to come. We got a corner booth near the kitchen, close to the stage but not in front of the speakers so the music wasn't too loud. My daughters loved watching the band.  Unfortunately, when the food came, a wave of let downs were felt around the table. As other mentioned, no chicken to be found in the chicken and dumplings, over cooked meals, lacking flavor and a couple of orders that were just wrong.  Being in a southern, cooking like grandma used to do, type place, I went with the Fried Chicken, with Nana's Corn and Mashed Potatoes w/ gravy. Nothing on my plate was actually hot and sadly most of it was only barely warm. The corn was the best thing I tasted and that was partially due to it being sort of warm. Of all things I would expect the chicken to be hot, being a fried food and likely one of the last things to be plated, but it was not. The breading did taste like something grandma might of cooked, but only because it tasted like a bisquick thick batter with little more to it.   I don't like to give bad reviews. I've worked in restaurants and I know how hard it is to put out good food every day, but this was exceptionally bad. For the price we paid for that meal, it was a real let down. I feel like the place is riding a wave of success from being family of pop stars and that's only going to take them so far.   Get your kitchen in line and start cooking food that would make your Grandmother proud.   To add to the bad taste in our mouth we were charged for items we never received. I hope management gets things turned around."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant on a business dinner and were wowed by the great service and awesome food. Live music and cheap prices. Would recommend 10/10."}
{"text":"Amazing place!! I cannot say enough about this restaurant. We've eaten here for dinner and lunch - both of which have been outstanding! We've had the chicken & dumplings, the lovebug burger, the pulled pork sandwich and the Cajun chicken. So good!!! Service is great, prices compare to other places, atmosphere is awesome.  We love coming here and will return!!!"}
{"text":"As a nearby resident we have been quite hopeful for Nellie's to succeed.  After reading many so-so reviews ever since they opened we gave it awhile to visit.  We went for lunch on a weekday.  The dining room was only 20% full at the busiest hour of the day.  I found the decor to be quite stark and cold.  I understand they are trying to go for some sort of southern industrial chic, but the main restaurant consists of one big bare floored room, with cold steel backed chairs.  At least the booths along the side are a bit more cozy.  I guess since they have music on stage at night, they don't want anything separating tables.  We ordered a burger and the chicken and dumplings.  Our order took more than 35 minutes.  The staff and manager were pleasant, chatted with us and brought us some over cooked crunchy biscuits to snack on.  The burger was not too bad.  The chicken and dumplings had a good flavor, but it was all mushy.  I barely found any dumplings.  I don't often eat dumplings, maybe I don't know what they are supposed to be like, but this was just mush.  Every so often I would feel a very small lump of what I suppose was a dumpling.  It was nothing like pictures posted by others on this site.  Needless to say we were disappointed and do not feel the need to return; despite how badly we would like to eat in our local restaurants."}
{"text":"I really want to love this restaurant. I've been multiple times, but they lack in consistency. Sometimes the food has been great, other times just mediocre and even just terrible. The one thing that is pretty consistent is the service - it's slow and unprofessional. Everyone is always friendly, but it just seems like everyone there is working their first job and doesn't really know what's going on. I'll continue to go here because of their rooftop patio, but probably only for drinks, not for a meal. I do enjoy the live music and the atmosphere, especially during Sunday brunch. It's definitely worth visiting, but don't have high hopes for amazing food or service. It could happen, but not likely. Note: the prices will make you think it's going to be amazing food. I really hope the management takes steps to improve service and food quality; this place could be incredible if they do."}
{"text":"What a find!  I had the fried green tomatoes with portobello mushrooms and chocolate cake.  All were delicious!  The service was outstanding, and I am so glad I asked the hostess about Nellie.  The birds, the cotton lights over the bar, and the painting of Nellie all make sense now!!  Can't wait to come back to Belmont just to eat here!"}
{"text":"I'm so impressed with this place! Everything I had was great! It all tasted and felt homemade, especially the chicken and dumplings that I had. I also had the Mac and cheese and the trinity corn. My friend and I split the pimento cheese and toast points plate. She got the fried chicken. And we both had the biscuits. I recommend ALL of these things. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here, leaving full and happy. The portions are pretty big, too, so you won't be disappointed. The decor is really fresh and new, and it's clean. I wish I didn't live so far away or I would come here all the time!"}
{"text":"We had lunch at Nellie's. Service, atmosphere and food was very good. I recommend Nellie's. Today we ordered chicken & dumplings with creamed corn and shrimp po boy with side salad. We were both very pleased. They are a great added addition to uptown Belmont. Today we had no \"new opening blues\" that some have expressed. Give them a break. They just opened. If those things are going on after they have time to fix problems I pay more attention."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very charming and adorable. The concept is as well, as the wait staff (&/or bands) perform while you eat. With that, this is not the place to go if you plan on enjoying extensive conversation. But, it's certainly entertaining!   I decided to save a little money and just order appetizers/sides. Not being one to take many risks with my food (especially at new places), I ordered macaroni & cheese and chicken tenders. The chicken tenders tasted like the barely-even-mediocre tenders that I do on the stove top. They were excessively flour-tasting and overcooked. The macaroni looked delicious, but it didn't have much flavor at all and, again, was mediocre at best.   All in all, the atmosphere was unique and worth experiencing. I'll likely give the food one more go, but was certainly not impressed with this showing!"}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night at 7. Asked if we could the roof top and eat, all was good.   Next, we asked for a couple waters, and ordered our food.   Requested some rolls (biscuits), and the waitress said she get some for us. Emily was her name.   She was the most inattentive server we have ever had. 45 minutes later we were served our food. That is when we had to request silverware.   Minutes later the biscuits arrived.   The food tasted good, but was cold.   Then a party arrived and started smoking and swearing like sailors.   We immediately asked for the check and left.   We have gone to nellies several times and always have issues with the service there. The food is good, but service is horrible. Emily was indeed the worst ever.   The wife and I made a pack that we would never return. It is too bad, that restaurant has a bunch of potential with the nice location and unique dishes. We just don't care to be taken for granted."}
{"text":"After a third attempt to see if the service and food was any different unfortunately it was not and even worse. We were seated upstairs. We placed our order. When the order arrived the two children received their kids orders and one order for one of the adults was completely wrong and the other meal for the other adult came with fries instead of mashed potatoes. Mashed potatoes came with the meal so there was no discussion about anything on French fries. After waiting 5 minutes for silverware, we opened up the napkins and found two napkins filled with two of the same size Forks. The other napkin was filled with a fork. We then asked for knives. After about 15 minutes the adults meal finally arrived. Unfortunately, the two children and the other adult meals were nearly finished. When the correct adults meal arrived it was at room temperature at most. The baked macaroni and cheese were room temperature. It was apparent that the Grits had sat for some time because they had hardened  crust. It was so disappointing. The fried chicken plate arrived with one of the pieces of chicken extremely dark brown in color as if it were overcooked or refried. The other piece of chicken was golden brown. This has happened on a recent visit as well but the recent visit piece of chicken was extremely dark brown. When the check arrived, the wrong meal was removed from the ticket but they added mashed potatoes to the ticket. The mashed potatoes came with the adults meal. Then we had to wait approximately 10 minutes for the manager and waiter to correct the overcharge. Bad food and bad service is not a good combination for Nellie's. Unfortunately, after 3 attempts I cannot go back to this restaurant, nor recommended them. I don't see Nellie's serving the Belmont Community for many years into the future."}
{"text":"Not worth the price. I'll stay with Sammy's trying to go big time in a growing town and missed the mark. Don't think I'll go back for a while."}
{"text":"Hubby found this place online and we decided to give it a try. And we are very glad we did! Fun place. Went on a Friday night - had a reservation for 8:30PM. We arrived a wee bit prior and was promptly seated. Had an awesome table next to the stage & enjoyed the band tremendously. Ordered the fried green tomatoes - phenomenal (especially since I despise tomatoes!) Hubby had a few of their beers and I settled on the Front Porch Punch - delicious! I ordered their fried chicken, mashed taters & substituted corn for their collared greens (which my hubby had on his plate and he thoroughly enjoyed them). He had their other chicken plate with macaroni & cheese (oh my to die for yumminess), & collared greens. Took an order of shrimp & grits home for our son - very good also! And also took a slice of their chocolate cake home to share with our children. It didn't last long at all. All in all, this may become a new favorite of ours. We had a most lovely evening as we sat and ate and listened to the awesome live band. Very nice people, I might add! Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Nellie's Pick Me Up is now open. They're located adjacent to Nellie's Southern Kitchen. Their concept is simple and their food is good. They're open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. They offer breakfast biscuit sandwiches, regular sandwiches, pastries, an assortment of coffee and hot teas and to go packaged meals like rotisserie chickens. They also sell local products like local honey, wine, spices, etc. If you want a snack, quick bite or ready made meal then this is your place. The parking is still a bit awkward so beware."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The decor and music are fabulous however the service and food ruined the positives. We were waiting at the bar and had told the hostess we would be doing so. However when we went up to see how much longer she said she called our table already. They did seat us next though. After being seated we waited for 10 mins for someone to take our drink order. It took almost another 10 mins to get drinks. 2 of which did not show up.  The apps were great we had pimento cheese and onion rings. The lady refilling waters said do u want more bread for the pimento we said yes but never received it. The apps came out quickly but meals took 30 mins to arrive and when it did it was not even warm. Everyone's potatoes and gravy were cold as well as the mac and cheese. 2 Of us ordered the boneless fried chicken which was not what arrived when we cut in to it was a bone in chicken not a big deal except it made it impossible to eat since it was covered in gravy plus it was cold along with everything else. I asked for a menu since I was sure it had said boneless and once I pointed it out to the lady refilling our drinks she said no it is not I then showed her the menu and she said tell your server which I did and the server said she would remove them both from our bill. When we received our bill they were still on it as well as that drink we never got I pointed it out and she said she would remove both and the drink. Then the manger comes to the table and says I removed $8 since it had bones. I told him we had been told it would be removed totally he said he would rectify but then came back and said the cards had already been run so would offer us gift cards. When I got the check the drinks we never received were still on the check as well and we waited over 5 mins for the gift cards but at this point were so frustrated so just left. If you are thinking of making the drive from Charlotte don't waste your time"}
{"text":"Met my sweet gal friends for a really enjoyable evening.  We had great food and conversation and finished the night off on the roof bar with some wine.  It was a gorgeous night."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed by this restaurant, mostly because it was so hyped up by two of my co-workers who talked about it for months and how fantastic it was, how often they went, how desperately they needed to go back, and how every item they'd sampled on the menu was incredible.  We arrived shortly after six for dinner and got a table immediately, we were greeted by our server in a timely enough fashion and received our drinks and ordered pretty quickly.  It all went downhill after that.  It took nearly an hour for our food to arrive so don't go hungry.  One burger came with a bun and well done when ordered medium well and bun-less.  I had the shrimp and grits with a side of macaroni & cheese (because the girls hyped it up so much).  The shrimp and grits were pretty good, not the best I've ever had, but decent.  I enjoyed the grits the best.  The macaroni and cheese however was so bland in some areas and kind of gross in other areas.  I almost felt bad telling the girls that I didn't like it when they asked.  Lastly, we had to ask our somewhat bad server for dessert which was a mistake.  The chess pie was not very good, but the peanut butter pie was.  I won't go back.  Having owners with a famous family connection and being in a ritzy neighborhood might be enough to entice people to try Nellie's, but it's not enough to get them to return."}
{"text":"Little downtown Belmont was popping Thursday night on an unusually yet wonderfully warm February.  Every restaurant and bar poured on to the sidewalks aglow with happiness and cheer.    No longer a sleepy mill town, Nellie's is smack dab in the middle of the action.  And maybe that's where the struggle begins trying to light up all the stars.  Many comment the facility is decorated perfectly:  layout, space, furnishings, decor, etc.  Lovely yet masculine, too.  Unfortunately, I agree with Meleah S. who Yelped, \"I liked this place but I wouldn't make a special trip to Belmont for it.\"  Why?  Some of the food under-delivered and the service, while good, needed more attentive care (our waitress was incognito for most of the night).  For example, our appetizer was their Pecan Crusted Green Tomatoes with goat cheese, pickled veggies, and remoulade.  Sounds promising . . . however, they arrived almost black (pecans are oily requiring a deft hand on the griddle) and the remoulade was almost like our server: incognito.  Maybe our entrees will improve.  And they did.   My burger of hand ground blended beef was cooked a perfect medium rare.  Thank you, thank you, thank you . . . But, none of the condiments I requested got the memo.  I called Uber to drive my waitress back to my table arriving just in time for my last two bites.  The mac-n-cheese?  I'm pondering having an affair with it.  Yum!  I like Nellie's, love the concept, praise their decor and pray they take the extra steps to become great, not just good. If I lived here I'd be a regular.  My wife thinks 4 stars is generous and maybe she's right.   But, I support locally owned businesses who crank it out because something deep in their soul says they are needed.  And they are.  Four stars.  I say take a trip to Belmont and \"give 'em a whirl.\"  Tip:  make reservations and tie a balloon to your server to find them more easily."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I didn't plan on doing a review so I didn't get any pictures. Sorry!    The biscuits that came out before the meal looked great. I unfortunately did not try them because it didn't fit into my current diet. Everyone else's really enjoyed them. I prefer the blackened chicken, mixed grilled vegetables and sweet potato Caroline.   The chicken was ok at best. The seasoning was pretty good but the chicken itself was super thin and not very big. It was not a \"fresh\" chicken breast by any means. It for sure was not the star of the plate the way it should be. The single chicken tender my wife got with her chicken and gravy looked fresher, juicier and bigger.   The mixed vegetables were good. A little too much butter or oil for me but was good. They didn't over cook them to mush like most places.   The sweet potato Caroline was good. The candied nut topping was tasty but again prob to sweet for what the should have been eating. Reminded me of a dessert type item. Overall very tasty though.   We skipped dessert so I can not comment on that.   Our bill was $40 after tip. Not bad but more Thani would expect considering the grilled chicken was sub par."}
{"text":"The 5 stars are for the Ambience and staff!!!!  With that being said, to get that feeling you will need to make your reservation for the tables by the band.  Otherwise I'm afraid it will just be plain boring!!But be aware even if you make a reservation doesn't mean they will have it when you arrive.  They couldn't find ours but they did seat us very quickly. The wait staff singing is cool, but I have to keep in mind it's a new restaurant and they have yet to work out all the kinks.  Long waits for your food or it coming out split up ( I got my food 10-15 minutes before my husbands) as for the food...... Boring, not bad just boring. Menu very small, i think there are 5 entrees. I had the meatloaf, which in my opinion is a ball of Hamburger with no flavor, it definitely needs the gravy. I asked for extra gravy and was brought chicken gravy?????? Not the gravy that was on my plate. Mashed potatoes were good but not hot, I was not a fan of the green bean casserole.  My husband had the catfish... Needed seasoning, same with the fried green tomatoes, if you don't eat them with the sauce \"0 flavor\".  If I had to say anything was bad it would have to be the \"Collards\" absolutely terrible!!! They are very sweet, this is the south and collards are NOT sweet!!!  So to wrap this up, will we go back???  Absolutely for the band and the bar!!!!!!  We will give the menu another try, but further down the road."}
{"text":"Food was fine.  Portions tiny. Music great. If your going to charge 15.00 bring a piece of chicken. Breast was 4 ounces at best. Fall salad nothing special.  Skip this joint."}
{"text":"Best southern kitchen!! Such a wonderful atmosphere that's made by dim but not dark lighting and beautiful interior design. There's live music to listen to while customers eat the most delicious food one can imagine. The owners there are so kind, they really take the time to talk with their customers even though must be very busy. Overall 11/10 (the extra point is for the fried okra, yum!)"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential.  The food just wasn't on par with the atmosphere.  The food was not fresh.  It seemed like it was made the day before and reheated.  Also, the food temperature was lukewarm at best.  The mac and cheese had good flavor to it but again was not fresh.  I hope they can up the standards of the food because it really could be a great place."}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and myself came here today, Sunday at noon time. We were told it would be about a 45 minute wait. We were ok with that. After 30 minutes we were seated. 20 minutes later having not been waited on or anyone acknowledging that we were there, I was angry and we left. We went to Sammy's down the street and got to eat quickly, and good food to, and not overpriced like that Nellie's menu would have been. Kind of glad we didn't eat there after that anyways."}
{"text":"This place is fairly new and has a nice layout and a good looking restaurant. The food is all southern style comfort food, not a huge selection. It is pretty good though and I have been here a couple of times. It is a bit pricey for what it is but I guess that is to be expected for the location and all the work put in to the place. I am not a fan of the silver ware the forks are quite curved for some reason. No need to reinvent the fork it has worked for centuries."}
{"text":"Had a gathering with family and friends...reserved a room from 5 - 9:45 pm...great food and awesome service for 35 people...Thanks Heather and  Jackie for making my birthday sooooo memorable...if you don't consider this    Spot for your next gathering...ur crazy"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Nellie's for awhile but was hesitant with the mixed reviews and how busy it seems to be. I took the plunge and made reservations for a family birthday celebration since we had a larger party. I was pleased our table was ready and we were seated right away. The details of the decor and sweet ambiance was a definite plus. My family approved of the menu selection and all of us enjoyed their food. The only drawback was many in our part commented that our food was cold. Several of us had the chicken and dumplings, which were delicious and tasted like homemade. The portions were generous as well. Overall it was a great experience and I will be back again."}
{"text":"Fried green tomatoes best I've ever had.  And YES that includes anywhere in South Carolina.  They are pecan encrusted and served with the most flavorful remoulade ever.  Be sure to ask for an extra bowl of green river sauce - it.  is.  amazing.   Think pesto, heavy on the lemon.  I know this dish is delish b/c it was scrumptious even after it cooled down.     Spring salad was devine... I ordered with both shrimp AND smoked bellas - WELL worth the additional cost.   And not sure what they coat the fried chicken with, but it is food of the gods.   Atmosphere so comfortable, clean, and homey.   Service fast and friendly.  Food is fierce.   My new fave."}
{"text":"Service was great!  The music was nice too!  I had the Carolina burger and it was decent but I felt it was lacking something. The coleslaw was kind of dry. Wasn't a huge fan of the chili on it. The Mac n' cheese was amazing. My husband got the chicken and dumplings and the collards. Both were good but the dumplings also lacked something. For dessert we had the peanut butter pie and it was amazing!!! Very lite but rich and delish!"}
{"text":"Wife ordered pulled pork sandwich.  Don't know how one can get a dried out piece of pulled pork(oh I know-microwave the hell out of it).  Couldn't even chew it. I had a burger that was suppose to be medium but came out well done on a burnt blackened bun.  The mac and cheese was very good though. The waiter started out strong, quick refills on drinks.  But as soon as the food got delivered(not by him but kitchen staff), that was the last we saw of him until near the end of the meal.  Then we had to wave him down for the check. Lots of people waiting for a table and they could of had ours 15 minutes earlier if the waiter had given us the check when he should of.  Poor food quality + poor wait service = no return business from us."}
{"text":"This place could be so much better. They are located in a prime spot in Belmont NC and a wonderful structure but the complements end there.  We went on Saturday at noon and sat up top on their terrace. Service was slow, they got my beer order wrong, the hamburger was well under cooked to what I ordered. Plus, there is very little option for someone that doesn't eat MEAT, like my wife, however we knew that before coming. I think Nellies Southern Kitchen has potential but I am not so sure if they know what direction they are heading? With other nice places in the area and new places opening, I am sure Nellies will be able to keep it going? I certainly hope so!"}
{"text":"I must have been at some other Nellie's. I had high hopes after reading the reviews. The waiter had to return to the table 4 times because they had run out of things got our drink order. The appetizers were good, especially the pimento cheese. I ordered the Chicken and Dumplings. It was shredded chicken in a flavorless gravy with mushy dough balls. The only thing that saved it was the pepper I dumped on it. We had to ask a different server to clear dirty plates because ours was too busy folding napkins.   I will not return or recommend Nellie's"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! I have been dreaming about it since I had it a week ago. The fried chicken was delicious and the chicken and dumplings were specular!! The drinks were very great too. If the food and drinks were good enough the wait staff blew me away, southern hospitality, super attentive, and crazy talented when they would go on the stage to sing! What a fun night out!! :)"}
{"text":"I've never been in a place that takes over 1hr to get only for 1 glass of wine. Can you imagine how long the food took to get served? Over 2 1/2 for a party of 5. I was sitting at the rooftop. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Southern Cuisine done right with a Creative Twist.  This restaurant has been on my radar since they opened last June but since Belmont is not exactly in the neighborhood, was relegated to a One of These Days status. Two things happened this week which changed this.  One was one Good Morning American on Monday they were showcasing the restaurant and some of the dishes served which put the restaurant back on the active radar and secondly, my wife was flying back into Charlotte from Pittsburgh today and the restaurant is less than a 15 minute drive from Charlotte Douglas Airport.  My wife's flight touched down around 3 PM and by the time they got to the terminal, deplaned and got their luggage, it was 3;30 PM when I got the phone call sitting in the Cell Phone Lot. By the time I navigated out of the Cell Phone Lot which is a trick unto itself and all of the traffic in the arrival area, it was 3:45. Quick exit out of the terminal and a left onto Wilkinson Blvd and less that 15 minutes later we were in front of the restaurant.  We walked in and were promptly seated but a very courteous hostess and our server presented himself.  A little bit of history about this restaurant and the venue. People are familiar with the Jonas Bros. This restaurant is owned by their father and in turn is named after his Grandmother Nellie Jonas. Many of the recipes are her's or adaptation of her's. There is an honest attempt to present Southern Cuisine in it's purist form and they do a good job of it.  Our server as I said presented himself and took our drink orders. I ordered the traditional Southern Sweet Tea while my wife just had water. Lunch is served till 4 PM and that is the menu we were presented with and Dinner technically starts at 5 PM. Since my wife loved Meatloaf which was not on the Lunch Menu but on the Dinner Menu, my wife asked if she could order off of the Dinner Menu. The answer was a very friendly \"Sure\"  She ordered the Meatloaf off of the dinner menu which came with a choice of gravy, ketchup etc as toppings along with Green Bean Casserole  ( I hate Green Beans but that's another story) and Mashed Potatoes with Chicken Gravy..  I had the Freebird which is a Chicken Sandwich and the Chicken can be either Fried, Grilled or Blackened topped with lettuce (Romaine) tomato and onion with Ranch Dressing on a Sweet Roll and I chose Golden Fries as my side.  Place was a winner. My wife loved her Meatloaf and has proclaimed this as her new favorite restaurant. I'm not as dramatic but the Freebird was excellent and a great meal in of itself. Plain yet understated and elegant and true to it's Fried Chicken Southern heritage. When I was growing up and even into my adult years as long as my mother could cook, Sunday dinner at my mothers was always Fired Chicken and Cornbread  Our server was excellent and did a great job. Atmosphere is very modern and open with a theme revolving around birds and I'm going to guess they are doves. Band on select nights and in warmer weather, an outside dining area on the roof.  We did not worry about reservations but we arrived at an odd time. I would strongly suggest calling ahead for reservations as others have noted.  Fun place and we will definitely be back and I strongly recommend this place to anyone in the area or it you're traveling through on I-85, it;s less than 5 minutes off of the interstate."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant!!  Great atmosphere. Terrific food very fresh and tasty!! Southern it is!!! Chicken and dumplings are wonderful. Price is reasonable.  I have been here 3 times the service could use a little polishing  first time it took a long time before we were even noticed. 2 nd time I ordered food to go she said she would bring it out to me.   I waited for 40 min until I got up and asked about my order she forgot about me food was sitting on counter for 15 or 20 min so food was cold today I ate half my meal before biscuits came out and I ran out if drink while eating.  Just disappointed if service was better this would be a perfect 10 place"}
{"text":"Went in for brunch. The prices were noticeably more expensive for brunch than their dinner menu. The brunch menu doesn't have many options and only really includes breakfast items (even though we went in at 1:30). We started with the pimento cheese appetizer. The cheese was fine but the bread they gave us to dip it in was cold, hard and stale. Hard to even bite into without cutting your mouth up.  My fianc√© got the chicken and waffles and didn't even get an entire waffle. The chicken was nice & crispy but had no seasoning or flavor at all. It was cold when it came out as well. For $15 a plate plus an extra dollar for a \"deluxe side\" of mac & cheese I expect MUCH more and better quality.I got the sausage biscuit with gravy and a side of green bean casserole. I liked the biscuit, but nothing else was impressive by any means. I've also felt bloated and my stomach has been upset the rest of the day. It's currently five hours since our meal and I still feel gross. I'd been wanting to eat at Nellie's since it opened and was very very disappointed."}
{"text":"[Sigh] The Google reviews were pretty accurate. Three stars may be generous, but because I love this town three stars it is. The food was far from classic southern. Collard greens invoked my gag reflex. Sliders were biscuits. That's right. Tiny dry burgers on tiny dry biscuits. We were here 45 minutes before someone took our order. Band was awesome, whereas the servers, I'm assuming, are new to the business. Overall, just an OK place. Hoping things improve."}
{"text":"The restaurant is absolutely beautiful and is an upgraded restaurant option that Belmont desperately needed. The food was not as great though. We ordered the fried green tomatoes appetizer. The green tomatoes, which I have grown up absolutely loving, were extremely bland. Absolutely zero taste, and they were only lukewarm. For my entree I chose the vegetable plate, consisting of the green bean casserole, corn, and a salad. The green bean casserole was not my definition of a casserole, more like French green beans covered in cream of mushroom soup then warmed. I didn't love it, not the southern comfort food I had imagined beforehand. The corn was the best part of the meal, packed with flavor and the only part of my dinner that was actually hot. The salad was fresh but the ranch dressing had a very weird taste. Hopefully they just need to work out some kinks, and it will be a much better restaurant in a few months."}
{"text":"What a great night! We were there 6/9/17. Celebrating a friends birthday.  Reservations were at 8:30. Seated right on time. The food was great. Drinks were delicious.  We had the best waiter ever. Tim was so good to us. He joked, laughed, he felt like part of our group.  They had live music. I believe the name of the band was Belmont Junction. They were awesome, taking requests, doing sing alongs. I know that this is a place we will definitely be back too. Let me say one more time, our waiter Tim was the best!!!"}
{"text":"Never got a glass of water. Fried Chicken was cold, but collards were great so they get two stars not no stars. After the entrees were served we only saw our waitress  once before we gave up from thirst. Eighty dollar meal for two no way, worse restaurant experience in over a year."}
{"text":"I initially attempted to eat here last week for brunch and found out upon arrival that Nellies was closed, so I came back today for redemption.   I sat with a friend at a high top table by the bar. We had two servers take care of us. Coffee came in a giant mug, the silverware and decor was neat inside. The records and memorabilia by the restrooms/kitchen were cool and the restrooms were very clean and consistent with the rustic decor.   It took some time for our food to arrive, and my friends mug was empty for some time before our server came back to ask if she wanted a refill.   Shrimp n grits were delicious. 8 shrimp  and cheesy grits and bacon.   My friend has chicken and waffles and devoured it.   Hashbrowns were nothing to write home about, not crispy, but decent.   The owner came and cleared our plates and asked if there was anything else he could get and introduced himself. He thanked us for coming in and made a point to say thank you as we left.   Peanut butter pie for the win. It's a little difficult to eat since it's not solid, but have to cut through the crust, but oh so good."}
{"text":"First time here was amazing! My friend and me came here the day before I got married for some girl time. We sat at the rooftop bar under a shaded patio table. Our waitress was attentive and gave great service. I had a cherry sundrop drink from the bar, which was very tasty. We shared fried green tomatoes and spinach and artichoke dip for our appetizers. The dip comes with bread slices instead of chips. For my entree I had the Mac n cheese and a pulled pork sandwich. My friend also had the pulled pork sandwich with a sweet potato casserole side. All of the food was amazing! Usually I cannot eat a whole lot, but I devoured everything in sight here! Will come again!"}
{"text":"Amazing the first time. The type of amazing that you can't wait to go back. A bit pricey! But good. However... The second time was awful. I got the meatloaf both times. Second time was dry as well as my sides. My husband got the Chicken and Dumplings. Just blah. Cost too much to be \"blah\""}
{"text":"Had dinner there. Decore and overall ambience is great. The band is a little loud for dining. Service was poor especially related to ordering beer and cocktails. Waiters and waitresses should focus on service and not singing. Food is mediocre. This place has potential but needs to work out some kinks."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, average food, pleasant staff, but very disappointing service. We have been to Nellie's 4 times now as we are locals and truly want it to succeed, but I can no longer spend my time waiting for them to get the service in order. It should not take multiple hours to have a meal in a less than full restaurant. Last night I heard the expression \"I'm sorry\" from the waiter that it became a point of aggravation. Sorry, but Belmont has better options."}
{"text":"You're paying for atmosphere, live music and name. Food was OK, but a couple dollars overpriced. Worth it to buy local. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food with a wonderful local beer selection! Maggie the bartender was Awesome!  I had the fried chicken with mashed potatoes, pintos and drunken collard greens! Fantastic! Will definitely  come here again!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Nellie's and I was super excited to try the food. I hopped in the car and drove 40+ min with my friend who was also eager to go to Nellie's. We enter and the host tells us it's a 30 min wait, or we can go upstairs to their bar. So we go upstairs to their bar. We sit there for 15-20 minutes without getting greeted. We get told to have patience by what seems to be the manager so we wait a few more minutes and decide to just put our names on the wait list. After I told the hostess we weren't greeted or waited on she simply responded \"ok\" then proceeded to ask me what my name was in a very rude tone. We wait for another 10-15 minutes then finally get sat. The waiter Alex was perfect it just took 15-20 min for us to get our check... the food was pretty good but overall I don't think it made up for the experience we had.  Not to mention we had our order taken by Alex then another server came up to us and said she would be right with us because she didn't know we had already placed our food orders. They were not busy at all just very unorganized."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Server was very patient as we asked a ton of questions. Portions were awesome and make sure you save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Ok, I usually don't give a restaurant a second let alone third chance, but Nellie's is local and I have always hoped it would succeed.  And I can honestly say they have listened to the posts here and elsewhere and improved drastically! The service has become professional and timely, while the food is on point and worth ordering.  From Sunday Brunch to lunch to dinner Nellie's owners have shown they not only listen but take action and this in not just a destination restaurant for the curious any more!!   It's a place to enjoy some southern comfort food with friends."}
{"text":"Our first experience here.  Fried green tomatoes shared, close to the best I've had. Wife had fried chicken, mashed potatoes & gravy and drunk collards.  Collards were the best ever. Little biscuits were great. Beautiful place, great service. Took chocolate pecan pie and peanut butter pie to go.  Will definitely be back even though it's a 28 mile trip one-way."}
{"text":"Food was really good and people were really nice. However it too way to long for our food to come. I know it being Fathers Day but when we arrived it wasn't overly busy. That is why only 3 stars. Sorry."}
{"text":"Phew!...they finally opened!  It's great to have a locally owned restaurant that serves good food in an attractive environment.  The use of daily live music adds to the charm while the ample seating is very welcomed.  Now the constructive criticism:  the website does not do their restaurant justice & the friendly staff seemed either confused or unprepared to answer basic questions with confidence.  Despite the unseasoned staff, Nellie's is an unique option for both locales and visitors alike."}
{"text":"I love Nellie's! I love the atmosphere and how the overall place feels. It's such a good place for a family, friends night out, or date night! (Or just a meal for one) The menu is very southern, lots of good choices. The breakfast/brunch menu is also very tasty! I love the display of the Jonas Brothers/family memories, I've been a fan for over 12 years so I enjoyed that touch! This will always be my go to place when I'm feeling extra southern or just want a taste of Jonas in my life!   Well done Jonas fam! It's a lovely place!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for dinner a few weeks ago and based on the reviews I feel compelled to weigh in.   We both work in industries that deal with a lot of restaurants and knew coming in there would be some kinks needing to be worked out.   There was a band that evening (thought that was pretty cool) and although our server was hustling all over the place-the bartender came out from time to time to help out.   They were out of the fried green tomatoes, Mac and cheese, pecan crusted trout and collards-all typical issues when opening a new restaurant and not knowing what kind of volume you'll have.   With that being said, we settled on the grilled catfish, green bean casserole, salad (bacon vinegarette-omg delish) and some other items.   We thought the food was awesome and given how busy they were the service was great, too!    Overall, our experience was typical of a new restaurant and everyone should be a little more empathetic :-)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this weekend and absolutely loved!!! The decor is excellent. (Think eating dinner in a cross between a Joanna Gaines renovation and a Pottery Barn store.) The food was delicious and the service was even better. They didn't have the bottle of wine that we ordered on hand so they chose another (more expensive) bottle for us that was similar to what we ordered and gave it to us for the price of the bottle we ordered originally. Make sure to order the fried green tomatoes with goat cheese for sure! You can tell they are trying to make a great first impression on the Charlotte crowd that is most definitely commuting in to check this place out and they are doing an excellent job of that!!"}
{"text":"Love Nellies! Great food and atmosphere. The food always taste good and there live music is always fun. Really talented staff. Great place for a night out with friends or a good date night."}
{"text":"This place is so good, we came back for a second night in a row! Seriously this place is not kidding around with the southern food. I think my grandmother came out of the grave and is cooking in the back."}
{"text":"My husband and I live locally and have been wanting to try Nellies. We had our chance today for lunch and were , frankly, pretty disappointed.  There were a few good notes with a lot of negatives mixed in. The iced tea was fresh brewed with a generous lemon slice but barely any ice. We order ours unsweetened and had to get server back to the table for sweeteners. Had to stir with our knife as there were no spoons. We started with the pimento cheese appetizer. It was a generous portion but a little too heavy on the mayo for our taste. We did eat it though. The lunch menu is a little smaller than dinner but I ordered the chicken and dumplins and my husband had the barbeque sandwich with grilled veggies and slaw. The chicken and dumplins were needed a little salt and pepper and , again, we had to get the server over as there was none on the table. The barbeque was okay but the slaw had no taste. The pickle tasted like a salty cucumber. The grilled veggies were the highlight of everything we ordered.  I will say that the portions were generous . When they first turned on the music it was very loud but someone quickly turned that down. The decor is very open and the tables are not too crowded. Restaurant and bathrooms were very clean. As we were getting ready to leave I requested a to go cup fir the full glass of tea I had not been able to drink. I was told they were out of lids so they were not able to give me a cup. One last negative concerns the level of noise. The restaurant was not too crowded since we got there @ 11 so all was just your normal conversation level noise. BUT the flooring is some type of concrete or stone and the chairs are metal. Every time someone was getting seated they would pull their chair out and make a loud, horrible scraping noise. And then again as they were seated and pulled up to the table. That look seems to be very \"in\" right now but it sure is hard on the ears. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much at first considering ive never been to the town of belmont.  but when i walked through the door i was mind blown.  beautiful decorations.  The customer service is great everyone seems happy to be at work.  our server was Robin.  she was very friendly and professional.  made sure we were taken care of multiple times.  drinks stayed filled and the food came out hot and tasted amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to Nellie's twice now. The only two complaints I have are that the hostess is very rude. She has an attitude that is completely unnecessary. When we called for a reservation she said we didn't need one. We arrived 10 minutes later and she said we needed to have a reservation because there was a 30 minute wait. The catering manager, Jackie, saw that we were not happy and she seated us and let us know about the special appetizer and took our drink order. Had it not been for Jackie and her hospitality I would've given up on this place and given a completely bad review. Jackie is awesome! That hostess needs a different job...maybe in the kitchen away from the public.  Now for the food...the food is good but it's never hot. I understand cooking things to order takes longer but when it comes out it should be hot. My food was lukewarm at best. We ordered the apple pie at the end and they said that the skillet it comes in would be hot. The ice cream on top of it barely melted so it definitely was not hot. I'm not sure that I would recommend this place. The food is good, not great. The waitstaff seemed to be pushed to the max. They need more servers.  If you do go ask for Greg as your waiter and say hey to Jackie."}
{"text":"Food was decent, service was average and the outside stairs to the patio are blocked off. Live music is always good but I just didn't feel very welcome. We were also told that we cannot bring our dog on the patio. #fail #notdogfriendly"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner at Nellie's this evening. I had ketchup meatloaf with mashed potatoes and macaroni & cheese and found it all to be superb. They start you out with some smaller biscuits and butter and they were great as well.   Just before dinner was brought Mr. Jonas the owner came by our table and thanked us for coming. This certainly made an impact to me that he cared enough about us doing business with him to spend a few minutes walking to multiple tables.   It's definitely worth a trip to eat at the trendy southern kitchen."}
{"text":"It's new, so it's busy. Get there early to try to beat the crowd. We arrived about 5, and the wait for a table was 1 hour, but there was room at the bar, so no worries. Had the pulled pork with slaw side and a starter salad. Food was great, beer was cold, service excellent and live music. Loved it."}
{"text":"We happened upon his place because another was closed and we were NOT disappointed. The restaurant as soon as you walk in was just a treat for the eyes. A light piece of cotton was just amazing. We came for lunch and sat in this large booth that was comfy and great for people watching. The first thing is I loved the plates and silverware. All of it. It was fun, different and just really worked with the upscale country theme. Now.  Food. The biscuits were on point.  Great starter with real butter . We got the biscuits and gravy as an app and those biscuits were even bigger with amazing gravy. Great choice. The bf got the hamburger and mashed potatos and I got the chicken and dumplings with green bean cassorole. And all of it was perfect. Well seasoned, well cooked and absolutely satisfying for lunch. And as we walked in we saw someone walking out with banana pudding and well, we never can resist banana pudding. And we r so glad we didnt. That was the BEST banana pudding I have ever had. Perfect whipped topping, wonderful banana pudding and graham crust and mind you this entire meal was made in house. Just phenomenal.  Will be returning, we heard they had brunch on Sundays :) maybe we will sit on the rooftop next time :)"}
{"text":"Nellies is a good local restaurant! I will return to try dinner. The lunch menu was very well put together and offered just enough choices not to confuse. The food is a upscale take on southern food. I had a pimiento BLT sandwich and my wife had a local chicken sandwich. We chose 4 cheese Mac and a corn salad as our sides! The Mac was good but very runny and the corn was by far the star! Bread on the BLT could have been a little firmer as it came out on the soggy side, otherwise a great take on the classic BLT!! The decor was a little strange, lots of white birds and rabbits starring at you. The wait staff was friendly and very attentive! We will definitely return and try Sunday brunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"After a day walk at the Botanical Gardens, my brother and I decided to explore downtown Belmont and this place was highly recommended! We were pleased with the decor, atmosphere, and the menu was exactly what we were looking for! Food was tasty and fresh, and reasonably priced. The service wasn't the best but it was obvious that they were understaffed at the time. Would recommend and would come again."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here a few weeks back (sorry for delayed review). I must admit, We were both a little reluctant. To our surprise, the food was great! I was impressed with the beautiful decor and the rooftop dining  experience was wonderful. I am anxious to try Brunch! Appears the new-restaurant-bugs have been worked out and this is a great addition to Downtown Belmont!"}
{"text":"An awesome experience at Nellie's today for our first visit!  Robin, our waitress, made us feel welcomed and gave us superior service! The pimento cheese is the best I have ever tasted and I will be back for more! The fried chicken was tasty served with mashed potatoes and drunken collards.  The collards are once again the best I've ever tasted.   We will return to have dinner very soon and enjoy the roof top dinning and music. Decided to try Nellie's after seeing a food special on Charlotte Today and realized it is a quick drive from Charlotte airport.  Eating at Nellie's was a wise decision that I think anyone looking for Southern food with a twist of New South charm will not leave disappointed.  Your tastebuds will leave wanting more."}
{"text":"The collared greens are to die for, Mac and cheese is amazing, meatloaf, biscuits and  fall salad is awsome, so is the banana pudding...The food here is amazing! Let's just say all the sides are all awsome!!!"}
{"text":"I think I'm about to give birth to a food baby. I am genuinely miserable, and it hurts so good! The fella and I made Open Table reservations for 6:30 pm on a Saturday night, and it's a good thing we did because Nellie's was hoppin'. We were seated at a booth, but it seemed to primarily be tables (four-tops and community). There is a bar inside, but Nellie's seems like more of a restaurant than a place to have a drink.  Our waiter was overly enthusiastic and gave us the history of the place. His service was spot-on, and thankfully he never ditched us to go sing with the band as other reviewers have mentioned. Although, the band added a pretty awesome feel to the ambiance, which was unexpected - I'm usually not a fan of a live band at dinner, but they played some great, crowd-pleasing songs and weren't too loud.  Onto the best part! We started with the pimento appetizer, which I piled onto the toast points. They also bring complimentary biscuits, which were small, buttery, and dense. Then we moved onto dinner - I got the meatloaf with ketchup, which was DIVINE, and came with green bean casserole and mashed potatoes. The potatoes were a little bland, so I skipped them and went for the casserole, which was creamy. The fella got the salt and pepper catfish (fried), and he said it wasn't too salty or peppery - not like fish camp catfish - but he loved it, and he especially loved the fact that it was a heaping portion and boneless. The collards that came with it had been overly drowned in vinegar, so he had to skip those, but the corn was a standout. We ended with banana pudding, which came in a mason jar. Banana pudding is my favorite dessert of all-time, and theirs was delicious, although it's pretty hard to mess up banana pudding.  We've already made reservations to take my parents when they visit in a few weeks, and we've already starting talking about what we'll get that time. Nellie's is definitely worth the drive from Charlotte... or just about anywhere else."}
{"text":"So I gave it 3 stars because the food and management were just ok. My server was Nicole and she was great, I would have given her alone 5 stars, but it's based on everything. No one seemed to know what was going on in the kitchen, our food took forever. . I was told 10 minute wait and it was almost 40. I will go back because my server my server was awesome, so she won this place a second chance!!!!"}
{"text":"I've now given this place 5 times to wow me. It takes forever for the food to arrive. The decor is nice and the staff is friendly but too often you have to ask for refills and the sweet tea is gross. You shouldn't be allowed to have southern in your name if your tea isn't delicious! The food is great most of the time it just takes forever!"}
{"text":"I keep wanting this place to succeed.  The buzz around town with the locals is that we ...  well.... just don't.  Belmont has some really great restaurants which makes Nellie's all the more disappointing.    Like I said before, I REALLY want to like this place.  I've been back like 4 or 5 times over the last 7 months and each time it feels like it gets worse.  Stopped in one Friday morning before work to try the \"Pick Me up\". My thought was that it couldn't possibly take that long to get a breakfast sandwich and a latte.  Alas, I was wrong.  20 mins later I had finished my latte and was still waiting on the kitchen.  it's a good thing I didn't have to be at work early that morning.  Oh, and there was no one else in the place at the time.    My harsh, but very real advice to the Jonas' is this:  You need to fix the problems with the quality and service before you go promoting your restaurant with reality TV shows and media spots.  The food is inconsistent, often burned or half raw.  The service is curt and rarely delivered with a smile.  The wait times are extraordinary, and it seems like even the smallest crowd gets the kitchen in the weeds.    Belmont was very excited about this opening last summer, but I can tell you that the folks who are coming to your restaurant now are not the locals.  Nellie's is little more than a tourist trap in its current incarnation, and that can only last for so long.  I get that the family is not dependent on this business for an income, and it shows.  But as someone who grew up in the industry, I must tell you that there isn't a chef or restaurateur out there that wouldn't give their right arm to have this kind of opportunity.  Refusing to take and learn from the feedback you're receiving is a) arrogant and b) a slap in the face to all of those chefs would love to have what you have here.  Shape up guys.  Hire a management consultant.  Bring in an expert.  It's not like you can't afford it.  But don't continue to be the butt of the culinary joke."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went for lunch today.  Had a reservation, so we were seated as soon as we arrived.  Server came over and spoke to us a bit and took our drink orders. I ordered a Bloody Mary.  Hubby had water.  She also explained that each meal was prepared at the time of order, so it might take a little extra time in preparing. We both ordered Shrimp & Grits, and a side of Mac & Cheese.  Within a minute, out comes our entrees!  Very surprised as I didn't even get my Bloody Mary yet. So....the grits looked as though they were pre-made and put on the plate, and the shrimp was added afterward.  It was very gummy and clumped together.  Still no Bloody Mary....and no Mac & Cheese yet.  Had to get servers attention for salt & pepper (was paying attention to other table who had a birthday in their party). Had to ask for my drink again and remind her about Mac & Cheese.   Very disappointed....probably won't go back.    PS  asked server if they had password for wifi which clearly came up on my phone.  She said didn't think it was for the customer.  Shame."}
{"text":"Classic southern charm in a quaint historic mill town, Nellies doesn't disappoint. Prompt attentive service coupled with some of the best fried chicken in the area makes this place a standout. Small twists on classic southern dishes like pecan crusted fried green tomatoes and crunchy top 4 cheese Mac & cheese served in cast iron seem to work. Wife claims they have the best chicken and dumplings, which after a small sample is hard to dispute.   Shiplap and reclaimed wood walls, funky chandeliers, a large portrait of Nellie with her chicken, banjo, cast iron pan and dachshund adorns the back wall along with numerous pictures and awards of the Jonas brothers in the hall sums up the ambiance.   We'll be back."}
{"text":"I've tried and tried to give this place a shot, but they keep  finding ways to screw it up. This time? On top of not having their signature dish, fried chicken, and on top of meatloaf that could most charitably be described as meat-flavored dry wall, we had to endure not having any dishes cleared, and ultimately she PILED THEM ALL ON THE TABLE. No more. No more..."}
{"text":"Our first time to Nellie's and was very pleased with the service, friendliness of staff and the food was delicious. When the owner stops by your table is always a plus and to learn he is the father of the famous Jonas Brothers! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So after finally being able to get a seat at this obviously popular restaurant I got to experience what the \"talk\" of the town has been about Nelly's. I sat at the bar and waited for a few minutes. Neither of the bartenders came to ask me what I'd like. I had to eventually get the bar back to get my drink order. I then had to ask for a menu. Shortly after I had to ask the bartender/server that I was ready to order. I ordered the summer side salad with the Cajun trout. I didn't get my salad and was about to ask when all of my food came at one time. I asked if that was normal, and the lady said she wondered the same thing and walked away. My food was good. Which would be the only reason to return to this location. I'd hope that in the future that the staff would adjust to a busy restaurant, clean up there bar area so it wasn't so messy and take full advantage of people wanting to come into a new place in Belmont! Good luck!"}
{"text":"As an avid Jonas fan, this restaurant has been on my radar for a while. I was finally able to go in with my best friend tonight and I have to say that it was amazing- and I'm not just saying this because I'm a fan. The restaurant itself is beautiful, and there is a lot of culture within those walls. There are paintings of the family and my favorite, a Jonas Brothers wall. All of the recipes are from their Grandmother- real, authentic Southern cooking. I had the chicken and dumplings and I couldn't stop raving about how good they were. I'm picky when it comes to Southern food- nobody does it like my mama- but somehow this was the first time anything has been able to compete. My friend got the meatloaf and she really enjoyed that as well.  Our waitress was Kim, and she was the absolute sweetest! She was very attentive, made good conversation with us, and made sure that all of our needs were met. In fact, all of the wait staff looked to be busy, even though we were early and the restaurant hadn't begun to fill up yet. They were really trying to keep everything nice for the guests who were there.  I wasn't expecting for Mr. Jonas to be at the restaurant, and I fangirled when he came in. Kim asked if I wanted to meet him and he personally came out to the table, shook our hands, spoke with us, and took a picture with me. He was so kind to us- genuinely kind. After taking his time with us, he walked around to the other tables as well.  I'm not sure why Nellie's is getting bad reviews, because I didn't have any of the experiences that past guests have had. I know they look at these reviews, and they are really trying to improve. I think that they are doing a wonderful job, and I'm already planning to come back on my birthday in April!"}
{"text":"The manager contacted me about my first review and I must say this time I brought my mom who was visiting from out of town and had an amazing experience! I had the fried chicken which I never order and I am sooooo happy I did. I'm addicted . Great atmosphere on the roof top and the service was on point ! See you soon Nellies !"}
{"text":"Great spot in the city center. Love the style and we got a great spot in the back right corner table. You have to check out the rooftop view.  We got a little of everything. And it was all wonderful! It felt like you just had some of Nana's cooking. COMFORT FOOD!!!  I had the biscuits and gravy with an over easy egg and asked for some Tabasco and they gave me some of their homemade hot sauce! I wish they sold that in the stores! It was the best I've ever had!   The French toast was amazingly sweet with nice slices of cinnamon apples! The chicken dumplings  were tasty and I loved the bit of my wife's chicken & waffles with the HONEY BUTTER! Just wow!  I saw the meatloaf and wanted some of that! Next time.  The banana pudding was great and loved that it came in a mason jar. (The silverware was really cool btw)  Carrot cake had a healthy layer of icing that I loved.  It was worth the long drive! Just come early because it's always busy."}
{"text":"It's difficult to describe how disappointing this place is. When we first arrived, the restaurant was pretty dead. There was only one other party, but we realized that we came in between the lunch and dinner hours. Knowing that we came at a slow time, one would expect everything to be flawless.  But it wasn't. Our friends ordered draft beers, which were served in warm glasses that had just been taken out of the dishwasher. Our server rushed us through the ordering process and was pretty annoyed that we hadn't made up our minds on entrees when we had just ordered an appetizer. In doing so, our server failed to place our appetizer in with the kitchen. When our appetizer didn't show up in a timely fashion, we noticed at the bottom of the menu that mini biscuits were available upon request. I truly don't understand why this is in small print at the bottom of the menu, and isn't just standard fair like other restaurants? These were brought out fairly quickly.   The entrees were all edible but they were not good. It's almost like they were thrown together with no thought or care. Two of us had the fried catfish, which had zero seasoning in the batter, one had the chicken and dumplings, which was also lacking in flavor, and I had the shrimp and grits.  Whatever you do, do NOT order the shrimp and grits! The grits were undercooked, and the shrimp was served tail on which is not ideal for this dish. The flavor, just like the other entrees was also off.   This place is, sadly, a one and done kind of restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful the service was wonderful I will definitely be going back!! And the live music was fun and exciting for the whole family!!!! I add happy that Belmont has such an awesome place to eat or call in and make it to go order and come pick it up!! It's such a convenient place to dine in or carryout I absolutely love it"}
{"text":"Wonderful place for gathering for a delicious homestyle meal . Comfort food. Super charming decor and ambience. Live music . Delicious food and beverages. Town of Belmont NC has a park up the street with Veterans Memorial flags and a Soldier statue , a new Play Structure.Fountain.  Added photos"}
{"text":"Always fantastic!!! Best meat loaf anywhere. Great drinks. Great music.  Staff so friendly.   This place gets better every time I go."}
{"text":"My first visit, only had time to stop for a glass of wine and an appetizer. The design and decor is very appealing, light fixtures, tables, bar all inviting when you come in the door. Hostess was welcoming and accommodating. I chose to sit at the bar, it was a Tuesday afternoon and after the lunch hour. When the bartender finally appeared and I ordered a glass of wine, she could not open the bottle because she could not find a corkscrew. Several minutes pass and she offers me a glass of water, no efforts seem to be directed to procuring a corkscrew. Finally a glass of wine is delivered. The appetizer was dry and did not live up to the description. When I asked for a napkin, I was handed a couple of bar napkins. Eventually I was provided with a regular napkin.   Given this small \"taste\" of the restaurant and the type of service, not sure if I will go back for a full meal. And, now having read some of the reviews my experience may be pretty typical. TOO BAD, great attributes but service seems to be an issue."}
{"text":"We stopped in on our way to Asheville and never expected to find such friendliness, warmth, and delicious food in an altogether charming setting. Truly outstanding; worth a special trip to taste this extraordinary example of Southern hospitality. Unfortunately we didn't have time to stay for the live show but we'll make a point of it next time we are in North Carolina."}
{"text":"The BEST chicken and waffles I have EVER had in my life!!!!!!   I live in Augusta Georgia but went up there to check out my sisters wedding venue. She is having her rehearsal brunch at Nellies so I wanted to try it out. The decor was so beautiful, and the chairs didn't look like they would be comfy but there were!   I have tried chicken and waffles at almost every restaurant possible and they always disappoint.... but not here! That fried chicken was amazing.   My sister got the meatloaf and we were both disappointed in it but they didn't hesitate to exchange it for chicken.   Overall excited to go back in May!"}
{"text":"This was absolutely the BEST southern cuisine I've ever had. EVERYTHING I had was delicious. Luckily I went with a large group so I was able to sample many dishes. I ordered the shrimp & grits which was so flavorful and delicious. I tried their four cheese mac & cheese and had to pause to savor the taste in between bites. I also ordered the fried green tomatoes appetizer and was simply blown away. The owner, Mr Jonas insisted we all try the chicken & dumplings and though my belly was 80% full already, I obliged and am so grateful I did. Amazing!! The gravy base the chicken and dumplings are in is literally, finger licking good. I'm leaving happy and stuffed but I was smart enough to get an order of their famous banana pudding to go. My girlfriend let me taste hers and I had to get some of my own. I'm coming back very soon. Delicious! Delicious, Delicious! Not to mention the owners and staff are so warm and extremely hospital! I recommend this restaurant to everyone who loves great food & exceptional service"}
{"text":"The absolute best meal I have had in a very long time. The chicken breast was crunchy outside and juicy inside with the perfect seasoning. Mashed potatoes with white gravy were a great pairing. Tried my husbands sweet potato casserole was moist and full of pecans. But, the BEST part was the 4 cheese Mac and cheese....out of this world!!!! The only negative was the service. We got our drinks quickly, took a long time to get waitress to take our food order. Once we placed our order, our food came quickly. In their defense, it was a busy Friday night and we did not have reservations. Won't stop me from going again. The live music was good....a mix of styles, at the right volume. Highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good food!"}
{"text":"Boy oh boy.  This is definitely not my idea of Southern food.  I'm from the Charlotte, grew up on Southern cooking and am kind of confused as to how this restaurant is marketing itself.    My fried chicken was dry, the skin was gummy and the chicken dumplings was nothing to be desired.  It was like water, flour and chicken, no veggies.    Sorry folks, not going back for a repeat."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but service was terrible. Waited forever for our meals and never got our appetizer until we asked for it again. The best part of this place is the live music, and chance to see the \"Bonus Jonas\" family members as we like to call them."}
{"text":"We stopped here before our trip to the arboretum. What a surprise! Belmont is so cute and people are amazing. We sat on the rooftop overlooking the town. Try and bloody Mary's and green tomatoes. If we lived here this would be a staple for us. John is the best!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is lovely and you'll pay for it.  Came by right at opening time on a Sunday, they were not prepared. We were the only ones here - We chose the rooftop seating. Very limited selection for breakfast. We both chose eggs, side meat, potatoes and a small dish of fruit. Bacon was over cooked, potatoes were simply salted, two eggs for $11 !!! We've eaten double the tastier more creative food for the price within 5 miles."}
{"text":"Went to Nell's in Belmont for the 1st time today (10/22/16). Was not impressed with the service. After being seated, with no menus, we waited 10 minutes and the bartender came over to take our orders. I have to point out that there was plenty of help just standing around. The pulled pork was good along with the chicken and dumplings. It will be awhile before I go back."}
{"text":"Phone call earlier in the day: We'd like to make a reservation?  \"I'm sorry but we don't have any for about a week - we do have tables for walk-ins - we've not had any problems - the wait is only about 20 minutes\"  Arrival at restaurant - there are people to the left waiting, looking exhausted and with forlorn. The entry way is packed.  The bar area is packed. There are three people at the hostess stand with their backs to all of these people; I assume trying to come up with a game plan. They stay like that for two minutes. A young blonde asks how many. (Two). Her response is one hour to one hour and twenty minutes. (Wow!) Her second response - \"I know , right?!\" - What was probably meant as empathy came across as \"Even I think this is ridiculous - where did all these people come from and why are they waiting so long to eat here?\". Third response - there is some seating on the roof is you want to try there.  I trek to the roof - where there is one table baking in the sun. I call to my mother to come up the massive staircase. A waitress drops an entire tray of glasses. BTW there are only two umbrellas for all of the tables up here. We sit there for five minutes, sweating and waiting for a waitress. No one comes. The heat on this patio is unbearable. We leave.  **this review is obviously based on my experience with interactions and lack of interactions with staff members*** I will also obviously update my review once I have actually eaten there***reading other reviews, it sounds like they really have some kinks to work out  The moral of the story is - 1) don't believe everything a hostess tells you over the phone 2) make a reservation if you want to eat here and just wait it out 3) the patio is way too hot and need more umbrellas and some fans/misters  The String Bean seated us right away and our meal was awesome...."}
{"text":"Overblown, over hyped, and over priced. I've had to go here a few times for business dinners and have been singularly unimpressed each time. Mediocrity, thy name is Nellies."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday right at lunch hour. There was a good crowd, but we were seated right away (and we got a booth - yahtzee!). Our waitress, Marissa, was a sweetheart. The ambiance in here is great and even with a lot of people, it doesn't get loud. Not sure if hat has to do with the high ceilings but we noticed all of the chatter and sounds were drowned out. The food was delicious. Some of the best chicken and dumplings I've had. And the green bean casserole ... heavenly. Reminded me of my grandma's. The hoagie for the po' boy had a lot of bread. Husband wished there was a better ratio of filling to bread. The biscuits are some of my favorite ever. One weird thing ... we asked for jelly with our biscuits, but when Marissa came back to our table she said they were out of jelly. How do you run out of that? Seems silly. Otherwise, everything was great. We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. So very very much. The food is always amazing. The service is great.   But to close early on Sundays in 2018 is an awful thing."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and sat on the rooftop. The restaurant itself looked really nice, and sitting out on the rooftop was pleasant. However, after ordering our food which consisted of an appetizer and a cold sandwich we sat for the next 35 minutes waiting for our lunch. Which never materialized. So since my lunch hour was almost over we got up and left without Getting to eat. On the way out I let the hostess know and all we got was \"I'm so sorry\".  Not great service at all, very disappointed. Will not be going back even if the food is awesome."}
{"text":"I just went for Brunch and I was at the roof top. I had to wait 2 1/2 hours for a Chicken and dumplings. When the waiter was serving it, my plate was dripping on the sides and they didn't ever care. All super inexperienced young kids. They didn't look worried for our wait. They were just fine with the mediocre service. So sad because the place is nice and the food is not bad. We even had to wait for the drinks....."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Nellies and was sadly very disappointed. My salad was rotten. The Mac n chz had burnt ham in it which ruined the whole dish. The green beans were not cooked in the green bean casserole. The biscuits were stale and tasted horrible. Prices do not reflect quality. The staff is obviously more trained to sing than serve. Everything was a bust besides the beautiful atmosphere."}
{"text":"I want to like this place. I really do. The first trip there was great. Highly recommend the meatloaf and green bean casserole. I think that was a Sunday brunch special. Our next two trips have been terrible, though. Bad service, slow slow food arrival. One day we were almost the first people there for an early Saturday lunch and food took forever. We ordered the pimento cheese appetizer, which came with four toast points. Four. We had to ask for more just to enjoy the pimento cheese. At our last visit, our waitress obviously had too much to handle, while two hostesses held up the front desk. No idea why they weren't helping refill drinks or doing more to help run food. I got steak and eggs. My food was cold, as eggs, grits, and hash browns will do when not delivered promptly. No idea where the bacon was even though I ordered it. The steak was over cooked, and I couldn't finish it. So I paid $17 for cold breakfast food and a terrible steak. I can make eggs, grits and hash browns at home for $5. And eat it hot. Please resolve your service and food delivery issues."}
{"text":"Good food.  Not a fan of their waffles.  Stick to the biscuits and gravy.  Beer selection not great.  Did enjoy the live music"}
{"text":"Such a fun and unique experience here. Their chicken and dumplings, meatloaf, green bean casserole and desserts are some of THE best I have ever had. Their waitstaff is super professional and attentive and and the live music is better than a show you'd have to pay a cover to see at most places. You can tell there are still some kinks being worked out, but what an amazing start to the business! We can't wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"This is new restaurant and the fact that it has ties with celebrities (Jonas Bros) will help it get started which isn't easy for any restaurant. Menu was pretty basic and straight forward with understandable lean towards country flair. Had the roasted chicken with 4 cheese macaroni. My portion of chicken was small but I will say this, it was extremely full of flavor.  Wife had chicken with dumplings which she said was very good. Deserts where limited but we tried the turtle brownie which was tasty but needed a just a little bit of something else, maybe a separate container of chocolate or whipped cream or even have an option for ice cream. Overall,  we'd go back.  Oh we also noticed a band set up, no band was playing but could be a nice touch depending on volume. Room could get extremely noisy at the wrong level."}
{"text":"Good place to go if your hungry. But the times I have gone, the music was too loud and you couldn't hear the person talking next to you"}
{"text":"We had such a great time at Nellie's  last night! Wonderful food, fabulous service, welcoming relaxed environment, awesome entertainment and music! We will definitely be back! No doubt!"}
{"text":"My first time here and boy have I been missing out on a treasure.   The chicken and dumplings were just like my mom's growing up.   The fried green tomatoes were incredible. Must have!   Everything on the menu sounds so amazing it's hard to decide. I must rave about the atmosphere and staff!  Decor is amazing!   I didn't want to leave!   Our waitress was warm and inviting and knowledgeable of the menu.  So very patient and attentive as we stayed and chatted.  We met Denise and Kevin in the parking lot and they were wonderful and truly cared about our feedback on our experience.  We will be back.  My new favorite place in the area."}
{"text":"I want to give this more . Probably 3.5. The place is gorgeous. There is rooftop dining which is dog friendly. There is music at 6 pm. The decor is stunning.  However, the food was sub par. My salad had some wilt to it. The flank steak I ordered as a topping was cooked well done, almost leathery and was perhaps marinated. I don't know, it was unlike any flank steak I've had . Little thin curled almost black strips of meat. My daughters mac and cheese came in a cute souffl√© dish, there was crust on top which I like but she does not. However, the noodles were dry and not creamy inside the dish at all. She enjoyed her BBQ, I thought it was like cardboard. Our fried green tomatoes, were good . That's a nice side . However , they were fried to a very dark brown, almost like the oil needed changing. Because they were sliced So thin, there was hardly any tomato inside to enjoy. We were offered some bisquits and butter and they were OUTStanding!   I'd come back probably, try something else, just to enjoy the atmosphere with friends.  Update, management has contacted me and appreciate my comments. Honestly , the place is gorgeous.   I feel Certain improvements can be made easily!"}
{"text":"I could start this off by talking about the decor, but who cares when the food good. We walked into the restaurant and we were seated immediately. A waitress came right over to get our drink orders. After our drinks arrived, we ordered our meals. The kitchen was slow but I chalk that up to it being the day after Christmas and they seemed a little short on staff. I assume management didn't imagine it would be as busy as it turned out to be. 30 minutes later our food arrived and everything was delicious! The fried chicken/chicken tenders were perfect. The creamed corn was fresh...the corn had a bit of a crunch and exceeded my expectations. Mashed potatoes, fries, collards, macaroni + cheese...oh my gosh! WORTH THE WAIT! Next time I want to come for dinner and check out the live music."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding and our server, Robyn, was even better. Super festive and loved her Southern Charm."}
{"text":"After reading numerous reviews, I was skeptical about visiting, but since I am a loyal Jonas Brothers fan, I went anyways. We made reservations for 8 and arrived early. The atmosphere is very comfortable and there was a live band playing the whole time. We waited but at 8 we were immediately seated. The waitress appeared promptly for drink and appetizer orders. We ordered cocktails which took a good deal of time to come out. The appetizer came and we placed our dinner order which came out super fast to our surprise! A few minutes into eating our cocktails came. The food was amazing. We were stuffed and still ordered the chocolate mousse cake and ate every bite. I wouldn't eat here everyday, but I definitely plan to return.  Ps. Kevin Jonas Sr. is amazing and so nice. I look forward to meeting more of the family"}
{"text":"Loved this place and have been back several time. The pimento cheese with crispy bread was just amazing. I could have eaten that for my meal. It was that good. I also had their fried chicken. It was dipped in something sweet. I have no idea what it was dipped in but it was delicious and came served with homemade jam with a kick to it. We also had biscuits and jam as well. And if that wasn't enough, I also got the chicken and waffles. Delicious. I will continue to return. Loved it."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try the Rivermen beer.  The DJ's Pale Ale was delicious.  Apart from that, I'm a lifelong fan of biscuits and wasn't disappointed.  Unlike Cracker Barrel, they continue serving biscuits for the table.  Although I haven't tried much else besides the chicken and dumplings, I didn't want to because they were so delicious.  Don't leave without trying the carrot cake."}
{"text":"Great Southern Fare at reasonable prices.. This place has an amazing atmosphere & excellent staff w/nightly live music..."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the ambiance is great. Beyond those two things, this place needs a lot of work.  Our large party had 7:30 reservations. We didn't get seated until around 8:10. We had children with us, so these issues were amplified since they were all up way too late.   We were seated in a back room, which I believe is why we we had such bad service. The server (who was very nice, but obviously too busy) brought our menus, and then came back over 10 minutes later to take only the drink orders. After waiting far too long, we had to track someone down to come take our actual food order. They forgot to bring the bread that we requested, since we had been waiting for so long. I needed another drink, but with how slow the wait staff had been, I figured I'd get better results going up to the bar. After being acknowledged and told the bartender would be with me next, she proceeded to make a couple of lengthy drink orders from some of her tables. There were multiple bar backs, but only seemed to be the one actual bartender. I waited a bit longer, before giving up and going back to our table. After our meal was over, we were told that we would be getting free dessert for our trouble. Don't get me wrong, that's a nice gesture, but when we were upset for the extremely long wait times, why would we want to be there longer waiting on dessert? In my opinion, places should comp meals or drinks, not give free dessert. I can't even remember when we finally left the restaurant but I think it was almost 10:00."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the ambience right off the bat! We came in very early on a Tuesday. It was freezing outside but the restaurant was warm and cozy. It also didn't take long for patrons to roll in. Our server Robin was very  attentive and friendly we told her we had never been in before she told us about the menu and each got one of her recommendations. I got the shrimp and grits which were great and my daughter got a burger, also delicious (grilled bun 3 types of beef=yum). The food was prepared perfectly and came out in a timely manner! Robin also brought some biscuits strait from the oven for us to try. They melted in your mouth. We enjoyed the music playing in the background but they have Live music Wednesday-Saturday nights and Sunday brunch. We will be back to see the house band for sure!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the positive. Mom always said, don't say nothin' if you don't have nothin' nice to say, after all. This is one of the most beautiful, tastefully decorated restaurants I've ever had the pleasure of visiting. I loved the light fixtures, especially the big cotton one above the bar and the bird chandeliers. The tables and chairs are gorgeous in whites and silvers. Even the cutlery is a unique design and color. And, they have what might be the coolest patio in the Southeast, upstairs and kinda caddy-corner to the restaurant, overlooking downtown Belmont.   There! Now that I've listed the positives, I feel better about what I'm going to say next... The food is really nothing special. From the menu's descriptions, we were excited! Sweet potato fries with maple honey butter, drunken collards, Sunday meatloaf... Oh, my! But in real life, everything fell flat. The pimento app was almost watery, definitely bland and the toast points were way too hard. The sweet potato fries desperately needed salt, as did my entree, the skirt steak. Others at the table ordered the meatloaf (ironically, that was way too salty - I blame the gravy) and fried chicken. All around, nothing knock-your-socks-off.   Service was hit or miss. We tried to flag our waiter down for 10+ minutes to order a beer when we first arrived to no avail. Oh! And, they were out of the beer I ordered but it took them another 10+ minutes to tell me that. Wait staff kept hopping on stage to sing, which was quirky and charming at first, until our waiter was up there singing while we were waiting for him to run our cards. The live music also made it pretty hard to talk with our friends and family.   All in all, Nellie's is fine. We didn't have anything bad, per say. I just wish their food and service lived up to the atmosphere they set with the beautiful decor."}
{"text":"Food was under cooked and tasteless.. Pimento was great.. were clean and nice staff.. will come back but will stick to drinks and pimento cheese"}
{"text":"Updating my review, Nellie's food has gone from horrible to OK, service here is still inconsistent at best and apathetic at worst.  So kudos for fixing the kitchen now get the from end fixed and consistent and the only downside to being a regular is the limited menu."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and our waitress, Emily, did an amazing job of serving 26 people with grace and skill and didn't get a single order wrong!!!!"}
{"text":"All the food was cold, no Bloody Mary mix, Mac and cheese was nasty, server was annoyed by us asking to take the app plates away. Meatloaf was hard and cold. Theme here is cold. Restaurant atmosphere was nice, bathrooms clean."}
{"text":"Met a friend for dinner 5 pm. Service was friendly, decor interesting, food mostly good. I enjoyed the salad of half a head of romaine with blue cheese and fried chicken. My friend liked the slaw and the Mac and cheese. Nether of us cared for the collards-too bitter. The Windy a hill cider was awesome, and I'm impressed that they had it on tap. But the reason I give four stars and not five is that midway through our dinner the live band started up and we could no longer hear each other. Finally we accepted the manager's offer to move to the back room, which was MUCH quieter. The owner came over to talk with us and was interested in what we had to say. He gave us dessert; the chocolate bourbon pecan pie was excellent and my friend enjoyed the pineapple upside down cake. We will come again, but only if we can sit in the back or at a table to the side of the bar as far from the band as possible. I'm a fan of live music, but not when I'm trying to have a conversation over dinner."}
{"text":"Went to nellies with some friends who live in the area, everything was great. Only thing missing was live music !!! Food was fantastic, our waitress Maggie was amazing offering great suggestions and serving great food!!! The apps were so good !!! Fried green tomatoes , biscuits and gravy and those amazing fried chicken with captain crunch cereal on the coating , you should bottle the sauce with those!!!! Had great catfish dinner with wonderfully tasting sides, collards and Mac and cheese !!! Finished with banana pudding!!! Couldn't go wrong with any of these choices !!! Thanks to Maggie for her great laughter and service!!! Thanks to the bartender for making us a maple old fashioned , off the menu , great nite !!!!"}
{"text":"To keep it simple- the food and ambiance is amazing however the waiters/waitresses are underwhelming when it comes to service. Luckily the afternoon music kept my party entertained, otherwise we would have somewhat disappointed."}
{"text":"Great experience! The fall salad and vegetables are wonderful, as well as all the other sides and dessert. The service and wonderful band made the experience even more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"First time, not last. Excellent southern fare, including biscuits, catfish, fried chicken, vegetables and banana pudding. Super service too. Quaint, comfortable atmosphere. Great menu, so we can't wait to come back and try other things!"}
{"text":"I was there the other day and just came to the bar after a long day of work. The bartender Graham was extremely kind, considerate, and very relatable. I had the expectation that I would be there for 30 minutes tops but then ended up staying for 3 hours because I enjoyed his company. In addition, the drinks were delicious especially the cherry lemon sundrop."}
{"text":"I've only come to Nellie's twice, however neither visit has been a disappointment! Their food is nothing short of amazing! In March I decided to try their chicken & waffles entree and that will 100% be my go-to order every visit from now on! The waffles were cornbread but had a sweet honey butter and syrup to go with them - and don't get me started on the chicken! It was a boneless breast as big as my waffle and fried to perfection! Nellie's is definitely worth my hour drive! (Getting to meet Mama Jonas was of course a plus as well!)"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere! I'm usually not a huge fan of live music but it was great here. It's especially cool that the waiters get a chance to sing and perform. The restaurant is decorated gorgeous with lots of quirky Southern touches.   My friends and I split the gin cocktail pitcher (I forget what it was called). It was really yummy, especially considering that none of us like gin.   As for the food, I was semi impressed. My two friends got the grouper and it was a huge serving. Very tasty. I got the catfish, which was cooked excellently, but literally the tiniest serving ever. It look like two shrimpy chicken fingers when she brought it out to me--my friends thought it was a mistake at first. That was really disappointing, considering how large the portions were for every other entree. The sides were yummy and large. I was a bit disappointed with the cheese grits cause they were cold. Oh, and the biscuits they bring you before your meal are so good!  The staff was friendly but clearly overwhelmed, haha. I gave them some grace some it was their opening week. Food took forever though.   I would definitely go back but wouldn't get the catfish. $15 is ridiculous for that portion size."}
{"text":"Tried this for lunch with some coworkers. It's just nothing great. The decor is really nice and I liked the atmosphere but the food was only okay, definitely not worth the price. The biscuits they bring you before your meal are really good. I had the grilled chicken sandwich with the mac and cheese. The bread on the sandwich was awful. A couple of us didn't eat our bread. The mac and cheese was good but way too much breading. Overall I doubt I would go back, just wasn't worth the price."}
{"text":"Cool building. We sat in the roof. Had the pimento cheese app which was tasty. The Bloody Mary was good and spicy but not too spicy. I had the chicken fried steak. It was good not great. Husband had the Three Pigs biscuit with Mac and cheese and that was super amazing.  Our friend got the chicken and dumplings which was more like chicken and pastry and that was very good and our other friend got the chicken and waffles and said it was good. The Jonas shrine in the bathroom hallway was a little creepy and confusing but apparently the owners are maybe kin? Anyway. Very clean and worth coming back to. The rooftop bar was super nice."}
{"text":"Let me say I think we were just very unlucky today. Stopped by Nellie's after a long hike at Crowder's Mountain. Two of us, arrived just after 2 on a Saturday. Quickly got a table. Loved the decor and the vibe of the place.   Ordered waters and an appetizer. Ordered the crunchy chicken fingers but they were out of them. So went with the Pimento cheese and it was very good. It came out instantly. Lots of flavor, chunks of cheddar. Ordered our entrees soon after. Finished my water, server apologized she was busy, had a group of 20 in the back. Told her no worries. Another server brought more toast for the very large portion of pimento cheese, great service by her. Waited about 30 minutes, saw others who were in after us get their meals. Caught the waitress, ordered chicken and dumplings and mac and cheese to go for my daughter back home. 15 minutes later the to go order comes out. Wait, what? We don't have our entrees yet.   Our food was then brought out by someone else not long after. Pimento Bacon Cheese Burger. Bacon was super crunchy and the sweet potato waffle fries were crisp but cold and crunchy. My chicken and waffles. Chicken was very good. Not hot, not cold. Waffle was cold. Server finally came back by and asked about dessert. Said no. Asked for the check. She asked if we needed a box and we told her no because the to go food came out first and our food was cold like it had been sitting around. Ate the burger minus the bacon and the chicken but not much else. I thought she might have mentioned that to a manager but didn't. Wasn't interested in making it right. Always struggle with the tip there. Gave her 15% on the non-take out because she was probably just in a bad spot with that big group I guess.   Drove back to Charlotte with the to-go food and my daughter loved it. I though it was delish and it was warmer than our food even after a 30 minute drive. This raised it up to a 2. Honestly I bet the food is 4-5 as long you get the right service.   Maybe we should have just done take out??????"}
{"text":"My family loved our lunch an a beautiful afternoon on the roof top porch  The service was quick to seating and water. They brought my dog a nice big bowl too and a couple dog treats. What a nice touch There were plenty of choices on the menu, kids favorites and some good sounding bar drinks  Salads, burgers, pork, shrimp and grits, fried chicken  We started with the fried green tomatoes. It was delicious and plenty for two to share. Even the kids loved liked it The kids had macaroni and cheese, burger and fruit   Very happy The adults opted for salads with added shrimp  They were fresh, big and good dressings  Lots of shrimp. Neither of us finished  The staff was friendly and helpful  We all loved it and want to return  My dog enjoyed the attention too Plenty of shade, drinks and I loved that it wasn't too noisy to talk"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice. However I really wasn't impressed with the food. The chicken and dumplings were mushy, Nanas corn was runny and had no flavor, mashed potatoes were brown in color with barely any flavor and the coleslaw was just awful. I will go back just to try other things, but last night, the food was not good. #disappointedinsouthernfood"}
{"text":"Waited 25 min for a seat no problem. Waited 30 min for a scoop of pimento no problem. Been waiting 46 minutes after the app still no food and a angry child. I had to leave and trust me I'm a very patient guy. Headed to Sammie's. But the biscuits were good. Have some time on your hands."}
{"text":"Unfortunately after 2 tries, Nellie's just doesn't work.  We've tried multiple menu items, all were poor!  Service has always been fair, at best.  Last straw was a typical Thursday afterwork dinner. We arrived around 630pm and were quickly seated.  The good news ends there. I was a bit nervous after only seeing 4 or 5 other tables full. It is early though.  I ordered the daily special, a pork chop.  After ordering the waiter returned to tell me they were out of pork chops.  I asked for another dish, only to find that they were out of that as well.  So I had the chicken fried steak.  Gross.  My wife had pulled pork.  Bad.  Hers tasted like someone had dropped a salt shaker in with the pig.    I'm sorry to say that the Jonas brothers should stay in the music business, because they really don't know how to cook.   The band was good though!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dinner tonight at Nellies Southern Kitchen. Our waitress, Kayla, was great and very enthusiastic. I have food allergies and the chef came out to our table to discuss this with me prior to ordering. I found this to be very comforting, as many restaurants do not do this. The owner, Kevin Jonas also stopped by our table to check on the service and food. We had the meatloaf, collard greens and Mac and cheese. All of which was very good. Great new option for dinner. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This was the third time I've eaten at Nellie's and the last ,over a year ago I chalked up the bad service and medioker food as being new, but last night had the chicken and dumplings was the blandest most unattractive plate of food sat in front of me ever .I would have been embarrassed if I were the waitress to put that plate down in front of a customer, bland & tasteless  and so very dissapointing."}
{"text":"We really tried to give this place plenty of time to work out all the kinks. First time there and so disappointed. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and Jr ordered the Fried Chicken plate. Both of our plates were barely luke warm. My waffle was burnt and so dry I could hardly get it down and his fried chicken was so dry it looked like the turkey off of National Lampoo's Christmas Vacation. Plus our server never even refilled our water after all the dry food. That was definitely a one and done!"}
{"text":"Delicious food in a really neat atmosphere. Great wait staff too. Thank you Emily and Amanda."}
{"text":"I've been to Nellie's two more times since my first visit in July, and I have come to the conclusion that I just dont think it's all that. This is largely due to the way I like to eat (I'm not much of a carb-loader), but it's also about execution and lack of flavor. I am a Southerner and this is not like any Southern food anyone in my family has ever made. As alluded to, most of the menu items are heavy on carbs - biscuits, potatoes, grits, green bean casserole, etc. so understand that these will be your choices as it is typical of the genre of cuisine. There are some menu items that are lighter though. I ordered roasted white meat chicken, and it was flavorless and overcooked to the thready stage, and must of come from the midget chicken farm as the portion was so small.  What I give both stars credit for is that the staff is just excellent. Everyone is always so friendly and welcoming. The servers DO exude Southern hospitality, and are excellent ambassadors for the business."}
{"text":"Slooooooooooooooooooow!!! If you're in a hurry this is not the place for you.  The food was good. The burger was cooked correctly the french fries in the coleslaw tasted good the macaroni and cheese it was very good depending on what type of macaroni and cheese you like it was screaming in the center like a cream cheese base with just some sharp cheddar gingerly sprinkled on top for me the cheddar cheese melted on top was the best part. The meatloaf was OK. We ordered the pimento cheese as an appetizer of course it didn't come out before our food I inquired about it the response was \"I put the order in\"! After the food arrived our appetizer came out and we were told \"the order was put in we just didn't have enough people to bring it out it's been ready\""}
{"text":"A great surprise in Belmont... Sweet tea and biscuits all the way.  I hopped on over to the Belmont area to visit the Botanical Gardens and needed some food before I putzed around all day.  My original pick wasn't open that day so I drove around until I found something that looked good.  This visit was most def pre-plant based days... even though I probably would have cheated (hard) here.  For a quick app, I shared the biscuits and gravy with my wife.  The perfect amount of spice paired with perfectly fluffy biscuits.  The biscuits were great except for a sudden bite into something very bitter (baking soda/powder/tartar, maybe?). Once, I got through that... we were back to being awesome.  Chicken and waffles was the selection of the AM here.  The chicken was deliciously crispy and sitting atop a cornbread waffle.  Once I coated them suckers in the cinnamon honey butter... we were in business like you wouldn't believe.  Chicken and waffles are a southern staple and fit in well with the vibe of this place.  Vibe - Laid back and busy at the same time.  Rustic, yet a fresh/modern feel to the entire place.  Maybe it was due to the openness of the dining area.  There is a stage for bands and we were fortunate to be there during a brunch performance.  The music is loud enough to hear but quiet enough to enable patrons to have conversation with their table/s.  Price - Extremely nice for a nicer sit down restaurant.  I was impressed that my entree was only $13 and very filling.  Service - They get stuff done... a little fast-paced but everyone is very attentive.  I made them aware of my biscuit and they assured me I could have another if I really wanted.  Once I realized that it wasn't the entire biscuit, I was completely content with the ones that I had."}
{"text":"Beware the Mac and Cheese!!   I'd like to start by saying the following review does not reflect on the quality of Nellie's sangria. It was truly amazing. 5 stars!   The vibe was awesome. Live music, chic/rustic decor, even some fabulous JoBros posters on the way to the bathroom. The owners walked around to introduce themselves, which was extremely nice. Overall, 5 stars for atmosphere.   However, the food left much to be desired. I ordered the Smoke Wagon (pulled pork -- NC sourced -- with a side of mac and cheese and pickled veggies). Restaurants should almost always be judged by their mac and cheese, especially in the South. While the pulled pork was pretty good (not spectacular), the mac and cheese was borderline inedible. And it's rare for me to come across a mac I don't like. While the presentation was nothing short of mouth-watering, the actual taste left me feeling empty and disappointed. It tasted as if they put an entire bag of Ritz crackers on top of a bland mixture of cheese and noodles. Sad. And on top of this, my mediocre \"southern meal\" cost me an arm and a leg. Devastating.   I suggest coming here for drinks, music, and maybe split a desert amongst friends. But whatever you do, don't get the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but takes for-ever. There was a 15 min wait so we took a bar table. Bartender was backed up so hostess brought table setting and biscuit (really good). Waited too long for drinks...then too long to place order ....then another long wait for food. 1 hour 45 mins overall !  Catfish was good, roasted veggies great! Chicken and dumplings good ...lots of chicken but needed more broth. Green bean casserole good on first bites but maybe too rich. Meh."}
{"text":"I don't see the hype. Just because you put the Jonas family behind something doesn't give you a good product or good service. I've eaten there several times and done take out as well..  Terrible food. Overpriced. Long waits. Limited menu and the food is either bland or over spiced  and I've gone a few times and something has always been wrong - over cooked, undercooked, completely wrong....just terrible. And it's so expensive. The staff is inadequate (with the exception if s rare group of truly wonderful servers who have been there since day 1) and management is on par with how bad the food is."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place in Belmont by a long-shot. Once you get past the family connection there isn't much to it. The food is mediocre at best, and that's if you really like Southern cuisine. With Belmont and the surrounding areas now beginning to blossom with culture, there are too many other choices to be bothered by a novelty act. Sure, this local business deserves one visit but by no means make it a special occasion."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 14 yr anniversary at Nellies last night, we had a great time, we enjoyed the food, the music and the hospitality. It's a charming place and I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Overall the food is actually pretty good but I knocked it down for terrible service and Luke warm food. We got seated and probably was 10mins before anyone came over and the restaurant was half empty. We ordered pimento cheese fries which were super good, tad salty so may skip the bacon next time as I'm sure it added to it. My husband got the friend chicken and gravy which was good but like warm. I got the chicken dumplings which same lukewarm. The soup was a little runny, expected a little thicker with the dumplings. We would have said something about our food but the waitress never came back until after we finally decided to eat and were almost done. We finished and waited about 25mins for the bill. Then the credit card wasn't returned and when we asked she has no idea until she finally found it on the floor as she had dropped it. Super cute place, good prices but bad service. Hoping was an off night and I may try again"}
{"text":"The service was less to be desired. The food was COLD, it was hard to get enjoyed the food due to it's temperature. Perhaps they should mentioned that they close their kitchen by 9:20 in Friday. Feeling rushed and the staff cleaning, one waiter took her work shirt and her undershirt. Our waiter was so \"busy\" chatting with the band members, we had to asked one staff members if we could get to get a box to take the food home and warm up the food. He brought 2 small plastic containers, I asked him for a box, since I still had 3/4 of my food left over fried chicken drumstick, winter vegetable (sweet potatoes and something else) mac and cheese, and the pimento left over the appetizer. We were able to get our check by another waiter, 20 minutes after we had finished:   The place is gorgeous, the food has potential, staff needs to be retained. I wouldn't go back there again. I hope management and the owner realizes that if they continue down this road, the restaurant is going to suffer. You could tell someone invested a lot of money into the building."}
{"text":"Food was great and lived up to hype. Live band right next to table made talking difficult but enjoyed the music."}
{"text":"Absolute gem for the area! The service was great, the food was great, the inside was beautiful, the entertainment was outstanding. Waitresses would get up on stage and sing with the band and these girls are not just doing karaoke, every girl who got up on stage to sing wasn't just good but extremely talented. I ordered the chicken fried steak and drunken collard greens. Folks, these collard greens are something else. Best I've ever had! Love this place and looked forward to going back."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this restaurant first struck me as a little bit eerie as if I were in a Stephen King novel. No offense to the late Nellie Jonas, but the large painting you see when you first walk in seemed creepy (but then I found quite humorous because she has a cast iron skillet tied to her waist..you know how heavy those things are?) along with the birds on the chandeliers. Once seated, you do begin to notice how good of a job they did on designing the place.  Even the silverware was unique.  I also enjoyed the fact that they had a live band playing inside. My curiosity lead me to a set of stairs that I saw customers taking so I decided to see for myself.  It ended up being a very nice rooftop dining area with a bar.  I was really disappointed that the host didn't mention the rooftop since it was a really nice evening.   We decided to order the following dishes:  Chicken and Waffles - The chicken was tender and juicy and the cinnamon honey butter that accompanied it just made the perfect combination. I highly recommend this dish if you're a chicken and waffles fan.  Chicken and Dumplings - You could tell this was homemade and it was delicious as well.  Sweet Potato Waffle Fries - The fries were thinly cut and they definitely over fried them so we didn't enjoy them at all.  Four Cheese Mac - The fact that they were crispy on top already won me over. No complaints here!  Overall, I would definitely stop by again if I was in the area. :)"}
{"text":"Well bland and expensive explains this place best. Cracker barrel provides a more genuine southern experience.... skip nellies and save your money there are many better places to eat in Belmont. The service was good and was the only redeeming quality of the place."}
{"text":"I gave it 3 out of 5 stars...and all 3 Stars go to the fried Chicken!  That chicken was perfectly fried and crispy.  It came out hot and very fresh.  I got the chicken and waffles for brunch, and I definitely had better waffles before.  The corn bread waffles were just not a good combo with the fried chicken, you need something light and fluffy.  I substituted grilled veggies for the fruit and I was glad I did, they were pretty good.  Next time I would just come try dinner, brunch wasn't worth it!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was good. Our server was friendly and welcoming. The complimentary corn bread and biscuits weren't that good and we barely touched them. For our meals, my fiance had fried chicken with mac and cheese and collards. He enjoyed his meal. The bite of mac and cheese I had was good but I couldn't taste the bacon (which is listed in the description of the item). I'm not a crazy bacon fan so I was okay with that, but still - just know there isn't much bacon flavor. He LOVED the greens (in fact, he ate his and half of mine).  I had the chicken breast (gravy on the side) mashed potatoes and collards. They were all good. I'm picky about gravy and this gravy was kinda bland, so I'm glad I ordered it on the side. I asked for a some hot sauce and the waitress brought out homemade hot sauce that was yummy!  I liked this place but I wouldn't make a special trip to Belmont for it. That being said, if you're nearby - try it out."}
{"text":"I went for brunch. It was ordinary. Mostly bland. I'll try lunch or dinner before I write it off."}
{"text":"Nellies in nearby Belmont is a lively and popular restaurant. The fun atmosphere derives from the fact that there is often live music playing. Good food is also served here. However, on a recent visit, service was less than what I have come to expect. Granted they were somewhat overwhelmed with a wedding party or such. But if your dining guests must have an unreasonable wait AT LEAST offer a complimentary beverage or snack. Otherwise, one of my favorate places to eat."}
{"text":"Theme of the night was too little and cheap. Started off walking in to the band playing ridiculous loud. Couldn't hear anyone at our table, not even the person next to you. The band was really really really good though. If I was in the mood to listen to music and have a drink, would have been great. But we had a group of friends trying to catch up, so we sat and yelled at each other for the first 45 min.   The service started off pretty poor. My Old fashioned tasted like water, so I just asked for some neat bourbon instead. The waiter came back and gave me maybe 3/4 of an oz. I was not thrilled so I just walked up to the bar and asked them to top it off (and apologized for being the annoying guy). The bartender borderline rolled her eyes, didn't say sorry, barely topped it off and turned away to continue talking with her coworker. So it took 3 attempts to still be not satisfied with my drink.   Next they brought around biscuits which you have to ask for, and they did not bring enough for each person at the table. We got a few appetizers to share (there was 6 of us) so we got 3 appetizers. We each essentially had one bite of the very very ungenerously small portions.   I had chicken and waffles that were great, except they gave me a thimble of syrup so it was insanely dry. My wife had a \"blackened\" chicken sandwhich which was just a grilled piece of chicken on a bun with no sauce or flavor.   From a Southern comfort food place you don't expect them to be cheap and stingy on everything - with a few easy tweaks this place could be stellar. I have no interest in returning."}
{"text":"A group of coworkers and I had lunch at Nellie's for the first time yesterday. Robin, our server, was great at explaining the menu to us, including some of her favorites. The food was delicious and plentiful! You won't leave Nellie's hungry. The decor of this restaurant was very cool, it was clean and the chairs were super comfy. I highly recommend Nellie's kitchen for lunch and can't wait to go back with my husband for dinner."}
{"text":"Made Sunday brunch  reservation via OpenTable. Brunch are good. Make sure you request biscuits to the table. The Sweet Caroline is yum. They had live music they played for 15 minute intervals; I'm 50/50 on if I liked it or not but that's subjective.  I had the breakfast plate with eggs, cheddar grits, bacon and a side of Sweet Caroline ( sweet potatoes casserole with caramel pecans) Didn't like the eggs and my mom didn't care for the Chicken and waffles  All in all I would come back maybe not for brunch  Pro tips: There's ample parking in the back. Ask for peach preserves for the biscuits yum.  *Disclaimer: There's a few cotton-themed fixtures and paintings that can be perceived in poor taste. My Grandma picked cotton so she was uncomfortable with the cotton light fixture over the bar and the massive portrait painting of the lady on a cotton dress by the stage to the point she had to switch seats. I get it, staying true to history and all, but I think it was done in poor taste without of thought of potential customers background"}
{"text":"Nellie's is such a fantastic addition to the Belmont restaurant \"scene\". We eat dinner her often and it's always a hard selection to make because everything is so good! The Chicken & Waffles is delicious. The cornbread waffle gives it a unique spin that you won't find elsewhere. The Chicken & Dumplings is another favorite. This so greatly exceeds the chicken and dumplings you will find elsewhere. A true Nellie's fan knows to ask for the biscuits and oh-my, the biscuits are delicious. If you're lucky, ask for some of the chunky applesauce to go, because you will be too full to eat it after your meal, but it is a must! Yum!"}
{"text":"First time at Nellie's for Sunday Brunch and I will definitely be back. Just walking in the place is adorable. Biscuits and butter were beyond amazing and our entree were even better. Great service and live music. This place is a must if youre in the area."}
{"text":"There's literally nothing else in Belmont like Nellie's. The first thing you'll notice when you walk in is the decor. How do I describe it, not being up to date on interior design terms? Upscale, southern chic? It's trendy but taps into Nellie's upbringing, a rural life in the south. It's incredibly cool, to summarize.   The food certainly matches, being upscale southern at affordable prices. The fried chicken, chicken and dumplings, green beans, mashed potatoes, all fantastic. What else have I tried? Oh, the desserts...if you like carrot cake, then definitely treat yourself to one of theirs. And all us southern folk enjoy banana pudding, so try one of those while you're at it too.   There's a bar upstairs too, and the view is nice. I can imagine enjoying this on warm summer nights. Nellie's is worth the visit, so go already."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting.  I was excited to try it. When we got there we were told it would be 45 minutes to be seated.  That is understandable bc of the time of day.  After about 30ish minutes we got seated.  Literally no one acknowledged we were there.  I even noticed a table get seated after us and they had a server already .About after 20 minutes we decided to go.  We went someone where down the street.  They seated us and got our food drink order in less than ten minutes and they were slammed!! Very disappointed in the service of Nellies."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing time here tonight! Our service was fantastic, our order was completely right, we were given free desserts from Papa Jonas & had so much fun singing along with the live music. The atmosphere is louder in the main room because of the live music but if you'd rather it be a little more quiet they do have other seating, it's a lot bigger than you'd think. They were very busy but it only took about 30ish min to get food & we barely even noticed the wait because of the live band, they're incredible! If you live within a couple hours of Nellie's it is worth the drive! Personally I advise to get the friend chicken & don't you dare leave w/out getting banana pudding, I hated it until I tried theirs & now I'm hooked! My friends got smoked portobello mushrooms, chicken & gravy, pulled pork BBQ, & everyone couldn't stop raving about how much they loved it! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I   was excited to visit this establishment and regretted it almost immediately. Our waitness was slow  to follow up on our drink order and never got Splenda for my unsweetened tea. We started with the pimento cheese appetizer and found it to be very bland. The description on the menu promised a mix of peppers and pimento...couldn't detect a trace of any spice. The only saving grace was the melba toast -although the number of toast was short for the serving of cheese dip.  Thirty minutes later we placed our order and anticipated \"good southern cooking\". The waitress stated that the chicken and gravy along with the meat loaf was very popular . She made a point to say everything was cooked to order and proud to state most food was locally sourced (kudos).  We decided to follow the recommendations and 40 minutes later  our food was served. We were there close to opening (5:15) and an hour later we received our meal..unacceptable!  It was lacking in presentation. My meatloaf was cold and the mac and cheese was over cooked and dry.  If  there was bacon and a blend of four cheeses...they were marginal ingredients.  The.breadcrumbs were abundant.   It lacked basic salt and pepper and  frozen Stouffer brand is far  more palatable.   The meatloaf was ground beef with hint of parsley and again no  seaonings...it failed to include meatloaf basics- onion.. green peppers. ..bacon... the only taste was  from the squirts  of ketchup on top!  Surprised that the green bean casserole was bland and cold.  How can this restaurant call itself \" fine sountern style food\"  when basic seasonings are missing? Overall it was a terrible meal and would have said as much if the waitress would have returned to refill my tea.  Overall quite a disappointment for the hype in local magazines. . Perhaps if salt and pepper were on the tables, I could  have doctoed/added tomake the dishes more like my grandmother's style of southern cooking.  So disappointing on every dining level.  Belmont could have a \"jewel\" but it will need some flavor and seasoning added.  I can't see this  establishment surving with so many other choices in the town.....can't make it on decor and \"Hollywood.\"connections for very long.  One  star is a stretch:("}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Nellie's since they opened in 2016 and I finally had the opportunity on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.  The ambience and d√©cor of Nellie's is wonderful and boasts  fantastic lighting and chandeliers.  The employees know the meaning of \"southern hospitality.\"  Their  guests are treated like family and the food tastes like it came right out of grandma's kitchen on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  The sweet tea was sweet, the pimento was creamy and rich and the chicken and dumplings was like no other.    If you are looking for a down home-southern meal, with great service in a ambient setting, stop by Nellie's.  I can't wait to try their Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Nellie's Southern Kitchen in Belmont, NC is a wonderful addition to a beautiful historic town.  The atmosphere is warm and friendly and the decor is beautiful.  The menu is full of variety, but you must not pass up the chicken and dumplings.  All the ingredients are fresh and this gem of a restaurant operates without a can opener, microwave or freezer.  There is such attention to detail here, from the food to the friendly wait staff. I would recommend everyone passing by to make a stop to Nellie's Restaurant for some awesome food.  House band and rooftop dining is also a plus.  We loved our experience and plan to return as soon as we can."}
{"text":"It was a nice place and the food was good. Would have loved to be there when they had entertainment. The waitress was not the best and she did not seem to know what they had and did not have but other thatn that we ahd a nice meal."}
{"text":"The drive from Charlotte was well worth it. Great food, prices and a nice atmosphere. Next time I'll make sure to stop by when a live band is performing."}
{"text":"Great presentation when it comes to the food the fries chicken is cooked perfectly and the service is nice"}
{"text":"We came in around 230 for a late lunch, and we wish we hadn't. We were seated right away, but then it took at least 15 min for someone to come and greet us and take our drink order.  It then took even longer for us to actually get our drinks, and order even an appetizer.  We had to personally ask for silverware to be brought out to the table, and forget even having a small plate. We asked for some and they brought one.  One for a party of 7! I guess we had to share and pass the plate around. We had to go up and ask someone near the drinks for refills on our drinks.  It took over an hour for our food to come out of the kitchen. Again we had to go find the manager and complain, but right when we did that the food was brought out.  It had been sitting awhile.  Everything was lukewarm.  Mashed Potatoes were almost congealed, fries were cold, my daughters chicken tenders were cold and dry.  We ordered the special which remained untouched by some.  Just overall almost inedible food.  We should have waited the 20 minutes for a spot at the string bean up the street.  We probably would've gotten food faster.     Now let me clue you all into something, like I said earlier we came in well after the lunch rush, there were maybe 3 other tables with 4 people at them. There was an over abundance of servers and staff to the point that a lot of them were just standing around chatting if they weren't out back smoking.  And everyone had a different excuse for our poor service and even crappier meal.  I'll never go back.   On the plus side, the rolls are good. They get one star from me for decent rolls."}
{"text":"(Ignore the obvious snapchat post) First time at Nellie's and upon first impression, it definitely looks like a place I would frequent. Interior design is super industrial and spacious, which I love.   Starting with the only con: Parking is lim-i-ted.  Pros: Ordered the fried chicken entree with four-cheese mac and drunken collards. Those collards though....my Lord. Heaven in a bowl. The mac was super creamy but not overwhelming. The chicken was crispy in every bit of the word. So flavorful but not super salty like I've experienced in other soul food places.   The bartender was awesome and chatted me up a decent amount. Plus, the manager was very social with everyone but not in a cheesy way but familial, which is a breath of fresh air. Overall, great first experience! Definitely want to go back and try the cocktails and other dishes!"}
{"text":"Not at all what I expected. Very nice decor and very good location. They had plenty of staff but terrible service. Staff was friendly but obviously inexperienced. There were many servers and hostess but no one seems to be taken care of. The food took 45 mins for us. Food was only sub par. Not bad but not worth it. Never going back. It's sad because it looked like such a nice place."}
{"text":"Reading the past reviews, I just had to write. Nellie's is 5 stars all the way around! They must have gotten their act together since other people went because service and food were fantastic!! (After all its only been 3 months open) I had out of town guests and wanted to go to Sunday Brunch other than NODA. Nellie's popped and since we were headed to the Gardens, decided to give this place a try. Not disappointed at all!  I did make reservation but we arrived earlier, just as they were opening, and were promptly seated. Decor is straight out of HGTV - beautiful one of a kind light features, tables, chairs, great picture of Nellie on back wall, not to mention the Jonas Bros memorabilia adorn the hallway!  Music just right, staff attentive, even Kevin Sr stopped by to chat with us - great guy!  Food was DELICIOUS!!!  Can't wait to go back & enjoy the rooftop dining area! Kevin - you're on the right track - keep it going as Nellie's is a great place with great food - your grandmother is very proud & smiling!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Southern Comfort food in a beautiful atmosphere w tons of dining options for different party sizes. Loved the chocolate pie and music. Fav part - tons of the wait staff get up and sing w the band and they are GREAT. Fun!"}
{"text":"BE SURE TO EAT BEFORE GOING TO THE RESTAURANT: It's a real shame that going to a beautiful idea restaurant ends up in becoming starved waiting for tea, water, and food, dealing with becoming upset and repeatedly getting up to get your tea, go to the kitchen window, speak with the Chef and hostess.  Especially when they have a ton of team members available, who refuse to work and help one another - the table assigned to a server is the only LOOK or help you'll get.  NO ONE IS RUNNING THIS DINING ROOM OR WATCHING IT.  This ended up being a disappointment to all and especially embarrassing for the Jonas Brothers and loving family they have.  As a Restaurateur, Hotelier, Waiter, Chef and Butler, I've done and worked in all of these roles and went to the kitchen twice.  The second time our salads had been sitting in the window for quite a while, and certain members of the floor team just do not care about the guests in this place.  DESIGN: fantastic, SILVERWARE: forks difficult to eat with, SERVICE: you'll starve and begin to shake either via anger or being hungry and shifting into anaphylactic shock, CARE OF FAMILY HERITAGE: a few team members are interested in running the Jonas name into the ground, PLATING: magnificent, FOOD: pretty darn good but destroyed by the repeated and continued ruination of the service and no management interested in operating the floor."}
{"text":"Limited menu and overpriced. Our server told us three times she was bringing us more water it took us the third time to get the water. No salt and pepper shakers on the table you have to ask for it. All we ordered were salads and they came out wrong and had to be remade. Won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch for Mother's Day can be a lesson in frustration at many restaurants.  Not here!  Service was excellent, as was the food and music.  Thank you."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Nellies for the first time last week. Our server, Paulina recommended the shrimp and grits and it was delicious. My friend ordered the chicken and dumplings and loved them as well. The service was exceptional and she was very attentive. We will definitely be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Nellies on Sept 30th for dinner was close to great.  Well last night, 10/8/16  I could not have been more disappointed in so many things.  First I had called on Friday early afternoon and made a reservation for 645p and specifically asked for to be seated at 1 of 2 tables I gave them as choices.  Well when we arrived on time I was told sorry, we just don't promise tables, even with reservations but they had made a note of what I had asked for out by my name.  So we were seated at a table right in front of the band and it was so loud that it was hard to hear each other talk.  Second, the band was less than enthusiastic.  They sang and looked like they really didn't even want to be there.  At 7:10 the band stopped playing and at 8:10p when we left they still had not returned to play.  They were one of the reasons I went back to Nellies for they were awesome on 9/30.  Next I had ordered a vodka tonic and asked for a specific vodka...waitress had no idea if they even had Kettle 1...well they didn't and the bartender just selected a Vodka instead of the waitress coming back and asking me what I would prefer after telling me what they actually did have....then the drink didn't even taste like it had any Vodka in it so we returned it and when it came back it still had that \"minus Vodka\" taste.  The date I was with really doesn't drink and tasted it and he immediately said wow, there is nothing in this drink or the Vodka has been watered down in the bottle....Then when our food came they brought my date a totally different dish than what he had ordered....he ordered fried chicken extra crispy and he got baked chicken with a side he had not even ordered.  So they took it back....by the time I had finished my meal he still didn't have his meal.  It finally came and the green bean casserole was cold.  So needless to say this night ended up pretty much a disaster at Nellies....somewhat like so many of the reviews I have read that others have posted.  Such a shame for it could be a consistent 4 star probably but they are very inconsistent it seems with service and other amenities, like the band that they have built in.  I'm not sure I will go back....and I really loved their house band the first night I heard them."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. We had the pimento bacon burger and chicken-n-gravy. Delicious! We sat on the rooftop and Robin was our waitress. She was slammed but did a great job! So sweet and friendly! We will be going back to check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"My family wanted to do brunch to celebrate our Cousin Marshall's birthday and I immediately thought of Nellie's in Belmont since we are all scattered in Gastonia, Dallas and Charlotte. What a beautiful establishment! From the ambience, the service, the choices and atmosphere, we are very pleased. We will definitely recommend and will definitely patronize again and soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in one Friday night to get some dinner before the concert in the park. They sat us right away, but it was still early. They had a live band which was good but very loud. My mom and I both had the front porch punch which was very good. Bathrooms and restaurant were very clean. We decided to split the spring salad and the fried catfish with hush puppiess and Cole slaw. The salad was outstanding and the fish was good but lacked seasoning. It was cooked perfectly though. All in all we had a good time and will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. The chicken n gravy was the best I've ever had. Very flavorful and moist. Collards are a must and the banana pudding is ridiculous!!! Can't wait to go back. Met Mr. Jonas on the way out and he was so gracious and kind. Great place."}
{"text":"Just had the best experience we could have asked for from anywhere.  We called ahead and let the staff know we had a rather large group planning to come by tonight and when we arrived, we (25+) were all accommodated (our minor athletes were seated together) and parents were scattered at various table nearby.  We were offered a backroom, but with the wonderful live music, we requested main dining room if possible.  Despite the size of our group, EVERYONE had a wonderful meal and experience.  The owners made there way around to each table to greet us and thank us for coming, but we were the ones that needed to be thanking them!  I will be back next time in Belmont.  Top of my list.  Thank you Nellie!"}
{"text":"We have had the great honor of hosting an event at this place.  I was not thinking the food could be pulled off as well as it was.  I was impressed both with their staffing, food, and services.    We had a hosted shower for our daughter and they worked well with my wife and they went outside their requirements to accommodate and made sure were taken care of properly.   The food I would give a 99 plus The services I would give an A+ The building and set up I would give the a Superior"}
{"text":"My wife and I love Nellie's. Food is incredible and everyone is very friendly.  The music Thursday through Sunday evenings adds another great touch. We always look forward to coming here. One of our fav spots!!  We drive 20 minutes to get here and it'd be worth an even longer drive!!"}
{"text":"They're trying but need to take heed of the negative comments. We have given it three tries (limited options in Belmont) and each time had similar issues. First time passed it off as new jitters. Went tonight and again had  several issues. Limited choices. Ordered an appetizer and it came quickly but our entrees quickly followed. That is one of my eating out pet peeves. Please let me enjoy the appetizer before delivering the entree.  I even mentioned to the server that they just delivered the appetizer and we hadn't time to eat it yet. She giggled and said \"that's okay.\" Not sure if she got it. Had to ask several times for water and the server had to ask a couple times for our bar drinks.  It is loud and chairs do scrape the floor and make crazy noise.  I love the concept and decor. Hope they can get some of the kinks out."}
