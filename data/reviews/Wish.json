{"text":"Fried Calamari with Aioli & Salsa Fresca The lightly breaded and deep-fried rings and tentacles were tender and neither overcooked nor too salty - two things that often ruin calamari. It wasn't put in the deep fryer for too long, so it wasn't especially crispy and the batter was so-so. I personally would have liked a bit more spice. It was okay, but I've had better value from Mezes in Greektown. The *best* calamari I've ever tried was from Yoso's-Call Joso's in Yorkville - pricey, but spiced and fried to perfection. Would not order calamari from Wish again.   Romaine Salad w Cherry Tomatoes, Herb Dressing, Feta Cheese, & Crostini   The waitress made a strong recommendation for the salad - she raved that she loved it and it is really great starter. Really? I think the picture speaks for itself. Romaine lettuce, a couple cherry tomatoes and an unmemorable dressing. Very poor value at $9.   Lamb Burger with Tomato Tzatziki & Feta The saving grace of our lunch - the lamb was nicely ground and mixed with a good dash of cumin. Tender and juicy, I savoured it to make up for the disappointing salad and so-so calamari. The bun was a typical white hamburger-type of bun - too bad, really. I think that a great bun on a good burger makes a world of difference. The fries were decent - nice, thin, a little on the softer side (like the calamari! Perhaps this is just their style)  The patio and interior are simple and great for a summer brunch or lunch. Fresh, sunny flowers at each table, simple decor, and comfy couches created a low-key, relaxed atmosphere. However, for the value I don't think I will be returning for lunch...although I may give the weekend brunch another go. Maybe."}
{"text":"\"Wish\" is short for \"wish I never came here\". Great patio, so-so food, absolutely atrocious service! Asked a server to pack my food to go, 3 times! Finally after 40 min in +30C weather someone came to pack it , just to bring it right back in the clear plastic container!? In this weather? If they treat customer's food like this, I don't even want to know what's going on in the kitchen. Definitely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Food: 2.5/5 Service: 2/5 Atmosphere: 4/5  I went for their summerlicious lunch menu. It was rainy today and we sat outside on the patio, so the seats were a bit wet and damp, but overall the atmosphere and the decor of the place was very dainty and nice. I think the patio would be a great place to eat at on a sunny day.  I ordered the sautee shrimps for my appetizer, the mussels and frites for my entree, and the apple cinnamon divine for dessert. All of the above tasted just average. I would say the shrimp was my favourite, but the portion was small (possibly because it was an appetizer only and it was from the summerlicious menu?) I got to try my friend's kale salad and sloppy brisket melt as well. The brisket was a little better than the rest of the dishes, but once again, nothing special. The apple cinnamon divine was a rice butter cake with apple and cinnamon, which tasted good, but too bad it was served cold (I'm not sure if their intention was to serve it cold though).  The main reason I gave this restaurant such a low rating is mostly because of their slow service. They were all nice servers, but it was difficult to flag them down. We even got up to the little bar area that they had to ask for cutlery. When we were able to flag them down without having to get up from our seats, we had to ask several times for our condiments. My friend ordered juice, which only came after we reminded them and when she was half way through her entree.  I probably would try other brunch places before I come back again to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Food is really good. But I wish there was more seating. It can't be crowded at times, and best is you make a reservation before going there."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group for a friend's birthday. The food itself was good, the service was subpar. The restaurant is ill-equipped to handle large groups. It took over an hour to get our bills, and when we did, our server slammed them down on the table and instructed us to figure it out for ourselves. They only have one credit card machine so checking out took even longer. It was also sweltering hot and there was no A/C to make matters worse.  Any request we made of the waitress (hot sauce, more water, more drinks), she responded to as if it was a chore.  I would recommend for small groups where they are equipped to handle the table, but for large groups, go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I went to Wish this afternoon with 10 friends to celebrate a birthday. We all loved the decor and ambiance of the restaurant. However here are the pros and cons that we noted from our experience:   Pros:  - The ambiance was really nice - The home fries were delicious - The daily special (breakfast burrito) was fantastic and had a lot of flavour  Cons:  - Service was slow  - Meals all came out at different times - The eggs were cooked very inconsistently (i.e. a few people ordered the Eggs Benedict and two of the poached eggs were overcooked like a hard-boiled egg. When we told the server and showed him, his response was \"Well I never put in a special request for how you wanted them cooked!\") - One of our friends ordered the pancakes and compared to the other dishes (specifically the french toast) they were very small  - We ordered the Aussie Burger, and first they brought out the wrong burger. Once they sent it back to the kitchen and brought out the correct burger (15 minutes later) they forgot the fried egg on it (and the burger had very little flavour)! When we informed the server, we told him that we didn't want to send it back as everyone else was almost done their meal, but we just wanted him to let the kitchen know. However, he really didn't seem to care too much even though this was basically the third mistake already. - When the bill came out, they had double charged one of the meals and we had to get that corrected  The server, as well as a woman who may have been a manager, seemed annoyed with us and shrugged as off as we kindly let them know of the errors. I don't see myself returning here in the near future."}
{"text":"Their food is really good! The location is quite quaint (small and cozy). The service was good. One star docked because the tables are SO close together I could not hear the person I was with!"}
{"text":"Light and airy decor.  Food is good but not amazing.  Getting served and getting your bill paid at the end can take forever.  This is what it was like when it first opened and this is what it is still like in 2016."}
{"text":"Wish was very popular when I came for brunch with my friends on Easter Sunday - I think they were actually fully booked! We made a reservation and were seated right away. The restaurant is quite cozy - for a party of 3, they sat us in an awkward and busy area by the washroom where people kept on bumping into my friend's chair every time someone heads to the washroom. The table was also set by a pole with a mirror panel so it was weird eating while staring at myself.   Regardless, the food was not bad. I ordered the eggs in purgatory, which is basically a fancy name for shakshouka. The portion was generous and it was very flavourful - it was perfect for a chilly day. Service was friendly but the food took a long time to arrive, probably because of how busy they were."}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to get in here for brunch for nearly a year now but anytime I tried there was always a super long wait...which now makes total sense. I can't remember the last time I received such painfully slow service. It really wasn't busy enough to account for the 20 minute wait time we experienced just to be greeted by someone to take our drink orders, or the 40 minute wait time it took at the end to get our bills. Our coffees were luke warm and far from fresh, and my caesar was nothing to write home about.  However, there are certainly good things to be said about Wish. It's unfortunate that the service was so awful as the actual atmosphere and decor of the restaurant was beautiful, quaint, and totally insta-worthy. And if a review was based on food alone, Wish would probably be getting 5 stars from me. The eggs benny with leek and parmesan fondue ($15, subbed regular bacon instead of peameal for an extra $4) was amazing. The Aussie Burger ($15) - turkey patty, grilled pineapple, a fried egg, beetroot crisps, lettuce and tomato - was delicious (although the patty was a little too thick for my taste). Home fries were cooked to perfection. All 7 of us were very pleased with our food. But nothing ruins a great meal like terrible service, and for such a nice place, we really expected better."}
{"text":"I love Wish.  It's owned by the same people who own 7 West and it's absolutely delicious. the waiters are just plain hot. The indoor bar is great and cozy in the winter as both a coffee bar to read the paper at while you sip espresso and as a good spot to have a beer or a glass of vino with a friend.  in the summer, they open their lush patio which is mostly white couches and tables with chairs. There is also a dry ice fountain in the middle of the patio that ads to the ambiance with soft smoke.  The patio is split in two parts, the bulk being non smoking and the smaller patio is uncovered for smokers.  They serve a full dinner, but realistically, it's a bit cramped, so really you come here for the great aps' and desserts, or to have a cool mojito after work.  Did I mention that the waiters are really really handsome? Great spot off dirty old Yonge. i recommend it for anyone."}
{"text":"We met for bunch Sunday morning and the food and ambiance  at Wish get 5 stars, but the service was so terrible, it was laughable. Wish has a shabby-chic French cottage vibe that is as perfect for a romantic dinner as it is for brunch with friends. The menu has so many great items, it was tough to choose.  The dinner menu looks equally amazing. Here is the issue we had was with the service. I had wanted a coffee, but Wish doesn't carry soy or lactose free milk, so being lactose intolerant, I was out of luck, or I thought, when our super cute server offered me 2% as alternate.  Hmmm. So we ordered raspberry champagne cocktails (Tina's) which took about  10 minutes to arrive. They were beautiful,girly and delicious. When the our super cute server came back, we asked him about the specials, which he explained he didn't know because the 'Specials sign' is now in an alley. He had to go check.  When our super cute server returned, he proudly had learned what was in the omelet of the day, and that the hash special was beef two ways. We asked about the 2 ways...and super cute server told us that 'it's beef two different ways, like two kinds of beef, two ways.' We asked him to be more specific, and he said he didn't know, and had to ask.  He returned with the details, of which I recall that beef tenderloin was one of the two ways...but it wasn't for us. I asked if there was dairy in the omelet and super cute server again had to check.   He took our order..but didn't write it down: daily omelet, no dairy and scotch eggs with a side of bacon. When the food arrived, minus the side of bacon, super cute server asked us if we needed anything else...we asked for ketchup and...reminded him about the side of bacon. He said 'Sure! I'll be right back.' Well, we never received the ketchup or the side of bacon and we never got a chance to order a second drink, even if we wanted one.  He buzzed back and forth between tables and it never seemed to dawn on him that we were missing part of our meal, that we didn't get ketchup, or that our flutes were empty. Finally, when our super cute server came back to clear our plates, he asked how everything was...we were laughing at this point...we just got the bill and got out of there. Wish was delicious and cosy and has some serious talent in the kitchen. They just need to ensure that their servers have the same passion--and are not just super cute."}
{"text":"Average food, with terrible service. We had a reservation for lunch at 1pm, for a party of 3. After being seated, it took about 15 minutes for our server to come and take our orders. Our server was not responsive - she hardly spoke and was not welcoming, very inattentive, and never refilled our water.  It took close to an hour to get our food. We inquired with our server after about 40 minutes, and she did not offer a helpful response. When asked how much longer the wait would be, she simply said, \"I don't know. Our orders are backed up.\" A little while later we still had not received our food, so we complained to the manager, who then told the kitchen, but she also did not seem to care that we had been waiting for a very long time.   After about an hour, we finally got our food, which was average and definitely not worth the wait. We asked for our bill right away as well, and even that took a long time (we had to ask twice for the bill). The manager did not charge us for one of our orders, but in my opinion, all of our orders should have been free. At no point did anyone even apologize to us, after having complained twice. And upon leaving, no one looked at us, thanked us or said good bye.   A real shame for a place that looks very inviting and visually appealing. The restaurant was not even packed, and for a restaurant that is located in a prime business location, there are many working people who probably come here for lunch (such as us), and we shouldn't have to wait an hour for food.  We will NOT be coming back."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about this place I was excited to finally try it out.     I wish I has something to review. It started with a complete lack of acknowledgement that we wanted a table and ended up us walking out because the waiter cared less to know what we wanted to order. Terrible service. The worst I have had in ages."}
{"text":"0 stars. Miserable and unprofessional staff, mediocre food.  My friend ordered crab cakes, halfway through she noticed a piece of hair inside the crab cake.  When we brought this up to the server,  he glanced at it brushed us off by saying it's from the crab. I've had plenty of crab cakes,  never have I seen hair in it. Needless to say,  we lost out appetite and was charged full price.   Will never go back and not recommend."}
{"text":"YES! I'm a big fan of wish's Benedict!!!  visited a couple times for brunch, and all foods are great. Some foods are a little expensive for breakfast or lunch (i.e. salads), but don't worry, you will like all foods there.  Every time i go to the place, customers are mostly couples or friends, so i would say Wish is a good place for dating or chatting with friends."}
{"text":"Hey guys it's your one and only hoodlum eating goodlium. It'd your boy Nav, and that is why I'm not a rapper gentleman I can't rhyme. I leave all that rapping stuff to the professionals. Shout out to P. Reign for being my unofficial sponsor. Unofficial cause he don't know me yet. Anyways on to this restaurant review.  I'm gonna sum this up really quick and for people that wanna know what I think here it is;  Food - 3/5 Service - 1.5/5 - I am being very nice with the .5  For the rest of yall here's my in depth review. Fun fact about me when I was in school I never wrote reviews cause I was a badass and ain't no person gonna tell me what to do.  So it was a Sunday during brunch we walked in at around 1:30 so it was packed we stood inside for at least 15 min for somebody to acknowledge us, and that's after I waved them down. They're lucky this wasn't in the hood or else - guys, we all know what would've happen...I would've waited patiently at the door cause I'm scared of the law.   So once we were waiting for a seat my friends asked the bartender for a drink the lady at the bar said \"I'm the only one at the bar and I have to serve my tables before I do anything\" pretty rude because a normal Bartender would've just said sure just give me a sec. We're asking for a drink not to milk a cow. Anyway so we got our seats and then ordered our food. I had the eggs Benedict they were good but not much depth in flavours. I felt like it should've had a little more of a saltier taste. And also had their drip coffee which was recommended by the waiter as he told me it's really good. I had a sip of it and it was very light coffee, and I'm not going to criticize the coffee as maybe some people like it light.   Overall it's a nice place to bring a date or somebody from cragislist as there's a hotel right beside the place. The developers of this area really thought it through. But all jokes aside if you bring your girl make sure it's an extra special occasion as the bill will rack up and you'll be discussing financing options with your waiter."}
{"text":"A friend and I went around lunch time on Thursday (today) to find this lovely decorated place. Great ambiance and their patio is heated so we chose to sit on the patio. The food was great, my friend and I split the Daily soup which  was carrot and ginger and the black bean burger with a house salad. We also got free bread with hummus which was a nice touch. The soup was hearty, and the burger, though fell apart (as is the case with bean burgers usually), had a meld of complementary flavours. Even the house salad was flavourful, with a great dressing. The service though was sub par. Though there was barely anyone in the restaurant, service was quite slow. We had to ask twice for bills from 2 different people, before it came 15-20 minutes later. In general it took a long time to get our requests and it felt strange to ask the servers, as if it was inconvenient for them.   Tldr: food was great, service, not so much."}
{"text":"Last experience at Wish was a first time after it changed from BlackSkirt. I was there with 3 others. Overall experience was average. The food was great. The service was not so hot.   We had the squash angolotti, duck salad and the daily pasta (x2) which was gnocchi. All plates were great except for the duck salad. The quality of the duck was below average - it was a bit stringy. We had more then a several rounds of cocktails. All very refreshing especially for a hot day.  Our waiter was a bit unattentive. In fact he kept forgetting our water after being asked several times. And the worse part was that it wasn't busy.  He also inadvertently added 2 pork chops and a fried calamari to our bill which we didn't catch until the day after which led to a gong show. I stopped by and called to see what could be done. Knowing full well that it was our error for not having double checked the bill. However the phone call from the owner, I believe, was ridiculous. She had this haughty tone inquiring why we didn't follow up with the waiter when we got the bill. The obvious answer was we simply forgot and we were a bit tipsy.  One would think that the waiter would have entered the order correctly. I would have overlooked the whole over charge but the phone call and tone of voice was quite rude which warranted docking of points. Absolutely no understanding of customer service for the manager and waiter.  Too bad as the patio is lovely."}
{"text":"The atmosphere on a summer evening is wonderful here. There is something very chic and charming about this place -- the scale, the little fountain, the whitewashed tables and seating.  It also attracts a fashionable crowd -- lots of well dressed girls and couples.   Excellent drinks, good food. Be warned the fish tacos are DIY and the fish is fried -- not expecting either. The pickled red onions though were wonderful -- I was inspired to make my own. I had a calamari special which was good, but overly huge portion. Nice rose wine by the glass. The burgers I saw at the next table looked amazing, and I am NOT a burger person normally."}
{"text":"Wish is beautiful.  The decor and look and feel of this spot is truly great, especially given that it's a stone's throw from Yonge and Charles, a not so desirable intersection.    The patio area is quite comfy, but the inside is just as nice.  Decor is always top notch here, so even if the food goes wrong, it'll still have the illusion of beauty.  I've only been for brunch, but it's always delicious.  I've had the standard Wish breakfast, which features all great ingredients (on a very full plate).  The french toast is equally as delicious and sweet.    Service is normally pretty good, though some of the employees seemed dress way more casually than the guests.  That's always been a little odd to me."}
{"text":"Perfect for girls night, very cozy atmosphere, delicious food, great cocktails,"}
{"text":"It's a cute spot and the food is pretty good, if a little over priced. I was put off when they wanted to charge me an extra $3 for pickles to go with my $15 burger. Aren't pickles just a thing that go with burgers? Not impressed. Otherwise an okay place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere here on a weekday evening at 6pm. The dishes we ordered were really delicious; I can't recall the exact name, but one was a burger and the other, lemon butters shrimp spaghetti with mussels.  The burger was very big in portion and filling, and I chose the fries as sides. It wasn't necessarily the BEST burger I had in town, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and quantity. For next time, I would get something else, as there were other dishes that seemed more of their speciality.  My friend ordered the spaghetti which she shared with me, and this dish was definitely the chef's speciality. It was very buttery and soft with great flavour from mussels and the shrimp. It didn't smell fishy at all and I really enjoyed the dish.  The atmosphere is very cozy with good seating and dimmed lights inside. The patio is pretty cool and it's definitely an insta-worthy place ;)"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for over 10 years and it has  never disappointed me.  I have always considered Wish a hidden gem even before it was published in NOW magazine. The Shrimp martini and lamb chops are always my favorite. Menu does change every season however it as always been consistent. I would recommend making reservations especially during the winter since the place is very small"}
{"text":"Ate here again yesterday at lunch! Solid menu and helpful, friendly staff.  The patio is sweet but noisy these days with all the construction around.  Try the fish tacos!  go for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Terrible service, restaurant was too cold, main waitress was rude and wait time for food was more than 30 minutes."}
{"text":"1)Delious food 2)good place for large party, book in advance 3)some waiters dont want to be there  and it shows, others are really great"}
{"text":"We had reservation for Sunday brunch, but we didn't get a table bcz the rude lady who works at the bar told us we're 3 min late....That's  worst customer service or waitress I've ever experienced and it just ruined everyone's good mood on Sunday morning ... There're a bunch of good brunch places around the area, ppl won't give u a shit if you serve them with shitty attitude!!!!"}
{"text":"I've had dinner on numerous occasions and never been disappointed...for the price, the food is consistently creative and delicious. I think it compares well with Messis on Harbord St...similar cool urban vibe, both have great patios... prices a little cheaper at Wish."}
{"text":"Wish is the kind of place to go if you feel like eating at a beach house.  It has that kind of vibe to it.  There isn't anything on the menu that I've tried and have been disappointed with.  The staff are all attentive and super accommodating.  I can't say enough good things about the employees."}
{"text":"First time at Wish was during winterlicous 2015. We arrived around 3 pm after the lunch crowd was gone on a Sunday. The service seemed impersonal, almost overwhelmed and too busy to acknowledge our presence. We asked for a table inside and it took some time for them to clean a table that was vacant.  I had the impression that the server was juggling too many tables at once.   The food was a gratefully a different experience. I had the African peanut soup with spiced chickpeas for appetizer.  So comforting. They were out of one of the main options and unable to provide us with an alternative so I had to pick the fish and chips and not the dish I was planning to order. It was a well executed dish but I'm not a big fan of deep fried food and unfortunately the fish itself had no flavour. The dessert was a superb lemon curd pie.  The ambiance was nice with a ton of personality. Perfect for a date. Portions were generous.  I would definitely come back hopefully during dinner time during the opening of the restaurant.  Maybe the service will be more attentive."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious 2016 and it was for $35. I had the pan seared steak with arugula, roasted rack of lamb and millefoglie. The portions were very generous and the meats were perfectly cooked. Not dry at all! The atmosphere was very cozy. Perfect decor for a date night! Highly recommended for winterlicious!"}
{"text":"Cold shoulder by manager (who could stand to lose a few pounds)  meets guests as they arrive.  Entree selection is limited.  One server for the entire restaurant ensures very slow service,  Patrons opening complaining about slow service destroys what little ambiance Wish ever had to offer.  Could not do worse at McDonald's"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend on a Wednesday.  it is very cute and close to the subway at a good location.  The service is very slow.  We waited for about 7 minutes for anyone to ask our drink orders and since we were both on our lunch breaks we ordered our food right away.  It took almost 30 minutes for our food to come out; we both ordered sandwiches so I'm not sure why it took so long.   The food is okay, but it isn't anything special considering you get get some AMAZING food in the area for way less money and for way less time.    I've heard their brunch is good, so I may give this place another shot however I will never go back for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is cute, and has a farm to table comfort food restaurant kind of feel. I just wish the food was up to par. Came here for dinner on Thursday night.  I had the Rare Duck Breast, Cannellini beans, olives, tomato, kale, orange segment with a red wine and blood orange reduction. I was pretty disappointed, the duck was not rare, it was more like medium, the fat was hardly rendered out, that is like french cooking 101 man, render the fat off duck breast to make skin crispy. The skin of course was soggy. The beans were hard and dry, not great at all, I expected creamy yummy beans. The rest of the components in this dish was alright.   My hubs had the lamb shank and it was alright, it was tender but a little dry as well. The rest of our party of about 11 found the food ok. The portion sizes at this place is relatively small, it is definitely a place where you need to order appetizer and a main to be full.  The bread was ok, it is a roll served with hummus, good because I was starving, but nothing special.  The server was friendly, but overall service was kind of slow, we waited quite a while for our food (more than 30mins). Of course, it maybe because our party was so large and they needed to wait for all the dishes to be ready, so that is not totally inexcusable, but still, if you are hungry, know that you will be waiting.  Overall, I do not love this place, if I want similar food at this price range, I will probably go to Bodega."}
{"text":"I discovered this place back when I lived a block away and I have been recommending this place since. I just love the décor, the vibe and the general environment, it's soo pretty, even the patio is adorable! The patio is open year round and is of course heated in the winter, warm enough to wear a t-shirt. The food is okay, the Dulce de Lèche cheesecake is delicious, the hot chocolate is good, and the cocktails are great too! The service is also very friendly.  This is the perfect place for a girls night out or a date!! =)"}
{"text":"What a lousy service.  There was an empty table but they just said stand their and the policy is to wait 10 minutes any way.  So rude and inefficient.  Great policy."}
{"text":"Good food for brunch, but a generally unpleasant experience due to service. I felt incredibly rushed the entire time by my server who was frankly rude at times. I can't understand the appeal of a place like this with such poor service."}
{"text":"This restaurant supports racism. My wife and I are of Indian decent, we went for dinner on Wednesday and there was a really loud table on one side of us (four people). They were so loud that the table to our other side actually paid for their drinks and left the restaurant. We complained to our server who asked them to quieten down. They were quiet for a few minutes then they started speaking loudly again, to which one of them said \"we better be quiet otherwise team Brampton will complain\". I took severe offence to this and questioned them about it, one of the friends said they were referring to them as they live in Brampton. I complained to staff and specifically said \"they are racist\" and they did nothing. Clearly this restaurant will serve anyone, even racists, they should have asked those guests to leave. Very disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"Second and last visit.    Walked in recently on a Sunday morning at about 11:30 for brunch. Place was at about half capacity with more than a few open tables. Asked a server if we could grab one of the three open tables on the patio and was told in a huff that we needed to go inside to arrange that. Ok fine. Went inside and asked for a table on the patio. The guy looked confused like we had just asked him what the meaning of life was. The first server then calls inside that we tried to just sit down at a table and that she told us to go inside. Then the guy tells us we needed a reservation. Huh? Who makes reservations to eat bacon and eggs on a Sunday morning in a half empty diner? Not this guy. We left confused and hungry. See ya Wish."}
{"text":"Reserved a table on Friday @ 1:30, arrived @ 1:20 and didn't sit in until 1:45(the girl kept telling us they're cleaning the table since we arrived & it took them 25mins to CLEAN it). Waited another 15min until someone noticed our table(tried to make eye contact, quietly hand-up for 5 min because no one showed up at our table). Two waiters came, said that \"we don't answer table, we come when we got time & we're busy\", we explained to the 2nd waiter that we waited 15min for literally anyone to come to our table, and the waiter said \"we're busy, you just wait for your service, your food & your drink\", no apology made at all, then he pushed us to order. We get that WISH has limited capacity & it's very popular, but seriously if you can't serve that many customers you shouldn't take all those reservations at all. Food came @ 14:15, fair, no ketchup for the potatoes.  Environment 3 star We sat beside the bar & was cold. Felt lucky that we didn't sit at the patio.   Food & Drink 2 stars Breakfast * 2 eggs over well-edge was burned, yolk not fully cooked, not seasoned(no salt on the table) * Tomato: burned * Bacon: 3 tiny pieces * Potatoes: a lot * Toast: one piece * 2 pieces of melon & 1 thin piece of grapefruit Benedict * Eggs-over cooked * 2 pieces of melon & 1 thin piece of grapefruit(which my friend is allergic to, the waiter never asked about any allergies when we ordered the food) Earl Grey * No milk/cream served(I didn't even bother ask for) * Only one small pot of how water served, no refill & costs 4 dollars  Service 1 star Besides how we were treated before food was served, the waiter showed up 3 times at the table besides us to pick up the plates they finished, he never bothered check up on our table(which is kinda funny because he stood right beside our table every single time & you know how tiny this cafe is if you ever came before, and all he needed to do was turning his noble head 45 degrees to the right). The bill came fast after we asked & wasn't separated(again he never asked & left right after he dropped the bill). The waiter accidentally took the credit card & give it back & dropped on the bill instead of handed over.  None of them ever asked if we need anything, if the food was good, was everything alright, etc. It wasn't crowded after 14:20 and empty tables were showing up, but yet, no one came to our table to serve or check up on us. We don't know the waiter's name since he never introduced himself. Rude, pushy, impatient. Not a single smile to us, no apology made nor a simple \"thank you\" after we finished the meal & paid the bill.  We were really looking forward to have brunch at WISH and were aware of how popular this place is. But honestly, we'll not return in the future and truly regret that we even came this time. There are many wonderful brunch places in town and none of them ever disappointed me by their service. This is the first time I ever wrote such a long comment about a restaurant because me and my friend had such an awful experience, such a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Should have a reservation if you want to have a brunch here. This place is cute. My seat on the patio was too cold even though there is a heater. Food was ok. I like their salmon burger. Tbh, good for pictures of instagram."}
{"text":"Just got home from here so I figured I would review while it is fresh in my mind.  Really cute place that is good for hanging out.  Slip covers on the seats were a bit ripped and dingy looking but honestly seemed fine.  Patio seemed like it would be great for brunch and people watching on a clear day.  It was a bit warm in there like other post said but we opened the door for a bit of breeze and it was ok.  So food - Bread and hummus brought to the table was good and a nice change. I had the penne arrabiata and to be honest it was terrible - it was so bland and heavy, honestly I have had better sauce out of a can.  For dessert we had the banana creme brûlée and it was good but a little weird, the filling was cold which I don't think I have ever experienced.  Buuuuuut, service was great.  Our waitress was really attentive and came as our drinks were done but never interrupted our convo.  Speaking of drinks they are phenomenal! I had the Wish Sidecar 5/5, French Water 5/5 (but strong earl grey flavour so probably not everyones taste) and the Moscow Mule 4/5. I also tasted my friends drinks, she had the Tina 4/5, the Hemingway 5/5 and the Manhattan Cosmo 3/5 (way too boozy and the garnish, well we couldn't tell if they were cherries or olives - not something you want to be confused on)  All in all, I would come back but only for the drinks and maybe for a few apps."}
{"text":"The food here is off the hook good ! Atmosphere is great and very unique.  Service is very good (but it wasn't busy) Had a jerked pork tenderloin stuffed with sweet potatoes black beans and goats cheese and a cream corn soufflé type side which was fantastic. Wifey had scallops with wasabi mashed potatoes which also were fantastic.  This restaurant has restored my faith in Toronto fair.  Only complaint , give your wine list a makeover need more Spanish, California and even Ontario wines on that puppy.   ( also Great people watching available from a very tastefully decor'd patio)"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday, wasn't too busy and they had a nice covered patio seating area which is really comfortable.   Good was good and they had pretty good drinks as well. I would come back as it is a really nice place to relax and take your time. Which is perfect because the restaurant isn't too busy you do not feel rushed to get out."}
{"text":"I came pretty late for Saturday brunch with a friend. We were told the wait would be approximately 45 minutes but we got lucky and ended up with a table in 15 minutes. We ordered the egg florentine and eggs in purgatory. I love that the florentine is served with a parmesan fondue instead of a typical hollandaise sauce. The eggs in purgatory is similar to a shashuka and the stew is very flavourful. The portions are generous and both my friend and I did not finish our plates. Service wise, our waiter was very friendly and always made sure we were ok.  The decor is very cute and there's a small heated outdoor patio but I have never sat at before."}
{"text":"I went for wish for brunch with a few of my friends and I was beyond pleased. I made a reservation prior and got seated right away. my waiter was very quick and checked on us frequently. The food was delicious and all of me and my friends were very satisfied. the location of the restaurant is perfect!!"}
{"text":"Went here for Summerlicious and was pleasantly surprised.  Warm lentil salad was tasty, the piri piri chicken delicious and for dessert the chocolate key lime tart was a phenomenal mixing of sweet and tart.  Had a glance at the regular menu and definitely want to go back and try some more.   The restaurant is small and the patio quite closed in, so if someone's smoking it's in your face no matter where you're sitting."}
{"text":"Cool spot for martinis and brunch. It has an old English cottage feel. Wood painted white. Patio has canvas covering and blasts heat in the winter. Truthfully one of my favourite spots. Always busy for weekend  brunch. Cute young waiters. Evening meals are better than Toronto \"pub\" food but still fit in with Toronto's voluminous mediocre food. Open late so if you are a Brass Rail perv you can head over here with a dancer late at night. Owners also own Smith and 7 West and previously owned now-closed Maison. They definitely have contributed, in a good way, to Toronto's late night experience. Go girls!"}
{"text":"Delightful cafe with unexpectedly charming decor, steps from the hustle and bustle of Yonge and Bloor! Met a girlfriend for a leisurely lunch and we both enjoyed a glass of wine and our food very much. Will be back when I am in TO again in the future."}
{"text":"Food: 9/10 Atmosphere: 8.5/10  Service: 8.4/10 Overall experience: 9/10  I went to Wish for brunch with a friend on a colder fall morning. We were seated outside (heated \"patio\") which was a bit chilly but made better with the fluffy white blankets and comfy couches you got to sit on!  I had the Croque Madam which was wonderful! It hit the spot with the perfect amount of egg, ham and carb...I mean cheese.   My girlfriend had the challah french toast which was also good. Not quite up to par with the Croque Madam but I find it's because those types of dishes (french toast, panckaes, waffles) become less of a wow dish after a few bites since it is all the same flavour.   The decor in general is lovely. Very feminine - a type of place I would not mind having a ladies brunch or bridal party at.   THE BOTTOM LINE: fantastic Croque Madam in a lovely girly setting."}
{"text":"(Jan 23, 2016. around 8 pm)My sister and I decided to have dinner at Wish, she has been there before and told me the food was good.  When I first entered, this placed looked cute. But unfortunately our female server was very rude.  The indoor patio was not busy, only had 2 tables occupied.  I asked her if it was possible to sit at one of the corner table instead of sitting beside the door because we were getting cold. She snapped back and said \"THE TABLES NEED TO BE CLEANED AND I'M NOT SURE IF U CAN SIT THERE BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT TAKE IT\"... THIS MADE DID NOT SENSE TO ME... (I have been in the service industry as bartender and server for 10 years and i would never treat anyone like that!) So we sat in the cold for over 25 minutes without anything to drink. She did not even bothered to ask if we wanted anything to drink or eat. I WAS JUST SO SHOCKED AND DISAPPOINTED AT THIS SERVER.. SO WE LEFT AND HAD DINNER SOMEWHERE ELSE WHICH HAD AMAZING FOOD AND SERVICE"}
{"text":"Incredibly rude staff, food was not worth the service at all. Host was rude and we waited a long time to be seated. Wait staff was disinterested and rushed."}
{"text":"Wish is a small trendy little spot tucked away on Charles. The all white decor looks awesome and the wonderful little patio is perfect for hanging out.  This is a great place for a date! Service was fairly prompt and the drinks were good. I hear this place has great sangria that I still need to try.  We ordered the calamari which unfortunately wasn't as good as the drinks. Freezer calamari, batter in chunky bits sliding off... It just wasn't good.  I don't want to judge the place based our one appetizer...   I'll be back for drinks on the cute patio... and maybe I'll give other menu items a shot."}
{"text":"The Good of Wish:  1. Decor. It's a bit strange, but it works for the vibe they are trying to give off. 2. Patio. It's one of the only restos in Toronto with an all year round patio with lots of heating. 3. Food. They have quite a few things to choose from and I have not been disappointed there yet.  Recommended dish: Greek yogurt parfait (brunch!) You'll be pleasantly surprised.  The Bad of Wish  1. Service. While it's not horrible, usually it's too busy for the small staff they have and you get forgotten about (especially our last visit!). I had to actually go and get a waiter to clear our items and grab our bill. 2. Reservations. You will be asked if you have a reservation when you walk in and then they will act like they'll try to squeeze you in. I'm not a fan of this tactic, so last time we were going we actually tried to make reservations - when we were told they do not take reservations with less than 24hrs notice.  Not huge things and you will most likely have a good time. Sit on the patio - the decor is very interesting and if you're lucky you will get a couch!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"In terms of the food, I found brunch delicious, especially their poached eggs. Just the way the egg yolk oozes out, perfection. It was balanced and seasoned well. I ordered the Florentine (poached eggs over wilted spinach and parmesan fondue) and had no complaints. My party also ordered Charlotte (poached eggs over smoked salmon with leek and parmesan fondue) and Benedict Poached Eggs which they enjoyed. Presentation was great.  I would say it's a bit expensive for $15, however that appears to be standard fare for brunch in this area. The place is quite quaint and hipster (no surprise given the area). There are very few tables (some in their outside patio area which is nice), best in small parties of 2-6. Service was good.  I think the major con would be it's very packed/wait is long because it's reservation based (as a walk-in we were dependent on no-shows from reservations). I was also not that happy they charged $1.00 for hot water with a lemon wedge (just because it comes in a fancy teapot and cup does not classify that as an upscale drink)."}
{"text":"Super busy place, waited for half an hour and table was not ready for another 20mins. Food was served very slowly. The results of slow service are obvious, fries were very soft and the cheese became rubbery .However, to be fair, the burger was cooked to perfection.  There are also very loud groups of ladies. So if you are looking for a nice place to enjoy, avoid the busy time or book a reservation."}
{"text":"Honestly, great food and pretty aesthetic but poor service. Really puts a damper on the whole experience."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and left on a positive note. It was a cute date spot in downtown Toronto; the ambient of the place was beautiful with a cozy patio. I ordered the \"Wish fried chicken club\" with a side salad and it was delicious; highly recommend to order this dish.   Even though the restaurant was surprisingly busy, my server was pleasant and attentive. I felt like they were understaffed - so expect delays. The place was smaller than I had anticipated, so there wasn't a lot of seating available; I highly recommend making reservations.   Overall, I had a pleasant experience at Wish."}
{"text":"My experience was awful, and I will not return again.  1) I made a brunch reservation for 2 people at noon. We arrived on time, and let the hostess know (who was more like a do-it-all). She did not take our name, and told us that our table was being prepared. I noticed that there were many walk-in parties waiting as well. However, for the next 30 mins, they seated the walk-ins and repeatedly told us that \"we would be next\". By the time we were seated, it was 12:35 pm, and I was left to wonder what the purpose was of making a reservation, when walk-ins are given priority.  2) We were seated around the same time as two other parties of 2 (which, by the way, were walk-ins that arrived after us). We ordered 5-10 minutes before these two parties, and actually received our food 15 mins after them. We ordered exactly the same dishes as the other tables, and yet for some reason, ours came out much later.  3) We were seated in the patio section, which would have been fine if there was a heater. I've been to Wish in previous months, where the heater was turned on and worked. Given that it was extremely cold outside, it would have been thoughtful to keep patrons warm. By the end of the meal, my feet were frozen.  4) The only redeeming fact is that the food at Wish is good. Not amazing by any means, but good and better than average. Otherwise, everything was just awful."}
{"text":"The location is the best thing about Wish. The service was so bad and unfriendly that we left before ordering mains. It took over 30 minutes to get black coffee that was weak and cold. When I mentioned that the coffee wasn't even warm, the server just shrugged and said it was fine. We paid for our coffee and left."}
{"text":"I went here for a random dinner with my boyfriend. The place was cozy and trendy. We did not make reservations, but the server was very friendly. I suggest making reservations and requesting a spot on the patio because it looked amazing! However, we were unable to have a seat there as it was booked for a mini wedding!  My boyfriend had a black angus beef burger while I had fish and chips. The food was tasty. They don't have a dessert menu. When I ordered, she came a slice of chocolate cake that seemed to be bought from a store. It was not worth $8.   I'm a big dessert fan and I would not suggest this place for dessert. However, the food was great overall and the servers were nice!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place winter through summer. Patio area is open all year and just enclosed /heated during colder months of course. This place has so much potential and unfortunately the quality of their food simply did not match up. Highly overpriced and food and service was mediocre at best. Had quite a few items on their lunch menu between my partner and I, but nothing special. Great for pics, not great for your taste buds. Do not plan on going back, I would suggest going once to see the cute ambiance of the place- but definitely wouldn't hype it up or recommend this to someone off the bat."}
{"text":"The inside is super cute and their heated patio is just lovely. Your only chance of having brunch here though is if you make a reservation in advance, and even then you might still have to wait like we did because the place is so small. I had the Florentine eggs Benedict and it was good. The home fries were delicious. It's good but nothing mind blowing that deserves the high prices. There are better cheaper brunch places with great ambiance in Toronto. But it might be worth it to try Wish at least once to satisfy the curiosity over all the hype this place has gotten."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed to say that the service I got today at Wish was unbelievably bad. We got seated and waited for 15 minutes just for the waiter to come to our table. Nobody acknowledged us. The waiter walked by our table so many times without acknowledging us at all. The worst part is when we paid for our bill, he was standing with his arms crossed in front of us and looking very impatient. Very unpleasant attitude. Completely ruined our night. I had a good impression about Wish before, as I always go to this restaurant at least twice a week. But Today's experience really made me not wanna revisit again."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, however the service was not very good. Our waiter was very slow and did not seem to care about our table at all. Took multiple times to try and get his attention before he would even come over. Drinks took 15 minutes."}
{"text":"I had heard rave reviews about Wish and decided to make a reservation for Sunday brunch, which was my first mistake. After arriving with a small group at this cute little restaurant, I gave my name, but was warned by the customer ahead of us in line that reservations don't mean a thing at Wish. She was right: we proceeded to wait 45 minutes to be seated. As for an explanation, the manager couldn't get her story straight. She told me that our table was being set up and would be ready any minute, while another person reported she had said (moments later) that our table was still occupied and they couldn't kick out other patrons, even if they were taking forever to pay. In truth, they were overbooked and understaffed. When we finally got to our table, there was no apology or acknowledgement of the situation or how long we had to wait, even with a reservation. The food (which, unsurprisingly, took forever to arrive) was decent but not worth the headache and certainly not the best brunch I've had in Toronto. We all left with the impression that because Wish is so trendy, they don't care about providing any actual service. You feel like you're just a number, which is surprising for such a cozy, intimate space. I know that brunch places can easily get overwhelmed on Sundays but if the staff had acted like they cared and not like they were doing us a favour, it would have made a difference. Also, be warned, if you're seated in the front part of the restaurant, it will be so noisy that you can hardly hear the people you're with. What you can hear exceptionally well is the bell chiming from the kitchen and cooks yelling orders to each other, but I'm assuming it's a deliberate attempt to be edgy. Go elsewhere for better food and way better service."}
{"text":"Food quality was adequate. I ordered the black bean burger and it was not worth it's $19 price tag.  Our seats were on the covered patio and the decor was nice but it didn't particularly make up for the cons. Won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Wish has the kind of patio where you walk by once, do a double-take and say, \"Whoa, I gotta eat here.\" Except in my case, I've walked by countless times and only recently did I finally get a chance to experience brunch here.  Got here Saturday afternoon and there was a line, no surprise. Thought we weren't going to get a table but... Plot twist! We made a reservation. Write that down, folks. Brunch 101.  We ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict to share. It was also hard to resist the blueberry and caramelized bananas french toast on the menu so we got one of those too. Eggs benny was good, nothing special but it met expectations. French toast looked mouthwatering, especially after drizzling maple syrup over it with little restraint... Needless to say, we filled up easily with these two dishes.  The food here is pretty good, although not mindblowing. It definitely ranks higher in my books though because of the atmosphere. Tip from me? Add this to your list of great date spots. It's on mine. ;)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere here and food are decent but the experience was ruined by terrible service. Both our servers were tools who seemed to be irritated to be doing their jobs, in fact at times they were straight up rude.. rolling their eyes when we asked for a new plate. Definitely left here with a bad taste in my mouth from this. So spare yourself if you want to be treated like a human being."}
{"text":"Today my friend and I went for lunch to wish. The prices are reasonable, the food portions are huge! It was delicious but a bit oily for my taste.I prefer healthier stuff... Maybe my fault, next time I will not order fish and chips... Beautiful environment and it was fully packed. I recommend this restaurant for sure. We did not order drinks as we had to go back to work, so can't comment on that."}
{"text":"Completely over priced! Okay food but not mind blowing."}
{"text":"I wish I had read the reviews about bad customer service at this place before I decided to go there. (That's why you can't just trust Instagram posts.) The waitress (who seems to be the manager?) was really rude and bitchy. We made a reservation at 11:30am and we got there at 11:42am. She told us that they would only hold a table for 10 mins past reservation time, and since we got there 2 minutes after that, they had already given our table to someone else. We didn't want to argue with her so we just asked her how long we had to wait for another table. She seemed really annoyed, and said she'd go find out. We looked around and saw at least 5 unoccupied tables. She returned in a few minutes and told us that we had to wait for at least 20 minutes. We were really pissed off by her attitude so we left and went to another restaurant near by. Seriously she acted as if we owed her money or something. Will never return in a million years."}
{"text":"Love the decor and atmosphere. Haven't had food yet but the dessert was okay. The drinks are reasonably priced. The service is passable but not superb"}
{"text":"Ok came back to update my review to 1 star down from 2. Below I copy and paste the passive aggressive private message I received from my waiter that day at wish. The message was about 7-8 paragraphs long so needless to say I won't bother with it ALL. Mind you, other reviewers have complained about this same waiter too but call me crazy:  He started off my apologizing. Then dissected my complaints with defensive remarks about what was clearly a miscommunication between us (him as our server and us as the patrons). I get that but this message clearly summarizes this servers attitude. I'm not looking to get into a massive dialogue but of course believe that businesses and waiters should have their fair chance to reply. However, managers should reach out and not the specific staff. It makes it appear challenging and combative because my experience was as such directly because of the service you provided - how then can u make me feel better about it without defending yourself.  Below are some excerpts:    \"In your review you mention a number of issues that you had with me and my service but these issues were never addressed as they occurred. In the future I would highly recommend having a more open dialogue with servers as in this case I was truly unaware that you were having such a bad experience. In the handful of times I came over to the table to check in no complaints were addressed.\" - right ... so you can spit in my food? This server ABSOLUTELY looked like he would spit in my food - my friend and I both agreed on that. After receiving this passive aggressive message I am even more certain he would have done something to my meal had I sent it back or complained. I was just dying to get outta that place.   \"In regards to the seating I did not feel it was unreasonable to ask you and your friend to remain at a table for two rather than taking a table for four.  As far as moving your items from the next time I often find that people feel uncomfortable when they notice that someone has to move there stuff so that they can have a seat. I was just trying to avoid that.\" - that is perfectly fine. Thank you for explaining yourself. Well, we certainly saved those imaginary customers the embarrassment (no one ever sat next to us btw for the rest of our meal) but the point is the server made ME feel uncomfortable but dryly asking me to remove my back as though I had not bothered to read the rules of the establishment posted somewhere. Lets not forget that this is MY review about MY experience not some contingent patron who may or may not take a seat at the table next to me. So good on you, those imaginary patrons would have loved your support and thoughtfulness. All this said to me is that me as a physical patron there, my experience and needs were less important than another guest who may join us later. He makes it sound like he was such a sweet little lamb when in fact he had a steely cold personality and simply asked me to move my things. Wasn't apologetic or thoughtfull like he makes it sound.    \"As far as the bill splitting goes I was a little confused by what you were asking of me and thought it was best to split the bills as I didn't really understand your directions. To then say I made a \"fuss\" and \"hurried off\" makes it sound as though I threw a fit when truly I was just splitting them because I was unsure of what you wanted. I am human and make mistakes. And in this case I got confused by the directions and am not sure why that was held against me. What did I gain by splitting them?\" - I don't even know what this paragraph was explaining but a simple sorry goes a long way or you should have asked me for clearer instructions if you didn't understand what I asked for. The server makes it sound as though I was completely ruthless and unsympathetic to a poor guy just doing his job when the truth was far from that. He was snobby, not chatting or warm and this is why we had a communication break down. Obviously all due to a rough start with asking me to move my items from the other table.   \"I hope you read this message in the tone it was intended. I am addressing specific complaints not to be combative but instead to try and shed light on some of the details that made your experience so negative. An opportunity which unfortunately I was not given the chance to do on your visit. Like I said I have been at Wish for a long time and really do care about it and was really upset by your review and knowing I was the cause of such a bad experinece which could have easily been resolved or avoided.\" The MOST passive aggressive part of his message. \"I'm not trying to fight but really I am trying to put you in your place\" is what I read. All in all a simple sorry would have gone a long way. I wish I never went to wish. I also wish I could now have the last 15 mins of my life back which I spent on updating this review."}
{"text":"Wish is a cozy seated, elegant nook and perfect for a date or dinner.  Food is excellent, very charming... Brunch is tremendous"}
{"text":"After coming across this shabby-chic gem on Instagram my girl gang and I decided to head north off of our usual Queen West spots and check out a new neighbourhood.   Wish was certainly the spot to be in the area. The small restaurant was filled with warmth, comforting smells and laughter on a Saturday morning. We walked in and the hostess ask us if we had reservations, I was shocked that such a place would accept reservations on a busy Saturday brunch...so good to know for next time and highly recommend to make. She admitted it was an hour and half wait. For some reason I had a gut feeling (or just starvation) that it wouldn't take that long, we decided to stay and lucked out on three seats at the small bar. Within 25 minutes we were placed at a table! We were seated by the main outside door, with people coming and going often we asked to change tables. The one we wanted was reserved but if they didn't show we could have it... and just our luck, again, they didn't show!   There are two main areas for seating inside and then outside on a covered patio. They make good use of the space by having heat lamps for the colder months without neglecting the patio space.   All of us, ordered the Florentine... because leek and parmesan fondue how could we not? It was a step up from the average eggs benedict. I requested some hot sauce and they legit came over with an old wooden toolbox complete with dozens of hot sauce options, which just blew me away. As for a cocktail we had \"Tina\" muddled raspberries and prosecco. No better way to start a girl's day!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation a week in advance and still had to wait 40 min for a table. No apology or thank you for waiting by the hostess once I was finally sat. Plus she gave me a table inside and I only went there for the patio. Maybe you should have asked me my preference of where i wanted to sit before you made me wait 40 minutes after my reservation time. Too expensive for a terrible experience, will never come back. Too many other restaurants in Toronto. Don't waste your time. Only giving 2 stars for the carrot pancakes and our nice server."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks last night. Decent but overpriced cocktails. Meh kinda service. Weird decor"}
{"text":"In the immortal words of Homer Simpson, \"I wish, I wish, I hadn't killed that fish\" though in this instance replace \"killed that fish\" with \"gone to wish\".  I've been to wish twice now. I had fond memories of the first visit until the second I stepped in the door yesterday and remembered how horrendous the service was.  So let's go over the issues other people won't tell you. People tell you the food is amazing. Wrong. You're telling me that you can't toast 2 pieces of rye, smash some freezing avocado on top of that and then place an over poached egg as the rotten cherry on top? If you can't do that you may have larger problems that finding a place to eat.  People will tell you it's \"so quaint\". Wrong again jerks! It's ill conceived if anything. Oh a porch with swinging doors! That's a great idea in the middle of the fucking winter. Next!!!  There's unlimited coffee. Nope. There's unlimited luke warm coffee. By the way they have this everywhere but you know...rule of threes.  Now, onto my real beef, the service. 1. If I make a reservation at 1:30 and I'm not seated till 1:45, you fucked up. 2. If I say \"my eggs are a bit over cooked\" the best response probably isn't, \"well, you didn't say you wanted them cooked runny\". FYI, they're poached eggs!!!! They're runny!!! 3. When 2 other tables seated after my group then eat and leave before my food has arrived don't tell me that it's because \"your order takes longer\". Especially don't follow it up with \"I just rushed your order\" when you said it was being played 15 minutes ago!   If you leave here with nothing else it should be this:  Wish has passable food but they're all assholes."}
{"text":"So I finally decided to try Wish after living / working in the surrounding areas for years. I must say I was truly impressed.The design and decor made me want to stays forever. Service was fast friendly and on point. I orderd mussels and my friend order the crab cake. My drink was mixed perfectly, Thanks Bartender . Our server was very attentive without being overbearing. I will definitely be back to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Located on a side street off Yonge, about 2-3 mins walk from Bloor-Yonge station. As you enter the first thing you notice is a giant planter partially obstructing the entrance, which is really odd. So you have to skirt around it to walk through the front door.  Not the most welcoming of places. The space itself is very lovely and rustic with cushy seats and comfy pillows.   Once I was in, I just stood around because none of the staff actually made eye contact with me. So there I stood awkwardly for a bit while staff bustled around me, serving food, placing orders until someone finally acknowledged me.  I gave her the name of the table I was with and got a blank stare in return, followed by confusion until a second staff member intervened and figured out where my table was and walked me over.  I'm hungry and uncaffeinated, so not off to a great start at all.   Most of my party had already arrived, and our server came right over to ask me if I wanted something to drink. I ordered a mimosa which was brought over promptly, and once the rest of our table arrived we ordered immediately. I opted for the Charlotte (smoked salmon benny) which was served with a side of potatoes and fresh fruit.  The Parmesan fondue on the Benny was delicious. A few people ordered the regular benny and it came with very generous portions of peameal bacon - wow! The food was served promptly as well.   Our server was also great - really attentive considering how busy it was and the fact that we were a big group. There was a bit of a mix up towards the end when we were splitting bills, but we were a big group, and I was full of yummy food therefore in a very forgiving mood.   Not sure I would return to be honest. There's just better breakfast spots in the downtown area, but honestly, minus the first 10 minutes of my experience it was mostly enjoyable."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for a drink, ended up staying for dinner, I had the turkey burger with a salad. Love love loved it. (the only turkey burger that I like better is Bannock's) Salad was lovely and fresh with grapefruit placed on top. Service was terrific, we never felt ignored, the waiter showed up as soon as our wine glass became empty.  Will definitely be back, if only for the burger."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and a good portion! I thought that the atmosphere was great and perfect spot for brunch. The waiter was very nice and during cold days they also have heaters for the shielded outdoor areas! It is pretty small though so often times you have to wait, but I didn't have to wait for too long"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for dinner and once for brunch.  Dinner- Overpriced and didn't deliver at all. I don't like going to restaurants and being left with the feeling that I could have just made the same dish myself at home.   Brunch- I still felt like I paid more than what the meal actually deserved, but it was adequate considering it's prime location and cute decor.   One thing that bothered me was when I asked for hot water, they charged me $1 and it tasted like rust from the electric pot."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely lovely brunch on Saturday.  I love the outdoor/indoor seating and the white and blue decor.  What made me the most happy was the delicious food!  They have a great tea selection and my Eggs Florentine with leek and cheese fondue?  It was to die for.  And it came with fruit and potatoes.    The service was okay.  Sometimes it felt like we were approached too many times, and then at other points our server was gone for a while.  Also, their wireless was being a bit wonky.  But, they let us stay for a long time after we finished eating and overall it was an enjoyable Saturday brunch."}
{"text":"Came here for a sat brunch birthday with a group of 12! Excellent service! Love the decor! Price is on the higher side and they charge $20 for cake cutting. Ordered the French toast and coffee and it came to $25.21 with tip and tax.   Food - food portions are really big. Came with four pieces of French toast. The sticky wish syrup was really good and caramelized bananas. The other dishes looked pretty good too, esp the egg benny.   Atmosphere and decor - this place is so cute. There is a small outdoor heated patio which doesn't really fit large groups.   Service - excellent service here even for large groups which I know are hard to accommodate. We had really wanted to sit outside on the heated patio but our group was too big so they couldn't seat us there. Nonetheless, our original group of 11 turned into 12 and the staff quickly accommodated us by moving some furniture around. They also gave us separate bills."}
{"text":"Good, intimate spot if you don't mind spending $30CAN on breakfast for one.  Well located west of Church near the gay village.  The menu is small but manageable. I choose the grill cheese on rye with bacon an egg over easy on the side. The meal was perfect and came with a side of potatoes and fruit. The double expresso was bold and just what I needed.  The service was also good although I felt I would get in trouble if I asked for ketchup.  If your on a budget skip it, other then that go ahead and enjoy a good breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"I went here for a lunch meeting in winter time. I can't wait to try out the outdoor seating in the spring/summertime.  The place is trendy, and you won't find students or many non-wealthy people as it is certainly not cheap.  We went for lunch and for an entree paid between $12-$15 per person, without drink or dessert.  But the ambiance is very lovely and the place is so neat! It's located right in the heart of the city and all of it's furnishings are white which makes it very trendy. Not only that, but every table has 2 seats on one side (okay, big deal) and ONE WHITE COUCH on the other.  The way it's shaped, not my fav-esp for winter as you hang your coat on a rack but since there isn't a lot of room, trying to squeeze into the hallway to get out, without hitting people with your jacket or knocking over the wine bottle holder (like I did, luckily no wine inside) takes some serious concentration.   The fries are excellent, thin, crispy and if you ask they'll give you a buttery garlicy condiment alongside.  The 3 decker grilled-cheese is not quite cheesy enough, but still delish and the spinach salad with carmelized pecans and pears (and some strong cheese whose name I have forgotten) is very nice, but I admit on it's own, not that big (and it's $13).   They were out of regular condiments such as vinegar for the fries (they offered balsalmic vinegar....for fries?!) and mineral water.  But, oh well, it was still yummy and I felt important dining there, being surrounded by highfalutin peeps."}
{"text":"Average food, good service, nice patio, excellent place for a girl's night lol.  I went there on Saturday evening with two of my girlfriends. Honestly speaking, it is a great spot for taking photos and post them on SNS. What a cute patio, with pink kettle and adorable hydrangeas!  The garlic lemon parmesan mushroom skillet tastes good. The refreshing lemon aroma is quite attractive when coming to the table. Mushroom is always my favourite and this dish is also my type. The crab cake is quite good as well. And I believe this is the most authentic crab cake I've had recently because of the generous crab meat inside. This is the first time for me to try some patatas bravas sauce, very interesting flavour but I like it. I have to say the side with the crab cake is outstanding, yes, charred shishito peppers. They are finely grilled with just simple seasoning, spicy and surprisingly delicious. The duck breast with risotto is also recommended! The texture of the duck meat is quite tender with very good flavour. The risotto is perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Cute interior and decor! Felt like I was whisked off to the south of France while I was there.  I came for Saturday brunch and ordered the turkey burger, which comes with a side of home fries. The burger was huge--the only way you could eat it was with a knife and fork--and costed $17. It was tasty.  Service was great, and I really like their lemon infused water and the cute glass jar they use for milk.   The brunch menu wasn't very inspiring, with choices I'd find at any typical brunch place. I wouldn't make a special trip to eat at Wish, but its decor is really cute!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places for brunch. The French toast is delicious as is their \"eggs in purgatory,\" which is more or less shakshuka with Scarmorza cheese, served with three pieces of grilled bread. Another favourite on their menu is the Nutella sandwich! Reservations are highly recommended for this place!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable and looks great in pictures! It seems like this place is always busy, especially for brunch so reservations is a must.   The food looks pretty and it tastes good but I wouldn't say it's anything amazing or something I would die to have again considering the high price tag.   Service was okay, nothing too memorable there..  Overall, the experience was good, but I think it's because the place is so darn cute and great for instagram."}
{"text":"Wish has been a restaurant that I've been meaning to visit and I finally got an opportunity to come for here for dinner during Winterlicious.  The front of the restaurant is very unique.  I walked in through the front door and immediately there was a small space with an outdoor patio area that had heaters.  Once we went into the restaurant, we were greeted by the bartender whom directed us to our seats.  The restaurant is very small but super cozy and everyone in there is very approachable and friendly.  We sat down and already knew what we were ordering from the Winterlicious menu.  For my appetizer, I choose the Prawns with onion, garlic, white wine, and fresh tomato, with pan grattato and feta and a glass of white wine.  I did enjoy my appetizer, it was very similar to bruschetta but with shrimp.  For my main dish, I choose the Mussels and frites - leek, tomato and white wine broth.  I thought my main dish was very flavourful and I didn't think I'd get full off the mussels and frites but they were very generous with their portion sizes.  For dessert, I had the Butterscotch tart, which was obviously delicious but heavy.  Some other dishes that were ordered by the table were the daily soup (which I didn't get good feedback from as they said it tasted like canned tomato soup), Turkey burger with radicchio, salsa verde, tomato and smoked provolone served with fries (The Turkey burger was apparently very delicious but it was also gigantic and extremely filling - let's just say everyone had left overs from the burger), Maple glazed roast salmon with caramelized cauliflower, fennel, herb lentils and mustard cream (which was good from the feedback I received) and the Old fashioned double chocolate cake (which wasn't anything special).   I'd say overall, the food was good, but I didn't think there was anything special or spectacular about the menu.  For the price of the Winterlicious menu, it's only worth it if you get the seafood dishes.  However, I did enjoy the overall experience of the restaurant and the service - other than a couple of loud/obnoxious women that had a cackling laugh. I would definitely come back for brunch as this is what Wish is known for and I will definitely come back in the summer as well to sit on the patio.  If you are planning to come on a weekend, I recommend you make reservations because by the time we left the restaurant on the Friday, it was completely packed."}
{"text":"I went to wish for a birthday party for dinner with a group of 15 people. Upon getting there we were seated in the back room and had a table set up for all of us. It was a bit chilly due to the cold outside and sitting right by the second set of doors but the place had a cute feel. The night went downhill where the food took around 3 hours to get delivered (due to each person's meal being served at different times). The drinks took about 45 mins each to receive due to our one poor server, who didn't have any food runners or help serving our big group. As a server myself, I have done this and understand it's not easy, especially with customers asking for things but in this case the managers should have clearly assigned help. The drinks which were about $13-15 each were good, however when my friend asked for extra olives for his martini he was told he'd be charged $2 extra. One of the guests who said his steak was undercooked, sent it back to get cooked slightly, only to be told the chef prepared itexactly how he asked and is a professional and would not be cooking it again. In the middle of our meal, the bouncer opened the second set of doors, right next to our table and allowed a couple to squeeze through in the space not big enough to fit a person directly next to our table and behind our chairs. Imagine someone walking directly into your meal, that's what it was like. After finally receiving the bills, we had a charge of $1 for a hot water with lemon. I understand it takes a lot of work to prepare this, and as a server I have done it many times, but it's no different than getting free pop refills or refilling waters at the table. This is part of a server's job. When we spoke to the manager, they were able to bring some bottles of Prosecco to the table, which was at that point half pregnant women.  The way this place is run, leaves a lot to be desired and I understand the managers get their comments from higher up, but for a place that's somewhat expensive it's shocking that they would act so cheap! Unfortunately I had high hopes for this restaurant, being a complete foodie but I would never return here."}
{"text":"I went today with my friend for brunch. We made a reservation earlier at 1:30pm. We arrived at Wish at 1:20pm and we waited for over 30min even we had a reservation. We asked waitress about five times and she relied every time like \"your table is almost ready, we are just cleaning it up\", the table cleaning took over 30min!?!? They could just tell us the table wasn't ready.   When we finally sat down, we waited over 15min without any waiters approaching us to take the order.  After we tried to make eye contact or wave at the waiters and they still didn't come. We had no choice but to keep our hands up the whole time, then first waiter came and said: you didn't have to do that. We don't raise hands there. And he disappeared. 5 min late, the second waiter showed up, I was complaining that we raised hands because no body was there to take our order. He was like, \"yeah we don't do that here. We are really busy you have to wait.\" I was trying to saying we have been waiting so long and what was the way to ask for a simple order then he just cut me off rudely saying: \"what do you want....\" I was really pissed off. They were really rude and after they took our order, they didn't come once after, refilling our water , asking if the food is OK and we had no cream or milk for our tea or ketchup for our potatoes.   Their food is not up to the standards. I ordered the egg benedict, it was like hard boiled egg. My friend's eggs and tomatoes were way overlooked. Beside so so food , their service is terrible and waiters are so rude I will never come back. It was a waste of my time, my money and it was an awful dining experience."}
{"text":"I wish I could get some salt with my eggs!    Understanding that the owners of 7 also own Wish, my expectation levels were set appropriately.    Unfortunately the experience did not measure up in any way.  Most notably the lack of attentive service.  Our waiter failed to bring out any sweetener options for my coffee and completely forgot my wife's request for ketchup for her breakfast potatoes.    During this entire time I'm waiting to eat my eggs because there's no salt to be found.  After he returned to ask how we were doing, we reminded him about the ketchup and asked for salt.  Unbelievably, we waited another 10 minutes for those items, which were finally brought out by a different waiter and now rendered moot since we'd finished our meals.  An unremarkable food experience tainted by poor service makes me say MEH!"}
{"text":"The food here is average and overpriced. However, that's not the reason this place deserves only one star. The service, and quite frankly, management at Wish are horrible. I accidentally left a shopping bag at my table last weekend and when I went back to pick it up, I caught one of their staff members going through my bag. To make things even worse, one of my personal items was missing from the bag and when I confronted the manager, he quickly dismissed me and said \"it must have fallen out.\" He never followed up with me later (after the restaurant had closed) as he had promised. Needless to say, I will not be returning to this place ever again nor will I be recommending it to any others. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch with friends. Goodness good, decor is cool and the champagne cocktail is perfect! Servers could definitely be more friendly though - we felt like an inconvenience to them while we were there."}
{"text":"I have to vent a bit here and I wish I didn't.  I desperately wanted to like, actually love Wish.  It has an amazing patio, is super trendy (love the white), and as one reviewer noted allows itself to be both trendy and somehow cozy simultaneously, a rare feat of restaurant engineering indeed.  But and it is a massive BUT, the service was awful.  I will briefly explain.    I recently had lunch here with my girlfriend and the food was decent, definitely passable without being memorable which is fine, yet I cannot forget, nor forgive the brutal massacre of service.  My GF ordered soup ( I don't' even remember what she ordered), but what I do remember is that midway through the soup she stopped eating and a frightened look suddenly masked her delicate features.  I noticed immediately and asked what was wrong.  She slowly worked something around in her mouth and proceeded to expel the offending object into a napkin.  Upon examination it appeared to be a large chunk of the soup bowl that had evidently been chipped before the soup had been served.  As we are both under the radar people and don't like to \"make scenes\" if you will we briefly contemplated whether to say anything.  I decided that we must.  She politely called our Server over and explained what had happened and even showed him the physical evidence.  He mumbled a brief \"sorry\" under his breath and made an exaggerated gesture in taking the half finished soup bowl from the table, as if we were somehow at fault for bringing it to his attention.  The soup was never replenished, nor were we even addressed until our bill was brought, which included the aforementioned SOUP!  My girlfriend asked what I wanted to do, and I decided that I would pay for the meal in its entirety, but that I refused with certainty to leave a tip of any kind.  I work in the service industry and it pains me greatly when I have to break the cardinal rule and turn my back on a fellow member of the tribe.  Yet I had no choice, for my hand had been forced.  Now I should mention that I have worked in kitchens and understand that this type of thing does happen.  However all a Server needs to do is explain to the kitchen what happened. grab a new soup, maybe some bread or a small appetizer, and potentially comp the soup.  Had he followed this basic service protocol he would have received a standard 15-20% tip and all would be forgotten.  I wish I didn't have to slam Wish, but I do, because something that was so simple was handled so inappropriately and at the end of the day people need to see that service is the backbone of everything.  And without solid service food, decor and level of perceived \"hipness\" matter not.  Wish clearly demonstartes this."}
{"text":"We headed here for a late night dessert and coffee fix taking a suggestion of the server from the restaurant we had dinner at (crazy, I know!)... but it was truly fabulous!  The decor and atmosphere was absolutely stunning - it was unlike any other restaurant I've seen (almost like it was a house first before it became Wish). The service was fantastic! She suggested we try the Chocolate Ganache Brownie with homemade raspberry compote. And WOW - I \"WISH\" this could be a daily indulgence! It was so delicious that the table next to us ordered it too - saying we were their inspiration!   On a side note: the food menu looked pretty delectable, so we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch! Lovely space that is on the smaller/quaint side. I frequent here often as I live right across the street, and is my go-to place to bring out of town visitors. I've tried a few things on their brunch menu but my favourite is their French toast. Light and fluffy, generously portioned, and the caramelized bananas just take it to the next level."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is my go-to romantic spot for sure, me and my boyfriend had our first date here and celebrate many occasions here. The food here is great, the waiters are attentive and care about their customers, they have daily specials which are all made with so much love, the decor is unique and really cool. The restaurant is small, quaint and comfortable, bottom line is, I love it here for both brunch, lunch and dinner! Great little quality spot, unexpectedly great!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for dinner and brunch.  The decor feels cottage chic inspired and is thoughtfully decorated with gorgeous candles, water pitchers and serving pieces.  The patio is filled with cushioned seating along the parameters (and I believe it is heated).  They also take brunch reservations which is a plus.    The dinner menu felt a bit pricey but the portions were sufficiently generous.  We shared the Winter Greens salad which had roasted butternut squash, cherries, spiced cashews in a delicious dressing.  I got the veggie burger and it did not disappoint.  The patty was well spiced and was enjoyable even without the bun.  I haven't dined at Wish for brunch in quite some time but remember liking the challah French Toast and the shakshuka.  Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"The food is truly pretty amazing. (Though limited menu, not a huge variety of healthy fare) And the staff are very sweet and have wonderful energy. But it's... Very... Slow... And feels mismanaged, like no one knows whose serving which table sort of feel. After being seated we waited nearly 20 mins for a server to come see us, my table mate had to flag down the manager and ask for a server, who knows how much longer it would have been if she had not.   Based on other reviews that seems about the typical experience.   That being said, the food everyone ordered was amazing. Like the Nutella french toast and I had the Florentine Benedict, which comes with a parmesan fondue that beats boring old hollandaise everyday. Their cappuccino was nice, and the mimosa my friend had was strong and delicious unlike most brunch places where that is usually the weakest point.   The decor is really so sweet and special, like your best friend's first rental, there is fairy lights, and a drafty but authentically lush and well decorated outdoor patio, a shabby modern industrial aesthetic that makes you feel cozy and cool."}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for a long time. I finally decided to come here on a Saturday for brunch - maybe not the best idea. I stood inside this tiny space, waiting for someone to acknowledge me.. and when they did, they gave the next table to 2 people who came in after me. I told her we were here first, but apparently they came in before and was told to come back in 20 minutes. Fine. We continued to wait and finally sat down at a table with a pitcher of water that was 1/3 full. I was sceptical but thirsty so we drank it anyway. Throughout the whole meal, our server never refilled our water. The table beside us sat down after, but somehow ordered their food AND started eating before we even got to order! (We had the same server). When we got our food, my boyfriend's order was wrong (he asked for sausage and got bacon) and my eggs benedict was lukewarm. The hottest thing was my actual plate and (maybe) the home fries. The food was not anything special, you can get a better quality brunch elsewhere. I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"Food:  Not the reason I gave it 1 star, let's start by that. However, it really was nothing to write home about. Came here for lunch, got the daily pasta which was a tomato seafood spaghetti or sorts. It wasn't bad but I wouldn't order it again. My boyfriend had the brisket melt which we both enjoyed. So overall the food was ok. Probably a 2.5/5.  Service:  The wait for our food was painful. We were sort of on a timeline and when we sat down there were only 3 other tables in the restaurant so we thought it'd be an ok wait for food. Took probably 40 minutes for our food to come, I'm not sure why it took so long? The server brought our food to the table beside us that had sat down after us, and then we realised that it was our food. We had to interject and tell him that it was our food and he just put it on our table and left. Apparently he couldn't be bothered to say a simple sorry?  Also, by the time we were trying to pay the bill, we had been at the restaurant for longer than we wanted to. I get that it was kind of full by then, but they still only had 1 waiter servicing the patio and inside. He saw us waiting for the card machine to pay but would continue walking at a leisurely pace... In the end we just dropped some cash to get out of there. Suffice to say his tip suffered because he made us wait.  Will not be returning. Unfortunate because the patio is quite cute."}
{"text":"One of my favourite brunch spots in the city.  Excellent heated patio (this is the selling point of Wish) - the atmosphere is nice but still laid back. Every brunch item I have tried on the menu has been delicious. Their food is prepared consistently and the service is quite friendly. Most brunch meals are under $15, which is very decent price point for an excellent location, delicious food and an amazing patio!"}
{"text":"Came here twice for brunch. The most recent time, my sister and I ordered the omelette and the salmon burger, both were quite average. To me, the appeal of this restaurant is how pretty the surroundings are. The decorations both inside and on the patio are very nice and the food is arranged with care. I do prefer the quality of the food at Smith Restaurant though, their sister restaurant that's close by.   Servers could also be snooty sometimes. The first time I was here, my boyfriend brought coffee from another shop. One of the servers said that he couldn't bring that here and stood there, waiting for the coffee to be handed to him on the spot. His condescending tone made a lasting impression. Understanding that some restaurants do have this policy, talking to a customer as if scolding them is unnecessary. And having been to other brunch places who will give you an extra mug to put your outside coffee as well as provide quality food and service (Emma's Country Kitchen), the contrast is stark.   Prices are also a little high. The most recent meal where I ordered 2 brunch dishes came up to about $50 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch after dropping off our luggage at the hotel with high hopes and were not disappointed. We got there at the tail end of lunch when it was in full lunch rush. We were on vacation so we decided to have a leisurely lunch and roll with it. The food was worth the wait. I started with a cocktail, The Millionaire Boys Club., which I highly recommend. For lunch I had the Moule Frites, not a large portion by American standards, but surprisingly filling. The broth was sublime so I had to drink it out of the bowl afterward. My husband had the fried chicken sandwich with aioli. He couldn't stop eating which is always a sign of good food. This was one of the best meals I have eaten in a long time. If you don't have time to linger then I would suggest avoiding the lunch hour."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for brunch on Saturday morning. We didn't have a reservation and had to wait 40 mins for a table inside. The place is very aesthetic... especially the small patio. It's very small but  gives a very nice and cozy feel to it. To start, my friend and I ordered a glass of prosecco with muddled raspberries. It was absolutely amazing and had such a fruity, refreshing taste to it. As for the meal, I ordered the poached eggs over smoked salmon with parmesan fondue and a side of home fries. It was also very tasty, however, just a tad on the heavy side. For the price, It was pretty fair considering the the quality and quantity of the food you are receiving. Definitely one of the cutest brunch spots in the city!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and drinks save this rating from being a one or two star. The service was absolutely horrible once we sat down to our table -- we only saw our server to take our order, bring us our meals and give us the bills. Lucky for him we all enjoyed what we were brought, but if we didn't, we wouldn't have been able to get it resolved. I should also mention, there was about 40-45 minutes between dropping off our food and bringing our bills, it was very very frustrating."}
{"text":"Just sat down, just based on service. Our waiter was so passive we almost left. Almost seemed like he ddnt wanna work.   I love good food but I appreciate good service. Not all waiters here are like that but this one really ruined our brunch experience.   Too bad."}
{"text":"Super overpriced. $7 for a small bowl of soup!! People seem pretentious here. There is a patio but no view so what is the point."}
{"text":"Was here with a big group for a birthday brunch. The restaurant is cute but weirdly set up.   Agree with the reviews below that they are weird with reservations. Acted like they tried to squeeze us in when we had reservations for over a week.   Our group of 10 was split into two tables beside each other because they didn't have a big enough table. The table was shaky and when I asked them to fix it they said they would - never did.  Service was painfully slow. From the time we sat down and ordered/got food it took over an hour. Wasn't in a rush so it didn't really matter.   My main issue was with the heat. The restaurant was on fire. We were stripping off layers the whole meal. It was a sauna.   Food was OK - I've had better eggs benny for sure. Good cocktail assortment.  Probably wouldn't be compelled to return unless I was invited to something there."}
{"text":"Every food order for brunch has been tasty. However their brewed coffee tastes burnt and pretty bad overall. I must comment on management and their attitude as extremely unpleasant. Specially with my experience of having made reservations ahead of time and still having to wait way past the hour I had them for. Extra charges for unnecessary changes, in addition to a bad experience in the winter time requesting a seat indoors and not in the tent area where it was freezing. We were still seated in the tent where we felt a draft, freezing. To change our table it took an extra 45 minutes, and zero service during that time (you could ask me if i would like to order a warm drink in the mean time?)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the city - love the ambiance and the food. Portion sizes are great, menu frequently changes and keeps it fresh.  Perfect spot to go for a date"}
{"text":"To start, the food was delicious (see the attached picture)! I had an unbelievable challah French toast and would recommend it to anyone. Incredible vibe in the restaurant and super cute backgrounds for instagram. Unfortunately, I'm giving this review only 2 stars because the service was awful. We all ordered our meals easily. One friend requested chicken to be added to her salad, to which the waiter said was no problem. She also asked if the salad dressing was dairy free as she is lactose intolerant, to which the waiter replied it was. Literally 35 minutes later, by which time we were all getting pretty hungry for our meals, the waiter came back to inform my friend that they actually didn't have chicken. My friend ordered a hard boiled egg for protein instead. The waitress said ok, left and came back 5 minutes later to say they could only do a poached egg and not hard boiled. My friend said ok. Then again, the waiter came back 5 minutes later to say the dressing actually did have dairy and could only offer balsamic vinegar instead. I'll spare you the details, but the waiter had to come back to my friend like 4 times, each about 5 minutes apart, to change something about her order. This delayed all of our meals by like 15 minutes or more I think. Then, once we finally all got our food - which again was delicious - the waiter came back to ask how it was, then rudely looked at my friend's empty Gatorade water bottle on the table (it had been there, empty, the entire time since we got there since we hadn't found a recycling bin yet) and said \"just so you know, outside drinks aren't allowed\" and like snatched it away. The bills were a bit of a mess too and the waiter had to come back twice with them before we could start paying. Wish I could say it was better! Shame"}
{"text":"Really cute + rustic+ feminine interior (and patio) design! The sidewalk patio is available in the warmer months and definitely a better place to sit than inside, which tends to be too dark. The tables are too close together imo, a bit cramped.  The dinner menu is a 1 pager, but I was pretty happy with all the options and the portion sizes. They also have plant-based, healthier/not overly greasy options. I ordered the warm lentil salad ($17, vegan), which was very filling but kind of bitter (not rotten) due to the vegetables used. I probably wouldn't order this again after seeing what my girlfriends ordered. The buttermilk battered fried chicken dish was huge and my other gf ordered the daily pasta, which was very flavorful. Definitely take advantage of their protein options. The food here reminds me of Lola's Kitchen, located in the same neighborhood.  They have drinks here too -- overall a fun and festive vibe for a girls' (or friends') get-together :D"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap and cheerful brunch spot, this cozy restaurant will make your wishes come true! Their eggs bennie are delicious and come with fried potatoes and a side salad for a completely satiating meal. For those watching their waistlines, you can opt to try their delicious spinach and parmesan sauce in lieu of the hollandaise (which is buttery and decadent and oh-so-worth-it).   Their sweeter fare, like the French toast, is equally satisfying and every brunch dish I have ever seen looked amazing. The wait staff is always attentive and coffee refills are frequent! The outdoor patio is great in the summer but the inside of this establishment is uniquely decorated and also worth a visit! Wish is a great place to spend a lazy day on the weekend!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here since my one friend has celebrated her birthday here 2x in a row (this would be her 3rd).   I ordered the turkey burger - good but I won't order this again (maybe I just don't like turkey burgers?).   The Good - overall decor and presentation of food is very instagram-able. popular location, friendly service, fun meal options for decent prices. Also, if you're celebrating your birthday you might get the meal for free (check their website!) - I think this is the only reason I would come back.   The Bad - We made reservations but still had to wait 20 minutes. Apparently this is common for this place! Half the party sat on a bench while the other half sat on flimsy plastic chairs (mine fell over when I stood up, almost right into a random water fountain that was in the middle of the entryway). Also, we were freezing 60% of the time! There was an overhead heater but it wasn't helpful at all."}
{"text":"This place was super cute. I would go back just for the decor. Aside from that, the food was great. We went on a Saturday for lunch and the service was amazing. We recieved our food fairly quickly. Would totally recommend for those looking for a beautiful, cozy spot with delicious food."}
{"text":"Adorable place for brunch! Really liked the decor - rustic wooden floor & tables with comfy white cushioned seats, I was really digging the trendy and cozy vibe.   Came here on a Sunday and so glad they take reservations because the line was out the door before noon.  Started with some lavender tea - very aromatic and perfect for a relaxing Sunday. I ordered the florentine ($15) - egg benedict with spinach, leek and Parmesan fondue. First time trying a vegetarian version and I really liked it! The spinach and leek blended perfectly with the dish and the Parmesan fondue (their version of hollandaise sauce but this was so much better) really brought the whole thing together. It came with homestyle fries and fruit slices on the side. The homestyle fries were pretty amazeballs. Perfectly crispy on the outside and not too oily - it hit all the right buttons.  My friend got the apple walnut oatmeal pancakes ($15) mainly because it said limit of 2 per table which got us curious about it. However I really wasn't a fan. Just tasted like regular old pancakes with walnuts to me.  Overall very great and attentive service and I'll be back especially for the summertime as they have a lovely patio area."}
{"text":"Just a 5 minute walk away from the bloor subway station. Came here for a summerlicious lunch on a Sunday at 1.00pm for 5 people. Their patio is beautiful! We ended up with a seat inside by the large open doors at the back so it was the best of inside and outside space. The place is gorgeous and all white furniture and decor. I sat on the plush white couches filled with pillows only problem was that it didnt feel super clean and the white fluff from the sheets rubbed and left it all over me. The marble tables all had fresh flowers and a pretty water jug.   The shrimp appetizer was simple but tasty. The springs rolls were a bit greasy but lots of peanut flavour and still delicious. Their mussels frittes were a very large portion - nicely good not a lot of closed shells like you end up with at some places and the broth was nice and flavourful. Their fries were skinny and salty. Others who got the brisket sandwich and eggs Benedict said their food was good, by the end of the entree everyone was already stuffed! (even 2 guys who eat a lot) my dessert was a chocolate cake - tasted a bit store bought - but it was still really moist and satisfying.   Our servers was really nice and even chatted with us, the food doesn't come out super fast and we ended up with a 2 hour lunch but it didn't even matter it was a gorgeous Toronto day and such a lovely place to sit and chat. I really look forward to coming back and having brunch with the girls on the patio!"}
{"text":"Most memorable feature: Cozy   Loved my summerlicious experience at Wish.  The couches were very comfy and the restaurant gave a very homie feeling.  Definitely a good date place, very intimate vibe.  It started raining in the patio and a very attentive waiter pulled up the patio cover for us; he also went the extra mile and made sure that the cover was sealed properly so we wouldn't get any occasional drips from the rain.  Excellent service, excellent food, will come back.   Dishes ordered: new zealand lamb chops, steak & frites (blue cheese; chimmichurri), nutella sandwich-challah, traditional apple crumble"}
{"text":"Wish: Summerlicious menu Starter: lamb chops. Medium, done to my liking. Served with orange sweet beets, on a bed of slightly bitter purple lettuce and ...tahini?! That killed it for me, as the chops were tender but not flavorful - and a pesto smear on the plate couldn't provide depth to the dish.  Fusilli with apricots: yummy and creamy, same pesto as my lamb chops with a smattering of oyster and button mushrooms. The mushrooms provided texture, not flavour. I felt the entire dish was slightly disjointed as occasionally id get a sun dried tomato and four times I got a quarter of a sliced apricot. The only item which saved the \"I make this at Marche \" pesto pasta for me was the pine nuts which were generously sprinkled over top.  Dessert: coconut milk rice pudding with rum: take kheer and make it with coconut milk: great combination and delicious. Add rum: bitter unwelcome aftertaste which ruined a good dish.   Would I go back? For the ambience yes- the food, no."}
{"text":"I love this place because their food and service are really good!!!! Especially their steak. One of the best that I ve never have so far. Why not 5 star is because the seats are too closed to others. Although coaches are comfortable but still I don't enjoy listening conversation from other people. Lol."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I came here for my birthday lunch, and it was everything I expected it to be! The decor is out of this world cute and I took countless photos of the interior.   We were there on a Thursday for lunch around 2pm. The restaurant was very quiet, so I was a little confused that we were seated in the very back of the restaurant where there were literally no other people instead of at the front that has the nicest ambience - even though we did have a reservation.  Despite this, the food was AMAZING and surpassed my expectations. I had the grain bowl, which was really filling yet super flavorful and healthy. My mother had the lentil salad, which I also tasted and loved, and my grandmother had the crab cake, which she said was \"on point\" (I'm paraphrasing - she's 90.)  They shared the beach pie for dessert, which they said was absolutely amazing.  I will definitely be going back, and will ask to sit in the front next time!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, great brunch.  I had the Florentine eggs benedict.  Good service too."}
{"text":"My friend heard this place was amazing so we decided to have lunch there. It's a cute little french place with very unique and cozy decor. Upon arrival we were standing for quite sometime and decided to pick a table on the patio. The waiter came out about 6-7 minutes later to move us and literally seat us to the table right next to where we were. He told us that \"usually we seat customers at the front desk\" and p.s. no one was there. He then had my friend throw out her Starbucks drink or finish it outside of the restaurant. She was not impressed.   The food took quite sometime to come out, my friend ordered the beef burger and I had the mushroom grilled cheese. We both really enjoyed our food and it was very filling. The fries were pretty good, but it would have been better it they weren't soggy.  All in all the food and  the service didn't impress me enough to come back."}
{"text":"Honestly....the service here was god awful and the food isn't good enough to make up for it.  On the patio during the winter they turn on the heater overhead which tbh feels like you have been put in a preheated oven and you're just being.....baked. while you eat. So this would normally just be an annoyance except I have really dry eyeballs and the heat was drying out my contacts, which I mentioned to the waiter about 6 times. Instead of moving our table (there were open spaces) or turning down the heat he just shuffled around like he didn't know what to possibly do and then told me he'd tell his manager. But nothing!! changed!! so that was terrible.   Perhaps worse tho is that when I was served my eggs in purgatory (half cheese) the waiter's finger dipped into the tomato sauce thing and I said 'hey your finger just went in' and he goes 'oh did it?' as if he 1) didn't feel his finger going in 2) you can literally see that his thumb is covered in my food. he takes it back and now I'm worried that they're going to make a new one, forgetting my half cheese request, but by the time I try to find the server my new???? eggs in purgatory???? is done and being served??? it's been like LESS than two minutes. I am assured that this one is half cheese and I'm hungry as hell so I eat it.   But my real question is, how did they manage to remake my eggs with my special request in less than 2 minutes???! Did they perhaps just,,....... take it back in and then give me the same finger contaminated eggs in purgatory??????? You be the judge!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a lovely date night at Wish on the first night of Winterlicious.  The staff was super friendly and tentative.  The places was beautiful inside and we had a lovely corner booth.  The spring roll appetizer was delicious (but then again, how could you go wrong with a spring roll).  I had the fish for my main and the banana loaf as dessert.  I was disappointed in the dessert selection, and not because the banana loaf wasn't delicious, but just generally not something I would eat as a dessert.  nevertheless, I would definitely come here again, outside of winterlicious."}
{"text":"Went here for a Summerlicious lunch with my colleagues and I was not impressed.  The atmosphere was nice but we were sat by the front where there's a portable AC unit and the air hose was unfortunately right beside me.  Instead of cool air, I could feel the warmth from the hose.  The service was dismissive at best: no offer of water or drink refill/reorder, no asking-while-your-mouth-is-full about the food.  I ordered the gazpacho for appy and was rather surprised when a white thick cold soup arrived.  As it turns out, the alleged gazpacho was a creamed potato corn soup void of any tomatoes (or cucumber if they were going for the white gazpacho.)  My friends ordered the arugula salad and you can easily count the number of leaves there were on the plate.  And more disappointment on the plate arrived in 40 mins (slow, right?)   My fish and chips was very greasy and the batter was too heavy.  The accompanying mystery mustard-coloured sauce was tasteless.  When I asked for malt vinegar, I was given white vinegar.  (I was starting to wonder if our server was colour blind!)   My friends, on the other hand, enjoyed their sliders because it was your standard trio of salmon, turkey and angus beef burgers.   Finally when dessert came, the chocolate key lime pie was the saving grace for this failed lunch."}
{"text":"A nice quaint restaurant! Went there with my friends and immediately became a fan. Love the white walls and wooden rustic decor! The calamari was lovely, the semolina batter made it very crispy and dry! Their wine selection was not bad, a good variety and a great list of cocktails!"}
{"text":"Nice upbeat atmosphere. The dining room is small so they crank the music a bit, which gets the blood flowing on a Saturday night.  My beef tenderloin was delicious, but the service put a damper on the night. The servers were friendly, but the timing was awful. We had a party of six and the courses were all over the place. The actually forgot an appetizer for one of our guests and challenged us on whether or not we even ordered it (we did).  That being said, I believe in a party of two this place would excel and the service wouldn't be an issue. The wine list is pretty thin as well.  Check it perhaps because the food is decent, but don't bring all your friends at the same time."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating here, however I enjoy their dinner menu much more than the brunch menu. For brunch I have had both:  CHALLAH FRENCH TOAST WITH BLUEBERRIES AND CARAMELIZED BANANAS $15 And BENEDICT-POACHED EGGS OVER PEAMEAL BACON WITH LEEK AND PARMESAN FONDUE $15  Both were good but not mind-blowing.  From the dinner menu I had:  FRIED CALAMARI WITH PROSCIUTTO AIOLI AND CHILI SPIKED HONEY DRIZZLE $19  And  ARUGULA SALAD WITH QUEBEC CHEVRE-CARAMELIZED CARROTS, CITRUS, GARLIC WALNUTS & CARROT, GINGER, RIESLING VINAIGRETTE $17  The Calamari was completely delicious and so is the Arugula Salad. The Calamari is a large portion and is best shared between at least two people- I shared it with two other people and it was more than enough.   The two brunch items I have had were both very good, just a bit too rich for my taste, both times I had brunch I took at least half home for later.   I can't seem to find the weekday lunch menu online -- I had some kind of crispy chicken sandwich, which was alright, but not exactly my cup of tea. But the Icebox Cake was awesome, if a bit overpriced.   The service has been a bit spotty - at times I have asked for a side of mayo and was told that paying $2 extra for an aioli was my only option, which I took and the portion was very small, but at other times I was just given a side of regular mayo and not charged. Also I have found that the servers can be slightly irritable - which I find to be less than charming. I have always made reservations, I have never dined with fewer than three people, usually the online reservations work, however I have experienced arriving and having my reservation not in their book. They did accommodate my group, however, which I really appreciated.   I live quite close to Wish and find it to be a crowd-pleaser for a group brunch. The ambiance is very relaxed and fresh - I specifically love that you can sit in the heated sunroom in the winter!"}
{"text":"quite the cute, contemporary, rustic gem in the south yorkville area... Cozy white booths, walls, mirrored pillars, blue lite bar light, it feels like you're in a heavenly atmosphere.  The chill out Ibiza-esque music compliments the food.  Winterlicious   appetizer: spinach mixed Gorgonzola salad with mushrooms & pate with crostini and onion jam.  For   Entree: Salmon steak with tabule quinoa & Grilled apple wood bacon cheese sandwich  Dessert: mini chocolate cheesecake & homemade coconut tarte is to die for!  The service was very efficient and very helpful, as the waitress had tried the whole winterlicious menu. I think I've found my new hang out place aside from 7 west cafe."}
{"text":"Ambiance excellent.  Server and service great. Food over priced and overcooked.  Unlikely to revisit or recommend."}
{"text":"Food is great.  Went for Summerlicious though and it was sooo slow.   It took 40 minutes for our appetizers. :S.  Too bad because like I said, food is delish"}
{"text":"I wanted to like Wish but this place fell flat. The pillows and couch I sat on in the patio were dirty and had holes in it, and the patio is right next to the street so it's hard not to hear tons of taxi / car noise. The \"fountain\" inside is stained and looks terrible (may only have this in summer) and look up/// the ceiling is full of broken heating elements, what an eyesore. Also our server was rude and when I asked to speak to the manager, shrugged his shoulders because the manager had already left for the day. What manager leaves before closing? Also I noticed chefs bringing in raw ingredients from some random door next to the pay less shoes (i.e. from outside the restaurant on the street) which is less than hygienic.... especially when it's snowing/raining and I see them doing that or people are smoking. Food was mediocre for the exorbitant amount you pay. This place is just for yorkdale hipster snobs to be \"seen\" in. Also what is with those cheap wooden doors during winter? It looks awful.. man how do people say this place is trendy??? It's trying so hard to be but it totally fails if you pay attention. And everything is so cramped inside it's hard not to knock people's stuff over."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch to take out a friend for his birthday and I'm impressed yet again! The food wasn't \"especially\" breathtaking - it was pretty good but the service is what made the lunch and they oversee every part of your meal! Another thing, they make a meeaann sweet Sangria, try it out!  I saw their dinner menu which is a bit more expensive ($40 - $50 / person with a drink) but actually seemed very interesting, maybe I'll try it out sometime soon."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on my first afternoon in Toronto, and it was outstanding. Great poached salmon salad, cheerful and helpful waiter, very nice outdoor terrace.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Although I liked this place it's not gonna be my favourite spot. The best thing they have is probably decor-very unique. From their short (and a little bit overpriced) menu I chose lobster bisque. It was nice and crispy and the sauce was good (but again there are places where they make it much better). The service was fast, and our waitress was super friendly. Four starts because it just didn't impress me."}
{"text":"Went here for a group brunch, because of  summerlicious they had a condensed menu. The meals were delicious, however to substitute to a different fruit on the blueberry french toast, they charged the person 2.00 extra, and they brought her just bananas- even though they said they would bring a mixture of various fruits. Then they said the person who preps fruits was not in yet to cut them up- however we were still paying the extra 2.00. I ordered their house omelette? With spinach and feta cheese, comes with potatoes. To add toast was an additional 2.00. All in all, fair food, ridiculous pricing, amazing venue and relaxed environment."}
{"text":"If your brunch criteria includes \"Insta-worthy\", you've come to the right place. Wish is beautifully adorned with marble tables, distressed wood, natural lighting, cute flowers, and minimal chic vibes. The atmosphere is cozy yet composed, great for a date or a small group.   The food and service were good but nothing spectacular, and a typical brunch will cost $20-25. The portions are hefty - I could barely finish my eggs benny and I was stuffed! I'd recommend making a reservation, but we did get lucky with a walk-in table for two on Saturday at 11:45am."}
{"text":"Good for brunch with friendly waitstaff.  A solid choice for a meal with friends but none of the dishes really stood out as memorable."}
{"text":"Dining experience was sub-par. The food was average, staff were bland, not a busy place so you'll get a seat. My friend had asked for tips on which beverage would be a sweet option the waiter recommended a drink what she received was a bitter drink that she didn't drink at all. We asked to send it back and he said sure but we will have to charge you for it. From that alone we realized it wasn't a high end place and skipped out on appetizers and ordered our mains quickly so we could get out and go somewhere else for drinks."}
{"text":"It's really quite a cute, niche restaurant. They've got white sofas and pillows for you to sit at so it feels very comfy, chiq patio style, even though you're inside. haha!  It seems to get very busy here, especially for brunch, so if you want to come here, I do recommend making some reservations!  They serve up a nice breakfast/ brunch so it's a nice weekend date if you're looking to walk around downtown for the day, or just want to spend some quality time with a few special people.   I've had the french toast here twice now. I really love it! Very generous portions here (pricing is a bit high though so I would hope so..). Comes with caramelized bananas and blue berries and they stack 4 pieces up. I think I should get a prize if I ever finish the french toast in one sitting. Honestly I end up taking two slices to go every singly time! But that just means I get a whole-nother french toast meal sometime in the very near future haha!  My boyfriend likes to get the different eggs bennys here. The most recent one had a cheese fondue on top with some pea meal bacon and a side of home fries. The one egg was cooked a bit too long, there wasn't a runny yolk. But delicious anyway and the yolk was still fairly gooey, so they didn't over cook it by that much.   Servers and hostesses and bussers just seem to all be the same people.. I can't tell who's who! They just all check up on you every so often and really make sure you're enjoying your meal. Slightly feels like a rush because they're so busy and it's a small space, but at the same time, they're friendly, and I think they're really just trying to make sure you enjoy the meal and no one really has to wait too long for anything. The food, by the way, comes out so fast that you think they just read your mind as you walk in.   :) Give it a try if you're looking for a new brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch to celebrate my coworker's birthday with a party of 10. Overall, it was an OK experience. If you are thinking about checking this place out I would recommend going for brunch or dinner ( the cornish hen which is only offered on their dinner menu is my favorite dish here).   Decor: 5 star- I love the ambiance at Wish, such a beautiful place. Service: 4 star- the service was OK. not horrible, not great. Food: 4 star: everyone in our group ordered a sandwich/burger. The lamb burger is good, the salmon burger is very good, the fried chicken club is horrible ( i do not recommend this). We all felt that the burgers were very tough to eat, i think the restaurant should reconsider the way they serve it."}
{"text":"I've been 3 times. Food is alway just ok. But usually the service brings me back. Went last night and the service was poor. Nothing mean or rude, just quietly ignored the tables. The guys spent most of the night behind the bar chatting among themselves. I hope to see better results if I return."}
{"text":"Only the Interior and atmosphere were good.  Food quality was not good at all and price was overpriced compare also one server was serving for the too many tables."}
{"text":"I had a very good experience at Wish. I went for brunch and saw a lot of people there, which is always a good sign. I had the apple oatmeal pancakes; they were delicious and the portion was more than enough. The service was very good, the waiter told us about the specials (an omelette that my friend ordered and was also really good) and he kept refilling out coffee and bringing extra milk. He came 3-4 times to check if we needed anything else. The food is great and it's not so expensive.  The interior of the restaurant is all white and it feels very calm and cozy. I haven't been there for lunch or dinner but I will definitely go back. If you like 7 West then you'll like Wish too because it has that same chill vibe."}
{"text":"You know that feeling you get when you're by a crackling fire, wearing a comfortable oversized sweater, feeling absolutely content with your world at the moment? That's the feeling you get here. There's stacks of pillows everywhere, the decor is rustic yet elegant, and it's so cozy and comforting. The food isn't bad either!  We were a group of 6, and came here for Sunday brunch at 11:30 AM. The place isn't big, but it was certainly packed (if you plan on coming here, call ahead and make reservations). We were seated at a cozy table towards the back of the restaurant, where there was an overflow of couches and pillows - a really laid-back, comfortable vibe. Literally, it felt like I was eating brunch in bed. So relaxing. We ordered: a) the challah french toast with caramelized bananas and blueberries, b) the Charlotte (smoked salmon eggs benny), and c) a tea and a coffee. The food was delicious - large portion sizes, and presented beautifully. Overall, a wonderful Sunday brunch experience.   Special thanks for Andrew for such great service. Despite how crazy busy he was, and the lineup of people waiting for a table, he wasn't pushy, he was super attentive, and he was absolutely fantastic.   For two people, with tax, and tip, our total was around $50.00."}
{"text":"this is a great little local restaurant. the food is modern canadian. everything is very reasonably priced and the service is excellent.  i had the lamb burger and it was awesome. this restaurant has a few different burger options, and i'm sure they're all really good.    the decor is really cool. the whole restaurant is really white and it made the eating experience a little more fun. definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Rude rude rude manger!! Does not know how to respect customer!! I asked a question, he give me an attitude like\" I'm the manager here, I am the boss. Go fuck away\" I'm like ??!!???? My Worst experience for dining in my last five years eating around in Toronto!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor! Adorable! Outdoor patio is awesome during the winter!  Came in on a Friday for brunch, quickly seated. Menu is limited but delicious/worth it!  Serving not your basic avocado toast! Large servings! Two avocados on toast, with two poached eggs, can definitely be shared!  Friendly staff Minutes from Bloor Yonge subway station Not many vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Came here for the Winterlicious dinner a few nights ago after work with some girlfriends - each one of us left extremely impressed with our experience.  First of all, the décor was really lovely and unique. Many of the tables are set up with chairs on one end, and couches with pillows on the other. I read a couple of reviews that said the couches were uncomfortable, and the pillows were dirty, but we didn't experience that at all! In fact the couches were extremely comfortable and the pillows (certainly not dirty) were a cute touch. There is also an indoor heated patio which we look forward to checking out at some point!  Our table had two vases of orange water, which was a nice twist on typical ice or lemon water. It was cold & delicious, and even though we drank through it extremely fast, our server was more than prompt to bring more to the table without us having to ask.  For the app we all had crab cakes, which had a delicious mix of crab salad on the inside, and were nice & crispy on the outside. My only complaint is I wish there was more sauce on the plate for such a large crab cake.  For the entrée I had the butter poached chicken with squash strata, brussel sprouts, and a sage and white pepper cream. Oh. My. Goodness. It was easily one of the best Winterlicious entrees that I had come across (which I was weary about because I had heard a lot of the Winterlicious chicken entrees were not as good as other options). The chicken was perfectly cooked and juicy, the squash strata was the perfect mid point between a strata that would be too light or a strata that would be too heavy & the sage & white pepper cream was simply amazing. Again, my only complaint is that I wish there was more sauce on my plate.  For dessert I had the mini chocolate cheesecake, which was very yummy. Nothing special on the cheesecake front, but still delicious enough that I ate every last crumb :).  The service from our waiter throughout the night was good also - no complaints there.  I would definitely say check it out if you're looking for a restaurant with a different type of atmosphere, and some generally great food! I will be back to check out their brunch menu for sure!"}
{"text":"Solid 3. Decor is very Instagram-able and this place is perfect for an all-girls brunch. The location is a plus for me because other brunch places like Old School, Starving Artist and Saving Grace are out of the way and the wait time in line is muchh longer. While these are all pluses, the food itself was decent (and I would eat again!) but it was not \"impressive, blew me away\" type of food, which is why I gave this a 3."}
{"text":"Went for brunch at WISH with two friends around 12 on a Saturday. It took around 15 minutes for us to get seated, which was not too bad for an 'instagram-worthy' looking brunch. The aesthetics of WISH is super nice and we were lucky we got a seat outdoors on a sunny day. Super cozy and good for a small group of friends or a date.   I got the Florentine, which was an eggs benedict with house made parmesan sauce. It was $16. I would say the food was nothing special. Eggs benny was okay and hashbrowns I would say seemed like they've just been heated up. Not crispy. However, the portions were pretty good. I could not finish the entire meal!   I would say come to this place if you want a cute place for brunch over the weekend, but maybe not for the food itself but for the ambience"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for brunch  at around noon with a bunch of coworkers. I called ahead but resos were full so waited 30 mins for a table which is pretty normal for Toronto brunch standards. Unfortunately, they seemed pretty understaffed and our waiter barely checked on us. Also, we sat in the outdoor extension and noticed the heat had started going and when we asked for it to be turned down because we were getting too warm, the server merely said that its on auto and will turn off eventually. Overall not totally impressed with the service but the smoked salmon eggs benny was pretty good, nothing to rave about though. If you want a cute insta post the decor is cute but ask to be seated at a bench and definitely call and make a reservation if you can!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Awesome Burgers. Look at the pictures.  The last time I ate at WISH was more than 7 years ago and I remember the burgers being sublime, at that time. You know a restaurant is great when you come back 7 years later and the food and service is just as great.  WISH is located just south of Bloor just east of Yonge Street. It is a small place with a few different options for seating (outside in a covered tent, inside near he bar and in a separate room). The staff is friendly and they still roll old school using actual pen and paper to take orders and fill in the guest book.  It seems to be a popular spot for lunch so reservations are recommended. The menu has a great assortment of foods and I can't remember ever having a bad meal here. But the burgers are incredible and amidst the hoards of new burger places I believe I am not far off by saying they serve up the best burgers in all of Canada! You can choose from beef, lamb and salmon burgers. They are huge and the bun is perfect keeping everything together should you wish to tackle it with two hands."}
{"text":"Food & cappuccino were really good. A bit pricey. The ambience was rustic and cozy. The only downside is that we felt rushed. If I pay $35 for brunch I want to feel relaxed and enjoy my meal without being asked if I want my bill. Customer service is significant in a food service business. Next to food quality."}
{"text":"Portions are big. Food was fresh & well prepared. It's a romantic cozy place to hang out."}
{"text":"I wish I may I Wish I might have the Wish I Wish tonight....that opening has absolutely nothing to do with the review....it just came out..sorry..  Anywhoooo..Wish is a very cool spot to go for some good eats and a nice cocktail...it's small..intimate and chic..great little patio and very good looking servers...food is nice..I recommend the angel hair pasta with balsamic reduction and a grey goose martini...ok ..5 grey goose martinis...maybe that's why the pasta seemed so good??...it seems to me like it would be the ideal first date place...although it's been 5 years since I've been on a first date so I could be out of touch with current dating rituals..."}
{"text":"After reading the negative reviews I was skeptical to come but they were one of the brunch places that take reservations.  The decor is super cute and the food was delicious however they seriously need to change their whole attitude and all their customer facing staff.  I read about the terrible guy that serves but I feel all of them of terrible attitude. When we walked in a girl asked our party size and then ignored us and continue to serve her table. Turns out she wasn't the greeter she was a waiter... why ask us then if your going to ignore us. Couple minutes pass while we are standing and then a girl with a resting b!tch face comes and ask our party size. Since more ppl came she asked all at once. The whole time none of the staff smiled it's like they all hate their jobs and their way too cool for the ppl eating there. Also their music was wayyyy too loud.   All in all the stars are only for the decor and my French toast. Other then that.... would not come back. Also their brunch isn't the cheapest. My friend ordered the carrot cake pancake and it was a limit of 2 per table. We were expecting it to taste awesome... it tasted rather terrible..."}
{"text":"The menu is extensive and the food is excellent.  I find the staff a bit overly familiar.  Our waitress did not know how to open a bottle of wine properly.  Most of the staff are really good , but there are a few who really are oblivious. For some reason they always try to dissuade sitting at the bar.  I think the bar and bar area could use a boost. You wont go home hungry."}
{"text":"Severely understaffed Resturant makes for long wait times to order food, receive drinks and get the bill. The resturant carries a limited supply of food as well and most items are sold out on a nightly bases. Overall the experience was terrible, food was just OK and service horrendous. I would avoid this resturant at all costs."}
{"text":"I LOVED the decor of the place. It was a heated patio with nice setup. I ordered eggs florentine which were decently done. The server was a little snobbish. Would try this place for dinner in future."}
{"text":"Food was alright; wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing. Felt like it was a bit expensive for the food  None the less, the restaurant itself was super cute and aesthetically pleasing. Would be a place I'd go for cute pics with the girls!"}
{"text":"Came here as a party of 7 for dinner, we were seated inside the restaurant.. there are two other small tables in that area along with a long couch for anyone waiting. This place is very rustic; cozy...and small! The décor is quite random, plastic chairs, big decoration letter, wooden floors. The patio is incredibly small so I'd probably prefer to be seated inside anyway.  I ordered the salmon burger with fries ($17) and my fiancé ordered the gnocchi ($27). The food here tastes as delicious as it looks.. my only complaint would be that the salmon burger was stacked so high it was impossible to bite. I had to take it apart and eat with a fork and knife! The pricing is hit or miss..but definitely want to come back and try the scallops which were on the daily feature menu for the day.  I did appreciate how they put two pitchers of orange infused water on our table so we didn't have to ask for refills. As others have noted, this place is more suitable for smaller parties as the service is quite slow and separate bills/larger parties tend to confuse the servers.  Can't wait to come back to try the brunch!"}
{"text":"Our seats were extremely awkward. The table has a pillar right at the middle. The pillar had four sides all of which is a mirror. So whenever I try to lean in and talk to my friend I keep on seeing myself in the mirror. It's as if I'm having lunch with two other people, but it's actually just myself and one other person. My knees also didn't have much place and keep on bumping into the pillar. The other indoor seating for parties of two didn't look too comfortable either so there is no point in switching.   The seating experience is so distracting I don't even know what I think about the food."}
{"text":"Heaven. Nestled off Yonge street in an all white boutique restaurant it looks and feels like heaven. From the menu, table setting and water glass to the wall covering, lighting and service everything is immaculate.   In the morning they serve the richest breakfasts and brunch options on the east side. At night the cocktails are suburb and supper delicious.   No recommendations, it's all the best so enjoy."}
{"text":"Came here for the last day of summerlicious. First of all, there's an only place where I was overeaten which is really nice. At least portions worth the time and money spent. However, I've spent 1.5 hours in total in Canoe and 2.5 hours here, it's quite too long.  Let's begin with starters. I ordered arugula salad which was really delicious, every ingredients go perfectly together and it was really healthy food. Caesar salad was average and double smoked lardons made it worse. 8/10 and 4/10 For main food I ordered a healthy bowl chicken. I really enjoy vegetables in the bowl but chicken was really disappointing, I think it was too dry. My friend got black angus burger and a patty was huge but taste just normal, it was goo in total. However grainy dijon made a burger tastes differently and sour. 5/10 and 6/10 For dessert I ordered an Apple crumble with cold cream. It's awesome. It's not easy to describe it, better to try again and again. My friend ordered Nutella sandwich challah and it was just usual toast with Nutella with jam which everyone can make at home. 9/10 and 5/10 I'd give it 3.5 stars bur I can't. So 3 for long waiting. The place is really nice, just need to know what to order."}
{"text":"Below average brunch spot BUT a very cute patio. Recommend for a girls boozy brunch. Emphasize the booze aka you won't care what you're eating.   Eggs in purgatory? More like eggs in hell. Wildly overdone, and sauce is far too thin.   French toast looks nicer than it tastes -- one of the better things on the menu though.   Eggs Benny means overdone eggs and the \"Parmesan leek fondue\" is a poorly done (read: separating) bechamel aka \"I'm too lazy to make hollandaise\""}
{"text":"So things you should know about wish:  1) very small and packed  2) they don't tell you the wait time on the phone if you call ahead 3) they have the sassiest servers  4) their food looks good on the menu, but nothing special when eating   I took one star off for the noise, all the tables are so close together that you can hear the brunch table next to you. I realize it's a restaurant but there are other places with less noise but bigger capacity   I took one star off for the fact my server didn't know much about the menu. We asked if we could have juice he had to go check if they have it.... As well as we got our food later than someone who came after us and finally it took forever to get the bill  Finally the last star is for the food. I got the pancakes and my bf got the burger. Both were average at best.   Overall, i gave 2 stars because as a server in a different restaurant i was pretty appalled by the service."}
{"text":"Love love love the atmosphere and decor of this place! So cute and a lovely place to go with friends! We went for summerilicious and food was good and decent! Love this place more for the atmosphere though! I got the mussels and fries, kale salad appetizer and chocolate cake for dessert. Definitely not anything super special or to die for, but good food nonetheless!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how they survive. People who come here must have really low expectations.  The waiter dropped the salmon burger on my friend and didn't apologize. Then he took the same burger he dropped, put it back together and served it to another table. (unbelievable).   We also found hair in one of the dish, we told the waiter and denied that it was hair when it was clearly hair.  We paid for the entire bill including the dish that had hair. Will never return.  I don't understand."}
{"text":"A rainy Wednesday with the girlfriend. We wanted to try this establishment out (currently planning a bridal shower and looking a beautiful venues). This was one of the tops of the list. Small rustic restaurant, it was beautiful! The heated patio is where we had been seated and even though it was raining it was not that bad at all. Mind you, I did have minor difficultly finding the entrance. Extremely small.  We ordered the B.C prawns in Miami sauce. I must say that was DELICIOUS! (**warning** If you are not good with heat please DO NOT ORDER!) I am no stranger to the heat so this definitely hit the spot for me. Prawns were large in size and the sauce was very flavourful.   I have the Chicken Club and the girlfriend had the Beef burger. Both were kind of just meh.. nothing too exciting about it to be honest. It was definitely aesthetically pleasing to look at but that is were that ended.   I enjoyed the small touches, lemon on the water (wait was it an orange?) in the powder room there were \"wish cards\" that you can right your feedback on. What I didn't enjoy was the lack of personality and kindness in our waiter. He either was not having a good day, or just didn't enjoy what he did. Very to the point one worded answers. I asked how his day was and the response was \"Fine\" We asked where the powder room was, his response \"Shutters\" There is definitely a better way to speak to clients.  Regardless, beautiful venue, mediocre food and uhmm service needs work. Lone behold the bridal shower will not be hosted there."}
{"text":"WISH is my 3rd winterlicious spot. I ordered the clam chowder, the rack of lamb, and the millefoglie.  To begin with the place can be divided into 2 areas: main dining area and the patio. The dining area has this rustic charm to it, add the dim light with candles and it creates this cozy ambience. The patio is the opposite where it is bright (coz of the lights) but the pro to it was the heat.  It was so nice and warm, me and my friend were thinking that next time we should eat outside.   The clam chowder is what I expect it to be: rich taste, mouthful with every spoon, and delicious! Was really happy with it.  For my main I chose the rack of lamb. The lamb was really tasty; however, there was this coulis added on the plate which was sweet and would overpower lamb taste.   The millefoglie was huge! I was already full by dessert and expected something light but me and a friend got a huge portion! Along with it came a cream puff as well lol. My only wonder about the millefoglie was that it felt a little off texture wise: The wafer was really hard. It was a challenge trying to break a piece to eat it with just a fork...maybe a steak knife would help lol (is normally this the normal texture for a millefoglie?). In the end I just started eating the cream and the cream puff lol.   4/5 stars mostly coz of the dessert. Big portion but hard to eat. I would recommend people to dine here."}
{"text":"SUCH a beautiful atmosphere. I love the look and feel of Wish - very cozy and intimate with a romantic feel. I can't emphasize enough how lovely this restaurant looks and feels!  A friend and I visited Wish during Winterlicious. We ordered the Blue Moon Crab Cake for our appetizer. It was very delicious. Warm crab with crispy breading and delicious with a nice aioli and tomatillo salsa to complement it well. This appetizer wasn't heavy or greasy, but it was quite filling, and I found myself pretty satisfied and full before the main course.  My friend and I split our meals so each of us could try a bit of both. She had the Charlotte, which was like an eggs benedict without the hollandaise. \"2 poached eggs on english muffin with smoked salmon, parmesan, leek fondue served with fries\". I found that the smoked salmon was a bit too salty for my liking, though the textures worked well together.   I had the Baked Croissant with roasted brined turkey breast, aged cheddar, kabocha squash spread, apple relish and arugula, served with fries. This was DELICIOUS! The turkey was perfectly moist, unlike many turkey sandwiches that tend to be dry. The squash spread was so lovely, it had a great texture and went well with the cheese and apple relish. Any sandwiches made with croissants are two things: one, terrible for you; and two, 100x better than regular sandwich bread. The crispiness of croissants always win me over. It had the perfect amount of arugula as to not overpower the other flavours of this dish.   Fries - they were nice and crispy, but we BARELY touched them! Our dishes were already so filling, that with the heavier appetizer and our dishes being so savoury, the fries were sadly ignored. We asked to take them to go and ended up forgetting them at the restaurant.. I'm sure they would have been delicious, but with the 3-course Winterlicious meal, it probably would have been more economic to remove the side of fries.  For dessert, we had the Millefoglie and the Blueberry Coffee Cake. After a bite of the coffee cake, I asked the server if I could have it warmed up. It definitely would have gone great with coffee (which our server did offer so I'm the only one to blame), but having it warmed up to begin with would have been a nice touch. It just seemed kind of lazy to serve it sliced and on a plate. Maybe it's just me, but I think that type of dessert should be warmed. The millefoglie was alright. It was quite a large slice, but tough to cut and didn't taste very fresh, kind of chewy? The cream puff was redundant. I'd like to give this dessert another try, maybe at another restaurant or when Wish serves a fresher piece. I feel like it has the potential to be a delicious dessert.. but it just didn't happen during my visit.  Overall, wow this is a long post, I love Wish and can't wait to visit again! :)"}
{"text":"I wish I can give this resto a 5 star because the food was delicious and the decor is super cute but the service just ruined it for me.   We ordered the French toast and eggs Benny, the French toast was to die for. I have been searching for a really good French toast in the city and this one is right up there.   I've read many reviews here about one particular male server that was rude and was hoping we wouldn't get him but we did. When my sister waved him down to tell him we are ready to order, he gave us a disgusted look and said in the most irritated tone \"It will be a minute!\"  We didn't even know how to respond b/c we were quite frankly, shocked.  It would of been a 5 star resto if we didn't feel mistreated by our server."}
{"text":"AMAZING EXPERIENCE! Loved every bit of the winterlicious dinner. Did not feel like they cheapened out on food or treated us differently knowing we were ordering off winterlicious.   Only downside is the restaurant is small and seating was cramped. Server was so attentive and helpful!! The portions were so generous that my appetizer nearly filled me up and I had to pack my whole main course after a few bites.   Would recommend the Mille feuille for dessert, the steak arugula salad, clam chowder for appetizers and the lamb for main. The cocktails are also excellent and they were heavy pours, which is a bonus!"}
{"text":"Nice place with great service ! Our waiter was super nice .   As for the food it was good, not wow but just ok.   Crab cake was a little fishy and not very crispy.   We came here because my fiancée was came here another time and he told me they have the best Caesars in town ! So we get there and yeap, they were pretty fucking good.  Spicy beans ? You don't see that in Mexico ! and it was nice to have in the drink. Next time I'll have something different from the menu, everything else seemed to be good since they told us it gets pretty crowded for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"I met my sister here for lunch to try out Wish's Winterlicious menu. When I called the restaurant to make the reservation I informed them that we would be bringing my 3 month old niece and would require enough room at our table for her stroller. In spite of this being a small establishment, they were awesome at accommodating our needs.    Both my sister and I started with the Cesar salad with lardons (for the layman - that's a fancy word for big ol' bacon bits). I found the dressing to be far too thick, but I appreciated that it was covered in a healthy dose of grated parmesan. Also, the lettuce to bacon ratio was about 60/40 which improved matters greatly! When in doubt? Bacon solves EVERYTHING.  For my main course I had the linguini sauteed with red peppers, grilled zucchini, spinach and black olives in rose sauce. The pasta itself was cooked perfectly, but I found the sauce to be overly heavy (particularly for lunch). I would suggest applying ample amounts of black pepper to balance out the rich sauce. In my opinion, you needn't add parmesan to this. My sister had the fish and chips and said she was pleased with it overall.  For dessert, I had ordered the flourless chocolate cake, but was informed that they had run out of it. Instead, I got the dulce de leche cheesecake which was delicious, but far too sweet and dense to finish. I have a super sweet tooth, but I'd still say you'd be better off splitting a piece of this with someone.  The service here was pretty slow and we often had to remind them to fill our empty water glasses. However, the waitstaff were very friendly. The decor is absolutely charming and it would be a great intimate place to go for a date."}
{"text":"I live on the same street as this place and after passing by it for over a year.. it was finally time! My friend and I had an amazing lunch and I can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu. I ordered the big healthy bowl and it was full of flavour and absolutely delicious. The servers were really nice and attentive as well. We ended up sitting on the heated patio which was a bit tricky as the heat was either way too hot or there was a bit of a draft but it's so pretty.. we didn't mind. Just ask to sit inside if temperature is your thing.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. There was a rotten tomato in my salad.  However, the interior is absolutely lovely and they had a covered patio with a heating bar overhead so that was nice, thus the stars, except the weird green lights at the bar. They had loud house music which was really, really weird because they put on a rustic, cottage interior and it was Sunday brunch. Lovely decor, strange choice of music, and the food was barely average. The turkey breast croissant tasted peculiar. The croissant was overly sweet, almost like a soggy pastry. The turkey breast portions were generous and tasted good. They need to put more of the squash and less of the pineapple for a more balanced flavour. The pineapple overpowered the taste of the dish and did not pair well with the sweet, soggy croissant. I ended up taking apart the sandwich and eating the turkey breast with as much squash as I could scrape off. The crab cake was okay. Something you would find in the frozen foods section at a grocery store. The sauces were what made the dish.  Service was okay, they sat two of us down to wait at the bar and forgot to put our names down and seated a couple of people before I asked and they put our names at the top of the walk-in list. They came around asking if everything was okay a few times.  Nice interior, but would not come back again."}
{"text":"I'm going to rate this restaurant 5 stars. For having the BALLS to tell me that I can't take a picture outside the patio on the couch because that SERVER said \"he doesn't want to set the couch the second time. Nothing was on the couch to \"set up\" except the pillows on there. Literally, I was done my brunch, no customer was outside the patio covered area, and I was just going to sit and take a picture. It was my birthday and I didn't want to make a big fuss about it. You are a SERVER. Don't go telling customers they can't sit somewhereand take a picture because you have to clean up after them. I would even help you fluff the pillow after if you want me to. Don't sass your attitude on me. I'll even account for you having a bad day. Even so, there are plenty of ways to deal with your emotions. Go to the back and STAY THERE. You don't want to deal with customers? GO HOME. I hope you get fired. If you were the manager you don't even deserve the job.   Everyone was nice, food was okay, cute place, but that SHORT MALE SERVER should just go home. People are trying to have a good time, not to see your ugly manners. Grow up and work on your manners. No one wants to see poor communication skills and rude servers.  I hope people see the \"not recommended\" part of Yelp on this restaurant. You can't miss it."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for Wish yet! This place is the most beautiful place for brunch; stunning decor!!! Would be the ideal place for a bridal shower to take place or to take your Mom on Mother's day  ... and it's always good for a great brunch with friends!   You will have to wait awhile to be seated (approx 30 mins the last time I went), but the atmosphere and food are completely worth it!! I loved my french toast with caramelized bananas!  I hope to be back many more times!!! :)"}
{"text":"Such an adorable restaurant!  The atmosphere was great; very comfy and pretty decor. The food was good, but didn't have enough 'wow' factor to it. Would've loved to give this restaurant a higher rating.  The comfy little cafe/restaurant can be easily found (they are located right at the intersection). If you come by car, there is street parking available. Now, the restaurant itself is not big, but they do have a patio. In the winter, they have a heated canopy so you're outside, but kind of inside too. If you sit right under the heaters, it can get a bit warm. The staff was more than happy to turn it down a bit for us. Seating is veryyy comfy, almost like I was having brunch at home. There's a few tables with couches so if you can, try to sit at one.  Their french toast was HUGE. 4 (or 5...) giant pieces of thick, french toast, with caramelized banana and blueberries. Very satisfying brunch. They are also pretty known for their carrot pancakes, which had nice flavours to it, but could've vamped up the presentation a bit.  All in all, a nice play to come and chill with a small group, or with a friend or two. Reservations are needed, and the time slots are usually 2 hrs because they get so busy."}
{"text":"Do you ever Wish for an utterly middle-of-the road, wholly mediocre, completely average brunch? Yeah me neither, but you'll get it here. Basically you're getting what your amateur chef friend could make at home but with a $$ price tag."}
{"text":"On one of the hottest days of the year, my friend and I came to Wish for lunch, only to discover that they did not have air conditioning.  Luckily we didn't have to brave the sun and heat on the patio and were seated indoors, near a window where a fan which provided a little breeze.  We decided to order from the Summerlicious menu.  Appetizers included the spinach pear salad and the soup of the day which was gazpacho (thank god).  Both were good and the gazpacho was definitely refreshing with small chunks of watermelon in it.  Mains - we choose the fish and chips with saffron tartar sauce and beetroot slaw.  The fish was slightly overcooked.  It was a bit hard and crispy the way that food is when it's been left in the deep fryer for too long.  Fries were average, nothing outstanding.  For dessert, we went with the ducle de leche cheesecake which was very good and really the highlight of the meal.  Service was decent, considering the poor waitstaff had to walk back and forth with orders in the sweltering heat."}
{"text":"Wish has all the aesthetics, and the food is delicious. They have a wonderful brunch menu and dinner menu, it's a little pricey but everything I've tried has been delicious!  The staff is pretty average, they do the bare minimum (seat you and serve you) and that's about it. No friendly conversation or anything, just try to get you out and deal with the next crowd. Which is super disappointing. Also parking is so hard to find near there. There's a parking across the road for $15 which is pretty pricey and what I usually end up having to do"}
{"text":"I went to Wish on Saturday,  the place and decor is pretty cozy. The food itself was allright nothing to great to brag about. I had ordered a lamb burger,  it was so big that I couldn't fit in my mouth ( there is a \"that was she said\" joke in there somewhere). So I decided to take bun of and eat the lamb patty with the salad that came along with my order.    My friend ordered Angus burger with fries .she  thought it was good but then again what does she know, She thought Adam sandler's That's my boy was a great movie   If our city got attacked by aliens,  godzilla or decepticons and while defending the city, this place got destroyed. I wouldn't miss it."}
{"text":"I created a Yelp account JUST FOR WISH because of how disappointed I was with it - especially a Summer/Winterlicious-listed restaurant/lounge in the illustrious Yorkville neighbourhood.   Was super excited to visit this restaurant since I moved into the area almost a year ago: Finally went for my and 2 other friends' birthdays. Made the reservation for 9 a week in advance, and asked about the birthday special that's on the website (if the bday person has a bday within 5 days they get a free APP and ENTREE).   Was really excited to try the seared scallop risotto. Got there, nice atmosphere, very quaint and cozy. at first all the waiters seemed nice and cheery and very accommodating (we had one person come by about an hour late). We ordered drinks and a couple of appetizers. I ordered the charcuterie dish and my friends ordered the calamari. Charcuterie dish was great, nice presentation and tasty overall. The calamari tasted like fried chicken.   When we finally were ready to place our orders, I was told they were SOLD OUT of their scallop risotto. Heartbroken, I ordered the striploin steak instead. It was remarkably mediocre. I asked for rare, and it was quite on point in terms of finish, however it was bland, and very unimpressive.   A friend who ordered the lobster bisque had to send it back because it tasted so watered down and rather lemony. When we raised the issue with the waitress she had a nonapologetic attitude and it wasn't until we had to SAY it didn't taste good that she finally got the point and asked what she would like instead. Still didn't apologize for the terrible-tasting bisque.   at the end of the night, the bill was a mess. I wanted to make sure they would honour the birthday special so I asked an older waitress about the special and she questioned me a few times about when i had \"made this deal with the restaurant\" and when I indicated that it was on the website she shrugged her shoulders and said \"i don't work here, I'm just helping out\" with a HUGELY dismissive attitude.   The girl who was originally helping us brought our receipt out - however both my app - the charcuterie and the terrible bisque were on the bill. When I asked about the bisque they removed it straightaway however I was told rather snobbishly that they wouldn't honour my free app because \"i had shared it with other people\" and if I had finished A WHOLE CHARCUTERIE PLATE by myself, then they would have honoured it. we left very very dissatisfied.   The food was mediocre at best (except for the seafood chowder - it was very nice) the service was terrible and overall the attitude was snobbish and condescending. Thanks for making my birthday dinner memorable for how terrible the experience was."}
{"text":"Their food is pretty good and the environment is chill and relaxing. The service is good but it's constantly packed and you would need to make reservation! Definitely give it a try if you haven't!"}
{"text":"Ok why are the portions so damn small????   Came here for dinner I got the mussels and frites. Not bad but small portion of mussels I was so hungry I asked for bread (which was complimentary at least)   Bae got the lamb chops... 3 small little things and doesn't come with a side. Needless to say at the end of the night we ended up at Popeyes since we were so hungry after dinner still.   Okay and the waiter was strange- strange humour not the best service :/"}
{"text":"A cute little restaurant in downtown Toronto. Great ambiance and atmosphere; the patio is a great place to sit on sunny days. The food overall was decent. I had the fried chicken club and the portion was huge. The chicken was crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. The fries were a bit too salty for my liking, but in general it was an enjoyable plate. The only downside would be the slow service. We had to wait approximately 30-40 minutes for food, and probably another 30 minutes to get our bill. It was very difficult to flag down a server and they didn't come around to check up on us."}
{"text":"The service and seating is not the best, but the prices here are good for the amount of food you get. Massive portions."}
{"text":"Yup I am a fan... had a lunch meeting on the patio in August and it was a great little gem of the spot especially considering the area - (Full view of the B Rail Parking Lot).   The dishes are a bit on the expensive side, but the food feels organic, fresh and healthy. I had a hamburger here and it was absolutely amazing. Further, some of the dishes are quite creative so you can experience something less typical from your usual brunch - would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love Wish. Great food, cocktails and atmosphere. Can get very busy. Great brunch. Very small and quaint on the inside."}
{"text":"The restaurant has really trendy interior, and it's very easy to find. We went for brunch on Sunday right after they opened. My friend ordered French toast and I had the daily feature which was lamb chili with poached egg. Both dishes were delicious! We had to pack the rest of it home because it was so good and it was a pretty big portion for girls. However, the reason I'm giving it a three star is that the waitress was not very attentive. She didn't have a single smile throughout our meal (which I think is important for customer service, no?) and said the fewest words possible when serving our table. I would have had a wonderful experience at Wish as I really liked the food and environment, and I hope they can keep up the trendiness with their service as well."}
{"text":"I actually really like this place. The food and ambience is good and it stands out off yonge street as a trendier option. The dinner menu and brunch menu are all great. It gets busy now, however. And it's pretty small. SO make a reservation if you are in a rush. I have found the service to be generally pretty good."}
{"text":"This is a cute little spot for brunch with the girls. Definitely quite girly and aesthetically pleasing, perfect for the insta. It's south of bloor Yonge station if you're taking TTC.  It has a great outdoor patio which I was lucky to enjoy as it was a nice day out when I went. Try to get a spot closer to the building for some shade. The decor is really cute and the name WISH is spelt out on giant faux grass letters. It's kinda in the middle of a sketchy looking area. Brunch I found was average for the price. I had the French toast while my friend had the carrot cake pancakes or something like that. I was going to order drinks but..... the prices were too steep imo.  Cute place if you wanna splurge a little for nice pictures with the girls"}
{"text":"This place needs total renovation.  Smells musty and stinky.  Floors dirty.  Servers sweaty who kept wipiing their faces with their hands then bringing you the food. Not worth the money spent."}
{"text":"A few of us went here for Winterlicious. Surprisingly, the portions were very generous, even compared to regular priced items in other places.  I had the arugula salad with steak for app and it was a fantastic meal to itself. Then I had salmon entrée; I wouldn't say it's the best as it was a tad salty, but it was moist, a good portion and a still tasted a lot better than most places I've dined.  Lastly, I had a slice of millefoglie for dessert - which was the multi-layer custard cake thing (also huge) and it even came with a cute cream puff on the side.  Not to sound repetitive (as I'm out of positive-sounding adjective here) - but it was (also) fantastic.  The server was also really nice, happily answered our questions and came frequently (but not to the point of annoying).  The place small, so it's a tight squeeze- but it's comfortable inside. It had a quite ambient/romatic atmostphere.  There's a patio, which looks sketchy at first in winter as it's enclosed in a tarp/plastic thing.  But as we were  inside, even at -2 deg C temp outside, it was really warm in there, I assume, because of some heat lamps. I didn't eat in the patio - but I'd give it a go even at winter.  Overall, the place was amazing. I passed by it everyday for 7 years and regret that I've been missing out. A great bang for the buck, excellent food, and friendly service. I definitely recommend it and would go again."}
{"text":"I stumbled into this gem while looking for a place to have a quiet lunch and was very pleased I did. The atmosphere is inviting and comfortable, the service was helpful but not intrusive, and my selection from the creative menu was delicious. This all made for a very civilized lunch that would encourage me to return."}
{"text":"This place's atmosphere was super adorable and cozy; awesome place for a date. Service was also great. However, the food just wasn't the best. Actually I ordered the scallops and they were too sweet so I had to ask to change the dish and the home made gnocchi dish with beef, the flavour was just so-so. The calamari was pretty good though! Recommend coming here for drinks at a cozy place but not for dinner."}
{"text":"We went for brunch on a Saturday morning at 10am. They said they had lots of reservations but managed to get us a table. We had the turkey burger and French toast and coffee. Everything was excellent, including service. French toast was very tasty, not overly sweet. They also give real maple syrup on the side. The turkey burger was about 5 inches tall so we just deconstructed it. Decor was very nice."}
{"text":"Super trendy, somehow cozy restaurant.  The  food was decent, definitely passable without being memorable which is fine. Excellent drinks. Liked things fried,so it was great for me."}
{"text":"This place is so cute!!!  We came here for brunch; we had a group of 20. We made the reservation ahead of time and the staff were very accommodating. We got there just before 10am (the restaurant opens at 10) although we didn't have a problem waiting outside for 5-10 minutes, at 10 no one actually came in to tell us they were open... that was kind of strange, after about 5 minutes we walked on and asked if they were open yet- their response \"yes of course\"  Inside, the place is small but so cute! The small details in the decoration is what gives the place it's charm! Everything on the brunch menu sounded delicious! I ended up getting the French toast and was very satisfied although the avocado on toast looked amazing too!  Lastly, out waitress was great, but she was alone serving our table. There was no one to help her accommodate a table of 20 so she has to take orders, bring drinks, and run food all on her own. At the end, she didn't screw up anyone's bill either. My favourite part is that they didn't add on gratuity (which I hate!)"}
{"text":"I went to Wish a while back for brunch and decided to have brunch at the restaurant again this past weekend. I had a pleasant experience the first time I went (this was years ago) and I was surprised by the experience I had this time.  I made reservations ahead of time knowing how busy the place was. My friend and I got there on a Saturday at 12:30pm and was promptly seated on the patio. It was colder on Saturday and I would have liked if we had the option of whether we wanted to sit outside or inside. Regardless, we sat out on the patio and experienced poor customer service. The waiter who attended to our table looked like he did not want to be there at all. It took a solid 15 min before he actually came to our table after we sat down to ask us what we wanted to drink. My friend and I ordered hot water which apparently costs $1 per person. That is just ridiculous for a restaurant to charge hot water.   Food was decent (had the avocado toast on rye and the omelette of the day) but the service was just very poor. I would not come back here due to the poor customer service as it ruined the entire brunch experience."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, feels like you are on a resort! A little pricey but the food was very yummy and in big portions.  We were a slightly larger group (8) and unfortunately, the service was EXTREMELY SLOWWWWWWWWW.... Partially our own fault for not ordering immediately, however even the free bread didn't arrive at or table for about an hour after we got there and half an hour after we ordered. I will come try it again, likely as a party of two though! Don't come here if you are a group or in a hurry...."}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to come in here after work for dinner. They have a gorogous patio but since it was raining out we decided to dine inside. It was really hot inside despite us being advised that the AC was on. The restaurant itself is very small with a very kitschy cottage country feel, with distressed hardwood floors, aged white walls, white chairs and couches, and white marble top tables.  The menu is very short, only one page with a good amount of appetizers, outweighing the mains lists, some burgers, and sides as well as the specials of the day. After taking our drinks orders another waiter came over and asked if it would be ok for us to switch tables as this table was originally reserved for a larger group coming in shortly. We were then seated at a table beside the entrance onto the patio which I didn't mind as it welcomed a cool breeze.  We decided to order an array of apps to share since they looked much more enticing than the mains. After placing our order we were then brought over a basket of warm sliced french bread with a cool creamy garlic hummus dip. I loved the garlicy dip. After a very long wait....maybe 40 minutes or so with no waiter confirming our food was on it's way our meal finally arrived. I assume everything was cooked fresh to order which is why it took so long however everything tasted fresh and delicious.  Blue Crab Cake w/ Tomatillo Salsa & Aioli This has to be the biggest crab cake I've ever seen! Breaded and fried golden brown jam packed with fresh chunks of crab meat. Very flavourful, the best crab cake I've eaten to date.  Trio of Fish Tacos w/ Marinated Cabbage, Guacamole, and Salsa Fresca The tacos were \"do it yourself\" style and came with 3 delicious soft corn tortillas. The fish was crispy and batter seasoned well, I loved the salsa with the addition of pineapple.  Warm Lentil Salad w/ Mushrooms, Root Vegetables, Radicchio, Hazlenuts & Shallots in a Honey Vinaigrette This salad is unlike anything I've ever tasted before! If you are a fan of lentils it's a definite must! Sweet, tangy, crunchy, it covered all the bases! I really enjoyed the toasted hazelnuts and the diced root vegetables in addition to the creamy lentils.  Roasted Brussel Sprouts w/ Grana Padano & Soy Balsamic Glaze Brussel Sprouts are my favourite vegetables so I could help myself from trying them out. They were cooked perfectly roasting them to bring out there natural sweetness plus the addition of the balsamic glaze gave it a pleasant tanginess.  Finally onto Desserts. There is no dessert menu but the waiter advised us of the daily cake selection available. We went with his suggestion and boy did it surpass our expectation.  We also ordered a cup of English Breakfast tea. For some reason the waiter kept bringing us the wrong flavour tea. Finally on his THIRD try he came back with the right tea...  Red Velvet Cake  This is unlike any red velvet cake. A moist double layer cake between to two huge layers of cream cheese icing as thick as the cake layers topped with a raspberry glaze. It was heavenly, leaving no crumb behind.  Overall the food here is a hit all around! Fresh, flavourful, and delicious! However service is quite hit and miss! Definitely a great patio to check out and a delicious app menu plus don't forget to try that red velvet!"}
{"text":"Went to Wish for brunch with a friend last Sunday. We made a reservation so we didn't have to wait (and I'd recommend doing so as when I had gone prior, the wait was 1.5 hours). We sat in the heated \"patio\" but my feet felt cold about 30 mins in.   I ordered the Challah Toast with smashed avocado and poached egg on top. It was served with fruit on the side. The presentation was beautiful. Taste - It was good, but the smashed avocado was a bit sour for my taste. I didn't end up finishing the whole meal as it was pretty heavy.   My friend ordered the French Toast, which I took a bite of.. tasted absolutely amazing. Would definitely recommend ordering that.  My half of the bill came to 26$ with my order of tea, which was a bit on the pricier side, but for the decor and the atmosphere, it was well worth it."}
