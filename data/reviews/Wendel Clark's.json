{"text":"Service sucks and the night menu whatever they serve the portions are the size of cafeteria items you order in high school, its a cash grab. I asked for loaded nachos with chicken that costs around $16.99, there were barely any nachos and no chicken at all, I sent it back they literally chopped up some chicken and tossed it on, didn't redress the whole thing, I was really disappointed. The beer is extremely flat and the waitresses don't give two shits about their service."}
{"text":"Nice looking restaurant at a great location.  Went with my family. We were a group of 7 people for 7pm on a Friday night, which we reserved ahead of time.  Server was polite and prompt. Was going well until the flies buzzing around our table started to cause a nuisance.  Ordered our drinks and food shortly after.  Right before our food came out, waitress approached my wife saying they had run out of rice and asked if she wanted pasta noodles instead or if she wanted to change her order. She opted to replace the rice with noodles. Strange how you could run out of rice... Not exactly a perishable item so I don't see why you wouldn't want to keep well stocked. Anyways, food came out, everything looked good. My wife's dish, the stir fry, was missing some of the ingredients that was listed in the menu. No Bok Choy or snow peas in it, which was mostly the reason she ordered it. It tasted good otherwise, so we didn't complain. We honestly don't like to complain, but maybe we should have.  Now onto my Wendel Clark burger I had. Looked great, but the patty was burnt. Again, did not complain because I was pretty hungry and didn't want to wait longer.    The rest of my family had the tipalia or meatloaf, which they said was fine.  I guess if you're looking for a good sports bar to just hang out for drinks and simple appetizers this place is good. But for actually dining in for a meal as the main event, I would not recommend. Reading from other reviews, this isn't the first time they ran out of food items. And if you can't cook a basic burger properly, you have no business working in a restaurant, nevermind  slapping Wendel Clark's name on it to add insult.   In short, nice environment for drinks, apps and watching games, not great if you're expecting anything more than that."}
{"text":"I went here for apps with my sisters. It wasn't the greatest. The poutine had shredded cheese instead of cheese curds. When I asked the waiter about the cheese, she said they are intended to be cheese curds (I'm not sure what that means, but okay.) We also ordered the Wendel sliders, and the tiny burgers on them were burnt and tasted like frozen burgers. The wings we ordered were okay. The nachos we ordered had that processed nacho cheese on it. The service was mediocre. Overall, the food wasn't great. I wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"Figured we come here for leafs games since it's named Wendel Clark's, but the experience just isn't living up to expectations.    The bartender is nice (forget her name), and the manager is welcoming and actually chats w us.    Food is good but nothing to write home about.    The 2nd time here our group sat at a table instead of the bar.  The waitress serving us was not personable.  I don't think any of us saw her smile.  It wasn't only our table who was frowned on either.    The place was cold the 2nd time we visited.  They claim the heat was on the fritz.    One guy complained his beer was warm and his pop was flat.   They don't have HD on their tv's.    Hopefully the next time we end up here it's a better experience, if we end up here again...there's a pub a couple doors down..  I'll give 3 stars for now as the aforementioned bartender was good (who also remembered us the 2nd time we came), and the manager was welcoming both times (who also remembered us).."}
{"text":"Food is ok. We ordered calamari for starter and they were small pieces and sweet potato fries. Both looked like they were cooked in old vegetable oil. After dinner, we ordered brownies with ice cream for dessert and the ice cream was so soft and pretty much melted. It was ok if brownies were hot and warm but they weren't."}
{"text":"Ordered the Thai Chicken Salad with cashews & mango to go. Got it home and discovered no chicken, no mango  called them back to say \"hey, no chicken, no mango\" they said give us 1/2 an hour cause we have a large party here. WHAT? You screw up the order and we have to wait 1/2 hour for a chicken breast? If you can't handle the public AND  a large party then pick one! No one said anything about a large party when we placed our order. Never did see any mango"}
{"text":"Well tried this place for the first time on a Saturday because it was nearby, came around 6ish and didn't get a table until almost 8 even though there was quite a few tables that were empty. Other patrons waiting were saying the same thing until they eventually sat us at those tables that had been idling there the entire time. Staff was unapologetic and once we sat down we waited quite some time for our server as well.   We were told that we can not order food because 'the kitchen is backed up', and we could only order drinks.   We did look at the menu while we waited in the front lobby and it seemed pretty basic yet pricey for what they're actually serving.   After some time waiting it became quite clear that there is an inherent favoritism for their regulars, which most places do but the table beside us was able to make a reservation on a Saturday evening, got their drinks way before us even though we were here first, and also got menus to order food from the supposedly 'closed kitchen'.   I did look at other reviews hoping to see that this was just an anomaly but unfortunately it doesn't look like this was the first time someone has had a bad experience here and these are reoccurring problems.   So my group, and 3 other parties that walked in the same time we did, left without food and barely any service. The entire time the server only came to our table twice.   There are a lot of other restaurants and bars nearby and you're guaranteed to have a much better time anywhere but here, even dave and busters. Would have at least been nice to see some concern from the manager or staff."}
{"text":"Literally the best baby backed ribs I've had yet, totally worth the trip from Toronto. The atmosphere and staff were very welcoming and attentive, and made for a fantastic night out for dinner with the family. I'll certainly be returning again soon."}
{"text":"Went last night with a group of around 8 of us. First impression, not bad... The layout and atmosphere was nice. Bar was lit up and lots of seating ! A lot of people looked under age and no security IDing, considering its 2.99 bar rail all night... But hey, that's not my problem.   MY problem was the service. Edwina was attentive at first, and by first, I mean like the first 30 mins. After that, it was like trying to find Waldo. The drinks each took 15 mins to come, and the bill took an additional 30. I came at 10:00, left close to 2... I only ordered 4 drinks, prettty much back to back.. Asked for the bill at 1, received at 1:28... If that gives you any indication of the timeline. If she was the only waitress on the floor, then fine, no problem. But she wasn't. Far from it.   At the end of the night, everyone in the group left visibly upset, many of us have actually been there before, and have said that this service has never happened before..  So here's to hoping that my next time there will be different.   If there will be a next time.."}
{"text":"Garbage...save your $..went there for my daughters 20th birthday . Ordered 2 appetizer..1 goat loaf there was more balsamic vinegar I've seen before...and the calamari for $ 12.99 had 11 pieces on the plate..I swear the kitchen staff ate half of it. My girls had the chicken tenders..so far no problem....my wife had the roast beef dip plate..she's had the shits ever since..I ordered the top sirloin -Medium...My shoe soul is more edible..sent it back..THEY we're kind enough to offer me another steak free of charge...no thank you WAS my response...ever seen South Park episode boogers and cum..no way I was going to get another steak...so pissed off I left and was 1/3 way home when I got picked up by my wife and daughters....to top it off...she told me the bill was 106.00$ WTF FOR CRAP..NEVER AGAIN...I'd rather go hungry for a night. Wendel you need to check out your restaurant more often..and your going to franchise..dont..save your hard earned $...you deserve it being 1 of my favorite ML. There asking for a star rating..if there was zero I would pick that but since there isn't..I'll go with 1...but it's a lie...stay away service is slow and the food is crap and over priced"}
{"text":"This past saturday, I went here for a friends birthday party. Decor and atmosphere could use some work but is typical of a sports bar. The whole evening could be best described as mediocre. Service was a bit slow and a bit unfriendly, but i reasoned that it was a party of fifteen and perhaps she was busy or overwhelmed.  All of this could have easily have been forgotten if they hand't applied a 17% auto gratuity without telling the majority of the party. Being a long time server/bartender myself, I tipped 18%, despite my assessment of the service, assuming someone in the party would be harsher and not wanting anyone to have a poor night (the server.)  When I realized that I had unwittingly tipped 32%, I spoke with the server. She told me that they usually explained the tipping policy on the phone when the reservation is being made. I argued that it is not the persons, who brought 15 people into your establishment, responsibility to explain your restaurants policy, it's yours. She said shed speak with her supervisor. Nothing was done about it.   In my decade of experience in the service industry, I have never added a tip without first acknowledging it to the customer. This practice has the potential to leave patrons feeling robbed."}
{"text":"Travel quite a bit.  Have had dinner er here several times over the last 6 months.  Thought that the first couple times may have just been an exception.  This time was no different and had to leave my first poor reciew....  ordered the Cobb Salad and the lettuce was definitely old and soggy.  Could taste the metallic taste in the vegetables in the salad.  Cost was $15,99 and a major dissipointment.  Will not be eating get here again and do not recommend to others..."}
{"text":"Looks like wendal clark has fallen on hard times.  Ordered a beer.  Sorry were out.  Ordered a coke and orange soda.  Sorry were out.  Finally got a beer that was disgusting.   Service was terrible.   By far the worst restaurant I have ever been to."}
{"text":"Price Range (per person): $11-$25 Visit Again?: No Party Size: 2   Hostess was very nice. Server was great. Nacho presentation was very nice. Taste was horrible. Please Wendel, get rid of that pasty cheese like mixture you're using. That stuff is truly awful. The only thing I can think of is that you've never tasted good nachos or that you've not tasted these ones. There are many restaurants/bars in the Toronto area that have good nachos. Two examples are Southside Bistro in Markham and The Foggy Dew in Toronto. There were also about 3 times the number of hot peppers on these nachos as compared to other places; way too many and I like hot peppers. And the chili we added on as a 1.99 extra. At first we wondered if it had been left off the order and asked our server if this was the case. It was not. Pulease..... 20 kidney beans and about the same number of 1/4\" diameter balls of hamburger do not a chili make. Ok, so we didn't eat about 1/2 of the platter and complained. The server said she would get the manager. He came over and talked to us about our experience and offered us $10 in Wendel bucks. Nice but since we're not going back I gave them to someone at the bar. Too bad, so sad. And it is sad, because you've got a good setup there and I would like to think it's not just a business for you based on your name appeal but that you're providing something of value to your customers as well. For this dish, I would say the value I got was $2 for presentation, $10 for tortilla chips, tomato, peppers and lettuce, 3 cents for the chili, and minus $12 for the cheesy guk. So please, Wendel, for the love of all that's holy, change the way you're making those nachos."}
{"text":"First time at this place as I participated in the CMYE event hosted by Kris for the Yelp GTA event, and I was pretty impressed. Usually bar and grills give me the impression that it is extremely loud, rowdy, and even a bit unclean, but this place was quite the opposite. It looked pretty classy and although the TV and music was on, it wasn't too loud that it would distract me from talking with others.  Service was very attentive, they were really quick in getting drinks and refills as well as giving us new clean plates halfway through. I liked their appetizers, none were too greasy, and was a fan of their sweet potato fries as well as their dips. Would definitely consider going back to this bar if I was in the area.  Side note: They had pretty good music choices."}
{"text":"I wanted to send a big thank you to this venue for hosting the first CMYE for the Yelp GTA group. Franchesca and her staff were super professional, helpful and attentive to our group of 15's needs.   Not one of us ever went longer than a minute with an empty glass. I would definitely recommend coming here with a group like we did for their amazing Thursday night drink specials ($3.50 bottles) and some apps to share amongst friends.   The group of us shared in platters of Sweet potato fries, Hat trick dip's and chicken wings. The party seemed to really love the naan bread that came with the dips over the chips as they disappeared quickly. The chipotle mayo that came with the perfectly cooked sweet potato fries was very tasty with just the right amount of \"zip\" - just like Wendel's wrist shot. The wings were a nice flavor cooked very well - I know wings are simple BUT you would be surprised how easy it is to mess them up. Points to WC's.   I have to give an extra thank you to the hostess who went above and beyond the call of duty with helping me to set up some balloons and other items in anticipation of my guests. Also a big THANK YOU to the manager Frachesca for opening up the drink specials earlier for our group - it was greatly appreciated.  I have been here previously for dinner as well (which is what made me choose this as our meeting place) and the food is always top shelf. I will be back especially once hockey season starts :)  Thanks again Wendel Clark's for a great night :)"}
{"text":"I went here with my parents this past Sunday (the day before Family Day) at about 4:45pm. The place was nice but the staff were very disorganised. The host or manager (I'm not sure) wasn't sure if he wanted to seat the 3 of us because despite the fact that there were plenty available seats, he mentioned that he had a lot of reservations coming in 2 hours later...  After he decided to seat us, it took almost 10 minutes for our server to greet us, probably because the accidentally assigned her to the wrong table (next to us) or perhaps she was confused.  Our server's name was Sarah and she was quite nice though a full time student and possibly a bit inexperienced.  In any case, everyone was very polite, if not super friendly and they were all professional. While a bit pricey, the food was excellent and the portions were large if a bit odd - I ordered rib and wing combo for example and only got 3 wings and about 10 ribs.  The staff was also a bit slow, as we were waiting for drinks, the table wasn't cleared of appetiser plates and so on.  They were also a bit unprepared - having only warm wine of a particular kind (house white) which is pretty basic.  They didn't have a desert menu either, though the staff had it committed to memory (though I didn't test them on it)  For a newly opened place, I expected a bit more, but I will definitely give the place another try since the food was so outstanding!"}
{"text":"Came here for a party of about 25 people and although the birthday girl booked a VIP/booth seating area weeks ago, it was given away last minute and we ended up being seated within the open area.  Upon arriving, it took a really long time (30 mins) to finally get our drinks. Between getting the drinks and our food, I basically emptied my pint by that time.. And I was sipping conservatively... At that point I was filled with liquid and didn't actually feel too hungry anymore  I ordered the chicken parm - took about another 30 minutes to arrive. Along with that, not everyone's entrees arrived at the same time so some of us were waiting and some of the food got cold.  The chicken parm - I should post a picture but I have to say the chicken to pasta ratio was rather off. The chicken parm was probably the size of butterflied whole chicken breast with about a fistful of pasta. Normally I wouldn't have complained if the chicken parm wasn't dry, but it was topped with a tad too little tomato sauce. No complaints with pasta, in fact they even shredded it so I could eat it easier and not make a mess with the tomato sauce.  The decor and furnishing just felt like what all stars or puck&wings, St. Louis would have been 4-5 years ago. Old furnishing and even the VIP room looked like a cafeteria.  Service was slow and most of the servers seemed very uncoordinated.   Best part about coming here for the party was the cake, and we brought that, unfortunately"}
{"text":"Dined upstairs on an early Friday eve before a Rose Theatre event.  Service was OK, food average or lower.  I had the short rib pappardelle which tasted like beef stew on wide noodles.  My wife had the beef dip, her stomach didn't enjoy it.  Nice location and our downtown Brampton really needs something like this, I hope they up their food game."}
{"text":"Walk on by! There's a ton of cute a tasty places in the downtown core, or brampton in general, DON'T GO HERE. My husband, best friend and I went on a Sunday afternoon, happy to see $5 Cesar's. we were seated in the front of the restaurant by the windows, the sun was beaming in, and I had to try hide behind a pillar to get some shade. It took a good 20 mins to get our alcoholic drinks, due to the sun we all also asked for water as we didn't want to get too dehydrated with how hot we were. It took another 10 mins to get the water.  30 mins after the water, For apps we ordered the tempura green beans with ponzu sauce, and sliders. The beans were by far the best thing we received at all. The sliders had tiny patties that were black and dry as all hell. By this point we were starving though and my hubby and my friend shared those. I couldn't stomach them.  For dinner I ordered the tilapia & shrimp in garlic butter with veggies and mash, my hubby ordered the buffalo chicken burger, fries & gravy, and my friend got a bacon cheese burger, fries and gravy. This took at least 30-40 mins to come, by that point we were all over hot, and starving.  Right away I could see how over cooked and dry my fish and shrimp were, they were also a curry yellow colour... not the \"garlic butter\" I was expecting.  The tilapia smelled fishy and inedible so right away I sent it back. My hubby took a bite of his \"buffalo chicken\" burger and it was dry and over cooked with a sickly sweet sauce, not \"buffalo\" spicy sauce he was expecting, his gravy was also forgotten. My friend had asked if the beef patty was real ground beef, or frozen. The waitress has said \"it's good! It's fresh\" so he ordered it. It was not fresh whatsoever. It was grey and black and dry as all hell. He did receive his gravy at least and being as hungry as he was, he doused it in the gravy to be able to swallow it. Both fries were still raw in the center as well. The manager came over and said he'd take the two meals off the bill (ugh duh we didn't eat them!) so the waitress offered two Cesar salads, because they'd come out faster. 10 mins after that... the salad comes. 100% all stem pieces, and the obviously bottled dressing was bland as all hell and over dressed. Just tasted like stems thickly dipped in mayo. So those also got sent back.   We are starving as we left, and extremely unhappy. My husband also ended up in the toilet the entire night, I'm happy he only had a bite or two of that chicken.   I will not be going back... and if for some reason I get dragged in kicking and screaming it will only be for bottled beer, and the tempura green beans.  Just stay away, hopefully it will be replaced soon with a better restaurant considering the downtown core has a high turnover rate."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I really did. It's two blocks from my apartment. It's a celebrity endorsement. OK mostly it is two blocks from my apartment.   Me and two friends hit the patio the other night and we told the server, who seemed reluctant to serve us, that we were just getting coffee and dessert. She kept trying to make awkward jokes that barely masked her resentment. Why did she resent serving us? Who can say? But it showed.   It took way too long to get our drinks. The cream packet I put in my coffee turned out to be bad, making lumps in my coffee. That can happen anywhere so I wasn't too stressed until the fact I wanted new coffee seemed to annoy my server. Sorry I didn't want to drink spoilt cream in my coffee??   Then when we wanted to order dessert it took her forever to come back. Eventually when we got our desserts (which was a super long wait again,) the cremes brulee were soft on top (supposed to be torched to a crispy sugar coating!) and not even that firm in the middle either. My apple blossom was nice, but it had been waiting around so long in the back the ice cream was half melted down. I was going to share the ice cream with one of my table mates and that didn't work out so well.   So, a few more resentment-masking comments from our server later and we got our bills and paid up.   The only thing we liked about this restaurant was the patio. It's in an absolutely perfect location in Garden Square. So go for the patio, and assume that's the best you're going to get out of Wendel Clark's.  Would I go again? Possibly. But the second experience had better be WAY better or I would definitely not go a third time."}
{"text":"Wendel Clark would likely not be too happy to have his name associated with this location.   I was excited when this place opened opened due to the lack of choices in the downtown Brampton core but they failed to impress.  Stopped in with a friend for drinks and a bite to eat. We were seated quickly and greeted by an overly unenthusiastic server. He clearly hated his job and should reconsider doing something that does not have him dealing with the public.   Poor beer selection and I'm pretty sure they forgot to put vodka in my friends vodka soda.   We ordered salads which were ok but super overpriced for what they were. Just an overall disappointment.   I would not recommend this place, nor will I be returning in the future."}
{"text":"If you want a prime example of how not to run your restaurant, take lessons from Wendell Clark's.  There was an event being hosted here on a Saturday night and the top floor had all tables reserved. Knowing that they were expecting a full house, they were unprepared and understaffed.   Host/hostess turned a couple of my friends away from coming upstairs as they were \"at capacity\". After speaking with the hostess it was the staff could not handle any more people upstairs.   There were tables available but obviously management does not understand how to staff and organize when there is a full house.   Such a shame and pitiful display of how not to staff and coordinate.   After every order, the waiter brought the bills as there were a lot of people and didn't want confusion, which I can kind of understand.   There was more confusion towards the end of the night as they said earlier someone paid for my burger yet then said \"oh, no the original wait could not find that bill\".  NEVER come here on a busy night, actually don't even bother coming here unless they make some big changes, go somewhere else.  The only saving grace for this restaurant was the group of singers and performers that were upstairs.  I hope management and the owner can learn how to staff appropriately when expecting a lot of people on a saturday night.   Wendell Clarks, when you read and I hope you do. Understand that you lost a lot of money yesterday from food and drink orders because you were understaffed and that is 100% on management not the wait staff."}
{"text":"A review based on limited experience since I only had wings and poutine which are pretty basic items to prepare. 2.5 stars but rounded up for a decent atmosphere.  The inside is fairly nice and they may possibly be the only true sports bar in the entire city as there are indeed big screen tv's everywhere, with a view to a screen anywhere you sit. The menu and beer selection are very reflective of being a sports bar with a very standard bar menu and entirely macro brews available.  Not much to report on the wings, but you can chose between regular and breaded. Fairly meaty size. Note that the 'hot' are only medium and when I tried the 'suicide' it was nothing more than hot.  They actually had fresh-cut fries for the poutine which was a nice surprise as I expected them to use made from frozen. The cheese curds were bonafide squeaky too, but the gravy was a bit too thin and not hot enough. The bowl was also too wide, which didn't allow everything to stack together. As a result, the cheese was only partially melted.  Nothing spectacular, but it was at least quite busy late at night which is a rarity in Brampton. I have to give them credit for that and adding some life to downtown. I would suggest measured expectations, but certainly a place worth going to when wanting to catch a game."}
{"text":"Food was good,  I was very impressed with the decor - clean, modern.  not kid friendly and our waitress was completely clueless."}
{"text":"We live in the area and are always excited and willing to support new businesses. Wendells is your average sports bar with lots of tv's , average service and non descript average food. We've been there  a few times and their fish and chips does stand out. The downside was the music was cranked way too loud for a late supper at 8pm."}
{"text":"This is another good place for consultant's and travelers to get a good meal at a good price. Unfortunately the price of liquor is almost prohibitive anywhere in Canada. So stick to draft beer. Food was good, I enjoyed a grilled chicken with panchetta on a chimbatta role. Steak fries and a white Russian. I don't blame bars for the cost of booze I blame the greed of the government. Overall this is a decent place to have a beer and spend time with colleagues and friends. 3 of us ate for around 50 dollars (Can) but two drinks I added 30 dollars. Just ridiculous, stick to having a beer."}
{"text":"We come here about once a month after a meeting.  We usually have about 20-25 people.  We used to go to another restaurant nearby, but they kept closing the kitchen early on us.  We have not had that problem here.  The servers are always friendly and they keep the drinks flowing and the food coming.  It can be pretty slow on a random Tuesday night at 10pm and sometimes, although I can never understand it, servers are upset to see large groups come in - but not here!  In fact, the last two times, the manager has come over and sincerely thanked us for coming in.  Wendel Clark's is set up like a typical sports bar with plenty of tvs and open seating all around.  The programming on the tvs tend to be a little hockey-centric fir my taste, but - hey - we are in. Canada after all.  The menu is typical bar food and the quality is average, but it does help the beer go down smoother.  You won't be disappointed in a visit to Wendel Clark's."}
{"text":"0 stars! Popped in for dinner with the fam and even though there were many visible empty tables were told it would be 15 mins to be seated...maybe sooner as they just had to clear some, but it still took 15 mins.  We took a seat at the bar to wait and ordered drinks.  The bartender was quick and friendly. When we did get seated, we were seated at the very back of the restaurant by the sliding doors and there was a draft.  We placed our order, got our drinks and an app and then were ignored.  Finally, fed up with waiting (45 mins after getting our app, no food, and no follow-up) we asked another waitress for our waitress and then her for our bill to leave.  The server dilly dallied around, served another table and then went to take an order from yet another table.  We spotted a manager and again asked for the bill as we wanted to leave and explained that we had already been waiting and he too dilly dallied around without bringing our bill.  It took us getting up and walking to the door to finally get their attention and the bill at which time they tried to chastise us for leaving.  Brutal!  I will not return."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place.  It has a lot going for it - big screen TV, I can watch the hockey & baseball games at the same time, good beer selection, nice atmosphere, good service, etc.  I have been here many times as business brings me to Hamilton regularly.  All that said, I was very disappointed with my food tonight. Past visits I had the Meatloaf, which was awesome.  They have removed the meatloaf from the menu.  In fact, the menu selection is very limited now.   The ribs seem to be the highlight on the menu, so I ordered the wing and rib combo.  The wings were good (nothing earth shattering) but the ribs were disappointing.  First of all, they were the cheaper side ribs instead of the better quality back ribs.  Instead of slow cooking and smoked - like ribs a suppose to be done - they were obviously boiled with bbq sauce poured on top.   I hope that the restaurant changes their food and takes this review for a positive direction forward."}
{"text":"Typical sports pub decor and vibe walking in only with Wendel himself walking around talking to the guests. He came by our table and said hello (extra star). I got star studded from him and his glory days wearing the C for the leafs.   The service overall was great, friendly staff and even though they made a mistake on a side dish they made rushed out the order at no additional cost.   I ordered the Buffalo chicken sandwich (one of my favorites) and it was good. The baguette maybe too much bread. Two chicken fillets drenched with franks red hot sauce. I really enjoyed it. The person I was with ordered the meat loaf. I had a bite, it was great but a little too salty for me.   I would probably go back, the prices were typical Boston Pizza prices."}
{"text":"I ate at Wendel Clark's during a Leafs game about a week ago. The place is pretty much the perfect place to go if you are hanging out with some friends and watching a game. They have hockey memorabilia all around, the food is easy to eat while watching the game.  Pros: Great Atmosphere, lot's of tvs to watch the game on. The prices were pretty reasonable. The staff was pretty good.  Cons - The waiter I had was always in our face like every two minutes. I understand he wants to be attentive, but he was a little bit too much so.  Overall The nachos took a while to get there because of some accident in the kitchen, but they made up for it with a free round, and admitted it, which was admirable, so it wasn't so much a both. I was surprised by the Sandwich I got, it was quite good, not at all what I was expecting, but I enjoyed it.  All in all, if you are in the area, and are looking for somewhere to watch the game with friends, I would definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Monday night, as expected, was quite empty.  An average sports bar.  Service was average.  Had the dry cajun chicken wings - chicken was stringy and hard.  Buddy indicated his burger were quite dry.  Suggest to come only for beer and drinks."}
{"text":"poutain was tasty, but the crunchy haddock is excellent. it was a huge piece of fish and the salt and vin chips breading was excellent. highly recommend it. others at my table had the talapia dish, which looked boring as did the salmon dish. The burgers were also excellent.  However, I have still not had a decent beer in Canada. someone needs to import a nice hoppy IPA from the pac nw of the US, or a nice English bitter."}
{"text":"The customer service when we first came in was disgusting. Hostess  Was very snotty when we came in, seriously acted like she Was doing us a favour by seating us. Server was nice, food was  Cold, steak was cold, 1 peice of broccoli and a few peppers for veggie, I felt like I was eating at a lower end jack astors without the great service."}
{"text":"I ordered a simple poutine and I was very disappointed. The gravy and the fries were very cold, what was most likely warmed up in a microwave. My friend ordered chicken wings that weren't cooked properly. The cutleries were dirty. And the staff kept messing up our order, they kept bringing us food that no one on our table ordered. Only reason we chose the location was because they had the capacity to seat our big group. Unless the way the place is run changes I won't be back. On the upside, it's a nicely layed out bar."}
{"text":"On a Friday evening,  torn between trying out the Ivy and growling stomach.  You guessed it,  the hunger won.  We decided to try Wendell Clark's on a rainy cold night.  We both tried the fish N chips.  I'm glad I opted for dinner than drinks and Loud music.  Ambiance wasn't the greatest,  there were groups of men watching the game,  but that was to be expected if a sports bar.  Service wasn't outstanding either,  as the waitress forgot to give us malt vinegar and ketchup.  But the food was good.  I didn't have high expectations but I was mistaken.  Serving was huge and the fish was crispy and delicious. I wouldn't mind coming back for fish N chips and a cold draught."}
{"text":"Came on May 4 2013 for the Yuk Yuk's comedy club. Did not try the food, so cannot say anything about it.  THE WOMEN'S WASHROOM IS IN HORRIBLE CONDITION!!! Where is the management??? The ceiling and the bottom of the wall are gone and looks like you are in a dungeon. I wanted to take pictures just so they speak louder then words, but after opening the feminine product disposal unit, I ran out of the washroom like in a horror scene. It looked like it hasn't been cleaned in months and is filled with what I cannot even called water, since it looks like a butcher's garbage bin. And the smell could kill even a fly. WHERE IS THE HEALTH INSPECTOR!!! I asked to speak with a manager, who did not appear like the managerial type. He could see how shocked I am, and still just replied in a quick and couldn't-care-less \"it will be fixed\" comment."}
{"text":"I was invited by Kris to attend an event. The group was quite welcoming.  Ordered a few appetizers and a coke. The wings I found to be a bit dry, unlike juicy wings that I have had at other places.  The servers are great as they do come to check up on you and even bring you a refill before you can ask for it.  I'm assuming that because we were there early on Thursday it was not packed, however when we were leaving, the dining room started to pick up."}
{"text":"I have this place a 3 star because it costed me $20 for a chicken salad for lunch. Com'on! $20 for a salad for lunch?! This place way too overpriced. The food is good but in my opinion it's not worth the money."}
{"text":"This place is grossly over priced.   Wing and rib combo comes with 3 wings for 24 bucks.  Worst I've ever seen. You'd be better off going to the Dave and Busters or the Boston Pizza."}
{"text":"The bad:  Wings were bad.  Burgers were frozen Washrooms were absolutely filthy (think club) We asked for Wendell sized beer and were told because the glasses weren't cleaned we couldnt get it ...dude clean your glasses Food overall was very mediocre Visa machine didn't work p roperlly Ugh. Overall this was the worst pub bar we've been too. For crying out loud clean your washroom"}
{"text":"Sadly disappointing visit 2 weeks ago.  Taste of Brampton was happening and because we are late to that most of the vendors were out of food or packed solid.  So we decided to try this place.  Looks great from outside, nice welcome but then it went sideways.  Were taken to a table that had people sitting at it, we didn't have a reservation but shouldn't the front desk know it was occupied?  After they got the couple to move I asked for the table to be wiped, I used a napkin after the hostess disappeared.  Waiter seemed nice but once he got the drink order he became vapour for 15 minutes.   We ordered apps and dinner at the same time just in case he disappeared again.   Apps were mediocre, just past warm and not worth the price.   Mains were not fair value, barely half a breast of chicken  in my stir fry and my friends pasta was very small.  We asked for parmesan and they brought a side cup with dried grated cheese, how cheap is that?   A $20 main and dried bagged cheese?    Overall there are 5 other places nearby with better value and that don't have deafening music."}
