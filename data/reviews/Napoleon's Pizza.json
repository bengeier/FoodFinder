{"text":"Been a customer for years! However the last year the pizza has gotten cheap.  We eat the whole pizza (and we are not fat) and the toppings are slim. We even ordering extra toppings and were disappointed. When you pay $20 for a pizza you don't expect to eat the whole thing and still be hungry! Any other pizza place we have a good 1/2 a pizza left and are stuffed!  Good pizza ( since we like sweet sauce )! Too bad their way too conservative on their toppings, even when you pay for extra toppings! Stingiest pizza shop around! Every single time we get it it's gets skimpier!! I can understand cheap on the meat, but how much is onion, barely any of that either!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!  After trying most of the pizza shops in Parma, I have to say this is one of the best.  Food is fresh and tastes great.  Delivery is quick.  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"They put no sauce on at all, the sweet sauce was the weirdest sauce I ever tasted, nasty..... Tasted like water sugar and a few teaspoons of red sauce to give it a hint of pink..TERRIBLE PIZZA"}
{"text":"I have eaten many pizzas from here, they are always great!  But the best part is their sweet sauce which you can't get anywhere else that I am aware of.  I recommend highly!"}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza and service! ingredients were fresh and covered the entire pizza!! Crust was perfectly cooked and great texture, sauce is sweet and has great flavor!"}
{"text":"Napoleon's offers up a solid pie made in the traditional pan style found at most pizzerias here in Cleveland. I thought the toppings were the star here. The pepperoni and sausage were very flavorful and the cheese and sauce were applied in a good proportion.

For pan style pizza I found the dough to be a little \"blonde\" or underdone for my taste. In the future I would recommend a little more time in the oven. I'm sure they would be happy to accommodate an order for a \"well done\" pizza. Napoleon's offers a good value for what you pay and what you get. I plan on going again.

Note: after being 'dinner only' for a long time, they are now open for lunch."}
{"text":"Have had napoleons multiple times and absolutely love it. My husband loves the sweet sauce and I love the regular sauce. They have messed up our order before, but made us a new pizza and came back to give it to us because of the mistake. Love them!!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Parma, hands down...fast friendly pick up or delivery service, coupled with an eclectic menu of specialty pizzas, along with build-your-own options.  Pick up their loyalty card and get a free pizza after ten orders."}
{"text":"Good pizza but it's 8:35 I just called to order and they said.....\"Thank you for calling Napoleans we are closed\" what pizza shop closes at 8:30pm?"}
{"text":"Wowza! This pizza was good! Came to town for the Indians home opener and stopped here for a quick bite to eat before I filled my tank with booze. But man the BBQ chicken pizza was one of my favorites I've had. Had a Napoleon Conquerer salad to go with the pizza, let me tell ya, this salad had just the right amount of everything to settle this belly. Would recommend! I don't usually post reviews but my experience with Napoleons changed that today!"}
{"text":"Great service and my favorite pizza in town. Doesn't hurt that it's across the street either!"}
{"text":"Yummy pizza (ours was sausage, mushroom, & onion,topped generously); still tasted great reheated in the oven the next night. And delicious, flavorful wings, too (tried the honey mustard; crispy outside, juicy inside). Timely and pleasant delivery on a holiday weekend. Was our first order; won't be our last."}
{"text":"Great sauce great pizza. Not your typical pizza shop. I always try new pizza and change it up but I will never forget this place. Oh and don't forget to get the sweet sauce."}
{"text":"Not sure why I haven't noted this before, but they take all their orders by hand (sans computer) so don't expect to order quickly. Prices are slightly higher than their competition, but not by too much.

That said, the staff is always very nice and helpful. 

I can confirm that their Chicago deep dish pizza is excellent and authentic. Break out your forks for this one. Wings are pretty good but the spicy bbq sauce is anything but that. Maybe they gave us the wrong sauce? Not that big of a deal. Their regular crust pizza is fairly good as well.

As always, if you are paying by card you have to tell them when you place the order. Yes, they ask if you want to tip the driver ahead of time."}
{"text":"Consistently great pizza. Great quality for the price and the staff is great. Highly recommended. Also they have a stamp card that will get you a free pizza!"}
{"text":"Well, after many years of patronage yesterday, we were scammed. Ordered the Monday special which was a large one topping for 6.99 like we normally do, and I was handed a xl for $10! That's not what we ordered. Kid said \" yeah that's the special xl for $10\" called home asking why I wasn't told that the special had changed. I was told \" I swear I asked for the Monday special, I had no idea it change\" 
Congrats Naps. You just lost years of patronage."}
{"text":"The truth is in the sauce and dough of Napoleon's Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza. It is Two Layers of Dough, Stuffed with 3 Items & a FULL POUND of Cheese, Sauce, and MORE CHEESE.

I can say that this is truly the best Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza that you will find anywhere outside of the State of Illinois. The sauce and dough is pure perfection. I always add a Napoleon Conqueror Salad to my order. 

If you never had a pizza from this restaurant, I highly encourage you to order one today. 

Napoleon's staff, please carry on! My highest recommendation and for those who know me, I never ever lie about food!"}
{"text":"I bought a deluxe pizza at Napoleon's for the first time and it was awesome! I usually get pizza from the large chain pizza places, but that ended tonight. This was easily the best pizza I have had in many years. They do not skimp on the toppings like all the big guys. The crust was perfect, almost bread like. I like a lot of sauce and this could use a little more. Next time I will ask for more. But I can't stress enough how good their pizza is compared to big chains. Try it once and you will be hooked."}
{"text":"We are in Cleveland for a volleyball tournament and decided to try Napoleons Pizza based on the 4.5 star reviews. This pizza was a huge disappointment!Mediocre pizza at best. Very doughy, very few toppings. 3 pieces of pepperoni and 2 mushrooms per piece - really?!?"}
{"text":"Decent pizza but not nearly enough sauce. Delivery was on time, but they tack on a $2 delivery fee - which was 15% of our order. I doubt the whole fee goes to the driver. Would have rather given the fee directly to a tip to the delivery guy.

Taste is good, the cheese is the right amount of greasy/salty without being overdone and what sauce was on there was a little sweeter as they claim and tasty. It's a doughy/chewy style pizza which I personally like and was pretty on point with the other local pizza places around Old Brooklyn. 

Would give 4-stars if they'd drop the delivery fee and let us give it to the person actually delivering. If I ordered again I'd ask for extra sauce."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've tasted has come from here. I've had their pizza about 15 times over the years, and about 14/15 times it was amazing. The 1 time that it wasn't was when the pizza was burned, but that wasn't a problem since we got a new one right away without questions asked.

I always get a large sheet pizza with sausage. I've tried their sweet pizza, which is a cheese pizza with sweet sauce, and that was breathtaking. I've also tried pepperoni, olives, pineapple, and just regular cheese. All have been great. Oh, and those things called \"salads\" are good too :P

If I ever want to order a great pizza, it comes from here. Not P Jay's, not Domino's, not  Papa Johns.....here. Although if you want a really sheet pizza, you go to P Jay's"}
{"text":"The stromboli at Napoleon's is my comfort food.  Unlike the average strom, its long and wide and perfect for slicing to share... but I never do.  My roommate knows to never touch the leftovers of this great meal.  Go for the hot peppers because they blend well and don't overpower.  I personally love the tomato slices (included) and I add mushrooms to complete it.  A Super Salad makes a great combo and my only complaint is that they got rid of the homemade italian dressing when the new owners took over.  The deep dish is also a treat.  Its worth a try if you want a new favorite."}
{"text":"While wrapping up a recent vacation, my family and I picked ordered a couple of pizzas from Napoleon's Pizza to eat at our hotel room for the night in Cleveland. A miscommunication during the ordering process was realized when I went to pick up the pizzas and only one pizza was on the order. The staff was happy to throw the forgotten cheese pizza in the oven as quick as possible and even delivered the goods to us car-side when ready.

We all shared a side order of bread sticks with marinara sauce ($4.75 for 6). While these appeared to be cooked from frozen, the dusting of seasoning on top was a nice touch. My family of four had no problem taking down the full order, though even one stick per person would be a good start to any meal.

My preschool aged kids had no complaints with their small cheese pizza ($6.75). My wife and I split a large deluxe pizza with pepperoni, mushroom, green pepper, onion, and sausage ($16.50). The toppings were of great quality and were very plentiful. The sauce was on the sweeter side, though I'm told they have an even sweeter sauce available per request. I was very happy with Napoleon's and wouldn't hesitate to order their pizza again."}
{"text":"Making my way around the local pizza scene, I decided to order some Napoleon's recently. We ordered a large with mushroom, pepperoni, green peppers, onions, and sausage and a large cheese and pepperoni for delivery. The pizza was delivered on time and the driver was friendly. 

Upon opening the white boxes, the pizzas looked excellent! I let them cool off as they were still piping hot. My first bite revealed an excellent taste! Great pizza, I thought! And it was...bite after bite. I really liked it and I would definitely order again. I tasted the pepperoni pizza and it was good too. 

The sauce was slightly sweet and there was a good amount on each pie. The toppings were fresh and excellent. I especially liked the sausage and mushroom. 

There were two drawbacks that I noted.  One is price. For two large pizzas, we shelled out $30. The second drawback is the size. These large pizzas are the size of what other pizza shops in the area list as medium.

We'll be back eventually!"}
{"text":"The delivery driver arrived way earlier than they were supposed to during the browns game. The pizza was extra hot. It was a little greasy for my liking but I still ate it :D"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area. You have to order the sweet sauce though, that's where it's all at! We actually had a pizza tasting party where everyone brought a pizza from a different place in the Cleveland area and we had a lot of good places in there (angelos, deweys, Danny boys, jets, edisons) but Napoleons with the sweet sauce came out on top and was most people's favorite!  A must try!"}
{"text":"Pizza is my favorite weekend food. It is cheap, lasts all three days in the fridge and usually prevents a hangover if I eat it before I go to sleep. I drove out to State Rd in Parma where there seems to be a pizza shop on every block. The sauce is not too sweet and has a nice balanced taste. The cheese reminds me of Rocco's Pizza in Stow. I think I will be driving here more often to pick up pizza. It is definitely way better than anything in Tremont and holds its own against Angelo's, Danny Boys or any of the other over hyped west side pizza places. I highly recommend trying it. The box is also pretty cool. It has a cartoon drawing of Napoleon and says \"We conquer taste buds\"."}
{"text":"The quality is evident when you bite into one of these pizzas.

Out of 20 years getting stuff from these guys, and living right down the street from the owner, I would say I have never had a bad experience, that is quite the tract record.

Thanks Napoleon's Pizza!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in Parma.  The toppings are great, crust, sauce, and cheese are all flavorful.  I have never had a bad pizza here.  Also, the customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"I have been to Napoleon's a couple times.  It is adequate pizza.  Nothing exceptional, just average pizza.  Nowhere to eat in the store, so takeout only.  It is better than any chain, and the price is ok."}
{"text":"If you are a person who respects the beauty of a perfect pizza pie when the crust to cheese to sauce to toppings ratio is just right, then look no further than Napoleon's. These folks get it and you can taste the attention to detail with every bite. Great pizza. Great people. This is Cleveland pizza."}
