{"text":"My experience here was so poor that I'm actually writing my first ever Yelp review.

We were seated right away (party of two) on a late Friday morning. Our food took ONE HOUR to arrive from the time we ordered. They were not slammed, at no point did the server come over to at least acknowledge the fact that the food was taking so long, and when it finally did arrive, my waffle crepes were room temperature, as was my boyfriend's waffle. 

Coffee: so weak that I couldn't even drink it.
Bathrooms: dirty and no soap in dispenser
Food: hard to say since it wasn't served warm, but everything tasted fine. Food runner asked what kind of syrup I wanted, gave me three options, brought me the one I didn't pick. Which whatever, syrup is syrup, but it was super watery. Not good. 

We were on a 3 day trip and decided to skip the complimentary breakfast for one morning to treat ourselves to a delicious brunch while staying in Pittsburgh. So annoyed that we wasted that experience at this breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this unique little breakfast spot on a Saturday morning after a business trip.  What a find! Although waffles are featured, they have some unusual omelet and egg dishes. I found the service to be top notch--friendly and prompt.  It can get kind of noisy when busy and some  tables are pretty close together, but overall a great experience.  Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch in PGH!  Had the carnivore omelette.  Let me put this in perspective for everyone, this omelette had all the meats your stomach and heart could desire, AND THEN they top it with an over easy egg, sided with a healthy serving of tri-colored potatoes.  Should have got a waffle,  what am I doing with my life...."}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about, but I would say there are other restaurants that serve up pretty much the same things as Waffles Incaffeinated.  So, unless I was in the area or lived nearby, I probably wouldn't come back.

The menu is a decent size, but I did expect to see more inventive and varied uses of the waffle, considering this is the premise of the restaurant.  There's basically two kinds of sweet waffles (berries or a combo of bananas and chocolate) or a few savory waffles (a normal breakfast with a waffle thrown in).  The waffles themselves are also nothing spectacular.  It almost tasted like the waffles were just microwaved.  They weren't golden brown or with that nice crisp crust, but instead more soft and chewy.  

Now for the positives, as I did, overall, enjoy my meal there.  The service is quick and you can use the \"No Wait\" app to put yourself on the waitlist."}
{"text":"The food was just okay. We ordered to go- the home fries were awful. They are not your traditional home fries by any means and they are terrible.  The waffle was decent."}
{"text":"Never came to refill my coffee...

Ordered a waffle and an omlet, took them 40 minutes. The shop was not even that busy.

Food was OK. But the wait is just bad."}
{"text":"I came here about a month ago because I heard great things. I was lucky and didn't have to wait for a table but mannnn when we got our table we waited alright! :) 

It took close to an hour for two orders of waffles to be filled. I will say, even though it took forever, that was the best waffle I had in my life. My guest said the same thing! I ordered the Souther Waffle. 

I definitely plan on going back, I just need to pick a day that I have a lot of free time!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was so yummy!  Chicken and waffles (were light and fluffy) were great, my son got the French toast and he really enjoyed it was well. Nice atmosphere and great service. Great coffee as well!  Feel it's a must visit while in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great food ... But there were 3 issues
1. You can not creat your own omelet 
2. Slow services 
3. Little bit pricy"}
{"text":"Just what we were looking for - speciality Waffles! We will definitely be return customers! Went on a weekday morning and avoided the crowds. 2 Hour delay equals wafflesincaffeniated!"}
{"text":"On first impression, the new location in Wexford was at most a one star. Doubt I'll visit this place again or any of their other locations. 

After being seated, it was 15 minutes before we were greeted. We placed our drink and food orders and received the drinks a long 10 minutes later. The waitress apologized and told us the restaurant could only make one latte at a time and there were several drink orders ahead of ours. As happy as I was to finally have a hot drink after freezing in the cold weather, I was instantly let down because the coffees were nearly cold. 

The food came shortly after and the waffles were soft, definitely pre-made and had been sitting under a warmer. On a better note, the food still tasted good but the background noise of the waitress continuously apologizing to other customers was a pure indicator that this place was a terrible mess...at least this particular Sunday afternoon. 

Won't go back...Totin's down the street is a better choice."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Chicken and waffles with bourbon syrup is delicious. Banana frita for desert was awesome"}
{"text":"Honestly the waffles aren't that special. Overpriced and I'm still left hungry afterwards. The home fries are amazing though. There is always a long wait- not worth it"}
{"text":"We got here at noon and had to wait until 1 for a table then ordered and the food didn't get to the table until 1:45. One hour and 45 mins for painfully mediocre food. To add insult to injury, our server forgot our utensils so we couldn't eat our food until the utensils were fetched. The food is not that great. There is no reason it took 45 mins to cook. They didn't offer an appetizer to make up for the waiting time or whatever. Food looked sad when it arrived. Nothing I couldn't have made at home myself. Never ever coming here again!!! Don't come here. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for the first time this morning. She had the BC Breakfast while I ordered Crepes with cream cheese and blueberries. It took nearly 45 minutes before we were served the breakfast. (To be fair, the restaurant had a large number of patrons.) My wife found her breakfast quite satisfying. I wish I could say the same about my crepes which were small and leathery, the toughest crepes I have ever had. The blueberries were tasteless, the creme cheese sparse. The presentation on a large square plate made the crepes look even smaller. The coffee cups were also small, certainly the smallest I have ever used in a breakfast restaurant. My wife found the over-easy eggs satisfying, and considered the home-fried potatoes among the best-tasting of any she's had in a restaurant. Because the restaurant was crowded, the noise level made conversation difficult."}
{"text":"I must say, Waffles Incaffinated is my new favorite brunch spot. Service is spot on, food comes up quickly, and if you go during peak brunch times, a wait is never a problem because the restaurant will text you when your table is ready. I find this super cool and super smart, considering the location of the restaurant in Southside Works. While you wait, you can grab a coffee elsewhere, or take a stroll around the block without feeling like you're wasting your time in line. 

Definitely get the Redneck Benny. It is to die for. Everyone else in our group was also super satisfied with their food as well."}
{"text":"Best waffles!!! What makes it even better is they will basically let you create anything you want! I was stuck between a few choices...and the server made it easy by saying lets combine the both together and you know what...BOOM! Perfection!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, terrible service. Consistently understaffed and super slow. Have your order ready to go when you sit down because otherwise you'll be there all day. Drink your water and coffee slow because you'll get one refill if any:"}
{"text":"Everything was served hot and fresh. Our waitress, Elanor was very nice and friendly. Overall, a great experience. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Not a fan, service sucked, got served dry toast, a stuck together lump of bacon, not impressed, not returning."}
{"text":"I gave this place 3 chances because it is so close to my apartment but I won't be going back. The food and decor is nice. However the service has really ruined this place for me.
I do not mind waiting a half hour for a table on a Sunday morning. However waiting 45minutes after placing your food order is unacceptable. We were literally starving by the time we got our food.

I ordered the French toast and a side of eggs. The French toast came with a nice butter however there was only a teaspoon size dollop on the side of the plate. I asked for some more and was informed it was a dollar extra. I showed them what a small amount they had given me yet was still charged for an extra topping. On top of this the service was very robotic and snarky. It really is ashame because the food is pretty good but I won't be going back. Also if you get a group on, read the fine print. Only good mon-fri."}
{"text":"Plan on using the NoWait app to get in line before you go on the weekend, otherwise, plan on a huge wait! It was chaotic here on a Saturday morning because there is such limited seating. I tried the MegaBerry waffle and it was good! This is a \"fancier\" breakfast joint... definitely not your typical \"greasy spoon\" type of place that I prefer for breakfast, but for what it is, it's not bad!"}
{"text":"The service has went down hill. My food has been cold the past 3 times I went there. The waitress had an attitude when I asked her to heat it up. It's crazy because I LOVED this place when they first opened. Now I hardly want to go there."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend, but sadly don't think I'll be back The staff was friendly and the service was ok, but the food was disappointing. I had the chicken and waffles and my girl had the French toast.  When the food came out and the waitress sat it down, I was disappointed.  I kinda felt like....That's it? Here was this giant plate with a little waffle and a couple of chicken tenders on it. The french toast was the same. The waffle was ok at best, nothing great by any means, and the few chicken tenders were fried well and tasted ok. The French toast was absolutely bland. The accompanying topping helped, but there definitely wasn't enough of it. After being about half way finished the waitress offered some of there flavored syrups. I wish we had known about them earlier as they did help add a little flavor. We went with the bourbon syrup and it made it easier to finish the meal. All in all, I would suggest trying somewhere else. I know I won't be back"}
{"text":"I went here with my husband to have breakfast and really enjoyed their food. My husband mentioned how popular the place was and on week ends there is a line outside of their door - food is that good.

I have twins and got stuck at home. I didn't want to bother bringing the babies with me (it would be disruptive to the other patrons) and plus it was raining. I called and a man picked up - did not catch his name (jeremy, maybe?). I asked if I could put in a take out order. He hung up on me. I called again, thinking we got disconnected. He picked up again and after I asked once more about take out, he hung up on me. 

If they don't do take out or if they were too busy, just say so. Hanging up on potential business does not make sense. Your food is great, but unfortunately, the people you have working for you aren't that great. I'm sure there are a lot of people out there that would still give you business, but I don't believe in continuing to spend my money at a place where it's clear that people don't mind being rude. I schedule a number of events and a large part of my job is recommending places to people - this restaurant just got taken off the list."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today and it was AMAZING!! I had the waffle foster and it was delicious, very rich in flavor with the perfect compliment of vanilla bean ice cream and my husband had the carnivore omelette which was PERFECTLY cooked with these delicious and colorful home fries (purple, orange, white potatoes with a ranch seasoning). Our server Brittany was as sweet as pie, literally and every person we came in contact with with was awesome. Very impressed!! Do expect a 45+ minute wait on the weekends but you can get in line using the nowait app to save you some time. Definitely go check this place out."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. So many different options on the menu it's hard to decide what to get. I do recommend looking on Nowait to get yourself in line before you head there"}
{"text":"Good waffles, but people with nut allergies BEWARE. Told them I have a severe nut allergy but they said they only use one waffle iron and there is nothing they can do. It wasn't busy, at all when I went. I'm sure they could of cleaned it. I hate places that take nut allergies lightly.  I'm sticking to Coco café my favorite place!!"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place from several people I wanted to try it myself!  The place had a few folks that were dining, no wait to sit.  It was around noon. I was torn between breakfast and lunch. I decided to get \"Chicken and Waffles\"  after a short wait my food arrived. I should add I did not get the pecans that were supposed to come on them.  Anywho I got the maple syrup that the waiter recommended. The waffle was light and fluffy with a nice crisp.  Nothing to write home about.  The chicken.. was extremely hard.  They were the chicken strips breaded. I honestly Felt like Chevy Chase in Christmas vacation eating that burnt turkey.  Three pieces came with it. ALL three pieces were way over cooked.  I had to say something to the waitress. Her response surprising. She said \"yea we get that a lot,  most people  soak it in maple syrup to soften it up\" I'm like are you serious?  She continued \"it gets hard sitting under heat lamps,  when I have it I really gotta tear into it with a knife\" hold up?  Its chicken strips a knife shouldn't be involved. I make fried chicken strips all the time and I NEVER have that problem. This place gets two stars from me based on the \"Leather\" Chicken strips and the \"I know this and it sucks\" tude about the chicken."}
{"text":"Decent.  Some creativity with the waffles, and other waffle-iron-cooked items, but generally in the \"more is better\" school.  Huge portions of pretty good food."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! Waffles Incaffeinated has a ton of cool waffle options, but there are other options on the menu to choose from as well.  It was kind of a long a wait (a little over an hour) but that was to be expected on a Sunday for brunch. Luckily, we were able to use the NoWait app to save us a place in line. If you don't have the app, I'd highly recommend it. 

****Just a note: as of 5/23/16, the prices listed on Yelp are incorrect. In case anyone is worried about prices before they go, it's mostly just a dollar more expensive on everything, sometimes a little more and sometimes a little less. 

While Waffles Incaffeinated is a little expensive, I definitely think it was worth it. I got the monthly special for May, Raspberry Foray, and it was delicious. I was slightly bummed I didn't get the advertised edible orchid, but unfortunately they had ran out. 

The employees were helpful and efficient. Everyone in my party enjoyed their meals, and we definitely plan on visiting again! If you love waffles and breakfast food, then you need to try this place at least once."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 5 stars for the food and 1 star for the efficiency. We have been there maybe half a dozen times since discovering them a few months ago, and it's the same every time: amazing food, but you have to wait *forever* for it to arrive. Today we arrived at 9, no wait, we ordered pretty quickly, and it was after 10 before our food arrived. I've seen lots of kids melting down (today I saw 2 getting carried out in tears -- luckily mine are pretty patient and I bring snacks to tide them over). The servers have always been super nice. Today's even apologized for the wait and thanked us for being polite about it. I guess not everybody is. 

The food: now, that's why we keep coming back. They have an enormous create-your-own list, so you can basically just get whatever you want. And it's always delicious. I usually get an omelet because their home fries are to die for. 

I don't know if their kitchen is just too small or what, but the long wait time is seriously a problem."}
{"text":"Nice decor, slow service, interesting menu, bad waffles.
We had high expectation for this place because of the ambitious menu. I don't think you can find savory waffle dishes with fried chicken or egg Benedict elsewhere in Pittsburgh. The Jack Daniels maple syrup they offer for the savory waffles was wonderful too. But the waffles themselves are pathetically thin and soft and very bland tasting. I \"made my own\" waffle with pico de gallo and chedder cheese, my husband had banana and pecan. Neither of us find the texture or flavor interesting. The decor was fun and clean, service was friendly but slow. I agree with the previous reviewer this place is over-rated. A traditional diner waffle is a lot better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Worst waffles EVER!!!! I don't recommend this place at all!!! The services was extremely slow and the waffles were sooooo soggy and chewy that i don't want to remember. I will not return."}
{"text":"Visited here with a friend after waking up a little dazed and confused in the southside. I ordered the chicken and waffles and my friend got the Croque Monsieur. While I didn't taste his dish he said he thoroughly enjoyed it, and it looked pretty appetizing to boot. As for my food it was pretty awesome. A rather large fluffy waffle with several pieces of boneless fried chicken tenders with a really good breading. There were also scallions and pecans strewn about the dish, which I really enjoyed. I also tried the sweet potato fries with marshmallow jerk dipping sauce. Everything was very tasty and there is no doubt waffles inc is a must visit if you are in the southside."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Wexford! Sausage gravy will never be the same. Bennys? Killer! Potatoes completely reimagined. And even roast tomatoes on the side. I was loving it all. To top it off, the coffee was robust and flavorful. Try a latte or two..."}
{"text":"The place was packed and the wait was a bit long but the food was excellent and the server was really great. Good location too, we sat outside and it was shady and a nice day. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in the new Wexford location on a Saturday morning around 9:30am.  It wasn't packed yet, but by 10:00 there was a line out the door.  The food was absolutely delicious, but lukewarm.  The coffee mugs are definitely too small (hello, there's a coffee mug in your logo!) and the waitress was too busy to stop for refills.  We sat with empty cups for about 20 minutes, finally stopping her as she raced by and asked for the refill.  A simple carafe on the table would solve this problem. In the end, we only had two small cups of coffee. Our food sat under the warmer for at least 10 minutes. I watched them plate it and then watched it sit there. Finally my husband got up and approached the window, asking if we have to take our own food.  It would behoove the owner to hire some kids from the high school to have them bus, pour coffee, and deliver food.  Clearly the waitresses are too busy to be on top of these kinds of things during peek times. We waited awhile for our check to be delivered, too. The waitresses all seemed to be very friendly, but they were overwhelmed. Our visit took 90 minutes, which is a long time to spend at breakfast. Hiring some teenagers who can hustle could potentially cut a table's occupancy time in half."}
{"text":"I have heard good things about this place but I couldn't confirm those myself. I noticed that when they wiped off the tables they just pushed all the food bits onto the floor and they set the menus down before the tables dried so they had the smell of cleaner. 

The menu sounds amazing but it mostly falls a bit short. I ordered the fosters waffles and they were ok. I also got sweet potato waffle fries and they were nice band crispy. However the marshmallow dip that comes with them is awful. Plus it is not really something you can dip a fry into because it's so firm. I think they should reconsider this sauce. My husband ordered the blt sandwich. He thought it was fine except for the special seasoning they dusted the outside with. 

Our waitress was so miserable. She seemed to disappear after the initial how is your food check and so I waited about 15 minutes to ask for syrup. After another 5 minutes, she still hadn't returned and so my husband went and asked her again.

Our clothes wreaked of grease when we left. I wish it had been a better experience but I don't think I could even give it a second chance. I would recommend hiring more competent staff and revisiting the menu options. It is a good concept but poor delivery. And I really love waffles so I'm pretty sad about the experience."}
{"text":"Giving an extra star because the waffles and home fries were excellent, and the inside of the place is nice.

This was my second visit, and I'm actually glad that I waited to leave a review. My girlfriend and I came in at 1:22 PM on a Wednesday. First thing the hostess says was, \"You're going to be our last table of the day! I was going to say no, but you seem nice!\" ...Okay, awkward...but...okay.

Before eating, she yelled \"Promise this is the last one,\" to the cooks. ....okay.

While eating, we were forced to listen to the hostess and a server celebrate their approaching off days, and complain about how much they do not like working...all while sitting at a table 10 feet away from us....cleaning the day's utensils...in the middle of the dining area. Then, the hostess went ahead and sprayed/wiped every table in the place, while we were eating...even more awkward.

And, to ice the cake...she asked if we wanted ketchup, we said yes, and she just never brought it...lol. This was the least of my worries, but hey, it happened.

0/5 on the service, 5/5 on the food. I rounded down to a 2 because my overall experience was complete garbage. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"What a treat. It was crazy busy the day we were there but the service was very nice and the food was amazing. You must get the potatoes"}
{"text":"I ordered the Benny and it was absolutely delicious! I also got a side of bacon and they were cooked to perfection. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because our wait for the food seemed to be a little longer than it should've been. It may have taken about 30 mins for our food to arrive and it wasn't that busy when we were there."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with a few of my friends early Saturday afternoon, and it was very delicious! I've heard a lot of great things about this place, and thought it would be great to take friend who was visiting Pittsburgh for the first time. He thoroughly enjoyed it :)

-Funky Monkey Waffles: I would only recommend getting this if you have a HUGE sweet tooth. The waffles themselves weren't sweet, but the added chocolate syrup and huge lump of peanut butter in the middle of my waffles definitely gave me a sugar high afterwards. I liked how they didn't incorporate anything sweet into the waffles. By adding all the sweet ingredients on top, it allowed me to control how much sweetness I wanted to add to my waffles. Highly recommended!

-Foster's: My one girlfriend ordered this and she said it was very good. Not too heavy, and just the right amount of bananas on her waffles.

-Southern Waffles: My friend from out of town ordered this and he said it was definitely for those who like savory foods. It looked and smelled incredible though - definitely ordering the next time I go!

For Coffee Lovers: Bottomless coffee for $2! Definitely a steal :)

Tip: This place doesn't take reservations, but if you have an iPhone, you can wait in line by adding your name and party through the 'No Wait' application. I did this and we were seated almost immediately once we got there. If I hadn't reserved my place in line, we would have had to wait for at least 45 minutes, so this was definitely a huge time saver!

The only con I could see was when I called to ask if they took reservations, the person on the phone was very rude and hung up on me before I finished asking my questions. My waiter however was extremely nice and helpful - so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt this time around :)"}
{"text":"Best waffles in the history of waffles. Such an interesting place."}
{"text":"Came with some friends from out of town- great food at reasonable prices. Everyone walked away happy and full. Like everyone else said- there is a wait so be prepared. Service was good, we sat outside but the inside is cool. Will be returning and recommending!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. Service was prompt.  Everything was super clean.  They are very flexible with special orders. Gluten free available. 

Make sure to sign in with the nowait app before you leave the house."}
{"text":"We've been in for breakfast numerous times and have never been disappointed. I personally love the BLT (with an added fried egg). It's absolutely delicious!! The wait staff is always friendly and accommodating. It's definitely worth the wait if you need to."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever encountered. Food was mediocre, but not worth a 90 min wait. Hostess was extremely rude, and waitress was absurdly sarcastic. Apparently out of town folk are discriminated against in this establishment."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Pittsburgh.  The food and service is excellent and it's a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hoopla is about. Simple waffle place with a variety of mix-ins. The service was so so. The servers aren't the sweetest. Very blah and matter of fact.  Maybe it's the fact I'm a southerner and I expect people to be a certain way. There were several messy tables that were eventually cleaned. The waffle I got was one with bacon. I kept it simple because if you can do simple well then the rest is \"gravy\". I was not impressed. Simple standard fair. I've had a lot better."}
{"text":"A group of four of us visited, two ordering savoury waffles and two ordering sweet. Everyone was satisfied! The menu was huge and interesting, with a lot of great flavor combinations. They even have a build your own section if you don't like any of the suggested options. Everything was cooked nicely and tasted good. Service was a little slow but it was pretty busy. All around a positive experience and we would go back."}
{"text":"I fail to understand the apparent fascination with this establishment.  I have been to WI on three separate occasions (being that I live a stone's throw away), and each time I have come away dissatisfied and wondering why I bothered in the first place.

They do not allow substitutions on their BC Breakfast, so I hope you like tomatoes and sauteed mushrooms as your sides with eggs and toast.

The omelettes are OK, if small - the hashbrowns are also decent, but were undercooked.  Purple potatoes are not that impressive if they aren't prepared properly.

On my last (and final) visit, I got Breakfast Magic, which had the potential to be at least a good (if not great) dish, if it weren't for that fact that the egg to waffle ratio was way off.  I need more than one yolk to help add some moisture to a dry and salty dish.

The coffee is worse than what I make at home and is served in a cup approximately the size of a thimble, which means that you are going to need it refilled about 3-4 times during a normal meal.

The service is acceptable and the decor is fine - they must have had a huge sale on the color green.  But none of these things make up for the fact that the food is overpriced and, despite their create your own omelette/waffle menu, very limited in choice.  On all three occasions my wife got various types of waffles (the last being the seasonal pumpkin/fig/cranberry monstrosity), and each time she was very disappointed in the meal.

There are better breakfast choices in Southside and the surrounding areas."}
{"text":"I think this place needs some kind of intervention. 

The term 'sui generis' is on the menu,  not just once, but TWICE.  In case you don't know Latin, which most people don't, it means \"of its own kind\" - I had to look it up, too.

Yelp helped me find this place, so I'm returning the favor.  Other Sunday brunch times, we've driven past and saw a line out the door.  It wasn't out the door today and that's good because it's chilly out.  When we got inside, the host's back was to us, because we were instructed to go in through a side door, which I assume is meant to keep people from gathering near tables, but it's just not welcoming to walk into a place where the person I'm supposed to interface with has his back turned to me.
Gratuitous technology in restaurants also can drive me nuts.  There was a wait and I was offered to receive a text message when our table was ready.  Red flag for two reasons: I'm going to bet that goes into a database somewhere, and where am I supposed to go to wait? Across the street for some hookah?  Maybe this would be fine in warmer weather, but it also seems like a great way to lose a sale by causing people to wait elsewhere.

I ordered the signature savory waffle, the one with bacon, green onions, cheddar cheese and a fried egg.  It was GREAT.  I really enjoyed it, it was something different, tasty, and I was able to finish the portion.  The egg was also cooked to order well, something I consider to be hard to do, especially during a busy period.  My dining partner had a plain waffle and enjoyed that, and we both liked the sides of ham and home fries (many additional points for using a medley of potatoes, which was colorful and tasty!).  The presentation was lovely, too.

Overall, the food is good and shows a commitment to high quality product.  

So it's too bad that we had a ridiculously long wait for our food on during a brunch service that wasn't even particularly busy.  And then the hair my dining partner found on her plate?  Unacceptable.  First, we were offered a 20% discount, then our whole meal was comped because the waitstaff were so frustrated with the kitchen.  

That's where the intervention comes in.  Management, leave the cooking to the professionals, and STAY OUT of the kitchen (maybe even the restaurant - watch what goes on through the fancy POS system and iPads everywhere) -- otherwise, you're going to continue to hemorrhage money when you have to give discounts or comps.  If you want to stay in the kitchen, there's probably always prep work and cleaning to be done.  Or focus on finding ways to improve the people flow so that I don't walk in to the host's back.

It's hard to say if I'd return or not - because while I really enjoyed my meal, I don't know if the food was good enough for me to be patient and tolerant of the obvious management issues next time."}
{"text":"Overrated. The waffles were not that good (avoid the sausage and gravy waffle at all costs) and the service wasn't stellar either. Like other yelpers I also noticed the fly issue they seem to have...

The only reason I didn't give them one star is because their coffee was decent. If you want a great breakfast, head over to dor-stop."}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast. Usually come on a Saturday and Sunday morning with my roommate. I almost always get the Souther' Waffle....it is amazing. The bourbon syrup they provide for it is to die for. 

Really like how they do there waiting system, we usually walk around a little bit waiting for their text message to tell us the table is ready. Never really have had a long wait, its always been shorter than what they've told us. 

Service is fast and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Their Waffles with Sausage Gravy are too.die.for!!!  I didnt think waffles and sausage gravy mixed, but I took a chance cause my love of gravy trumps pretty much everything (aside from Music).  It's so rich, flavorful, and full of thyme and basil.  I would shout \"YUM!\" as loud as I could in the restaurant, but I'm sure it would startle everyone as I'm super loud in general.  

The coffee is adequate, the other menu items are ok.  For example, I got their multicolored potatoes/friend potatoes/whatchamacallits, and they are delicious when they make them hot and give me the Sri Racha.  You have to ask for salt and pepper, or hot sauce or ketchup in this joint, so be prepared for that.  Some of the servers are awesome, friendly and prompt, but I hope you don't have the displeasure of getting this one server who apparently can't be bothered to work or pretend that he wants customers in the restaurant.  The seating at the front could be better organized, and it's kinda cramped in place.  It it pretty clean.

It's kinda loud in here as there is no carpeting or buffering of the noise, but it does look like an upscale diner in decor.  The artwork is corny, but who cares, you haven't had your coffee by the time you get there.

I do feel the dishes are a bit overpriced, but everything is in South Side Works.  I feel it's the best breakfast place in that part of town, and there aren't many to choose from aside from the pricey place across the street or up the hill at Denise's Diner (of which I approve).  

Takeaway from the above:  get the waffles with sausage gravy.  I lick the plate everytime."}
{"text":"Great concept, good coffee and always attentive, friendly service. Interesting selection of menu choices with sweet and savory selections. I would like it a lot more with healthy meat options and meat sides."}
{"text":"In a rush ...... No food in the apt., starving. So I ran here to grab a quick bite. Got seated right away and served really well!  I ordered the chicken and waffles (pecan infused ) and it was great.  The little coffee cups are disappointing until you taste the hometown brewed coffee in them!! Had a great experience. Glad it's so close to the spot!!"}
{"text":"After being open for a month, obviously still a lot to be improved. it took an hour to get food! The cappuccino was mostly milk, not even drinkable, blueberries used in waffle were likely canned. \"House made syrup\" was just sugar water. Eggs and tomatoes were tasty, but not worth the hassles.  They gave us coupons for free meals at the end because it was such a disaster, but we won't go back. Also be aware that there is no diaper changing station."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and found this awesome little waffle place via yelp.  We were here on a Sunday around 10am, the wait was about 20 minutes (which they notify you by text, I love that!)

I had the funky monkey, insanely good!  Great tasting homemade peanut butter, three different syrups to choose from (I had the bourbon) and excellent presentation!
I would highly suggest you check it out!  Wishing I was a local so I could come here every Sunday!"}
{"text":"So good, but super busy on weekends. Haven't had anything less than delicious yet"}
{"text":"Great food, service was worse than terrible...took over 10 min to refresh coffee two times, 35 min after ordering..the food appeared.  \"Sorry\" seemed to be the waiters mantra. I won't be back, even if was free.  (9:30 am was my arrival time.. Standing within 3 feet of the cash register while awaiting seating for 15 minutes, the female attendant never smiled or said hello - set the tone for the next hours bad experience!)"}
{"text":"Met a friend for breakfast. Waited quite awhile for a server to come over, and there were only 4 people in the place. My friend ordered the crepes and I ordered the eggs benedict waffles.
They have background music which is so loud we could hardly speak to each.
Our food was brought by a different server and asked if we wanted more coffee, we both agreed, but once again waited for it. Our original server never came back to check on us, except to bring the bill.
The prices are quite high for the quality of the food. We decided we were glad we tried it, but would not be back."}
{"text":"I came here on their first day of business with a couple friends, one of whom often mentions their shop up in New Brighton. The three of us split three waffles: two savory and one sweet. They were all super tasty. I am pretty new to the world of savory waffles... this is the perfect place for the introduction. The rest of the menu looked great too.

Great service, cool decor. Totally reasonable prices. Can't wait to see it fill up on a Saturday morning!"}
{"text":"It was busy, we waited about 20 minutes for a table. Once we were seated, we received prompt service despite the volume of people. My waffle was amazing!!! I recommend this place and will visit again!"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for a good waffle then by all means try this place. However, the ventilation, or lack off, would ruin even the best food. The place has an over-powering smell of fried food. The smell is so strong that you are reminded of your meal throughout the day; the smell becomes immersed in hair and clothing. The server was very pleasant and prompt. The place is known for waffles, which I suggest you stick to. The $12 omelet was just okay and somewhat lackluster."}
{"text":"Have been here numerous times before and had an overall good experience..... Until today. The service was awful . We stood at the door while we heard the servers stated they had to clean some tables, as one was walking back to the kitchen she had a mouthful of food and decided to check her phone instead of address customers.. After being seated , we were greeted and our orders taken but everyone was getting their food and refills before we even got our food( one waffle and an omelette). After sitting there for 35 minutes I started getting annoyed because it's never been slow like this here, even on a busy morning. Servers were too busy joking and on phones and forgot the fact that customer service is important especially since I also work in the service industry. Just overall disappointed in the visit . Management needs to actually step up and make sure operations run smoothly."}
{"text":"Interesting waffle creations. Last time we had the thanksgiving waffle: infused with chicken and topped with marshmallows, great combo. Tip if you go with someone.  Get one savory waffle, one sweet waffle, and share"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I had lunch with a friend and Harley was an excellent server. They weren't super busy and we did have a few lulls in service but overall had a great experience. I'm a simple eggs over medium girl. The grilled mushrooms & tomatoes are amazing but the real deal are the home fries - yams, purple potatoes, little bit of grilled onions... Incredible! The coffee is good and they have to go cups so you can take some with you. Excellent."}
{"text":"Walked in, waited to be seated, waiters were walking around us as if we're not there, then after a couple of minutes one of them suddenly realized our presence & told us she's gonna help us in a moment. Sat at the table, ordered coffee to start with, coffee was cold, no spoon to stir the coffee, had to ask for a spoon so they brought a dirty spoon (picture included in the review). No napkins on the table neither can be located  anywhere near the table, I guess if you're drinking or eating you won't need any, or may be they bring some with food so they think you may not need it before food arrives. So far not the best experience, let's hope food would be as good as the reviews suggested."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have ever had. I got a custom waffle infused with bacon and chocolate chips topped with chocolate syrup bacon and fried chicken."}
{"text":"Amazing waffles and terrific service but we went on a weekday.  Anyone who puts chorizo and jalapeño in a waffle covered in Bourbon maple syrup deserves 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Host and staff were nice and seated fast but it took over an hour on a Thursday to get our food. Tooooooo loon nnnnggg. It seemed understaffed. We felt guilty asking for jelly, water, etc. It was good but we even had to wait a long while to get the check. 
-The chef doused My daughters kids meal (scrambled eggs) with a huge amount of black pepper. She didn't even touch them but the waiter was so busy we didn't catch him to even mention it."}
{"text":"My little perforated, syrup-filled heart is full every time I come here!

It has great food and it's not too expensive. Mondays they have \"Magic Monday,\" where you can get the breakfast magic waffle (bacon, cheese, egg on top) for $4 (maybe $5? I forget). 

This place also might have my favorite breakfast potatoes in the whole city. Yeah, I said it. They are just like I want them to be: crispy on the outside and pillow-y soft on the inside, just like a french fry. This gal's no fan of soggy home fries. 

Another fave is the P-wedge: a pita grilled like a waffle, slathered in cream cheese and topped with arugula, grilled tomatoes and capicola (I think you can choose other meats though, but why would you want to?!).

Just go, it's delicious. Give them your money."}
{"text":"Really poor service. It took way to long to get our drinks, foods, and checks and it wasn't even crowded. The food was greasy and clearly not well made.

Honestly, it gets worst.
We were seated in a booth by the kitchen, and it smelled disgusting. On top of that, the booth was too high off of the ground and I was wearing a cashmere sweater and I had to lean forward so much that my back ached, and combined with the incredibly long wait, my elbows started to burn because the cashmere was creating a rash from learning over so much.

Also my legs began to ache because they were disproportional to the ground.

I feel like crying."}
{"text":"This place gets extra points for having food I can order for my kids which is not hamburgers and fries. We ordered the kids banana and strawberry crepe, and the chocolate chip waffles. They were a big hit! My wife and I shared at the BC breakfast with blueberry toast. The waiter was very courteous and we were quite impressed overall."}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast spot. Friendly people, good service, very good waffles AND they have some vegan options which is super fun.  It's a cool atmosphere and feels clean. We have eaten there several times and will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The waffles are good and they have a good selection of toppings and fillings. I also liked that they bring a variety of syrups along with them. They have good portion sizes and decent prices too. Service was friendly and attentive.  The restaurant is bright and sunny.
I wasn't the biggest fan of the decor, limited seating, or cleanliness though. Lime green isn't a color I'd want to surround myself with on a regular basis. Also, my arms weren't sticking to the table and my feet weren't sticking to the floors, but they could definitely clean a little better. There was some unidentified dried substances streaked down the tvs and a sticky film on menus and table items."}
{"text":"Yummy-yum-yum-o!! Sausage gravy....breakfast magic...made to order waffles..straw-nana waffles all great. Fast and friendly service and fed 6 adults for $63. Excellent in Pittsburgh! In a great little area to walk around and shop as weel."}
{"text":"Went there around noon today and they were out of waffle batter. It's right there in your name folks. That was unbelievable."}
{"text":"The best waffles I have ever had. Price was a little high, but such an amazing treat. I will be staying away for a bit as I just started a diet, but phenomenal breakfast, they may have something health, but I have low will power and everything I've had was outstanding (and no doubt high in calories)."}
{"text":"i'm usually fine with waiting for good food, but our wait was over an hour. The waitress took ten minutes to visit our table after we were seated, and we waited another half hour after we placed our order.  We also noticed as we waited that this seemed to be the norm. A lot of people were sitting at their tables without food for a very long time. 

To be fair, my review is only based on one experience.  Unfortunately, they probably won't get another chance from me. The waffles are good... but at the end of the day, they're just waffles. Even with the toppings, they're not worth $9+ and certainly not worth waiting nearly two hours.  With all of the fantastic breakfast joints in Pittsburgh, I don't see any reason to return to this one."}
{"text":"Breakfast Magic (cheddar and bacon waffle-goodness) and the Benny (poached eggs with ham and crab on a waffle) were delish! I would have preferred the crabmeat to have been served warmed as part of the sauce rather than chilled, but that's just me. Also, my first poached egg was refrigerator-cold and cooked through and hard to the touch. I understand par-cooking poached eggs, but that was one that wasn't even warmed! It was replaced ASAP with an over-easy egg that was obviously freshly prepared. Our server Jen was so genuinely nice, poised and attentive in the busy swirl of brunch! Love the contemporary interior design especially the combo of chartreuse and black/brown; it was modern and contemporary but still funky and cozy. I really liked the glassware and china choices: plain and elegant and sturdy with sleek lines. The booths and comfy chairs complement the table placement and the window treatments were simple, modern, unfussy and fresh. Good diverse music at the right level--electronica and singer- songwriter kinda vibe. The menu offered a great variety to choose from especially the balance between sweet and savory and waffle and not-waffle. Glad we Yelped \"Saturday brunch\" and saw all the great reviews!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast we have had in years! I had the Benny Waffle. Delicious egg Benedict with fresh crab. Greatest home fries ever! Made with multi colored mini potatoes and sweet potatoes. Coffee was good. My wife had the Funky Monkey and couldn't stop raving about it. Daughter had what was the best sausage gravy I have ever tasted. May get that myself on a return visit. My 6 year old son thoroughly enjoy his waffles with chocolate sauce. Environment, and atmosphere was thoroughly enjoyable. Great place, great food, we'll be back.

Only downside, like some of the other reviews state, the smells of the kitchen tend to attach themselves to your clothes."}
{"text":"I been here a few times and tried the Megaberry Waffles and the Breakfast Magic both delicious - only downfall which is responsible for the one missing star is the long waiting time even if tables are free ..."}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best breakfast food I have had in awhile. Each plate is decorated neatly along with their multiple different flavors of syrup. Maple bourbon made with real bourbon, vanilla also made with real vanilla and regular maple. Coffee served fresh and in plenty. 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"i was not crazy about waffles inc when it was in new brighton, but i am liking the beaver location!
in all honesty, i don't think there is anything special about the waffles. YES, they have a wide variety off \"add in's\" and recipes, but it is a pricey waffle with \"add in's\" (chocolatae chips, cinnamon, apples, nuts, etc\" at $1 each. you can EASILY end up with a $12 waffle without realizing it. 
however, i am not disappointed by the regular breakfasts. the eggs have been cooked to perfection every time. i don't get bread with my meals but the potatoes are DIVINE!! i could bathe in a tub of them! DREAMY! 
they have purple, white, pink and sweet potatoes. the seasoning they use is wonderful. 
it DOES get smokey in there and , when packed, it is quite loud. other than that, i am liking it. 
best breakfast option IN beaver, fo' sho'!"}
{"text":"Wonderful brunch place.  Call ahead a make a reservation.  Will contact you via txt.  Amazing assortment of waffles.  The omelets were awesome as well.  Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast restaurant in pittsburgh! The food is always delicious and fresh. The service is great, everyday, no matter what. Even when the place is stuffed to the gills, the wait staff goes above and beyond to provide the best service possible. Their rotating menu of specials is always unique and delicious, too!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, but crepes were terrible. Friends got waffles (breakfast magic) that were pretty good but everything was pretty overpriced. Coffee tasted good and it's nice to see a small business being busy, but I'd like to have better quality food that actually comes hot for the price!!"}
{"text":"The waffles are okay. The home fries are phenomenal. Go for the home fries.

The first time I came here I split a waffle and one of the veggie omelets. We chose the waffle you can top yourself. Because not all toppings are created equal, it wasn't great. But I also thought the waffle itself was not light and crispy - the texture is a denser, average waffle that you could make at home. Plus, they don't have real maple syrup and I'm a snob about that. I was, however, blown away by the home fries! The omelet was good.

When I came back this time, I ordered the mushroom and chèvre omelet. The eggs were cooked with the mushroom and then filled with plenty of goat cheese. Delicious. The perfect saltiness of the home fries complemented it well. I have tried other people's waffles but I just don't think they're anything special. They're good and you can be creative with the toppings (or just choose one of their flavors), but to me, the eggs and particularly the home fries are what make this a 4-5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Solid brunch spot for those who adore waffles like I do. They have ample savory and sweet options plus a good location (near South Side Works) with outdoor street-side seating. Definitely tougher to get a seat on Sunday morning but nothing the No Wait App can't fix. All-in-all, a solid brunch spot for a small group but a little skimpy on the portions. 

Food:
I'll start here since this was the star of the show. Two words: Funky Monkey. I've got a killer sweet tooth and this one did the trick to appease it. Milk chocolate chips stuffed in the center with a very rich and not overly-nutty peanut butter chiffon. Big fan of the bourbon syrup too. I would die a happy man if that was my last meal. My only criticism was the portion- $9 isn't outrageous and for someone who eats small portions, I was fine. But it's subpar for Pittsburgh standards. Definitely not your Deluca's. A few others at the table had the savory ones and the chorizo stuffed waffle was a favorite. 

Drinks:
Being in Pittsburgh, when places offer local goods, it makes me happy. Coffee roasted in Beaver Falls- good stuff. 
 
Ambience:
I can't speak much to inside but outdoor seating was a nice find. It's street side so it isn't that glorious but when the weather is nice, it's a rarity to find in Pittsburgh. 

Service:
Our waiter spilled water and coffee twice but he just struck me as a clumsy guy. Otherwise he was very responsive and friendly- no complaints at all there."}
{"text":"Fun and different! I had the mushroom/chevre omelette, and boyfriend had the spicy chorizo egg waffle thing. Everything there is basically a waffle thing, so if you're \"eh\" about em, beware that your other choice is basically omelettes. 
They scored big when I asked for hot sauce and they brought Franks AND sriarcha. 
Atmosphere is just about as perfect as you can get for a south side breakfast joint. Will go back. Will get some sort of \"dessert\" waffle thing."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much when I got this food joint. I have had savory and sweet waffles before but I was pretty impressed with the concept of stuffed waffles. I ordered the Souther' Waffle which was stuffed with chorizo and topped with cheese, pico de gallo, an egg and some sour cream on the side. The portion size is pretty small so the plating looked a bit awkward but taste-wise, delicious and savory. The waffle tasted and felt fresh - not hard like the frozen waffles, but soft and spongy. My friend got the Breakfast Magic with Homestyle Fries on the side. She really enjoyed her meal and coffee. The restaurant is busy - we had an 1.5 hour wait and the food came out pretty slowly. Overall, pretty good food and okay service."}
{"text":"Good food but service is very slow. Need more staff. Cooks shouldn't be serving the food too... has great potential but not with current situation."}
{"text":"Loved it Loved it Loved it,!!! The food is top quality with the freshest ingredients. This is a must visit in Pittsburgh. The Benny has crab meat with ham on a waffle...delicious!!!! The portions are just right. The chicken and waffles...The chicken was very tender and tasty and not a lot bread... Fabulous! The waffles that accompanied the chicken were good, and not too sugary."}
{"text":"Whatever the waitstaff puts in from of you, put it in your mouth. Yes everything is that good. 

Go. Eat. Be Happy. I could write more but why equivocate."}
{"text":"I love Waffles Incaffeinated! The food was absolutely amazing! The menu has a huge selection of crazy waffle creations as well as some basic ones if you're not feeling in a daring mood :p. I love that there is also the option to eat healthy here! You can build your own omelet. We didn't have to wait long to be seated. However, the atmosphere is a little busy and overwhelming! That wouldn't stop me from eating their at all, just a comment! I definitely give it an A+"}
{"text":"A mediocre breakfast, unfortunately.  I ordered the Breakfast Magic which barely incorporated any of the toppings in the waffle, the toppings were cold, and the \"over medium\" egg on top was served rock-hard.   Coffee was good, service was pleasant, but meal execution was sub-par.  Other guests seemed to be enjoying their meals, so I may have just had an unusual experience, but not that inspired to come back."}
{"text":"We ordered a chocolate Waffle and a breakfast Waffle with fried chicken on it. So delicious! The wait time was pretty short as we already reserved our seats through Yelp. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Came in on Sunday morning and the line was out the door. There ability to turn tables was impressive, we were sat within 10 minutes. I had the mega berry waffle with cordial ice cream on top and a side of bacon. My wife had their monte Cristo with side a bacon. She was pleased with her meal, but may not order it again. My waffle was great, it had a lot of flavor and the waffle was able to hold up to the weight and liquid of the berries. My only complaint was that they used frozen berries, but it might be due to the season. We are coming again a week to try their other offerings."}
{"text":"Their waffles are fabulous, however, they sometimes are misleading with their charges--particularly if you're making your own waffle. Be careful, and make sure to ask what the corresponding amount of money your spending to the amount of food put in the waffle if you're on a tight budget. I recommend the Funky Monkey! For their reservations, they use an app, so plan ahead that you're going to Waffles Incaffeinated, because usually there's a long wait."}
{"text":"The menu has so many choices I couldn't decide!  So I told the waitress to bring \"what ever she likes\" - man, was that a great idea..  Had the Southerner - waffle, jalapenos, chorizo and cheese with an egg - man, that will wake your mouth up!"}
{"text":"Great place for weekend brunch !!! The wait list is usually long. Don't forget to call first or use yelp wait list, so that u know the approx time :)"}
{"text":"Gluten free. Dairy Free and amazing.....I was in Pittsburgh over a year ago and went to this restaurant. I came back with my family to help me move in the area. I made sure we went here for breakfast during their visit here. They loved it. No one had leftovers and the portions were a decent size for the cost. This is a Pittsburgh must go!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, its the best. Their line is usually out the door, but I promise its worth it.

Their waffles are so light and fluffy with a slight crisp. Their tri-color breakfast potatoes are the best I've ever had

My go-to's are the breakfast sausage waffle or the breakfast magic. My fiance always gets the amazing open-faced croque monsieur.

Also their coffee is so good.

The servers are friendly and attentive, even when this place is packed. Don't bring a group though, its pretty small."}
{"text":"This was my second time at Waffles INCaffeinated and i was highly disappointed this time considering my first experience here was great. I came with my friend and her husband, and we had asked for a larger end table, since my friend and I are immunosuppressed. While the hostess (brown/red hair and freckles) couldn't have guessed that, the eye rolling and annoyed attitude should not have been present. Once we were seated, it took forever for our waitress to appear to take our drink order, at least 20 minutes. While we were eating, we could see and hear our initial hostess and another waitress badmouthing one of their customers and laughing about it. The food was great, but the waffles have significantly reduced in size, and the lack of service  (my friend's husband never did get his water) made me realize that this place is not worth visiting again. Maybe another location."}
{"text":"Ordered Chicken and Waffles and Funky Monkey. Food was good. Not as good as the Dor-Stop or Pamela's. Atmosphere nice. Service a little slow. Waited for 10 minutes now to get a refill on coffee. Don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE.  We honestly had to walk out on our order because the kitchen time was 35 minutes and up once you placed your food order.  It took our server 15 minutes to even approach us for drinks upon arrival.  She never checked back for refills while we tried to wait for our food.  None of the other customers in the restaurant were pleased with the service.  Many people including us requested to speak to a manager.  Upon speaking to him he simply apologized and made an excuse for the kitchen being backed up.  The manager did not assist the servers nor did he seem to know how to handle managing a restaurant.  The wait staff seemed very frazzled and overwhelmed for such a small restaurant.  Essentially the staff seemed untrained and unable to handle their small section of tables.  We told them we would like to cancel our order and left to go to another breakfast restaurant.  We never had a chance to try the food so I cannot comment on the quality.  However, the menu was very limited if you do not like waffles.  It also was over priced with most breakfast entrees costing $9-$11 and not having large portions from what we could observe from the few tables who were fortunate enough to have received their food after the very long wait.  Overall, we will never go back to this establishment and we would not recommend it to any friends or family in the future."}
{"text":"Yum!! Everything is really good, but pricey for your average college student. It's one of those places that I go to every once in a while. The food can take a little time to come out, but that's with it always being very busy on the days I've been there."}
{"text":"Good little breakfast place in Southside Works. Waffles & Gravy is fantastic. Their take on a biscuit and gravy. My son ordered the grilled cheese and he loved it!"}
{"text":"Very cold Sunday morning visit today, both outside and inside restaurant. We were a party of 4 and arrived early in the day. We waited just a minute or two before being seated. We sat at a 4 top by the hostess stand. Horrible spot on a cold day. There are doors that are locked by the hostess stand, but there was so much cold air pouring in between the locked doors and under the doors. Are four of us were frozen and left our coats on the entire time in the restaurant. 
I have been wanting to try one of the locations for quite some time and finally got my opportunity this morning. My wife liked her breakfast combo that she had. My son and I each had the chicken and waffles. We both liked the chicken a lot but the waffles not so much.  My son only would eat one bite of his. My daughter ordered the kids waffles with strawberries and Nutella. She enjoyed her sausage patty but absolutely hated her waffle. She ended up just eating her strawberries and Nutella. Then we were charged with a drink that we never ordered. I only noticed it after paying the bill. When I noticed we had paid and there was a big line of people eyeing our table. It wasn't worth the time to ask for my $2 back.  I'm sad it wasn't all that I had hoped it would be."}
{"text":"While I actually had a sandwich and not a waffle, I still loved it. I can't wait to come back for breakfast, lunch, or brunch! Definitely recommend for a fun date and or family fun!"}
{"text":"The food is great. Everything else? Not so much.

I will say that I've really enjoyed the food both times I've been here. The first time, I was with a group of 4 and it took 45 minutes for our meal to come. I gave them the benefit of the doubt because- hey- it's a busy weekend morning and there were 4 of us. And the food was awesome, so I wanted to go back.

Went back today with one friend. We ordered two omelets and their special waffle to share. We had been waiting 30 minutes to get a seat (highly recommend the NoWait app to get in line before you arrive), so we ordered almost immediately after sitting down because we had time to look at the menu. 45 minutes after we got our table, we started feeling hangry as we watched the tables around us (who had been seated after us) get their food. We asked our server for a status update, and she said that omelets just take longer than waffles and they should be out soon.

We hit the one hour mark, and we watched omelets get served to a couple across the restaurant who had arrived after us.

Don't get me wrong- our server was nice and great through the whole shitty process. You just reach a point where you are so hungry that you can't really enjoy your food. They took about half off our bill, and that was nice. But they forgot to return my friend's card (which we of course didn't realize until we drove back across town). 

Ultimately, the great food doesn't make up for subpar service I've had both times I've been here. Would recommend you find somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"Very good food. But sort of pricey. First time here and had delightful service. The gentleman that waited our table was very nice and quick. Lovely experience!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here with some girlfriends last weekend! The place was packed and I was told the wait would be about 45 minutes, but thankfully was only about 20 minutes until our table was ready! We had waffles and crepes which were all pretty good! Service was decent but very slow, it took about 45 minutes after ordering to finally get our food. We all enjoyed and planned to meet here again in the future."}
{"text":"The food here is just decent.  I got the \"Benny\", which is eggs benedict on a waffle.  The waffle was a bit softer than I like but the toppings were ok.  I ordered homes fries and bacon on the side, those were actually the best part of the meal for me.  On the plus side, service was very good and they accommodated our every need."}
{"text":"I suppose I'll deliver the good news first, the food at this establishment was delicious and I would recommend the food to anyone. However, this was honestly the worst dining experience I've ever had, I don't even know where to begin. 

For starters, we weren't greeted at our table. Instead the waitress slung water at us in a hurry and ran off. I get it. Both my dining partner and I are part of the service industry and can understand what its like to be busy, however in any establishment you expect  at least a hello or welcome. Fine, we decide to choose our breakfast quickly so we can give our busy waitress the order. She comes back to our table 10 minutes later and we tell her we're ready to order, to which she responds she'll come back when SHE is ready because she has other tables to tend to. K den. We wait as she takes two other tables' orders and puts them into the computer, another 10/15 minutes. Finally we order an omelet and a waffle to share, wahoo, we were super hungry. 

20 minutes...30 minutes... 45 minutes... People who sat 10-15 minutes after us are getting their food and we're waiting. The waitress was nowhere in site, tables around us sat dirty while people lined up at the host stand. (This didn't directly affect us but again, as people in the industry we take notice of such. No wonder it takes them so long to seat their wait list). Finally after waiting for 45 minutes for our food, our waitress returned to the table and said \"Wait, what did you guys order? Cause the printer jammed and we lost the ticket.\"  Such a sad story, apparently said printer only \"jammed\" for our order as everyone around us enjoyed their meals. At this point, we were ready to leave but instead repeated our order. No apology from our server, a manager, anybody. This experience could've been handled SO much more professionally. Blaming the kitchen and the \"printer\" for crappy, slow service is just completely unprofessional. Another 20 minutes go by and we get our food, but have no silverware to enjoy it with (also something we noticed at every table around us, everyone had to flag down their server to ask for cutlery, this is a restaurant!!). The food was good, but at this point we would've eaten anything after waiting close to 90 minutes from host stand to meal.

What really frustrated both of us wasn't the experience in total but that nobody offered us an apology, an opportunity to speak to a manager, nothing. This was a one-hit failure for both of us and we will never go back. 10/10 would never recommend unless you eat a full size Thanksgiving meal to hold you over for 90 minutes while the service staff runs around \"jamming printers.\""}
{"text":"Food was amazing. We came on a Saturday morning. We were seated right away but we waited over 30 minutes for our food. It was definitely busy but also worth the wait. The portion sizes vary by menu item. The chicken and waffles were the special and they were delicious! Coffee was good. Prices were good too. A must try place!"}
{"text":"Was super excited to get some good breakfast! Unfortunately we had to wait for about 45 minutes to get a table and then about another 50 minutes until our food was served. Be prepared to wait for a while on a weekend morning. Other than the long wait, the food was fantastic"}
{"text":"We finally had the opportunity to try this place out this past Sunday morning.  I checked the website for opening time and it said 8 AM.  We got there at 7:55 AM the parking lot was empty and there were no lights on inside at all.  The time on the door said 8 AM so we waited but there was no sign of life.  We were so disappointed and mad because we had just gotten off of the night shift and were so hungry!  Won't go back there again since it is clear they do not know how to run a business."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my family for my mom's birthday. The space is small and intimate, but they make the most of their space. They have a lot of tables and they even have a coffee bar in the front of their store. One nice perk is that you can get on the waitlist online, so I got on the waitlist from my house and then drove over around the time our table is ready. *they will text you when you're table is ready, but can only hold it for 10 minutes after they text you!* The menu is small, but you can get jazzy by creating your own waffle combination. I got the Benny, which is basically eggs Benedict on a waffle. I was skeptical of this, but it really worked! They also make a hollandaise in house and it was delicious! They topped the Benny with crab meat and it was much appreciated! I was checking out peoples food around me and everything looked really good. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Another one for the \"one and done\" list. The only consolation here was that their waffles were above average. 

Food was pretty pricy for 1 measly waffle, and portions were barely filling.  

Additionally, the staff were grumpy, food was slow and their piss poor ventilation will leave you smelling like the place. (A grease oven) 

They seriously need to work on their ventilation, because I doubt anyone likes smelling greasy after a meal."}
{"text":"I stopped in Pittsburgh and knew I had to certainly try some great breakfast place. Saw yelp and thought this place is certainly a great place. Got there around 11 and was told it was about a 30-40 minute wait. I wasn't in a rush and decided to wait it out. Went for a walk around the area and returned. Unfortunately there was a lot of people and the wait ended up being almost an hour. Everything one the menu looked amazing! My server recommend me the Foster's Waffle. When it came it was pretty big and best of all it came with ice cream! The waffle also came with walnuts, bananas and this chocolate sauce. I thought the food was great however I'm not sure if I would be willing to wait an hour for this place. Please come early for this place to avoid the wait. 

Pros:
Good Food
Great Service

Cons:
Long wait, arrive early if possible"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious breakfast. Ingredients are fresh, dishes are creative. This place brought me back to breakfast. My 6 year old loves it too. From the Eggs to the bacon to the waffles and chicken! We will be back. It'll be hard for me to go anywhere else for breakfast."}
{"text":"we got the Benny and thr Stra-ana. loved the idea but didn't meet our expectation. Food was okay... nothing really special"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  My boyfriend and I split a Breakfast Magic and the Funky Monkey.  Waffles were awesome.  I really enjoyed the tri-colord side of potatoes they have.  It was also a plus that it was Monday and the breakfast magic was only $4! Their home made bourbon syrup was also delicious.  Would def recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"I'm a huge waffle fanatic. Basically my favorite breakfast entree. The Megaberry waffle is one of the top favorites here and it's never failed me. Their savory waffles are amazing as well. They have nice service every time I've gone. On the weekends it can be pretty busy so there might be lines to wait in so plans should be made accordingly."}
{"text":"This is the first yelp review I've ever written. But I thought it was necessary. This place is super basic re: bad. It's all generic frozen food, cheap eggs, and essentially hotel waffle batter. It's not like it's the worst thing in the world, but it's definitely spectacularly unspecial. The tri color potatoes are good sure, but you could buy a frozen bag of em that's higher quality at Trader Joe's. Same with the \"fried chicken\" - They're frozen chicken fingers *eye roll*.  For similar cuisine, check out the complimentary breakfast buffet at your local Ramada Inn. It also took 52 minutes to get our food."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem on the South Side of Pittsburgh!
Met a friend there Saturday for breakfast ... got there early before the crowd so no problem with getting a seat. Service was a little laid back, but good. My friend loved the Funky Monkey and my mushroom chevre omelet was really, really, really good!
Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and they even had a vegan waffle option which is rare. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I really love the sausage and gravy waffles, which are very special and fits Asian's taste. The taste is amazing delicious and I recommend choosing double size without double price. The waffles with ice cream are also popular. What I enjoy most is softy and a little crispy waffles. Also, the latte/cappuccino can be refilled once, which surprises us a lot.

I suggest that you should arrive Waffles INCaffeinated early when weekend because the line is always long. Another choice is to go there on the weekdays, which save you a lot of time. I pretty enjoy Waffles INCaffeinated and definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Service was great, breakfast selection is amazing. Had such a hard time trying to figure out what to order. Ended up with a berry waffle and it was great! It was a lot though and I should have just split one waffle with my sister in law who ordered the same thing. Either way, it tasted amazing. Oh, and the coffee gets a thumbs up as well. 

It's kind of a small place, so use their reservation app. I'm from Cleveland, but the app seems to be used in most Pittsburgh restaurants so it's worth a download if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Must try for any waffle/ breakfast lover!! I went early on a Sunday morning with two friends and we were seated immediately. Our waiter was very quick. I got the Megaberry Waffle- Blueberries cooked into the waffle; topped with strawberries, raspberries, whipped cream, and a raspberry drizzle. It was SO great!"}
{"text":"Came to pittsburgh to visit friends and had breakfast here before leaving this blue collar town.  These waffles have a good variety of sweet, savory, and classic waffles.  They also serve up some tasty coffee and lattes.  In addition, they have Bourbon maple syrup for your savory waffles.

Next time I come here, I'll get the most interesting thing on the menu...a waffle gyro.  Instead of a pita they wrap the contents in a waffle...sounds like a great brunch item."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more, but it was solidly average.  The menu was good with decent variety of savory and sweet waffle choices among other breakfast items.  They had gluten free waffles, which was nice due to a family member having a gluten sensitivity, and I had the chicken and waffles.  Like other reviews stated, it was decent, but for $40 for 2 adults and 2 kids (who split a breakfast), I wanted to be wow'd.  

I always want to start with the good, but I think I already mentioned all the good.  Good menu with decent food.  They did have some decent syrup choices outside maple.  We tried the vanilla and bourbon syrup.  This isn't vanilla flavored maple syrup, it is vanilla syrup that pours clear.  The bourbon on the chicken and waffles was very good.

Now on to what could make it better, with some of problems not being able to be changed.  I think the biggest problem was the noise.  It is a no frills décor restaurant with two walkways with tables on both sides, but the room just echoed terribly.  I could barely hear anything my family was saying across the table.

Our server was ok, but it was just slow.  We did go on a packed Saturday, so it is understandable, but I need a bigger coffee cup than the Dixie cup sized cup of coffee they gave me which was gone is 0.2 seconds.  It would be nice if they had runners in addition to the servers.  For a breakfast place, your coffee cup should never be empty.  In addition, our food was not very hot due to the fact that I stared at it sitting in the window for several minutes.  It really wasn't our waitresses fault since she was taking orders at the time.  (of course, it was the people who had a million questions, seriously people, it is a waffle place with good descriptions on the menu).  By the time she took their order than got our food, it was not that hot.  It would have been nice to have someone running food out and filling coffee cups.

Like I said, it was good and different for the north hills.  We will probably try it again, but not go out of our way"}
{"text":"So many people on weekend morning. You'd better go around 8am. There many menu in addition to waffles."}
{"text":"Perfect for brunch or breakfast. Waffle joint that has a long list of toppings and mix-ins to create your own or menu favorites among the house. We ordered the benny, southern waffle, and the magic waffle. The benny was a spin off of eggs Benedict but instead of the toast, it was served on a waffle and topped with a lump pile of crab meat. My roommates ordered the other two and they both enjoyed their food. I would recommend sitting outside because the inside is not very updated and is crowded. Overall, we enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"Waffles INCaffeinated is a delightful little spot perfect for a late breakfast on a Saturday. I don't understand for the life of me why people would be willing to wait over 30 minutes for a waffle...that's why I waited a few months after opening before I decided to give this place a try. 

My wife and I arrived around 9:30am and didn't have much of a wait, although it seemed to fill up quick after we got there. The ambiance is simple. Nothing really makes it stand out...just seems to feel like your everyday breakfast spot...not super inviting. The menu is a bit intimidating with all of the options. I decided to go with the Waffle of the month. It was a mocha waffle with white chocolate chips, strawberries and espresso infused whipped cream. I also had a side of their home fries. What I loved about this waffle was the flavor...it's all about the flavors working together people! I never get too enthused with places like this because the breakfasts seem so decadent and I'm afraid the meal will be a \"punch-you-in-the-mouth\" sweetness that will inevitably be cavity inducing. However, I was so impressed with the flavors in my meal rather than the sweetness. I really enjoyed it. The potatoes were nice too. 

Coffee was good - check
service was good - check
food was good - check

All in all, this place is a winner. The only thing I didn't like was that it was a little loud and my jacket smelled greasy for a couple days after my visit."}
{"text":"Called ahead for table of six. All young, black people. The server greets us by saying, \"I'll get you guys some waters to start off and by the way we don't have fried chicken.\" 
All of us at the table looked at each other, due to he fact that no one even began to order anything. 
When the last person in the party joined, also a young black person, the server repeated herself, \"I'll get you a water, and also, we don't have any fried chicken.\"
Despite the fact that we called ahead (around 12pm) we were served last, along with another group of young black people that we had seen outside while being seated. About 3:05 pm. we looked around and noted an older black couple leaving out. Only the black people were left. Is this all coincidental? That's for you to decide, reader. It was pretty clear to me, and I will not be spending my money here again."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time this morning, and even though it is Father's Day my husband and I were seated immediately. He got the breakfast tacos after seeing them on the table next to us, and he loved them. I got the breakfast magic and asked to have avocado added on top. Oh my, it was fantastic. Unfortunately, it was huge and I had no chance of finishing it successfully. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The bomb.com. Their coffee is great. I like my coffee sweet and their regular black roast is a good and sweet brew. The home fries are like NO OTHER. I'm talking gourmet breakfast potatoes. They use regular potatoes, sweet potatoes, baby reds, basically every potatoes and the potatoes are cooked in delicious seasonings with sour cream cooked into them. OMG so good I can't even. The megaberry waffle is to die for. I took a bite and I said \"Omg I think I just died.\" And they have this ridiculously amazing homemade VANILLA BEAN SYRUP. WHAT??? YES. So good. 

I use the No Wait app whenever I plan on going to sit down and eat because you get seated quickly and don't have to wait. 

I order out quite often though and one time the waffle boy chased me to my car to give me the side of vanilla bean syrup they forgot to put in the bag. So nice!!! Love it. Go there."}
{"text":"This place is worth going to if you have nothing else to do for 3 hours on a Saturday.  After waiting 2 hours to get seated we ordered our food with pretty high expectations. Overall the waffles were good, but frankly I can make waffles at home that are about the same quality with no wait time. By the time we left the restaurant we had spent 3 hours inside and lost a good portion of our Saturday."}
{"text":"I came here for gluten free waffles and was rewarded for my efforts perhaps not beyond the dreams of humans but at least not beyond the dreams of my admittedly fairly limited online search.  

There are gluten-free waffles.  They are huge, perfect, Belgian-style deliciousness.  There is a long list of add-ins that you can put in the batter, and another but mostly overlapping list of toppings, both including savory items as well as sweet.  You can build your own or go with one of the house specials, but either way you're going to get delicious waffle-y goodness, cooked to perfection and served hot.

As the name may suggest, there's also a decent selection of caffeinated beverages.  I know zero about coffee, but the tea selection is good - a number of black teas and one green, all from Two Leaves and a Bud, which is solid quality for a bagged tea.  

The space is nice and mellow, service is good, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We got there around 930 on saturday morning. It was packed already. After 20 mins of wait we were seated. Seevice was quite good for how crowded it was. Had pecan waffles with chicken. It was good proportion and tasty. Def would be coming back again."}
{"text":"My eggs Benedict was cold. Manager came by and replaced my meal and did not charge me. Second time around was great!"}
{"text":"Sweet Jesus. This place, at least on the weekend, is more of a daycare than a breakfast joint. Babies screeching, incredibly loud music, crashing in the kitchen, and you've got yourself an impressive aural assault, baby! 

The waiting area is about the size of my coffee table, so you have to awkwardly jam yourself into a corner while waiting for a table (despite putting yourself on the waitlist prior to arrival). There is zero ambiance and the tables are packed together so tightly, nearby toddlers can furtively wipe their boogers on you. The horror.

Two stars instead of one because they have a decent tea selection, our server was very nice, and the food wasn't bad. It definitely wasn't great either though. Should have gone to the Chipotle down the road instead."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Nothing at all I can say besides the freshens of the waffle was lucious! They have a vanilla syrup that is home-made that is good. My knock on this place was we had a horrible server. She didn't say anything to us or ask us anything at all for an hour! We had people beside us that ate a whole meal before we got served! We arrived the same time! That's bs. How you going to pass us up 6-7 times and not ask if we need a refill? No eye contact nothing! Just SAT looking dumb with 2 glasses of empty oj for 40 minutes. Not sure I'll come back but for a one time thing it was tasty."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this morning for a quick breakfast.  When I left the DT area at around 9:15, there was no wait!  However, by the time I found it and parked, there was a 45 minute wait for parties of 2 or more, on this Saturday.  But yay, I was a single!!  Seated at a tiny table in the back which was fine - restaurant was small and busy.  My waitress, while not cheery or talkative (again, fine) - was responsive and prompt.  She realized I was trying to get in an out and made sure not to ignore the sad little one-top.  

So I wanted to try this place, but admitedly I'm not a major waffle fan.  These waffles though, they're an A+.  They're not just plain waffle, but have flavor.  I ended up getting the Benny and the hollandaise was technically correct (no separation, tasted good) and the crab meat was cleaned well.  My food did come out a little cold, but that may have just been the general temp of the restaurant and the fact that there weren't really any cooked items besides the waffle (poached eggs loose heat quickly).  

Breakfast for one under $10, before tip.  Definitely use the NoWait app as the waiting area is extremely small.

Overall, give it a shot - they've got some great menu items!"}
{"text":"Although the food took a while to come up, I can say that it was amazing. Their vanilla bean syrup is so good it makes your meal melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"Used be five stars for me until today. Yes the experience was enough to drop to one star. Restaurant was half full but none of the empty tables were wiped down.

 A family had a baby sitting in an upside down and clearly broken baby chair covered in gum and other dirt. 

Waitress was abominable, manager who brought our food out looked like a methed out Albert Einstein with hair so long it nearly reached our plates. The place itself is showing major signs of neglect. Cook screams ORDER UP because the waitresses are horrible, food still cold. Poached eggs over done. Hot sauce in the hollandaise I'm assuming to mask the flavor (was never like that before). 

Waited for five minutes after paying for the togo I placed with my entrees, then left cause honestly it sucked anyways."}
{"text":"The eggs Benedict was good. A little expensive. $14 for that and coffee is a little overpriced. The place needs better ventilation. I came out of there smelling like I've been in a grease pit!"}
{"text":"Good food, creative entrees and will alter the orders to fit your tastes, decent service, a little pricey."}
{"text":"The wait for a table was long but the greeter did tell us about the nowait app which is very helpful. He was the best thing about the place. Once we got seated, we order rather quickly but it was forever until we got our food. The server never came to check on us or explain the wait. Although he did fill my  cup of coffee 3 times. When we did get our food it was as of it was sitting by an open window...cold, not luke warm, cold. The server never even asked how everything was for us. $30 for two could have been spent nearby at Nadines or the new bakery with breakfast and hardly no wait across and just down the street. Got that our of our systems, no need to do that again."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with my parents on a Sunday when they were visiting. The vibe of the restaurant is the only thing keeping it from 5 stars. It is kind of squished (as it was very busy due to a Steelers game) and very loud. The tables are extremely close to one another. BUT! We used this opportunity to get to know the couple next to us. 

They have a HUGE selection of waffles and other breakfast items on the menu. The Funky Monkey and Chicken and Waffles were both delicious and filling! The other portions (specifically the Benny which my mom ordered), however, are a little on the small side. Would probably go back."}
{"text":"FINALLY got a table! My husband and I were smart and left early on a Saturday morning- we were able to get the last open table. The crowded tables are certainly a testament to how good the food is. The main reason I wanted to go was for the gluten free waffles- which didn't disappoint! The menu has many pre-made waffle options, as well as build-you-own options. I got the gluten free waffle, with nutella, foster sauce, bananas, and walnuts on top. I was very happy! The portion size was big enough to take it home and enjoy it for lunch later. My husband was able to mix two of the pre-made waffles together for a spicy dish. Prices were fair for the portion size, but the drink options were all a little hefty for how small they were. I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a go-to if you want a good waffle. All of the waffles are delicious. They also have omelettes and some other breakfast items, as well as a lunch menu. I had and omelette once too, and it was okay, but wasn't anything to rave about like the waffles.One thing that is cool is that they have a bunch of different syrups. They have your normal maple syrup, but they also have a whiskey syrup which isn't as sweet, as well as some other options. 

Just a warning, if you go on a weekend, be prepared to wait 30 minutes to an hour.They offer to call you when your table is ready, so if you really wanted to you could go walk around Southside Works as long as you don't venture too far away.

For as nice as a place it is I didn't expect such as \"get them in get them out attitude\". I know they get busy, but since it's a little higher end than a diner I kind of expected a little more attentiveness from the staff...but it's okay, because the waffles are so good!"}
{"text":"I had Waffles, they were good. Had to remind a friend, \"No, don't order pancakes at place called 'Waffles Incaffeinated'\""}
{"text":"I literally love this place. The concept, ambiance, and food are all executed so well. This location blows the socks off the New Brighton locaion where we had several customer service issues in the past. There's much more room here as well. Everything was on point. I have no complaints. 

I recommend the Funky Monkey if you're into a sweet waffle like I am. 

I only wish they would come to Cranberry. They'd kill it here."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant 2.5-3 stars. To save time I downloaded the no wait app and put in my reservation while I was still home. When I got here I was seated and skipped the line. Yes the food was very good. I had the blueberry waffles with a side of fried chicken (don't judge me).  HOWEVER, if you are extremely hungry I do not recommend you come here. I WAITED 50 MINS FOR MY FOOD."}
{"text":"I met a friend at Waffles INCaffeinated for a mid-morning breakfast on a Monday. It is located in a small strip in Wexford and is deceivingly larger inside compared to how it looks from the exterior. When I arrived, there was plenty of parking and the dining area was not very full. My friend and I were promptly seated and offered beverages. Our waitress was friendly and was patient with us as we took our time deciding on what to order. The menu is composed of a variety of unique waffle combinations (DUH), omelettes, breakfast sandwiches, crepes, french toast, and a small selection of side dishes. After a long debate, I settled on the Funky Monkey, waffles topped with bananas, chocolate chips, powdered sugar, and a mini Hershey bar. It was like dessert for breakfast with a banana thrown in the mix! My friend ordered the Breakfast Magic which was an egg breakfast on top of a waffle! How creative!  The waffles were huge and thank goodness we had a lot to catch up on or they would have required us to stay longer than we anticipated just to finish our meals. 

Though the food was good and the portions fairly large, the prices were slightly high. I ordered a cup of tea and that alone was $2. When returning, I will probably stick with ordering waffles since that is what they are in business for and I can get the other menu items somewhere else for a better price. Overall, this was a nice place with a unique twist on breakfast waffles that is worth a try!"}
{"text":"GREAT cup of coffee and the waffles are unbeatable!!

I couldn't make my mind up as to whether to have sweet or savoury so I had one of each!! Ice cream is acceptable for breakfast when it is on a candies pecan waffle with bananas and caramel!!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service, kept the coffee coming!! I can't wait to try the many other options that are available. I don't know what brand of coffee they serve but I seriously love it."}
{"text":"Not totally thrilled here.

Mocha = good

Berry waffle = good

Potatoes = good

Crab Benedict = ick - I had heard how great this was, but I was definitely disappointed.  Mine came out partially cold.  The crab meat was not fresh.  The whole combination was weird.  The egg wasn't right... aren't they supposed to be poached?  I was not pleased.

Service = slow

Definitely not my favorite breakfast spot in Pittsburgh.  Also, the waffles seriously pale in comparison to Waffallonia."}
{"text":"Ugh. Ok, so I give up on this place. I've tried it several times. The service is always snarky, unfriendly, and rude. Not to mention that it takes 1+ hours to make a waffle at 1pm on a Tuesday??? The food is good, but the place is cramped. It just isn't worth the hassle. Also, good luck using a groupon there...They tack on about 50 rules that aren't mentioned on the actual groupon and it took me 4 tries to get them to actually take it. And then the waiter says \"Oh, you are one of them...\" Whatever, I didn't sell the groupons that you obviously hate."}
{"text":"In the Southside, breakfast options tend to be limited. I really went to W.I. because I love the coffee they get from Beaver Falls Tea and Coffee. The waffles were neat with many toppings, but they weren't the best I've had. The breakfast wasn't bad at all, it just didn't exceed my expectations for the area and the pricing."}
{"text":"The waffles were great....they were light and flavorful.  Wait staff was cheerful and actually looked like they enjoyed being there....saturday noon the place was full"}
{"text":"This place is waffle heaven!! I never knew there were so many different recipes and options for waffles, until I came here. I got the Megaberry waffle and it was the biggest and most delicious waffle I've ever had. Stuffed with blueberries and raspberries, topped with more berries, whipped creme, and vanilla bean syrup (which I chose from an arrangement of options offered to me), the mixed flavors were incredible!"}
{"text":"A great breakfast spot! Big portions and lots of varieties. If you aren't into waffles, they have other options like omelettes, crepes and eggs Benedict! This time I got the eggs Benedict topped with crabmeat. The home fries are delicious with a mix of different potatoes! Service could be a bit more attentive but they are busy. Our waiter  walked by our table with the coffee pot in his hand three times before he offered to refill ours. I suggest checking in on the no wait app as there is always a 20-40 min wait on the weekends."}
{"text":"Just eh. 

Our experience: cold waffles, not-so-hot coffee, watery \"maple syrup\" and mediocre greasy breakfast foods. I had been excited to check this place out, but was pretty disappointed. 

First, the waffle was so cold that butter didn't melt on it. Wow. The syrup, which would've been nicer warm, was so watery it soaked in within a second. I'd never seen such a thing, in fact. Not even from the cheapest of roadside diners. 

Aside from all of this, the menu options seem pretty vast: both savory and sweet. I like that they offer many things, but finding a plain option (with eggs and a sweet treat) isn't easy without buying sides and making it more complicated than it should be. 

\"I wish the food was as hot as the drama going on in the kitchen,\" said my partner.

It was pretty crazy hearing all of that go on (some girl complaining about her mom and police record?) Honestly, though, I'm not too disturbed by profanity or angry venting, but I wonder what others would think? The waitress was super nice and attentive, though.

We did stop there when it was slower, so I'm not sure how that factors in overall, but I definitely don't see us coming back. A shame."}
{"text":"I just moved to the south side flats and walked around looking for the perfect breakfast spot. I spotted a sign outside WI about  their Monday breakfast magic special. I got this as a take out. The portion size is definitely large and the food was tasty but the waffles was actually not that delicious. Will probably try a dessert item rather than a savory item next time."}
{"text":"When we saw WI was coming to Wexford we were excited for it to open and try it. Unfortunately, it did not meet our expectations.

I echo what many others said in the previous reviews: sign is too small (easy to miss), smells gross when you first walk in, slow service, food takes way too long. 

However, I disagree on one primary thing. My husband and I were not impressed with the food. It's fair at best. I hate bad service (especially when you have to beg for drinks like we did), but there is no reason to go back when the food is average. 

I ordered the Southern Breakfast (waffle stuffed (or should I say contains a tiny bit of) with chorizo (Mexican sausage, which I normally love, but it didn't taste like chorizo at all so just call it sausage) and an egg. It was just ok because it only had a little bit of chorizo and the waffle just was ok.

My husband had the chicken and waffles. Everyone raved about it (and he normally loves it), but did not agree. He thought the chicken was bland (and he likes plain food) and the waffle was just ok.

The only good thing about this experience was the home fries. They were very good (a little too salty), but not enough to bring us back.

We were happy to have another breakfast spot in Wexford. Too bad this place falls way short. Hope they get their act together."}
{"text":"This place has great food! They have so many options which  I love and we got a whole bottle of syrup so we never ran out which I loved and they have the best waffles here they are so good! The service was really good and you can also customize your own omelette."}
{"text":"The food is great, but we had to wait an hour to get in and then our waitress was complaining about her shift to us and she was also incredibly slow. I would go again during a time when they arent as busy--maybe like off hours. Its definitely a place that you must go once before leaving pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Food might end up being good but they are not equiped to make poached eggs that are on the menu, the reasoning they never ran the water????  I asked if they wanted me to show them how to make em all you need is boiling water keep in mind its 10am hours after it opened, major fail"}
{"text":"Waffles INCaffeinated = Waffles INHeaven-ated. At last, someone got creative and took waffles to the next level. Everything on the menu looks enticing, whether it's sweet or savory. With a little imagination, go freestyle and make your own waffles to your personal and unique taste. 

I was sold when I saw the \"Benny\" - Classic Eggs Benedict with your own waffle twist... two perfectly poached eggs nestled on top of a half waffle with ham, fresh Hollandaise sauce and crab meat.

Overall experience was superb! Served with deliciously fresh ingredients, attentive service and friendly prices."}
{"text":"What to get: Megaberry Waffle
Service: 4/5
Atmosphere: breakfast/brunch, cafe
Wait: 0 mins (Tuesday 9AM for 1)
Parking: street

The Experience: [August 2016]
Wow, I'm so impressed by this waffles place that I happened to stumble upon while in town. Maybe it's because it was a weekday, but parking was really easy to secure on the main street.  I'd like zero hassle parking when visiting any city, so this was a nice experience.

The place is a brunch/breakfast spot where you have coffee with friends. I'd bring a few friends here in the morning if I were a local (not a huge party though). It's a quick and friendly place to eat.

I ordered the Megaberry Waffle: raspberries and blueberries inside the waffle, topped with fresh berries, vanilla bean syrup, and whipped cream. It makes for a killer picture. Also their syrups are worth noting. There are ingredients infused in these house-made syrups, so be sure to try them out. The vanilla bean syrup had actual vanilla beans in the bottle. Again, I'm impressed.

Another pat on the back for myself in choosing this place while traveling. Another good find on my long list of food spots."}
{"text":"Been trying to get in here for my last few trips but the wait was always too long. Today we finally got lucky and got in with no wait thanks to putting our name in ahead of arriving.

Once inside it was smaller than I expected, though with the tight waiting area I guess I should have expected it. The seating arrangements were just too close unless you like being on top of the people to the table to the side of you.

As for the food I got the funky monkey waffle and while it was definitely good, it wasn't something special. They had a few other items I wanted to try but maybe another time. I'd come back, but I wouldn't say it's a place I would make an extra effort to get to next time. 

I'd give it a 3.5 if that was possible, but since it isn't I'll go with the four stars because the food was good."}
{"text":"We visited Waffles INCaffeinated with some family from out of town, and boy was it a good choice. 

There was a short wait to be seated, but we needed that time to examine the menu. Everything looked fantastic. I tend be a particular about what I eat, so it is a rarity to find a menu where everything appeals to me. From the sweet to the savory, they had a wide variety of waffles available. 

We settled on two savory waffles and one sweet. ( Breakfast Magic and  Souther' for savory, Peachy Keen for sweet ). There was a small issue with the Souther' waffle, as the egg on top was a little undercooked, but this was quickly remedied by the staff. 

I must say that after having tried three of their waffles, I can't wait to try the rest. The Souther' waffle had a great spicy note to it, the Breakfast Magic didn't skimp on the bacon, and the Peachy Keen was a delicious sweet treat, made even better by their vanilla syrup. 

We also sampled the side order of sweet potato waffle fries, with a marshmallow fluff jerk dipping sauce. The sauce definitely made the fries worth it, giving a nice balance to the flavor of the sweet potato. 

All in all, a very satisfying Waffle offering in Pittsburgh. The only complaint I could muster up is that their hours are inconvenient. Their selection of waffles would be a fantastic late-night bite, alas they close at 3pm on weekdays, 2pm weekend."}
{"text":"We didn't have to wait for a table, but it took about 45 minutes to get food. My friend had to send hers back because the diced veggies on her waffle were frozen and covered in ice. The waitress said it takes about 2 and a half minutes to make a new waffle so I'm not sure why it took so long to get our food in the first place...especially when neither of ours had meat/anything that would take long to cook. It's a decent spot, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"I had the Megaberry... incredible!  Waffle was light and fluffy, berries delicious topped with whipped topping. Busy but service was friendly and attentive. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food is super tasty! I made my own waffle + it was cooked to perfection! I also really liked the coffee. The wait staff was friendly and even let us stay past closing to finish our coffee + order dessert without making us feel rushed or rude. Definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Went back for a third time... Service is SO slow.  The food is good but it is so annoying to wait FOREVER for water and anything else you may need. I ordered a waffle and the waitress did not being me syrup. I asked twice before she remembered to bring it. And again, she refilled my water once and we were there for over an hour. Not cool, not cool at all. It is always like this."}
{"text":"This was a fun experience, but maybe not worth the hour and a half wait.  At least they use No Wait, which makes the wait less painful.  My food was good, but nothing spectacular.  I got the Chicken and Waffles.  The description says \"pecan infused.\"  It's a plain waffle with a handful of pecan halves thrown in.  It was not what I expected.  The chicken is frozen chicken tenders.  The menu says it has some type of maple butter glaze, but it really doesn't. There might have been a little bit on the chicken.  Maybe.  The dish is topped off with a handful of chopped green onions, which is odd. The savior was the vanilla bean syrup, which was great on the chicken, and the maple syrup which was great on the waffle.  Ask for both.  I was not a fan of the bourbon syrup, it tasted of straight alcohol.  The meal was good, I was just expecting a little more.  The boyfriend got the Carnivore Omelette and home fries.  He enjoyed both."}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of Waffles Incaffienated for the last few years. I understand they do not take reservations and that they use the \"no wait\" app, which is usually great. I got to the restaurant when the app told me 10-15 minutes and there were 3 people ahead of me in line. When I checked in with the guy at the front table he told me it would be 10 minutes. I watched him seat 6 other tables and waited 45 minutes before I was seated. Once we were seated, our waitress was kind and attentive but the food took way too long to come out - About another 45 minutes for 2 waffles and 1 omelette. The food is usually great but for the second time, my poached egg was way over cooked. 
    The last few times I have been, the service has been slow, the food has taken a while, and the coffee was cold. I've given this place many chances but sadly, I'm thinking its time to give up."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place when a special guest was coming to town for his first visit. We had a large group, 9, and I figured there would be a wait which we were willing to deal with, but we were turned away entirely! I was told they don't seat parties bigger than 4 after 9 am!!! Why is that important bit of information on your webpage? Or Facebook page? Along with that we were told by them that they used the no wait app. When checked it said wait time was 15-20 minutes. When I went in average wait for under 4 was 45-90 minutes! Thanks for sending us to a different restaurant where we had a better meal and service, I'm sure! They were wonderful and got a 5 star from us!"}
{"text":"Such a great brunch location! If you love waffles, this is the place for you!! 

I went on a weekday around noon and was seated instantly. Ordered a vanilla latte! It was really good! If you want additional syrup/flavoring just let the wait staff know and they will bring out the syrup and let you flavor it yourself. 

The menu is so vast! There's everything from sweet waffles to savory. I ordered a savory waffle--the breakfast magic! It had bacon and cheese cooked into the waffle and it was topped with an egg cooked the way I wanted it--overhard of course (I abhor runny eggs). You can get the waffle with sour cream and they recommend the bourbon syrup! Get all of that. It's really good. 

I chose to get a side as well, the home fries! They were so fresh and consisted of white potatoes, sweet potatoes...all kinds of potatoes!!  They scrumptious. 

Service was good and the place was clean. I would go again!"}
{"text":"absolutely delicious place for breakfast/brunch. the food is amazing with great service. it's basic foods done with a special flair. definitely worth a try if you're visiting the south side."}
{"text":"OHHHH MYYYY GOOODDDNESSS is this a lovely spot for brunch.  I went with a friend to catch up over coffee and waffles (isn't that kind of the point of the restaurant?) and was pleasantly surprised at the variety on their menu.  The facility was very clean, but on the smaller side.  It can also get very crowded on the weekends, but it is definitely worth the wait.  

I also had the southwest waffle because I was not in the mood for something sweet.  It was delightful and made my taste buds scream for joy! The coffee is also excellent but it is very strong so beware!!!"}
{"text":"On a Monday morning at 9:30, one would expect that the service would be fast and friendly; However, this is not what my experience was. The waitress was extremely slow and ignored my table a few times. It was very busy, but the waitress made my boyfriend and me feel like a burden. Sitting next to the door, I watched as people piled in without being greeted or seated for more than 15 minutes. I would like to add that there were multiple tables available. 

I ordered the Berry waffles and my boyfriend ordered Chicken and Waffles. The visual aspect of the food was wonderful (check pictures below). The taste, was disappointing though. The fruit was not fresh and the strawberry syrup overpowered the whole waffle. My boyfriend liked the chicken and waffles, but then later sat weird with him. I could tell the kitchen was in a rush when preparing the food too. 

Overall, I am disappointed with my experience. However, I am going to attribute the poor service and taste with the restaurant being under staffed. I will try to go back one more time before I make my final judgement. Hopefully, the staff will be plentiful with smiles on their faces- even during a rush."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have become Sunday regulars at this place. Try to breakfast magic. Nothing tops it. 

Tip-long wait because it is sooo good. Worth it, but go when you have time!"}
{"text":"There must be only ONE server here! The server is rude and rushes you through the experience. Giving you NO time to decide what you want! (It's a very detailed and intricate menu) it's just not the way I wanted to start my Monday morning."}
{"text":"Good food.  Decent prices. Appropriate portions.  Boring atmosphere.  They did the best they could in a strip mall building.   Clean and bright.   It is a solid choice, but didn't get \"wowed\" by the experience."}
{"text":"Solid brunch spot. Got the funky monkey which at first I thought was way too sweet but the peanut butter on top was the perfect hint of savory to balance it all out. The flavor was good but not great I wish the waffles were a bit warmer. Beautiful presentation however and their syrup options really hit all the flavor profiles. I must try the chicken and waffles or the build your own next time I come around. 

The service was fantastic, luckily I came on a weekday at around noon and avoided the crazy weekend brunch rush."}
{"text":"OMG! Was this a good choice after a 40 min wait? Yes it was! The menu is great and although you can have your waffles with any combination you can think of, they also have other options like omelettes and kids breakfast. 
I ordered the Carnivorous omelette and it was delicious....of course, it has bacon. 
We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst customer service experience I have ever had at a restaurant. Service was extremely slow. They were busy. Food was mediocre at best. I've had better Eggo waffles than what we had. The waffles had absolutely no taste to them. It was like eating soggy bread. We got one refill of coffee while there for an hour. We each got a half a cup and they were full of grounds.

I would have complained, but there is a story behind that. One of the servers whacked my wife in the back of the head with a heavy serving plate. It left a large welt on the back of her head and was very painful. When the \"manager\" finally made her way over to us to \"apologize\" once she was done talking to her friends, she left. Not that I was looking for anything, but she sent the server over later to tell us she was giving us 10% off our meal because of the trouble.

I was more insulted by that, than the accident. What if this had been a senior citizen or a child. Maybe you shouldn't seat people behind the serving pick up line where they are in danger. We only think you were a little bit hurt, so here is $3 off. We will not return.

I did forget to mention that the manager brought us a fruit bowl about 30 minutes later.

I did speak with the owner, and he offered us a do-over. Over a week has passed, I guess he is not going to follow through on his promises, as the gift certificate he said he would send has not arrived."}
{"text":"The inside area is very dirty, the service was slow, and the menu was misleading. Don't order the home fries, it's a vegetable medley. The server never came back for our check so eventually we had to use cash instead of card."}
{"text":"After looking at all of the positive reviews for this place, I had to try it. I don't know if I just had a random, fluke of an experience, but I was pretty darn unhappy with my food. I had an Eggs Benedict type waffle and didn't even finish it. It had crab on top of it and although I know this is probably not their fault, I bit something hard and when I pulled it out of my mouth it looked like a small rock, or a big piece of sand. My food also tasted... Off? Like I shouldn't be eating it... So I didn't. My boyfriend echoed my disappointment and described the experience as \"disappointing.\"

The only thing I can really praise is the breakfast potato side. It's a little bowl of perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked tricolored potatoes. They even have sweet potatoes mixed in. 

But would I recommend eating here? Nope. Will I go back? Nope. Not even for the potatoes. 

If I crave waffles I'll go to The Wafflonia."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast. Waffles and then some. Had the Southern Waffle. Just a little short in the sausage inside the waffles. Bourbon syrup not very thick and lacked taste. Service was quick and friendly. Will try again. I was torn between the bennies and the southern. Should have gone bennies."}
{"text":"Waffles INCaffeinated is one of those places I'm destined to love.  Any breakfast delight I can smother in syrup usually is a win-win for me...  unfortunately, Waffles just didn't live up to the height.

I'm not sure if it was the shotty service (the first thing our waitress did was apologize for what she expected to be \"a bad day\"), or if it was the fact that there was a small horde of fruit and table flies throughout the restaurant, but we were ready to leave the second we got our food.

My berry waffle was ok, but I could of made better at a hotel breakfast buffet.  The wife's crab benedict waffle was much better, but the few pieces of crab sprinkled on top of it didn't really justify the name (it must be a reoccurring theme because the table next to us asked for the manager to complain that no crab could be found nor tasted in their crab omelettes).

The one saving grace of this place was the fantastic homefries, a medley of blue, russet, sweet, and fingerling potatoes that were perfectly fried.  Judging by the reviews, I'd say maybe we just had an off day, but I likely won't find myself giving it another shot."}
{"text":"Needed a good breakfast on Friday after having had a couple beers the night before at Hofbrau House.  (I am not usually a drinker and was feeling it!) We drove to this place but was disappointed it didn't open until 0800.  The Funky Monkey was on special at 5.00, so I ordered that and egg on the side; I asked how many eggs you get for 3.50 - you get two.  I am very specific about how I want my eggs cooked and the waiter was very nice and said they would be served that way as he too does not like gooey eggs.  So surprisingly, the eggs were cooked just as I liked them and even better than I expected (buttery and flavorful) and the waffle was really good too - although I wish I had asked for the syrup (and yes, it was offered).  Coffee refills were given and also, the coffee is good.  By the way, as it was Friday, there was no wait.  Service seemed very fast."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and I find myself always craving it on the weekend. They have a very unique selection of food choices, so you might have to go outside the box. I have had the mega berry which was very sweet, fresh, and yummy. I have also had the Breakfast magic which was amazing. I was unsure about having an egg bacon and cheese in/on my waffle, but it was delicious. I look forward to coming back and trying something else!"}
{"text":"In a half empty restaurant, we were told that even though we could be seated, it would probably be at least 30 minutes before we would be served because they only have 6 waffle makers. How does a WAFFLE restaurant only have the capacity to make 6 waffles at a time, when that's essentially the only thing they serve?  That might get you through on a Tuesday, but Saturday morning during brunch time you're basically turning away customers who will never come back given the plethora of options."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place while I visited the burgh. We put ourselves on the waitlist via yelp so we wouldn't have too long to wait. My friend that lives in Pittsburgh said there is always a line. We were seated outside not too long after we arrived, the staff is friendly and fun. They have sweet and savory waffles and you are able to go crazy with ingredients and toppings. I had a half of a gluten free waffle, it was good ( fluffy and light) with bourbon maple syrup. The portions are good and filling. I'm glad I tried it and will most likely go back"}
{"text":"The wait at Waffles Incaffeinated can be ridiculous, but there's a reason there's a wait.  The food is incredible.  My boyfriend and I snuck in here on Saturday for a 1:30 table.  We didn't have a wait as the rush had died by then.  If you can wait that long or wake up super late, then I would suggest that as the perfect time to go.

They are also on the No Wait app, so we've gone there before using this app.  It makes it so much easier to plan for.

I ordered the Straw-nana Crepe with Home Fries and they are beyond amazing.  We also ordered flavored shots to go with our coffee.  Our waitress was nice and the staff all seem to enjoy their job.  I observed them joking around with each other, so it helps the atmosphere.

I've seen some other ratings complaining about the wait for food. You do seem to wait a really long time, even if you order the minute you sit down."}
{"text":"I love this place and every time I bring guests they love it too. The peanut butter banana funky monkey is he bomb and eggs Benedict with crab is fantastic. Personally I love the berry one."}
{"text":"I've been to the location on the southside several times and I've never been disappointed. There's great service and delicious food. There's usually a wait to be seated but it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Server was very friendly, but was not very good. The coffee cups are very small, and she was pouring half cups of coffee. The coffee also tasted like bad gas station coffee. Surprised since breakfast places usually have great coffee. Our food took a really long time and the people next to us waited an hour for food because the server forgot to put in the check. We've all been there. The checks got messed up and I ended up being charged for double what we owed. The manager was very nice and did as much as he possible could to fix the situation. So, breakdown....foods amazing, service is bad(this time), coffees gross, but the staff is very friendly. We will be going back after they get more settled into this new location."}
{"text":"Honestly thought the waffles were over priced until I went for the first time and they are absolutely amazing. They're not heavy at all but very light and fluffy. I will be going back again."}
{"text":"Not a  good first  impression. Long wait for a table, while other tables sat empty for 10 minutes or more.  Went for breakfast ended up eating lunch due to wait. The food was good, but not worth the wai"}
{"text":"Came to this place while visiting with my friends from Miami for the fins steelers game. This was by far my favorite part of my trip! Food was amazing, I had the chicken and waffles with a side of gravy( a must) ... fantastic!"}
{"text":"The hype is real.  Had the chicken and waffles with a dollop of hot sauce as well as the bansna fosters and split with my guy.   The chick and waffles served as entree and second the desert.  Perfect amount to feel stuffed.  Great taste.  Only cons were they ran out of chai and ran out of the pumpkin special that day.   
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So good waffles! Funky monkey and breakfast magic are a must try. Awesome stuff! I'm definitely going back again."}
{"text":"Go to Waffles INCaffeinated and get your grub on. I did.

What I ordered was a caprese and crab omlet a cappuccino and a side of bacon and an orange juice.  The restaurant was empty when I arrived there at 10:30am so I had my pick of where to sit.  The color scheme appealed to me. I took a liking to everything from the black bamboo textured walls to  the earthy green paint color and black wood tables and chairs through out. There was a vibrant and healthy palm tree in the rare of the restaurant that  was adorable.  The green color  Waffles INCaffeniated picked for the restaurant is literally my favorite color it's like they painted the place just for me.  I would absolutely adore having this color scheme in my home.

My one and only complaint was that my bacon was not drained of grease and did not taste anything of apple wood smoked bacon. I felt I was being a little greedy when I ordered the side of bacon. I should have said no.  Aside from that everything was great.

I took a risk eating crab for breakfast but it paid off. 

I cannot wait to visit this restaurant with my boyfriend who loves waffles. 

Great location , great service and mighty fine decor."}
{"text":"Wow. we went thinking this place was so terrific. service was good,but food was just ok and they didn't have everything on the menu and everything was extra. you get a plain waffle or plain omlet . everything is extra. toppings and fillings. very dissapointing."}
{"text":"March 23, 2014

Second time here & not my last! Out on a visit to University of Pittsburgh this time with my husband & daughter. We knew this will be our Sunday meal before heading back to Schuylkill County! 

Again I must say there was a 30-45 min wait but the wait is well worth it so be patient! 

I went with the breakfast magic this time with an egg over easy! Oh my heaven! Savory waffle goodness! Bourbon syrup was the magic touch to this signature waffle! 

My daughter decided to build her own. Going savory she added to the inside bacon, cheddar & spinach. Outside was a fried egg & tomato. She too went for the bourbon syrup & was a happy girl! 

My husband went for a full order of sausage gravy waffle. Gravy was over flowing with sausage. 

Both my daughter & husband had the fresh coffee. It was good & hot & refilled quickly. 

Staff is friendly, talkative & keep things moving & fun! 

I can't stress enough how you must try this place at least once on your Pittsburgh travels! I'm going sweet waffle next trip! Hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"It's sad that I have to leave an upgraded review for this place and knock it down three stars. Just to start, this has nothing to do with the food. I still recommend getting the homefries if you go here, but I knocked the stars because of the service. 
Upon arrival at 1:22pm (closes at 2, so I figured it wouldn't be a big deal) I felt unwelcomed by the hostess who was hesitant to seat me. I got over it and was happy to be seated but felt rushed to order. After my food came out she asked if I wanted anything and I asked for ketchup, after waiting 5 minutes she still never brought it out so I just ate without it. 
While I was eating, they were closing down the shop, wiping and spraying all of the tables (around 1:40pm), and organizing the silverware for the next day at the table across from me. The only thing I wanted to do was leave! The waitress was nice to me, but she and the others were extremely inconsiderate of the guests in the restaurant (2 other couples). I will never return here just because of this experience. If you close at 2, that's when you start wiping down tables and stop seating people."}
{"text":"This is a good breakfast place to eat once a month if you live in the Southside get homefries"}
{"text":"So good, bf and I both enjoyed throughly- waitress really nice.  A tad chilly inside- but  top notch food!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while as I love breakfast food! This is a smaller restaurant and we went on a weekday, so it was not very crowded. The waitress was friendly. I ordered the make your own waffle with mix-ins of pecans and raspberries, with toppings of cheesecake cream and raspberry sauce. I also ordered a side of home fries. The waffle was crisp and light, and with the compliment of toppings and mix-ins, was not overly sweet. They have a trio of syrups to choose from... maple, bourbon and vanilla bean. The vanilla bean and maple were tasty; but my husband and I found the bourbon to taste almost medicinal. The home fries were the star of the meal; a variety of potatoes with peppers and onion, perfectly crisp without being oily. They also were very well seasoned... any more and they would have been too salty."}
{"text":"We always wondered why there was a long line for this place on the weekends. Now we know! The food was amazing. I'm not really a waffle lover or really a sweet breakfast eater, so I was worried I wouldn't find anything. Then I saw Eggs Benedict with Crab on top of Waffle. I think it was called the Benny. It was so freaking good! The waffle wasn't too sweet, there was a generous amount of crab, and the hollandaise was to die for. And the coffee was good too! My hubby got crepes and enjoyed them as well. It was refreshing to find a place with unique breakfast items. I'm so tired of eggs and bacon. Go here."}
{"text":"Yes. Do it. The carnivore omelette and/or pretty much any choice of waffles. Even my bfs homefries and my side of fruit were great."}
{"text":"I would rate higher but they have insects flying all over. Expect to wait for a table on weekend. Servers are friendly and prompt. They need to do something about insects and such."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The staff is super helpful and accommodating. The waffles are the size of your face and the consistency is great. The fall flavor is pumpkin, yum! The berries & the waffles with bacon and green onions are delish! The waitress remembered that it was my first time and I was visiting so I got the berry waffle for free because the kitchen made an error. Oh my goodness! I got to try both sweet and savory. Also, tea lovers rejoice they have organic tea in addition to all their awesome coffee!"}
{"text":"Very creative menu and good food. I liked the design your own waffle or omelette,there were lots of good choices for ingredients. The pan fried potatoes were excellent. We had good service.  It's a clean restaurant and a sunny ambiance."}
{"text":"Food was very good. I had the monkey waffle with bananas. The service was really bad. We waited over an hour for our food. We were in this restaurant from 10 am to 11:30 am which is ridiculous for breakfast. I would go back for the food but expect to wait a very long time."}
{"text":"The best breakfast place in Pittsburgh...Sometimes the service is poor, but the food is outstanding! The BC breakfast is always done right and the perfect way to start the day"}
{"text":"good food.  slow service.  
need to clean their front windows, and the walls along the tables, and bathrooms!  especially the carson street glass"}
{"text":"After feeling too much like a regular at some of my favourite spots, I decided to give this place a try and was pleasantly surprised. My first impression of the decor was that it was a little tacky and felt out of place for a breakfast/lunch spot, but I got over it. 

The restaurant was almost empty (it was a Monday morning) and the server was my kind of server: took our order, refilled water and coffee quickly, and didn't make mindless small talk. I ordered the Funky Monkey and home fries. Both left me satisfied and feeling somewhat gluttonous, but whatever. The home fries were a mix of Yukon gold, purple, and red potatoes dusted in a ranch powder that I could eat every day. The peanut butter chiffon on top the waffle was decadent, light, and sweet with a hint of salt. Yes, please. 

Overall, I was pleased with the joint. My only complaints are the decor and music selection--it was a terrible mix of early 2000s emo and mid-2000s garage rock everyone listened to in high school. I'll go back."}
{"text":"The waffles were done well here, but I would expect them to be at a place with \"Waffles\" in their name.  I ordered the chicken & waffles, which came out without the scallions that were supposed to top it. The waffles were delicious and the chicken was crispy. The wait staff could not check often on us since the restaurant was crowded, which was a problem because the coffee mugs were small (probably 6 oz) and it was hard to get a refill.  Overall a good experience, but not sure I would go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"The food was amazing andnevwryone we were with loved it! However the service was terribly slow! We waited over 45 minutes to get our food after ordering. 

I had the sausage and gravy waffle which was out of this world! The omelettes are excellent as well!"}
{"text":"O. M. G. Soooo delicious. I tried the monthly special. It is fantastic! I want to live here and eat every meal here. Plus, the 80's music really perked me up. :)"}
{"text":"I heard through word of mouth that this place was very good.  I checked out Yelp to see some of the reviews and ratings and I was sold.  There was a bit of a wait when I got there with my friend, but it was no problem.  The host took my phone number and told me it would be about 20 min so my friend and I decided to walk around for a little to pass the time.  I received a phone call after about 15 minutes and we were good to go.

The decor was really nice.  Didn't strike me as consistent with a place known for waffles, but I'm not complaining! Our waitress was very nice and took good care of us.  We never really had to wait for anything.  

I can't remember the name of the dish I ordered, but it was a waffle that was stuffed with peppers and chorizo with an egg on top.  It was amazing.  The peppers had so much flavor and so did the chorizo.  It was delicious.  I asked for the egg on top to be cooked over easy and it was exactly right.  This meal was unbelievably filling and I would recommend it to anyone.

They had a little trouble with their credit card machine right at the end of our visit, but they ended up getting it fixed so there was no trouble.  All in all this was a great experience from start to finish and I would go back."}
{"text":"I have heard so much about Waffles Inc. that I had to try it. My sister and I decided to go around 9 am on Black Friday before we started our Christmas shopping. I checked \"No Wait\" & there wasn't one (there ALWAYS is on the weekends) so we decided to check it out. We were seated right away. It's not very big in the place- I can see how outdoor seating during the spring/summer helps them a lot. My sister ordered potatoes & eggs, I went with the chicken & waffles. The potatoes she ordered were beautifully presented- they use multi-color potatoes, making them a little unique. She also liked her eggs. I wasn't so impressed with my chicken & waffles. They weren't bad, but I've definitely had better chicken & waffles from places that don't have \"waffles\" in the name. I didn't even finish the entire waffle. It wasn't bad, it was just average. Our server was friendly the entire time & was attentive to our table. I would probably return, but I'm not rushing back any time soon."}
{"text":"I feel that breakfast food can sometimes get repetitive. It's generally the same thing in different forms. Waffles Incaffeinated has put a fun twist on breakfast food. When I showed up there was no wait which I was thankful for. I'm impatient and almost never stay at a place where I have to wait or can't make a reservation. 

I started with a gingerbread latte which was perfect!! I will forever compare all gingerbread lattes to theirs. For my main dish I went with Breakfast Magic. It was a savory waffle with eggs bacon cheese green onions and some sour cream. I also got a side of pico de gallo. It was great. I do wish the egg would have actually been scrambled and not like an omelet with nothing on it. If I'm wanting a waffle this is a place I wouldn't mind visiting again."}
{"text":"90 degrees in Pittsburgh & the air was either broken or barely working at all. Floor was dirty. Took a while to get greeted & served but the restaurant was not very busy overall. A few servers/employees were singing loudly entire time which I found to be extremely annoying. My waffle was fine but nothing too exciting. Won't return."}
{"text":"Servers recommendation was chicken and Waffles with a side of sausage gravy. Best recommendation ever! Delicious fluffy waffler and Souper sausagey gravy. It was perfect with the bourbon maple syrup."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Absolutely delicious.

However, it is very pricey for a breakfast place and the service leaves something to be desired. If you offer unlimited coffee and give me a very small cup to drink from, please check back if I need more. I got my first cup, which was gone quickly, then never got a single refill.

Also, seeing other peoples plates and trash laying on nearby tables is a serious restaurant turnoff for me. There were several dirty tables when we walked in that remained that way.

But the food is still amazing so I will be back again, and hopefully the service will be a little better."}
{"text":"I went to Waffles Incaffeinated with my roommate, as we live near it. Be prepared for a  wait! They use the NoWait App, so I suggest putting your name in before you head on over! 

Both times I got the Souther' Waffle because it was JUST THAT GOOD. 

Service takes a little longer than normal, but I'm attributing that to how busy it was both times I went. 

Overall, great place to go if you have some time on your hands!"}
{"text":"Great coffee!  The South Side location is in the midst of a great youth-skewing neighborhood filled with an eclectic mixture of shops, bars and restaurant. 

The Souther Waffle (waffle and fried, boneless chicken) is simply outstanding. My daughter loves it. My wife hade the Mega-Berry waffle, which she enjoyed immensely. I had an omelette, which was big, hot and tasty. 

Reasonable prices for a lot of food."}
{"text":"This place was pretty amazing. First, part of my party got there before me so I am not sure how long they waited, but we had 8 people on Saturday at 12 and were seated really quickly. Hat's off to them for their quick service.

The server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I only wished I knew about the build your own waffle before I started.

THE WAFFLES! YUM! I am not even a huge waffle or pancake fan. I had the Waffles Benedict with bacon instead of crab. It was delicious! I didn't need syrup! Speaking of syrup, they have an AMAZING collection of different types of syrups to try out. I was a bit disappointed that they didn't offer it up to anyone. My boyfriend had to ask for it. He got the bourbon syrup. It was in a Jim Beam bottle! I was soo impressed with it, but sad they didn't offer their awesome syrups upon ordering or delivering the food. I will have to go back and try the other kinds! They seemed like they were a hot commodity as another server came over to pick up the syrup and pass it onto another table. Try them! They are delicious.

Overall, the service was good, food was a little pricey for what it was but well worth trying out. I'll definitely be back to try a new dish, and syrup for that matter."}
{"text":"Really great/gigantic waffles.  A bit of a wait and service was a tad slow, which is why I only gave it 4/5 stars, but great food.  Will come back."}
{"text":"I planned to eat here with my family on a Saturday morning visiting Pittsburgh.  We walked in and my first impression was that the place was a hot mess.  There were numerous empty and dirty tables. There was also food on the floor.  

When we got to the waitress she gave us a very smug and also gleeful report that they had an hour wait - like she was proud of it or that I was some sort of moron because I did not call ahead.  Maybe if they were a bit more efficient at getting the tables cleaned up they could get a few more people seated.

I went to the place across the street - Cucina Vitale - and it was it was fantastic.  I am soooo glad these guys could not seat me.  Never coming back here."}
{"text":"The waffles are yummy and the service is good. Not very crowded during the week. Try the mega berry waffle!"}
{"text":"This place closes at 3 so HURRY UP! I orderend a sasuage and onion waffle and it was just ok. I ordered a chocolate, peanut butter and banana waffle and it was good. I wasn't blown away by anything but the sweet stuff was good."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for brunch on a Saturday around 10am. If you come here on the weekend, anticipate waiting in line for anywhere from 20 to 45 minutes. I 100% felt the wait was worth it! You can also order to-go breakfast if you don't feel like waiting. 

I chose the Benny which is half a waffle with thick Canadian bacon, a poached egg, hollandaise sauce, and lump crab meat on top. Oh. My. Goodness. I can't wait to go back! My husband had the Breakfast Magic which was a whole waffle with bacon, cheddar, and green onions, and a fried egg on top. It had sour cream on the side, and my husband added an extra fries egg and Sriracha. He said it was fantastic. 

I ordered a cappuccino but was told that their coffee machine is a little wonky and that it may actually be a latte. I thought this was odd since I know the difference between the two and didn't want a latte. I went ahead with the drink anyway and enjoyed it. Service was good and everyone was pleasant. I noticed a few people were taking coffee to go although I did not do this. 

I recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"I wish I could dine here every week, I can finally say that after being here four times and having an absolute wonderful meal each time! 

On my most recent trip I tried their omelet, I figured I should change it up a little! I had the Southwest, which was sooooo good. A little too spicy for my liking, but this was my fault for not asking for it without the peppers. Lesson learned. :) Their homefries were probably in the top 3 I have ever had!! A wonderful mix of white, sweet and purple potatoes. They were not fried or greasy, but instead like little puffs of potato pillows. SO good!! 

I'm already looking forward to my next visit!! It's also a great place to take out of town guests. The decor is nice and the meal will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"You need to go here!  They have an amazing menu full of breakfast classics that you'd expect, but they also mix things up a bit by offering some of those same classics with a twist like the Southern Waffle with an egg, cheese, sour cream, and salsa,  or Eggs Benedict with crab meat served on a waffle. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Excellent stop for breakfast.  Sausage gravy was probably the best ever.  Also tried the berry waffle, funky monkey and ckn waffle- all spectacular.  On my list of TOP breakfast spots."}
{"text":"Perfect amount of food. They don't overdo it with making it super heavy. Get the funky monkey and add stuff to it. I added raspberries and strawberries and it was so good. Seriously the best syrup on the planet. I loved it there. Just factor in some time to wait for seating, this place is and should always be busy."}
{"text":"Do you love a good waffle? Yes. Then Waffles incaffeinated is for you. Not a huge waffle fan? Enjoy a more savory breakfast? Then Waffles Incaffeinated is for you too! This menu has something for everyone. The girls and I recently headed down to Waffles INC for our monthly brunch on a beautiful Saturday morning in the burgh. Southside was just starting to become busy as people slowly awoke from their alcohol induced slumber and meandered outside to start their day. For those of you who were never SS residents, it was 11 am. Waffles INC was packed! Always a good sign. We waited for about 10 minutes and we had a table. 

I couldn't believe the extensive menu! Waffles with fruit, waffles with eggs, waffle sandwiches, waffle pancakes and just in case their numerous concoctions didn't spike your interest, make your own waffle! Being a sweet lover myself, I chose the waffle crepes with fruit and my usual side of bacon. As we were waiting for our meals, we watched in aww as the funky monkey was delivered to a nearby table with a quarter of a chocolate bar sticking out the top of a large scoop of ice cream. Think a deconstructed waffle cone with bananas. I almost asked to change my order right there. When our meals arrived, I was glad that I stuck with my first choice, the crepes. The waffle inspired crepes were textured and crisp. Not what you would expect from a crepe but delicious none the less. The fruit and cream filled out the dish perfectly. The girls also enjoyed their dishes the pancakes (also waffle inspired) and the eggs benedict. Overall, I can't wait for my next trip to Waffles Inc. Watch out Funky Monkey. You will be mine."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! It is in a trendy area, and the place has a good vibe. The breakfast tacos were phenomenal. I would definitely eat them again. My group was seated quick, but when I was leaving around 11 the line was way out the door. So come early. This place is small, and very hipster. Prices were reasonable. Food took a while to come out, but I was in good company so it was all good. Support local! This is so much better than a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"What a unique place for breakfast!!! While just slightly over priced, the menu gives you a wide variety of meals to choose from!!  I had the chicken and waffles which was fabulous and the vanilla bean syrup they offer is spot on!  While the waitress worked as fast as she could - I do feel that a busy breakfast hour should have more than 2 waitresses working!  The place lacked in decor that was welcoming and would tie in the unique food with the over all experience of the place! This location is located in a small strip mall area in Wexford where the parking lot could stand to be slightly larger.  Most concerning would be the entrance and exit to the parking lot - if you're making a left hand turn from the parking lot you may be waiting for awhile on a busy highway at a busy travel hour.  I rated a 4 because my boyfriend and I enjoyed the food so much!"}
{"text":"Delicious. 

Seriously.

I went there with two friends...and we are three very talkative ladies. When our food came there was nothing but small noises of joy coming from us. Well, me mostly. The other ladies were better able to keep their foodgasms under control.

I had the french toast: Italian bread dipped in batter and then pressed in the waffle iron. There was a delicious marscapone creme smear on my plate that was so good that I wanted to rub it all over my face and live like that forever. The maple syrup was a perfect compliment. It was seriously so. effin. good.

My friends were just as pleased with their meals. One got the monte cristo which she said was the best she'd ever had, and the other got...I think it was the Magic? Don't quote me on that, but I think that's what she got, and she said it was awesome.

Coffee was really good. My friend got tea and it seemed as though there was a nice selection. 

Service was super friendly and prompt. We got there at 11 and the place was almost empty, but there was a wait by the time we left.

I am going back sooner rather than later and next time will try one of their savory options!"}
{"text":"This is a five star breakfast place.  The gluten free waffles are excellent and the house made syrup.  Highly recommend the potatoes.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The waffles are great. The service is a little slow, but that seems to be due to understaffing rather than inattentiveness on the part of the waiters. Great price for what you get. My gf and I split the Funky Monkey and it was more than enough food. I love that they have soy milk as an option for coffee/lattes."}
{"text":"The wait was ridiculous. The hostess said 15 min which seemed ok since there weren't a lot of people. However, we waited for a good 30-35 min while there were 2-3 tables just sitting there waiting to be cleared off. 

Once we were seated and ordered the wait continued. We didn't see our waiter again. I'm not sure if he was hiding in the back or what but I had to ask another server for a coffee refill (they use mini coffee cups).

Food took forever to get to our table. Once it arrives, my wife's was cold to the touch. Sent it back and waited even longer for a replacement. 

Food isn't bad but a lazy restaurant. Look at other reviews and you'll see that staff and times are just slow. 

Go down the street to Double Wide Grill for a nice Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Get there around 8am or have a longggggg wait. But it's a long wait well worth it. When my parents came to visit my mom loved it so much we had to go twice!
Home fries are killer!  But obviously you go for the waffles. 
Get the NoWait app to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"Not worth the hour and half long wait. Ordered the Benny and got half a waffle with subpar lobster? Very weird combination. I witnessed the waiter pre-bus a table and drop a fork then instead of picking of the fork, he continued to kick it back to the kitchen. I feel as if it was overpriced for what I got. Don't recommend."}
{"text":"Cold food,home fries were soggy and not fresh.One odd experience as I have had better days here."}
{"text":"Waffles with sausage gravy. My goodness. The wait was abominable, but thank goodness for early check in options. The food was ABSOLUTELY worth the wait. The waffle was fluffy and broke apart comfortably with a fork (no mashing and tearing and gnashing of teeth required), the gravy was rich and flavorful, and the place smelled divine. I had a side of the home fries with a poached egg and mushrooms on top. EXCELLENT. The egg came out and my friend commented on how it looked like a fluffy cloud. Poached to perfection and soaked up some of my hangover like a charm. This place isnt one I'm likely to forget the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast at around 8:15 am on a Sunday morning and it was awesome! I'd heard the wait was long on weekend mornings, but I guess the rush doesn't start that early. Our server was Justin and he was great. He was friendly and attentive, which isn't always common in customer service so early in the morning. 

I ordered the Country Benedict with sausage gravy on the side, which was delightful. My friend orders the BC Breakfast, which was quite large but very tasty. We also ordered the bottomless coffee with flavor shots, which is a great value for a low price and the refills even come with smaller cups for additional flavor shots. 

Overall, my experience here was wonderful! The food and drinks are good prices and filling, plus the service is great. I'll definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I came in with a group of 11 on St. Patty's day. Not only was it a holiday but it was also my best friends 21st birthday. It's a small very busy restaurant and we waited a while to be seated. We brought our own alcohol and the waitress made sure to provide us with everything we needed even a bottle opener! The service and food was amazing! Our server Cynda went above and beyond! She even brought out a lit candle so we could sing Happy birthday without being asked to do so! Our food came out quickly and exactly how it was ordered. The atmosphere of this place rocks and we'll definitely be back. So worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Terrible......Do not go!!!! McDonalds is north just up the road on the same side. I suggest you go there."}
{"text":"Our server Tina was extraordinary. Came to the table with fresh grapes from the vine for us before we had even given her our drink order. After I indulged  myself in some lustful fruit passion, Tina recended a bottle of 72 merlot. I was hesitant but three bottles and two full pay checks later I have no regrets on the decision. My main course consisted of a veil steak which was perfectly cooked medium rare. Kudos to the kitchen. It's like they had the baby cow in the back strung up waiting for me. Twas so fresh and tender. My bill was reasonable considering how much I got. The service and food was so good I left a 200% tip for the server and sent a twenty back to the kitchen boys. Waffles is a must for anyone and everyone of all ages. Especially if you're hungry!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, but the ticket time was terrible. We order and 20 minutes later the waitress came to apologize and said \"our ticket times are slow today\" it took 50 minutes from the time we ordered until served. The waitress was great, food was amazing, but kitchen was terrible in speed."}
{"text":"By far my favorite breakfast place in the pittsbburgh area. Great experience every time that i go here. Great staff, great management. You have to try their waffles (obviously) but i havnt found anything on their menu that i dont like."}
{"text":"Some of the of the best waffles I've ever had!  The first time I went on a Sunday morning, my girlfriend and I had to wait 60 minutes, but it was well worth the wait.  Tip to beat the wait: if you are going on Saturday or Sunday, download the \"Nowait app\", which will allow you to get in line from any where (ie while you are geting ready)!  The second time we waited 5-10 minutes (and that was in a Friday!).

The first time we went, I got the Funky Monkey.  It has chocolate inside and chocolate, bananas and a peanut butter chiffon!  So rich but so good!  My girlfriend got the Megaberry which was also fabulous.  We liked it so much that we went back during the same week!  The second time I got the Southern Waffle, which has a nice balance of hot, savory and slight sweetness.  It had jalapeños and sausage inside with Pico de gallo on top!  Their bacon was really crispy and the fruit bowel was jam packed with all kinds of fresh fruits!  My personal goal is to try all of the specialty waffles before being adventurous and creating my own (so many options for mix ins and toppings)!

I would also have to recommend a caramel vanilla cappuccino!

The atmosphere trendy, but the only down side is that some of the seating is very close making it common to get bumped into as people get up or sit down.

Seriously a must try!  It may just become your favorite breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Initial thoughts: I've read some great Yelp reviews about this place, so I should try it. I like waffles so I thought maybe this will be my new favorite brunch spot. To be honest, it was utterly disappointing. I felt like I waste my time here.

Wait time: Seated within 5-10 minutes of arrival, but the wait time for the food is about 45 minutes - 1 hour (not worth it). 

Service: The waitress barely checked up on us. Came by with the food, and only one time for water. 

Main dish: When I got my food, I expected it to be at least warm. I got the Benny, and the entire dish was cold. The waffles were NOT crispy. They were actually soggy. The poached eggs were overcooked, the hollandaise was bland, and the crab tasted like it came out of a can. If your restaurant's name has the word \"waffles\" in it, the waffles should be amazing. If you want real waffles that are crispy on the outside, soft in the inside, this is NOT the place.

Drinks: Only had water. 

Cost: $10 for a measly HALF of a waffle (not even a whole one) with 2 overcooked poached eggs. 

Ambience: Casual, family- and group-friendly. 

Overall: Really disappointing food, disappointing service, overall disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place got so many bad reviews!

The hostess was not the friendliest but our server was crazy nice and the food was awesome.

i got a breakfast sandwich was was yummy and I meant to order a side of homefries but forgot so i stole some of my friends and they were probably the best homefries i have ever eaten!

I also got a half a waffle ( i love that you can do that because sometimes you don't WANT that much sweet stuff, or you can't eat it all) and i got peanut butter chips, chocolate chips inside and marshmallow fluff and whipped cream on top and it was perfect!  LOVE that you can create your own waffle!"}
{"text":"I've love Waffles INC a long time--since their New Brighton location and am SO excited for them to have a move convenient for me location.  I love the Funky Monkey Waffle and usually order it as it is wonderful but the first time we came to wexford, I decided to try something new and went with the Chicken and Waffles.  It was wonderful, a ton of food for the money (four full chicken tenders and a huge waffle) and was so delicious.  My dad stole one of my chicken tenders because I couldn't finish.  We were a party of 5 and everything went well.  My Dad had the sausage gravy waffle, my husband had the eggs benedict waffle and my mom designed her own.  Everyone loved their food especially my 4 year old who ate every bite of his eggs and bacon and deemed this his new favorite restaurant so clearly, we will be back :)"}
{"text":"First impressions are everything....


The establishment is cold feeling. Cool blue walls might be fine in summer but not fall and winter. Noise, hard floors, loud music and bright spot lights on customers equal a non inviting environment 

Harsh kitchen smells, tiny coffee cups . They aren't insulated either, our coffee was never hot .

I know too much about the hospitality industry and I spot flaws 

The chairs were very uncomfortable 

The menu is different than many. 3 eggs instead of 2 . The continental breakfast doesn't have an add waffle option. The oj was watered down, not fresh
They brush your waffle with butter, I'd rather do it myself 

The food is presented nicely, very nicely.

.? Why is the vanilla maple syrup clear?

Why on. Earth is the maple syrup, all3 of them so watery? To cut costs?"}
{"text":"Oh goodness.  This place is breathtaking.  The food was so delicious I don't think I spoke during eating except to tell my boyfriend how amazing it was. 
I had the berry waffle and boyfriend had the southwestern style waffle. Both equally as delicious. 
The owner and chef is an Army Veteran / active duty, I wasn't exactly but either way, it's a good thing. 

Absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious waffles, friendly but not very attentive service. I could have used a water refill or two more, but I would definitely go back. They had tables available outside and many great choices on their menu."}
{"text":"What to do on Super Bowl Sunday when the Steelers aren't in it? Head to Waffles INCaffeinated for brunch. 

This location is in a small strip mall - that it is literally in front of North Allegheny High School. There's a small parking lot, but we able to grab a spot.  

We checked the No Wait to see if there was a wait - but there wasn't so we were able to get seated right away. We arrived around 1:45pm and they are open until 3pm - so it wasn't too busy and nice and quiet. 

I ordered the Mega Berry waffle, my mom ordered the Breakfast Magic, my Dad order a custom waffle with apples and pecans, and we split an order of the home fries. My mom and I split our waffles down the middle. However, I enjoyed my Mega Berry waffle more. They also forget to add the whipped cream, but our waitress brought us a side of it. 

They have a loyalty program - so with our visits we were able to get a waffle free or $8.00 taken off the bill. Definitely a great loyalty program. 

I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Actually, this is a 4 1/2 star rating - half point deducted for less than stellar service. The food is off the chart delish!! Going against my natural inclination to order something sweet, I went instead for a savory waffle selection and got the Souther. The jalapeño, cheese and chorizo combination topped with a perfectly cooked over easy egg was too much to pass up! It really was amazing! Who knew stuffing waffle batter with jalapeños was a good idea? Well, it is!! My wife's sweet potato waffle with the figs, apples, cranberries and candied walnuts was totally AMAZING!! I kept reaching over for bites - after all, a sweet AND savory brunch experience seems to be the complete package, right? It was!!

My favorite of the 4 selections was the Fosters though. Bananas, walnuts and ice cream? Oh yeah!! Lovin it!  The Bourbon Maple syrup (Jim Beam and maple syrup) was addicting and I'd go back just for a cup of that alone!

While I understand why it's crowded, I still think the service could have been better. Coffee refills were slowwww (good coffee though!) and I had to wait far too long to get my syrup - to the point that my waffles started to get cold. And I wanted that Bourbon syrup! I'm willing to overlook that this time and hope it was just a bad day.

Next time, I'm going sweet and have already picked out my selection - Funky Monkey. I'm a sucker for chocolate and man, this one made me drool! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast. The mixed variety of potatoes in the home fries were great and souther waffles were nice and savory. They have Franks hot sauce and Sriracha. The place is really busy and the space is a bit tight. My only issues were that the coffee refills could have been more frequent and that is was a bit weird that there was no ketchup or syrup especially on the tables."}
{"text":"Great little waffle/breakfast joint on the South Side.  It was a little pricey and the service was sluggish, but the food was great and the portion was a decent size!"}
{"text":"On my day off from work I figured I would treat myself to some waffles for breakfast! I have been wanting try waffles incaffeinated for a while now and when I found out they were putting one in Wexford I was so excited to try it out. 

For starters it's located in the plaza next to North Allegheny High School and the sign is a bit hard to see from the road, but it's there I promise. I was seated right away and my waitress was extremely friendly and attentive. I ordered the mega berry waffle that comes with whipped cream (I told them to hold the whipped cream), powdered sugar, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and raspberry syrup. The waffle itself is infused with more berries! I also added the vanilla bean drizzle which added some additional sweetness. Their menu has some other options for those that might not be feeling waffles (omelette, French toast and crepes). Pricing is pretty fair for the size and amount of food you get! 

Cons: One thing that I can't say I'm a fan of is leaving and smelling like grease. Yuck! Also, the center of the waffle was a bit doughy, but I guess that's expected when you add a lot of fruity toppings. 

Other than that I would give this place another go!"}
{"text":"We went for the first time on Fathers Day and it was predictably busy. Happy we used NoWait app and got seated in about 5 mins. The server greeted us promptly and courteously and took our orders quickly. The wait for the food was a bit long but again because it was Father's Day they were at max capacity but the entire staff was hustling. The food was really very good ! I had the county mile, waffles, chicken, sausage gravy, and eggs over easy on top. Delicious! I would go back again and recommend to friends and family"}
{"text":"Waffles Incaffeniated is one of those places I have been meaning to get to but not made it to.  So when my friend asked me where I wanted to go for birthday brunch, I suggested here.  We arrived at 9:30 am on a Thursday, and we were probably the first people in for the day.  This made street parking super easy.  The atmosphere is very casual but has a trendy ish vibe.

We decided to get the Benny and the Sausage Gravy waffles.  I think each one was $9.65.  The Benny is Eggs Benedict on a waffle, and they also put crab on top.  The waffle we got was cold and covered in freezing crab.  The actual taste with the warm egg was pretty decent, but no one wants to pay over $9 for half of a cold waffle.  The Sausage Gravy waffles were preferable but still only warm at best.  They were also mushy, implying that our food sat in the back for a while.  So while both options tasted good, they needed some more love and care in the preparation area.  We also ordered a fruit cup that was presented nicely but also freezing.  I am not sure why all of the food was freezing to lukewarm in temperature, but it was a big turn off.

One weird pet peeve, they do not have a working website.  There is nothing worse than choosing somewhere to eat and not being able to see an online menu with current prices.  It's 2016; there is no excuse for no website.

The service here was lackluster as well, and while the idea is creative, I am not totally feeling this place.  I am definitely in the 3-4 star camp for Waffles Incaffeniated, but as I am not running to come back here, I think three stars is more fair."}
{"text":"Went for brunch while visiting my sister at Pitt. There was a wait but it wasn't too bad and there was room to wait inside which was nice since it was freezing out!  I chose this place because they had vegan waffles, but I was pretty disappointed to see that there's a $3.50 upcharge for a vegan waffle and a $2-something upcharge for gluten/dairy/soy free waffle.  It's great to see options, but I don't really understand how they can charge that much for a vegan waffle. That made my waffle cost $15.50 with 4 add-ins which was a little much for one waffle. 
Be warned- each topping/add-in costs $1.25!!!  The menu prices did not have $ signs next to them, so it's easy to not notice prices.  I did not realize that when ordering since the menu said \"unlimited toppings\" (meaning you could technically get unlimited, not that unlimited are included in the price) so don't do what I did and order a bunch and then be shocked when the bill comes. That being said, it was pretty good. I got a soy latte (thankfully no upcharge for soy milk) and I really liked it. All of us liked our food (chicken and waffle, southwest omelet, and souther' waffle). Good hot tea selection. Service was fast and nice. My sister and her friend said they will definitely come back.
Overall- good food but be careful when creating your own waffle and you may be better off making a waffle at home if you're looking for vegan options."}
{"text":"I've loved everything I've tried here. I hate breakfast potatoes but my pregnant appetite was craving them so i figured I'd try- they are incredible! Breakfast potatoes in Pittsburgh are usually sopping in grease, reheated, and lacking in flavor- these were the opposite! Freshly cooked heirloom potatoes served crisp and dry (no grease at all!). I've had the funky monkey, sausage and gravy, and breakfast magic. Sausage and gravy were my favorite but the other two were also delicious. People complain about the wait but if you use the No Wait app it cuts the time down significantly. Try the bourbon syrup! It's amazing! Love their teas too."}
{"text":"Tired of just eggs, pancakes, sausage/bacon etc.?  Then this is the place for you!  I have had a few different of both their hearty breakfasts as well as dessert options.  Every thing was always fresh and delicious!  In addition, the service has ALWAYS been excellent.  They really make you feel that their main objective is to ensure you have a memorable breakfast."}
{"text":"I wrote a blog post about Waffles Incaffeinated and figured I'd share it here: https://www.nataliezazula.com/adventure/2017/11/2/my-favorite-brunch-waffles-incaffeinated

Waffles Incaffeinated is unassuming both inside and out. It is located on E. Carson St near the corner of 25th Street in Pittsburgh's South Side neighborhood. It sits between the office of a State Farm Insurance agent and another restaurant called Wings Over Pittsburgh.

The entry is a little cramped but once you've cleared the server podium the floor space opens. The exterior walls have a black pattern on them while interior walls are painted a bright pea green for contrast. The floor is a light wood and all tables and chairs are made of black metal.  The wall in the back of the restaurant is decorated with three large photos of waffles and it is glorious!

Now, people don't come here for the ambiance. It does it's job and is clean and well appointed but it is nothing special. The food is what makes the restaurant.

Waffles
If the name didn't tell you, Waffles Incaffeinated specializes in waffles. Leslie Knope would love it here! Actually, a friend and I had brunch here on February 13th to celebrate Galentine's Day! #ParksandRec

Anyway, the waffles are the focal point and for good reason. They have savory and they have sweet. If you want a normal plain waffle, you can get that. However, you would be doing yourself a disservice.

Savory Waffles
I swear by the Chicken & Waffles.

They are so DELICIOUS! You get a plate sized waffle topped with fried chicken strips. Here is the website description: \"A Southern classic consisting of a pecan infused waffle with boneless, thick breaded, fried chicken pieces coated with a maple butter glaze and topped with scallions.\" The meal tastes as amazing as it sounds. They also provide multiple syrup options but I also go for the traditional maple (it is infused with vanilla). The waffle is the perfect texture and the flavors all complement each other so darn well.

My friends, Lindsey and Julie, love the Country Benedict and Breakfast Magic. Both of those entrees come with eggs. Here are the respective menu descriptions: \"Two waffle quarters, each topped with a piece of fried chicken, that is smothered with our house made sausage gravy, and crowned with two fried eggs any way you like them\" and \"Crisp bacon, shredded cheddar cheese and green onion on the inside topped with more bacon and cheddar cheese create the perfect resting place for a fried egg* just the way you like! garnished with green onion and a swoosh of sour cream, magical!\"

Sweet Waffles
Now, years ago I would get the Funky Monkey as my meal. It was a chocolate chip waffle covered with fresh bananas and a homemade peanut butter chiffon. It was essentially a heavenly peanut butter mousse. Oh, there was chocolate sauce on top as well! So amazing but it is definitely for dessert and not brunch now. I am unsure how I was able to eat that and feel satisfied for more than an hour.

I've also had the Bananas Foster's before and again...wow. The menu reads: \"Our take on the classic! walnuts inside and out, topped with bananas and a cool mound of vanilla bean ice cream, then smothered with our foster's sauce!\"

Now, let is be known that if you want a sweet AND savory waffle, you have the option of creating your own! There are over thirty mix-in and topping options ranging from coconut to cinnamon and crab to spicy sausage.

Non-Waffles
It has been a hot second since I've had anything other than a waffle as my entree but I can attest that Waffles Incaffeinated has delicious omelets as well. They are referred to as O-My-Lettes here and I know why. They are scrumptious!

The menu has five pre-designed omelettes but just as you can build your own waffle, you can create your own omlette! Seriously, even if you aren't a waffle lover you will still enjoy Waffles Incaffeinated.

I can also let you know that the side of potatoes is amazing! Perfectly crispy potatoes with green peppers and onions. Wow. I always finish mine and help my friends if they cannot finish theirs!"}
{"text":"This place is really nice if you want to have a casual breakfast. Came here on a Monday morning and there was no wait to get seated. The food was great and presentation was very appealing. Great prices for portion sizes.  For all of the food included in the photos the bill was under $30.  Our waitress was kind and prompt."}
{"text":"This place is fine, and I'd eat here again, but I'd never ever wait in a line to eat here.  It's just not that good.  I think waffles should be crispy and these are not; I think that fried chicken for chicken and waffles should also be super crispy and be full pieces of chicken including bones, this is all white parts of a breast and not terribly crispy either.  The bourbon maple syrup was killer, though, and I'd think about giving this place a third shot.  But...not if I had to wait in line."}
{"text":"We just finished breakfast here and I couldn't wait to write this review.The service was outstanding. Our server (I'm sorry I can't remember her name, but she had blue hair) was so wonderful. My daughter was acting weepy all morning and it all finally culminated with her throwing up at WI. Yikes!! I've been a server and I know what a pain this can be when it happens. But our server was so accommodating! She gave us the towels to clean it, brought my daughter some Sprite to settle her stomach, checked on her multiple times, and was generally one of the best servers ever. NOT TO MENTION - all of our food was fantastic!! Fresh and delicious. I'll return here just for the service, and the food is a nice cherry on top. Great job WI! I can't rave enough."}
{"text":"Came in on only their 3rd day of business.  Interior was welcoming and comforting.  Staff was very nice and helpful and the executive chef came out to talk and describe some of the dishes.  They even paired up the perfect syrup to go with our choices.  

Food was creative and very tasty.  I can't wait to try more of their options!"}
{"text":"Just love this place! Quiet and clean - not greasy! Just love their potatoes and onions! I asked for ketchup but really didn't use it. The waffle was light, crisp! I could eat here everyday with the variety of toppings and endless combinations"}
{"text":"The want a waffle mood hit me
I've been to this waffle shop once before figured I would give it another try
I get the concept you can choose your fillings and toppings 
I had a cheese waffle with a scrambled egg & avocado sadly it was just ok sort of bland and blah
My iced chai tea was lovely I really enjoyed it
You might do better with a plain waffle and syrup 
Service was friendly 
It's a very comfortable place 
Easy enough to find metered street parking
15 bucks for a waffle and chai tea"}
{"text":"The wait for a table was long. The wait for our food was even longer. The food was good but not great. Our server was slow, inattentive, and missing at times. We could have gone to Bob Evans for a better overall breakfast experience. I left there feeling extremely underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Only visited once but this restaurant is overrated in my opinion. I tried the funky monkey waffle expecting to be wowed (it looked beautiful) but I was underwhelmed and still kind of hungry to be honest. I would give it another shot to try something different though."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for breakfast. Our go to waffles are the chicken and waffles and eggs benny. Delicious creative menu that you aren't likely to make at home with amazing specialty syrups (we get every one for different bites)! The food is excellent, but the service puts Waffles INCaffeinated far above any other restaurant in the area. Quick service and everyone is so friendly that we feel welcome the moment we walked in the door. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"After years of Pamela's being my Pittsburgh go-to for breakfast, I broke out of my comfort zone and headed to the Southside flats to check this place out. I'm glad I came at 1030 because there's usually a line. I can see why. It's the best urn coffee I've had in town. Friendly,  fast service. But be prepared to carb load. 

The waffles are artisinal, crispy on the outside and chewy in the inside. Not the dry or soggy variety that often parade as an excuse. Chicken tenders and waffles, with added pecans are an honest homage to the southern classic. DO IT. 

But if you are carb intolerant, there are still a bunch of good looking options that I saw go by. As a matter of fact, I could eat breakfast here every day."}
{"text":"Waffles were mushy,,coffee was cold ,ordered blueberry topping the waffles came out with a drip of sauce over it.asked for more sauce charged me extra for it.my grandkids had French toast ,came out with no syrup.the total meal was $32.00 extremely overpriced. Will not return. Waiter was nice though."}
{"text":"Not going to lie I was a bit nervous to try Waffles Incaffeinated,  because of the weekend reviews, but oh my heavens!

I was a bit nervous at first because the hostess, was very sweet and nice, but didn't seem to know what she was doing.. But sat outside, with no wait! Once we ordered we waited about 30 minutes for our food, but considering everything is made to order and most of it is custom you have to understand, there is going to be a wait.

Let me just also say it's been 2+ years since I've had a waffle due to a severe gluten allergy discovery, holy crap it was worth the wait, the GF waffles here are fantastic ! You can't even tell. So light and fluffy on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside, the whipped cream was fantastic. I did not have vanilla syrup I had the maple, and I was not disappointed! My sister had the chicken and waffles and very much enjoyed! Our men liked the sausage gravy waffles!

And I can't help myself, I'm ALWAYS judgemental over breakfast service when it comes to my coffee, it was NEVER EMPTY, so thank you Kaitlyn!. Great experience and great company!

Come EARLY on the weekend, got here 9:50am and no wait.. Within 20 minutes it was an hour + wait!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious but the service is horrible, I waited over an hour for my party of 8 to be split up around the restaurant not even able to see each other. They were seating parties of two at tables meant for 4 people. It was so mismanaged and turned what was suppose to be a nice breakfast into a nightmare."}
{"text":"We randomly decided to get breakfast here since our last visit was unsuccessful due to a long wait. I remembered that they use the No Wait app & quickly put our spot in line via app. It estimated 14 parties ahead of us & about 45-60min wait. You can track your place in line and it went very quickly.. a good 30 minutes.

For breakfast i ordered the funky money & bobby ordered the bananas fosters. We were informed by our server that the bananas were not ready and very green. She offered a substitute & we both decided on strawberries. While tasty, it just wasnt the same. The funky monkey is chocolate, PB & bananas.. not the same with strawberries. Same with bobbys bananas fosters... but we decided it was an excuse to come back and check it out.

While the waffle was fine, service just wasnt too well. After receiving waffle, she asked if we wanted syrup. I asked for maple and bobby vanilla. I waited to eat my waffle for a good ten minutes before she came back refiling coffee and realizing i didnt have syrup.(bobby never got his) This is fine but the last part was odd. When paying, she came back with a booklet and copies of the receipts.. with our table and two others. It's not a huge deal but as a server you should always check card & table numbers when paying and returning back to person

The service & mediocre coffee is stopping me from 4 stars. I do plan to head back and try it out again though."}
{"text":"I went here today for the first time for brunch and I'm glad we did! The food was amazing!! It was well seasoned, the vegetarian omelet was delish, and I absolutely adored the home fries! Of course I had a specialty waffle which also did not disappoint! I will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Dear lord, the waffles eggs benedicts were life-changing. From now on, I want all my eggs benedicts to be just like Waffles Incaffeinated's. The egg was sooooooo perfectly runny, the waffles were fluffy, and the hunk of crab meat made this dish a satisfying portion. And then you pair it with some hot sauce and their amazing bourbon maple syrup? That just elevates these eggs benedicts to another level. So in love. For about $10, these were one of the best eggs benedicts I've had. Sad thing is, it doesn't come with a side. So I ordered a half order of the Funky Monkey waffles.

I'm usually not a fan of sweets for breakfast, but these waffles surprised me! Still very fluffy, just like the eggs benedicts' waffles. The portion size, chocolate drizzle, banana, and dollop of peanut butter is sweet enough to fulfill my sweet cravings, but not enough to send me into a coma. Tip: spread the peanut butter around your waffles before eating them. 

Alright, to the rest of the restaurant.

You have to pay for street parking. I came on a weekday afternoon, so I was seated immediately. Waitresses were super friendly and made sure my $2 bottomless coffee stayed bottomless. On top of that, I got really great recommendations of local breweries to visit since I was touring Pittsburgh from LA."}
{"text":"My first trip to PA, I came here on my last day in town. There was about a 20 minute wait on a Sunday morning. Not too bad when I realized how small the restaurant was. I felt a bit crowded. The back of my seat was touching the persons at the table behind me. I was intrigued by the savory waffle options but I had to go with sweet. I did the berry waffles. It was good, but a bit small for the price. Not very filling. You have a couple options of flavored syrup, which seemed watered down, in consistency and flavor. The waffles were good, but overall, I wasn't too impressed with the experience."}
{"text":"Amazing service, from every person we encountered, probably 8 staff \"touched our visit\" during breakfast.  Incredible how warm and friendly this place is.  It felt like vacation.  It's literally such a positive environment to breathe in the luxurious food and atmosphere while truly relaxing and enjoying the moment.   

The food is creative, delicious and well priced.  You will not leave hungry!  There can be a wait so worth putting your name in on weekends."}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast spot.  Very family friendly.  The vanilla syrup they give you in a bottle to add to your potatoes is an amazing touch.  One of the best vanilla lattes I've ever had.  No booze at this brunch, so keep that in mind.  Also, there's usually a fair amount of kiddos running around, so if you're looking for a more \"adult\" atmosphere, I recommend Local or Steel Cactus."}
{"text":"You must get the meat lovers omelette. To. Die. For. Chicken in an omelette!? Who woulda thunk it!? Ah it has everything. Chicken, bacon, sausage, ham. Then the put a dippy egg on top of the omelette. Again, who woulda thunk it!? Their multi colored fried potatoes are equally delicious as they are nice to look at. They have many types of waffles (obviously, hence the name of the establishment) my boyfriend got ones that had jalapeños on them and pico and came with a jack Daniels infused (if I'm remembering correctly) syrup. Delicious. Everything I've had here is amazing, I cannot give it 5 stars though do to the price. I got a chocolate milk which I realize normally doesn't come with free refills anywhere, but even the one chocolate milk was over priced for the tiny glass it came in. The food is also pricey. The restaurant is not very large either, so there is normally a wait. The staff is generally friendly but I have definitely had better service elsewhere. They also have odd hours, I assume since they are primarily a breakfast place. But otherwise, it's definitely a place to check out next time you're in Southside with a hangover on a Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Waffles Incaffeinated with my out-of-town friend and her dad this past Sun. morning.  Despite anticipating a wait, there was none at the time of our arrival (9am), so we were seated right away.  I had been wanting to visit this place for awhile, given that I'm a waffle fan and that their menu contains many interesting options of both sweet and savory waffles.

Given that I'd never tried a savory waffle and that many reviewers mentioned the eggs benedict waffle, I decided to try it.  My friend and her dad both stayed on the sweet side and ordered megaberry waffles, and he additionally had bottomless coffee.  I can only speak for my waffle, since I didn't try theirs.  The waffle itself was crisper than I expected based on previous reviews, which was great, since I enjoy crisp waffles.  The ratio of toppings to waffle was plentiful, and consisted of the components of classic Eggs Benedict (Canadian bacon, poached eggs, and Hollandaise sauce), as well as some real crab meat and a few scallions.  Unfortunately, I found the Hollandaise sauce rather flavorless and underseasoned, which led me to wonder what went into it (margarine or unsalted butter, perhaps?) and how it was made (blender method?).  Moreover, as others have mentioned, the portion was a bit small, esp. given the price (over $9).

While our server was friendly and courteous, and was able to answer my questions, I also found the 25-30 min. wait for our food to be quite lengthy, esp. given that not all of the tables were filled.  At other places serving breakfast food, the wait has been half as long, which leads me to believe that the kitchen is inefficient at getting out orders in a timely manner. Fortunately, we weren't in a rush, but this is something to consider if you're pressed for time.

Despite these shortcomings, my guests and I enjoyed our meal at Waffles Inc., so I was torn between 3.5 and 4 stars.  However, for me, a 4 star experience must contain no more than one major shortcoming, so 3.5 stars it is.  Having said that, I would certainly be willing to return and to try a different waffle, which would hopefully allow me to increase my rating."}
{"text":"Food was quick to arrive at our table. Presentation was great. My Foster's waffle was overwhelmed with walnuts. My fiancé ordered the BC Breakfast. Once again, presentation was perfection but everything lacked seasoning and flavor. He ordered a side of sausage and that never came."}
{"text":"Waffles were awesome, coffee was delicious and always a full hot cup. Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Um can I live here? This place is wonderful; breakfast is my jam and this place is peanut butter. Sorry I don't know how express how much I could have breakfast, lunch, and dinner here. I want to go back very soon. 

It's just such a smart idea to use waffles in so many different way and I'm glad a place has done this!"}
{"text":"Every one here must be a morning person they are so nice! The staff is vibrant and helpful when it comes to first timers and the menu. Awesome if you love waffles & tri-color potatoes! They have so many options for toppings for a waffle you won't be disappointed and you'll be in love. No worries they already have a great menu with some great toppings and combos with the waffles. Chicken & waffles are awesome here as well as the maple & vanilla syrup. Also they only have red hot & sriracha for options for hot sauce guys just a heads up! For vegans they have something for you & the gluten free folks so it's a dream to come here."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday and was surprised there wasn't a long wait like everyone had mentioned. I guess we just beat the crowd by getting their at 12:30 and signing into no wait at noon. Lots of built your own waffles, sweet and savory waffle dishes. I ordered the funky monkey with chocolate chips in the waffle, peanut butter chiffon dollop on top, then drizzled with chocolate. Definitely too much for me to handle when I got this giant plate in front of me. I do wish the waffle could be a little crispier on the edges.

Wanted to order the chicken and waffle, but the chicken is grilled. Waitress mentioned they will expand that to fried chicken. Not sure how I would feel about that since the you come out of the place smelling like an oily diner already. I would check this place out again."}
{"text":"I had no idea a Waffles INCaffeinated was coming to the Wexford area. I've never been to one before but I have heard of it. I was on the NoWait app the other day going somewhere else for breakfast and Waffles INC popped up (Yes, they are on NoWait!). I didn't go that day but told myself to try it soon. 

I tried it today and I was pleasantly surprised. It's located in the plaza right in front of North Allegheny Senior High School. If you drive too fast, you might miss it. The sign outside is a little small. The environment itself is pretty small too but quaint enough to be a nice-sized diner. It wasn't too busy so we sat down right away. 

They have  a large menu filled with unique breakfast items like chicken and waffles, Eggs Benedict called \"Benny\" with a waffle substituted for the english muffin and topped with crab, and the \"Breakfast Magic,\" which is what I got. It's a waffle with bacon, cheddar cheese, and green onions cooked into the waffle topped with more bacon and cheese as well as a sunny-side-up egg. You can even create your own waffles, omelettes, and crepes with a large array of fillings and toppings. Also, the portion sizes are pretty large. 

I'm a big coffee person so great coffee is key. They have their own brew and I approve of it. You can even pay fifty cents extra to include a shot of flavoring such as gingerbread. You are given a small cup full of the syrup so you can accordingly add it to your coffee. The coffee cups are a little small for my preference but the coffee itself is great. 

If you're looking to try something different for brunch other than your typical eggs and bacon, try this place!"}
{"text":"Went here randomly on a Friday morning at 7am. Couldn't sleep! 
Definitely loved the food... We ere the ONLY people in there though! Felt so bad for the waitress cause she said she had been there since 5am and we were her first table!
Awesome decor and setup...
I had the crab benedict waffle, and my husband had the waffle with chorizo and jalapenos! Absolutely awesome! 
I hope it gets busier because we definitely want to go back soon! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent place! I loved the waffles and that vanilla syrup was something else! 

I had the Carnivore Omelette, it was pretty good, it has a a lot more meat than other places but the side of house fries wasn't too good, cold and rubbery a bit. 

Service was good, super busy so don't expect A1 from them

Definitely great for a breakfast, brunch and get together with friends"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like it... It just wasn't very good, took too long, the service was bad, and we had to ask for everything like sugar for coffee, salt and pepper, napkins. Just really unimpressed. I had the BC Breakfast and it was \"meh\"  and my partner felt the same about the peach something waffles that were their recommended special. The coffee was terrible, that's a bad thing in a breakfast place!

Edit: went again and it was a lot better."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast restaurant of all time. I make a point to go here every time I am in Pittsburgh. The breakfast potatoes are the best. I usually order (and love) their omelettes, but their waffles are great and the sacre bleu berry french toast is a recent favorite. 

My only criticism would be that the restaurant is a bit small, so we have had to wait over an hour to be seated, but that is only a testament to how great it is. If you are heading here on the weekend, just go early and beat the crowd."}
{"text":"Honestly, the eggs were better than the waffles. And the wait takes forever, as well as the service. Definitely recommend the breakfast potatoes though. They are both colorful and delicious."}
{"text":"Oh my god, I have died and gone to breakfast heaven. 

My twin sister went to visit my older sister in Pittsburgh last summer and found this place. They all loved it, so it was at the top of my list of places to visit while in town. This morning, right before we left, we had breakfast here and the anticipation and wait was well worth it.

It was practically empty when we entered. Our waitress and the manager were both very sweet and we were taken great care of. 

My fiancé ordered the funky monkey with espresso dust and loved it. My brother-in-law and twin both ordered the souther' with avocado and they both finished theirs so my guess is they really liked it! My sister had the fosters and it was so good and she really loved it. As for me, I tweaked the breakfast magic, adding mushrooms inside and avocado on top! Amazing. And paired with the bourbon syrup it was so crazy good! 

We also ordered some of the sweet potato waffle fries and they were pretty good, too! The coffee was fresh and refilled quickly. I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here.

It's small, but the use of the space is well thought out.  The staff hustles and quickly preps the tables.

The menu is made up of waffles, omelets and eggs. They like to put green onions on EVERYTHING, so be forewarned. 

I will come back, try something different and review again. But I will be back."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Best coffee ever!  The waffle appetizer was the best waffle in history!   

Then I tried the carnivore omelet but they call it the carnivore O-MY-LET. That was the best thing for a meat lover like me could get. 

The best part of the meal was the home fries. They were cooked and seasoned to perfection. 

I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a breakfast place in the Pittsburg area!"}
{"text":"Went early (right at opening) on a Sunday and there was no wait time. Four of us all ordered something different and no one was disappointed. Even the one who is usually not a waffle person enjoyed the meal. Not a fan of their coffee but their specialty one is so yummy! It is special made one cup at a time so it takes a little while to get it but totally worth it. Service was good. Staff was attentive but very busy as the clientele picked up. Good thing we weren't in a hurry. Some kids this particular Sunday at nearby tables making the place extra noisy but we didn't mind. Good food."}
{"text":"Really good! I had the chicken and waffle with vanilla syrup. YUM! Also the signature latte, I believe! Pretty tasty as well."}
{"text":"The best tasting waffles and everyone in our party had a different topping .. No complaints! Foster was awesome and very filling. Waiter was very helpful and extremely nice. We sat outside which was noisy but nice. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"OMG! Darren and I are Waffles Inc. fans since I lived in Beaver County. It's so cool that they opened one in the city of Pittsburgh. I think it will do really well. We came days after they opened, and they didn't miss a beat. Josh, one of the chefs and owners even talked with us for a bit. Our server was awesome too. This one is bigger than the New Brighton one and has really nice calming green/black decor. The food's the most important thing, and it delivers. The sausage and gravy waffle is mouthwatering as is the Funky Monkey Waffle we shared for dessert. The waffles themselves are so fluffy and good you could probably eat them with nothing on them and they'd still be delicious. Sweet or savory? Waffles Inc has them all including sandwiches and other stuff if you don't feel like waffles (everything was good at the New Brighton restaurant, so I'm sure you can't go wrong here either, but order the yummy waffles or you're crazy!). Great place. Go!"}
{"text":"I read a review on this place for their Crab Eggs benedict. My friend ordered the benedict and I was a little bit disappointed. I expected a whole waffle but it only came with half a waffle. One egg on each quarter which were very small quarters. The eggs on top are not poached eggs, which eggs benedict is supposed to have. The egg yolk was pretty much hard and it was almost like a boiled egg. My friend complained to the waitress. She explained that it was cooked like that for safety reasons which is ridiculous. I guess they don't serve sunny-side up eggs then? She was nice enough to bring another 2 eggs. They yolk was a little bit more runny but not that much better.

I also tried the Waffle Gyro. The waffle itself was really thin, almost like a crepe. It was a decent gyro, a little skimpy on the meat, lettuce, tomato, but the idea of it was interesting. The waffle-crepe itself was soft and buttery.

Next time I'd probably try the sweet waffles instead of the savory ones. Looking at the other tables, the sweet waffles seem huge and loaded with toppings."}
{"text":"I had that funky monkey waffle! It's amazing! You have got to try it! Lots of things are served with waffles even when it doesn't have the word waffle in it!"}
{"text":"I recently made a stop in after visiting my hometown of Pittsburgh. I've heard So many great things that I had to find out for myself. It is a cozy little place and there was a short wait because it was somewhat busy. The waitress was busy so I did not get asked for my drink for about 5 minutes but that was fine. I ordered the chicken and waffles which came out in a reasonable amount of time. The waffles were pretty good but the chicken was a little dry but not terrible. The overall experience wasn't bad and I will return to try a different dish the next time I am in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service!  Waffles are great and the monthly specials are usually pretty good! The coffees and syrups add to the meal as well!"}
{"text":"Poor first impression: Staff doesn't seem interested in keeps by clientele happy.  It likely ruined my whole experience. 
The hostess was slow to seat us despite there being many empty tables.  I watched one potential customer turn around out the door when he saw us and one other person waiting to be seated.  Our waitress showed up quickly but I was 'advised' there were many people ahead of me for a latte (really- one machine?) and it might arrive after our food.   That said my daughter's oj showed up well after the people seated next to and after us got their drinks.  I declined a drink (what ever happened to cranberry juice?) and looked over the food menu.  I can't say the options were all that impressive-  fats and sugars smothering bread for most of it.  Diabetes waiting to happen for about $10-11 a plate.   When I finally got to order I asked for a cup of coffee with a shot of peppermint-  ok European cup sizes with mediocre coffee overwhelmed by huge shot of peppermint and no offer of creamer.  I finally had to ask for creamer. 

Then the food arrived and it was tasty.  A bit more oil was left on my plate than I'd like but overall the food was good.  Certainly better than the service but not necessarily enough to sending be rushing back. For the price, I'd rather head to First Watch.  The food and service is a lot better."}
{"text":"You have to check out this new breakfast spot. It allows you to be creative by concocting your own waffle using a variety of sweet and savory ingredients. You can also get a traditional breakfast of eggs, sausages, etc. update: went back again and was disappointed with the amount of time it took between ordering and receiving our meal. Thought it was a flux the first time but it happened again. Also coffee cups need to be bigger."}
{"text":"I love the chicken and waffles here! The staff here is really nice as well. Good service and food"}
{"text":"We decided to stop here for brunch and learned that they were out of waffles. This was 1130am on a Sunday. 

They do have other items on the menu, which u got a blt and my friends substituted toast for waffles. The food was good, but not mind blowing. I wouldn't be opposed to coming back trying the waffles, perhaps it will earn this place more stars. 

The waitress was very friendly and on top of things. 

I will have to comment on how hot it was in there, they turned on the air but it just seemed like we were really hot for a few minutes then, we got chilly. 

Not a bad place, I would go again, hopefully, they will have waffles."}
{"text":"We waited an hour and a half to be seated. Fortunately, they use NoWait so we could shop a little before we were seated. The staff was super apologetic for the wait time which is fantastic!

I had really high expectations because...WAFFLES! 

We ordered a variety of items and it was really hard to choose because everything sounds amazing!  The portion sizes were right on with all the big breakfast places in the Burgh. 
When the chicken and waffles came it didnt have anything else. No, wet component. It was dry looking. The flavor was good but not what I was expecting. The MegaBerry, on the other hand, was gorgeous and chock full of toppings. My daughter was in heaven. Which, btw, was super cool that they have half portions for kids that comes with a side. Loved that! Finally, the crab caprese omelet. The egg was dry and overcooked. I  saw some crab but didn't taste it. It was bland...I was sad.  BUT, the homefries are a must have! They have a variety of types like sweet and red. Very good! I added the vanulla bean infused syrup on top and I loved it. I added the vanulla bean syrup to my coffee too. I could drink the stuff!

I may try it again but go for the sandwiches or build your own waffle!"}
{"text":"So, we're relocating to Pittsburgh and being a family of foodies we wanted to experience what the hype was about.
We came in and had to wait for about 1/2 hour for a table. They notify you by text when your table is ready which is a great concept. We didn't mind that. When we ordered I started with a latte, single shot, breve, low foam. They couldn't accommodate me, and they didn't know what breve meant. When I asked our waiter who the barrista was he replied he was. I informed him that a barrista would have known what Breve was. Need I go any further? Our food came, and the waffles weren't half bad, but they weren't the best we've had. The service was good, the coffee terrible, and my recommendation would be to take a trip to Philadelphia to the Green Egg Café in Northern Liberties and see and taste what great food is-especially the coffee. Really."}
{"text":"Omg! I LOVE this restaurant! The breakfast menu is huge and the waffles are to die for!
We took my niece and her family who were visiting Pittsburgh and they were very impressed! The staff was friendly and accommodating. I loved the fact that most of them have tattoos ( having numerous tattoos myself!!!)"}
{"text":"OH. My god. Best waffles. Ever. I got the Breakfast Magic and it was indeed magical. A wizard must work in the kitchen. It was so good, I could have eaten the waffle plain and it still would have been AMAZING.  

Eggs, bacon, cheese, and green onions on top of a delicious fluffy and crispy waffle. All the breakfast things I enjoy served in one dish! SO GOOD! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. This place is breakfast heaven! I'm from out of town &found it on yelp... definitely met my expectations! We had the chicken & waffles (with a side of delicious gravy) as well as the Benny which is a twist on the classic eggs Benedict! If I could give it 10 stars, I would!"}
{"text":"The home fries are out of this world! Everything else is a close second.  The wait for a table on a Sunday at 11am was only an hour.  The waiters were very attentive with drink refills and checking back to see if you needed something.  It looks like you would feel squished into your table, but once we were seated, there was enough room.  I would suggest this place for anyone who is serious about good breakfast food."}
{"text":"Visiting family in Pittsburgh and the morning we were leaving my cousin called ahead for reservations. Our table was ready minutes before our arrival and we were seated immediately. Unfortunately that's as good as it gets. Sometime after being seated our server came over and took our drink order. When she returned with coffee we wanted to say we were ready to order but didn't want to rush her. Big mistake. She never came back. She continued to wait on other tables around us  we finally informed the hostess that we were forgotten. Server then came over, no apology, but wait now she didn't have a pad to write down our order. Left, returned, took order. She came over for coffee refills but after that she was MIA. She'd slink by our table but wouldn't look at us nor did she come over to say I'm sorry, it's taking longer then expected or folks it'll be a few more minutes. So finally after an hour wait (yes, dumb on our part for even waiting), we called her over and asked how much longer? She gave us attitude. It's a 2 hour wait for food. Really? And you don't tell your customers that? She then said you should have called ahead (which we did - the no wait app) and told her so. She then said you can come back later or next week when it's not as busy. (There were a few empty tables). We told her we're leaving. Clearly she didn't give a care in the world that we were leaving. As a former server, it's quite clear that she's burned out, miserable and truly unhappy which equals \"time to find another job\". Let's all hope it's away from customers. Unfortunately I can't comment on the food since I never got any. However, worst service and server ever! Get rid of her  asap! I didn't get her name but we were there July 18, 10:30 am reservations. You don't seat folks if you don't have staff to wait on them. And especially if it's a 2 hour wait. Who the hell wants to sit and wait 2 hours for breakfast??? Never going back. Too many other options and places that want and appreciate your business. Which is exactly what we did. If I could, I'd give a negative 5 stars due to the service."}
{"text":"Went here last week on the Friday before New Year's. A wait for 3 people was only for a few minutes, so we lucked out there. Probably because most people's work places didn't decide to have New Year's Day observed on Friday instead of Monday like mine did. But it worked out!

None of us had ever been in before, and I suggested it once I remembered that it being a Friday, The Yard would not actually be serving brunch and I had to think of an alternative. I don't know how I heard of it, but the name sticks out! And friends were met.

Service was prompt and courteous. Coffee was really good, which is kind of rare for a breakfast place in my view. I also liked the tiny coffee cups that they served it in-it allowed me to actually finish a cup for once before they came around to refill it, (thus ending the constant adjusting of cream and sugar ratio to each cup.)

I got the Breakfast Magic specialty waffle...which I was really confused about when I ordered. I thought it was just an egg breakfast? (I dunno. I read the menu really, really wrong.) and was confused but not upset when I got waffles WITH an egg on top. It also explains the befuddled look I got from our server when I asked if it came with toast or anything. (No. The answer is no, waffles do not generally also come with toast, Kate, you carbivore.)

It was really good! A plain waffle topped with bacon,cheddar cheese and green onion with an egg (cooked your way) on top. Really yummy, but I didn't see any of the toppings cooked into the waffle as advertised, just on top. Shrug. It was good and filling. The aforementioned toast was unnecessary.

Solid 4 stars. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Waffles INCaffenated is my new favorite breakfast joint on the South Side.  I had the Benny (their take on eggs Benedict), with a side of bacon and potatoes.  This was my first ever savory waffle and it was completely awesome.  The tender, crispy and slightly sweet waffle, underneath the poached egg, with the tasty H sauce all worked together nicely.

Now, I'm never ga-ga about anyone's potatoes, but the recos on Yelp were not wrong.  I got a little square bowl of chopped and fried potatoes of nearly every color: purple, yellow, sweet little orange bits...  all perfectly (and surprisingly) well-seasoned!

That brings me to one final observation:  there are no condiments on the tables.  None.  I didn't even notice until I was licking my fingers in delight.  A breakfast restaurant that knows how to season food - that's what's up.

I'll can't wait to try some of the other menu items, but for now I'm stuffed.  Oh, BTW:  you'll notice I said nothing about the bacon.  It wasn't worth a mention.  It's $3 for three very ordinary slices.  Skip that.  Get the potatoes!"}
{"text":"We went out here for breakfast the other day and had a great time! We ordered a savory waffle and a meat omelet with chicken sausage and ham. Both were delicious. The atmosphere was delightful. The staff was great as well. My only issue was the time it took for the food to be ready. When we were there, there was not many people in the restaurant, but our food took about 40 min to reach the table. I was unsure as to why, but everyone makes mistakes. The food was great so that made up for the service. I would highly recommend this breakfast nook!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to going here for awhile. To be honest I wasn't impressed. Don't get me wrong it was a good waffle but most are. I like all the options. The wait staff was very kind. I feel they were a bit light handed with the toppings. And $12 for a waffle that didn't impress was a bummer. My friend got a savory waffle with avocado and egg, and the avocado was less than fresh. I got the megaberry. I will say a sub for the whipped cream with the cheesecake spread was a solid decision. Maybe I'll give them another chance eventually could have been an off day."}
{"text":"Cool little breakfast/brunch (or more specifically waffle and omelette) spot in South Side. Decor is nice, but feels a little trendy which always makes me nervous - too many places focus just on a trendy theme and not the food. Fortunately Waffles Inc isn't one of those places.

I had the \"Benny\" which is Eggs Benedict on top of a waffle with a BIG juicy slide of ham and sprinkled with (real!) crab meat. This may sound like an odd combo but it actually works really well!

Service was very friendly and super fast, will definitely return when I can!"}
{"text":"Overall I was really pleased.  

Things that gave it four stars:
-Original, delicious menu
-Array of choices
-Friendly staff
-Cool environment
-Affordable prices
-1 free refill on all cafe drinks

Things that didn't give it five stars:
-Outrageous wait - and I'm not meaning for a table.  They told us 15 minutes when we got there, which was fine!  The 15 minutes went by quickly, and my friends and I had already looked at the menu and decided what we wanted before we sat down.  It took awhile to get our drink order taken and we immediately ordered our food because we had been waiting already over 10 minutes once sat.  We couldn't order the potatoes because they were out so we got it replaced with toast.... One single piece of toast to replace a side order of potatoes which really didn't please me but whatever beggars can't always be choosers.  But then after 25 minutes had gone by after working our waitress came over and said the food was taking awhile because they ran out of waffle batter.  RAN OUT OF WAFFLE BATTER.... AT A PLACE WITH WAFFLE IN THE NAME?   We shrugged it off because we were having a good time just chatting about our weekend and then I noticed we had been waiting over 40 minutes for our food!  The waitress did however address the problem and said she would talk to the manager about giving us a discount without us even asking.  

We spent almost two hours in there once we sat down.  We then had to remind the waitress that we needed our checks and she ran off after setting them down so we had to wave her down to get it actually paid.  I don't blame the waitress - it seemed as if they were just understaffed for the day.  Maybe they didn't anticipate memorial day being a busy morning or maybe I'm making excuses for them because the food was really good... Regardless I will go back and give it another shot.  The food was amazing, the atmosphere was cool, and the staff was overall friendly and nice.  But waiting over an hour for a waffle and omelet after a night out on the town can really put a cramp on your overall experience."}
{"text":"I'll put this on my list of never coming back to. 2nd time I tried it. 
Poached eggs poached in oil? Weird. I've had poached eggs at over 60+ breakfast places and never have I seen this. 
Crepes filled with marshmallow fluff (almost non-existent)! 
The waiter had to comment on everything we ordered, coffee we drank, water we drank. Here is a tip: just wait on people and don't comment on their every move."}
{"text":"I visited this place because of the ratings. Their menu was varied.  I tried a signature.waffle with berries.  First of all the waffle was not large enough for the prices paid. Secondly, it was not crispy, but soft and dough like inside.  

I can see it as a place to try once, but that is it."}
{"text":"Neat brunch spot. Very creative waffle combinations. The Funky Monkey Waffle is great for people with a sweet tooth...chocolate chip waffle topped with banana, fudge, and peanut butter."}
{"text":"Very good.
Would have given 5 stars if it was a little cleaner.
Food was awesome though."}
{"text":"It was just ok for me if you want something trendy and affordable this is ok it's on the south side restaurant strip and convenient to shopping it will cure a craving for a waffle !"}
{"text":"I ate here with my wife for Sunday brunch. We ended up going to north park in the morning and watched the wait time decrease on the yelp app from 45 minutes down to 0. That is a VERY useful feature!!! We were seated quickly and the inside is a little small and fairly packed in with tables. 

I'm not a huge sweet person for breakfast, but I do love chocolate chips in my pancakes and the funky monkey waffle sounded amazing! I ended up going with the chicken and waffles instead since this isn't too popular a dish in the Pittsburgh area. My wife and I shared a side of home fries as well. The waffle was huge and tasty; a great combination of sweet and savory together.  There were 4 large chicken strips on the waffle as well as scallions. I liked the vanilla syrup better than the maple and the home fries were good as well. My wife had half the berry waffle which looked great for a sweet tooth like hers. 

I liked my experience here. Prices are a little higher than what I typically would like to spend but the food quality is definitely there with some unique dishes. The unique part makes this a worthwhile stop if you are a fan of waffles!"}
{"text":"Meh....45 minute wait... 50 minutes for food.    Don't see the big deal.  Food was just decent.   Seems staff is run ragged.  Small coffee cups so refills are needed after three sips.  Tables stay dirty after people leave for 20+ minutes... No wonder such a wait!  Place is hot and unventilated.   Be prepared to smell like grease when you leave!"}
{"text":"Ate there last Saturday....it was good but not fantastic. I got the Benny which was fair....Hollandaise needed some lemon.  Portion was fair but on smaller side for price. Coffee fair and served with no spoon. Service was also fair. If invited I would go back however would not initiate visit. Double espresso served in Collins glass...really?"}
{"text":"Stopped by while driving through Pittsburg to ohio. Even though it is a waffle house I ordered the french toast. I like that they crisp the french toast by placing it in a waffle maker.  Good taste, not impressed with the special butter that came with it and it doesn't need brown sugar sprinkled on it either. I did enjoy the vanilla syrup. My glass of water had lipstick on it, so that was yucky. My husband got the blt and juice. His blt was small but he enjoyed it and his apple juice looked like green pee, lol. Overall it was okay."}
{"text":"I love this place. They make breakfast a fun and creative experience. The lattes are a must...creamy and served in a bowl shaped mug as any good latte should be. Also try their precious ranch dust on your eggs!  The service is always decent and the atmosphere is pretty laid back. 

The only complaint I ever have is that the ventilation is not the best so you leave smelling like a kitchen. But you can always sit outside and avoid the smell but still enjoy the great food!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Waffles Incaffeinated since they opened in Southside a little over a year ago. There is no denying the waffles are great. They have sweet, savory, and make your own. Offer 3 types of syrup with distinct flavors. They also offer omelets, sandwiches and some other items. I always leave on a full stomach. They have a very good atmosphere. 

Most issues with the restaurant are pretty normal for a good breakfast place on a weekend. The wait time for a table is usually about 30 minutes. It also is very crowded. It is not the largest space and they squeeze in most tables as possible. This is also a difficult place to go in a group larger than 4 because they really only have 1 table that can handle that many people.

My only real complaint is although the main dishes are reasonably priced and filling, sides are very expensive. If you decide to add bacon and potatoes you are suddenly at a $15 breakfast. Good thing is that you are so full you probably won't eat again until dinner. 

Even with these small issues, I love eating here and strongly suggest it."}
{"text":"Interior is a joke what is this a McDonald's. Can't tell you how the food is because I never got it. There was poop all over the toilet. All around 5 star."}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar for awhile now, so I'm happy to have had the chance to stop by during the week recently. On a Friday morning around 10ish, we breezed right in, but I can see why this place would be bonkers on the weekends...it's not terribly big on the inside. Definitely take advantage of the NoWait app if you're attempting to come here on a weekend.

Anyhow, waffles are obviously the name of the game here, and they try to elevate this humble breakfast carb with their gourmet offerings. My husband and I ordered two waffles (the Funky Monkey and the Chicken and Waffles) and went halvsies. 

The waffles were presented beautifully. The Funky Monkey was a decadent treat, a waffle spiked with chocolate chips, topped with bananas and a peanut butter chiffon, finished with chocolate syrup. The waffle itself was a bit soggy towards the middle (probably on account of the moisture from the chiffon, which was in the center), but it was appropriately crisp towards the outer edges. This is definitely the kind of heavy, sweet, carb-coma-inducing waffle that lowers expectations for what you'll be able to accomplish for the rest of the day. The chicken and waffles, by contrast, was a little more substantial. It was a pecan-infused waffle with three maple-butter glazed chicken tenders adorning the top, finished with scallions. I preferred this one to the Funky Monkey, as it was a great balance of sweet and savory. It could've used a little more salt though, and they were rather stingy with the amount of pecans in the waffle batter itself.

When you get down to brass tacks and remember that these are just humble waffles in fancy clothes, prices seem a little high (close to $10 per waffle). However, for some reason, that day the Funky Monkey was on special for $5 (not sure if it's a limited time special or this occurs every Friday), so that was a welcomed surprise. Service was excellent...we never saw the bottom of our water or coffee. Overall, we enjoyed our breakfast, and while I wouldn't make a special trip back here, I'd definitely return next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The wait was a half an hour long but well worth it. They don't have their liquor license so I was bummed that I couldn't get a bloody Mary. The waitstaff was great the food was great, no complaints at all"}
{"text":"Meh. Maybe waffle expectation is different for different people. I generally prefer more crunch on the outside with a tender inside. Mine was uniformly limp as though the iron was not as hot as it should have been. My dining companion's crepe may have been a little overcooked since it was a bit hard. The wait staff was excellent and attentive. The electronic software to manage the wait list for seating crashed while we were there so the tables were nearly empty even though arriving guests were told the wait would be an hour or so (Sunday morning). The tables quickly filled after the problem was fixed. My general impression is this is a very nice place for breakfast albeit a bit overhyped."}
{"text":"The waits are usually unreasonable and recently the wait staff has been less than remarkable. Despite this fact the food is delicious. They have the best waffles and their Eggs Benedict is to die for! Don't try the coffee though-- not the best. Overall I recommend using the No Wait App to get in line at your first thought of going, just to be safe then make your way out the door."}
{"text":"OK place for breakfast if you have lots of time to kill and don't mind waiting. Personally, I don't think the wait is worth it.  I've been here a number of times and long waits to be seated as well as getting your food 30 + minutes after ordering is pretty common, even on days that aren't so busy. This kind of wait would be fine for fine dining, but come on this is breakfast! On weekends, expect a super long wait for a table since it's a small restaurant restaurant and a very inefficient operation.

UPDATE: at the insistence of my SO, I gave this place another chance and had yet another frustrating experience.  I figured late morning on a weekday would be a safer bet and checked the NoWait app just before I got there which stated \"No wait, come on in\"  -  then arrived to find a number of people waiting ahead of us as well as a number of empty tables.  

Despite the app still saying that there was no wait, we waited for greater than 20 minutes to be seated then another 40 minutes after our order until the food arrived.  In the meantime I witnessed three obviously overworked servers who could not keep up, let alone update the NoWait app.  At one point nearly half the tables were either vacant or unbussed with several parties waiting to be seated. 

When the food finally arrived it was OK, but definitely not worth the wait. Their advertisement of a bottomless cup of coffee on the menu was a joke, not once did our server have a chance to come over to offer refills, nor had I expected him too since he was running around like a maniac the entire time we were there.

I'm not sure if the kitchen is not big enough to keep up with the orders or that the kitchen is as understaffed as the dining room. I can understand a call off here or there but given my previous visits as well as what others have reported on the site, my experience today seems to be the norm.

Needless to say, I am through with this place."}
{"text":"After almost stopping in for weeks, and seeing the intimidating line out the door, we finally made the plunge and were able to quickly get seated. That said, we were here at 830am. While sitting here we've see the line grow out the door.

We ordered the mushroom chèvre, a mushroom omelette, and a savory waffle, the breakfast magic--their supposed best seller. You'd think if they've made it so many times they've have the process down pat. The omelette... I have never in my life had so much grease sitting around an omelette, and it was egg whites! The best part of my plate was the home fries, which were multi colored and delicious. The breakfast magic was nothing but. When you see a photo on a menu, when they take time to add a photo to a menu... It's got to look somewhat like that photo!! The waffle wasn't anything special and the egg was kind of sad. and small.

Even though drinks were refilled quickly, the kitchen must have been very backed up because it took almost an hour to get our breakfast. I understand waiting at other places, but this is breakfast... More likely than not you should be in and out. I had to add more money to our car meter twice while we were here.

Also, there is only one bathroom but there has been a line almost the whole time we've been here.

Most importantly, WAY too loud for a breakfast spot -- acoustics are terrible and bounce the noise, and because the tables are so close together you hear other people's conversations word-for-word.

Generally, staff is friendly and quick to refill the small coffee cups. The waitress upon leaving did offer us a to go cup for our coffee, which was much appreciated and honestly the best part of our visit.

This place claims to be a great waffle experience in Pittsburgh, but it's closer to a Waffle House experience than most would like to admit. And you're overcharged for it."}
{"text":"First timer here, def enjoyed it! Love the set up and menu it's amazing what combos they have here for just waffles! All the food was quickly served and very fresh! We had a very nice server who was attentive to me as a newcomer to this place,"}
{"text":"This is probably the BEST place to get brunch. The customer service is very friendly. The atmosphere is awesome. Very nice place to go on a date or just hang out with friend and family. Highly recommend the eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant while visiting a friend who recently moved here. He said the food was amazing and that there was always a bit of a wait. Luckily this restaurant lets you put your name down on a waitlist online which is a huge plus! We were able to
sit outside which boded well as there is great people watching and the weather was pleasant and breezy. I got the make your own omelette with home fries and my boyfriend got the banana fosters waffle. The potatoes came in assorted colors and were perfectly seasoned with onions and peppers. Beautiful presentation on the plate! But I gotta say I enjoyed my boyfriend's waffle much more because it was so decedent and delicious. The candied walnuts and ice cream were a perfect combo to this waffle. I'm not sure if I could finish such a sweet entree but I had some good spoonfuls off his plate that did not disappoint. Overall, waffles are a must have but service was a little slow. It took our server around 15 minutes to get our check once we asked and we even had to run it inside to make sure he got it. Great place and would come back!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for a while. Nothing special. The menu is huge which I guess is a good thing, but it's a bit much. You can get almost anything on a waffle. I had bananas. It was ok. They have different syrups to try. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. Been there done that. Don't think we'd be back any time soon unfortunately."}
{"text":"Really good food, not too bad of wait on a Sunday morning
I had a omelet with was excellent and my boyfriend had a waffle that he added chocolate good, blue berries, caramel sauce and whipped cream. Tried the waffle and it was even better than the omelet"}
{"text":"Funky monkey included chocolate, bananas, and peanut butter. A taste of heaven! Food and service were excellent!! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Husband found this place, so we decided to try it out on our way home from a weekend in the city. Definitely use the NoWait app if you go on a weekend or else you can have up to a two hour wait. 
Husband had Breakfast Magic. He said that it was good, but egg was quite small, and it could've used more sauce. 
Daughter and I shared the Funky Monkey. It was very good. The peanut butter topping was delicious. Could've used some more chocolate sauce, but we made up for that by using some of their syrup. Also had bacon, and it was delicious!
Son had Fosters waffle, and it was amazing! I think it was the best order at the table. It was like dessert for breakfast since it was topped with ice cream and cinnamon. 
Wait staff was friendly and efficient. 
It was good food, and it was a fun new place to visit."}
{"text":"Such a cute spot for breakfast/lunch! I had the Country Benedict and it was bombbbb! The house made gravy is amazing with chunks of sausage, which I thought was unique and tasty. The atmosphere was chill and all around I loved it. Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Hipster waffles are great.  so many different choices.  I got a vanilla bean latte there it was probably the best drink I ever had.  I just wish they were open a little bit later."}
{"text":"Go here.  This is one of the best artisan restaurants in Pittsburgh, and is perfect for a weekend brunch.  If you like seafood (shellfish), I highly recommend the Caprese Crab omelette.

Also, there is no TV or loud music to distract from the social side of the meal."}
{"text":"O.M.G. 
This place is Amazing. Their side potatoes and side mushrooms were perfection. I ordered their banana foster waffle and it was everything you could wish for. I can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"This place was great! The presentation of the dishes is amazing - very well put together. 

I got the sausage gravy covered waffles with a side of bacon and roasted tomatoes. It was all amazing. The only thing that was unexpected was the roasted tomatoes are served cold. I expected them to be warm. This wasn't a bad thing, and I'm not sure if that's common, it was just unexpected. The coffee was great as well. The interior is very modern and pleasing to the eye, I will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Looking for a different breakfast option? This place is for you! Being only the 4th review, I will give you the rundahn! 
Pros: food is excellent! The breakfast magic that I had was savory and fresh! My wife had the blueberry waffle and it was delicious. Waitress Nikkie was friendly and informative. This confirms the first three reviews on friendly service!!

Now the cons (sorry, there are a couple .. keeps it from a 5star affair) As the 1st review stated, the coffee mugs are too small. We asked our server a lot for \"more coffee\".
A suggestion would be to either get larger mugs OR get coffee carafes and leave them on the table (a la Perkins)
Second comment (which was also stated by another reviewer) was the smell when walking in. My guess is a little more exhaust ventilation. 

Final Answer: great place to go!!!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed. Staff was rude and making fun of customers while standing in front of the host table. Classy. Our server Mike was a gem though. The chairs they have out by the host booth were absolutely filthy and stained. Disgusting. Long wait and subpar food. I did like that the home fries had a variety of potato types, but that's about it. I wanted to love this place but left extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Was just as \"average\" as Beavers version.  Dry chicken and drier waffles.  Like they were sitting out for hours.....

Maybe if you soak them in ice cream, but not for the savory Customer.  Very dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"Finding a good brunch place on Christmas Eve can be a struggle. I was with a party of 6 and to our delight, Waffles Incaffeinated was open for business and sat us right away! 

The inside is a bit cramped but considering the size of the restaurant, they make the most of the space and I ain't hatin' on that! I was happy to discover that they offer a variety of coffee beverages. I asked for a decaf soy latte but they were out of decaf espresso :( I ordered decaf coffee instead but our waitress brought me a side of soy milk to use instead of half & half! Win! Our table ordered omelets, chicken and waffles, MTO waffles (gluten free and regular) and a side of breakfast potatoes. My thoughts:

Amazing: The menu variety. The food choices to mix into the waffle batter and/or add to the top is extensive. Take time to choose, it's worth it! Savory or sweet options, galore! Three types of syrup, too! Regular maple, Bourbon infused maple and Vanilla (real vanilla bean infused inside of the bottle) BONUS: Gluten free waffles! No sacrifice in taste or consistency!
 
Great: The Omelets and the MTO omelet option. A topping option is a huge portion of fresh avocado. Try it with a crab & veggie omelet *salivates* Also, breakfast potatoes that are a mix of sweet potato, blue potato and regular with peppers and onions. Enough said.

Just fine: The coffee. Maybe the espresso options have a better kick but I found the taste of the plain coffee just okay. I had to add the vanilla syrup with my soy milk to give it solid flavor.

Eh: The price. Specifically, the add on prices and cost to eat gluten free. You won't find diner prices here! For the price of a full meal, there are brunch spots with AYCE deals around the city that include an adult bevy! I'll reserve this joint for special occasions. 

Less than eh: Service time. I get it, brunch is a busy time. But, it's no secret. We waited almost 45 min for our food. Our waitress was great and very apologetic. She refilled our coffee multiple times and was very attentive throughout the entire meal. No compensation for the wait or an apology from management. Not a deal breaker but it's nice to know that the management is communicating with the staff and aware of issues such as major food delays! 

All in all: 3.5/5. I'll return on occasion."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Magic is well, magic. Their chicken & waffles is my favorite- the sausage gravy is the B E S T. Or maybe their potatoes are ? They have good coffee (black) but if you're fortunate enough to have Heather (the most efficient/friendly server out there), order yourself a latte. You won't be disappointed ! 

I also like that this location is BYOB. (:"}
{"text":"I checked in with the NoWait app, which has recently partnered with Yelp, but when we got there, the hostess reported that it hadn't registered me as checked in. Frustrating, but he sat us within 8-10 minutes of coming here, and was very friendly and accommodating about it. We ordered the caprese crab omelette and toast as well as a cinnamon waffle with whipped cream. Both were decently satisfying, and the maple syrup felt delightfully light in comparison to most store bought syrups. However, the portion size of the omelette was quite small, and we thought it would be larger since my father and I were sharing it. Overall, welcoming place, a cool little waffle joint. I'll have to come back to review it again!"}
{"text":"The sunny interior matched the service with a smile. Quality ingredients like wild mushrooms, berries, & greens. Decent options for non-waffle aficionados. I savored the mushroom chevre omelet and salad topped with a zingy dressing. The focus was on freshness rather than greasy and gut busting. The smaller portion sizes were a breath of fresh air-- a satisfying breakfast need not make you feel like a bloated glutton. A definite new  favorite Sunday brunch place!!!!"}
{"text":"The chunky monkey was good but the orange crepe was terrible. The sweet orange was so over powering."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for brunch while visiting Pittsburgh for the weekend.  Love the concept! The wait was about 30 min, which wasn't bad for a Sunday morning! Our table ordered the Breakfast Magic, the Funky Monkey, and the Benny. All were delicious! My favorite was the Benny and the kid's favorite was the Funky Monkey, of course. Service was good, although a coffee refill would've been appreciated.  They also had some yummy looking omelettes, so it seems there's something here for everyone. If we're ever in Pittsburgh again, I wouldn't mind revisiting this place!"}
{"text":"Best brunch in Pittsburgh! I ordered the Megaberry waffle with a side of chicken.. DELICIOUS. The home fries I would highly recommend. I'd pass on the ice coffee but no complaints otherwise. Great service! Kelsey was awesome and fast."}
{"text":"I went crazy with my make my own crepe and had a chocolate chip and bacon crepe with caramel sauce! Talk about delicious!! They have great service and the coffee was superb. We will definitely be back for our big breakfast fix again!"}
{"text":"I will never understand how this place continually produces the worst wait times for breakfast in the area. 

I've been to most breakfast places in the city, Pam's, DeLuca's, Kelly O's. Somehow these places have seemed to master the very predictable rush of guests from 830-1230 on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Waffles Inc, not so much. 

How you only have two waiters for the restaurant is beyond me. How it takes 50 minutes to prepare and omelette and a waffle is beyond me. 

How this place gets a 4 star review again, is beyond me.

My waffle came out soggy, chicken was cold. I've been to this place 3-4 times based on proximity, and consistent great reviews - I figured maybe I just caught it at a bad time. 

Nope. This place will not see me again. Terrible service, terrible wait time, and over priced, over rated breakfast."}
{"text":"Very long wait (almost an hour despite empty tables throughout the restaurant) and mediocre food. Service was slow but not because of the server (she was dynamite); there just weren't enough servers for the crowd. We selected the \"make your own waffles\" and waited 30+ minutes for them to get to the table. They weren't very hot which was a bummer. Omelet was ok. Got the meat lovers. They don't skimp on the meat. But again, it wasn't anything to write home about. 

Great place for kids to go sugar crazy happy with all the waffle toppings and mix ins. Just be prepared for a wait."}
{"text":"Very good breakfasts. The waffles are defiantly good. Was kind of annoyed when I went that they were out of 2 beverages I asked for - and one was decaf coffee"}
{"text":"My waffle was SO GOOD! I had the Breakfast Magic waffle and added fried chicken. The coffee was tasty, but could have been stronger. The staff was friendly and was able to put us into the No Wait system with a phone call as they don't accept parties large than 4 via the app. There was a long wait (about an hour), but that's to be expected at a breakfast/brunch place on a Sunday at 10:30-11:00. It was well worth it. Everyone in our party was very pleased with their breakfast."}
{"text":"This was my favorite place for breakfast. However today, I ordered the benny. It was ice cold. I asked for my bacon crispy, but it was also cold and limp. The potatoes were good, but cold.  My friend told the waitress she doesn't like oniond but the dish she suggested was filled with them. And cold. Our dishes shoulda been warm.  I have had better meals for less at dennys"}
{"text":"Yum! We came here for breakfast this morning and it really hit the spot. There are plenty of places to sit, the service was quick and the food was delicious. Huz ordered a 'make your own omelette' and I had the pancakes. I feel silly for not ordering waffles, but there's always next time!"}
{"text":"The waffles , coffee, tea, and all other accessories were well done and unique.  Im not sure it was worth the long wait and most likely wont go back. When I see the servers with purple hair and tattoos its usually a clue to turn around and go elsewhere . In this case they were on the ball and hustling  all the time."}
{"text":"Every time I go here the food is phenomenal. I have never had a dish that disappointed me. From savory to sweet they have it all! I always use the Nowait app and never have a problem getting seated."}
{"text":"We arrived and stood in line to my surprise for about only 10 minutes. We were given a little slip of paper saying the wait for food usually lasts a while since everything is made to order, which was a nice heads up and made the wait less of a surprise. I ordered the foster waffle and my boyfriend ordered the waffle with the egg on top (can't remember the name). Both waffles were good! I had to order a side of eggs and bacon too so that I would be full though. It wasn't bad and the waffes were good, I just don't know if I would go back right away (I like a lot of protein in my breakfast). If you're looking for something sweet though for a breakfast/brunch spot, this is your place. They have a lot of omelets I didn't get the chance to try though, definitely give those a go."}
{"text":"I went to Waffles INCaffeinated yesterday (Sunday) for brunch. My party included four adults, and two toddlers (in high chairs).  We used the \"no wait\" app to put our name in around 10:25am and received a table at about 11:10am. The app makes the whole process easier, however if you show up early, or don't use it at all, there is NO WHERE to wait inside.  Plan to wait in your car, or outside.   We waited several minutes for our drink order to be placed and about 15 more minutes to place our food order. We finally received our food around 12:30pm.  That was entirely too long to wait.  When our order finally arrived, everything was correct, but we were all so hungry and cranky that no one cared what the food tasted like by that point.  Someone needs to go in and evaluate the whole operation, otherwise they won't be around long. Also, small minor side note - the \"kids menu\" is not served in a kid friendly way. They don't have kids cups or plates.  Imagine toddlers trying to use ceramic dishes and coffee cups for their beverage."}
{"text":"Yum!!! I knew this place was going to be good because who doesn't like waffles? And if we're being honest... they're pretty hard to mess up. 

With that being said, Waffles Incaffeinated raised the bar for waffles moving forward. They took a waffle and used it as a blank canvas. 

I had the Chicken and Waffle and oh my gosh. The chicken was BOMB. So crispy and had the best flavor. I used the Bourbon syrup and it paired perfectly. 

My boyfriend created his own - it was basically dessert because it had cheesecake, ice cream, chocolate sauce, etc. Definitely really good if you like sweets. 

I would definitely like to come back. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here to use a living social deal. Was expecting that there would be a bunch of restrictions based on some of the other reviews but turned out it was a breeze to use the deal. Got myself a breakfast magic waffle. The waffle was a bit softer than I'd normally like but there was plenty of bacon, cheddar, and onion flavor so it was still pretty tasty. Portion size was very generous and their bourbon maple syrup was good too. Would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Honestly...This place has the longest wait for tables and food.....And it was worth it. Our waitress was awesome and eager!! Harley was the main reason we will be back. She kept the coffee flowing and had the best attitude. This review could have gone either way and her service was worth the 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. We had the Funky Monkey and the Mushroom omelet, with added crab meat. The service was excellent, quick and pleasant!"}
{"text":"Run don't walk to eat here!!!  I LOVE breakfast food and this is one if my new favorite places to go.  There was a short wait to be seated on a typical Monday morning. Once we were seated and ordered the waiter told us it would be a bit of a wait for our food because they were so slammed. I appreciated the fact he was honest. But let me say that the food was worth the wait. I ordered the Very Berry waffles and my son ordered the Breakfast Magic. We shared. I think we inhaled them. LOL. The Berry waffles were packed with berries, had berries on too, and coveted with a mountain of whipped cream. You really don't need syrup but IF you think you need some I would suggest the Vanilla. As for the Breakfast Magic-it comes out looking just like the photo. The perfect bite is waffle, plus, a tiny but of sour cream with a bit of the Bourbon Maple syrup. Too die for!  We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is hands-down amazing! I got a hot alpine berry tea and the Megaberry waffles- they were so fluffy, the fruit was ripe, and the vanilla syrup and whipped cream just made them perfect. My boyfriend ordered the Breakfast Magic and completely cleaned his plate- it was fabulous. Friendly & fast service, comfortable seating, and a fun, welcoming atmosphere. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Not very impressed.   The menu is a lot to take in. The waffles were more like dessests so we ordered a plain waffle,  it was light and fluffy,  very good.  I tried the Southwestern omlet, my friend made his own omlet,  both omlets were on the small side for the price. Unfortunately the hash browns we ordered were not ready so we had to wait for them while we ate our omlets. Eventually the hash browns arrived in a large bowl,  they were good for being deep friied.  The coffee cups are too small. The presentation was very nice. For a breakfast place we waited a long time for our breakfast and they were not busy at the time. It's on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Ive been wanting to try this place since I moved to Southside. My cousin and I stopped in here today for brunch. I ordered a ice chai tea and the chicken and waffles. The iced chai was more creamer or milk than it was tea. Then when my waffles came out it looked really good asthetically but they were not something I would order again. The chicken tenders were really dry and hard to eat and the waffle itself was ok but you cant really mess up a waffle. I like the flavor of the maple syrups but I wasnt a fan at how watery they were. When me and my cousin got our checks they dicounted her food which was odd because we didnt send anything back or complain at all. Overall the food was pretty cheap I would maybe come back to try something else and give it a second chance."}
{"text":"To start, I am not a breakfast person, and I am not wild about waffles. I do like bacon. A lot. But that's about it. This place, however, is bombastic. I came here this past weekend with my visiting mother and my boyfriend. I ordered a waffle with chocolate chips mixed in and fresh blueberries and whipped cream on top. They offer 3 different syrups: maple, bourbon, and vanilla. I went with the maple. The bourbon had too strong of a bourbon taste for me and the vanilla was just alright. My bf got some type of southern-style breakfast waffle thing. I can't even remember what all was on it, but it looked delicious. They both ordered a side of home fries and, let me tell you, they were the most delicious home fries I have ever had.

So the food gets 5 stars, but so does the service! Our waitress was very friendly and on top of her game. The music playing was a mix of jazz and funk, which was pretty cool. What made it awesome was the kitchen staff singing rather loudly in the back. You would think something like that would annoy you, but it just added to the experience for us. My mom loved it and nearly choked on her Coke from laughing (she was laughing with you guys, not at you, I promise! :D).

Inexpensive and very delicious. 5 stars, go visit now! And bring me a waffle."}
{"text":"The food was good. I had the funky monkey waffle and my friend had the florentine crepes. Both were very tasty and had a very beautiful presentation. My gripes come from other aspects of the resturant. The air conditioner was broken. We sat there in 80 degree sweaty heat as we ate a hot breakfast. It was hard to enjoy the food because the air was so stagnant and hot. They also seemed to have an over abundance of small flys swarming  around the resturant. They got a bit annoying buzzing around our face and down right discussing when they landed on my waffle!!! Rrrrrrr. I was a bit annoyed at that point. The place is a great concept and prices are good. Just wish I had a better first experience. Probably wont be back again."}
{"text":"A very berry explosion encased in the most delightful light and fluffy waffle. So yum...so yum that I can't stop thinking about my waffle from yesterday morning. 

Rachel C knows good breakfast, so I wasn't surprised that she suggested Waffles INCaffeinated being that the Yelp reviews are pretty stellar overall. The name is cute and catchy, the decor is modern and simple, the service is exceptionally friendly and educated, and the waffles...are spectacular. 

I plowed through my Megaberry Waffle with speed and efficiency, but still noting that the fresh raspberries and blueberries were stuffed into just about every bite. Plus, said berries were perfectly paired with a dollop of whipped cream and a splash of the housemade vanilla syrup. And it didn't hurt that the crispy bacon provided a perfect yang to the yin I was experiencing with the sweet (but not overly so) waffle I was shoveling. 

Portions are nicely sized but not mammoth, so if you enjoy the waffle as much as I did, don't expect to share."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new place today . This establishment is run very poorly . From the moment I stepped into the restaurant until I left I was very unhappy . The greeting at the door was very unfriendly . The waitress took awhile to get our drink orders and seemed bothered to take care of us . Once the food came it was ok but the atmosphere just made me want to hurry up and get out of here . This is not a place I would put on my favorite list too pricey for the less than acceptable service . I won't return not worth the aggravation ."}
{"text":"Had the Country Benedict which was delicious.  Waitress was great as well. My date had the breakfast magic and she really enjoyed it as well.  I cant believe I've lived in Pittsburgh my whole life and never tried this place.  If looking for something different give it a try you will enjoy it!!!"}
{"text":"I don't normally like waffles - but I ate my meal to the last bite. There's a good mix of savory which I enjoy. Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"I created my own omelette with spinach, bacon, sausage, and onions. It was soooo good! And the potatoes on the side were killer. they were a mix of sweet, purple, and typical potatoes cooked with peppers and onions. These potatoes are one of my top picks for breakfast potatoes that I've ever had. 

My boyfriend ordered the sausage gravy waffles and he loved them! I tried a bite and the gravy was flavorful and meaty. The waffles were fluffy and perfect. 100% will be going back to this place in the future!"}
{"text":"Another great experience at WI. I love the fact you can check in with the No Wait app, limits the amount of time you have to wait for a table. Tried 2 new waffles, the December monthly special Fig waffle and the Country Benedict. Loved them both. Just an fyi the military discount here is 10% every day and 40% when in uniform!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this establishment garners such love and great reviews. Yes, they do offer waffles in any configuration imaginable (and some not so imaginable). But the lack of quality is evident from the waffle to the bacon to even the watery syrup that makes one consider consuming their food without it. There is zero decor or ambiance so this is certainly not a date spot for brunch. It's more like a Waffle House minus parking, or food made with a semblance of passion."}
{"text":"Disappointed in my Waffle. After my third cup of coffee my waffle arrived. It was obviously sitting under some sort of warmer while they made my wife's food. I waited so long for my waffle I didn't have time to send it back. I ate less than half and didn't want to eat any more cold waffle. The waitress finally came by and asked if I wanted a box. I told her no because the waffle was cold out of gate. She didn't offer a resolution. She actually said if she had made it it would have been perfect! The place wasn't overly busy. Plenty of tables. Not sure why my food was cold. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I love the food and that's saying a lot since I'm not a wild fan of waffles. The only issue is the staff. During our visit the place was swamped so it's okay that we had to wait. However, once we were seated, our waitress kept complaining about the hostesses and other waitresses. I mean, I've worked in food myself long enough to know the complaints, but hide them from the guests."}
{"text":"I love the waffles and coffee here! I've gotten the souther, sausage gravy, breakfast magic, and I've made my own. They all were amazing and filling. Will certainly get the funky monkey one of these days. It gets busy and sometimes takes awhile for food so had to only give 4 stars."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I tried this place!!

My friends and I used the NoWait app and that definitely helped us with conveniently waiting for a table-- I recommend using NoWait when dining in for brunch on the weekend. We arrived during prime time, there was a bit of a wait between being seated and our server greeting us at our table but we understood why with how busy the restaurant was during that time. 

The restaurant is BYOB, Rhiannon greeted us and instinctively asked if we wanted OJ after seeing we brought champagne. 

After placing our orders, the food came out extremely fast! We ordered the Souther' Waffle, the Funky Monkey, and the Sacre Bleu-Berry (French toast). We were all super satisfied with our food! Next time we are back, I'm planning on ordering a second egg on the Souther' Waffle to add a little more \"sauce\" to the Waffle. 

Looking forward to next time! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Service was questionable as our server kept forgetting what we wanted  (came back because he forgot the drink order after 10 seconds..and the drink was water). Lemon poppyseed waffle was incredible! Gorgeous presentation with an edible flower. Blackberry syrup,  fresh blackberries, vanilla ice cream and lemon cream cheese. The vegetable/vegetarian omelet is also amazing. Home fries are all different types of potatoes and are different colors (white, purple, orange) so the plate is beautiful :) not to mention the amazing spicy mayo on the omelet itself, which was filled with roasted tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, onions, and feta cheese. I will definitely be returning here with my next out of town guests!"}
{"text":"A pretty significant wait on a Saturday around brunch, but since they take reservations just call ahead.  

The food was good and was skillfully / artfully presented.  Very pleasing to the eye.  My only critique--and this could have just been me / a fluke--is that my Funky Monkey (one of their most popular dishes) was served to me ...warm... As if it had been sitting around for a while.  Granted, I was in a decently large group and they could have been waiting for other dishes to finish before bringing it out, but for something so wonderfully put together, I would expect it to be served in such a manner too.

This hiccup didn't stop me from giving the place a 5/5 stars.  

Eat up!

Oh, and P.S. The cappuccino with Bourbon flavor shot is Devine--in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"We came here Saturday morning hoping to use a LivingSocial deal; sadly they couldn't accept it on the weekends but we stayed anyway because dang it I am not one to leave a delicious-smelling, bottomless-cup-of-coffee-serving establishment.  The waffles were fantastic (I had Breakfast Magic and the other person had the sausage gravy waffles) and our server, Jeremy, was friendly and very attentive.

Only downfall that I noticed was a slight fly \"problem.\"  I hesitate to say \"problem\" as there was only a gnat floating around us, it wasn't like a swarm or anything.  I get it, there's syrup, fruit, doors opening, etc, and impossible to control it entirely, but if other Yelpers noted it too......#justsayin

We got here a bit before 10:30 on a Saturday with no wait.  A few minutes after we were seated, there was a line waiting.  While there were people waiting, the tables seemed to remain un-seated after they were cleaned for longer than I'd expect.  Our service was great, though, so all I can say is I'd suggest you come early!


Bottom line: great waffles, try the bourbon syrup, ask for Jeremy, and get here early."}
{"text":"We love Waffles INC!  We frequented the original in New Brighton years ago and so pleased to see the shops grow all over the Pittsburgh area.  They have great service, pleasant atmosphere and the food is outstanding!  Congrats on your recent opening in Wexford!"}
{"text":"How do you know a place is good? When you haven't even finished your first meal and you're already planning your next visit! This was my first visit ever to a Waffles INCaffeinated, and I got to enjoy it with a rather large party on a Saturday afternoon. The manager was very helpful and accommodating!

Now, for the food. My faith in humanity and homefries has been restored! (It's so easy to screw up potato, and it takes talent to make them taste amazing.) The epic homefries feature a mixture of a variety of potatoes - white, sweet, blue/purple, as well as green peppers and onions. Everything was extremely well seasoned (any more and it might be too salty), and the crispness of the potatoes was amazing. It was like eating cubed french fries or slightly more solid tater tots. Seriously, five stars for these little starches!!!

Waffles, because well...they're all about the waffles. I was a bit overwhelmed by the sheer variety of toppings, and had a plan going into my meal. The in-restaurant menu had more pre-made options than what was online, and greatly helped my decision process. I opted for the Sacre-Bleu-berry (blueberry waffle, peach cream cheese in the middle, and more fresh blueberries on top.) To mine, I added raspberries because all those fruits together sounded delicious, and oh yes it was! The syrup options on the table were a vanilla bean syrup (simple syrup with vanilla bean highlights), and traditional syrup. I tried both syrups, and felt the vanilla bean was perfect with just a hint of sweetness.

Also, the coffee was coffee. If it's available, try a little vanilla syrup in it with your meal!

I look forward to going back and trying some of the savory options like the waffle with in-house made sausage gravy and some of the chorizo waffles."}
{"text":"Did you ever take a bite of your dish and think to yourself, I can't imagine how they could even improve on this?? Well I did  just that at Waffles INcaffeinated this morning because I was completely blown away by their Waffle-Copia.  My daughter ordered it too and she was raving right there with me!

The Waffle-Copia was a special that I hadn't even intended to order until I saw the specials flyer - I had it down to 3 choices before we sat down because their regular menu is loaded with killer choices. But when you're offering up an apple & fig compote over a sweet potato waffle infused with cranberries and candied walnuts with a pumpkin cream glaze how could I not??? One taste let me know I'd made a stellar decision. The sweet potato waffle was the best ever & there were enough of those delightful figs for every bite. 

My daughter-in- law's Fosters waffles with bananas, walnuts & ice cream were amazing. Hubby's spicy Souther' was crazy good, especially after he added the Bourbon Maple Syrup to it. I'd order a plain waffle and drown it in that syrup with a huge smile on my face. The coffee was a yummy dark roast, which we loved.

We all made comments that their plates were so big they wouldn't fit in any if our dishwashers so be prepared to leave with a full belly! You might even consider wearing your sweatpants here just to be safe. 

We've been looking forward to trying this restaurant for a while thanks to our Yelp buddies and I'm soooo glad we did!"}
{"text":"What a welcome addition to Wexford! Literally located in the plaza in front of North Allegheny High School and open at 8am for Breakfast/Brunch. When we searched for Brunch places to take our visiting out of town daughter last night & discovered this now existed, all 3 of us said, 'Done!' We've been to the Southside location before & this one pretty much replicated the great food in a slightly larger space with a bit more elbow room, so it's a win. 

My husband and daughter both got The Chunky Monkey Waffles with bananas, peanut butter and chocolate. There were loads of happy sounds from both of them across the table. I ordered The Souther' Waffles with chorizo, jalapeños, cheddar cheese, salsa and cilantro. Absolutely delicious with a nice kick of heat. My husband finished my last waffle section on my plate & also raved. Adding their Bourbon Maple Syrup to both our dishes was fabulous. 

Portions are large and quite filling and there's always a special waffle each month that your server will describe. Our service was great, coffee cups were always filled with piping hot coffee and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So good! Mega berry is incredible, coffee is delicious, and the options are endless on this great menu. Staff was really friendly and responsive. Excellent place to grab some breakfast if you're near Carson!"}
{"text":"My first time at Waffles Incaffeinated was amazing. It's my new favorite breakfast place, and I would recommend anyone to come here! I got here around 9:15am, and we were seated immediately. Come the 10:00am/10:30am hour, there was a line of people waiting to be seated. 

The food was fabulous and affordable. I got the Funky Monkey with bourbon vanilla ice cream with vanilla syrup, and my friend got the Florentine crepes. I highly recommend both. The crepes are nice because the savory inside filling (chicken, mushroom, spinach) compliments the sweetness of the waffle batter. The crepe itself is quite thick, almost like a very thin pancake (very flour-y). This plate could easily feed 3 people, as they served 3 rolls of crepes. It looked like a hot mess, because it comes with field greens tossed in a vinaigrette on top. It's not picture pretty, but it is so. darn. good. My friend and I split the Funky Monkey, and I also ordered a scoop of bourbon vanilla ice cream to go on top (is there any other way to eat waffles? For breakfast?...) Sadly, they were out of the Java, coffee flavored ice cream, but the bourbon vanilla was a good choice too. It complimented all the flavors of the waffle. It comes with a creamy dollop of peanut butter, a portion of a Hershey's chocolate bar, and sliced bananas (probably 1 whole or 3/4 of a banana). The presentation was thoughtful and fun. 

All in all, love the huge, typical American high-caloric, Diabetes-inducing portions :-) Service was great; never saw the bottom of my coffee mug as the waitress was always around asking if we needed more, and the interior design is full of modern, clean lines, and bold colors. I would come here every weekend if I could."}
{"text":"I come here a lot because their waffles are so amazing. They have so many different choices for both sweet and savory.  You can also choose your own toppings and create your own.

Their potatoes are my favorite side and I've heard their omelets are great too!  Service isn't always great, I've spent well over an hour there before because the server hardly ever came by our table."}
{"text":"Used the no wait app, which cut back on us standing around outside since the waiting area is VERY tiny. Small place, many different selections of waffles. I chose the French toast, and it was very good. Everyone in our party enjoyed the food. Good service, we would come back again."}
{"text":"Had a very nice breakfast here on Saturday!

This restaurant was very busy. It has a diner feel with it's exposed kitchen and quick service. But the interior is more modern. It appeared to be kid friendly, since it was packed with families with babies and toddlers. High traffic and lots of children led to some messy floors. But overall, it was clean and I found it to be adorable inside. 

The menu had options from savory to sweet....

I ordered the breakfast tacos and a caramel latte (with whipped cream of course). Both were delicious! The latte was wonderful and beautifully presented. The tacos were composed of fresh ingredients and the fresh squeezed lime gave each taco the perfect flavor. In the top 3 for best breakfast tacos I've ever had. (If you follow my reviews you know my love for breakfast tacos!!)

I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my preferred style o' cuisine here: funky, inventive and doesn't quite make sense until you put it in your mouth. Savory waffles are my JAM. Their benny (a spin on a traditional eggs benedict with crab) was absolutely delicious ($8.5). We got the monthly waffle special- Waffle Rancheros ($8.95)- chorizo, rancheros sauce, sour cream, green onions. We also couldn't resist the sweet potato fries ($4) with marshmallow fluff jerk sauce. 

Tip: get a latte or cappuccino! they have one FREE refill! 

It was PACKED on a Sunday but what else can you expect? Service was great! The host obliged my request for some coffee while we waited.

Why only 4 stars? Hmmm... it hurts a little bit to pay $9 for a waffle with no sides."}
{"text":"While we were in town to see the pirates and my boyfriend had looked up some places and wanted to hit up Waffles Incaffeinated. We showed up and there was a line out the door. Perhaps we should have called first. We put our names in, gave our phone number and were told it would probably be an hour wait. My boyfriend really wanted to go here, so we said fine.

We wandered around the area (found Big Dog), and while we were sitting and lounging, only a half hour into our wait, we got a text from Waffles Incaffeinated that our table was ready and to text back if we were coming - very efficient system if you ask me. 

We walked back, and were seated and our server, while she was crazy busy came over almost immediately. My boyfriend chose the chicken and waffles with vanilla syrup (I think he should have gone with bourbon maple, but that's just me). I went with make your own omelet, and basically did the Caprese Crab, without the crab. I really liked the tri-colored home fries that came with it, and they were well seasoned. My omelet was super fluffy. My boyfriend enjoyed his chicken and waffles - a favorite of his. I would have liked the orange juice to be fresh squeezed. I mean for $3.75 for an 8 oz glass, I kind of expect it? 

The thing my boyfriend was not pleased about was the buser came over and asked if I was finished with my plate, and I said yes, and he took my plate AND my boyfriend's plate, despite that fact that my boyfriend was still working on the last few bites of food. Like pulled the plate away as my boyfriend was still eating the last few morsels of food. Not really a fan of that. But, the food was good, and I would still recommend for breakfast, just call ahead."}
{"text":"I give this place five stars for the value and the quality of the breakfast.  All the waffles on the menu looked really good - I could not chose between sweet - the funky monkey, the berry one or doing savory - waffles benedict, waffles and gravy or the one with the cheese, bacon and fried egg on top.  So I created my own concoction of waffle with bacon and peanut butter chips, topped with peanut butter fluff and sliced banana.  It was really good - I didn't even need syrup but I did try a little  of the bourbon maple which was not overly bourbon flavored.  I also got scrambled eggs that were cooked well and the waitress was nice and never let the coffee cup go empty.  I hope to go back to this place to try out new fun concoctions with the all mix-in's and toppings to chose from."}
{"text":"Waffles Incaffeinated is so unhealthy, but oh so tasty. The crown jewel of this place is, in my opinion, the white chocolate latte which is like biting into a creamy bar of white chocolate. So far, my boyfriend and I have tried the berry waffle, the funky monkey and the savory breakfast one and the savory waffle is definitely the best. I really liked the funky monkey, but the sugar rush was just too much to handle. I've noticed that they are generous with toppings on the sweet waffles, but skimp on the savory ones, so keep that in mind when ordering! I know it isn't a waffle, but I am a huge fan of the carnivore oh-my-lette (that's an omelet, in case you are wondering) and found it delicious and jam packed with meat and cheese. The breakfast potatoes that everyone seems to like so much are good, but not super amazing since they are unevenly crisped (some bits are soggy both times I've had them). Overall, Waffles Incaffeinated is a real treat if you have a hangover or are craving a greasy breakfast, but be prepared to be leisurely about your experience as there is often a wait and service is spotty. Everyone I've encountered working there is nice, but somehow we always get forgotten (especially when waiting for takeout, which can take 30-40 minutes on a weekend) and I have to ask for water/the check, etc.. Great spot, but has some room for improvement. I can make a better waffle (if we're just talking about the base) and not have to wait ages for it. The flavored syrups are a nice touch, but have an odd consistency so I stick with the classic maple syrup."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this place, but it was such a let down. We waited 45 minutes after we ordered to get our food. Way, way, way too long.  It wasn't even that busy.

3/4 of us at the table ordered the chicken and waffles which sounded amazing... such a let down.  The chicken was so over-cooked it was practically inedible. Waffle was good though. While we were waiting for a table, after the fact, I remembered seeing someone who ordered the chicken and waffles, had eaten the whole waffle and cut up and left the chicken when they were sone. His must have been over done, too.

The other person at the table got sausage gravy (was good but bland), toast, and tri-colored home fries (liked very much). He liked those food items, but after waiting so long it was hardly worth it.  Different flavored syrups were good.

Dear Waffles, please reevaluate the way you cook your chicken and I may think about coming back.  If I wasn't so hungry I would have sent it back and got something different.

Maybe it was an off day, for the food AND service, but this is what happened when we were here. :("}
{"text":"Everything is awesome!! Get there as early as you can if you want to have breakfast at the weekend, the waiting line is really long. Over all is great, the waffles and omelettes are my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We got the chicken and waffles, the sausage and gravy, and the veggie omelet. Everything was so delicious! They have 3 different syrups: vanilla bean, bourbon barrel, and regular. They are all to die for!"}
{"text":"Do you like dope-ass waffles? Because this place has some dope-ass waffles. There was a bit of a wait, but that's probably just because a lot of people wanted to get their faces into some dope-ass waffles. The coffee is pretty good too, but the real attraction here is the dope-ass waffles."}
{"text":"first time in Pittsburgh & first time at this spot. It came highly recommended & totally lived up to the rep. We did a call ahead and were seated in 15 min for our party of 5 during peak brunch time. Service was great & food was bombdotcom. Breakfast Tacos were a HIT (+avocado & side of potatoes ), along with the chicken & waffles with the sausage gravy & Foster's waffle. Would DEFINITELY visit again!!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. We litterly had to wait 2 hours for a table when we were told it would be a 1 hour wait. Then they kept making excuses as to why they couldn't sit 8 people together. We saw plenty of parties of 6 that came and went and they had such a hard time sitting 8? On the plus side, our waiter was nice and accommodating and got our orders (mostly) correct so they redeemed themselves."}
{"text":"If i could give less than one star i would. They got the worst service ever. Not to mention, the food is really bad. The potato fries are cold and very salty everytime.   I came in couple days ago. I waited over 25 min to get seated desipte a table was open outside. Finally a couple walked in ask for a table and joe the manager decides to offer them the table and ignore me. How would that make you feel."}
{"text":"I am not a waffle or sweets-for-breakfast person 99% of the time. So I knew I was going to be looking to other parts of the Waffles INC menu to find my breakfast. There were actually quite a few non-waffle-y choices, though most of them were on the heavy side (think eggs benedict, monte cristos, etc.) and I really needed something that wasn't going to sit in my belly like a lead weight all day long. I ended up creating my own omelet with ham, cheddar and pico de gallo on the side. The omelet was just the right size and had the perfect amount of ham and cheese - not too much and not too little. 

Our server was sweet and went out of her way to make sure we were happy. I tried a bite of Rachel C's coconut and berry waffles but they didn't really do anything for me. I would have preferred a little bit of a crunch but these were on the doughy, soft side of the waffle spectrum. 

Cute restaurant and a fun, if a little bit kitschy, concept. Give them a shot and decide for yourself!"}
{"text":"This is not a hoax. Waffles INC. has opened a second restaurant in South Side where a Cold Stone Creamery once stood, proclaiming victory for independent businesses over chains. I had a feeling Pittsburgh was due for one of our own, and I hope that the move brings owners Tahj, Josh, Cassandra, and Gordon much success and acclaim. 

And unlike my review of the New Brighton spot, I have absolutely zero complaints about this Waffles INCaffeinated, as minor as those gripes were (I still gave 'em a 4/5). For example...

1-No slippery glass table tops could be found here (Josh, whom we spoke with after our brunch, wants to replace the tables at the one in New Brighton). The wide-open dining room (New Brighton's is a little small)  is cozily colored turtle green with black accents and even has soft, plush, yellow chairs in front. This is one for the decor dictators. I challenge them to find an issue here. 

2- Waffles INC. has obviously tweaked and thus perfected their potato salad.  This time, the baby potatoes that populated the salad itself were tender without being overboiled, and that dressing, which contained expertly diced and contrastingly crunchy scallions and red bell peppers, was tangy and creamy and rich and thus was miles better than that served by Winghart's (see yesterday's diatribe on that...err... joint). As a raving potato salad fanatic and missionary (eat more tater salad, children of the earth!), I was pleased. 

3-Nothing was forgotten, and the service was cheery, sociable, and effectual -- a COMPLETELY different experience from the fiasco at Winghart's just 24 hours before. Anna, you rock!

The waffles had the very same light, airy quality that I expected, but when I also had the savory waffles as opposed to simply saving them for dessert (for those not in the know, Waffles INC. also has crepes, sandwiches, omelets, and other things on their menu besides waffles) I was amazed at how nothing was lost in the translation. My duo of Eggs Benedict waffles each played the part of an English Muffin, replacing crunch with pillowy chew. Underneath the perfectly supple poached eggs that bled sunshine when lacerated (Jacque Pepin would approve) was a fat, charred, juicy slice of ham, and o'er top of it all was very REAL crabmeat (are you reading Grant Bar?) as well as the most winning hollandaise sauce I've ever eaten in a Pittsburgh restaurant. Fatty, lemony, and arriving at just the right consistency between thick and runny, someone in Pittsburgh finally hit the target...or must have called my mother for her recipe -- THIS was hollandaise sauce. 

Kay ordered something I probably would not have ordered for myself and therefore would never know how delectable it can be. Hers was a Sausage and Gravy Waffle, a.k.a. Shit On A Shingle. At least two of the owners are veterans, so it shouldn't shock anyone that this would be in the menu. What's shocking is how fantastic it was. That spongy waffle soaked up the savorous gravy while the crumbled pork sausage was as saliferous and decadent as homemade corned beef hash. And what. A. Plating (pictures are coming). It was akin to stepping out of the cafeteria and into the 5 star hotel. 

For dessert, Kay and I ganged up on the Funky Monkey Waffle. Mammoth enough to serve a quartet, we barely lasted against it. A ball of peanut butter chiffon (peanut butter is folded into whipped cream to keep the peanut butter from being too rich according to Josh) topped a waffle that is segmented four ways and is also garnished with chocolate sauce, banana slices (holy Elvis!), and a Hershey's chocolate bar for added opulence. I'd been making peanut butter banana sandwiches for myself for years (with bread and Eggo waffles) ever since my aunt (an Elvis fan) introduced me to the concept, but I never thought a chef would take it and turn it into something so epic and epicurean. A towering monument of triumph constructed to pay tribute to the gods of confections, we worshiped at its base. That mighty waffle, studded with chocolate chips, was merely a platform for all that sugar can be.

Our collective hunger was annihilated by Waffles INCaffeinated. The snowdome that is South Side has been shaken once again. I predict that Waffles INC. will blow up. Big.

P.S. Despite only having opened just under a week ago, the number of glitches encountered by us was nil. Waffles INC. has got their mojo in perfect workin' order."}
{"text":"Great brunch choice in Pittsburgh area!! The wait can get long, but you can plan ahead and check in through yelp!"}
{"text":"The GF and I had just flow in for a 4th of July weekend in Pittsburgh. We stopped by our friend's place in Southside and decided to grab some brunch before exploring what the Steel City had to offer.

He recommended Waffles Incaffeinated and judging by the long wait, it's a popular place. We played some pool nearby and got a text an hour and a half later once our table was ready. Luckily, once seated, the food came out fairly quickly. 

Mushroom Chevre O-My-Lette [$8.95]
Fresh goat cheese, tender wild mushrooms  

The GF went with the goat cheese and mushroom omelet, which was perfectly cooked and had earthy mushrooms interspersed throughout. Plenty of salty goat cheese topped the omelet, with a roasted tomato slice on the side. A nice variety of fresh fruit was provided as well.

Breakfast Magic [$8.65]
Crisp bacon, shredded cheddar, green onion, egg, sour cream, bourbon maple syrup

I went with the breakfast magic, with an over easy egg. Cute Pac-Man arrangement, but frankly I would have enjoyed the extra quarter wedge since for me, this was a small portion. Some home fries seemed warranted and would have been proportionate to the price.

Still, the meaty bits of bacon, the sharp cheddar, and the bite of the green onions balanced nicely with the light, yet somewhat crisp waffle. Do ask for the bourbon maple syrup, which brought some additional sweetness to each bite, with an undertone of the whiskey.

Overall, Waffles Incaffeinated satiated my appetite for a few hours and paved the way for me to go to Primanti Brothers shortly thereafter. I can see why it's a neighborhood favorite as it features fresh, well-executed breakfast dishes."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast! I ordered both sweet and savory waffles and they both turned out nice. Good sizes for sharing. But the restaurant is a little dirty. Will come back some day if I come to Pittsburgh again"}
{"text":"Wife and I were in Pittsburgh looking for a house to buy.
We decided to stop in at Waffles Inccaffeinated do to the great Yelp reviews.
I had 3 eggs over easy with bacon and home fries and white toast.
Th eggs were cooked perfect and the bacon delicious,
I did not like the home fries at all they were a combo of a bunch of different potatoes and not what I would consider home fries at all.
The service was excellent and the waitress gave us fast and friendly service.
I do not think I would go back again for eggs, But the waffles looked really good and might go back to try them.
I thought the prices to be on the expensive side more than most places as breakfast for two was 30.00 with tip??"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch for the first time.  Ordered the chicken and waffles.  Was surprisingly well done, the waffle was light and crispy with pecans mixed into the batter, the fried chicken was thickly breaded and very tasty.  You get three chicken strips.  Nice combination and a good choice I would get again!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for such a long time, and unfortunately I think the food was just okay. The staff was excellent and a manager even took the time to go over the menu with us. As far as the side dishes, I was thoroughly impressed with their fruit bowl and with their breakfast potatoes! The waffles themselves tasted very good, but I don't think waffles hold their heat very well so unfortunately most of our meals were lukewarm or cold. I don't know if I would've minded this so much if I had ordered one of their sweet waffles, but eating cold bacon and eggs isn't exactly ideal."}
{"text":"Had to knock a few stars off. It's been a year since I last went, but since I was back in the Burgh for Thanksgiving holidays, I decided I had to return to get more delish waffles with my mom this time. 

We decided to go on my birthday this year, and it wasn't really crowded since it was a Monday afternoon. It took a while for someone to just bring us menus and drinks. A harbinger of things to come.... 

We finally placed our order. And then we waited. And waited. And waited some more. A lot of time passed. And I was starving, mind you. Same with my mom and BF. We were all hungry asf! 

Finally, totally fed up with the poor service, my mom walked over to the counter and asked wtf was going on. Apparently they totally forgotten to put our order in. And NO server came by to check up on us. It was a massive disappointment, plus my mom had to go outside and keep putting money in the parking meter thing because we had to wait so long. Really unacceptable. Kind of a shitty way to kick off one's birthday. But oh well.

They apologized, yes, and they brought us food. But that was it. No offers to even comp even the orange juice or give us some type of coupon for a second visit after making us wait for over an hour. Maybe they assumed we wouldn't bother to come back after such shitty service. But believe it or not, my mom was totally in love with the waffles, so she wants to go back, but it probably won't be for another year or so. I just hope that if we do return, the service is better and they don't have 1 person waiting on the entire restaurant, busy or not, and that they actually remember to put in our orders....grr. 

I wanted to give 2 stars or less, but I agree, the waffles did come out perfectly delicious, so that was their saving grace in my book."}
{"text":"Popular Southside breakfast spot for good reason.  I had the Country Benedict & the quality of the ingredients shown thru.  Chicken was expertly fried, homemade chunky sausage gravy.  Portion size was perfect.  Will most def return."}
{"text":"The best breakfast spot ever! You can have omelettes and waffles made any way that you want them and it's f*n delicious. Big portions (for the take home)...I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I met a friend for a mid-monday lunch.  Breakfast was the food of choice since it was his birthday!  I have never been a big waffles person.  (No to pancakes too)  But - being that I was at a waffle place - I felt like it was inevitable that I get waffles.

IF i am going to eat waffles - I like them with some crunch.  My megaberry waffles - while beautiful was relatively soggy.  I know it had some reduction on it - that helped with the \"soggieness\"  but the outside could have still had a bit of crunch - right?  Maybe that's just my preference.

While I didn't finish my waffles - I did finish the scrumptious berries!  My friend got the Chicken and waffles and devoured it. 

They were not busy - granted it was a Monday.  I can see it being packed on the weekendds.  The service was great.   I would definitely go back - but go for their non-waffle selection next time ;)"}
{"text":"This is by far the best breakfast place in Pittsburgh. They have sweet and savory dishes to suit everybody. The service is great, I love the way they take your name for the waiting list and give folks waiting coffee. Most people have already left compliments for the funky monkey waffle, which is the best tasting waffle ever but I really love the potatoes. 
The only thing this place could improve on is the size of the coffee cups. I always feel bad for the servers that so by 3 or 4 times to refill our cups. But not so bad that I stop drinking."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The portions are generous and the food is amazing.  The chicken and waffles may be my favorite, but everything I've had has been very good.  I don't normally like 'breakfast potatoes', but they take it to a whole new level and I love them!  For the latte drinkers, their signature latte is amazing, hot or cold!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but probably the worst service I have ever had in my life it took 1 hour to bring me my food which was an omelette. I will never go back."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful but no matter if the place is empty or full, it should not take 45 mins to cook and serve breakfast fare.  Either they send staff home earlier than they should while they can not handle the workload full staff, or they have managed to make waffles into a 45 min item.  Either way I feel like they push slow to new levels and make me question my future patronage"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Waffles Inc. I had to come back to try the waffles this time. Even though I ordered a carb loaded, paleo nightmare, it was worth every single solitary bite.  

I went balls to the wall and ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of potatoes. Not a fruit or a veggie in sight, but sometimes you just have to go there, you know?  The potatoes were a medley of purple, orange, red, and white potatoes that I think were roasted. If they were fried they weren't greasy at all. They were perfectly seasoned with a hint of onion and green pepper that didn't over power the potato taste. -I think there were parsnips in there too. D-fricken-lish.

The waffle?  Holy sh*t. It was plated with a sprinkle of scallions and 3-4 breaded/fried chicken tenders that were drizzled with a sweet maply syrup, but it didn't make the breading soggy. The waffle was absolutely perfect. It was a toasty brown color on the outside and was soft and bready inside. I had to stop and observe a moment of silence for all the people with gluten intolerance who will never be able to indulge in the goodness. ********amen********

Every couple bites surprise you with a sweet pecan. (I think they were pecans-might have been walnuts. I may not know nuts, but i know they added great flavor.  The waffle was so good I didn't even put butter on it. 

The server offered three different kinds of syrup, vanilla, bourbon, or maple. He recommended the maple, and it did not disappoint.  

The wait was over an hour, but I didn't mind it. If you go on a weekend, you will wait, but don't be a jerk about it. Plan ahead and enjoy a great meal. I can't wait to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple, the Sunday manager of this place has no idea, concern, care, or respect for the patrons of the owner of this establishment.  We drove 30 minutes to go to this place on Sunday with an out of town guest used the app no-wait, were sixth in line when we got there, waited 10 minutes to get up to the desk, and were turned away because we had signed up for waffles incaffeinated downtown and not south side.  Actually the downtown one is really in Wexford.   The mgr basically told us to go blank ourselves and he doesn't care, if we want to eat we are at bottom of list!  He will not move us up under any condition.  We left, had a great breakfast at Bartram and will NEVER return to this or any waffles incaffeinated restaurants.  Customer service??  This mgr has no clue!  

Received a note from Waffles...totally do not understand the issue.  Yes, we misunderstood downtown Pittsburgh for Carson St.   However, by your response, we are obviously not the first people to have this happen.  The real problem is your and your management team failing to recognize what true customer service is.  Your manager offered to put us at the BOTTOM of the list!  We had no time for that, there was no effort to expedite us or assist us in any way, he didn't care if we stayed or left!
Sadly, after looking at all of your negative reviews on yelp and other sites, way too many for my comfort, I believe you did us a favor."}
{"text":"Loved going to Waffles Incaffeinated this weekend with the family. It was quite busy but we were able to put our name in the list via the NoWait app  and we were sat right away! 

Our waitress, Rhiannon (I hope I spelled that correctly), was AMAZING. She was funny, helpful, and really made sure our experience was enjoyable. 

I got the Benny waffle. It was really good except that the waffle was very buttery. Next time I go, I will make sure to order it with the vegan waffle instead. My brother and his girlfriend also loved their waffles (they live in the area so they are there all the time). They suggested we get the breakfast potatoes as well and I am very happy for it. Those potatoes were delicious. 

If you are looking for good food and a nice atmosphere, I definitely suggest going here. The only thing keeping this place from being 5 stars is that we were seated right next to the bathroom and there was not a great deal of space for people to get by our table."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly in this beautiful, well lit dining area! The funky monkey was delicious because of its creamy peanut butter topping and bananas. The omelet was superb and went well with the sweetness from the waffle. They gave coffee refills and are very friendly! Love this place."}
{"text":"Great value. Decor is cool. Service was decent but food came out slow, 40 min. Half options are nice for kids. Ordered breakfast magic with jalapenos, monte cristo and the funky monkey. Everything was great. It just wasnt hot. Kinda seemed like our server was more concerned with getting cut. Bill was 26 with tip. Also, just a thought, when someone orders juice and water the juice should be brought out with the meal."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. Went today with my daughter. I had the vegetarian omelette with the tri color potatoes.  The potatoes were crispy and tasty.  And roasted tomato was a big surprise too.  My daughter had the chicken and waffles she loved it.  So many flavors going on with that dish too.  Just wished their prices weren't so high. But you do pay for those trendy places with good food!  Wishing them continued success!!!"}
{"text":"Without even the extra embellishments, the waffle itself is awesome. I could probably eat 3 in one sitting with the maple-bourbon syrup they have. However if you do opt for toppings they have the classic berry waffles, chicken and waffles and an assortment of desert waffles. My mouth is watering typing this review thinking about the waffles.

I opted to create my own waffle because I'm vegetarian and I wanted something savory. I got a sourdough waffle with cheddar cheese mixed in and topped with avocado, green onion and a fried egg. It was delishhhhhhhhh. Ugh waffles"}
{"text":"Great food, nice service, simple menu.  My only complaint was that the side order of eggs was small, but everything else was big.   Definitely making this a common stop for breakfast."}
{"text":"What an absolute disappointment. Clever name , friendly staff ...but way overpriced  for breakfast items. Coffee was warm, not hot. With this being the coldest day of the season so far who wants to drink warm coffee. The food seemed lost on the plate with no imagination whatsoever on how to plate chicken & waffles...again, not into warm food. The syrup is way too thinned down, it made the waffles mush and was way too sweet. I regret paying $25 plus tax and tip @$32 for the food and drink portion but appreciated the wait staff.  Come on business owners and kitchen staff, appreciate the customers walking through your doors and accepting the prices by providing to us an ultimate experience."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. The chicken and waffles was an awesome new take on a usually heavy dish. The potatoes were crisp and flavorful. The waffles with berries on them were heavy but I'm just not a big fan of so much berry syrup on a waffle. Otherwise great find, will be back."}
{"text":"My hubby really wanted to try the waffles so one blustery and gray Pittsburgh Saturday we decided to go and try. I have wanted to try WI for a while now and just didn't get there so now that they are so close, makes it very easy. I checked the no wait app and there was no wait. Onward we went. There was a line but there was a huge party waiting to be seated. It took a few minutes but it was not bad and once we got to the host stand we were immediately seated. I have to say, unfortunately our waitress was not good. She walked back and fourth a few times before bringing our coffee. Making excuses. Then she brought the wrong meal for my husband blaming the kitchen. Never asked my hubby if he needed a water refill. Then she brought the check and did not even ask if dessert was in our future. Thankfully the food was great (the only reason this gets a 4and not a 5, our waitress). The waffles light and fluffy and the toppings we got were wow, just wow! And there are so many choices. I chose the chicken and waffles. I didn't even need syrup on it. The waffle with its pecans, light and fluffy. The fried chicken tenders on top were sweet, tender, and a little crispy. The hubby chose the sausage gravy and waffles, double portion which didn't look like a double but who are we. But the sausage gravy was seasoned wonderfully with nice big  chunks of sausage. Overall, the food is delicious. Our waitress was not good. But I would and we will certainly go back."}
{"text":"As a recommendation of a friend, I decided to check this place out. I arrived on Sunday at 10 AM and the restaurant was already busy! I ordered the funky monkey. It took approximately 45 minutes for it to come, which in my opinion is way too long for a waffle. I was expecting a more crunchy-on-the-outside-and-fluffy-on-the-inside waffle, like a Belgian waffle, but it was plain like the waffles served in my dining hall. Not my favorite consistency. In general I would say that the experience was just okay. The wait was too long and the fire alarm went off for five minutes and the staff didn't do anything. I might go back, but not in the near future."}
{"text":"I'm an egg person for brunch, so while the choice to come to this place did not appeal to me, it would definitely appeal to those who love their sweets and whipped cream!

Coffee was ordered all around, and our party of four placed orders for the benedict, gyro, berry waffle, and a customized omelet of ham, cheddar, and mushrooms.

And then we waited. One cup of coffee down (add a shot of gingerbread....so good!), a Yelp check-in, and a few checks on the Facebook feed later, and we were still waiting.

And we kept waiting! The place was busy, but our eyes were jealous seeing plates go to other tables. And we were starving. This was not helping. Guess we'll talk about how hungry we are!

30 minutes went by, and we finally got our meals. While others enjoyed their meal, I was slightly disappointed. My eggs benedict with crab sounded awesome on the menu, and I was expecting some sides or just a mountain of poached eggs over two large waffles. My dish was half the size I was expecting! I left hungry, and I was pretty sad. And waiting for the check took some time, too.

I will say that the berry waffle looked pretty amazing, so if you're willing to wait, I'd come here. I was just way too hungry to wait 30 minutes. You could get an oil change, an express mani or pedi, or write several Yelp reviews in that amount of time!"}
{"text":"Waitress was nice enough, but the wait for our table was 45 minutes and wait for our food was almost an hour (party of only 3 people). Waffles were good, but mine was missing the icecream I ordered.. I pointed this out to the person who dropped the food off AND the waitress, it still took almost 20 minutes (and a 3rd request) for anyone to bring it. Maybe service would be better on a week day, but on a busy Saturday service seems to lack. Still, the food is delicious.. Highly recommend their flavored lattes!"}
{"text":"A step above your typical breakfast place. Friendly staff, quick and attentive service, despite being continuously busy. So many choices on the menu, it's hard to decide. But when at a place with Waffles in the title, of course that's where I've got to go. I had the Funky Monkey - a chocolate, banana and peanut butter explosion. Pretty good, although waffle could have been a little crisper on the outside for my liking. Add a side of scrambled eggs (for protein, of course!) cooked perfectly, and a coffee cup our waitress never let get more than half empty. I'll be back for sure, next time to build my own omelette."}
{"text":"On the weekends you need to get here early b/c after 9:30 the wait is LONG. But, if you're lucky enough to go out for breakie on a weekday, well great for you! 

The Funky Monkey is killah! You don't need syrup, it's sweet, but not too rich, filling, but I didn't feel stuffed. I've also had their eggs benny, which being served on a waffle is a fun twist. 

My husband had the chicken and waffles and was not impressed. We'd come back for sure, if we're up early enough on a weekend. I'm interested in trying the caprese crab omelet and the megaberry waffle. The service is very courteous, but damn, that wait can be a nightmare."}
{"text":"The fact that the hostess didn't bother looking up from the desk, or say hi, and never made eye contact didn't bode well.
The waiter didn't introduce himself, just took and brought my water, and the check.
The server at the next table was very friendly, announced the specials, made recommendations.
I ordered the Mushroom omelet, made with fresh goat cheese. After waiting 15 minutes or so, I left. There were only 6 tables seated, 4 of which were waiting for food. I was the first of those 4."}
{"text":"The food was really good, but the service was a bit off... the wait was TOO long and they had given away my daughters meal to another customer.   I would go back, just know you are going to wait about 20 minutes for the food..."}
{"text":"I've died and gone to waffle heaven here! They tell you ahead of time that there will be a wait for your food as they don't have microwaves, but the waffles are well worth the wait. If you love waffles, go here because they amazing and the waffles come in different ways! I got the benny, which is traditional eggs Benedict on a waffle instead of an English muffin and they add crab in top. I definitely recommend this because it was absolutely delicious. The souther' waffle also tasted amazing. The waffles are so soft. Also the eggs come with pepper seasoned on top in case you don't want that. The staff are great and very attentive to come around and refill your coffee and water. I will be bribing everyone here!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the service was really good! My friends and I really enjoying going here for brunch. It's always super busy but worth the wait. My one friend is from out of town and whenever she comes to visit she insists we on going here because it's that good. The south side location is very tight that's the only downfall. I was between the French toast and a Waffle and decided on the French toast but when it came it was pretty much both French toast and a Waffle in one, it was so delicious!! They also have really good lattes!"}
{"text":"Welcome to South Side! Fantastic! I had sausage gravy and home fries. Wow! Sis. Had funky monkey(?).great? Niece had the Benny .love it! We all had pumpkin. Spice lattes excellant. Those home fries are incredible!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Even though it was a small place and busy, we didn't have to wait very long (thanks to the No Wait ap). The coffee was great and they had a busgirl come by and fill people's cups whenever they were near empty. Which was key because the cups were really small. 

I got the eggs benny which comes on half a waffle with ham and crab meat. I asked for the waffle to be crispy, but i felt like it still could have been cooked a little more \"burnt.\" It was still good, though. And even though it was small it was still filling. 

My wife got the BC breakfast, with egg whites, a double order of fruit, blueberry toast, and a salad. Her egg whites were a little runny in the middle, but she didn't have the opportunity to send them back because our waitress never came by to ask how everything was. Also, I don't think the double fruit was really two orders. Maybe 1.5 at most. The blueberry toast was exciting and different, but lacked flavor. 

We may go back, but wouldn't make a special trip to do so."}
{"text":"This place is OK. Went with a couple of friends. Everything on the menu sounds delicious. My issue is mostly with the speed of service. We waited 35 mins to be sat, which was to be expected and didn't bother us. However, once we were seated we were given drinks and then basically abandoned. It was 30 minutes before we were able to order. Then the longest part of the waiting... 40 minutes for our food (all waffles). Which even then, wouldn't have been so bad if we didn't have to watch as other parties who were seated after us get fed within 12 mins of placing their order. 
I got the southern waffle and added avocado. The batter they are using is great. The waffle was light and spongy and tasted fresh. The portion sizes are small. I don't know how every one else feels, but when I think of eating a waffle, I think of being full with yummy syrupy fluffy goodness for a good portion of the day. My check ended up being over $12 for just a waffle (not including tip) and I unfortunately, left the place still hungry. I really expected to love this place, but it just didn't happen.


Ps. The owner might want to look into exhaust (installing or repairing) fans above the kitchen area... our entire party left the place smelling like old grease. Blechhhh."}
{"text":"Whereas Pamela's is too crowded and Waffallonia serves exclusively dessert, I'm always on the lookout for new waffle places in the 'burg. Waffles Inc. definitely satisfies. 

I forget what it's called, but my current favorite is a waffle topped with eggs benedict, crab meat, and hollandaise sauce. The service is excellent, too - there were three ladies handling the shop when boyfriend and I came for breakfast, and they were over the top in terms of friendliness and constant (free) refills."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday at 10am.  Only four tables there, but jammed us all in the same little corner.  A little privacy would have been nice.  Service was nice and fast though.  Food was warm and properly prepared.  Had the breakfast magic and a side of mushrooms.  The mushrooms were good, but sides are expensive and everything is a la cart here, making a full breakfast possibly $20.  The waffle was good but not great.  Nothing stood out about it.  Anyone with a waffle maker at home could make the same or better.  The best thing is the bourbon syrup, now that is amazing stuff!  Overall the food was good, not great, but I would come back.  Presentation and decor are good.  I think my biggest complaint is that the place is very hipster and I can not stand hipsters.  Everyone who works there is a hipster and half the patrons are hipsters."}
{"text":"First of all, the wait can get very long especially if your party is more than two people. Thank God they are available on the NoWait app. Me and my friends got mega berries, funky monkey, southwest omelet, and chicken and waffles. We got these to share so we can try everything. They're all so delicious! My personal favorite is chicken and waffles, it's perfect amount of sweet and savory. The chicken is very crispy just the way I like it. GET IT, you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good waffle? Yelp makes it easy to join the waitlist, and on a weekend it's probably a good idea. It was hard for me to order anything other than the chicken and waffles (that bourbon syrup though...don't get me started!) after getting it my first time here, but unbelievably the breakfast magic was just as good!"}
{"text":"This place was about a 10 min walk from our hotel. You can get on the wait list through Yelp. I didn't really think anything of it at the time. We left the hotel and it was a 15 minute wait. When we got there, it was a 45 minute wait. I highly recommend you getting on the waitlist before going. 

They have a variety of waffles and other breakfast items. Husband got the megaberry waffles. I got the chicken and waffles. His was so good with all the fruit on it. The chicken was just tenders, but some of the best I've ate. Kind of sweet and savory at the same time. I'd definitely would be back, but get on the wait list."}
{"text":"Came here today for brunch with my sister who was visiting from out of town and my hubby. 

We had about a 15 minute wait for a table and once we were seated it took another few minutes for our waitress to come over for our drink order.  

During the wait we were able to decide on our food and gave our whole order at once.  

Our drinks were brought out promptly and remained filled throughout the meal.  

We ordered the breakfast magic waffle, the souther' waffle, and the peachy keen waffle as well as an order of the sweet potato waffle fries with a side of the marshmallow fluff jerk seasoning dipping sauce. 

The waffles and fries took a while to come out, but each plate that came out of the kitchen looked delicious.  When the waffles came out my egg on the souther' waffle was under cooked and the order had to be remade, but was handled quickly. 

The waffle fries were perfectly crisp and not greasy at all.  The dipping sauce was a perfect sweet counterpart to the fries. 

The breakfast magic waffle was chockfull of delicious bacon!  I loved it.  The peachy keen was delicious, but was even better when their homemade vanilla syrup was added to it!  Once the souther' waffle returned it was delicious! My husband even preffered it to his breakfast magic!  

I will definietly return and can't wait to try the rest of the waffles!"}
{"text":"I don't like waffles. Never have. I think they're boring. They're usually dry and no fun. Pancakes are where it's at for me. You can dress them up or play it down, but either way, they're usually delicious. But gosh darnit, Waffles INcaffeinated has got it going on!

I wanted to try them, considering I'd heard all this great buzz. In comes the bright, shiny new store right in the South Side. Lucky for us, we now have a city version of their eatery. Lucky for me, because now I'm addicted.

I didn't realize there could be so many waffle combinations. I honestly thought it would just be waffles with some fancy fruit on top or baked inside. But it's so not. It's pages of waffle inspired dishes! Savory waffles and sweet waffles, waffle sandwiches and so much more!I opted for the Eggs Benedict. Number 1, it's my fave breakfast dish and, number 2, I REALLY wanted the sweet waffles, but opted for a savory one (next time, my friends!). 

It was incredible! It had a lump of crab meat that was mixed with this tart, perhaps lemon (?) mix, on top of one of the best hollandaise sauces I've ever had (sweet). And the crowning achievement? The waffle itself! It was everything I THOUGHT a waffle should have been, but I'd never experienced before. The batter mix that created this square piece of magic was superb. It was sweet and fluffy, with no burnt spots to be seen. It was pure perfection.

I'm gonna have to fight the voices in my head each time I drive down Carson (to the gym right past the shop, no less!!!!) that tell me to stop in. But for you, don't wait, but run there!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, Little tables and coffee cups aren't the ideal, but food was great!!!"}
{"text":"I'm in love. 

I was staying in the Carson Street Commons when I stumbled onto this place. After yelping it, I figured I'd try it out and the place totally lives up the hype. 

It's small, but comfortable. The service was quick and there was no delay in getting the food to the table. The Eggs Benedict waffles were amazing. 

One thing to notice though, Yelp says they open at 6am. Nope.  I went on Friday morning at 6am, closed. Walked back at 7am, still closed.... They open at 8am. Also, be aware that they get a hella line!! 

I drove by it on Sunday morning and there was a line wrapped up on the sidewalk for a couple hours!! 

I'm actually bummed that there is no Waffles INCaffeinated in San Francisco!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chunky monkey with bourbon maple syrup. It was really good. The peanut butter and chocolate toppings reminds you of a Reese's peanut butter cup. The bananas further enhances the sweet ensemble. Despite this, I do not think the one waffle is worth $10. They do have a $5 discount on Fridays, which would make this more worthwhile."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I experienced the glory of Melt in St. Louis (YOU NEED TO GO THERE) prior to Waffles Incaffeinated. I had so many expectations and Waffles Inc. could not compare. 

With the word WAFFLES in the restaurant name, I was expecting tons of prebuilt sweet and savory waffles options. The selection was disappointing and while they were totally accommodating to my veggie needs, they had zero prebuilt savory veggie options. Because of the small waffle selection, they have a ton of other food options like crêpes and breakfast sandwiches. But I went to Waffles Inc. for a waffle. Duh. 

Despite the lack of waffles, the food was delicious. I ordered the Breakfast Magic without bacon. I cleaned my plate. I will be visiting again with different expectations and an open-mind. Not a \"this place will be like Melt\" mindset, because that simply cannot happen."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Eggs Benedict was not so great. The berry waffle was the best but still mediocre"}
{"text":"I love their breakfast I can eat there forever if you haven't notice by now I love food and them waffles are on point.  I never knew Pittsburgh have really good eating places. We need more drink places but overall I love it."}
{"text":"The place was only good, but perhaps a bit overhyped.  We got the Funky Monkey and the southern Waffle. 

Funky Monkey: came out beautiful looking, however in the end it was a regular waffle topped with bananas, a peanut butter concoction and chocolate sauce.  Points for concept, but taste wise could have been easily replicated at home or elsewhere

Souther' waffle: gets more points for taste. There were pieces of sausage and green onion mixed into the waffle batter, which made for a nice surprise every few bites. Pico de galo topping was fresh as well. 

Overall, for a standard 1-1.5 hour wait on weekend brunch, I probably wouldn't go back. Neither of the dishes we had were great enough to say, ill come back just for THAT."}
{"text":"This is truly a one-of-a-kind breakfast place - at least for Pittsburgh. Their specialty is omelets and they feature every kind of omelet you can imagine plus more. If you are in an adventurous mood, you can try the Funky Monkey or the Breakfast Magic. If you are feeling less adventurous, they also have plenty of tamer savory or sweet options. You can also always build your own omelet.

The waitress took her time providing us suggestions, which was nice, but the number of options was a bit overwhelming at first. (Really everything was so tempting that it was just hard to choose.)"}
{"text":"My friends and I are all college students and we literally love this place. Have been here probably over a dozen times and I never get tired of it.

My favorites here: the Breakfast Magic, the Megaberry, their potatoes, and the make your own omelet! Also their COFFEE is some of the best coffee I've ever had. Seriously, I don't know how they do it.

Wait is long on weekends but get the NoWait app and you can wait from the comfort of your couch. My friends and I will hang out in the morning and head on over when it's close to our time, and we get seated almost immediately!

Cannot say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"I came here with friends before and we ordered the Breakfast Magic with Home Fries. It was delish!! At first I started wth the bourbon syrup but found it better with maple. 

Today I went back and decided to try something new. I ordered the French Toast. I wasn't impressed and wouldn't order that again. I also had a mixup with the server and what I ordered but I'm not sure if it was my not ordering clearly or her mistake. I had just run 9 miles and was hungry and didn't want to send it back, so I ate it.

I like that they have specials on different days. Breakfast Magic is $5 on Mondays and Funky Monkey is $5 on Fridays.

I don't eat that many carbs too often, so I probably won't frequent here, but I'll desire too!"}
{"text":"No excuse waiting so long to come here for the first time!!! Delicious breakfast spot. Super friendly staff - our server Eli was great! Everything was amazing... Cranberry sausage?? Yep! We will be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"Food took an hour to come out of the kitchen. It was sitting there for a good 10 minutes. We finally went up to the kitchen and asked for our food and showed out anger; afterwards the manager came up to us and offered to take care of our bill! Service was slow and staffing does need practice, but manager sure knows what he is doing! I do recommend this place for big parties or people with big appetites. I rate this at 3 stars because of the little dilemma with the food but overall this place was delicious!"}
{"text":"Incredible service & food. Per my waiter's suggestion I tried the Breakfast Magic waffle (with bourbon maple syrup), and was blown away. 3 full breakfasts & a healthy tip set us back less than $40. It gets a wait list early, but they have a text queue system so you can wander around some instead of twiddle your thumbs. A must-try for those hankering a good breakfast while in town (or if you are searching for a switch from the cash-only diners that are copious in the area)."}
{"text":"I have a hard time understanding how this place is so wildly popular. We stopped here last Sunday at the recommendation of a friend. First off, we waited 45 minutes to be sat no biggie, but when you see the tables sit dirty for 20 minutes it's a bit irritating. Next time, which i doubt there will be, we will use the app or whatever online seat ahead tool they utilize. 

After finally being sat, we get a glimpse of the menu. It's great! Really, it is. Many options, many great ingredients. We end up getting the vegetarian omelet, half of a waffle with sausage gravy and a half Funky Monkey waffle. So ultimately, one omelet, one waffle. Shouldn't be that difficult for an establishment with waffle in their name. 

Waiting. Waiting. Waiting... after 40 minutes of waiting for our food it finally arrives. All that i can think is, \"this better be good!\" The omelet was pretty good, while the waffles were 'Meh, i've experienced better.' The waffles were soggy and pillowy soft. If I were taking a nap on the waffle it would be ideal, but i was eating creamy peanut butter something and chocolate off of it. It needs crunch."}
{"text":"$3.25 upcharge ($9.25 total) for a generic bland vegan waffle with no toppings. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"We grabbed breakfast there this past Sunday. We arrived right after they opened, and were able to sit outside under the awning. Located right on Carson, it's a great place to people watch. The waitress was great; professional and attentive, refilling my coffee without a reminder three times (pet peeve is waiting for a coffee refill) .
On that note, their coffee(regular and decaf) is sourced from Beaver, and is really tasty. So, my husband got the berry waffles and I decided on the vegetarian omelet (which for some reason I can't find on the menu now, but it's there!) 
The berry waffle was a warm, large waffle topped with strawberries and whipped creme. They also brought out what I think was homemade syrup? He was impressed, and from my bite I was too. 
The real winner was me, though. The omelette came out white and fluffy and full of veggies and cheese! The veggies were fresh and NOT overcooked, the feta cheese just enough . There was a drizzling of spicy Mayo on top that added just enough kick for me, and I live spicy stuff. I added a side of pico for the potato side, which was cooked perfectly and salted just enough!
Will ABSOLUTELY be going back again"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for awhile. Went at about 930am on a Sunday. Got there and there was 30-45 min wait. Finally got seated and ordered an omelette, potatoes and toast with a iced latte. Coffee was tasty ,omelette was average at best. A little overcooked for my liking. Chicken and waffles was tasty very tasty and a huge portion. Half decent prices I guess but I think I expected so much more. The wait for the table is expected I guess but once we ordered it was 40 minutes for our food. I think it's way too long especially since the place only holds about 50 people max. It was ok, I personally wouldn't go out of my way to ear here just because of the wait times for everything.  Staff was super nice so that's a positive for sure."}
{"text":"J and I came here for breakfast last week. We used the No Wait App right before we left the house as we knew this place tends to get busy Saturdays. I highly recommend using this app.  We got there and we're seated quickly. We were actually surprised at how small this place was. We were expecting a larger space, but nevertheless it was nice. We liked the green and black color scheme. J and I both ordered the create your own waffles. His came with bananas, chocolate sauce, and vanilla ice cream with regular maple syrup. I had coconut, chocolate chips, and blue berries inside with blood orange sauce and vanilla bean infused syrup. Everything was absolutely delicious!! We loved the different combinations and had a difficult time choosing our toppings and fillings. There were so many other delicious options that we plan on making another trip to sample the make your own omelettes. We also met the most amazing patrons at the restaurant who let us sample their food because it looked so good! Definitely one of our new favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Love this breakfast place! Their waffles are delish and servers are fast! My fave breakfast spot in North Hills."}
{"text":"Nice ambience. We had crepes (me) and the breakfast magic (my son). Great service and really good food. Cappuccino was good too - for a discerning coffee lover like me. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A buddy of mine has been talking about this place for a while and he finally got me there.  The waffle was easily the best I have had in a very long time.  Kaitlyn, our server, was also very good.  My only regret was not leaving my phone number on the check.  :)"}
{"text":"I love brunch so this place speaks to my brunch loving heart. I enjoy the variety and creativity in their waffles and crepes and the fact that they have ample breakfast and lunch options. They also serve tasty breakfast potatoes, which I look forward to. 

However, every time I find myself here I do feel underwhelmed. The atmosphere and quality of the food is just okay. I recently had a crepe and there was minimal filling and the crepe itself felt chewy and not the kind of deliciousness you picture when biting into a warm crepe. 

I'm not opposed to giving it yet another try, but it's not a place I'm rushing back to any time soon with so many other breakfast spots in the city."}
{"text":"Just walked out of here after waiting an hour for a to go order....ended up giving us the wrong food. As it has always been with this place, great food, but probably the worst customer experience on the south side time and time again for most people who eat here. -- Still the worst customer experience on the south side."}
{"text":"Went into the restaurant and waited to be seated. Had a seat for 2. Lots of seating.  Restaurant was clean. Server came over quickly and was super pleasant.  I ordered the Carnivora Omelet with a side order of bacon and rye toast with coffee. My guest had the Megaberry with a side order of sausage. Order arrived quickly. The omelet with the egg on top was delicious. Filled with bacon, sausage, ham, cheddar cheese, chicken.  My guest Megaberry Waffle was huge. It had blueberries and raspberries on the inside and berries on top with whipped cream and a vanilla  bean sauce.  My guest advised that the waffle was soft and the berries were delicious. The sausage patties were large."}
{"text":"WAFFLES!!!!! This place is awesome. Waffles INcaffinated is a breakfast/brunch spot that will knock your socks off with some pretty awesome breakfast foods. It seemed, and rightfully so, that much of their menu is Waffle centered but they offer other things  as well including other traditional breakfast items and sandwiches if your not feeling breakfast for lunch.  

I had the single \"Sausage and Gravy\" Waffles with a side of the Sweet Potato Fries with the Cajun Jerk Marshmallow fluff dipping sause. The single cost you about $6.50 and as you can see in my pics is half of a rather large waffle. I assume the double is the entire Waffle which will run you about 8. 

Even though everything was very good I felt like it was a little over prices. I mean $6.50 for half a waffle? I mean it was covered in Sausage Gravy, but still if it wasn't for the $4 Sweet potato fries I would have left a little hungry. I feel $6.50 for an entire waffle would be about right in my mind but I'm am a little on the cheap side."}
{"text":"Waffles are amazing but Jesus can I wait for my food any longer. Not like waiting to be seated but literally an hr after sitting down. I was ready to order 2 minutes after I sat down. Now typically id rate that a 1 of 5, but again the waffles are pretty good. Sausage and gravy great, funky monkey great"}
{"text":"Great food. Waffles were flavorful.  Coffee was fresh. Kid meals included a lot of food for good cost. Family friendly.  We definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"They are the best waffles ever! So many varieties to choose from. The people are so nice that work there and they love when you take pics of your waffles to share with friends."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Waffles INC this morning for breakfast.  I ordered eggs over easy, bacon, home fries and toast.  The eggs arrived slimy and floating in a pool of water (literally).  The bacon was flavorless.  The \"house specialty\" home fries were dry and had no seasoning. 

This place is noisy and chaotic.  If you go, check in with their app or you will sit there and watch many customers get seated before you.

This place is highly over rated and over priced and is proof of the dearth of good brunch venues in the North Hills."}
{"text":"Lured in by seductive reviews and copious, drool-inducing food porn, my expectations were set high for Waffles Incaffeinated.  We arrived just before 10 on a Saturday morning and were seated in about 2 minutes in a packed house.  We must have timed it jusssssst right because a wait formed after us with guests lining the sidewalk to wait for waffly bliss.

On deck - coffee, an order of sweet potato waffle fries with the marshmallow dip, a Souther' and the special.  

Coffee was on point.  Very good coffee, hot, and frequently refilled by our attentive waitress.

Waffle Fries - fries were standard, it was the dip we were looking forward to!  Unfortunately, the dip came served to us pretty cold, and the marshmallow had set so that it was almost impossible to dip.  The dip was delicious, but serving temperature is key on this one.  Cold marshmallow = high viscosity.

Waffles - both entrees were good.  I really liked the Souther', which had plenty of jalapenos tucked IN to the waffle.  I'm not used to having my mouth tingle while eating waffles, which was great.  Sadly, the waffles were a little cold for both my wife's entree and my own.  They were slammed - I get it - but I shouldn't see the cheese only half-melted and cooled enough to re-harden when the plates are being dropped at the table.

We enjoyed WI and we'll go back, and I hope the cold entrees and app were just a fluke.  If that's the case, we'll be in 4-star territory on our way to 5."}
