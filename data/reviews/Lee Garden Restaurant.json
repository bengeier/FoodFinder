{"text":"The biggest tourist trap  in town and the only reason why I came back was my friend's wanted a clean place to in Spadina Chinatown for  her birthday.      Lobster with ginger   - too oilly for my taste  Ordered the tendor loin and avaoicdos   ok dish   Garlic back ribs  only gray thing on menu Chihcen veggies abd bird nest   - nest tasted stale Smoke chicken    only  ok     The food was only on parkway with any basic place in markham or  richmond hill   Here is the reason for the low rating.  I picked up a nice cake from dufflet.    We finshed eating and payed the bill.   My freind  coworker offer the wait staff half of the cake that we did not finshed.   It would been ok if anyone asked me or after they toke the tip.  But the waiter was staring  at me and did not leave.   I wanted it for us so we could have a min night snack.   Very rude of him and did not get the hint.     Overall a poor experience and I seldom have a high bar for spadina.   If yiu notice the clientele is  mostly non Asians.  Nothing wrong with that but is is the top ten restaurant in torobto.   Please check yelp or chowhound and there are NOT in the top 100 or top 10.      Lol   So if you want better places go to the pink peral at the harbour front or noble restaurant on dundas.   Sad sad night for my freind birthday"}
{"text":"Got there at exactly 4 p.m., opening time, on Saturday, Jan. 24, 2015.  First ones in the place!  Ordered ribs, fried rice, tofu and veggies, chicken and pineapple, chicken in black bean sauce.  Ribs came first, after about a 10-minute wait.  They were tasty.  Then came the tofu dish after another 10-minute wait.  Tasted okay, but not great. A bit over-salted.  By this time there were three other tables occupied in the restaurant so no reason for the time delay in getting the majority of dishes to our table.  After another 10-minute wait came the fried rice.  Again okay, but nothing special.  Another 5-minute wait for the pineapple chicken.  This dish was luke-warm at best, but tasty.  Then after another 10-minute wait came the chicken in black bean sauce.  This was very tasty, but a tad over-salted.  In conclusion, the service was terrible, the food was just okay, and the over-salting of some of the dishes was disappointing.   Would not come back here, and would certainly not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"What a poor resto Lee Garden has become. Mediocre food ( watery expensive shrimp wonton soup, Singapore noodles lacking punch, greasy spring rolls). Also had 2 drunks walk in and start harassing diners. So long, we will never be back! Too bad as it used to be good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always busy at dinner hours. People actually wait in line for an hour to eat here which is how you know they sell good food!! This is probably the only Chinese Restaurant I eat downtown because they sell the best and freshest seafood in all of Toronto, and I love SEAFOOD!! The staff and servers are very friendly and tend to socialize with all the customers at every chance they get. Service is quick and the food always looks good and ready to eat when they come out. I love their Lobsters! Definitely try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We found this place, when I asked a biker coming out of Ran Sol if they had good food. He said they found Ran Sol, when Lee Garden had a huge line they didn't want to wait in. The line both times we went were short. We had a ten minute wait. First time we had Hot Sour soup (very good), Duck soup (amazing deep rich flavor), beef on hot plate (little over cooked and not too interesting), and the garlic green beans (very good). The second time we had Lobster 2lb $28 ( fine, but messy. wouldn't get again), chicken breaded & fried (told it would be spicy, sent back to kitchen for more heat. they brought me a new plate. better with more heat). Beans (love them). Duck soup 2nd time wasn't as rich, needed to be cooked down a bit more, or something. still good, but not as good as first time."}
{"text":"Not sure why there's always a line-up for this restaurant. I've been here 3 times so far, and it's really not bad. But as far as authenticity goes, this barely passes as Chinese food. I feel that this restaurant is more geared towards the Chinese/Canadian audience expecting likelihood of Manchu Wok food. The service is exceptional though. The waiters are one of the friendliest you'd experience in Chinatown. Another good thing about this restaurant is that they don't use MSG. I wouldn't mind going back"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food restaurant in Toronto . Been going there for years !    Beef tenderloin Sweet and sour Pork Best fried rice Great tasting soups Food always fresh"}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times for dinner in total. This is a restaurant that serves mainly traditional Chinese food but they tweak it just a little bit to accommodate their Caucasian clientele (which is probably 85% of their total clientele). Seats are quite difficult to come by at dinner times.   The food here is top end for Toronto Chinatown standards but very average when you compare it to Chinese restaurants in GTA region. (There's better ones for lower prices out in Markham, Scarborough, Richmond Hill, etc.). It is also mentioning that Lee Garden is notoriously overpriced - maybe it's easy to overcharge when your competition in Chinatown serves F grade Chinese good."}
{"text":"Such a neat place to eat! The servers were wonderful! It was Friday night so place was completely packed, but regardless things ran smoothly. The food was delicious and even though my husband and I split a meal, we got to banana desserts. Loved their egg rolls! And the hot and sour soup was to die for!"}
{"text":"I've been a patron of Lee Garden for many years and it's rarely disappointed me so when I had a relative in town who was well versed in Chinese food, I took her there.  My suggestion if you decide that this is your spot for dinner on weekends --- GO EARLY!  If you get there after 6pm, expect to wait in line for 20-30 minutes minimum.  As for the food, everything is good.  It's standard Cantonese fare with all the staple dishes.  Specials are usually posted around the walls and are often worth trying.  The place is clean, service is efficient and friendly and the food always comes out piping hot.  If you're a seafood fan --- the deep fried cod with garlic is unbelieveable.  +ives: mostly everything; -ives: lines if you miss the cut off.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I prefer to eat vegetarian food--dining experience just....ok.  The only dish I truly enjoyed was the tofu pie. The service was quick & extremely efficient."}
{"text":"Senior gentleman on the floor was quite unfriendly, barely seemed to tolerate customers.  Tried to show me to an unpleasant table toward the back. My waiter was quite willing, but disappeared after the entrees were delivered, never to be found again. Spring rolls and shrimp wonton soup were mediocre.  Real wonton soup at other Chinese restaurants is far superior. My sweet and sour chicken was all sweet, no sour, with loads of sugar and a sickly bright Red Dye # X color, served with peppers  so undercooked they were basically raw. Deep fried tofu with Chinese vegetables was actually quite good.  White rice only - no brown rice available. Lights are much too bright for a dining ambience - more the brightness of a fast food restaurant. The website said this restaurant closes at 1 AM on Friday night.  The staff were surprised by that, saying it was more like 11 or 12, depending on the traffic in the restaurant. When the kitchen closed somewhat after 11 PM this Friday night, loud banging could constantly be heard all the way to the front of the restaurant, which was some distance away. Call me crazy, but I like good food, *some* ambience, and good service at a Chinese restaurant.  Not really what is on offer at Lee Garden."}
{"text":"The most expensive Chinese food I ever had.  Nothing really to write home about.  It was relatively clean for Chinatown."}
{"text":"So now that I'm an old chinese person, I must have Chinese food at least once when I'm in a city with a large Chinese population (and thus, good chinese restaurants).  We decided to try Lee's Garden after reading a lot of good reviews on the place.  We were not disappointed!  It was Saturday night around dinner time and we fully expected to wait.  The restaurant was always full and people were always coming in for a table but because the service was so fast/efficient that there was never any wait.  We ordered the grandma's duck, the beef tenderloin with cashews and avocado, and a tofu/veggie dish.  I would say that the duck was very taty and the tofu/veggie dish was okay, but the reason this place gets an extra star (for four total) is because of the beef tenderloin with cashews and avocado!  First off, the beef was so tender, flavorful, and melt in your mouth (is that a weird way to describe cooked beef?).  I wasn't sure how the avocado would pan out but it was actually very good with the beef!  It was still raw avocado,maybe quickly grilled, but it complimented the beef very well.  The cashews...well..you can never go wrong with cashews.  Definitely worth a stop if you are in Toronto!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Ordered the Set dinner which included shrimp wonton soup and deep fried boneless chicken in chili sauce with steamed rice for the entree. This is your true local Chinese restaurant and a must try. Everything was fantastic. All for $12 and includes a honey fried banana for desert. Sure the place needs a renovation, but once you drink some tea and get a steam whistle beer, the decor is forgotten. The service was a little slow, but the place was packed and had a line out the door, so you really can't blame them because the food was that good."}
{"text":"Had pork Combo dinner for one. Too much fat and bones. Not much rice.  Yong Chow Fried rice was quite good. Excellent and lean pork in it. The dish tended more to the sweet side than I am used to at my neighbourhood Chinese take out. The shrimp wonton soup was also good, but a bit on the salty side - very good while I'm sick - too much for me normally."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with this place. I usually head the poor reviews, but it was nearby and I was sure to like it. The food was meh, and felt \"Americanized\": the stuff served to match non-Chinese palette.  Please also cut back on the corn/tapioca starch. I can't imagine anyone wanting to eat gooey sauce.  Food was tasteless if nicely presented. Serving sizes were small. Each dish were not enough for three people to share comfortably.  If you want Authentic with a capital A, go ELSEWHERE please."}
{"text":"There was no line up when we arrived (Friday 7pm) but after us there were 10 people at least waiting. We waited more than 40' for our food, once we complained they realized our order was missplaced but work on it immediately.  Food was very good and tasty. A bit greasy but I expect that of Chinese food.  It's hectic in there. Waiters don't have time to come around asking if everything is ok, one needs to speak up if needs something (like water).  If you're not in a hurry neither starving then it's worth it. Will go back knowing what to expect."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good the last time I visited this place.   The beef tenderloin with avocado dish was quite tasty and unique.  The fried chicken dish was nice as well.  Would be worth 4.5 stars if not for the drunk people hanging out in front of the liquor store that is next door."}
{"text":"food is good, service is better than your usual typical chinese joint. at peak periods, expect a line up.  one thing I don't like is that there are tables right beside the line up. if you're seated there, people will watch you eat and very possibly ask what you're eating, depending on your level of social (or anti-socialness), this could be bothersome."}
{"text":"The service is really great and the food is not bad too. But this is westernized Chinese food, not what I am looking for in a Chinese restaurant. Hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by Fodor's and I was shocked to see it only has 3.5 stars on Yelp.  I can't speak to its authenticity as Chinese food but everything my three family members and I ordered was so tasty. We were lucky enough to walk in at around 5:30pm on a Saturday and get the second to last table before a line formed right out the door.  Aside from the fact that our server completely forgot about us and it was about 20, maybe even 30 minutes, before he came to take our order (we could not flag him down - we tried) - everything was perfect. I don't want to take any stars off because the poor guy looked so stressed.  Spring Rolls: Huge with meaty mushrooms inside Seafood soup: The Small is actually more than enough for 4 people to share if you're ordering main courses as well. Having this on a cold rainy day or when you have the flu would be amazing. They must have added some kind of starch to make it thicker.  The mix of tofu, egg white, scallops, squid, shrimp and fish is so great. Grandfather smoked chicken: juiciest chicken I've ever had, especially the white meat. The glazed and sesame seed covered skin is to die for. Beef with bell peppers & onions in black bean sauce: Such a unique sauce, very juicy meat and perfectly prepared veggies Total was about $55  Be aware: nothing comes with rice, you have to order it separately. Free hot green tea and refills.  The portions are huge. Although it may not be the cheapest place at a first glance, it's actually a good deal in addition to being delicious. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Average food with very poor service. So many better places in this busy Chinatown district"}
{"text":"I avoided this place for almost a year because the lineups were way. Too. Ridiculous. Even with \"reservations\", expect to wait, especially on a weekend. However, I recently found myself there (in the too-ridiculous lineup) again for a special occasion and wondering if the line spilling into the seating area/washroom stairwell was a possible fire hazard. But who cares? Everyone loves Lee Garden!  True, it is one of the few chinese restos on the Spadina strip where 85% of the patrons are in fact not Chinese, but Lee Garden is the exception not because their meals are Canadian-fied, but because it is just so darn good and really does appeal to all taste buds. Favourite specialty dishes here are: striploin (?) sitr-fried with black-peppered avocado slices, a tofu-as-omelette block filled with vegetables, and bird's nest with vegetables. All delicious - and all good.   Service here is top-notch indeed, which might explain the number of returning customers greeted warmly by members of the wait staff. We requested the bird's nest dish without meat (to accommodate our veggie friend) with our server, and when another server brought out the dish without the amend, our original server spotted the mishap from across the restaurant and hurried over and quickly swiped the dish away to replace with our proper order. Damn, he's good!  If I had the patience, I'd likely be here more often. However, the overwhelming crowds are well-deserved for this little establishment. Long live Lee Garden!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Seeing the star rating and the line up I was excited. Food was not good and I'm not fussy."}
{"text":"All hype unfortunately.   We ordered three dishes to share that night  1. birds nest with mango and chicken 2. shanghai noodles 3. fried rice with chicken  it's a very popular restaurant, expected a lot from the hype and the zagat ratings.   unfortunately, sloppy cut prep on the meat and vegetables, taste is okay yes it's not manchu wok food court but it's not like something one would get at Ding Tai Fung in Markham either.   Fried rice was cooked right, light and fluffy, birds nest taro tasted great.   Interior nothing to write home about either.. I think it's playing on it's popularity .. cost is too high imho for the quality."}
{"text":"Love this resto.  Amazing Chinese food, and I'm picky about my Chinese food (as a person made an honorary Chinese person thanks to growing up in Vancouver and having lots of Chinese friends).  Never had a bad meal there; everything is fresh and tasty; and it's pure entertainment watching all the dishes go by, fresh from the kitchen.  Do order the General Tso's chicken (#21 on the menu) with mango salad.  Amazing.  The hot and sour soup is the only thing I wasn't crazy about on the menu.  And if you have a silly, unfounded fear of tofu, this is THE resto to get over that.  My favourite waiter is Bill - he greets you, remembers you, and if you're a friendly regular, will offer pork broth before your meal and sweat bean soup for dessert on the house.  Don't be afraid of the line-up; it's worth it.  Push your way to the front to get a number, and push your way back to the end of the line to wait your turn.  Check it out."}
{"text":"The best hong kong style Cantonese food in Chinatown. Recently increased their pricing, we find it too pricey for the kind of food served."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Came here for Mother's Day. The demographics were certainly different from what you would see in Markham/Richmond Hill. Being Chinese eating at a Chinese restaurant, we were actually the minority, with majority being Caucasians. However, the food was still decent and not too Manchu-wok styles. We ordered fried black cod, grandmother chicken and zucchini fried with garlic. All ok dishes. I like how this place doesn't use MSG (at least that's what they advertise on their storefront). Food was still flavourful. I'd come back if I wanted a decent group place to eat."}
{"text":"Pretty impressive late-night NA-style Chinese food, filling and good value.  It is a bit oily but hey we were also ordering General Tao chicken and so forth that's what you're in for."}
{"text":"This was my favorite Chinese restaurant in Toronto. Why is it closed?!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard/average Chinese food. In other words, not the best I've tasted but still decent compared to say Manchu Wok or Mandarin. Mostly Cantonese style cuisine. They have some authentic dishes but I find a lack of menu options because most of their menu is too Westernized for me.  Very packed, always a lineup for dinner, this place is always popular and crowded for some reason - they have some really loyal customers. Despite this, customer service is still good, especially if you are a regular. They also have good Engrish to describe dishes you're not clear about (they cater to a huge English-speaking demographic).  Portions are alright, but expensive for Chinese food. Also a bit on the greasy, salty, and oily side. Great for the taste buds, bad for the heart. I don't suggest going often if you are attempting to live a healthier lifestyle...  Not where I would eat if I got to choose, but it is good with lots of people (ie. with family) and if you prefer more Westernized Chinese food that is okay in quality."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese restaurants in Toronto. I've tried a whole bunch of them but Lee Garden is the best.  Yes, they've gotten pricey over the years to be more 'upscale', but I can assure you that 10 years ago when I started going there, it was NOT that expensive and the food was just as good.  I still think it's one of the best in Toronto, even though the prices are higher now. The other restaurants serve Chinese food, but it isn't as good, and isn't as fast or as hot as it should be."}
{"text":"good food, if a bit pricey for what it is. We had amazing general tao chicken and a beef dish with nuts and avocado that I would happily kill for. Mixed veggies were fine if a bit greasy and we had about a gallon of white rice forced on us that we ate exactly zero kernels from. A big meal with beers aplenty came to about $60 which was more than I'd anticipated spending on Spadina but which I think I would happily do again."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by all the great reviews.  Went to Lee Garden because the other 3 restaurants i usually go to were way to busy (half hour waits)   Place was packed so it seemed like a decent restaurant to try.  We ordered the chicken corn soup, Shrimp Fried rice, shanghai noodles and the general chicken.   absolutely terrible.  soup was okay.  the rice and the chicken were completely  stale and the noodles were inedible.    Portion sizes were tiny and each dish cost about twice as much as all the other restaurants on spadina.  RECAP Small Portions, Bad Taste, Twice as expensive.   Place was busy so maybe it was just our group that had a bad experience."}
{"text":"IMAGINE!  A Chinese restaurant.  IN CHINA TOWN.  That serves good quality meats!  (*Jaw drops to the floor, yet again)  I'm always baffled by - and absolutely inclined to order - the \"Pan Fried Filet Mignon w/ Black Pepper, Avocado and Cashew Nuts\" when I'm at Lee Garden.  It's a standard sized dish for $12.00, which is a few bucks pricier than most Spadina Ave food spots, but finds itself at the lower end of this joints price list.   None of the options on the menu disappoint.  I think it's also important to note that Lee Garden is one of the few restaurants on Spadina that I frequent BEFORE I get wasted, as opposed to New Ho King which is strictly for post-bar meals.  Definitely more expensive than its China Town competitors, Lee Garden represents a step up from the standard."}
{"text":"for western style chinese food with a lot of more traditional items available as well , this place is most definitely \"woohoo! as good as it gets!\"  have been eating here for 15 years and it is the most consistent restaurant in toronto .  yes it is insanely salty - or sweet depending on what you order - but that is why it is SO FRIKKIN GOOD !  if i want to eat healthy food , i cook for myself , if i want mind-blowing authentic chinese food i go to markham (well , i dont bc its way too far but i would if that was what i wanted) , and if i want straight up delicious super crispy salty sweet spicy szechuan chicken with perfectly cooked white meat and tiny lil bell peppers and fresh ginger and garlic and hot chillis , then i go to lee garden  .   obvi  #21 forever !  (i recommend ordering it \"the old way\" with bb bok choy ;D )  our other white person faves include : beef with chinese broccoli which features very tender-chewy thin slices of beef as well as carrots cut into lil birdy-discs , shanghai noodles with loads of chicken (disguised as more noodles) , sizzling beef tenderloin , and crunchy mushy salty chicken chow mein with loads of super fresh delicious veggies .  the quality of ingredients and execution of dishes is so above and beyond the other spots on spadina , it really puts lee gee in a class of its own   if you feel like something different and healthier on the side i recommend the choy sum (pea shoots)  they also do have a reasonably extensive chinese menu that i never eat from but i have to say that having patronized this resto for so many years its not really accurate to say , as previous reviewers have claimed , that their customers are all tourists/whiteys .  i usually see quite a few groups of chinese friends and family eating here , as well of course as lots of tables mixed with various ethnicities , as is the wonderful toronto way !  i think they do a very good job of catering to various palettes , you just need to know what to order  for mid-range \"ethnic\" food , lee garden is absolutely my favourite restaurant in the city and i would keep it a secret if there wasnt already a steady line-up out the door !"}
{"text":"A little expensive but worth it....kinda like an R&G Lounge in san francisco - classic, been around for years, food  always well done, a place for both chinese and nonchinese folks, crowded at peak times.    We had the beef with mushroom, very good meat quality, which is not always the case with chinese restaurants. Enjoyed the hot and sour soup too.  I would not get sweet and sour anything, thats pretty westernized and they probably wont do it well."}
{"text":"Not the worst, but definitely nowhere near the best. We arrived just before the Saturday night rush and were seated promptly. That's where the promptness ended. I don't think this was the fault of the front of house staff as our drinks arrived without too much of a delay, but the food took forever. We didn't get our spring rolls until we were finished our chow mein and lettuce wraps. This was an hour into the meal and having to ask three times for them.  Cantonese Chow Mein was very bland. The shrimp, scallops and pork were delicious and tender, but the portion was very small. Lettuce wraps were okay. Nothing special. Spring rolls, once they finally arrived, were super greasy.  Maybe there are more \"in the know\" dishes that we ought to have tried, but I don't think I'd wait in line to eat here. It wasn't bad, just not wait-worthy IMO."}
{"text":"Go for the #21. ??? Deep Fried Boneless Chicken in Chili Szechuan Sauce ($16).   Stay for the #09. ??? Hot & Sour Soup (Pork, Shrimp, Tofu) ($9.50 for small, feeds 4).  Everything else that we had:  #71. ????? Sautéed Beef w/ Ginger & Green Onion  #45. ????? Shrimps w/ Fresh Chinese Vegetables  #90. ???? Singapore Style Vermicelli Noodles (Curry, Pork & Shrimps)  ... was very serviceable.   As one of the more expensive restaurants in Chinatown, the quality of some of the items was noticeably better than most, and the portions seemed large."}
{"text":"Arguably the best Chinese food in Toronto. Don't believe me? Walk by and observe the front window covered in Zagat, Now Toronto and other \"recommended\" stickers, copious newspaper write-ups and praise from celebrities. The menu is expansive and if you are able to read Chinese, the seasonal specials on the wall do well to compliment the menu's offerings and then some. The price is higher than other Chinese places in the city, but once you taste the food you will understand why. This restaurant sees frequent business and often times you will find it packed with a line-up out the door, even on Sunday evenings. Reservations are recommended but not completely necessary. The service is professional and the liquor menu diverse, offering most domestic and import brands, including Asian favorites like Tsingtao. I'm not a person of principle but whenever I want good Chinese food, Lee Garden is the first place I turn and I have yet to find much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Old white people love it here. It's totally fine but not the best or most original. Toronto has way better options. Good for groups tho."}
{"text":"this is one of the better chinese restaurants in chinatown and im chinese, its authentic, good food selection, decently priced -1 for the open kitchen which makes your clothes smell all the time"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to finally try out Lee Garden Restaurant after years and years of seeing busy line-ups spilling out onto the sidewalk.  The experience was...okay.  The prices are about 20-25% higher than typical Chinese restaurant prices...we know that because we are used to dining at the other two Chinese restaurants just a little North of this restaurant.  We ordered our usual dishes for comparison's sake.  The double lobster with ginger and green onion was quite tasty...very meaty and enticing display.  The sweet and sour pork was quite tasty.  The Cantonese chow mein was a bit bland for my taste.  The satay beef on a sizzling platter fizzled too quickly...just not hot enough for our liking.  Also, we are used to order rice in a large bowl as we are a family of 6.  However, they insisted that they don't have large rice bowls available and only small individual bowls...a bit of a cash grab if you ask me.  The service was alright...one of the managers (I suppose) was a bit impatient in his demeanour but the other staff members were quite friendly.  Very spacious restaurant and I'm quite surprised that with its more generous dining space, it's always full...and quickly in the evening too!  In terms of experience, it was acceptable but nothing outstanding.  For a comparable meal and since I'm always looking for better value, I think I'll stick with the other two Chinese restaurants right up the block..."}
{"text":"This was my favourite Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. Their hot & sour soup had the perfect balance of spices, and they deep fried garlic shrimp is what dreams are made of. With it closed all of a sudden, I will be on the hunt for a new establishment to get those dishes!"}
{"text":"I agree with Paul L. - I don't know what the hype is about.  To be fair, I didn't order the dishes, so the styles may have been different (canton vs. mandarin dishes).  So, I may need to give it another go - then re-rate.    My review is pretty much exactly the same as Paul L's hahah reading his parallel to mine is quite funny.  Had the LOBSTER- it was meh.  RIBS were delicious over a bed of veggies.  We had DEEP FRIED FISH - couldn't tell it was fish until we finished the tofu.  The SWEET & SOUR PORK was generic - nothing too spiffy.  We had the FRESH STEAMED OYSTERS which actually were quite tastey, fresh and huuuggeee.  This was my fav dish.    Overall, nothing to grovel over.  All the places on Spadina are on par with each other.  I would go there again upon different must have dishes - please recommend!!!  Everything tasted very generic and generic...  Service was ok.  VERY busy, even with reservations."}
{"text":"This is another favourite of mine during my student years.  After eating horrible residence food, a meal here is like dining in heaven.  I loved this place for what it offers when you can't afford haute cuisine.  Some of the best dishes I have tried are at small restos like these."}
{"text":"From tons of great Chinese restaurants to choose from in China Town (go figure), on a whim, we chose to drop in Lee Garden. A typical Chinese restaurant which looks the part inside and out. They've been sitting on Spadina forever and are still pretty busy all the time. Strolling in on Wednesday night at 8PM, was no different. Almost all tables were taken but the turnover seemed quick so waiting wouldn't have been so bad either.  Outside, the stand-up board displayed their $12 dinner menu. Included was a soup (wonton or hot and sour), an entree ranging from chicken, beef to tofu and 4 other options, followed by dessert (like typical red bean/green bean soup or something with banana, I forgot). I went with the garlic, ginger and green onion beef with hot and sour soup. My friend opted for the pork loin in sweet and sour sauce, while my other padre ordered off their everyday menu and had steamed cod with black bean sauce ($18).  The restaurant was large, enough room for everyone and very lively. Filled with mostly middle aged couples, families and business men. Some teens, and then there was us. Everything was clean and well-lit and although the service was friendly, it was very slow. The dishes came out one at a time with 5 min intervals in between each. It felt like we entered an eating relay race because one of us finished our dinner before the other came out, with the last dish arriving 20 minutes after the first (and that was with a lot of reminding, hand raising and prodding).  On the food side, everything tasted great. The beef I ordered was super tender, flavors were on point and with rice, it was even better. Portions are reasonable but not large. The Cod came as two fillets and they were silky, coming with a ton of flavor even for a steamed dish. The pork loins were tender beyond belief and the sauce wasn't super gloppy and corn starch latent. Maybe the tenderness came from 15 minutes of hammering and pounding... idk.  Overall, Lee Garden was tasty, the service time was iffy and the atmosphere feels like any other Chinese restaurant. Come here if you want a good meal that will satisfy your Chinese food cravings but not surpass them by any stretch,"}
{"text":"This is still the best quality Chinese food in Toronto.  Great quality protein and veg and amazing work hay. In response to the numerous 1 and 2 star reviews complaining that there are too many white patrons and the food is too Westernized and not \"authentic\"....I suggest going to Markham for pigs intestine or down the street for 3 dolla pork wonton soup... plenty of options for you. Also the fact that they don't use MSG is HUGE! 99% of Chinese/Hakka restaurants use this toxic ingredient. Is that what makes Chinese food \"authentic\"? Yes it's expensive here but for the quality of food and the creative menu it's by far the best resto on Spadina."}
{"text":"You can tell this place is popular when it's packed for a time that is quite late for normal people to have dinner (11pm).   Lee Garden has been around forever. I haven't visited since my high school days, where my friend used to order their fried rice dish (cheap and huge portioned) and down the whole thing in one go. Impressive. Glad to say after all these years, the portions did not diminish (the prices are a different matter).  If you are ever in Chinatown, I would recommend this restaurant located just a tad bit north of Dundas. It is authentic. Even if you see a wide mix of people! It's because they like the food.  Black bean sauced beef rice noodles. Sweet and sour pork. Mmmm.  Will be back if ever in the Chinatown / Kensington Market area.  However, It is more expensive than other Chinese restaurants in Chinatown (like the ones with the hanging pigs out front, and their $5 noodle with fish balls in soup dishes). Some dishes are actually a lot more expensive. Expect dishes that are offered normally at places like Congee Queen for $10-12 to be $16-22 here. To get a good deal, choose a noodle dish that comes with a meat and some veggies.  Also gets loud here. since the tables are close to each other."}
{"text":"Came here the other night with my boyfriend. I heard that the szechuan chicken here was of the best in the city, not to mention that Lee Garden as a whole is considered to be one of the top authentic Chinese restaurants in Toronto.  Ended up going for their dine-in only prefix dinner menu which costs $14 per person. We both went for the shrimp wanton soup. This was actually a lot better than we were expecting it to be!  It was quality shrimp in the wanton, perfect amount of green onion, and really hot too....nothing better than hot soup on a cold night  We also ordered 2 pork spring rolls on the side, which were huge and full of flavour, it was great! For my main, I obviously went withthe szchezuan chicken, and I have to say, this truly is the best I've ever had! Usually,  I find that when szchezuan chicken is served, the chicken becomes almost soggy as it's likely been soaking in its sauce for too long. At Lee Garden , the chicken was perfectly fried and crispy still, while simultaneously being generously covered with sauce.... I loved it! It also came with a bowl of plain white rice. My boyfriend ordered the short spare ribs, which unfortunately he didn't enjoy too much, but he too loved my chicken.  For dessert, it came with a fried banana which was good, not great. Service was okay, nothing over the top. Overall I enjoyed my time here, it is a little in the pricier side so if you're searching for a cheap Asian dinner, don't come here. Will likely return for that szchezuan chicken though, it was too good to describe hehe!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant in Chinatown on a friend from Toronto's recommendation and we were not disappointed. Since our group of 4 were in Toronto on a business trip, we got to order a large array of dishes and expense the bill. Yessss...I love good Chinese food. One of my coworkers spoke fluent Cantonese, so we let him order and this is what we got: duck meat soup, spring rolls, white rice, lobster w/ ginger and onion, tofu with vegetables (mushrooms, etc) in garlic sauce - this was my favorite dish that we had, the sauce was incredible, sizzling beef, crispy chicken, a fried pork dish. We finished off the meal with the sweet bean soup they give everyone and then we also added the dessert, which was bananas, fried and then caramelized with a sweet syrup, kind of like a Chinese version of bananas foster.   Wow, I'm not sure if I've ever eaten more in one sitting in my life. We were all ridiculously stuffed afterwards, but it was worth it because the food was so good....wasn't that expensive either. For all the food we ordered (probably enough for 6 or 8 people), I think the bill only came to around $120 CAD. Service was attentive and friendly as well. I would definitely like to return to Lee Garden on another trip to Chinatown in Toronto."}
{"text":"For the high volume of business and upscale prices it charges, I wish this restaurant would add a few extra floor staff to improve its table service. The ingredients are consistently fresh and the dishes generally flawless, but the servers here are always overwhelmed whenever there's a queue forming out the door (a nightly occurrence). The food isn't so out of this world that I can overlook that aspect of a dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been in Toronto for almost four years now, and I've only just managed to start venturing out to Chinatown. Hmm... But I'm glad I did!   A few months ago, after seeing the David Bowie exhibition at the AGO, a few of us wandered over to Lee Garden for dinner. We ordered Vegetable Spring Rolls, Deep Fried Squid with Garlic Pepper, Singapore noodles, Seared Beef Tenderloin with Avocados, Sweet Peppers, Black Pepper and Cashew Nuts, Crispy Fried Tofu Pie (I think we had it with Pumpkin?) and a fried rice dish.   The deep fried squid was SO GOOD! For sure, that was my favourite thing that we ordered that night. The Singapore noodles had a weird sweetness to it; I wouldn't order them again. The beef tenderloin was good, as I've never had avocados in a Chinese dish before. Everything else was good, but not awesome.  I'd come here again for the spicy squid though! The lobster also looked very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Came here with my parents for a Sunday night dinner. I guess everyone else had the same idea as us because it was packed. Service is pretty good with staff often coming around to tables. The menu is a good size - not too overwhelmingly long yet there is something for everyone. We ordered three dishes with 2 bowls of rice (Sweet & Sour Chicken, Sautéed Chinese broccoli, beef sirloin in sauce). Generous portions, you will likely take food home. For a night out in Chinatown, Lee Garden is a good choice.  Good for: tourists, Chinese food"}
{"text":"I haven't been here since my college years. Since I was visiting Toronto, I decided to stop by the old joint. Food is still yummy as ever. Every dish that I ate is equally delicious. Birds nest, lobster, sweet sour pork, fish, and soup. Didn't realize how much I missed this place. Must try! Just have to get there early to beat the dinner crowd which starts around 6 pm. It can be a long wait. Your mouth will be salivating while you stand in line and watch people enjoying their food."}
{"text":"Let's just say that there's a reason why most of the people eating here aren't Asian. ;) Worse yet, the hype has turned this place into some sort of tourist trap. Everything my dining companion and I had was either overly salty or really bland. Granted, they don't use MSG but the other flavors just fall flat. The roast duck was especially overcooked and dry. The fried rice was good, but... it's just fried rice. Save your money and eat Chinese in Markham instead."}
{"text":"An oldie - but not anymore a goodie :-(  Okay to take Tourist family too - in order to give them a little taste of China Town.  Seems to be packed - but not necessarily with locals these days - seems more tourists.  I remember Lee Garden wayyyyy back in the day when you could get Special Coke - no you didn't sniff it - it was alcohol (Vodka/coke-cola) after bar hours.  Those days the food tasted so good - but then maybe it was because I was younger, and my tastebuds weren't as developed as now :-)  Back in those days Lee's seemed more authentic, food much tastier, and the price point was an amazing deal.  Boy has that ever changed.  Sure the place is packed - but the food is mediocre - not good - not bad - just okay food.  The price for China Town is a tad more expensive than the other places around.  if you are heading to Lee's the wait for a table during the weekends will seem long - but they seem to turn the tables around in a jiffy - so what seems like a long line-up is not so in real-time.  The Lee's I remember back in the day was a bit more laid back (now it's table in - table out),   I also remember the portions being a little more generous and a lot less $s for the food.  Now it's a bit more of a well oiled machine - with okay Chinese Food - China Town vibe still there a little - even if it is a tad more \"plastic\" in the vibe department - but then again that matches their China Town Old School table cloths."}
{"text":"Get the dinner for 4 if you're going in a group- it's a lot of food at a very good price, $70+tax. It changes regularly, so be sure to ask your waiter. If you plan to go there for Saturday dinner, get there before 6 or be prepared to wait for a while.  Lee Garden offers some of the tastiest Chinese food I've had in Toronto thusfar. All of the dishes were nicely prepared and tasty, and came in large portions. I particularly enjoyed the Szechuan chicken and the deep-fried shrimp."}
{"text":"Here are the cons: - it's expensive - the portions are small - the menu is not very large for a Chinese restaurant - the food is tasteless EXCEPT for the chili fried chicken - poor service (but that's pretty typical of Chinese restaurants)  I should have known it wasn't going to be good. There were an awful lot of white people and not enough Chinese people. It clearly wasn't authentic enough for them!"}
{"text":"The food is great. On a busy night there is always a line up.  Check your take out order before you leave. Last time the guy messed it up even after he had me write down the numbers of exactly what I wanted. Repeated it back to me (all three items). Had me pay for it. And even though there was only total of 4 other patrons at the early dinner hour they still couldn't get it right. So annoying. Not impressed. Might look down the strip for a new Chinese restaurant to remain loyal to.   Try the hot and sour soup, taros nest of seafood, ginger beef, sweet and sour pork... All of it is good."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there at Tuesday early night. There were not very busy so the atmosphere seemed to be a little gloomy.  We ordered the dinner set for only 12 dollars and the food was good but not very impressive. Two types of soup, one is hot and sour soup (not very spicy and contains some tofu and bamboo), another is shrimp Won Tun ( three shrimp dumplings in the soup).   One main dish we ordered was deep fried chicken in chili Szechuan sauce which was actually very sweet but not spicy at all...I expected to taste a tender chicken but things go contrary.That is why I only rate it as a three-star. Another dish was stir-fry beef with onion which was much tender than fried chicken.   Desserts we chose the bean soup and caramelized banana. The green bean soup was added some orange peel and tasted very comfortable but the banana was too greasy, sweet. Not my dish....  The Chinese food was not very authentic but not bad. Personally, I thought I can do much better on some of those dishes. BTW, the waiters were nice and served us very quickly, so you don't have to wait for long time."}
{"text":"\"...Lee Garden on Spadina has been packing them in and serving up incredible eats since Trudeau reigned (Maggie may have even eaten here after hanging out at El Mocambo with The Stones). Consistent, efficient, scrumptious and easy on the wallet.  Patience is often required as line-ups are par for the course but the beauty here is that patience is always returned to their customers in as generous a portion as the food...\" Excerpt from  http://morevanilla.com/post/32654316425/i-was-surprised-by-my-whole-family-for-a-birthday"}
{"text":"Very good food but one of the 4 guests did not receive thier meal until after we were all finished eating. NOT GOOD!  I would go again but my expectation has been lowered."}
{"text":"I went here before the Jazz Festival with a friend of mine and ordered two dishes, a black bean beef and the other I can't remember, we also ordered the small wonton soup.    Food- Wasn't good, the meat was excessively fatty and overbreaded with no real taste really low quality meat. The wontons were bland and the soup had no flavour.  Service- Was fine, food didn't take too long and waitress was helpful and restaurant was clean.  I wouldn't go back not cause of a bad experience but just definitely poor quality food, love other chinese restaurants that would be much better!"}
{"text":"Whenever I go to this and other chinese restaurants with comp dessert it's always red bean.  Red Bean!!!  I hate red bean soup, and green bean is even worse.  Anyways, service here is ok and bordering on indifferent.  The really nice guy (older guy with grey hair, glasses) I think his name is Bill.  Don't confuse this guy with the other guy with glasses and salt and pepper hair.  Anyways, our meal was made fantastic because of the nice waiter.  When I asked if I could get my fav sago coconut soup for dessert he abliged.  If he wasn't here I doubt I'd return.  Food is good but the portions are small."}
{"text":"As authentic as Chinese food gets! Always great quality and consistency. Be sure to try the stir fry green beans with shrimp paste, the fried glutinous rice and stir fried angus beef with avocado and lots of black pepper. Otherwise, other traditional Chinese dishes here are of decent quality. It's probably a bit pricier than you'd expect, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been to lots of Chinese restaurants and this is one of the best.   The food is authentic Cantonese cuisine.   Try the fried salt and pepper shrimp or squid or the steam chicken with ginger and green onion."}
{"text":"The food here is tasty. It's definitely a dependable option in china town.  However, it's a bit pricey - bordering on the $$$ range.  I don't think it's \"worth the wait\". If there's a line, then you're better off with the other solid options in china town.... House of Gourmet and many more.  If you have this much to spend, try Dynasty (in yorkville) which is more of a gourmet experience."}
{"text":"I love Lee Garden. Not only is the food consistently magnificent. The staff is so friendly and happy. I have brought so many people to Lee Garden, especially for the beef tenderloin with grilled avocado. It's incredible."}
{"text":"There's so many Chinese restaurant in this area. However I highly recommend the Les's garden the best. Very clean, good service which I had hard time to find in other Chinese restaurant.   I normally have seafood bird nest, fried rice . Not too greasy, not too salty . Just perfect for me.  Just one thing remind that little bit expensive than other chines restaurant, but I rather have a meal that I can trust ."}
{"text":"This is \"the\" place to eat and experience quality Chinese food in Chinatown.  This restaurant has been a fixture on Spadina ave for years and the food is amazing and consistent.   I grew up in Chinatown & I have always look forward to a meal here.  Well worth lining up for."}
{"text":"Awesome pure Hong Kong Chinese Foods and highly recommended. You never try you never know #"}
{"text":"No star for them. The service has gone to a point where I cannot even go back. Hundreds of times visiting this local and I can honestly say I have had enough. Went in and wired for over 30 mins only to have two tables seated and greeted by name ahead of us. I guess my face wasn't familiar enough to cut the line. We were then seated with another family and when requested a second menu were told they would get us one later. Then sat for 30 mins waiting to at least be acknowledged. Left unfed and angry. avoid as it seems the Chinatown conditions are getting worse and service is even more second rate then before."}
{"text":".5 for service  This is probably the first time I've ever had dinner at 4:30. Partially because I wanted to be home in Markham at a reasonable time (I didn't have the car), but also I wanted to beat the lineup for this place. It worked, we were the first ones in!  We ordered the sauteed mixed seafood with vegetables, grandfather chicken, deep fried black cod, and beef tenderloin with chinese steak sauce on hot plate. It came with a complimentary soup, which...was rather tasteless. Good for those health conscious, but it definitely did feel bland.  The mixed seafood with vegetables tasted very good! The squid they use certainly is more unique and not those types where you can choke yourself with. The scallops and shrimp were also good, and the vegetables were just the right texture, not too hard or soft. The beef tenderloin was also good, and I really liked the sauce that came with it. On the other hand, the grandfather chicken was a little disappointing as it felt everything was all mushed together. The fried black cod was okay, but there was a lot of oil in it (it does make sense though, it's fried).  Will I return? There's other options in Chinatown, and of course since I live in Markham, aka the home of fine Asian dining...maybe."}
{"text":"I went here and they upped their prices by a LOT over the past 2 years, which is when I was last here. Today we ordered the beef tenderloin and schezuan chicken. A lot of the reviews here say that the price is worth it, but I am in total disagreement. While they don't skimp out on ingredients (ex. our beef dish had many cashews and avocado pieces), the portion sizes are SO SMALL for the price they are charging. We ordered just 2 dishes and steamed rice, and all together after tax and tip paid $55 total. The food was not bad, but definitely not worth their new increased prices. We will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"A well known restaurant in Spadina ave. Open every day 4:00 pm to 11:30 pm A friendly staff, great food and affordable price."}
{"text":"Lee Garden has some mighty good food.   Our party of seven had lunch here and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The food was delicious and the seafood dishes were reasonably priced. They may not be the most generous of servings, but they were not skimpy either. Try to deviate from the normal Chinese fare (i.e. fried rice, sweet and sour pork, etc) by choosing from their specials and you will be rewarded.  The food was neither greasy nor too salty. They were all cooked perfectly, from the vegetables to the meat to the seafood. The service was polite and fast to boot.   We left full and happy about choosing to have lunch at Lee Garden."}
{"text":"This is not your typical Chinese Food Restaurant, save for the fact that it is located on Spadina and has an entirely Asian staff.    Unlike many Chinese food restaurants, most things on the menu are not deep fried and served up on your plate in the form of a ball.  Rather, the food is all very fresh looking and the dishes are unique.   Some of their specialties include, the whole steamed pickerel, the Beef tenderloin with Avocado, and the crispy shrimp.  Unfortunately many people know abut Lee Garden and as a result the prices lie on the high end of normal for Chinese Food so if you're bringing with yourself a big appetite, you're going to have to bring a pocketbook to match."}
{"text":"I'll keep this one short because everybody knows how awesome Lee Garden is... We've been going for about 14 years and it is worth the long lines I promise. Best Chinese food in Toronto. That's all."}
{"text":"We finally made it to Chinatown.  Quite larger than expected.  There were a very interesting mix of people, with quite a number of tourists.  By the time we walked up there, I was hungry again, since I just had a salad and some fries at the CN Tower.  Looked up restaurants on Yelp and found Lee's.  AC felt good when we walked in.  We sat near the front.  Ordered the stir fried Shanghai noodles with chicken, shrimp, and vegetables and an order of Chinese mixed vegetables...trying to keep it healthy...LOL!  Both came out at the same time and tasted great!  Okay, maybe a little greasy but that's what makes it taste so good.  I get tired of people complaining about greasy Chinese....don't eat it then.  The owner was very nice, and made us feel at home.  Some of the menu items were written in Chinese hanging on the walls.  Great place to come to!"}
{"text":"Decided to go to Lee Garden last night because my wife heard good things about this restaurant. When we entered, there were a few people waiting and we only waited about 15 minutes before being seated.  We each decided to order the set dinner for one which includes a soup, choice of entree, rice and a desert. As entrees we chose the sauteed beef with ginger and onion as well as the fried minced shrimp and tofu pie. Our soup came quickly and soon after the entree arrived. Everything was delicious. For desert my wife had the red bean soup while I had the deep fried banana. Overall I am very happy with the food, the service and the price for the set meal (12,99$). Next time we will try something that is not part of the set meal because it looked good on other tables. The only negative thing I have to say about this place is that it is a bit crowded and tables are close to each other."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in town. The dishes are distinct to anywhere else. The price is higher and that's why many Asian rather go to a cheaper place. This is one Asian resto where Asians are a minority lol.  But the price is well worth it and not that expensive for what you're getting.   Service is organized and good. The line up is long after 6:30 so if you want to beat the crowd come before then. As with Asian places it's low key and don't expect it to be like the Keg. Interestingly enough all the servers are male. There has to be a story there which I don't know about.   Notable dishes: beef avocado and order it with the birds nest (extra), orange pork ribs. Those are my two favourites."}
{"text":"A born and bred Toronto friend brought me here claiming it to be a favourite of his.   We tried eggplant in black bean sauce (an off menu item the waitress offered to put together) and the ho fun lo mien. The food was great - on the oily side but who cares it was tasty!   The service was quite slow and we had to really wave to get water and later our bill. They also forgot part of our order and we had to remind them. That's the reason I bumped them down from 4 to 3 stars.   Would recommend - it's vegetarian friendly and delicious! Just go in feeling patient!"}
{"text":"There is a reason why they have been around for so long. No matter how busy they get, their service doesn't get discounted. I think that's why they usually have at least a quarter of the patrons who are regulars.  I don't feel like they use MSG, but they somehow manage to grind out REALLY tasty food as fast as fast-food restaurants....if not faster...my wife and I have yet to order anything from here's that we don't like."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout on Sunday night. Not that great and not better than any of the other cheap Chinese restaurants. Generally had an oily taste and left a slick of cooking oil in your mouth.   Chicken and sesame was quite good as were the pork ribs. Everything else was disappointingly bland   - veggie stir fry, chow mien dishes, beef and broccoli , etc.   Ok takeout but we'll keep searching for something better. A bit high price for the value ($200 for 7 dishes plus rice)"}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended by a family member.  For those of you not from the area (like me), here's a list of what we ordered:  -Soft Shell Crab Appetizer - Fried & crispy, very well done. -Shredded Duck & Mushroom Soup - Good but felt like it wasn't salty enough...and I'm not a huge fan of ginger. -Stir-fried vegetables in Taro Birds Nest - Vegetables done well but I've had better versions of this... -Cantonese-style Beef Noodles - I felt like it was overly greasy and the noodles they used were too thin and didn't put enough beef -Lobster with Green Scallions- Meaty but not enough sauce. -Fried Bananas - Bananas were a bit mushy and the breading outside was a little excessive but overall, decent.   I think I'm really picky about my Chinese food so I'd have to say this place was good but not fantastic."}
{"text":"Now this is what I call upscale westernized Chinese food.  Most of the time, I try to avoid any restaurants that has less Chinese customers to a minimum and I might've made the mistake of coming here. If you don't frequent Chinese food much and don't mind quality, you might like this place. Otherwise, I'd avoid it.   I had their infamous Grandfather Smoked Chicken and I can't say I didn't like it because it wasn't all that bad. It was only the skin that tasted like honey and the rest was just plain chicken but reminds me of General Tso's chicken--without the orange flavoring.   I've also had the beef tenderloin with avocados and cashews and it's a very interesting experience. You'll rarely find avocados in any Asian dishes and it was a nice touch to it. The beef, I was not a fan of since there was too much pepper but should be fine if you eat it with avocado at the same time.  Nice, fast service but this is pure Westernized Chinese food--except you're not eating out of a styrofoam box and it's slightly better than take-out."}
{"text":"It was Christmas Eve, and our last chance to do our traditional Christmas dinner (ALWAYS Chinese) before leaving the country.  Friends told me that Toronto's Chinatown was the best in North America, so - as we were in Toronto - I set about trying to figure out a way to maximize our one chance at getting it right.  Based on reviews, we picked Lee Garden.  Boy, did we score!  First, we had a wonderfully helpful customer base:  as we stood in line at the door (and yes, there was a line at 10:30 p.m.; the restaurant takes no reservations), we admired the scrumptious-looking dishes that sent to-die-for wafts our way.  All of the diners were eager to tell us about what they had ordered and to encourage us to do the same - some even offering up samples.  No snooty diners:  promising factor #1.  Now, if you're looking for an intimate, romantic joint, this ain't it.  It's not too many steps from counter service, truthfully, and getting to the bathroom requires a bit of a hike and a map.  But we were smelly and tired from our long drive from Chicago and just wanted some delicious fare.  That we got.  The youngest of our group, a 14-year-old with a stomach ache, got the sweet and sour chicken.  Despite his condition, he polished off the entire plate of it and spent a sizable amount of our ensuing trip talking about how delicious it was.  The shrimp wonton soup - which three of us shared, with plenty to spare - was delicious and not overly salty, as is so often the case.  The beef tenderloin was out of this world, as was the Grandfather chicken.  Were it not, like, 800 miles from home, I would make a weekly trek to Lee Garden and am already thinking about how we can get there again soon."}
{"text":"Went here for dins tonight with a rather large group so I had a chance to sample a wide variety of dishes.  All in all I was satisfied.  The best dishes were the ones I would least expect - the sweet and sour chicken and the black bean chicken were both very tasty, but my favourite was the Shanghai noodles (who knew?).  I also tried my regular stand by, Singapore rice noodles, but those lacked flavour.  We ordered one of the special dishes - a deep fried lobster which in my opinion was a big meh.  Our server looked constantly frazzled and it took forever for someone to come take away our empty plates, but beyond that, it wasn't too hard to get someone to attend to us earlier on in the meal when stomachs were rumbling and timing really counts.  I would deffo go again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, dinner at Lee Garden is a once-or-twice a year indulgence for us.   Not because of the food, which is great.   Not because of the price, which is eminently reasonable.   It's because of the line, which is cramped and exceedingly long, often snaking out the door, unaided by a borderline-fraudulent reservations policy (oh, they'll take your name all right, but you still wait with the plebes until they're damn well ready to seat your party, no matter when the Christmas Day movie starts). Seriously, people wait 90-minutes plus, sardined in the front hallway, for the privilege of eating dinner while being stalked by the people behind you in line.  That said; it's still kinda worth it.   Once you sit down service is prompt and friendly. Tea is immediately proferred, and menus placed in hand.   The food itself ranges from old school egg rolls, chicken balls and proteins with  fresh, crispy mixed veg, to more exocit offerings like Grandparent Poultry, or lobster chow mein. The latter is a particular hit; sweet morself of lobster flesh clinging to shells, draped over a bed of noodles.   Veggie items are worth a look; greens are consistently crisp and vibrant, no matter which dish. Beef is surprisingly good quality, and duck is divine.   A bowl of hot and sour soup delivers on both front. Won ton soup broth is mostly salt, but the dumplings are popably succulent. Arriving with a timid bunch, one time we order what feels like eight chicken dishes. Surprisingly, they're reasonably distinct and each id good in its own right.   Hard-core Chinese Food fans are still probably better served in Markham, but with retro Chinese places a dying breed, Lee Garden deserves at least an occasional visit.   Just try to get there on the early side."}
{"text":"Bad. We ordered duck soup and were served chicken soup. When questioned the waiter answered: 'They put chicken instead of duck because chicken is tastier than duck'. The rest of the dishes were over greasy and salty. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Went out with some friends last night who were craving some Chinese food.  Being the only Chinese person in the group they asked where we should go.  I wondered where non-Chinese people would want to have Chinese food and immediately thought of Lee Garden.  It didn't disappoint.  The wait time was short and the food came out quickly.  We ordered a lot but every dish was so tasty, hot, and flavourful that the food disappeared very quickly.  I was surprised at the prices though.  They seem to have gone up quite a lot since coming here last a few years ago."}
{"text":"I really like Lee Garden. I was with 7 people and we waited about 20 minutes for a table - pretty reasonable for a Saturday night, I'd say. We ordered a lot of dishes, but my hands-down favourite dish of all time at a chinese food restaurant ever is the beef tenderloin, avocado and cashew dish from here. Delicious. Next time I will be greedy and order one for myself. We ordered a lot of food and the bill was roughly $18 a person, which I thought was pretty much amazing."}
{"text":"Had the munchies and my buddy was craving chow mein so we decided to hit up lee garden.  Hot and sour soup: this really hit the spot. It was spicy with nice chunks of meat. (4/5)  Fresh lobster with ginger, green onion, and garlic: I love lobster and this tasted amazing. Shoulda got two order of this and nothing else.. Maybe next time. (5/5)  Yang chow fried rice: a very good fried rice. Really enjoyed it (4/5)  Cantonese chow mein: one of the best chow mein I've experience. Well done with chunks of meat. (5/5)  Overall, food was excellent, service was okay, but usually expect chinese restaurants to have meh service."}
{"text":"From the outside, Lee Garden is an unassuming restaurant.  When you enter and see their offerings and menu, you realize it's a bit more fancy than a typical Chinatown place.  They've been around since 1978.  I'm not sure if that's a big deal since I'm not familiar with the history of Toronto's Chinatown.   I decided to go to Lee Garden, on Monday, for my first dinner on this current T.O business trip after reading positive Yelp reviews.  I would agree with the general consensus that the food is authentic and decent, but also agree that it is pricey.  I didn't see many Chinese customers, which leads me to believe that there are other restaurants that are just as good as Lee Garden, or better, that are more affordable in the area.  Lee Garden seemed gentrified, which makes sense from what I've been reading on Yelp (that the prices here have gone up a lot).  Their menus are available online, in pdf form, at: http://www.leegardenrestaurant.ca/menu.html  I ordered Dish #44: Sauteed Shirmp with Chili Pepper & Eggplant ($16).  The portion was large, so it was enough to serve as lunch for the next day.  The shrimps were good.  However, I was disappointed that the dish was not spicy at all, which was the reason for me ordering it.  Adding in steamed white rice cost another $2.  I realize it's standard, in Toronto, for rice to be tacked on as an additional cost.  I'm just used to rice and tea usually being free, in most other places.  I'm not sure if Lee Garden is supposed to be a Catonese restaurant since I did see Sichuan dishes listed on the menu.  I am willing to give Lee Garden another try to see if I like the place or not.  The next time I go, I would like to order the Grandmother's Roast Duck and Chicken."}
{"text":"This is the classic Toronto location - has been great for over 20 years. Still awesome. Hot and Sour soup was really hot and just spicy enough, sczechwaun chicken was solid, eggplant was great, green pod shoots tasty and healthy and the secret most amazing dish most Torontonians don't know about Tofu Pie (see picture). PS - if you have room get the fried bananas."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating here for years. It's hot, cramped, long lines, yada yada. What it lacks in service is made up for in the quality of Lee Garden's food. Yes, the food is very greasy but most Chinese places serve greasy food in grimier settings. My favorite dish is the avocado, beef and cashew. Crispy skin chicken is yummy too. Apparently the chefs don't use MSG. Expect to walk out smelling like Chinese food."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the fuss is aboot... sorry about... =P...  This place isn't THAT remarkable.  It's pretty good.  We ordered the lobster and the ribs.  The lobster wasn't phenomenal, but the ribs were pretty tasty.  I know a lot of people will hate on me for saying this... but my favorite chinese place in north america is the house of nanking in san francisco.  yes.  i know that cockroach infested tourist trap gets a bad rap.  but it's fantastic.  this place is just okay...."}
{"text":"I remembered the days when I came down to Lee Garden Restaurant to eat at least once a month.  I no longer visit here anymore and I don't remember why..  But last night visit did bring back memories.....   The interior and decoration is just like it used to be. The one thing I am glad is the ladies room is clean and even smell good!   Service here is excellent and fast! Maybe just a little too fast as I know some dishes should have taken longer to prepare and cook.  We ordered:  Szechuan Chicken ($16) - bland tasting chicken breaded and deep fried - sauce is more sweet than spicy - the crispy chicken is really soggy too  Smoked Chicken aka Grandfather Chicken half ($15) - The most disappointed dish of the night, since this used to be my favourite dish - Chicken suppose to be moist and tender with this smokey flavour from tea leaves, the honey sesame flavour from the glazing but what we served was a chicken that tasted bland, dried and the half of the skin was not even there  Sticky Rice with Chinese Sausages ($11) - Usually sticky rice suppose to made to order so there is still the fresh from the wok taste, but this rice was arrived on our table lacking everything   Zucchini with Garlic Olive ($8) - Not a bad dish but the garlic olive flavour definitely missing   Honey Orange Ribs ($18) - I really not into honey orange sauce and this definitely not my go to dish usually  Both the complimentary soup and red bean dessert were overloaded with orange peel... taste was off... balance was off  I can definitely have much better meal at this price point at a lot of higher end restaurants uptown which offers much better prepared food.  Sorry Lee Garden, I don't think I will ever come back, even for Old Time Sake!"}
{"text":"Great place for interesting and tasty Chinese food. My favorite dish is the Grandfather Smoked Chicken with honey and sesame.  Usually crowded though with a lineup at the door if you come during the dinner rush.. That's a sign that this is a good restaurant!"}
{"text":"Lee Garden is probably one of the least intimidating restaurants on Spadina -- It's got an english name, easy-to-understand menu, a clean atmosphere, and a line-up out the door. This means that tourists will flock to it, and so will locals, and that's not a bad thing unless you're really hungry and not in the mood to wait.  This place is actually really good, with reasonable prices, and cute decor inside. I've had a lot of veggie dishes from here that have made me happy, as well as delicious noodles that aren't overdone with grease. Haven't tried any seafood dishes, but I can say that the standard beef and chicken dishes are all done well.   If you walk past Lee Garden, and there isn't a lineup, definitely give it a chance. Otherwise, there are other places -- you are in Chinatown after all."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday evening around 6pm with a party of 5. We waited around 10 minutes before we were seated.   We ordered Fresh Lobster with Ginger Onion (35$) which was around 2lbs which is a good sized portion for a lobster dish. Our second dish was Seafood in Taro Bird Nest (24$) which was also a good sized portion for our party of 5. Lots of scallops, shrimp, some octopus along with vegetables. Our last dish was Fried fish with ginger and onion (I can't recall the exact name) around 25$. Again, the portion was a good size and the flavour was rich. I would suggest getting a bowl of plain white rice (2.50) to go along with your dishes as the ones were ordered were quite oily so the white rice went along well with it.   We were also served pork bone and carrot soup before our meal began and was served red bean porridge for dessert, both complimentary which is rare nowadays in asian cuisine.   I docked one star for the poor ambience. As soon as I walked into the restaurant, there was a thick and heavy smell of smoke and I started coughing. Throughout our meal, I noted there was bad ventilation throughout the restaurant and especially in the kitchen.   Overall, I am a fan of this place aside from the ambience. The food was tasty and the service was quick and responsive. Will come back in hopes that their ambience improves."}
{"text":"If you are visiting Toronto, you have to have lunch or dinner at this place.  It is always packed.  The food is fresh and it us one if the best Chinese food restaurant s in TO.  My favorite is the birds nest - crispy noodle with chicken and veggies.  Fried rice is also great... Expect to wait in line if you come at peak hours but it is worth the wait...."}
{"text":"I liked this restaurant because the service is fast and the food tasted good. The honey bbq ribs were really yummy and I would recommend that. We also ordered some veggie dish and a seafood dish (forget the names). They were both good but it was too much food for just 2 people. The servings are quite large so don't get more than 1 dish/person.   I would recommend this restaurant if you're in Chinatown!"}
