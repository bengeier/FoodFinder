{"text":"We have eaten at \"The Spread\" buffet at least 4 or 5 times.  Overall, the food has been good and the service adequate (for a buffet).  I'm not a big fan of buffets, so I like the way the food is presented (many items served in individual small dishes) rather than watching everyone maneuver your food with a large scoop from the caldron!  

Since we have been there several times (always for dinner) I have noticed that the service is not always great.  The first time we went (shortly after the casino opened) the service was exceptional.  The staff was all over everything!  They even brought out coffee for us while we were up getting dessert (without us even asking for it) and it was awesome!  The service has never been that good again (sadly) but it has been decent, with one exception.  We had a server one night that fell ill and left.  We were all fine with her leaving because nobody wants a sick person hanging around...but nobody told us!  So, we kept waiting for her to come by for a drink refill and/or some coffee but she was nowhere to be found.  After nearly 30 minutes we stopped another worker and we were then told \"she left\"!  So, that ticked us off a bit.  But, for the most part we have enjoyed the buffet.  

Like the other reviews say, some of the food is overcooked and bland.  I have found some favorites that I like, so I stick with what I know is good.  They usually have big, delicious, shrimp cocktail and it is very good!  I also enjoy the Mac & cheese station, the prime rib and the desserts.  Some of the Italian dishes have been pretty good too!  So, you just need to be selective and if it's not good, don't eat it!"}
{"text":"I've been there often and have tried all they offer: brunch, lunch and dinner. The selection is incredible and definitely has something for everyone. The quality of the food is absolutely great!  Salads are fresh and there's everything from veggies, fruit, fresh rolls, an array of pizzas and pastas, Asian cuisine that's irresistible, sides galore, roast beef, roast turkey, ham, pork, plenty of offerings for vegetarians and vegans.......and all of it is extraordinary.
The staff is friendly and professional, and none of it seems phony or lacking in any way.  With family, a date, or a just-for-me getaway, I head downtown and sit an enjoy (at my leisure) some of the best food that's out there.......oh, and did I mention, for a very affordable price (?)... especially when you compare it to large city dining!"}
{"text":"Don't ever sit near the salad station.  That's where the kitchen door is located and the noise level, laughing and screaming and slamming plates, makes this place sound like a high school cafeteria.  Food is good 3.75 out of 5, but ambience ?!! Not again."}
{"text":"Do not waste your money going for dinner. The prices are higher for slightly better food. Save money and go for lunch."}
{"text":"Dinner on last Thursday night was kind of busy.  I never care much for buffets because I always feel as if I'm stepping in front of someone or they are stepping front of me in the line. (Oh, I just want to steal one little piece of that yummy fried chicken!) Yeah, the last chicken breast on that table.  So, now you know how I was feeling while walking around trying to find something appetizing.
The desserts were pretty good, not great. The problem was some of the cut cakes should have been kept cold. When I tried to take a slice of cheesecake it stuck together and stuck to the serving piece. Too warm and soft. There were cute little tarts but no sign as to what they were.  The brown one turned out to be peanut butter, not really my fav.  The food selection was okay.  The beef they carved was quite good and tender. The best item I found was the salt and pepper shrimp, which are breaded and quite tasty.  Find them at the Asian stand.
Service was a total zero.  They take your drink order when you pay.  OK, so the pop did not come.  I got up and asked one of the waitresses and can you believe she said it wasn't her station and she did not get our drinks or get our waitress! Holy Cow!   The busboy was busy and we asked him to please tell our waitress we'd like our drinks. Now this was at least 15 minutes of a wait so far.  We had already brought our food back to the table and were awaiting drinks.   Rodney, the busboy, was wonderful and although it wasn't his job, he quickly brought our drinks.  Our waitress never, not once, came to our table, although she walked all around us.   We felt she was avoiding us and didn't want to walk to the corner table we had.
We never got coffee because we had no waitress.  We told the hostess and she said something to our waitress who then began to glare at us all the while still avoiding our table.  The 4 people next to us left her just one dollar tip.  We left nothing for a tip as she never approached us.  Instead we tipped the busboy!
Sorry to be a downer on this one but I guess good help is hard to find. And that makes all the difference.  Goes without saying but we don't plan to go back there."}
{"text":"Went on Friday night (shrimp night). There were three or four ways shrimp were prepared and all were very good. Of all the dishes I tried, none were disappointing. I thought many of the selections were quite pedestrian, and that some of the food stations needed a little help... example the Mexican station could have had Guacamole and Tortilla chips. Though I'm not a Prime Rib fan, I thought theirs was about as good as it gets. 
Our waiter was very attentive, and friendly."}
{"text":"We visited the buffet for the first time last night. While I believe the food was typical and what one would expect from a buffet, I was mortified at the entrance, paying, and waiting to be seated experience. I truly thought there were going to be fights over getting seated. There was ZERO organization to this process. I am not even complaining about the wait, however, due to the lack of organization people were yelling at each other about who was next. I think they would be well advised to remember that their customers include senior citizens and should add somewhere for them to sit while waiting to be seated. I could have enjoyed my time if I didn't feel I was going to be enveloped in a brawl over being seated and if my mom wasn't in tears from the pain she was experiencing due to standing for 30 minutes. We paid $140.00 for four of us to eat...that was our first time there and will be the last time."}
{"text":"Received a free lobster dinner with my total rewards card from the casino. Showed up on a Thursday around eight o clock at night and there was an extremely long line. Luckily my friend is a diamond player and we had our own line with only one couple in front of us. As soon as we were checking in we were advised they were all out of lobster. I guess you have to get there early before they run out. Guess we weren't the only ones lured in with an empty promise for a free lobster tail. We were seated by the hostess after about a five minute wait. The weirdest thing was they seated another table of two before us when we were clearly next in line. We were told after we were seated that we could start eating and our drinks would be there shortly. There was several stations, one for desert, Asian, American, Italian, carving (prime rib, turkey, corned beef etc) and maybe one more that had a mix of different kinds of items, all the best stations had lines (carving and American). Round one was salmon, meatloaf, risotto, some kind of pasta dish and a wedge salad with blue cheese and bacon. By the time I got back to the table, ate all my food (was all pretty good and I haven't ate a bite in nine hours and I was starving) still no drinks. I got up to go get some Asian (looks good but is bland, not authentic and a complete waste of time) our drinks still haven't arrived. I had to wave a server down, ask for drinks and still waited another ten minutes. This really pissed me off and I'm getting upset again right now while writing this review. They lost a star for service and I shouldn't have left any tip.

Since I didn't eat my Asian I went in for round 3 on some ribs (surprisingly very good) turkey with mashed potatoes and gravy (waited five minutes for the gravy to heat up on the grill) another F for fail for the wait staff who convinced me they can care less about my dining experience. My friends said the corned beef was really good and it looked good but I can't confirm because they were out and lied and said more would be out soon and never came. FAIL...

Desert was really good, I had mini cupcakes (yummy) cheesecake (melting) but flavor was good and a make your own sundae. You will love this concept, maybe ten different ice cream flavored to choose from (vanilla, strawberry and choc chip) was very good ice cream. Topped how I like. I was stuffed but I need to gripe more about the service. This is a strong word but I hate their service. Their staff seems to be purposely trying to lose customers. I have never had this many service disasters in one experience. They should all be fired and replaced with people who care. That is all"}
{"text":"The casino has to make high margins, right?  The food quality here is a half-step above food service quality.  Translation:  skip it.  You are paying for access to ridiculous amounts of less than mediocre food.  Meat was dry.  Desserts were dry and chemical tasting.  Gelato was more like ice milk.  Head upstairs to the food court for WAY better food like the Rosemary Garlic fries at B Spot or even a slice of pizza from Rocco & Rosie's."}
{"text":"Went to the buffet on Thursday.  I've been to quite a few buffets but this one was undoubtedly the worst I've ever experienced.  The serving area was a total mess in certain stations, especially the salad section.  There was lettuce and toppings scattered everywhere.  And none of the employees working in that area seemed to care. There was food and silverware on the floor and the server just walked by a couple of times and did nothing about it.    The food was sparse in certain sections.  They seemed slow to refill.  The prime rib was way overcooked and wasn't tender at all.  The pork was very tender but was extremely dry.  Waited an unusually long time for drinks and then one of the drinks was wrong.  And while the server didn't say anything, her expression showed she was annoyed.  But she made the mistake, not our group.  I've been to this buffet many times and it seems to have gotten progressively worse.  They are way overpriced for the quality of the food and the selection of items.

I think this buffet has managed to work their way to second behind Golden Corral.  lol"}
{"text":"Awful. Bloody awful. I was comped and still felt ripped off. Prime Rib was like my dogs chew toy. The fried chicken was ok, but little cool. Salad is decent, pizza is bad. Cookies are tollhouse. 

Wasn't great as Horseshoe, but even worse. Not sure why anyone would pay full price."}
{"text":"That was one of the worst buffets I have ever waisted my time going to the entire place needs help bad and I don't think you guys have ever heard of refilling food at all."}
{"text":"Well we ate here for a Sunday Brunch which may have actually received a 4 star but after today's dinner experience for the price we have to give it a 2 unfortunately. Unlike Sundays fairly full brunch crowd, the Tuesday dinner crowd was at a minimum. There was also no sign of an executive chef or even manager going around to make sure the food and service was up to standards. With that being said, 85% of the items were old and dry. When being that slow that need to make smaller portions more often. I was extremely saddened with everything for being so excited to attack the buffet prior to our arrival... 

Just one other reason that disturbs me about the casino as a whole is that we were regulars for a while spending hundreds of dollars (sometimes winning, sometimes losing) and have not received any promotions or anything where as a few people we know don't spend a penny over there get a few free buffets a month... Just kind of bothers me that we haven't even gotten one. Oh well. I suggest if you're going to pay for the buffet make sure it's busy or the brunch. Otherwise just keep walking by."}
{"text":"it is inside horseshoe casino in dtn cleve.  the salad bar is 10 feet long with lots of fresh veggies and fruit.  beef= prime rib and brisket.  lots of chicken and cooked veggies. best turkey i ever ate in any restaurant!  chinese and italian stations with great marinara sauce and steamed broccoli. don't go on crab leg nite unless you want to wait over an hour for a table.  lots of nice desserts incl. 10 varieties of gelato.  service is \"a\" 90% of the time.  my complaints: most dishes too salty and the soups are all lousy!!!  i miss their ny cheesecake that was wonderful, but discontinued.  it's a great buy for $13 from 11am-2pm and $22 from 5-9 or 10pm.  best buy in downtown cleve!"}
{"text":"It's now the Market District buffet and we've eaten there several more times since my last review.  We ate dinner there yesterday and everything tasted very, very good.  There was a man serving macaroni-n-cheese with your choice of items to be mixed in such as mushrooms, vegetables, ham.  He was very friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Being from the Buffalo area, we have the Seneca Niagara Casino and if you've been there, you know how bangin' that buffet is. I mean it is gigantic and I didn't realize how great it was until I left the area and visited other buffets.

I came to this buffet with a group of friends on a weekend and was excited for the buffet style dinner, so I can eat till I literally fall asleep. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. The food was bland, and they did have enough options I suppose but the quality wasn't there for the price. The six of us probably ate just one plate each. You don't even get close quality to what you paid for.

I couldn't help but think the entire time how awesome our buffet at the casino in Niagara Falls. As much as I wanted to like this place going in, I just couldn't.

I would not come back here unfortunately."}
{"text":"Prior reviews are right on the money. First off all atmosphere; its ok.. .looks like a buffet. Food selection is pretty good. They have several stations; each offering food from a distinct region. The problem is the selections at these stations are underwhelming at best. The selection is only outdone (and not in a good way) by the lackluster taste of the food. Overall bland, overcooked and not-homemade tasting.

Muscles in some sort of sauce that is far to sweet and commercially acquired (try hiring a chef guys). Key Lime pie that is not made with Key limes and has some sort of glaze on top with green food coloring (I guess it is supposed to represent the essence of lime? Really?? The pie is made with everyday limes, likely from concentrate. 

The meet station had brisket and some sort of 'steak'. The steak was WAY over cooked and dry, like eating the bottom of a shoe. The Brisket was ok but nothing to write home about. My 13 year old can make a brisket so don't get to excited here; its almost impossible to completely screw one up.

I left reasonably full and found myself wondering why did I go?  I feel ripped off. For 5.00 I would have thought hey its 5 bucks.... I had a meal, next.. At nearly 20.00 I mean I could have gone to the Chinese buffet for a week and had better food.... I am not saying that the Chinese Buffet is any good mind you, I am just saying its better and at about 30% the cost.

I wont be back to this restaurant and likely not the establishment overall. The casino looked decent but my first exposure to them was this buffet and it left a bad taste in my mouth, PUN intended.

Additionally to the poor food quality the restaurant is in the basement of the building. You would think that they would have installed CELL boosters so that you would have good reception down there. My phone received NO data and they don't offer WIFI?? Are you joking me? Wendy's has WIFI, a lunch at Wendy's is five bucks. Maybe with the 28.00 dinner they turn on the WIFI?

In closing crazy amounts of food laid out all of which poorly prepared and tasting less than Chef created and more un-boxed and microwaved.

I encourage you to go just so you can experience the disappointment that I have."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to the Horseshoe in Cleveland and overall I enjoyed my experience and found it to be a much better casino than than the Hollywood in Columbus that I normally play at. I signed up for a players card and after an evening at the roulette table was comped at buffet trip. I certainly was not going to pass that up being hungry and an hour away from my home and free food. I wandered down to the buffet and overall I found the the service to be better than many of the reviews I have read on here. Although I will admit it was a Tuesday evening so I'm not quite sure how the staff handles a more busy time. As for the food itself I found it to be OK (great for a free trip lol).  I enjoyed the Kong Pow Beef and found that it really delivered the kick that so often Kong Pow Chicken/Beef is lacking at so many places. I also enjoyed the Prime Rib, as it is my favorite dish, It was just slightly overdone for my tastes but I do enjoy mine quite rare and I'm sure it had been under a heat lamp for a while so overall I will not hold it against them. I also enjoyed the salad bar that featured wedge salad and the Horseshoe Chop Salad which was surprisingly good and one of my favorites of the evening. I tried a bit of the Lake Erie Perch and it was not bad, not good but not bad. I avoided the Pizza and really everything at the Italian Station. The pizza looked far to done and just not that good and really everything else at that station just seemed sloppy and thrown together.  For me though I found the two biggest disappointments to be the dessert station and that I was told they almost never feature oysters on the half shell.  The dessert station had mediocre selection at best and I asked the gentlemen working the station what he recommended or what was good that evening and he simply told me everything was good. Well that's not what I asked you. I asked you to recommend something even if there is nothing you particularly care for just tell me that such and such is very popular this evening. Its a small thing but I was surprised that no one had ever coached him or the staff on this point. As for the oysters, I understand this was a free trip and a weekday evening so I did not necessarily expect there to be the prime time options. But I did inquire if there was a time or nights when they do feature them often and I was surprised to learn that it is very rarely offered from the wait staff. To me oysters on the half shell should be a casino buffet staple and should be featured or at least be out on Friday or Saturday nights.  In conclusion I would say that my casino experience at the Horseshoe Cleveland was good and I do enjoy it better than the Hollywood Columbus but the Epic Buffet at the Hollywood Columbus is slightly better (4 stars out of 5). However The Spread at the Horseshoe Cleveland is not a bad option and I am grateful for free trip! Would consider coming back especially if I had another sort of deal from the Players Card!

Suggestions to get from 3 to 4 Stars- Better dessert station options and better overall options"}
{"text":"I am pregnant so I may be the wrong person to review a buffet ! I thought this place was wonderful in the options of food !!!! They had tons of breakfast choices ( healthy and not so healthy ) omelet station, eggs Benedict station, waffles , donuts, breads , eggs , quiches, turkey sausage, frittata, and much more. They had a pizza station , Asian station , carving station , ice cream station and many more deserts ! I didn't give it five stars because the staff was horrible. Need to hire some quality workers who are polite and smile."}
{"text":"Not sure about the other reviews of The Spread. 

We've visited for lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch. There have been lines once or twice but each time the staff has moved people in quickly, the tables were always bussed and drink service has been prompt. 

The food offerings have been varied, prep and replacement have been prompt. The quality of the choices can vary, but the meats and desserts have always been impressive. Rare prime rib is always tender - and would benefit from grated horseradish vs. creamy, but is always moist and not fatty. 

Salads and pastas can be really good or the stereotypical buffet products - so - if they aren't interesting or look tired, just move on. Filling up on mediocre items and then complaining about it defeats the benefits of a buffet. 

Special items can be great - check out the Shuffle area for options. The Asian area also seems to have interesting surprises each time. The fresh fruit is always a small but stellar display at the opposite end of the display from the Asian display. 

The servers are always friendly and prompt. We've been seated next to a bus station and the bus boy was amazing. He moved dishes so quietly that we didn't even notice his work. 

It's a buffet. It has variety, it's kept well stocked and sparkling and you can always find delicious options. With special offers from Horseshoe we'll definitely come back and enjoy the food fest.

The food gets 3 stars - the servers we've had take it up to 4."}
{"text":"I cannot believe these reviews! We had breakfast here over the weekend and absolutely loved it!  I was taken aback with all of the options. They have different regional stations.  I loved the variety of choices.  They had like eight different kinds of breakfast potato.  I was able to try four of them and they were delicious.  I had a made to order omelet and it was so great! What shocks me the most about these other reviews is the terrible service people talk about.  I had the exact opposite experience,  I talked to many of the chefs as they prepared food and found them to be absolutely delightful.  I was sad when my omelet was done because I was having such a good conversation with the chef making my omelet.  I would give the customer service a 100% Maybe lunch and dinner are different but I would highly suggest this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"I went to the breakfast buffet as part of a group.  They knew we were bringing a group of around 60 people because we had the side room reserved, yet they had ONE cashier on the register to get us through the line and paid.  That cashier was also in quite a tizzy over the line and was having issues dealing with people who had cash.  Eventually they did bring over another cashier, but that was after over 15 minutes of waiting.  You choose your drink at the cashier and then are given a slip with that drink on it.  

When I went to sit down, I saw a server walk by and tried to give them my drink ticket.  She told me she was \"really busy\" and would come back.  In the meantime, I had gone up to the buffet and gotten my first plate of food.  I came back and the drink slip was still on my table.  In general, the servers seemed to be a bit cranky and somewhat inefficient.

Overall, not a bad option for a $10 breakfast.  The buffet had the typical breakfast favorites but also tried to be a bit fancy with some options.  For example, they had two types of hashbrowns, ham, bacon, eggs, cheese grits, french toast and an omelet station.  They also had three different types of ham, thick bacon, roast beef hash, fritattas, etc.  It was a huge variety of food options for breakfast.  However, none of it stood out as being exceptional.  You probably can't get a decent breakfast for the $10 price tag in the downtown area it is in, so for that reason, it isn't a bad option.  Just don't expect a wonderful experience with top notch food and service."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill.  The food does not seem fresh and the service is horrible.   Even the cashier Michelle had no idea what she was doing. Completely took nondiamond members over diamond members.   I really hope that the casino works to improve this place."}
{"text":"Pretty solid buffet, but they are making you pay for it. It's probably one of the best buffets in Cleveland, and they do have some choice options, but still, nothing is truly fantastic, and when I'm shelling that kind of money, I'd prefer to do it on something really good.  

The rack of lamb was close, but that was it. For brunch they had smoke salmon, which was nice. Everything else was just good \"for a buffet\" which you'd expect with that kind of price...

If you are really hungry and feel like eating pounds and pounds of food, and are to picky for a standard buffet, this is your spot. If you just want a nice meal and are willing to pay, there are better options"}
{"text":"Last weekend, we decided to have an early dinner and try our luck at the casino before heading to a show. Since we had plenty of time we decided to take advantage of a buffet and tried The Spread.
Hearing good reviews we thought we would hit the jackpot especially seeing the long line of other patrons waiting to get their shot at it...
Let's start with the salad bar...great if your trying to eat like a rabbit, but why would you at a buffet.
The Italian Bar was little to be desired the pasta was dry and lacked seasoning.
The American side offered individual baskets of fried chicken and fries, the chicken looked over cooked but was pleasantly seasoned and juicy inside. They offered a variety of other items but the au gratin potatoes were the best!!!
The Carvery had roast beef, turkey and  roasted chicken, turkey was okay but the roast Beef was like chewing gum, ugh! 
The Asian Bar, go to a Chinese take out joint, you'll be better off!!! However, if you like shrimp, do like other patrons and pick out as many of the jumbo shrimp you can out of the shrimp stir fry, because the rice noodles and vegetables were tasteless.
The Shuffle offered a number of Of items including ribs-tasty, fried fish-crispy and tucked in the corner a macaroni bar, which I guess was Mac n cheese cooked to order, not sure because the two times I went over there wasn't a cook, but I did see him there when trying other stations.
The best station to me was the dessert bar, which had any type of dessert you want from cookies to cake to ice cream to pie. My favorite was the triple chocolate cake and coffee ice cream, my husband loved the turtle cheesecake.
Now that I've talked about the food...service and atmosphere... Service is little to be desired, but then again it's a buffet they pretty much bring drinks and clear tables, absolutely no interaction... And the uniforms they wear are quite shabby and unappealing. The decor is nice, but a bit bright for dinner ambiance. It is also clean. 
Overall, great if you like a buffet, but only two or three items stuck out from the wide variety of food offered...not quite on par with Las Vegas Grand Buffets, but okay for the Cleveland version!"}
{"text":"A lot changes in a year...
Had dinner here tonight... The cocktail shrimp were gone. Almost no seafood. The chef small plates were gone. The desserts were mediocre. Everything that I loved and gave 5stars for... Is no longer part of the buffet.
-------
My old review:
I also am shocked by these poor reviews. I have been here 4 times in two years. Hands down - it is the best casino buffet I have ever had!  I gave it 5 stars for a buffet. If I was giving it a regular restaurant review I would still go 4 or 4.5 stars. The cocktail shrimp are enormous and very tasty! The small chefs plate that are available are outstanding. It's expensive but not a bad value."}
{"text":"No longer called the Spread buffet.  The Market District Buffet at the Jack casino was quite a disappointment.  Food selection was scarce and what was there was not appetising to the eye.  They charged extra for the holiday, however there was nothing extra about the food or selection.  A bright spot was the gumbo soup, it was tasty. I am sure that we will find another place to eat when visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"The cost was a little high (at least i thought for a buffet), the wait and organization sub-par (we had several shameless people cut in front of us multiple times while waiting to be seated), but it was the after effect that gives \"The Spread Buffet\" its rating.  All I want to say is that both my wife and I wish that the food stuck around a little longer.  We had to leave the casino earlier than expected due to the foods desire to vacate our bodies in a most unexpected and undesirable method.  Maybe it was karma from my, \"binge and purge\" joke before we were seated, or my \"I look forward to gaining back the 10lbs i just lost,\" joke. Whichever it was, we did save money on the laxatives that we would have never bought."}
{"text":"Depending on what you choose, a five star or one star review could be fair. Be wise at the buffet and you'll be rewarded. Scout carefully. Choose things that turn quickly or things that can handle a steam tray well. Lots of hits and misses, but isn't that true of any buffet? I docked stars for the misses, but I've been able to find enough here that I'll be delighted to return to test my selecting talents some other time."}
{"text":"Very good buffet for a casino. My wife and I had complimentary buffet and saved $50 dollars on Prime Rib Buffett

Chines vegatables , including steamed broccoli was excellent Chines pepper shrimp was tasty
Salad Bar was good
They had potatoes au gratin which was very good, and you don't see very often. The prime rib was also grilled if wanted and was excellent
Italian area had baked gnocchi which was good
I was too full for desert"}
{"text":"Management is horrible.  My friends and I came all the way down here after hearing great reviews about the food but were met with utter disappointment. It seems like most of the favorable reviews were submitted before the change in management. 

- Waited in line for an hour
- Most tables were not filled because they were dirty with no one to clean them. 
- In other words, customers weren't waiting because the buffet was crowded. It was because there were not enough waiters. 
- When we were seated, most of the food was empty because there were not enough cooks in the kitchen. 
- There were only 1 or 2 waiters serving each entire half of the restaurant, so of course service was slow--we didnt even get all of our drinks. 
- Waiters were unable to multitask between serving guests and cleaning tables so the dirty dishes ended up being placed on already-dirty tables that could've been cleaned to seat more guests. 
- There were two carving stations but only one person behind the counter... leading to long lines for a single piece of meat. 
- The whole prime rib they brought out was not cooked in the middle. Carver had to cut pieces and throw them on the grill. Even after it was placed on the grill, my piece was still raw (see attached picture). There was no way I was going back in line for the third time, so I left it.
- Again, most of the food was empty and took too long to be refilled so I can't give a proper review on the food itself. From what I could gather: there was not much variety offered. Mostly side dishes. 
- Our waiter was bombarded with complaints from three consecutive tables. Its a shame, because the waiters are not to blame.  However, they're the only ones guests can complain to. It was clear that there was no supervisor to help guide them.
- Currently, there's a \"Half Off Heat Wave\" promo going on where guests pay 50% off regular hours... overheard that the promo was implemented due to unhappy and leaving customers. Don't know if it's true, but I'd believe it. 

Overall...pretty much on par with Golden Corral."}
{"text":"Dinner buffet during the week is 23.99 with rewards card. Why do I feel ripped off? The food is average at best. What irks me is tipping the waiter for bringing me a glass of tea and clearing my table when I am done. If you are hungry either go outside the casino and eat or go to the food court. You'll save money....The food leaves you unsatisified."}
{"text":"Not usually a fan of buffets, but we were at the casino and dining options seemed a bit limited outside of the food court and Hard Rock Cafe. So we opted to try The Spread Buffet. We were pleasantly surprised with the food quality as everything was freehand high quality offerings. Price was a bit steep at $25 a person, but it was worth it if you knew what to go after. The salad bar was fantastic, with homemade dressings. An A+ for buffets as far as I'm concerned"}
{"text":"This buffet has managed to go from one of the premier dining experiences to one of disappointment. It's been a few months since I've been here, but I've eaten at the buffet several times since opening. I was blown away by the filth on the warming tables and the lack of caring by most of the workers. I remember the chefs being very warm and inviting. The rest of the staff would work diligently to make sure we had a pleasant experience. This isn't the case anymore. 

We waited 45 minutes to get in on a Monday. Many of the dishes were empty as we walked around. Perhaps they were severely under staffed at the time we dined. On a good note, our waiter was helpful and kept our drinks refilled."}
{"text":"Welcome to American gluttony. Breakfast buffet for $10. Typical breakfast food and Omelette station. Everything was fine and food was above average. Scone and croissant were nice and not too dry. Service somewhat slow for drinks but waitress was really nice towards the end. Waited in line to get in the buffet and it wasn't busy. Bathroom on this floor was not a tidy and clean as I'm used to. I'd come back especially after all night at the poker room. I'll review again when I come back for lunch and dinner."}
