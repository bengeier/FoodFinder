{"text":"Ok , I just gave this dominos a second chance .  The chicken wings were so small and the worst I've ever experienced , beyond small and all fat .  Disappointed  but it's a fast food pizza joint,  I know .  Pizza was two stars and edible , wings went into the garbage. ;("}
{"text":"salty, greasy pizza with clueless staff. This desi lady told my friend the price of small pizza so he decided to order. While they were preparing, the lady kept looking at us the weird way. When my friend went to the counter to pay for it, he looked confused. We realized she misinformed him about the price. He told me if I wanted to share and I said \"Heck no\" because I could literally see the pizza sliding left and right inside the box because the bottom was drenched with oil. I told him the pizza looked trash and he said it's also too salty but my poor buddy had no choice but to put it in his mouth because he was starving. rip"}
{"text":"Great disappointment.  I lived off of Domino's pizza in college.  Just discovered they're now delivering in Cave Creek.  Holy shit! Placed an order and waited nearly 45 minutes before calling -- and having someone telling me that I couldn't be found on some sort of Apple gizmo.  I fired back, WTF, Google Maps, you jerks.  Didn't register with even the franchise owner, who seemed startled and dumbfounded.  Here's my advise -- steer clear of Domino's.  It was great in the late 1900s, but it truly stinks in 2018.  You can do better.  Barrio's.  Pizza Hut.  Both are more reliable than Domino's.  They've trashed their reputation.  They now officially STINK!"}
{"text":"This was the worst customer service I have ever had. I ordered wings and pizza for my boyfriends birthday and the pizza toppings were wrong and I got saugy wings that are in a puddle of grease. This was the worst dominos experience I have ever had and an even worse experience with customer service. After reading comments I can now see this is an ongoing problem that desperately needs to be fixed."}
{"text":"first time i called this location the lady in the phone had a language barrier i had to hang up and call a different location and beg them to deliver to me. Tonight i called a second time and ordered. Hour later i called store asking if driver left and they said he did. 20 min after that phone call the driver calls me asking me where my building is. I told the driver he's a bad delivery driver if he can't find my building himself like use google maps what the hell.... anyways i end up calling the store again because the driver is taking forever to find my building. Finally the delivery arrives and i immediately notice my desert i ordered is not present. The driver leaves to go get it and again takes for ever like he must have parked far away even tho there's parking at my building. I notice during that time my pizza is not what i ordered and had a different address on the box. I call the store a third time and tell them. When the delivery driver arrives back at my door with my desert i give him the pizza back. The driver again leaves to his car and comes back with my cold ass pizza. I lie to the guy and tell him the store is giving me the pizza for free and close the door in his face. The guy calls the store and finds out i lied and knocks on my door repeatedly making my dogs bark. I don't answer as let's be real the order should be free. I later eat my cold pizza and notice this false advertisement on the box. HORRIBLE LOCATION TRY TO AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COSTS!"}
{"text":"Worst service. Pizza delivery took 2 hours. Was wrong. Took another hour to correct and send out. Pizza had no cheese. This location is the ultimate failure."}
{"text":"Ordered through the app and left the house right away. It was ready upon arrival. Very friendly workers who greeted me upon entering. Pizza was great! Great location!"}
{"text":"I dont expect much out of pizza places. Amongst the three on front street Domino's is hands down the best. Their menu is extensive and the alfredo sauce options make life worth living.   Today after six months of no pizza diet I decided to cheat and order a pizza. Sadly it was really dry and not as I expected. I took it back and the employees were super nice about it and made me a new one. I didn't walk in expecting this...thought I'd have to fight for pizza but hey here I am waiting for a fresh new one    All the pizza win."}
{"text":"Love Dominos. Can always count on a good pizza at a good price. With some garlic sauce it just makes the pizza so much more. Wish it would just come with the pizza like papa johns. But that's just being picky. Garlic bread is also very good. Add garlic to everything it's just better. Delivery time is always in its window so you can count on your pizza at that time!"}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese pizza and This is what I was given and they blatantly told me it wasn't burnt. Please what do you call this? (See attached photo)"}
{"text":"Ick. Will never order from here. Wings were a terrible gooey mess of undercooked fat."}
{"text":"Ok. I know what I'm getting but this Dominos is consistently good. Great prices. Great customer service. My boys love their pizza. Thank you for delivering to my house when others won't (wouldn't order from them anyway). Thank you!"}
{"text":"So it's raining, I didn't feel like going out.    I made the mistake of ordering from this location.     The store is literally 200m or less from where I live so how long should it take?   Keep in mind it was a tough order, a medium pepperoni!    Well it was about an hour and 10 minutes.     The pizza was cold and dry.    Does this alone deserve one star?   Nope.    The rude response every time we called to figure out what was going on.  Eventually the person on the phone hung up on my girlfriend.  I had to take the pizza back to the store to get a refund as they couldn't process it over the phone and they couldn't send the driver back as the manager wasn't around.    Ridiculous.   Our love affair with dominoes is over.    Never had this problem with the Bathurst location."}
{"text":"I know this is a chain pizza restaurant...but their pizza is consistently good!       And they finally opened up at 344 front street west!  Which is just about 2 doors west of Pizza Pizza and across the street there is Pizza Nova.     That's a lot of pizza competition, but that's okay....because both hubby and I would still go get Dominos when we can.   Why?  Because it's just better pizza.     The new store is very pretty!  New Domino chain layout.   The new stacked pizza ovens means they can churn out pizza's quickly, to meet the demand especially during roger centre sports and events.   They also have a sitting area on the 2nd floor....which is the first time I've seen a chain have upstairs seating for takeout and delivery.     My hubby has been looking forward to them opening for a very long time....and finally it's here!  He likes to get a large pizza usually with two kinds of toppings....as well as usually Parmesan cheese bread bites.  My dog loves pizza as well (mind you what dog doesn't? )  :-)   Fast service, beautiful new store, walking distance ...not much more then I can ask for."}
{"text":"This Domino's location doesn't even deserve a star. I placed an online order and was excited to eat the thin crust pizza. It's usually good, and very saucy.   The pizza get's made in under 10 minutes (wow). The quality check took over 20 minutes, and the delivery took even longer. I called the store, and they said the pizza left the store and it would be there soon.   I'm patiently waiting, and nothing... FINALLY my driver calls me and is parked at the wrong location. I gave him directions and he still couldn't figure it out. I left my work and said I would meet him on the street, he parked his car on the other side of the street and expected me to cross 6 lanes of crazy traffic on Bay in order to get the pizza. I said I won't do that, please come to my side. I paid for delivery, and so It's only fair.   He was very rude and finally came to my side. I took my pizza back to work, and when I opened it, it looked gross. It looked like delivery pizza that you put back in your fridge. It was SO COLD!!!!!!!!!! I took a bite and was so upset. I called the store and the guy kept making excuses, I didn't want my money back or a free pizza, I just wanted some proper customer service. NOPE! This guy could not care less. I was beyond disappointed and as I'm writing this review, I feel so sick. I took a picture and a video of my cardboard pizza so you can see for yourselves.   This was the worst pizza delivery experience I've ever had, I'm going back to Pizza Nova.   DON'T EAT HERE!   Angela"}
{"text":"The guys who work there are nice as can be. They provide decent customer service. However, I have a problem. Wanted chicken as one of my  toppings on my 3 topping pizza coupon. Sad to find out they are the only Domino's that consider chicken, Philly steak, and who knows what else, as 2 toppings. I verified with other Domino's that they only count it as one, as it should be. How can you consider one topping as 2? Taking advantage of location and people like that is a sure way to lose business."}
{"text":"Ok so here was my order.  1 large pizza three toppings 1 cheesy bread with marinara dipping sauce 2 garlic sauces    Absolutely terrible service here! Pizza came cold. And was over cooked. Order was wrong not once but twice. They forgot the marinara. Best part was when I called in and told them the error they promised to have a new one out in a bit which was another hour. It came ice cold and once again they delivered to me (after I called in and numerous times explained why I need the marinara sauce) two garlic sauces. It's frustrating knowing the person they hired to take orders has no idea how to listen. Honestly will not ever order from this dominos again. Too hard to get what I want and there's zero quality control I guess.    Try calling another dominos if you need some good food."}
{"text":"My kids love Dominos pizza especially when they have friend for sleep over. Not too far from us and easy for us to pick or get delivery. Good customer service."}
{"text":"This place is disappointing for a brand new franchise. You would think after investing all that money they would want to hit it out of the park. The quality of the ingredients is sub-par but worse than you would except from a Domino's. I ordered the thin crust pizza and it came out like a giant cracker. Possibly one of the worst pizzas I've ever had. Zero reason to return or order from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered online for delivery to my hotel and this Domino's was the \"caretaker\" since it was the closest at just under a km away. According to the tracker, the pizza was out for delivery at 9:11 and marked as \"delivered\" at 9:20. Unfortunately, I was in the lobby waiting at 9:20 and no pizza was there. By 9:30 I called the store to find out details on the delivery. Person on phone said it would be there in 10-15 minutes. It showed up 5 minutes later and was barely luke warm. No apologies from the driver. Further, no napkins or plates or plasticware were included even though they knew they were delivering to a hotel. Pizza fine other than being barely warm."}
{"text":"Pizzas are consistent with other locations, but delivery times have doubled to tripled ever since we got moved into their \"zone\". Now that it takes 60 to 90 minutes for delivery, I'm switching back to the faster alternatives."}
{"text":"Ordered an extra cheese. Pepperoni/ chicken pineapple pizza. Pizza arrived 15 minutes late. And not only that. There was so few toppings on it. Literally a few pieces of chicken and pineapple.  Never again ordering from here ."}
