{"text":"Ended up here with a family of ten for a Sunday lunch because the one next door (Alton tower restaurant) had a line up. BIG Mistake!

Food 4/10
Service 0/10

Very rude and impatient waitress.

Oh well. It'll be our only visit. I highly doubt the restaurant owner care anyways.

Sad that it gets the leftover guests from the restaurant next door."}
{"text":"Classic small chinese restaurant, the ones with only handwritten chinese specials on the walls. Service was attentive, food came fast. 14 bucks for double lobsters cooked to perfection, sweeeeet! Baked chicken was something new and neat. Extra star for the value and effort in offering slightly different items. 

Enjoyed the food. Would recommend and come again."}
{"text":"To be honest, my GF and I were both very skeptical abou this place when we first drove past it, but I'm glad we took our chances and gave it a try.  This place is usually very busy between 6:30pm to 8:30pm and it's next to impossible to find a seat during those hours so be warned!!!!

They offer double lobster for a low low price of $13.99 (dine-in only) and has many other affordable options at $8.99 a dish.  \"Pick 3\" and \"Pick 4\" combos are also available at 20+ dollars (can't remember the exact amount) including rice.

As for the quality of their food, is actually very decent for the price you are paying.  The lobster was cooked to perfection, veggies were fresh, their \"salted steam chicken\" was great with no complains, but, their food does have MSG in it (I'm very sensitive to MSG) so I made a request to try eliminate/limit their MSG use on my dishes which they honored.  

Overall, I'm very satisfied with their food and service as well as their competitive pricing!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here on and off for years.  They have a good selection of HK and Cantonese dishes.

On our most recent visit, we stumbled across soft shell crab fried rice and we opted for buddha delight veggie dish and we received French toast for free.

The service is something to be desired..kinda why we shied away for a few years.  Happen to come back since I had a craving for their HK style French toast.

We'll likely be back again when we happen to be craving the soft shell crab fried rice.

For those of you that may visit, bring CASH with you, NO DEBIT or CREDIT  accepted."}
{"text":"It sucks. The taste of the food is never good and service is standard Chinese restaurant. The crowd is usually middle aged Asian people coming here for a cheap meal."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.  Almost six years since my first review of Best Choice.

I once again choose the popular Cantonese  Chow Mein to see how things have changed or stayed the same since then.

I must have gone during a lull in the kitchen as the dish came out in six minutes.

Given that the price ($9) hasn't changed in six years, it's not surprising that some quantity has been cut and some component items have been removed.  There's no longer bamboo shoots and waterchestnuts and the roast pork is now slivered instead of having whole pieces.  I did manage to find one piece of scallop and a few shrimp.  However the highlight would be the chicken breast pieces which were super tender and flavourful. The squid was also nicely tender.

I would have preferred more salt and/or MSG to bring out more flavour but that's just me.

It's nice that Best Choice did not go the lower component quality route and I know their low prices have allowed them to continue to survive since the Great Recession but I'd rather they raise their prices and increase the quantity of their toppings.

Overall not a bad dish but it could have been better.  I'd probably try a dish with their chicken breast as the main protein next time."}
{"text":"On a near-empty Tuesday evening, I decided to give Best Choice a try. Upon entering, one server tends the entire dining area and I am seated next to the window. This place is very clean.

A typical Chinese joint, this establishment offers a variety of Cantonese/HK dishes. The menu is endless and offers a variety of flavours. I found myself rereading it, hoping I didn't skip a favourite dish. 

What stood out is the large selection of Daily Specials. A double sided page with dishes priced at $6.99. I ordered Sweet and Sour Pork and Eggplant w/ Pork. The Eggplant dish was on the sweet side but the SS Pork was spot on. It retained crispiness and covered in a standard sweet-sour sauce. The eggplant dish was unexpectedly on the sweeter side. Had it not been for the delicious SS Pork and ridiculously inexpensive fare, I would have rated 3.

Although not the best choice, this place is definitely a good one.

Try this place out if you want a bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Went for family dinner.  Food was surprisingly good.  Lots of dishes under $10 - which is hard to find now a days.  Also pretty good wok hay.  Food came quickly.

Pea shoots were fresh and tasty.  Taro duck - taro was soft and nicely done.  Salt pepper pork chop was a good size portion and meaty, not just fatty bits.

Free soup and heaping bowls of rice.  Overall, good value and efficient service.  

\"Gift card\"/ credit given for next visit.  Good place to go for cheap family dinner.  Lots of cheap set dinners and choices under $8.  

Appears to be a local neighborhood place.  Unpretensious food and service.  Would definitely return again for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Yum yum!!!! from Nelson's Ridge in Buffalo to another local chinese joint at Alton Tower's plaza.  Ive been here for their lunch specials that includes a fixed menu served with soup and tea at an affordable price but never for dinner.  Though there were plenty of other restaurants in the vicinity, Best Choice Restaurant was packed!  The service was fast, friendly, and efficient.  The servings were bang for its buck! well worth it!
we ordered

Fish and Tofu Hot Pot 5/5: healthy, hearty, and lots of gravy

Sweet and Sour pork chop 4/5: lots of tender pieces served with sauteed onions

Spinach with enoki Mushrooms 5/5 well cooked, portion, healthy choice, and not yum

General Tsao Chicken: 3.5/5 served beautifully on a bed of broccoli, the chicken pieces were perfectly cut, however the Red vinegar was overpowering.

overall 
4.5!!"}
{"text":"Best Choice is my type of neighbourhood family restaurant.  Upon entrance, you would see strips of colour paper on every wall.  This is a silent announcement that says \"we are inexpensive\" and more often than not \"we are authentic\".  Best Choice stays true to both.  The Stir Fry Spinach with Garlic tasted good, was well made with fresh spinach and insanely cheap at $7.99.  The Sweet and Sour Pork tasted decent and was insanely cheap at $6.99.  Th portions of both were generous.  A bowl of rice was $1.20.  I couldn't remember the last time I paid only $1.20 for a bowl of rice at a sit down venue.  So yeah, I would likely patronize again.

My regular dining standard isn't demanding.  If you have deserting tastes, please note that they use a lot of oil when stir frying.  They do use MSG, but it didn't seem excessive during my visit."}
{"text":"Certainly not the best Chinese in town, but if you want bang for your buck, this is the place, probably the reason there's a crowd at all hours of the day. I came during lunch, when cheap prices are even cheaper - and come with a free drink! Ordered the Yang Chow Fried rice, and got a serving big enough for at least 3 people for only $5.99! (See photo) Makes it hard to complain about quality when you feel like youre paying next to nothing for so much food."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday for dinner. I really liked everything we ordered here and the prices are really affordable. 

Fried green bean and pork minced pork $6.99 - tasted really fresh and appetizing. I could stop eating it.

Beef and onions $9.99 - generous portion of meat.

Duck and taro $9.99 - the flavours tasted good and once again generous portions of meat. Duck was nice and tender.

Meal comes with soup and sweet chestnut soup for dessert."}
{"text":"My in-laws decided to eat here for diner.  They enjoy coming here because it is conveniently located across the street from their apartment building. It is a small place and I feel it is always cold when I go there.  The food is ok but could be better. One of the dishes we ordered was fish fillet with king oyster mushroom and celery. There was a lot of celery but very little mushrooms.  However.   The price is very good"}
{"text":"Not my \"best choice\" for Chinese food in town, but my family and I eat here often because it's only a 7 min drive and its cheap. 

Food: Not going to go into detail what I had because I don't really know the names of what I had today LOL. Anyways, for typical Cantonese-style food, you really get value for your money. Many, if not all, of their specials are under $10 and come with a drink and soup. The menu is quite extensive but it's always good to bring someone who can read Chinese with you because there are many other deals on the walls as well. For lunch for a family of 5, we paid no more than $20 including tips and came out full. So price 5/5 but taste I'd give it a 3/5. 

Service: Service is okay. There was only 3 waiters working this Sunday afternoon where it was fairly packed. Although this one male waiter was a little on the klutzy side. Food came quickly as well. 3/5

Deco: Not the best I've seen but also not the worst. Could get some work done. I'm just satisfied that my plates and cups were clean in a Chinese joint. 2/5"}
{"text":"I really like this place for multiple reasons.
First off, before we even get situated and have a chance to look at the menu. Tea is served followed by a complimentary bowl of soup. I don't mean a tiny little  rice bowl of soup for each person. There was two of us and we got a big bowl of soup which gave us 3 rice bowls each.
We were there for brunch, so we ordered the lunch set meals. Baked Portuguese chicken, and scrambled rice and egg and beef noodles.
We both also got hot milk tea.
Once we made our order, they brought out a big piece of french toast. After splitting that and finishing it, we were almost already full. So, when our meals showed up, we were further surprised by how big the portions were.
The end total cost was less than $14 before taxes."}
{"text":"Best Choice Restaurant is one of those place that if you want to stuff yourself without paying a lot of money. 

I can tell you they do have their loyal followers when the restaurant is nearly full on a chilly cold weeknight after 9:30 PM. 

I ordered a Dumpling Noodle Soup. The portion is big... with tons of vegetables and 5 big fat shrimp dumplings. However, it was loaded with MSG! After I finished eating that my tongue was numbed for the whole night. 

I would not recommended Best Choice if you are really sensitive to MSG. 

The services were quick and friendly. 

CASH only!"}
