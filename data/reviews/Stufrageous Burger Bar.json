{"text":"I've been in two times so far and thoroughly enjoyed it both times. I got take out during lunch hour; the wait time wasn't bad considering that the burgers are made to order. The selection of toppings is good. The covered aluminum tray kept the food hot until I got back to work to eat. The burger was juicy and delicious and the sweet potato fries were too. If you like cheeseburgers, then you need to go in here and try it."}
{"text":"Went in recently with my daughter to try this place out. Was really disappointed in the layout at the counter, as it seemed like a subway display, only worse. Food was definitely outrageously expensive for portions that you get. Prices were definintely \"outrageous\", for what you get. Our burgers and fries came out separately. Their 'special store sauce' was disgusting. Restroom was clean and there is cute decor, but we definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"It really sure why there is hype around this place. Burger was relatively flavorless and the stuffings were barely warm. Ate half and gave the other half to a homeless person. Zero desire to return."}
{"text":"SO excited about this location! Often visited the Mesa location but it is far from where I live. This one is close and just as great! I love this place. The mac and cheese burger is my absolute favorite. Delicious, fresh and made to order. Will be in often :)"}
{"text":"I ordered from this place via postmates! I was getting home from work late and been wanting to try this place so I ordered it before I got home. By the time I got home and settled for the evening, my order arrives! I wish I had a photo because it looked so good. I ordered green beans and my burger had Mac n cheese in it :) dare I say more? I down that burger in less then 3 minutes! It was that good and I was that hungry. Their special sauce is delicious too! I forget what it's called but I think it's special sauce? Or awesome sauce? Delicious none the less. The buns were soft, meat was good, whatever else I picked to go inside the burger was yum. I kept it simple with the onion, lettuce, and even got jalapeños ;) 
I can't wait to come back here! I promise to take a photo next time. I am hungry just thinking about the burger I had."}
{"text":"Owner/Manager: There was no manager to support your new team. You had 1 girl with a few months of experience, but not a manager trying to keep confusion and chaos in order. You had a male (brother of manager or owner) who was doing his best, he was kind and apologetic, but stressed. Staff did great, the fault is on the lack of leadership to train and guide them. It was unorganized and the staff confused but doing their best to be discrete and fix. The number system to deliver food to tables was not working. Staff walked around trying to find who orders belonged to. Get tall numbers so they can see what table to deliver to. Burgers and fries came out separate. You must have a system in place at your mesa store, this store needs a better system. Orders took long, the girls on the grill got burgers confused, had to cut them and check, ask customers. There was nobody to manage and support, train and guide the team. I asked for the manager, no manager on duty. The staff hustled and did what they could. My 13 yr old daughter wanted to go behind the counter and help. 14 people in the location on 1/24 8:30 pm, most felt bad, frustrated but could see the effort and stayed, 1 couple got a refund. Don't dare blame the team, they tried, they were not ready to be alone. Food was good."}
{"text":"I'm batshit crazy about the mac burger. I literally crave it. Fries are good. Food comes out pretty quick."}
{"text":"Best burgers hands down ! I love this place because  you get to build your own burger kind of like chipotle with tacos. The stuffing options are unreal, no way you can go there and not drool over the options !"}
{"text":"Went today burgers were great! Different idea. Agree stuffing found just be in cartoon signage above on wall. Would make It easier as seeing food in plastic bins not as appetizing. However pleasantly surprised with burgers! This kid, juicy, and stuffings yummy! Better that toppings as they don't slip off top of burger. Agree all food better coming out together. Also would like sauces bar. Staff were very sweet and helpful . Food tasted great!!!!"}
{"text":"Stufrageous is a typical burger joint that stuffs a variety of ingredients into said burger. It's not a new concept but, it is very yummy. We've been here a couple times so far and we enjoy it."}
{"text":"Solid choice with a great concept and great food.  Get the Mac & Cheese customer favorite with bacon and jalapeños.  Family friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"So stinkin good. Everything about the meal was delicious. Ordered via Grubhub and the order was timely, fresh, and most importantly correct. The Mac and cheese will cure everything that ails you. Not a huge fan of their sauce but my friend loved it. On my list of favorites"}
{"text":"absolutely FANTASTIC!!! Such a warm welcome by the staff to set our experience off to a great start. The burgers are to dieeee for! Other favorites were the tempura green beans and the mac n cheese bites! Such an awesome modern twist on your average burger! 10/10, will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"A great burger filled with what ever you would like.   Great concept.  3 stars comes from the fact you need a full hour for lunch if their is a line.  If you are not planning on that you will be caught off guard."}
{"text":"A must stop whenever your in the Arizona area.  Definitely one of the better burger places I've ate, including the greater Northern California area.

Yum!"}
{"text":"What a surprise! I ordered the two different burgers to try it out. U can choose different toppings and choose between chicken and beef. Once u choose the toppings they stuff it in the beef or chicken which I thought it was super clever since it does not make much mess when u eat it. U can also choose ur buns and sauce to complete ur burger. The burgers were very soft and delicious. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is freaking ridiculous and I mean that in a GREAT WAY!!!! I know it's not the healthiest, I mean cmon it's cheese stuffed into a nice beef patty but wow it's so worth it! I can't eat it this all the time because of my healthy lifestyle but whenever a cheat day rolls around this is on my mind! I honestly recommend everything it's all so good."}
{"text":"This a great, casual place to grab a burger. They were delicious and we were still full hours later! Great and friendly staff, as well."}
{"text":"Good job Stufrageous! The burgers were great. Love the ability to choose toppings including the type of bun, all for no extra charge. The tempura green bean fries were delicious. And, not only are your burgers good and the concept cool, but you make life a little easier for those of us with kids in diapers. I really appreciate the thoughtfulness of a real changing table, disposable liners and baby wipes. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just went there for dinner it's okay but prefer In & Out. The format is strange and the display of items to use for stuffing wasn't presentable. I wish them well but probably won't return."}
{"text":"Went in the other night (and added the location to Yelp since it seemed to be missing). I had eaten at the other location in Mesa and liked it so I figured this one would be a safe bet as well and it's a bit closer to my place. The burger is good. It's not some amazing hamburger that's going to change your life, but it's good. What sets them apart is all the options you get with your burger. It allows you to really make a good burger way better and there are enough combinations of ingredients that you could go and get something different every time. 

The fries and shakes are also pretty damn good. Check this place out."}
{"text":"Yea!  Pretty damn good.  Yea, a burger is a burger... HOWEVER, you are able to choose your toppings... ALL INCLUDED IN THE PRICE.  Choice of buns.  Avoiding carbs, I did not try the fries and shakes.  Wish they had at least beer and wine.  A very clean, and comfortable establishment.

{"text":"AMAZING! Decided to check out the new location & it was just as wonderful as the first one in Mesa. Meat tastes fresh with great seasoning, the endless choices of stuffings is excellent, their tempura green beans are a must SOOO good! The Mac & Cheese with bacon & jalapeños is my favorite! To top it off you'll love their fresh baked cookies topped with ice cream! If you have yet to try Stufrageous, I highly recommend it, you won't be disappointed! For myself, I'll definitely be back!"}
