{"text":"Robbed us of time and money! Everything was ill prepared. Our party all ordered rare to medium rare steaks and it came out well done. The lobster was overdone, chewy, and tasted like eating a bottle of soy sauce. The scallops were rubbery and so salty I had to drink two glasses of water to wash the taste out of my mouth. The chef talked our ears off about nothing In particular and gave us a bad show. Will never return to waste money here."}
{"text":"Excellent food as always. It was a bit of a wait, but as always, it was worth it. I highly recommend the Teriyaki chicken or the steak     Kids loved it as well."}
{"text":"Love coming to Shinto. I always have a 5 star experience here. The food is great, and the chefs are always entertaining. Also a great place for parties and large groups."}
{"text":"I always look forward to going to Shinto's for some excellent hibachi when I'm in town.

I usually get the vegetarian option as it is always excellent but last time I got the shrimp and it was delicious! The hibachi, although pricey, is very good! It comes with rice, vegetables and meat, seafood or a vegetarian option. One in our party ordered fried calamari and it was too chewy so they sent it back and it came back a second time much better.

Presentation of the chef is great and they squirt some sake into your mouth with a bottle and flip shrimp into your mouth to see how many you can catch (I'm practically a seal, I caught at least 5 in my mouth!)

Service was a bit lacking--they didn't come often enough to refill or get you new drinks and the hostesses were a bit pushy--the other couple in our party were 10 minutes late and they asked us to call them to see when they would be there because the rest of the table was waiting on us. When we got to the table 3 minutes later, they hadn't even taken drink orders yet let alone were ready to start. I didn't really appreciate being rushed like that when they weren't ready to begin!

Anyways, all in all, a good experience and a lot of fun to visit in a large or small group!"}
{"text":"We had heard about this place for quite some time, and decided to make the 40 minute drive to check it out this week. Despite its location in a small strip mall, it was a fantastic experience!

The decor is modern and cool. Lots of options for places to sit depending on your liking- a bar, a sushi bar, hibachi, bar tables, and dining tables. 

They had a great wine list, and we were there on half price sushi night. Only the \"basic\" rolls were half price. We ordered quite a few of them and we're happy with all of the choices. Very good!

There are lots of sushi options around us in the Beachwood area, but we will make the drive to go to Shinto again."}
{"text":"Shinto is GREAT! love the food, the little Delicious is AMAZING!, it is Hibachi so it is a little more pricey but its worth it! Wait staff is really good! I couldn't believe how good the servers helped each other out. My server Donny was very nice. He was very busy but kept all of are drinks full and told some funny jokes. The managers where nice and Marco asked how everything was going and it was just an all around great time!  We will come back and tell our friends!"}
{"text":"We came here about 6 months ago and then again just the other night because we remembered enjoying it the first time. They raised their prices drastically, completely stopped serving noodles with hibachi, charged you $3 extra for rice (even though It's supposed to be included), and stopped serving sake. The cooks weren't even as fun as they used to be. We ended up paying $100 for a subpar meal for two people. Liked the old Shinto, but this time we were so displeased we will not be returning again. Wasabi on rte 18 in Akron is much better."}
{"text":"Incredible food, awful service. Yet I'm still giving 5 stars...the food is that good!"}
{"text":"The place is misleading the Tuesday specials are a limited menu. They don't tell you that until they give you the bill, not while your ordering. The manager even gave me a \"sorry for your luck, you should have read the menu\" speech when I asked him about the bill. That really shocked me. Theirs way better places for sushi that actually explain the rolls you order in detail when you order them not just drop them off and actually explain and go over specials with you at the beginning of the meal. The food was good though. They're just crooks or complete amateurs at doing business"}
{"text":"I've lived around the country and had sushi everywhere. No where can compete to Shinto. Prices are fair, service is superb.  Hibachi is excellent. Cooks are well trained and knowledgable. One of the best restraints I've been to. A++++"}
{"text":"The half price sushi on Monday and Tuesday is a great deal and very good. The hibachi is delicious but it's really hit it miss with the chefs that cook your meal. My most recent visit was very boring. The energy and enthusiasm just wasn't there...it's all about the experience and I was a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"I love their hibachi and sushi. I've tried the other places in town but this is the best. The staff is top notch and Phil the manager is a great guy and very personable. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Shinto is always great. It's not cheap but the food is always top notch. Jimmy the sushi man is the best! I'm a big fan of the habachi."}
{"text":"I tried to love this place but I've had awful experiences every time ... Sometimes the food is fresh but other times its chewy and awful. I feel like the place is pretty dirty too... Every time I've been here the floors have been sticky. It might be what they are washing them with but I don't think so. Sakura down the street has much better sushi but lacks in the decor department. Sakura has also been fresh every time I've eaten there"}
{"text":"Service has always been good but the food is mediocre at best. I think there are way better hibachi places in the area. I hate how this places always feels so grimy and sticky."}
{"text":"The best sushi spot in ohio, hands down. Great menu and the customer service is so kind"}
{"text":"The bar is a lil slow but if your going to ask for a server,,ask for JAY SLEY. I dont know if thats his real name but we called him, \"J\" he was halarious, funny and on point with service. He hooked it up. I was on a date and he made me look like I OWNED the place. If it wasnt for him,, i dont know if she would have licked my sushi roll that night!  ask for the LIL D sushi roll too"}
{"text":"Best sushi ever.  The most fresh and clean tasting sushi around. I find myself daydreaming of this place at least once or twice a week. The drinks are phenomenal, I recommend the pink flamingo martini.  Not particularly impressed with the hibachi but it's just not the style I prefer to eat by. We've been trying to take everyone we know there!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place, the chefs are always fun and the steak is always cooked perfect"}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times throughout the last few years and have finally decided to write a review.  Today I went in with a friend and my young daughter for lunch. After waiting about 10 min we were sat in a near empty room surrounded by dirty tables. The hostess brought us a broken highchair ( the strap) and basically ran off. We went to ask someone else for a new highchair  and waited...and waited..and waited! All the while the place was pretty empty and we watched servers talking in the corner. So we decided to just leave. This is the 2nd time I have left due to lack of service. I gave it 2 stars because i do think they have decent sushi. This will be the last time I go to Shinto unless they actually begin hiring people that actually care."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!! Hands down my favorite  hibachi restaurant (and I've been to many.) Totally worth the hour drive to get there."}
{"text":"My family and I eat at Shinto about once every 2 months or so.  We have never had a bad experience there.  The food and service are consistently great!  The atmosphere is fun and upbeat.  At other restaurants, I often have to take some food home, but at Shinto, I just keep eating because it's that good...and before I know it, my plate is empty!  This is our favorite place to eat when we are in the mood for a lively dining experience.  We will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Shinto is a treasure tucked away in Strongsville.  It's only real downside is it's popularity.  It's always crowded, even on a Tuesday night.  If you can get passed the crowds it's worth the effort."}
{"text":"We had reservations for Fri night at 7 pm. Valentines eve. 
The food and service was great we were seated within 10 minutes. The chef bad bear was fantastic,funny and entertaining. The food was very good . Overall the service was great, the atmosphere was very nice and we will return for another visit in the near future"}
{"text":"My daughter went with a party of 9. 7 of the 9 have experienced vomiting, stomach cramps and diarrhea (they had all ordered steak) without going to a doctor my guess is food poisoning. Will not ever recommend this place or return to it. My family has gone a number of times in past and it seems to be going down hill."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. You really can't go wrong, although the snow mountain roll is by far the best"}
{"text":"Loud, greasy floors, overpriced. I've never heard of a hibachi charging to make fried rice. The waiter seemed nice but we couldn't hear a word. When we asked him to speak louder, he couldn't or wouldn't for some reason. I half shouted my drink order at him and he left. That's when I noticed the table was comically high as if serving as bib. Every single surface was slick or greasy or sticky.  Two of my party nearly slipped on their oily floor. I mentioned it within earshot of several hosts and waiters and not a single one did or said anything. We didn't stick around to eat. Apparently they told one of our party that it gets really loud on weekends. That wasn't loud?? It was also really hot and humid. Very uncomfortable. What a shame."}
{"text":"Confrontational Management! We came with 30 people tonight to celebrate birthdays, yet again. We were sat at 3 tables and had two different servers and 3 different chefs. 2 of the 3 tables had very poor service, from slow drinks and empty water to cold rice and dry chicken. When it was brought to managements' attention, the gentleman was incredibly confrontational which was completely out of line. We eventually saw another manager who attempted to smooth things over but they likely lost a large group of frequenters of Shinto."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place for sushi in the area. Great drinks & great food with a wonderful selection of unique sushi rolls. The hibachi area is right out in the middle of everything however, making the atmosphere of the entire area very loud. The \"private dining\" sushi area isn't private at all as all you can usually hear is the screaming and banging from the hibachi tables. Service is 50/50, some servers are fantastic, while others are not so great at getting drinks out to you, while they sit at the bar waiting for delivery. Overall, food is great, service not so much."}
{"text":"Five stars for their decor and basically being able to transport you from suburbia Strongsville to some swanky place in downtown Cleveland.  Four stars ONLY because I hope to go back and try out their sushi bar.

We went there for Valentines day with an 830PM reservation.  As much as it was PACKED full of lovers and families for that special day, it went incredibly smoothly.  We were seated with a few other couples and immediately asked for our drink order by a nicely dress gentleman with whom stuck with our table the entire time (which is nice because there were SEVERAL refills of spirits, waters and the like).  Our hibachi chef was incredible and was inviting and entertaining.  I had the chicken hibatchi and my boyfriend had the chicken and shrimp hibachi dinner.  The salad was delicious and the soup, even better!  Hibachi dinners tend to take about 1.5-2 hours and we ended up leaving around 1030PM.  It was my first time and I enjoyed every minute of this experience!  There are at least 8 huge hibachi tables in the establishment and the restaurant was at the perfect temperature with periodic breezes which kept the place and the patrons from overheating.  I am going back for my birthday!  I would say, for all the nay say reviews you may read, try Shinto out and form a great opinion yourself.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"This place has a great feel and style. The meal was perfect and the server's were wonderful. The experience was very pleasant and I will be returning again soon. You can order the sushi or have your meal prepared hibachi style in front of you."}
{"text":"Service was okay and food was good (drinks were a little slow coming from the bar to the hibachi grill area). We were a party of 9 and were charged a mandatory 20% tip. I have no problem tipping 20% for good service, and the service was not bad. The reason ii have given such a low rating was the bad business practice of forcing tip on an after tax dollar amount. All tips should be given on before tax. I am not tipping the state of ohio. WHen i brought this to he manager's attention, he basically said too bad and this is how all places do it. He did not really care. I will not come back based on principal. Plenty of good hibachi places to go to that will adopt proper business practices."}
{"text":"The Sushi is the best in the area. I lived several different cities and Cleveland's sushi selection is most certainly not good. This place is probably my favorite though. I don't like the hard booths they are uncomfortable but again worth if for sushi. I do wish they had better prices or at least like a half off special roll night. The wasabi is awesome you can tell its made their and its strong like it should be. Getting hungry just writing this review! I highly recommend Shinto for a clevelander looking for a great sushi spot."}
{"text":"I can honestly say this was the best customer service that I've ever experienced. Caylin was super friendly & very bubbly. She made my mother, sister & I feel right at home. She was always back to refill our drinks never did we go thirsty. The hibachi chief Gustavo, was also absolutely amazing, he had me and my family laughing the whole time. The fried rice, lobster, scallops, shrimp, vegetables & their soup was amazing (adding siracha to the soup made it superb). The sushi was also amazing. We are from out of town and I really wish we could just take this whole restaurant including staff home with us."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times.  Drinks and sushi are fantastic but a bit pricey.  Hibachi was noticeably LESS impressive than other places.  Other than a few basic tricks, they don't do any of the fun stuff I've seen at other places.  To be fair though, I've been here mostly for a lunch meals, so they might pare it down thinking people are in a hurry.

I gave this place 4 stars for the overall atmosphere and experience.  The servers were very friendly and helpful... each time providing very good appetizer, drink, or sushi suggestions.

I work in Strongsville and this is the only restaurant that is unique and worth driving out of you way for in the area... and that does count for something."}
{"text":"Our meal here was very good. Our server did an excellent job. Our hibachi cook very good. I have wasabi as my only comparison.  Portions were smaller than wasabi. I still brought food home, but not as much.  My chicken ended up on my son's plate although not a total loss,  they removed it from my bill, and gave me chicken to go. I appreciate that. A member of our party had a birthday,  no ice cream, or customary happy birthday. A member of our party left a jacket.  The manager quickly got it to us in the parking lot.  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"The food here is great but the prices are a bit high. It is sushi so that is somewhat to be expected but it's still something to keep in mind if you're thinking of stopping in for lunch or dinner. A meal for two, with the tip, cost a little over $40 so if you're thinking of bringing the whole family, plan accordingly.

Service was pretty slow, hence the 4-stars, and we ate here during late lunch hours when the restaurant really wasn't too busy so there really is no excuse for that.

Staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean which are always two of the big things I look for in a restaurant. All in all, I'd highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good Americanized sushi place. 

My husband and I are super fans of fresh sashimi and sushi so we thought we would give Shinto's a try (rated #2 best sushi in Clev). 

We usually order sashimi/sushi sets and add uni and some other fish that is not offered on the sampler. Drinks - hot sake and beer.

Shinto's did not have a sashimi/sushi set and they did not sell uni. Our waiter was awesome though and talked to the chefs about creating one for us. They put 2 types of ahi, salmon, tako, and hamachi. All were good but not great. For sake they only offered 1 kind, the house sake, which was also good. 

When asked where we normally go since our order was different...we didn't have an answer as we just moved back to Cleveland from Hawaii then Asia. His description of Shinto's was funny - it's the place people go who \"love\" sushi and they order some deep fried rolls with 6 sauces all over them. LOL! 

Like I said the dinner was ok, waiter was cool, atmosphere seemed nice if you wanted to go for happy hour and drinks...which I would totally do.

Our next stop is Tremont to try Ginko. We heard they have amazing sashimi and is a little more authentic."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why everyone is always raving about how great Shinto is.  The place is constantly jam-packed... not too sure why, because the food isn't like amazing, and it's definitely not a cheap place to eat.

They pretty much get 5 stars for their decor, and maybe a 3.5 start rating for their hibachi.  Their sushi is nothing to bat an eyelash at though... it's rather mediocre.  If I'm going to be paying this much for this quantity, it better be the best thing I've tasted.  I don't know though... too much rice in the roll last time I went.

In the end, it's extremely pricey.  It's nice if you're in the mood for the hibachi experience, but for sushi specifically, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"To be fair...my family and I have been here enough times now that the \"show\" part of the meal is not all the special to us, but we do keep coming back because we enjoy the quality of the food.

We usually do the hibachi meal and also order some sushi on the side.  My wife and kids are more of the sushi lovers and have always enjoyed their choices.  The hibachi style dinners are always nice and include soup, salad, vegetables, shrimp or mushroom appetizer, rice and a main meat.  Meals are always filling and of course we all LOVE the Yum Yum sauce,"}
{"text":"This is a review of my first dining experience at Shinto. Our chef wasn't terribly engaging and we didn't have a full table, so the whole thing was lackluster. The guy squirted sake into our mouths and got it all over our faces, necks and clothes, which was annoying.  But I loved the food and we had a pretty good waitress, so I can't give it a bad review. I liked it enough to actively want to go back again sometime. I had salmon which was cooked perfectly, and the meal (soup, salad, and teriyaki salmon with fried rice and mushrooms) was delicious."}
{"text":"I nice place to go and relax after work.  We mostly do sushi there, but have had the hibachi a time or two also.  For a quick drink & sushi fix, it's nice."}
{"text":"Awesome Food Experience and atmosphere and a must try.!! Menu prices a bit over priced. Sushi Chefs are Great and a must try.!! Will be back soon.."}
{"text":"my friend and I had a great time at Shinto. the Sushi was very good, the best I have had in the Cleveland area. the Hibachi was good and tasty but nothing truly spectacular."}
{"text":"Great place, much better than Samurai. Sure, the cooks are all trained the same and have been doing the same act for years. I don't care, it entertains my kids and they eat well in a nice place that I can order Sushi; that's a win-win. The sushi is always fresh and great tasting and the hibachi food is great too. 

The atmosphere is fun and the staff does a great job."}
{"text":"I am new to the sushi game, but I loved this place. It was not too pricey, and the servings were good. I got the shrimp tempura roll, and another roll with spicy craw fish on top. It was yummo!!! I recommend this place. The service wasn't too bad, but I didn't go there for the service. All in all I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice but the service is horrible.  The food is good but can get better at Tomo a half mile north...and a lot less expensive!"}
{"text":"We had friends in from California and brought them there to show them Cleveland can do sushi just as well As Cali! They loved it! We had a great experience from the food to the waitress! Couldn't have asked for me! They loved it too!"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch on a saturday, after shopping for Prom dresses. The sushi is amazing, and the chefs interact with everyone around the table. Big portions, and very delicious food. I would def recommend this place."}
{"text":"Reviewing the Sushi* From someone who works at a 5 star sushi restaurant.* 

For the price, it's a magnificent ripoff.
The nigiri is cut paper thin, unlike other sushi bars i've been to where you're served an actual cut of fish. If you're paying $5-$8 for two pieces of fish, give me an actual ****ing piece of fish. 

Sushi rolls were good as far as flavor, but again, $16 dollar special rolls cut very thin and not much in regards to portions 

Fish was fresh though, which is good. 
Rice was laughably bad though, which is not so good. It was dry, not very sticky, and had no flavor to it. 

tl;dr
Learn how to cook rice, dont skimp on portions of fish, stop putting cream cheese in 80% of your rolls, and learn how to make a decent rainbow roll."}
{"text":"This once was my favorite restaurant. I've been here 10 times & each time the service has gotten worse. After this last time, I will never go back. The staff (excluding chefs) is rushed and very rude. Our party of 9 waited 50 mins past our reservation time to be sat-- even when we were all there before our reservation time. Our reservation was at 7:30 and we finally ate just before 10pm. Our appetizers came out after our food was prepared. The manager was not very sympathetic. The food was just okay. Its very expensive. Don't waste your time or money here. The staff is terrible. It's a shame because this once was a great spot."}
{"text":"Really like and enjoy this place, it's great food and entertainment all rolled into one.
The food here is really fantastic at a great price and then on top of it they entertain you with a great experience with their chefs preparing the food right in front of you in an entertaining, fun way which makes for a great experience all the way around.
Very reasonably priced, very tasty and very entertaining. I honestly don't know how they do all they do for the price they do it for."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. The food is superb as well as the service. The staff is always nice and polite. I love treating my mom to dinner here!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a negative score. Grocery store sushi for $50. Seriously done with this place. Rip off alert."}
{"text":"This is my favorite hibachi restaurant. You can always count on getting an excellent meal and great service at shintos! I always get a combination plate usually a filet and scallops. The filet is the best steak ever!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at Shinto! I love the Shinto rewards membership card! Drinks are a little high but they also don't skimp on the booze! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. The food is inferior and the service is terrible. We had a table of 15 colleagues and were 1 minute past our reservation on a Tuesday and they refused to seat us. Mind you it's a Tuesday and the place was empty. The manager was an absolute moron and did not give us any other option. Go to Samurai down the road next to the Costco. Better food and service."}
{"text":"Didn't have the hibachi since we came an hour before closing time.  Sat at the bar and they had every light on in the restaurant so they can clean and close early.  Very unprofessional for a restaurant and poor for the ambience...this isn't McDonald's.   My friend said their sushi was good so we came here for convenience.  I wish we just went to the Panini's down the street to be quite honest.  Very amateur signature maki rolls from what I'm use to.  Every damn roll was drenched in some kind of mayo sauce or was stuffed with cream cheese.   

Disappointing food and experience.  I will not come back here next time I'm in Ohio."}
{"text":"Consistently good.  Always busy.  My wife enjoys the sushi very much, and I enjoy the hibachi. They do it right here.  Wish however they would bring back the mustard sauce instead of the ginger sauce...it was so much better."}
{"text":"Went there with my buddy after work to try the 5 pound sushi challenge. Didn't eat all day to get ready. Sat at the sushi bar, our server was very nice and very interested in our endeavor as she never saw it happen to customers of hers. Waited a solid 15 minutes for the roll but when I saw it I understood. So big. The foh (front of house) manager came over to wish us luck and we were off. After fighting for a solid 45 minutes we failed. Yet we were allowed to take the remainder home. All in all it was a wonderful experience and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"We went last Friday without resos. Sat at bar and barely got served. After friends arrived moved to sushi bar where service was excellent. Sushi was excellent...bill was less than expected-overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Shinto has a great atmosphere and a lot of good meal choices. The sushi is outstanding; I personally think that it is the best in the area. The hibachi food is also outstanding. The chefs are entertaining. Great for families.
The atmosphere is clean and comfortable. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I tell all my friends that Shinto is the Hollywood of Japanese steakhouses.  

Don't get me wrong the food isn't bad, but I feel like it's more about the presentation than the food. I've been to almost every Hibachi Grill in Cleveland and I would say that Shinto is average at best. The prices are way too high. I could get the same thing at Tokyo in Medina or Arashi and Westlake for about $15 less (and better quality). I had a good experience but as far as hibachi grills go this one's right in the middle."}
{"text":"We had a great time and enjoyed the atmosphere. It is wide open with lots of Hibachi tables along with a massive Sushi bar. They also have a nice sized bar area while you wait. We walked up to the bar to grab a beer and the bar tender asked if the kids would like something, he made Shirley temples and noticed they liked the cherries so he gave them a little cup of extra cherries to eat. We waited about 35-40 min (no reservation, which I would suggest) and got seated at the table. The chef made small talk and really made an extra effort to have fun with the group. He even squirted lemonade in the kids mouths for fun. It was I nice evening and good food with great service."}
{"text":"Delicious food & awesome entertainment!!! Had a wonderful time. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I was a little concerned about how my experience was going to be due to the bad reviews but our experience was amazing! \"Mike Jones\" was are chef & he was awesome. He did all kind of tricks & had us entertained the while time. The food was fresh. We had a sushi roll & it was awesome too. I would definitely recommend \"Mike Jones\""}
{"text":"Took my grandson and his girlfriend here for a birthday lunch and couldn't have been more pleased, the food was excellent and our hibachi chef was great !"}
{"text":"Mike Jones was absolutely great and very entertaining. Felicia was also a fantastic server. The food was amazing. Always a great time every time I go there."}
{"text":"the manger phil is not a very good person to deal with he called me a liar on 3 times i called in and spoke to a young lady she told me i had a reward of a free roll  i got there and it was a different story  there website was down so i had to call in  to get card info well the mgr phill tells me he cant verify  anything and would not take care or help me in any way 

well i was a great customer even brought family in  but no more i will never be back and i am writing yelp and every other review site hint if a customer has a reward card that means they are trying to be a good customer  please educate your staff better on how to handle customer rewards cards i even tried to tell the mgr he should train them better so he dont  loose more customers me or my family will no not  spending any more cash with u all over 15.00 please train phil on how to talk to customer who are paying   half price tuesday are not the same any more nobody comes into your place anymore i can see why take care and tell phil i said hello"}
{"text":"I love the sushi here.  The rolls are large and tasty.  It's one of the few places in Cleveland where I think the sushi rolls are very good.  Cleveland seems to have an abundance of mediocre sushi restaurants.  I like traditional rolls but I also like the crazy insane rolls and they do both well here.  The sashimi specials are amazing, too, the portions are very generous.  My girlfriend is allergic to avocado and we always ask for all our rolls to come with avocado on the side and we have never had one problem or allergic reaction.  So why not five stars?  It's just so loud.  You can't really have a romantic dinner here.  We love the food but we're eager to leave the minute we've finished."}
{"text":"The food is always great and the cooks have a lot of talent! It's always fun to eat here with anybody, family or girlfriend.
This is a higher end restaurant. I'd recommend every once in a while events, like anniversaries because it can get expensive. Dress nice and have fun!"}
{"text":"Has declined over the years. My last 4 visits have been below par. Slow service with countless mistakes. Quality of food has gone down dramatically. Shocked at how poorly maintained and dirty everything is: dishes, windows, floors covered in grime and a layer of grease. Granite counters are broken and cracked. Far from a fine dining experience. Too bad it can not be the place it was when it opened."}
{"text":"Warning: If you plan to go to Shinto's in Strongsville, wear short sleeves because it is SO freakin' hot in this place when all the hibachi's are going at once. Yikes! I had to leave the table twice and go out into the 20 degree night just to cool off. Now that that's out of the way........

I do give this place an A for atmosphere because the interior is cosmopolitan with an Asian flair and is quite nice. There are about 8 -10 hibachi tables plus a large sushi bar plus a regular bar. 

First we ordered two drinks (a vodka cranberry and a Coronoa) and it came to 10 bucks. Whoa! Okay. Time to eat......

First course was a Mushroom Broth soup that was very hot, which made me even hotter. It tasted like very strong beef broth and had one mushroom floating in it. I didn't finish it. Then came a small house salad that was small but refreshing -- anything to cool me off a bit. Then came the bowl of fried rice. How different can fried rice be from every other bowl of fried rice I ever had.? Then came by shrimp that was prepared by the chef. It was good. By the time I ate a few my scallops had arrived and they were delicious after being sauted on the HIbachi. After what seemed an eternity, my vegetables came but by this time I was tired from being so hot. 

After about an hour, dinner was finally over and our bill came. For my son and I it was $81 total so with a tip it was about a hundred bucks. This was WAY too expensive for what we got. What it comes down to is that you pay for the experience. I wouldn't go back and I hear there is a better one in town that I'll try the next time I want Japanese food (which isn't very often)."}
{"text":"I think these types of places are really about the people that you go with. 

I was fortunate enough to come here with some great folks from work. It was the first time we all got a chance to hang out, and it was a great time.

I am always nervous about the chefs. Do they like us? Do they despise us? when they go back to the kitchen, do they make jokes about our dumb-ass white people behavior? I have no idea. It's almost worth it to learn Mandarin to find out.

Consipracy theories aside, this is a great place. One of our crew eats sushi on a weekly basis, and says that most everything off that menu is solid. As for the hibachi, I really like that style of food, with clean tastes and not a bunch of crap added. I don't think I can ever go wrong.

I like how the tables are all in one big room, open to the sushi and drink bars.

Try Shinto. It's not a bad idea to get out of the city now and again."}
{"text":"Walked in and the hostess was on the phone. Did she acknowledge our existence? Negative. Then when we said we didn't need to eat sushi, she treated us like it was a major problem. Ordered a drink, it was made well. Ordered appetizers and all were tasty. Now to the big disappointment. I ordered the teriyaki chicken dinner. Chicken was over cooked and there was not enough sauce in the dish. The ginger salad was nice but the chicken was so dry my mouth hurt, not to mention the hefty price for said chicken. Would have been 3 stars if we had better service."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner on a reservation for 8 pm. We arrived on time however, when dining at the hibachi tables, we had to wait for the rest of the reservations to show up and of course they were late. So our greeter took us to our seating around a well appointed hibachi grill where we waited again for our drink order to be taken. When I asked for more lemon on the side with my water I was given a large amount of lemons which was awesome! Then our chef arrived!!! He made up for the rest of the restaurant and if I could give him 10 stars I would! Sexy Andy put on the most Cash Money show I've ever witnessed! His moves were finessed and entertaining! I ordered the mako shark and it was made to perfection! He got me so drunk with his sake bombs lol!!! I recommend this place just have patience:)"}
{"text":"Delicious hibachi. Great service with very entertaining chefs.

Sushi is decent, if you are in Strongsville and looking for sushi, drive north on Pearl and go to Tomo"}
{"text":"Always a good meal and good time.  Ask for chef Mike Jones.  He is very entertaining and comedic.  Is very pricey but worthwhile."}
{"text":"Oh Shinto, you have so much potential. Sadly, your staff is going to be the thing that brings you under one day. 

I recently tried to order some sushi rolls for take-out over the phone, since I actually really do love their sushi even if it is expensive - hence why I gave them two stars instead of one. The hostess seemed less than thrilled to be stuck there at 1:20 on a weekday afternoon. After being hung up on twice, and maybe I should've taken that as a sign the big man upstairs did not want me to fulfill my sushi craving, I finally decided to call one more time. Well, I wasn't hung up on this time. Instead, I was put on hold for almost 15 minutes. While you might be reading this and saying, \"that's not thaaaaat long\", imagine walking into a restaurant. You FINALLY get a table after being ignored by the hostess for 5 minutes, but then no one greets you for another 15. You would either walk out and/or never come to that establishment again, no matter how good the food. But chances are, that wouldn't happen in a good restaurant with decent staff. Why Shinto feels that customers ordering carry-out aren't as important is beyond me: last time I checked, I have to pay for my food just like people dining inside. After all the frustration and time, I simply told her I had changed my mind, I'd rather take my money elsewhere. Big disappointment. 

Instead of paying for all these radio commercials I keep hearing this holiday season, maybe invest in some better waitstaff."}
{"text":"We decided to take the family for a special treat on a Sunday afternoon,  6 of us.  Made reservations and we were seated immediately.  Service was great and Big Daddy gave us a great show.  Having eaten at other hibachi's, I can only give Shintos a 2 for food.  Had the Jimmy sushi,  good but over priced.   I didn't care for the beef based soup which was all broth,  no mushrooms or green onions.  Salad with ginger dressing was exceptionally cold, almost frozen.  Had steak and lobster, average.  Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Always great food and good service.  The spicy crab salad is Boss.  The filet roll was good with just the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"Just OK! Typical Hibachi Grill, I like the showmanship for special occasions (birthday's, anniversaries) but for me I wouldn't go to a place like this at all!

The food is the same at everyone I've been to no creativity, nothing different, all tastes the same!

Our experience was good, food was just good, service was excellent and friendly."}
{"text":"I've tried really, really hard to like this place.  It is pretty close to home, seems to have most everything I would normally order and is squeaky clean.  

Let's start at the front.  Seven different nights, each time the same experience.  The woman (or women) who works the front as hostess could not be less enthusiastic.  When I was starting out in life I worked in a factory; she might consider that as her career path.  Dealing with the public for a living requires an interest in people, perhaps some charm, some tact, some...  I know!  Hospitality!  No matter if I'm with my wife on a date, with a group of friends or with kids the treatment is the same.  Blank stare.  Confusion.  Inability to perform the simple task of seating us.  That is no way to start a dinner.  On one visit with four family members, early in the evening, we asked to be seated anywhere.  The place was nearly empty, and it took a half hour to be seated.  Inexcusable.

The waitstaff, though, is far more consistent and far better at their job.  Very few problems in this area, and those so minor as to be forgiven.

The food is pretty good, although the sushi quality seems to yo-yo up and down.  When it's good, it's really the best around.  Why can't it always be that good, I wonder, if they use the same suppliers and vendors.  As with the aforementioned hostess issues, I think they have a management problem.  I'm not willing to spend any more time or money to find out if there are certain days of the week that are better than others.  

The bar is open, light and very singles-active.  Sometimes the music is pretty loud, but the whole restaurant theme is pretty loud, too, with the \"theater\" of hibachi cooking stations.  Later at night, it is VERY loud, but still manages to be a lot of fun.  We see lots of party groups there, and the chefs appear well-trained and professional.

I see from their website that they have another location in Naperville, Illinois, so perhaps this is a chain, or owned by a chain.  It does have that \"we'll never have to see you again, so here's the grub\" attitude, for the most part.  (There is another sushi place around that greeted me by name on my SECOND visit, so it is possible, FYI.)  I wonder if they don't have the restaurant as a front for all those martini-sipping schmoozers to pretend they aren't just hanging around a bar.  \"Honey, I'll be home late.  Just stopped with some colleagues for a bite of sushi.\"

My recommendation would be to invest the half hour they make you stand around waiting to be seated, and DRIVE a half hour to a well-managed, consistent sushi restaurant.  If you've read this far, you know a few that you already love."}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times, and didnt realize how disappointing it was until I went to other hibachi places (Samurai, benihana, a few others). My most recent trip made me decide to never go back. I had gotten a promotional email from Shinto about $12 hibachi on Tuesdays. Turns out, thats a lie! The waiter said he had no idea what I was talking about and would not honor it! (I even had the email message with me. Their \"specials\" were completely different than the email I had just received 2 weeks prior).  I went with a friend, and we decided to have hibachi anyway. Theres an extra charge for fried rice. So my disappointment was mounting, but what finished the deal was when the chef did no real \"show\" for us. He did not do any of the mouth catching tricks, where he tosses broccoli/chicken/etc at you to catch with your mouth. Did no tricks with the eggs. Just cooked in front of us, plainly. Are you kidding me? Food was decent, but nothing special. Dont waste your time here. The only good things here (mostly the atmosphere/decor) can be found anywhere else for a better price and better service."}
{"text":"Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. I have been to many hibachis and the menu here was extensive. Not just steak shrimp chicken. They hadn't swordfish, shark, and other exotic stuff. Lots of food. I was stuffed on my $23 swordfish."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for Valentine's. Great customer service, excellent food and clean environment. Best sushi!!!!!  I was so excited they made the Lil Delicious, my favorute sushi roll. My husband even tried sushi for the first time and enjoyed their shrimp tempora roll. It was a 45 min drive from where we live but we'll worth it."}
{"text":"Went with four people tonight because we had some gift cards.  Had reservations for 6:30, they still made us stand around until 6:45 with no one else being seated and then gave us a table three feet away that had been sitting empty the entire time.  Pretty dark and a little hard to hear.  I had the Sushi & Sashimi Combo, the others had hot dinners.  One piece of crab on my dish was exceptionally good, the rest of the fish was OK but not outstanding.  Service was good.  Everyone sort of enjoyed the meal but there is no reason to pay these prices for the quantity and quality of food that you get."}
{"text":"Shinto's is a really nice Hibachi grill. They have some interesting menu items and drinks, along with the more traditional dishes. I personally go there for their half off sushi nights and the half off appetizers! The menu can be a little pricey so the half off nights make it just right! They make the sushi right there in front of you and you can taste the fresh difference compared to other sushi. The hibachi grill menu is good and the flair when cooking is a nice touch. I like it when the chefs' fling the shrimp at your face so you can catch it with your mouth! The patio is ok, but that is not their main focus. The inside of the restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the staff is usually very hospitable. All in all, it is one of my favorite Strongsville locations!"}
{"text":"Great food! I can't remember the name of the sushi roll we ordered but it was one of the house favorites! Definitely worth a try. Great service!

We went back as a group of 5 and sat at a hibachi table. We have each been to hibachi restaurants 7+ times, but our chef Oliver Queen (pictured) found a way to make it even more fun and entertaining! Request him as your chef!!"}
{"text":"The food, the staff, and the experience is always on point at Shinto! You can't go wrong with anything that you order; from drinks, to sushi or hibatchi, it's all above and beyond any other place I've been to. My favorite sushi is the little delicious roll or the Keller roll. Hibatchi gives you sooo much food!  I'm not even mad about eating these leftovers for days after my visit."}
{"text":"Tonight the whole family came. We took up both grills. The manager did a nice service recovery because my nephew when we first arrived touched the grill and thought he burned his fingers. The lady came out with some options on how to take care of it. That was really nice. The whole time we were there while the guy was cook, he kept asking if we need anything. I really enjoyed that. With being how busy, Kayla was pretty attentive and took care of us."}
{"text":"Always a great experience. We went there to celebrate my mom's birthday and were treated very well. The food is always very tasty without being overly salty or oily. Our server Bren was very attentive and the cook very entertaining. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Oh Shinto. I do love me some Sushi, and a couple times a year I do like to do the whole Japanese Steakhouse thing. And Shinto is definitely one of the better places to go for that. I don't really have anything to say that hasn't been said before in reviews on here. Mike Jones is the best chef! And for sushi The Little Delicious and The Guatamlean Rolls are absolutely delicious! Super glad that their specialty rolls are on special on Monday & Tuesdays because normally they are on the more expensive side. But you get what you pay for, and their sushi is delicious."}
{"text":"We did not try the hibachi here just normal table for some sushi. First turn off point was a cup of hot tea with  \"teabag\"! Never seen that before at an Asian restaurant. The combination of a teabag and the white cup reminds me of Denny's! 
We are hard core sashimi eaters. Generally when we order 4 Salmon sashimi (total of 8-12) pieces and 2 order of tuna sashimi (4-6) pieces, the chef would guess that we know our fish so they tend to give us a mix of high/low fat salmons. Not here, the pieces were all closer to tail and darker meat. Lastly the pieces of sashimi are half the size of sashimi I had ever seen; way too small (see picture)
The onion soup was good!"}
{"text":"I was originally going to call this sushi restaurant  average, but in truth, it's less than average. I didn't have a bad experience, just a profoundly disappointing one. The problem is in the fact that it is extremely expensive relative to the price of the food. I don't mind paying real money for food, but I resent getting ripped-off. The sushi was at best a grade below what you would find shrink-wrapped at the Giant Eagle. The service was fine, the atmosphere was loud but cheerful, but I just can't get over the over priced food."}
{"text":"Went for lunch , the staff was ok but the sushi was disgusting , they usually have good food there but this time wasn't that great"}
{"text":"Excellent service here especially Kaylyn! She was very helpful in taking time to explain the menu and some of the restaurant favorites. She knew I was a first timer and treated me with kid gloves. 

The downside was that the sushi was average at best. I can't recall the name of the rolls I had but the flavors didn't blend well. it seemed like they were trying to make some \"hip roll\" with all this stuff that no other sushi bar has. I think that's why no other sushi bar has it because it doesn't taste good. 

They also have other food choices as this is a Japanese steakhouse and has a Benihana like dining style which seemed to be fun as I saw the chefs performing tricks with guests. Looked fun but I sat at the bar. 

I won't rule this place out because the service is great. I think I just didn't pick the right items off the menu. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is fair.   Lobster was overlooked. Food is fair.  However....not enough air conditioning and if you are wearing heels, you can barely walk because the floor is slippery.  Either from grease from hibachis or the product they are using to clean floors. They have a sign stating floors are slippery when humid  I'm sure to avoid a law suit. Never noticed this before when I visited on prior occasions."}
{"text":"Shinto and Sushi Rock are the best in Cleveland for sushi as far as I'm concerned. However, Shinto was a much more convenient location for me, so I've been there many more times and do prefer it. I've ordered sushi here 25+ times, and been to the hibachi 2.

FYI If it's on the menu, it INDEED is REAL sushi contrary to some of the other review commentary I've read. That being said....The Little Delicious and the Miso Surprise are the best of the best in my book. Tough to beat anywhere I go. The miso soup is always good. Good flavor. And finally, the edamame always comes out fresh and as expected.

The hibachi is pretty standard, but the sauce mixed in with the rice is awesome! I've ordered their rice many times, just to get that sauce."}
{"text":"AMAZING, I honestly have never had s bad experience here. I would highly recommend the chicken steak and shrimp on hibachi. The only issue is there is almost always a wait but that's to be expected with the type of restaurant."}
{"text":"Solid hibachi fun! The entertainment is more than half the reason to dine. The hibachi food was standard but their sushi takes their score from an average 2.5 to a solid 4!

I read a few reviews knocking the sushi but what I was served was solid. I'm guessing they made some changes."}
{"text":"Staff was great; they were talkative, friendly professional, and thoughtful. The place was incredibly clean, and a casual Saturday afternoon felt like a nice Friday night dinner due to the subdued lightning and warm ambience of the place."}
{"text":"Still really good! Went here on a Monday, discounts on drinks and certain sushi. Love the Little Delicious, you have to try it! I think it's worth the drive, especially if you go to the mall right down the street."}
{"text":"Adequate sushi but nothing great.

Slightly pricey, food was good to okay. If you're looking for something different in Strongsville then try it. Be prepared for $75 for dinner and drinks for two.

Service was good but not noteworthy. Sushi was better than the hibachi."}
{"text":"Shinto has the best Sushi in Strongsville.  Even better is Wednesday night happy hour where the best appetizers and most of the appetizers are half off.  Usually I order the salmon wrapped asparagus & vegetable tempura for the appetizer and Guatemalan + Ohioan rolls for Sushi.  After that, I leave a happy person"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. Slow and generally confused waiters/waitresses. Mediocre sushi overall. Had a fresh taste but was poorly prepared and the pieces were very small. Not acceptable at these prices. Hibachi steak was fatty and of very poor quality. Scallops were almost paper thin. Terrible terrible terrible portion sizes. Overall an absolutely pitiful experience considering our check topped $100 for two people. You can get better for you money than this."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in the area! Tasty cuisine for reasonable price. Definitely visit this place!"}
{"text":"So I came not to sample their Hibachi grill food or loud chiefs. I came on Tuesday night for their half price sushi night. Sushi is one of those things that cost a lot of wallet pain here in NEO. So any percentage off is good percentage off. Especially, 50%. 
They are set up mainly for \"steakhouse\" grill dining. So the area reserved for \"a la carte\" dinning is small and really insufficient for a party larger then 8. There is patio dinning available. Apparently, they've also recently installed a sushi bar so side by side dinning in front of a stranger preparing you raw meal is possible. 
I loaded up on my usual favorites, sashimi (tuna and salmon), sushi including, squid, white tuna and yellow tail and a spicy tuna roll. A friend also ordered \"little delight\" to share.
I would say that the sushi and sashimi were fresh and pretty standard (rice don't fall apart when picked up with chopsticks. Fish pieces does not smell like they've been around the block a few times). The rolls were fine. No ugly surprises nor was it absolutely fantastic. Except for the \"little delight\". It's  not little but sure is delightful. It is kinda of pricy though. 
One good note: they do have Asahi beer 
One bad note, they included tips in bill automatically. Silly Shinto, if you only know how much I tip. My waitress would be ticked if she knew what I was prepared to give until i saw it in bill. My tipping motto if you decide for me you get what you asked for."}
{"text":"I love the little delicious! It is nothing like real sushi but damn is it good!!!!! 
I have always had excellent service at this establishment! I have been the the hibachi and the chefs are extremely entertaining and talented! 
The atmosphere in here is cool! It is very different with the sushi bar in the middle, the bar to the side. It's \"hip\"... Stupid way of describing it but it is!! 
Last I heard, they still had half price sushi on Tuesday and (my favorite) half price bottles of wine on Thursday!! 
The only reason this place is missing the fifth star is because there is NO way you can get out of here cheap! It is rather pricey!"}
{"text":"Shinto, Shinto, Shinto oh how I love Shinto. I've been frequenting Shinto for years and it is always a great time. From the sushi to hibachi and everything in between all of the food is always amazing. In addition to the normal dining and hibachi seating the restaurant also has a full bar and sushi bar. Check out Shinto for family fun or a date night!"}
{"text":"One of the best Hibachi restaurants in town. A little on the pricey side, but the atmosphere is fantastic. It is your typical show at dinner, but the food is much fresher then other such restaurants. Worth a nice date night out."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Had a dinner reservation at 8:30. 40 minutes past and we were still not seated. We were told over and over again \"ok like can you please wait you're next.\" To our displeasure it was nothing but a lie. SAD"}
{"text":"Sunday I stopped in to Shinto's for some sushi since I was in the area, I use to go there a lot when I lived in Strongsville but now I'm an east sider. On Sunday they have specials on a few of their Specialty Rolls.  I always get the Little Delicious roll (which is award winning) which has cream cheese, avacado, crab meat and spicy tuna, deep fried with spicy mayo and eel sauce drizzled on top. It was on special for $10.50   the flavor just explodes in your mouth....it's very good..get it if you go there....but I guess it's not really sushi since it's deep fried? lol   I also got the Miso Surprise for $12 which is Shrimp tempura, cucumber, cream cheese, avocado and green onions with masago and crab drizzled with a sweet miso glaze (which was just ok) and then just a regular California roll for $5.50. total cost with tax and a side of the spicy mayo for dipping was $30.71 
The last time I was there they did not have the expanded sushi bar, they took out the fish pond and bridge and put in a bigger sushi bar with seating on three sides so maybe seating for 24 people"}
{"text":"I love Shinto! i was kind of surprised to see that it had only a 3 star rating, definitely not accurate in my opinion as I and everyone I know loves it.  I've been there many times, and I always get great service.  The chefs are always fun, energetic, and funny.  The food is delicious, and you really get a lot of food.  Each hibachi meal comes with soup, salad, a small mushroom or shrimp appetizer, fried or steamed rice, and your choice of meat/seafood.  Make sure to go try it out!"}
{"text":"When I got there the bartender gave me a glass and my bill, but no beer. I waited 10-15  minutes to get my beer. Which was stiffly overpriced. If you leave a respectible tip, you're paying 5x gas station prices for Sapporo. I shrugged that off, I was there for a friends birthday and to have fun.

The place over charged me for my sushi, I didn't realize until later that they charged me $1.50 more than what was in the menu for my food. Sure it's not much, but to add it to the fact it took so long for them to get us our sushi we were about to leave when they finally brought it to us. We received our sushi a half hour after the habachi people were done eating. That was the last time I will be going there. Used to be my favorite place, but after 2 times and it the service being completely disappointing, I will never ever ever go back."}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi.  Hibachi chefs are excellent and entertaining.  Nice ambiance and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Consistent quality. Sushi is good, sometimes spectacular...depending on the freshness of the ingredients. Hibachi  aka  teppan-yaki is fun to watch. You get seated with a bunch of other people at the same table and a chef comes along and cooks your meal on this giant hot plate in front of you. They keep you entertained by making onion volcanoes and trying to throw shrimp into your mouth. I've noticed that most people like to douse their dish with this special mayo sauce once the hibachi chef dishes out their meal. I recommend trying the food fresh off the grill first. Get some good clean flavour.
As for their bento's...I've tried it only once...on a Sat and it was alright..mostly come here for the sushi and if we're feeling social we do the Hibachi."}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had in Cleveland. The restaurant is so nicely decorated. I ordered take out for Valentine's Day!! It was delicious. Got a variety of rolls and the seaweed salad. I want to return soon to actually dine in."}
{"text":"If you are looking to have a nice date, go to dinner with some friends, or just carry out sushi, Shinto is the place for you. The food is not always worth the hefty price tag (last experience involved subpar chicken) but most of the time you come away very full and satisfied. The real advantage of Shinto is the experience. Hibachi (food is cooked in front of you) and charismatic chefs make for a nice time. The service was quite slow the last time few times I went, but this may be abnormal. Overall, I like Shinto and would recommend it to anybody looking for a cool dining experience."}
{"text":"After coming here on Saturday I had to write a review because me and my friends had a blast! First off the place was packed  so while we waited for our table we got a drink at the bar  (bartender was very cute lol). Once we sat at our hibachi table we got some sushi rolls because their sushi is amazing! Definitely One of the best spots in Cleve for sushi. Our server was great and chef made us delicious food and kept us entertained! Great place overall"}
{"text":"Having dinner with a group? Shinto is a good place to grab some food and entertainment but be prepared to pay. They recently expanded the bar area and have an extensive drink menu. 

Shintos food is good, but not amazing. If it wasn't for the homemade shrimp sauce (yum yum sauce) I am not sure if I would think it was any better than something I could make. Hibachi can get pretty expensive, the portions are smaller than I remember and the only thing I had left over was a mound of rice. Chicken and steak hibachi will run you $26, you get soup, side salad, a side of mushrooms, small side of fried veggies, and not a large amount of meat. The chefs are talented (mike jones is the best) and always guarantee some laughs. 

Sign up for there rewards program and get points towards gift certificates and appetizers. 

The bill for 5 of us (5 hibachi, 2 apps, 2 cocktails, and 2 rolls) was a little over $200 (not including tip)."}
{"text":"This is my fave place to go for sushi, by far best I've ever had with the exception of L.A. creative rolls, talented chefs, excellent management. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The service was very poor. The waitress was unkind, and unhelpful. The quality of the food was below average! I couldn't eat the edamame! I will never sponsor this rest"}
{"text":"Really sweet friendly staff and super accommodating! First time visit and will not be the last! Oliver was great!"}
{"text":"Like Stilton, I was apprehensive about going here as I read the reviews on my way there [hoorah, mobile yelp!]. However, one of my compadres was highly recommended to this place by a co-worker and the others with me wanted sushi, so thus we went.

I was pleasantly surprised with my experience. Yes, I agree with Bryn, this environment is a bit cheesy with the very boisterous chefs [although mine was surprisingly subdued], but I expected it after going to a Hibachi in Fairlawn/Montrose a while back. 

Arriving after the dinner rush on Wednesday night, our service was actually fine. Arriving early of our reservation, we went to the bar. 
The bartender gave us good service and let my sister who loves her Bloody Marys extremely spicy, the bottle of Sriracha to use to put in her desired amount. 

Entrees are $17-30 although they include a small salad, soup, and a side of veggies or rice. 
Instead, I opted for a couple appetizers, which are 1/2 half off on Wednesdays. 
Both of them were well worth the 1/2 price. The Hamachi Kama (normally $9), the collarbone of a yellowtail, was excellent. Note: I don't know much about Japanese cusinine or sushi, but after spending 6 months in Senegal, I do know a bit about fish. This was a great piece of fish. Cooked just enough to be tender and flaky, moist, with skin and bone in tact, with a very light buttery flavor on it. Delicious. I also tried the Scallop Motyaki which I had no idea what it was until I tasted it, spicy. Throughout the night, our server gave fine service and refilled our drinks at a reasonable speed. 
I noticed the chef at the table next over to me was using the gong as his customers were doing sake-bombs. 
The choice of music was a bit odd: Juvenile [circa 1999], Prince, Sade, and some R&B. 

A surprisingly pleasant, satisfying experience. If you're ordering entrees, Shinto can leave you a lot lighter in the pocket. Hibachi grills aren't my favorite, especially on my small budget, but it was worth it for the 1/2 off appetizers."}
{"text":"Good food....sushi is hit or miss, but usually decent. Habachi cooks are fun but service at the tables is slow but it's even worse at the bar.

Bartenders hardly acknowledge you and seem irritated when you flag them down. Doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"This used to be a really great place to eat and bring your family however recently it has become a frat party. Every time I walk in there it has crazy lights and loud music and a bunch of frat looking guys doing shots and screaming. I thought this was a Japanese restaurant? Also my friend got yelled at by the manager for asking to sit in a quieter area?! There are other Hibachi restaurants that are more authentic and no meat heads."}
{"text":"Very tasty and a great entertaining diner.  The typical bar tho it is not. Great drinks and specialties."}
{"text":"We've been  here a few times and had sushi only.  The price is $10-$15 for the rolls. The place has food that never tastes 100% fresh.  The seaweed around the fish is always chewy. Be prepared to wait forever for anything: table, food, check, even if you're the only people there.  One time we waited 30 min before we were even offer water.  Not very clean, the floors are sticky. Never going back."}
{"text":"One of the few places that get five stars in my book, from the chef service (MIKE JOOOOOOONES) to the quality of the food, its a staple in our dining out experience.

The chateau is worth spending a few bucks extra, ask Mike for an extra egg or two in the fried rice as well.  Sushi is fresh and tasty, there are interesting options for rolls.

Always a great time there, Shen makes you feel like family when you are there."}
{"text":"Shintos has some great food. A few things to consider. It's very difficult on a week night to walk in and get hibachi without waiting an hour. The wait staff is usually pretty young so it's hard to consider them credible when giving times and information. Other then that when you're in your seat it's full steam ahead."}
{"text":"The food at Shinto is beside the point. This is a sit-and-model kind of place. Strictly for the suburban BMW set. I'd rather go to Benihana and eat with real people."}
{"text":"This place has really declined over the years.  About 5 or more years ago the sushi was great, but it's gone downhill.  I do not recommend going here.  I was at Shinto a couple weeks ago and the sushi rice was bland, unseasoned, and on the mushy side.  Also,  I ordered a scallop appetizer that the menu described as four U-10 sized scallops.  The scallops I received were probably U-30s, very small and definitely not worth the $7.00 I had to pay."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at the Hibachi portion of the restaurant, so this review is not about that. It seems standard hibachi fare w/ cooks who are the show making volcano onion towers and such. I can only speak about the sushi and service. 

The sushi is definitely larger portions that I am used to as my wife and I ordered 4 rolls and could not even come close to finishing. The crab meat, which is typically one of my favorites, was very dry and chewy. The outer casing (not sure what this is called in sushi) that goes around the rice was very hard to chew and the rolls were very warm. I like my rolls room temp or colder and when the sauce that is drizzled on top starts to gel, that is not a good sign. Took too long to deliver our drinks and the pomegranate margarita was very weak and sweet. 

If you have another 10 minutes to drive to Ohashi in North Olmsted, do that and forgo the Shinto experience. It was ok, but for the money, which was much more than other sushi joints ($17 crab roll?) it is not worth it."}
{"text":"If you live in or anywhere near Strongsvile, odds are you have been to Shinto before! This is a fun place to come with a group for a birthday, a girls night or any reason you need to go out for a nicer dinner. It is also a good place to grab a quick cheap lunch.

Dinner Habachi runs anywhere between $20-$30 that comes with soup, salad, your choice of meat, white rice ($3 more for fried rice) mushrooms or shrimp, and veggies. 

Lunch Hibachi runs anywhere from $8-$12 and that includes soup or salad, white or fried rice (no extra charge), choice of meat, and either veggies or shrimp. The lunch portions are perfect and you are only paying around1/2 the price you would at dinner!

Tuesdays are 1/2 price sushi and Wednesdays are 1/2 price appetizers

Don't overlook getting a side of the udon noodles! They are so good! 

This atmosphere is fun and inviting, the newer sushi bar that replaced the Koi fish pond was a great addition to the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has a nice interior.  Very trendy although not at all Japanese IMHO.  The staff was very professional and friendly.  We happened to go on a tuesday when they had some 1/2 price sushi.  Miso soup and salad ginger dressing were a la cart.  Everything was top notch.  the rice in particular was not mushy like at some places.  the sushi and larger specialty roll were excellent.  The sashimi (raw slices of fish) were fresh but clearly on the small size.  I have to say that unless the sushi and sashimi that we had are smaller when it's half price, this place is way too expensive.  We will have to go at regular prices and see.  I was disappointed that they don't have a Sushi & Sashimi combo that includes soup, salad, sushi and sashimi like almost every other Japanese restaurant does and at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I came to visit Cleveland a month ago and my aunt took me to this restaurant. I had a great time. Our chef was really kind and gave us big portions. Also he did an awesome entertaining show. The quality of food is pretty good. I had the dinner with the fried rice beef and shrimp. Pretty delicious. I like the secret sauce. I think it was awesome service and the price was not expensive. It was overall price according to how much is in Los Angeles, CA. Next time I'm in town I would go again."}
{"text":"Japanese food is very tasty and this place will prove its tastiness. I have been here a lot whether its to enjoy the hibachi table or the sushi! They added a new sushi bar which I really like eating at. I really like being able to watch the chefs making my sushi. Also, on Tuesday it is half off sushi so I usually come then, it is more than worth it!

For the hibachi, it is great to come here with a group of people because the table seats plenty. They have a cornered are that is sectioned off if you want a more private setting for your group. I always have come here for special occasions. Its great to celebrate a friend or families birthday at because you are able to see everyone and also being entertained by watching the chefs cook your food!"}
{"text":"First time eating here at lunch today. I had the scallops, which were perfectly cooked. The Fried Rice and vegetables are do good I'm still thinking about them, and the shrimp are outstanding.

Good ambiance, a little pricy, great food and service. I believe my lunch was $15 before beverage.

The chefs are quite entertaining and make the visit fun.

Not a quick in and out place which is why they don't do a big lunch business. 

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If it's actual sushi that you are looking for, Shinto's is right up there.  I'm giving it a 4 not a 5 because they no longer carry ikura or uni but what they do have is great.   Tuesday is half priced sushi so the place is packed.  If you are interested in trying out some excellent Japanese appetizers go on Wednesday, it's half priced appetizer night."}
{"text":"Went to this place a few months back and forgot to write a review because I was so upset. We made the 30 minute drive because we had a gift card. We got inside and noticed a small printed sign that said they couldn't accept gift cards. They blamed it on a storm. I understand things happen, but it was very inconvenient. Our food was fine. We ordered chicken and shrimp hibachi and it was pretty average. However, we sat on the patio and it was very smokey.

Update 2/25:

Went here again and enjoyed the food by using my gift cards. I had the California cream cheese and volcano rolls with my husband and both were delicious. The California was pretty standard. The volcano was delicious and different from most rolls I have had.

Their salad was typical with a ginger dressing and good.

I had the noodles with shrimp which were good. The yum yum sauce was a good addition to dip in.

My husband had the chicken hibachi and enjoyed that too."}
{"text":"We no longer go there. It is a filthy hole. There's so many fruit flies in there that you know it has to be dirty. I've been sick twice off the food there and will never go back. The lights are too bright at the bar and the music is way too loud."}
{"text":"There are 10 Asian food options in Strongsville these days. Not all are created equal. The range is from take-out to full formal dining. Shintos is the latter.  And the best of the bunch.  The interior is artfully designed, spacious, and attractive.  But when it comes down to it, it is all about the food. Here is where they shine. I am a sushi lover extraordinaire and here is where I go to fulfill my hearts' desire....Asian style.  The offering is full spectrum (hint: know your sushi styles). You can enjoy experimenting because what you will get is the optimal offering of any style you like. Feel free to try sushi that you haven't before..they make it as good as it can get and you will experience the absolute way it is to be made. How else will you expand your Japanese palate unless you get it delivered to you the right way?   
  It gets busy here on weekend evenings and the atmosphere is a lot of fun. If you want habachi seating, it is available as well. Lot's of fun for groups and families. 
  Put this one on your list of fav's cause you'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"My experience was ruined before I even entered this establishment. The woman who answered the phone was so rude and the hostess was even worse (they might have even been the same person)- I actually considered leaving before being seated. I would maybe give this place a 3 star if it wasn't for that person/people because their sushi was pretty good. But their prices are outrageous, especially for hibachi. I will be returning to Samurai in Strongsville when I want a hibachi fix- I highly recommend it over this place. They don't over charge everything like Shinto and they are always pleasant there."}
{"text":"We headed out to Shinto in Strongsville last Sunday night which was exciting because it is my old stomping grounds (I grew up down the street). I've been to every hibachi spot in Strongsville and I will admit that Shinto does by far have the nicest look. It looks like a good time right when you walk in. 

My lady and I were with 3 other couples that night and did have a reservation. It also happened to be a polar vortex that night but that did not stop the Valentine's couples as the place was packed. We were seated at the closest table to the door. With it being extremely cold out it did make it EXTREMELY chilly in the restaurant. My girlfriend wore her coat the entire time we were in there. It was a bit disappointing that they didn't make an effort to try and keep the place any warmer than it was. 

To the food..which was great. Our server Megan, was friendly, knew the specials and was quick and efficient at getting our food and drinks to us. 

Appetizers:

1. We ordered the Lil' Delicious Roll (a personal favorite) which consists of 10 pieces of crab, spicy tuna, cream cheese, avocado goodness (did i mention it was deep fried!). 
2. The appetizer soup was great. It was almost an onion broth, mushroom soup that hit all the right spots. Maybe it was because of the cold but I really enjoyed the soup.
3. The mini salad was probably the worst part. Iceberg lettuce with a \"house dressing\" was noting to write home about.

Dinner:

We both ordered the Filet and Shrimp combination dinner. Our hibachi chef went by \"Bad Grandpa\" which I thought was hilarious and he was a delight. He really tried to get everyone involved with the standard onion volcano, saki shots, and flipping shrimps in everyone's mouths. 

The fried rice was cooked pleasantly as were the vegetables. I believe that the shrimp could have been cooked a little bit longer and could have used more soy sauce. The filet he prepared was PERFECT, I literally couldn't have asked him to cook it better. Let's just say we did not have any leftovers. 

I've been to Shinto many times and this time the food was better than it usually is. I'll admit it is a bit pricier than the other spots around town but the food and atmosphere are worth that extra few bucks. If they were more concerned about the temperature of the restaurant they might have received a five star review."}
{"text":"Agree.  Best hibachi in town.  Also most expensive but you pay for what you get.  Atmosphere is nice- employees are friendly.  Sushi is best on this side of town. No just wish they would do something different as far as the hibachi cooks perform- it's always the same routine and gets boring hearing the same thing over and over."}
{"text":"Nice place to hangout and eat well, especially in Strongsville.  Great sushi; the good stuff can get pricey though.  

I frequent there for their specials.  Sunday and Monday are specials on a few 'Special Rolls', I recommend the Little Delicious (cream cheese, avacado, spicy tuna, deep fried topped with sweet and spicy sauce).  This is normally $14.50 but on these days on special for $10.   Monday is also Martini Night with $5 Martinis (reg. $9-10).  Mostly cool bartenders with now more seating due to a new sushi bar.

Just took my sister and niece there for her birthday and sat in the private seating area (not hibachi/not bar) on a Tuesday for 1/2 price sushi rolls.  Really great service and a friendly atmosphere.  We ordered some seaweed salad and edamame for apps along with some fun mojitos (strong/delicious).  We ordered three 1/2 priced rolls along with a luscious shrimp tempura full priced roll.  Everything was great, even my 2 year old niece enjoyed it all.

I had our server bring over a complimentary birthday dessert for my sister while everyone sang happy birthday.  Overall a great time.  Our bill was $68 with 20% gratuity added for reference.  Obviously they make their money on other things while selling you $3 sushi rolls.  
Totally satisfied though."}
{"text":"I truly love Shinto more for their great sushi then the habachi.  On Tuesday's they have half price sushi and I have never had any complaints with that.  Sushi is always really fresh and when it arrives it is art, almost to good to eat.  My favorite sushi roll is the little delicious and that is deep fried and out of this world but is more expensive.  If you are going to do hibachi I recommend going for lunch instead of dinner because it is literally half the price.  The catch? You get to pick either soup or salad instead of getting both.  Even with one of them being removed it is still way more than enough to eat."}
{"text":"I'm no veteran of Japanese hibachi, but I was highly amused by this ridiculous spectacle at Shinto. (Not entertained, mind you, just amused.) I appreciated the fact that a large amount of effort was being put forth to entertain me all night, with huge balls of flame and drunken idiots banging on gongs and people acting like trained sea lions, and yet I was having absolutely none of it, and this was, I suppose, kind of entertaining in itself. 

Shinto is ideally suited for people who like to attend mystery dinner theater shows, who eat at buffets on cruise ships, who join conga lines without hestitation, and who think Jim Belushi is the funniest guy on television. I am not one of these people. These things tend to make me nauseous and contemplate suicide. So, it's hard for me to write a fair and balanced review. But that's never stopped me before, so here it goes.....

This place is set up like a huge strip club, with patrons huddled around one of perhaps a half-dozen \"stages\" (but instead of nude women on stage, you have these Japanese dudes in silly hats). There is an abundance of distractions... balls of flame...people smashing toy gongs...birthday cakes with fireworks shooting out them...pink elephants. It's like a poor man's Cirque du Soleil. Once every twenty minutes, a chant erupts somewhere from a distant group of dinners. I can't decipher what it is they're shouting, but it's clearly intended to prove that are having a much better time than anyone else. Is there a teleprompter with these chants? Is there a guidebook with printed lyrics? What triggers these events? And who gets the privilege of banging the gong? Do these strange Japanese rituals have any more cultural authenticity than John Wayne's teeth? And where do they get these hibachi chefs from, anyhow? Is there a secret camp at the base of Mount Fuji where they train in secrecy, their mission to colonize the American suburbs? 

I really need to get drunk, to get over my conceit and enjoy this madness, but the drink service is so slow that I can't even sustain a buzz. (The whole service is bad... it's not even worth going into the details.) I resort to drinking my wife's saketini, which she abandoned after two sips realizing that it tasted like a combination of Aqua-Net hairspray and liquid propane, but this doesn't help either. What I really need are some DRUGS, some hallucinogens and psychotropic drugs powerful enough to allow me to believe that balancing an egg on a spatula is mystical and amazing and entertaining.

Oh yes, we're here to eat....almost forgot. We order a round of sushi rolls. They're not bad, actually. The miso soup comes and it's terrific. Steamy hot with lots of nice herbs. Here comes our hibachi chef. He's clearly a novice (which I am actually enjoying because it adds to the overall absurdity of it all.) He can't seem to light the \"onion volcano\" because his butane lighter won't work, so he says fuck it and gives up, not wishing to incinerate himself for the benefit our amusement. We are denied our ball of flame. 

Next up comes the obligatory stupid human trick of tossing of food at our mouths. (Only one of my friends is game for this activity.) The chef can't get the pieces of broccoli anywhere near his mouth. The broccoli hits him on the forehead, on the glasses, into his lap. They try it over and over again without success. It's as uncomfortable and pathetic as watching Manny Ramirez attempt to play left field. Finally, the chef either gives up or runs out of broccoli, I'm not sure exactly which, to the relief of our entire table. 

Actual cooking is taking place on the hibachi now. My wife watches in horror as the tuna goes from rare to medium-rare to medium to well-done. We're trying to tell the chef to remove the damn tuna already, but his command of the idiom is apparently weak and it's too late. The tuna is ruined. My swordfish is even worse: overcooked, greasy, fishy. He treats it with such lack of dignity, it would make Linda Greenlaw walk the plank. I would have preferred he grab a goldfish from the koi pond and cooked that up for me, since it wouldn't have tasted any different. But at this point, I'm already completely full and beyond caring about anything except getting the hell out of here.

However, an expedient departure is not in the cards. We have to linger for another 30 minutes or more. We receive drinks that we forgot we ordered. A drunk from the table behind us fall over in his chair into my wife. No one cares. The saketini receives instant karma and goes smashing to the floor. Busboys wearing Madonna-like headsets eventually sweep in to clear plates and remove the broken glass. We finally get our bills and leave.

The show is mercifully over. The curtain falls. My thoughts trail off into absurdity...."}
{"text":"Shintos is the best!!! I love the food here and the staff is great! Sushi is awesome! 

CK is the best chef! Ask for him!"}
{"text":"Shinto, you never disappoint me.

Whether I'm in for sushi or hibachi, I always leave saying how delicious my food was. 

On our most recent visit, we had the Hot Lava roll for the first time and insisted that everyone try it because it was so good!  All of the rolls were awesome- Little Delicious, Philadelphia, and Spicy Tuna.

Some of my friends got hibachi and they were very happy with the food. I thought our chef was excellent, but some thought he could have provided a little more showmanship. BUT there were 10 of us at the table and only 3 got hibachi, so I can understand.

There are less expensive places around town to get sushi and hibachi, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a better experience. Shinto will always be my #1 recommendation for this cuisine in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Good menu variety.  Service is a little slow on half off sushi night.  To be expected though.  Overall one of the better sushi joints around town.   If you havent been here, check it out."}
{"text":"A recent date had me driving to Strongsville and using my GPS to find the way. I should have got off on the Royalton Rd exit instead of Pearl, that is beside the point. We came on a Tuesday, purely by coincidence and it was the half off day. All of the rolls were good. The service was alright. They definitely were slammed and it took about 20 minutes to get my beer. The little salads with ginger dressing were refreshing and light. I normally don't venture out to Strongsville but was glad that I did. It seems like everything that you need is within spitting distance of each other. The bill came out to around $50 and we left stuffed to the gills. If I lived a little bit closer, I would frequent Shinto for the many different specials they have throughout the week."}
{"text":"Went here the other night for dinner.  First off, Strongsville has really gone downhill, and the clientele shows this. This place is really just a gimmick, hibachi is not really anything special.

The food is very Americanized Japanese food.  They serve an iceberg lettuce salad, with some dressing that has soy and ginger.  They try to pass that off as Japanese.  The service is subpar, and it seems to be another poorly managed restaurant, that gets by with mediocre food.  

tl;dr Overpriced, mediocre food and service, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Horrible service on a Monday but the sushi saved the 30 min trip"}
{"text":"My friends and I had the absolute best experience at Shinto. I was skeptical at first, considering the bar was not busy but the bartenders were slow to serve us. But our server Megan and our hibachi chef Victor made up for all of that. I have never had this positive of a dining experience. They were amazing, entertaining, and true professionals. My friends and I will absolutely return. And we'll be requesting Megan and Victor for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness Yummmmm...I've never gone into Shinto and not come out stuffed and satisfied! The LITTLE DELICIOUS ROLL...FILET ROLL...and The BLACK WIDOW ROLL are all CRAZY GOOD! The hibachi food is great as well...I  always top off my fabulous sushi with a great Dirty Martini...also really well made and delicious. Go to SHINTO, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This place was uncomfortably hot, I mean HELLA hot! It was uncomfortable to drink in there. I got hot sake twice, the second one truly burned going down. Temperature burn, not alcohol. The machine was turned up to the max temp setting, I was pissed. 

Once seated, we sat a little longer than expected for our meal to be prepped. I have seen way better hibachi chefs in my day. The guy was funny though, his name tag said Mike Jones, after the rapper who fell off the face of the earth. Maybe that was him, he did lose a ton of weight, hmmmm? He kept saying the \"who?, Mike Jones\", to himself, but every time I said it he didn't respond. Pissed about that too. 

The food was so so, for what I walked out spending compared to how much I ate and the quality if my food, I was very unimpressed. 

They have a sushi class available too I found out, that table seemed to be having lots of fun, id like to try that someday.

{"text":"Love coming to Shintos!! Come atleat 1x a month for sushi and or hibachi! Little delicious roll is the best! Never a negative moment! Spent $965 to host my wedding rehearsal dinner here and with 30 people n 0 complaint from it nothing better to be happy about! Thanks for being awesome"}
{"text":"Can't really go wrong with Shinto. I love that it is a trendy, fun restaurant in a convenient location and you don't have to go to downtown Cleveland, find parking, etc. I have been here about 3 times in the past couple years and have never had a bad experience. The food is tasty and quality. I went this time with my parents while they were in town, and my husband. We came very late on a Saturday night (8:30 or so) and I did not make a reservation, which was my own fault. Ended up waiting about 45 minutes for a table at the Hibachi stations, and when we got our table we were the only ones seated at it (which was nice), so I guess the night was winding down by that point. the bar area was hopping though!! Our chef was very nice and funny, and it was his birthday that day. It was a relaxing atmosphere and the drinks were good (I had a Long Island). The only complaint I have is that the music was way too loud in there. I could barely carry on a conversation with my parents, who are in their 50s. Bring the noise level down a little and it will be okay Shinto! You will still be cool and trendy as people are able to hear each other speak! :)"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Took a friend for a special birthday dinner to enjoy his first hibachi and \"show.\"  From the beginning, I felt rushed. While the food was actually good enough, we might as well have been peeking through a kitchen window. The hibachi chef confirmed our orders, put the food on, cooked it and left. 
There were no knife tricks, no flaming onion volcano, no saki bombs, no food toss, no joking with the chef...actually, he didn't even talk to us. 
My friend's birthday was not acknowledged and as soon as our dinner plate was cleared, we received out check. Too bad, we had planned on dessert. 
Have been to this hibachi several times since I discovered it but I won't be back. It's gone downhill, the service is poor and, quite frankly, without the show, it's overpriced for the food. I'd rather the drive to Benihana on the east side or even Wasabi....service is always great, show is great and you get the noodles without the extra charge."}
{"text":"loved this place. only complaint is we had reservations and didnt get seated til 20 mintues later. and a chef didnt come for an hour"}
