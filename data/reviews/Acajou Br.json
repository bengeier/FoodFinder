{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Brazilian food, or if you've never tried Brazilian food before, you'll love this place. The menu has a great mix of options from different areas of Brazil - try the bolinho de bacalhao (they're like cod croquettes) and the coxhinha (fried mashed potato croquettes with chicken inside). The ceviche is also amazing! The staff are super friendly and warm. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Our group of seven went in for dinner on a Friday night. The atmosphere is nice and cozy and the staff were friendly. Having never had experience authentic Brazilian food, I was happy to try it out for the first time. I ordered a soup for appetizer and slow cooked meat stew for the main course. The caldo verde soup was good, and warms you up quickly from the cold winter. The stew was delicious. The pork and beef were very tender, and the flavors were very tasty. I only wished there was a little more rice or another starch, as there was so much sauce and it would have made the stew even better. Price was okay at around $30. My friends also enjoyed their meal. Overall, a great place to try out Brazilian food, and I would go back to try something different."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The owner is so kind and helpful when it came to our budget and food interests. He helped us order an amazing meal! Delicious pulled pork and beans,  coconut shrimp and cashew chicken on rice! The meal included soup and salad appetizer. He even told us how to eat the sliced orange before the beans as it aids digestion and is what Brazilians do :) I walked away feeling so full and healthy!"}
{"text":"Visited Montreal for a weeklong family vacation last month. We had a lot of great food at various price ranges, some higher some lower. Went to the famous smoked meat places, got bagels, poutine (several times), the orange drink, etc. and even had some great Chinese food. Loved most of it.... but out of all the places we ate, Acajou Br is the one meal still on my mind! Their feijoada in particular is wonderful. They don't have many reviews but it should tell you something that all of them are very good. This is my first Yelp review.... I'm usually the guy who thinks \"if a restaurant got my money, and I didn't send anything back, that should be enough positive feedback for them\" but I truly hope more people learn about this place so they can thrive!"}
{"text":"Try the Xim Xim (I think pronounced \"sheem sheem\"). I had it! A-freaking-mazing. Best dish on the menu.  The first time I went here, my friends and I were wandering down St-Laurent looking for Indian food. We walked by and took a look a the menu posted outside. Being students, we were a little irked by the prices and were discussing this. A lady overheard us and started to say the food was really quite good. She then said she was the owner and makes all the food herself. She even used to have a catering business that served movie productions (hence the photos on the wall). So she promised us that if we didn't like the food, we would get our money back!   We got in there, and (I think) one of her sons was the waiter for the day. He was hilarious while we waited for the food (which was just a tad long but so, so worth the wait). We ordered appetizers and main dishes. Main dish proportions were large, easily could feed two people but it was so good I ate it all myself.  Last, we tried one of the drinks, I forget the name, but it was a specialty with limes and crushed ice and Brazilian liquor. The next time I was there, I ordered two of them. (And hey, at six bucks, they're not too bad!)  Basically, really friendly people and amazing food was had at Acajou. Go!"}
{"text":"Very nice little family-owned Brazilian restaurant in Mile End. Mushroom soup and caldo verde were excellent, and a side of beans turned out to be a surprising festival of delicious garlic goodness. Very friendly owner, I recommend taking his recommendations, if in doubt."}
{"text":"Apesar de todos os comentários positivos, minha experiência neste lugar não foi positiva. Pedi uma feijoada que não tinha tempero e nem gosto. O arroz estava duro e velho. A carne e a farofa nem se falam. O valor da comida é absurdamente caro para o que eles estão oferecendo."}
{"text":"I went to the Acajou bar with a pretty large group for a friend's birthday party. I absolutely loved the food and the ambiance. The owner/chef and waitresses were really nice and friendly. I had the Feijoada and the cheese bread which were awesomeeeee..."}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow, and the food seemed to be overpriced for what it was. The food itself was neither amazing nor inedible."}
{"text":"Acajou Br was so good I created a yelp account to post this review. The food was great and there were many vegetarian options, which is a rarity for Brazilian. Service was top notch, and it's the best meal I've had in Montreal so far."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience..... meal of Brazilian tapas..... fresh, delicious, will be back! Thanks Brett and Ana....."}
{"text":"Excellent service. They do speak English and they take credit cards. The food was excellent and came out hot and very tasty. Owner came and chatted with us for a while as well, which was very nice.  Even took time to entertain my 7 year old daughter. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I tried Feijoada and Ximxim and both were delicious homemade dishes. The host is super friendly. Make sure to bring an appetite, these are filling comfort foods."}
{"text":"Really nice small restaurant with authentic Brazilian fare. The staff are very friendly and helpful and make you feel welcome. Decent wine selection, only one Portuguese bock beer. This restaurant is a real underrated gem."}
{"text":"Incredible. It's not often that one can have a totally bad experience from the very beginning to the very end of a restaurant outing - quite an achievement in itself. From the start - even after making a reservation, it took 20 mins to sit us down.  It was one hour from sitting down to then get our starters. We had the fried fish pieces and calamari. Both of the dishes were soggy, wet, and not very fresh tasting. The batter separated immediately off the fish. Not good, and one of the rare times that I don't finish the dish - even being very hungry at this stage.  For the main, I tried the \"Chicken Xim Xim\" - some sort of stew. Many things wrong with this: The dish itself was bland, flavourless, and any other adjective you care to use to describe 'tasteless'. The chicken didn't seem right at all - both in freshness and texture. Seriously, I've had better microwaved curries. This was served up with some plain boiled rice that had the texture of the dry stuff left over the day before. The side salad tasted like a standard bagged faire, with a balsamic dressing straight from the store-bought bottle.   The service was lackadaisical and uninterested at best. Washroom needs attention in the cleanliness department. The knockout blow was the $80 price tag for two mains, the starter, and three drinks. The 4.5 stars this place has makes me seriously doubt the integrity of the '5 star' reviews for this restaurant - I would say they are either fake, or they were drunk when they were either eating at this place or writing their Yelp review.  I also doubt whether half the celebrities on their photo wall actually went there - Robert de Niro? I don't think so. Three hours, $80, and a Saturday night I will never get back."}
{"text":"Best Brazilian Restaurant in Montreal! You can feel like home in there! I tried bolinho de bacalhau and caldo verde, just amazing!"}
{"text":"Stellar place! The host was delightfully funny and such a character. Great recommendations and delicious food. Fejioada and steak were complex and will paired but the bobo shrimp was a bit lackluster. Recommended!"}
{"text":"We ate every last bit.  I recommend the Xim Xim. The Calamar grille was OK. The mango salad was tasty."}
{"text":"Great Brazilian food, awesome experience. The owner is a funny man who made our dinner even better with his great sense of humor. The food was delicious, very home made, I had feijoada and my husband had xin-xin. Both were awesome."}
{"text":"I was torn between giving this 3 or 4 stars. I decided to be nice :) The food here is really good! It tastes authentic and you don't leave feeling overstuffed, greased out or nasty. I found the Caipirinha to be okay - nothing really to scream about, but the other reviewers like it, so I would give it a try. Per the other yelp suggestions, we tried the Feijoada and Ximxim. Both were very very delicious.  The thing about this place is the wait. We waited for more than an hour before we got our food and there was only one other party in the restaurant. It may be because the mother is the only one cooking. Yes, I appreciate that home-cooked style feeling, but not at the expense of me waiting more than one hour for any action. Another cook would be better. So, totally up to you. If you don't mind waiting a really long time, need some time to catch up with your long lost friend or lover - go here. But if you want something delicious and quick, keep walking."}
{"text":"The meals were delicious and the host was really sociable and friendly! Cozy vibes. Would totally come back soon for the Brazilian chicken nuggets."}
{"text":"They are now open for lunch Fri-Sun. We started with the chicken nuggets And had the Feijoada as a main.  Service was excellent, the owner is a very witty and friendly man. The nuggets where good but I was no a fan of the doughy texture.   He suggested the traditional slow cooked Feijoada dish with black beans, braised pork sausage, rib and beef (brisket I believe). It was very tasty! The meat was incredibly tender and had a nice slightly smoky flavour - reminded me of wood oven roasted meats from a Brazilian steak house.  It was a very good hearty meal for a very reasonable price. I recommend."}
{"text":"I'm Brazilian so every time I travel to a new city I look for Brazilian restaurants to try. I chose Acaju BR based on Yelp reviews and they were not wrong. The food was absolutely fantastic, the staff were super super nice and the atmosphere of the restaurant was simply great and had an awesome family vibe to it!   I tried the chicken ximxim which is something I had never had before and loved everything about it! My boyfriend had the feijoada and said it was the best he's had. We also had coxinhas and pastel as appetizers and they were both delicious as well.  The main dishes are around $18 each but they're a very good portion.   I must say, this was my favorite Brazilian restaurant we've been to so far!"}
{"text":"As a Brazilian I have to say: The cod fish croquettes it was hard to stop on the first order. The Feijoada is a must to eat here, it's one of the best feijoada that I ever had overall! The owners Bred, rio carioca, funny and layback and his mother Dona Ana \" the chef with a magic hands\"! I almost forgot, everything with the real caipirinha!!!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience ever. We booked the place but had to wait for 30 minutes because employees made a mistake. After that we waited for menu for another 15 minutes. Appetizers arrived 1,5 hour later: calamari were extremely small, fish wasn't fried enough and had an \"old\" smell and oil taste. Main dishes came with a salad bought in Metro, rice was \"crispy\" (Probably scratched from the bottom) and food was blunt. Dirty glasses were left on the table the whole evening. At the end they asked us why we hadn't include tips! This restaurant doesn't deserve even half of its prices!!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for an authentic Brazilian restaurant in Montreal, and came here because of the overwhelmingly good reviews. We ate here twice. The ambiance is not that great, and the first time we were close to the door, that did not close well and were literally FROZEN. The first time however, the food was much better than the second.   The cocktails are delicious, and the staff is very welcoming. There are a LOT of vegetarian options, and so we had the manioc fries, the cheese buns, the cheese pastels, the mango salad and the Xodo (vegetarian main dish). They were so tasty and absolutely delicious! The second time however, the portions were smaller, we did not get cashews crumbled onto the fries which had made it very tasty the first time, and the Xodo did not come with the coconut milk and cashew sauce- only the cashew sauce... and so was blander. The mango salad, the second time around, took so much time to come out, that we just cancelled the order, as we were done all our other dishes. We will give it one more chance, because the food was so good the first time!"}
{"text":"Truly excellent Brazilian food. The owners are a witty Brazilian man and his mother. She handles all the cooking with precision. Nothing here is rushed, or can be, for that matter.   The decor is quaint, the service laid back --almost to a fault -- but the caipirinhas are truly outstanding and the food reminded our Brazilian friend of his childhood. As for us, non-Brazilians, we were thoroughly enchanted by the whole experience.   Strongly recommended. And the prices are very reasonable, by the way."}
{"text":"Tip: if you plan on going to go on a Sunday, double or triple check. The most puzzling thing is that we clearly made a reservation for a Sunday evening with someone on the other end of the line. We showed up at the appointed time to find the restaurant closed!  I'll be glad to update this review once I've actually had a chance to taste the food, but an error like this really takes the cake."}
{"text":"Plats typiques, ambiance typique, chaleur typique aussi ;) hihi Non sans farce, la bouffe est vraiment délicieuse, les spécialités sont riches en saveur et copieuses. Seuls hics: pas de clim (nous y étions un vendredi midi et il faisait vraiment chaud) et aussi c'est quand même long le temps de préparer les plats, nous étions un groupe et avons attendu assez longtemps... Sinon, la serveuse et le propriétaire sont adorables, la bouffe est bonne, l'endroit est joliment décoré, bref, fo le tester!"}
{"text":"Great and authentic Brazilian food. Pastel, coxinha and the feijoada were absolutely perfect!"}
{"text":"Very good food!!!friendly staff.IRecomend for anyone. If you want to taste the true Brazilian food Acajou is the place that you must go."}
{"text":"First time eating Brazilian (other than steak houses) and could not have been happier with the results. Everything we ate was fantastic, and we will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Excellent food and authentic. Service was excellent and attentive. It's a great little gem if you are looking for real home style Brazilian food rather than the all you can eat grills."}
{"text":"Outstanding little restaurant.  After reading so-so reviews for another Brazilian place we were going to try, we went here instead based on previous Yelp reviews.  We were not disappointed.  For appetizers we had the calamari which was perfectly done in a spicy lime marinade, and the Brazilian cheese breads - I forget what they're called (bolinho de queijo?) which were melt in your mouth delicious (our almost 11yr old son loved these).   For the main course I had the XimXim, my wife had the Feijoada (traditional Brazilian stew w/ pork & beans) and our son had the Picanha steak.  We had never had Brazilian before and were all delighted with our choices.  The XimXim contained the most tender chicken I've ever had, and the sauce was delicious.  The Feijoada was wonderfully savory, and our son declared the steak phenomenal (he shared a few bites and I have to agree with his assessment).  The owner/chef Brett is a super nice guy who went out of his way to make sure we understood what everything was and the best way to enjoy it.  Can't recommend this place highly enough, and we'll certainly be back on our next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Delicious and very authentic Brazilian food at a reasonable price! I ate the feijoada (promotional price on Sunday's) and it was perfectly cooked. The pastel and bolinho de bacalhau are great appetizers."}
{"text":"Kim nous avait proposé de nous réunir dans ce restaurant pour découvrir la cuisine brésilienne. Super organisation, nous voilà prêt pour le repas !  La cadre est sympa, des tableaux colorées ornent les murs et donnent une atmosphère convivial au restaurant. Le patron vous explique allègrement les plats et la prononciation de ceux ci ce qui renforce l'immersion dans l'ambiance brésilienne :)  Au niveau de la cuisine les plats sont bons, on sent une cuisine familiale qui donne des plats avec des saveurs. Tout le monde a été satisfait de ces plats.  Gros plus aussi pour les cocktails et jus qui sont réalisés avec des fruits frais. Ils sont vraiment très bon et c'est typiquement le genre de cocktail/jus que l'on ne trouve pas ailleurs. A tenter absolument, même si vous souhaitez juste prendre un verre sans manger :)  En conclusion je dirais que ce restaurant mérite votre attention si vous souhaitez découvrir des plats typique brésiliens. La qualité des plats et cocktails est au RDV. Seul petit bémol au premier abord je trouve que les plats sont un peu cher, pas moins de 19$, mais cela s'explique par les ingrédients qui sont de qualité et parfois non commun au Canada. Au final après avoir mangé on se sent moins lésé car l'expérience en valait la peine :)"}
{"text":"We arrived near closing time, they welcomed us in regardless and were extremely friendly.  Service was exceptional and the food was amazing.  Will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"If you eat steak, go eat here! If you're vegetarian and you eat fish, go for it! If you're all the way veg, well, it wouldn't be top of my list based on what I had last night.  My family and I ended up here after walking on St Laurent and overall it was a great choice. Cosy, welcoming, not too loud, super friendly service, and my family all loved what they ordered - chicken, shrimp, and sizzling steak plates. Value for money was very good, everyone cleared their plates and were perfectly full. They didn't have their usual vegetarian plate available so what I got seemed like a bowl of sauce for another dish with the protein taken out. Ouf. I'd still go back because the mango salad was lovely and I'd be into trying what they usually do for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Nouvelle découverte recommandé par un collègue brésilien (gage de qualité!). Cuisine délicieuse et sans prétention. Bon rapport qualité/prix/ quantité. Bonne ambiance et excellent service, serviable et sympathique. J'ai trouvé que la carte n'offre pas énormément de choix mais ça rend la cuisine plus authentique.  Préférer le mercredi car danse et cours de dance brésilienne en bonus."}
{"text":"Great food!  I'm Brazilian and this is the most authentic food I have eaten in Montreal. Delicious! The service was a bit slow, but it was obvious that the food was made all from scratch in the kitchen.  Overall the service was great, the food was well priced with good portions, the drinks were really nice!( great caipirinha!)   Also the vegetarian menu was delicious! With soups and salads to go with it."}
{"text":"Both food and drink are amazing! Must-go if in town, friendly owner/chef, great ambience. The caprinha is one of the best I've had, can't go wrong with anything on the food menu either! We had a mix of seafood and meat, many recommended from owner himself, of course great choices!"}
{"text":"Oh this place, about a year ago I happened to be strolling down Laurier trying entertain to some family , it was a warm balmy night , the air was still and our belly's were empty.we were looking for something to satisfy our hunger and provide a  comfortable resting place for us as a young family to catch up, talk about our new endeavors , and revel in the summer air we so cherish that is left ; in late august Montreal.As we entered the doors we were warmly welcomed by the presumed owner of the establishment. upon being seated and  ordering our various drinks, some of them being alcoholic , we felt comfortable and warm in comparison to the cooling night air we had so  been accustomed to seconds prior.  lets just say the rest of the night was not so pleasant , my sisters peanut butter soup seemed really delicious, but also my brothers chopped up pineapple with sliced  ham seemed really good. once i finally got my steak it was cooked AMAZINGLY, the meat itself was blacker then the darkest corner of my cockroach infested apartment on the shortest day of the year. after our meal, whole faimily was accused of underage drinking. needless to say we spent alot of money . Acuju Br is one of my favourite restaurants in the Montreal , AND FOR GOOD REASON .Peace, love and recognition for  panama canal cuisine. if not for the  experience, come for the feeling and ethnic experience. sincerely ,  OMFG loling so hard, this place SUCKS . Never go!!!!!!!!!!!           Stuart William Mitchell III"}
{"text":"We discovered this place wanting to find a place to have supper with colleagues. It's a relatively small restaurant, perfect for going in small groups or with a significant other...  Decoration is very nice and has a very sentimental meaning because it has many images that represent Brasil (Bathrooms are for Pélés and Carmen Mirandas) and also many pictures of the owner's family and great moments that happened in this restaurant  during its history.  Speaking of which, the owner, a very nice gentleman, who also prepared the dishes, told us that on Wednesdays, there is a musical group and brazilian dance with an instructor!!  The drinks are delicious, I had Caipirinha and Coco Loco that has Cachaça, Brasil's own sugar cane liquor. They were just perfect and not very strong on the liquor.  The food ordered was delicious (I had bisteca), many of my colleagues ordered Bobo, and also found it good. The portions are quite big, I loved the Feijoadas!   It took quite long though to prepare the food for our group (not a complain, because I do understand that the owner was the only one cooking, and one could tell the ingredients were fresh and took time to cook well), however, we didn't have too many other options of having something to nibble on while waiting for the food,...  No desserts either, and the coffee machine unfortunately wasn't working...  I found the prices a bit too expensive (from 18.95-25-95) just for the plate, and ideally this could be improved a bit more by offering a Table d'hôte with entrée, dessert and coffee for that price, than just charging for the plate...  I hope they have a great success because they are good, the 5th star is not awarded just for the small aspects to improve..."}
{"text":"So good! This is some legit Brazilian food. It's the real deal. Portion sizes are generous. The food is made by the owner/chef so it's consistently delicious.  The service is amazing and with a relaxing ambience. Have a cocktail as well, Brazilian style of course."}
{"text":"This place is mind-blowing. Awesome home-cooked style Brazilian food at an affordable price. Perfectly grilled meats, great vegetarian options, and savory smoothies (try the mango!) Don't get discouraged by the long cooking times - the owner/chef is making everything a la minute in the back. This place is simply glorious. To add even more to the proverbial pie, the owner gave us bowls of what I can only describe as the best lentil soup I've ever had, on the house, because of the wait. This is a gem that should not be ignored!"}
{"text":"Long story short: if you haven't figured out what to eat tonight, go to Acajou. You won't be sorry.   I've been walking past this place for the past 3 years, almost stopped, yet just kept walking every time. I think it's because, before this, my only experience with Brazilian food was churrascaria. Don't get me wrong, churrascaria is amazing, but there's only so often you can do all you can eat meat.   Fast forward to today. We were trying to figure out where to go and I wanted to try something different and it fell between Acajou and Restaurant Om (Tibetan food - also incredible). Needless to say, we made the right choice.   We weren't super hungry, so we only ordered the chicken xin xim and the feijoada. There wasn't a single scrap of food left on the plate. Brett (the owner, super nice guy) also brought us a piece of steak and it was easily one of the best things I've eaten this year. Crispy edges, tender middle and a perfect medium rare, I could eat this on a daily basis and never get tired of it."}
{"text":"Excellent Brazilian food. Have Brazilians friends in Salvador de Bahia, and the Acajou Br offers really good non Canadian localized Brazilian food! It's true, the service was a little long though we were 12 for a lunch... The rice was too dry for my feiojada : certainly they kept it warm in the oven as we were 12.  À little overpriced for a lunch but the quantity and quality worth it.  The chef told us they're bringing a new menu for lunch.   Excellent service as well, very warm and the chef came to speak with us personally!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for dinner at Acajou BR.  We liked it very much and on our next visit to Montreal, we would be ready to go again and sample other dishes.  First, the restaurant atmosphere is pleasant and the staff was very friendly, attentive and able to explain the food in detail.  It is a family-run business and it is clear that they cook food to be authentic, the way that you would expect from your own family.  There was a mushroom soup that was very flavourful (a good way to warm up if you are coming in during the Montreal winter). The two main courses that we had were quite large and filling: the feiojada is a typical Brazilian dish with meats and black-beans simmered in a sauce/stew, served with rice, greens as well as cassava.  Extra spice is provided on the side, but the flavour of the stew is rich.  The chicken Xim-Xim dish uses cashews to make a creamy sauce.  Both meals are satisfying --- and then, there is the crème-caramel or flan for dessert.  I have never before had flan that was as thick and as delicious as this; and this will be repeated on our next visit!!"}
{"text":"good cozy family run business. you see the passion at there work. Great steak, calamari a la planche, ceviche. good but not wow. i guess i've been too spoiled with churrascaria too often and this is more a traditional home cooked style."}
