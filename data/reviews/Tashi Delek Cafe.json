{"text":"Found this joint while on hunt for good Tibetan Nepalese MoMos. 5 star for the quick service and value for money. Idle place for takeaways of MoMos and other Nepali Tibetan dishes."}
{"text":"A great value option for Tibetan & momos! I was able to feed my family of 3 for under $20, with leftovers from lunch today.  For me, that definitely hits the spot.

Food is solid; while there are better momos out there, you're paying for that; it depends on your mood & preference.  This place doesn't get enough pub.

They also gave me a complimentary butter tea (my first ever), and I loved it.  My wife... not so much.  

The people there are super nice.  I was the only non-Tibetan in the joint.

Will come back again!"}
{"text":"A small family run business tucked away in Parkdale that serves the best priced momos as well as other Tibetan dishes. I loved the veggie momos which was an awesome deal. It's filled with potato, green veggies and tofu. You must eat the momos immediately to really enjoy them at its best. I also like their special sauce on the side."}
