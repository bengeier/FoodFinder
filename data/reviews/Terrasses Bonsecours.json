{"text":"Terrible frozen cocktails. We got the blue raspberry and cucumber and basil frozen cocktails on a hot summer day. The ice was not slushed properly, still chunky and not mixed well with the other liquids used. The blue raspberry was pretty much vodka in ice with barely any other flavors. The cucumber and basil was extremely bland and practically no basil taste. Not recommended."}
{"text":"This is a gorgeous spot to grab a drink (I did not eat). The vibe was very-very European/new money/some would say douchey. Perfect spot for a Sunday-Funday. A little pricey, but you are paying for the atmosphere and views."}
{"text":"Oh Sir where do I begin. This place was recommended for Sunday brunch and tappas. Oh my excitement at the possible selection.  Let me begin by saying the location is beautiful. The DJ was awesome and the actual food was absolutely hands down delicious. I mean 5 out 5. The chef is clearly talented. That's where it ends.   The food selection is limited, disturbingly overpriced, serving sizes are comical even for tappa style. Not to mention it's far too expensive to have a true tappa style experience. We had to ask for bread to help fill us up.   The wait staff, bouncers and hosts are snotty. Professional is great but only catering to high rollers is weird. Oh I can't forget to mention the pretend high rollers in this place. Everywhere you look there's a table with bottle service...one bottle!! Lol bottle service for the poor, I guess. The guests are snotty as well. Which I must commend them for because we were dripping sweat down our faces from the lack of shading umbrellas and looked roasted while the high rollers kept their composure the whole time. They must have been wearing sweat proof makeup!!   All in all, this place is an experience. Go once, waste your money and never go back. Unless of course you're into over spending, being cooked by the sun and going home hungry and craving cereal.   Not I   All in all, this place is all human thumbs down"}
{"text":"J'ai lu que il y a bcp de commentaire parlent de leur mauvaise service, j'ai cru pas, mais la vérité preuve que les commentaires sont justes. C horrible comme service. Ce pub fait énormément de l'effort sur l'apparence de serveuse mais oublie la qualité de service. C dommage!"}
{"text":"Very very disappointed in this place. View is nice, music is great, and food was very good. But the service and drinks were so horrendous that it's hard to put words to it. We sat and the hostess gave us 1 menu for 3 people. Lol. We asked to be in the shade, so she put us next to a bush that was completely infested in bees. Also, rather than putting us in the shade, she put an umbrella up above the table beside us - nice gesture but it covered half of the table.. sucks for the third person in our party. We then had to ask three times for water.. and by 3 times I mean it took 45 minutes.   We also had some drink issues. I asked for a margarita on the rocks and when she brought it, she said \"I just put ice in the frozen one\" ....k. Our Jim beam lemonade (the actual name of the drink) was just pure sour mix. They even forgot the alcohol. It was LIME GREEN. Both drinks got sent back in favor of wine - one of us ordered a glass before the other discovered we could get a bottle for less. Could not cancel the glass. \"I can't send it back again\" was actually said.   The food was good but portioned out for 3-7 year olds. The chicken tacos (meal) were 3 tortillas the size of the bottom of a pint glass. The steak was $30 and the size of my palm. The octopus was very good until I involuntarily threw it up a few hours later. Not a drill.   It was also really exciting when it rained. Does it rain much in Montreal? Because the staff does not know how to handle it. They ran around clearing the empty tables of utensils and left us and our food in the rain lol. lol. We moved our own items including chairs, table, and the marbled bottom umbrella while they quite literally watched. Again, lol.  I asked for the check when the food arrived mostly because we were there for 2 hours before the food came and we assume itd take just as long for everything else. Assumption was accurate.   I'd skip this place. Cool vibe but should probably consider hiring trained wait staff that isn't bottle girls running around in poorly fitted bra dresses, mingling with men at tables rather than actually waiting tables. I mean, just a thought?"}
{"text":"C'est le pire endroit que j'ai jamais fait! J'avais réservé un mois à l'avance pour mon anniversaire, confirmé quelques jours avant et voilà que 3h avant l'évènement, soit a 15h de l'après-midi, on me dit qu'il faut que le plus gros du groupe de 30 personnes arrive avant 19h45 sinon plus de réservation et qu'on devra quitter la table 2h après. L'accueil, le service était horrible, pas de sourire, on a eu l'impression de les gêner, on s'est fait virer de notre table alors qu'il n'y avait encore personne dans le club! Dans la soirée, idem le staff n'a pas été aimable du tout du tout...  Worst place ever! We were supposed to be downstairs, we went upstairs because I don't know who decides it. I booked earlier in the month all the night for my birthday for 30 people and 3 hours before it, they said that we couldn't stay there for more than 2 hours!  The service was horrible, rude, no smile, no welcome.... We felt like we annoy them! For the club, same thing, the staff was horrible...."}
{"text":"The location is perfect on the water in Old Montreal.  On warm summer evenings you get the cooling breeze off the Saint Lawrence.  Everything is open and airy.  There are two areas, the patio with all the tables for food and drinks and then the club itself on a few floors.    The portion sizes are pretty small for the price of the meal and it isn't that great.  I suggest getting a lot of platters to share.  They have a lot of choices for the drinks such as various creations of martinis.  They also serve champagne cocktails as well.  The club plays a variety of music from hip hop to house to trance to reggaeton it suits a diverse mixture of people.  The crowd is a eclectic mix of all that Montreal has to offer.  As stated before, its perfect on a warm summer night to enjoy the breezes.  The top floor is for bottle service and has nice couches to chill and relax.    It's a different night out than the usual."}
{"text":"Would not let me in to eat lunch and have beer on patio with a tank top in summer. All the woman were sleeveless though!"}
{"text":"Probably a great place for a night time drink. Not so much for a meal. The decor is okay but there were a lot of bugs and broken glass in the cabanas. Odd they chose not to address that when we pointed it out. Food is ok at best. The view from the dining area is poor as it is sunken. So there is no river view. You are better off going across the street to a proper restaurant."}
{"text":"Crap! If I could put a less than one star, I would certainly do.   Don't spoil special events here. They are just taking advantage of the location and there is zero customer care by this place. The staffs are so rude, they look into your eyes and telling you it is what it is, and you can leave if you don't want what we are."}
{"text":"Lovely place. Very nice staff. Great drinks and fun ambiance. The prices of the drinks are good for the amount they provide. I recommend trying their sangrias."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Service was slow, waitress was extremely rude. That was the dinner part. As for the club, staff pushes you around and one of them cussed at us. The owner did not care and didn't do anything. To the owner: learn to run your business, you are doing a horrible job and are in need of a refresh on customer service. Take it from me go somewhere else this place is an absolute nightmare!"}
{"text":"Arrivé vers 23:00 nous avons recu une btl de vin chaude a notre table... En fait, la notre n'etait plus disponible et nous en avons été avisé 40 min apres l'avoir commandé... Service médiocre, long et tres ordinaire! Honetement je vous déconseille cet endroit si vous voulez passer une belle soirée car tout les gens pres de nous on attendu plus de 30 min pour leurs consommations! Le personnel n'est pas bien formé et le gérant s'obstine avec les clients qui sont insatisfaits... Oubliez cet endroit !!!"}
{"text":"Really not a fan of the wait that comes with this popular restaurant, but I guess that's what is to be expected with such a crowded spot. It's right by the water and all outdoors, so it's popular this time of year for good reason. It also has a nice dj pumping some club music to get the vibes going too. People dress like they are going to the club here..one thing my coworker's and I did not come prepared for..  We had some glasses of red wine and ordered after waiting for our waitress forever. The charcuterie board was delicious and of good portion, and the kale and goat cheese salad was also another great healthy starter. The beets in this salad were tasty and sweet.   I also got the grilled salmon, which was kind of small and really salty. We also ordered another round of our reds, which I noticed I received a much different tasting glass the second time around..so now I have no idea which red I ended up drinking...  Our waitress was nice, just expect the service to be slow at first and waiting in line for a table beforehand. Come dressed to impressed and ready to party. It's a good spot for drinks and very small plates before going out."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to have a drink and relax before going for a ride on the Ferris wheel, and Terrace Bonsecours seemed like the best option. It was an experience, how to say this hum ... interesting, because it has confirmed several things to me including stuff about myself: A) A pitch of sangria at the price of $ 30, does not necessarily mean that the content will be of quality (*cough cough* kool-aid) B) A lounge bar with such an idyllic location does not mean that the clientele will be as consistent C) As I get older, soirées populated of under 21s are not really my thing  Needless to say that I will not go back but at least I tried."}
{"text":"They luck out on having a great spot in Montreal's old port. Unfortunately there are no other pros. Even for a Tuesday evening service was slow and casual. Drinks were served quickly but the \"tapas style\" food was not worth the trip. All 3 of our orders came out at varied times (make that 2 out of 3 as it wasn't until everyone got their food that they mentioned they were out of whatever I had ordered). We barely saw our server throughout our stay but she made a lasting impression when she mentioned to a friend that a 15% tip wasn't included - note that this was after she had already been tipped over 15% by said friend.   The food itself came in the teeniest tapa portion I've seen and cost the price of what could be a full meal.  Overall generally unimpressed. :("}
{"text":"Le décor est super et les cocktails sont vraiment bons, par contre, préparez-vous  à de très petites portions pour la nourriture (surtout les hamburgers). Le prix est élevé. L'endroit est très bien situé en plein au vieux port de Montréal (10 minutes de marche de la station champs de mars) et pour le parking c'est payant. La musique est assez bien et les terrasses sont grandes. Le service est cool. C'est super pour les groups et annif :)"}
{"text":"Vraiment un beau club éphemère à montréal ! La terrasse est super belle et l'ambiance est vraiment cool ! Je n'ai pas essayé la nourriture, mais j'ai bien apprécié les drinks. Le fait que la terrasse soit sur le bord de l'eau dans le vieux port donne vraiment un aspect unique à ce bar.   Bref , je vais y retourner c'est promis !"}
{"text":"This was recommended as a casual place to eat with good food and great atmosphere.  It was neither.  First the food. Tappas style plates at main course prices and very limited selection.    I went with 2 friends.  we each had the greek salad (there was virtually no other choice) no lettuce, bland dressing. not very good.  Main course, I had a tuna tartar, it was diced tuna on top of a mango 'dressing' if you will. bland and uninspiring. Other friend had the rare steak strips and he said they were very good. again small portions but big price  We shared a nice bottle of wine.   Service was excellent  But the worst part of it all was the atmosphere.  its a long haul there from downtown but thought it would be worth it cause it was on the port near the water.  but you could see nothing, just have soon been surrounded by a parking lot.    That was not the worst of it. There were piping loud obnoxious, techno inspired pop music. this is at 7 pm mind you not late in the evening.  it is hard to describe how much that ruined the evening. if it were me and my wife i would have left right there. But we soldiered on. it could have been the best food in the world and i would not have enjoyed it.  if that was not bad enough there were smokers all around us  This place is utterly charmless. there are dozens and dozens of good, charming restaurants in Montreal, if you are over 30 avoid this place like the plague. if you are under 30 and enjoy this type of restaurant, examine your life"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and each time I  have felt I was missing my entourage, yacht party and boom box entering in. I came here on a Sunday with a friend to grab a drink (even though the sangrias are legit over priced at 30$ a pitcher serving diluted water down kool-aid) . The location and the decor are impeccable. The points drop with the loud music and very young crowd. I had no idea that people deck out in clubbing gear on a Sunday night- I guess Bonsecours equates to the Vegas of Mtl."}
{"text":"Worst experience. We made a reservation, got there only to find out we were not on their list. Lucky for us they were able to get us a table... the worst one they had!!!! The table was tiny, there were fruit flies EVERYWHERE ( I understand its a terrasse but come on!!!) they had to add a chair to accomodate us (i had to push my chair every 3 seconds so that the waiters could actually do their job). After about 15 min we asked the host to get us a new table if possible and she said she would get us the next one available. Well it turns out she did give the table but not to us... she gave it to those \"no reservation\" blonde bimbos who are friends with the manager. 15 min passed and still no service so we just decided to leave. It was really disappointing as there was alot of hype about this place. Only go there if you know the manager."}
{"text":"Ce qui s'annonçait une belle soirée s'est avéré un véritable fiasco.   Le service était vraiment pitoyable considérant en plus que la terrasse était à moitié vide.  Nous étions 4 et avons tous commandé un plat. Seulement une personne a reçu son plat après un certain temps, un tartare de boeuf qui était séché couleur brun foncé et avait l'air d'avoir été laissé sur le comptoir depuis une journée. Nous avons informé la serveuse de reprendre l'assiette, puis elle nous a mentionné qu'elle avait effectivement avisé les cuisiniers et le manager car l'assiette avait déjà été rapporté par un client précédent, et ils lui ont dit d'apporter l'assiette au client malgré tout. c'est inacceptable.  Puis nous avons attendus 45 minutes avant de recevoir les 3 autres plats. Lorsque nous avons fait signe à la serveuse que nous n'avions toujours pas reçu nos plats, elle nous a dit qu'elle nous amènerait quelque chose d'autre. (?). Finalement, lorsque nous les avons reçus, ce n'était pas ce que nous avions commandé.   Nous avons demandé à la serveuse de parler au manager. Après 2 demandes, ce dernier n'a jamais voulu venir à notre table (ce dernier prétextait être trop occupé, mais on le voyait parler à un groupe de pitounes toute la soirée).  Bref, lorsque nous nous sommes plaint à la serveuse, elle nous a dit que le manager nous offrait un round de shot.(?) Et qu'elle allait déduire le tartare de boeuf (que nous avions retournés). Pour finir, la serveuse a essayé de nous charger les assiettes que nous n'avions jamais reçus et j'ai du retourner 2 fois la facture pour surcharge de quelconque item que nous n'avions pas pris.  Quelle soirée agréable! *sarcasme*  JAMAIS PLUS je n'y retournerai. Cet établissement n'a aucun respect pour ses clients. Cela se démontre par l'attitude du manager qui n'a même pas daigné venir voir ses clients lorsqu'il y a un problème.  À FUIR!"}
{"text":"I feel I am somewhere down south. Outdoor and all the plants around, a perfect place for the summer. The music is fun. The service is very helpful and amiable. Our waitress Anesthesia recommended us the sangria with champagne. The drinks were tasted so delicious and it was refreshing. The stars go down, the food was very bland. More flavor needed."}
{"text":"Wow je vois qu'il y a déjà beaucoup d'avis négatifs, à mon tour de créer le mien! Nous avions réservé pour 30 personnes (événement corpo) en terrasse pour un 5@7 le 7 juillet. Pour faire court: - nous avons eu une table pour 12 personnes max (une chance que beaucoup sont restés debout et étaient ok avec ça) - pour la plupart d'entre nous, nous avons attendu 1h (oui oui, 1h) notre 1e drink - il y avait 2 ou 3 serveuses sur le plancher, pour environ 100 clients - on avait des coupons payés d'avance par notre compagnie, qu'on ne pouvait pas utiliser au bar, alors qu'il n'y avait personne au bar - on devait attendre notre serveuse, qui est passée 1 fois en 1h et qu'on n'a plus jamais revu, à moins de lui courir après si on l'apercevait - du coup on n'osait pas commander à manger en se disant que ça allait prendre encore 1h - toutes nos drinks étaient longues à arriver, et ce jusqu'à 20h environ Ça laisse un gout amer et surtout pas l'envie d'y retourner!"}
{"text":"I have had some bad experiences in the past, but never so bad i felt compelled to write a yelp review. The process of downloading the yelp app and creating an account was painfully slow, but it was definitevely worth it if this review makes this sleazy business lose even a single client. Where to start, the sassy waitress who felt it was necessary to be rude despite not having a table ready 50 min after my resevation. We were told to sit at the bar and that they would call us once the table was ready. What she didn't mention is that there was no room at the bar and she expected us to stand around in a corner. It was clear that nobody had any idea how to organise a reservation system. The hostess, on top of the constant rudeness, was more confused than a hungry baby at a topless bar.  This place is to bars what donald trump is to politics, pretentious, dumb, and dishonest. Avoid the bar and avoid people who like it."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service in the world. Great location, good cocktails, reasonable prices... But stay away. After getting our cocktails we watched another table get up to leave before being served. The server never came back to check on us. After our drinks were empty we waited 15 minutes until we finally had to yell across two tables to get out check. Now the server had plenty of time to actually stand at our table side waiting for a tip, she informed us that most people leave 15%.  We have traveled extensively and never have I had service this bad AND RUDE."}
{"text":"Been there twice. Both times same horrible experience. Food came at unacceptable times, one friend both times did not each until 30 minutes after we had all moved on to sipping their consistently watered down and over priced booze. The waitress had no idea what was going on with our food, in fact I paid my bill about 5 seconds before the last plate showed up. After having two friends work their as models that serve, I can ensure you the staff here are treated little better than dogs. Nothing but a sleezy place made by some money hungry bros.   Only reason you should go here is to order $5K of booze on the last day it's open and then not pay your order cause karma's a bitch."}
{"text":"The staff is RUDE and The service here is terrible. Also their hours aware wrong on Yelp..beware. Actually just don't waste your time trying this place..."}
{"text":"Came here for a 5 à 7 after work hangout and we reserved for a large group. We initially had problems with our sitting arrangement because not everyone arrived at the same time. Food was not really worth it for its price, the drinks were alright but service was very slow and they told us that it was because of their machine. I can understand that, but when other tables are are getting served before us, it's kind of frustrating. I ordered a half-pitcher of a drink but it took so long for me to get it that they were nice enough to give me a whole pitcher for the price of the half. Because it is quite a popular spot, service can definitely be slow. Overall, nice hangout spot for a drink, I did enjoy myself but wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Can I have my money back please?  The WORST PLACE in MTL. Seriously.  I'm a local and I've only been there once when they opened years ago and I went back today 5 years later only to remember why I had never been back.  It all started at with the host sitting us right by the entrance where all the traffic is while the whole place is empty.   Our waiter showed up 1.5 seconds after being seated to take our drink and food order all that while twitching and mumbling something... I was confused.  Then the Sangria was 99% juice.  Food was super dry and crazy overprice for the tiny portions.  Then while I sat there eating, 6... Yes 6 people asked me if I was done and tried to take my plate away (me mouth full, cutting food!!) I'm super vexed.  They legit hired 73 cute (with terrible shoes and all in serious need of a pedicure) 19 year olds who have no service experience to serve shitty tapas and even shittier drinks.   I feel robbed."}
{"text":"We ordered a bottle and literally had the worst waitress ever we gave her a tip to reflect her attitude and service (10%) she then came back and said I usually get 15% and then began to make us explain ourselves why we gave her a bad tip.... She then said well fine I need to call the manger we explained the situation and he was understating and we got  a new waitress...."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, rude and unfriendly staff. I had a reservation for my birthday at 6:30 Saturday evening. I've explicitly asked them if the rain would be a problem and they told me not to worry. I've arrived and they assigned me a table without any shade or ceiling and shower started. I've asked them to change our table and they told me sorry we cannot do anything. There are other available seats under the shade but they told me that they have been reserved. I left !!! Basically ruined my day !!!!"}
{"text":"Les cocktails sont bons  , les plats que je commandé  était correct  mais rien d'extra pour le prix que j'ai payé  Une autre  fois j'ai  été au club de la terasse bonsecour j' ai été vraiment déçu .La musique était mauvaise . L'ambiance était trop jeune de  15 - 18 ans"}
{"text":"This is a great idea in concept.  Ridiculously poor execution, service, price...basically everything but location.  Food/Drinks - Overpriced...badly made  Service - Oh so bad.  Rude staff that is too busy to serve people.  The bar was empty, except for a lot of bees around (because Montreal) and we were trying to order a bottle of champagne.  We told the bartender after waiting there for her for about 10 minutes...she gave us the one finger up. Continued to talk to other people who had already had their drink. They finished their drink and she got them a second before even coming up to us and asking us which bottle of champagne we wanted.  Then she gets us said champagne, no glasses.  We get glasses eventually (champagne is still on ice but now 30 minutes have passed since we got to the bar). One of the glasses have ACTUAL glass pieces in it...could kill us.  I tell them...no apology..no care that I could have just died from drinking glass...she just took away the glass and NO REPLACEMENT.  I had to remind her I needed that new glass, finally get one, then we can open the champagne.  Needless to say her tip was less than my normal generosity...it should have been non-existent.  Price - Overpriced for everything...even if Service and decor was fantastic...still high.  Decor - REALLY crowded and kind of run down.  They do not take care of the furniture outside or clean up the space after guests leave quickly at all.  The entire time we were there, a table left and was never cleaned up.  Notable Extra - Just location"}
{"text":"Très bel endroit, je vais devoir revenir, car nous sommes passés durant un évènement et nous y avons seulement consommé de la bière, mais je suis satisfaite de ma soirée! Le staff était super accueillant, et malgré la quantité de monde, ils réussissaient à nous servir dans un délai raisonnable!   Je suggère vraiment l'endroit pour prendre un verre l'été! C'est en plein milieu du Vieux-Port donc même la vue est super!"}
{"text":"Sunday Funday- boozy brunch is how locals describe this place. Security everywhere and doormen and it's only 6pm. Lower level has a bar and tables ( reservations suggested ) upper level is more relaxed, long bar, high Top tables with views of the port. ( Kodak moment) and views of lower level. Music is electronic/ house/ loungey. Not terribly loud. Friendly service. The biggest surprise was the POUR. It's not freehand or bartenders discretion. It's computerized. So if your drink isn't \" strong \" enough, be ready to pay for more/ shot. This is the ONLY place I have seen using this technology. Bought a small pitcher of sangria $22 and not strong as I'm used to in Nyc. Oh well- it's canada. Good for date - casual hangout. Dress code was all over the place. 3 stars for bartender Pascal. MINUS 2FOR RUDE BLONDE WAITRESS STATING A BUSBOY SHOULD HAVE HELD MY SANGRIA AS I WALKED FROM UPPER LEVEL TO LOWER."}
{"text":"Great place for hanging out with your friends, especially when the weather is nice. Also, if you're a sangria lover, this is the place! They have tons sangria choices. I really like this place because of the amazing view and good music. Note their food is quite average."}
{"text":"Amazing place for summer drinks, and best place to be during the summer. Music, staff, food, and SANGRIA are the things that make you  want summer to come back sooner!!"}
{"text":"Visited the nightclub portion of this business with a group of guys visiting Montreal for a bachelor party. From the outside this place oversees a great view of the city, but the service is awful and not worth the view. We arrived early in the night around 10pm where there were only a handful of people in the club. Ordered a bottle from the bottle service menu and received terrible service. We were disappointed to find out that there was no seating or lounge section for bottle service if less than 3 bottles were purchased. Our waitress was rude and didn't bother to check on us to refill our mixers (juices and tonic). Our tip reflected the service as we only gave 10% on a $200+ bill. The waitress returned with our money and told us that this was far less than what is customary and said 15% is average. After a brief conversation with her manager, it was determined that 10% was extremely generous.   The bathroom at this facility is probably the most disgusting thing I have ever witnessed. It is no where connected to the club and you must walk outside and into a basement of another building next door. The basement is poorly lit and clearly has not been disinfected in quite some time. The aroma you get as soon as you walk halfway down the stairs is extremely putrid.   The DJ played good dance music and once the night progressed the club filled up with patrons.   I think rating this place 1 star was even too generous."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allées aux terrasses cette année pour leur ouverture. Lorsque j'ai appelé pas moyen de réserver une table, ils avaient un gros événement. Alors on m'a dit de me présenter sur place et d'attendre qu'une table se libère, j'ai tout de même mis mon nom sur liste d'attente. Arrivées la, nous étions 3, il a fallu attendre devant la réceptionniste avant de trouver une table. Après 10 minutes d'attente, je lui ai rappelé notre existence, ils semblaient tous débordés et un peu perdus. Elle s'est souvenu de nous, a cru trouver une table, mais déjà prise. Mon amie qui regardait la salle lui a signalé qu'elle en voyait une plus loin et ainsi mon amie pris les devants afin de s'assurer qu'elle était libre. Nous étions installées !! L'ambiance était génial, beaucoup trop de monde au niveau de la terrasse en bas, mais bon c'est une ouverture. Le DJ vraiment super, les gens se laissaient aller sur la musique. Nous avons été servi par Maxime. Excellent service de sa part ! Toujours alerte et attentif à nos demandes et nous en avions : plus de pain, sel, des napkins, encore de l'alcool. Il a franchement bien assuré et nous le sentions toujours présent. Je recommande la sangria champagne un vrai délice. Pour ce qui est de la nourriture, de niveau commerciale. Je n'ai pas été impressionnée, mais cela passe bien pour un 5 à 7. Le tartare de saumon était bien, mais sans plus. Et pour ce qui de l'entrée variée : tapenade, humus et bruschetta, on avait l'impression que c'était des produits achetés au IGA, je n'ai pas eu l'impression que c'était fait maison et j'en doute. Puis, nous avons dansé au rythme de la musique dance-house-electro du DJ, c'était vraiment super agréable!! A la fin de la soirée, j'ai repéré un employé à l'entrée qui s'occupait de gérer la foule. Je me suis dit qu'il s'agissait peut -être d'un des proprio. En me présentant il m'indique qu'il travaille là, je lui réponds que je tenais à lui signifier que j'avais passer une super soirée et que travaillant dans l'industrie hôtelière je passerais le mot à mes collègues. Je n'ai jamais vu une personne se montrer aussi indifférente face à des mots positifs. J'ai été déçue par la réaction et me suis dit que vraisemblablement les Terrasses n'en avait rien à faire du bouche à oreille. Grave erreur! Par ailleurs, je finis en notant que le nightclub attire encore une clientèle bien jeune à mon avis. Si vous cherchez un endroit raffiné, tourner vos talons et allez ailleurs."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend that wanted to try this place. WORST IDEA. After waiting a while, we had to ask to order, since the waitress seemed to be too busy serving alcohol to \"better clients\". When we order, she seemed not appreciating the fact we didn't order alcoholic drinks and only took a plate each. \"It's pretty small, you know\" she added when we ordered in a condescending way. And then, to pay, it was the same thing. We had to ask someone if we could have the bill after waiting a long time. But, this time she was faster ;-)   The food was horrible. In fact, we are both suffering of food poisoning...  I'll never go back. Never."}
{"text":"Terrasse Bonsecour is located right in the heart of the Old Port.  It's a beautiful spot in summer so if you want a four or five star experience here, come, admire the view and leave because after that it goes downhill very quickly.  Everything here is as overpriced as it gets.  We were a group so we ordered a few sangria pitchers.  They were all very weak and overly sweet and just not worth the $30 price tag.    Unfortunately the food was no better.  They boast a tapas menu but the portions are so small that you can really only share with one person tops if you hope to have any food yourself.  I actually left still hungry and had to stop for a burger on my way home.  I also found the food to be bland and uninspiring.  A grilled asparagus tapas dish seemed to have no seasoning whatsoever and the beef tacos I ordered were dry and lacking flavour.  Once again the dishes were vastly overpriced given the portion size and quality.  Now the real issue I have with Terrasse Bonsecours is the obvious double standards that they have for their employees regarding the dress code.  The male employees wear standard polo shirts and pants while the female employees have to wear high heels and super-tight, skimpy dresses that don't leave much to the imagination.  This was pretty darn sexist if you ask me.  To top it off the service was all over the place.  First up we were given two menus when we were a group of 10.  Let me tell you that that doesn't work very well.  It also took quite some time to do standard things like place an order or get a bill.   I have to say that despite its stellar location the Terrasse Bonsecours is not worth the visit.  Save your money and go elsewhere."}

I suggested we go here since we were in old port and didn't want to travel far. We should have travelled further...  We first had 2 glasses of sparkling wine which took forever to be served. And not just a long time for drinks, but a long time for anything to be served at a restaurant. We also had 2 salmon tartares and a salad to share. The tartare was ok but Montreal has so many great tartares, why settle for that? They served it with 3 pieces of bread soaked in butter so it was soggy - it was terrible. The salad was also just ok with the vinaigrette being too sweet. Overall, it was really mediocre food with a price well above that.  They do have a nice terasse but it's not worth the overpriced food you get with it."}
{"text":"Portions are  small and ridiculously over priced. Super loud and bad music playing as you eat which really ruins the whole ambiance. Food was alright and sangria was good. Would not recommend."}
