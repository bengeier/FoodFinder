{"text":"I can't tell you how hard it is to find \"New York\" pizza that actually lives up to its name, and Carmine's has hit the mark! Excellent pizza that snaps when you fold it, great cheese and crust. The service was friendly,  bathrooms clean, dining area charming...definitely returning!"}
{"text":"Just really mediocre and slightly overpriced.  My sub sandwich had salami, ham, and cheese, a slice of tomato and a few pieces of lettuce...boring.  As for ambiance...how about dust covered plastic grapes hanging from the ceiling, and a fat guy (Carmine himself) sitting at the front table talking loud.  It was like a scene from one of those restaurant renovation shows.  Don't bother."}
{"text":"Was a little taken by how quiet the restaurant was and waited what seemed like forever for the food after ordering.

However, my 11 year old twins , my husband and myself would wholeheartedly agree - worth the wait! 

The food was so flavorful, hot and delicious.  The most courteous and attentive wait staff.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We just love it here!! Yummy pizza and subs! Ally is our favorite server there- one of the main reasons we come!! !! Always great service! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We have been making our rounds for pizza, and have had some real wins....this however was not one of them.  We went for dinner, and although the reviews were mixed, - we decided to try it.  I think like the majority of the reviews, we should of went for $1 slices.  After eating - I wish I had only paid $1 a slice instead of the amount we did for the Large pizza we had. 

We ordered the Carmines special on 1/2 and on the other half the meat lovers (not on the menu but advised from a Yelper)  The Meat lovers side was better.  Still lacking the flavor and what the other guys have.  OK Ill say it.....I wish we had just grabbed a Costco Pizza - it would of satisfied me more than this.

Staff was friendly - although....when you see a $7.50 (YES 7.50!!!) Glass of wine with a sip out of it and still on the table, full at dinners end, ask if everything was ok with the wine.  Ordered a Cabernet, did not realize it was $7.50 until the check and could not drink it.  It was pretty bad...and not worth the price. 

Overall - I would of rated this place probably higher had I had $1 slices...the expectation would of exceeded the value.  I feel guilty and upset we spent what we did for 2 glasses of horrible wine and a large pizza......not worth it and frustrating."}
{"text":"Will NEVER go there again! The only reason we traveled half way across town to check this place out was because i got a good deal through Groupon and wanted to try the food. Bad idea! Me and my daughter went there for lunch on a Monday afternoon. We were the ONLY ones in the whole place (now I know why!).  When we walked in the place was nothing special and no one greeted us or sat us at a table.  We waited for what seemed like 5 minutes before some guy came out from the kitchen and reluctantly took our order.  We asked him about the lunch special that was clearly posted on the outside window but he had no idea what it included.  

We should've just left then, but I wanted to use the Groupon that I purchased and would probably not be on this side of town any time soon.  After he took our order, we sat ourselves down and about 5 minutes or so went by before a waitress came out to ask if we needed anything.  She brought us drinks and never came back until the food was done.  Both the appetizer and the main dish were both greasy and bland.  The food was definitely not anything to return for.  We waited and waited for refills on our drinks but the waitress never returned and we had to go get the attention of someone out of the kitchen to get our drinks refilled. 

I didn't think things could get worse, but once the bill came they did!  I showed the waitress the Groupon voucher on my phone (like I have been doing at numerous establishments for the past two years) and she had no idea what I was trying to show her.  She immediately got rude with me and asked me \"who sent that to you??\". I tried to explain how Groupon works, since she obviously lives under a rock, but she just acted like I was being ridiculous and giving her some kind of \"fake\" coupon.  When I finally made her understand that my phone was the actual voucher, she was even more rude than before.  Her exact words were \"what am i supposed to do with that?! How am i supposed to scan it??? THIS ISN'T A GROCERY STORE!!\" Wooooow! I couldn't believe my ears. How could she talk to me like that just because SHE didn't know what to do?? Is it my fault she lives in the stone ages and has no clue how to get a coupon off of my phone?!? She just kept telling me that \"they don't use that company any more\" and \"I don't think we can take that\".  She refused to even deal with me and my stupid phone coupon.  I had to pay the entire bill and was unable to use my Groupon.  

The service was horrible even before I presented the coupon and it got 10 times worse after, I would not recommend this place to anyone! I will contact Groupon tomorrow and get my money back (because THEY have great customer service!) and I WILL NOT BE STEPPING FOOT IN CARMINES EVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"The service is incredible & the food is delicious.  Friendly smiling staff.  Comfortable seating area.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Went with a party of 6.  Service was great everyone liked their food.  The hot eggplant sandwich was wonderful.  Pizza, pasta chopped salad all wonderful.  We will be back what a neighborhood find.  Also a plus waitress very helpful and separate checks not a problem."}
{"text":"See Note Below-It's tough to get pizza that I like in Las Vegas but Carmine's Pizza Kitchen is great!! My son and I had lunch there. The pizza was large, thin crust, great taste and well done like we requested. No tomato chunks in the sauce and it wasn't extra spicy like most Vegas pizza. Quick service. Will be going back soon. 
NOTE: Sep/2011-This place has new owners, not Carmines any more and the pizza is not as good as when it was Carmines!! Review adjusted."}
{"text":"I really like coming here with my kids after school. The pizza is fantastic and especially that they have 1$ slices until 4pm. However, today we happened to walk in at 3:55 and before I even went to give my order, the girl with the short bob blonde hair told me we only have 3 slices of pizza left. I responded and said you only have 3 slices of pizza in the whole store?! Her response was for the 1$ slices. I think she was very rude talking to me like that and then she responded for the 1$ slices. I didn't know there was a limited quantity of pizza for the 1$ slice special however I think she could have been a little bit nicer."}
{"text":"Closest to my NY pizza yet. Been Here five years from NY. How come I didn't find it sooner?  Awesome. Can't wait to bring my daughter here. Maybe tonight"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch! $1 cheese slices. Plus the girls that work the front are very sweet and professional. Love this place."}
{"text":"My sister ordereed this pizza the other night and it was really good, hot and fresh. The ranch is good too, It tasted home made. The people seemed nice and the service was fast. I think we waited maybe 15- 20 minutes for 3 pizzas and wings , The kids ate the pizza too and loved it. We will be back again:)"}
{"text":"Came over for a dinner and was rather disappointed. We ordered eggplant parm and chicken parm sandwiches. Both were pretty bland and bread was hard. For the price you don't even get a side so we had to pay almost $5 for french fries basket. Not sure about their pizza but I doubt we'll ever be back."}
{"text":"When you can put 3 toppings and extra cheese on a extra large Pizza and the crust is still crisp, and the sauce still dominant you got yourself someone who can make pie. Take the drive it's worth it."}
{"text":"The best food in the world. Everything we ate was excellent. Great service and very nice people"}
{"text":"At least once a month I crave Spaghetti but not just any Spaghetti. I need my NY style red sauce Spaghetti...plain and yummy. I've tried many places in the valley and it's all been a fail. I saw this place 2 weeks ago and decided to give it a try. Yayyyy...I found it. What awesome Spaghetti and they serve it with fresh bread. Imagine that. I'm originally from NY and this place feels like home. Next time I want Pizza I'm going here for a slice. If you're into fast food or national pizza chains this might not be for you. LOL. Just kidding they have something for everyone."}
{"text":"This place is great!! Dollar slices wow!! I feel like I'm back home NYC!!  I have dined at all the other Carmine's in town and know they have quality food and Awesome service!!  I highly recommend this Resturant!!"}
{"text":"I tried carmine's for the first time. It was delicious well worth the money. I'm glad I gave it a try. Way better than chain restaurant pizzas."}
{"text":"THE REAL DEAL. If you're one of those people who's always saying, \"You can't get pizza like you can in Brooklyn,\" you must try Carmine's -- which a gal from the dog park (also a NY transplant) highly recommended.

Perfect. Crust, the sauce, the fact that an extra large pie really is an extra large pie -- and at $25, a bargain compared to the other \"nicer\" pizza joints.

I had to add red onion & oregano to my Greek salad when I got home (we Greeks are fussy about our Greek salads), but that's fine. BECAUSE THE PIZZA WAS FANTASTIC. I actually ordered 1/2 Melanese, 1/2 Carmine's special, so I can say both were delicious. Next time I'm eating in, because it just feels like a cozy neighborhood spot -- hard to find in this town."}
{"text":"Chopped Salad was delish!  And the chicken fingers were equally good.  Service was friendly and fast.  No reason not to keep coming back to this neighborhood pizza joint."}
{"text":"Being a pizza expert this place has a very good pizza for the west coast. Crust could be a little thinner but the homemade sauce more than makes up for it. Great staff and terrific value. 2 slices and drink 4.99. I will be back."}
{"text":"Eh, it was ok..
I'm glad we got their 1 slice for a buck to try it out.
I was expecting a thin, floppy slice instead it was light cheese, bland tomato sauce, stiff bit will say the crust had a nice crust. Maybe this is some sort of pizza a certain city like Chicago eats but I wasn't loving it. 
I will say, I did it eat it once I layered the parm on it.
Also they say they are the founders of Villa Pizza. I don't  think Villa pizza here in Vegas unless their recipe is now different. Still the staff was very friendly, the place is well decorated, prices decent..
probably just not my kind of pizza. 

good luck staying open (:"}
{"text":"Thought I would try there pizza and I will never order there again.  A simple Pepperoni Pizza with cheese and it was horrible. Very bland and no taste at all. There was a very strange taste to it!!??    I was very disappointed and was hoping for a better result.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza with meatball, olives and mushrooms. The crust was thin and crisp with a nice chew, very good crust.  Nice , sweet tomato sauce . Overall very good pizza.  I also had the sausage w/ linguine in tomato sauce. The sausage was very tasty and tender . The tomato sauce was top notch  and the portion was large . Service was good ."}
{"text":"very good pizza love the crispy crust. and for a slice @ lunch $1 WOW!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had slices and they were very good, I would make dough a little thinner and it would be on point!!!  Clean restaurant and friendly staff."}
{"text":"had a teriffic veggie pizza & amazing Tiramsiu - actually the best Tiramsiu west of Europe"}
{"text":"I Love this place, from the $1 slices to the Chopped Salad, could eat here all the time. Only time I wasn't happy was when I got the Spaghetti and meatballs and they tasted like straight black pepper, but we called and talked to Tito and he apologized and gave us a credit for it next time. I recommend it to anyone looking for amazing food."}
{"text":"great food, top pizza in town, carmine vento is a pizza legend in vegas! founder of villa pizza (no longer owns anymore)! also check out his re opened remodeled restaurant on Marks/Warm Springs next to the sunset station!

pizza has tasty mozzarella, sweet tomato sauce, white taste in that crust, brick oven cooked made to perfection! great dine in deal lunch time around $7.99 i believe?"}
{"text":"Coming from new england this has to be the best pizza I have had in Vegas yet and I am a pizza snob. It had flavor, a good crunch, yummy cheese and sauce. I can't give it a full 5 star because it's not new england pizza by any means but I will definitely be getting my pizza here."}
{"text":"I LOVE Carmine's Pizza Kitchen! Best pizza and food! 

In response to John M. below, I have been going to all of Carmine's restaurants for over 35 years here in the Las Vegas valley. I am absolutely shocked at your experience. I have only ever felt as if I am in nothing but a family atmosphere. After all these years I find it very difficult to believe what you're saying. And, why would he give you $20 of he only owed you $4.05?"}
{"text":"Carmine's is the BOMB-DIGGITY! A California transplant, I was discussing with a fellow bar patron where I might find a decent pizza, and he highly recommended Carmine's. When I called to ask if they delivered, the man who answered (I assumed the owner, but after picking up my pizza, I could see that the employees simply have pride in the restaurant--always a good thing) discouraged the delivery service as the pizza might not be as hot as he would like it.  They could do it, but if there was any way we could pick it up, we would be much more satisfied. We like an \"all-meat marvel,\" so we ordered pepperoni, Italian sausage, and (yum!) sliced meatball. It was ready in ten minutes...hot out of the oven. Sauce is perfect...light, not overwhelming, thin crust, and lots of cheese. By the way, we were told, upon picking up our reasonably priced pizza, that during lunch time, generous slices are $1, and the very courteous manager handed us a menu that made us just want to say \"yes.\""}
{"text":"Delicious but seems to get pretty busy at lunch! Had the personal cheese pizza and lasagna, both were so good, definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered an XL pepperoni from here yesterday as Niko's pizza had an hour wait time and was not disappointed. First let me say that the pizza was HUGE and they were kind enough to double slice it for me into 16 pieces and was ready in 20 minutes. The pie itself was delicious not too much of anything well balanced. Their ranch is crack sooo good I was drowning my pizza in it, just wished they didn't charge so much for it."}
{"text":"Have never been to this place before tonight. We ordered our food to-go and everything was perfect. Got a Greek salad and chicken parmesan. The Greek salad dressing was awesome and the chicken parmesan was cooked perfectly. Definitely gonna be a new go-to when we don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"This family owned pizza spot is the BEST... I love their food!!!! I love the staff ... I go as often as possible. Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"First time trying the pizza. Pizza was pretty good, I'm super disappointed that they forgot to add one of my toppings, and i was still charged for it."}
{"text":"Good basic pizza, really nice service. Everything we had tasted fresh, and the place was super clean. We will defintely be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in for some dinner tonight for the first time.  We ordered an XL veggie pizza & a couple of iced teas.  LOVE LOVE LOVE the hot, stringy melted cheese, super generous fresh toppings and my personal fav, their crust.  Its nice & crisp but still chewy and just so yummy!  Highly recommend dining in.  The owner is part of the original Villa Pizza fam, hot damn they know their pizza!"}
{"text":"This place is a small restaurant, but that doesn't stop it from having amazing food. My sorority had a social at the jazzercise place in the same plaza, and we needed to grub. So we stopped in and basically took over the entire restaurant. The waiter and waitress easily accommodated to all of us, and seeing as how there were so many of us, the customer service was phenomenal. 

We ordered a xl pizza which they offered to cut into some extra slices for us because we were all splitting a pizza.  My little group ordered a carmines special split with a meat lovers. I was sad we couldn't do the white pizza with the carmines special, but we were told you couldn't mix red and white. Either way, the pizza was delicious! 

If we're ever back on this side of town, I know we're gonna be able to stop in for some good eats. Maybe next time I'll have some room for some dessert."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Staff is always friendly. We usually order for delivery from them for work and food arrives fresh and yummy.  Love the $1 slice pizza. Sit in only. And their garlic knots are so yummy."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and it was delish.

Cheese Pizza- perfect crust, chewy and crisp, not too much cheese
baked Ziti-  Really good
Garlic Knots- Uh-mazing!

Adding this one to our delivery rotation."}
{"text":"Authentic NY pizza that's for sure!!! Glad to have Carmine's in the neighborhood. Lunch special 1.00 for slice can't beat that! 

Will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"I am recommending this great place! My friends and I agree that Carmine's is our fav pizza/hot wings place to go. Great service, food, and the owners were very kind! Great for families, friends, and take out too. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza place stuck in the middle of the city of sin... I've lived in Vegas since 92 and this is just my opinion between the staff ,pizza , pastas salads , and don't forget those garlic knots (with a side of Alfredo sauce for dipping) this place is one of the best vegas has to offer ! Even if they say 45 mins for delivery they always get to my house faster. So if you are looking for old school down home Italian pizza , well this is it! Also the delivery team rocks friendly and fast ."}
{"text":"Took the boyfriend there for lunch' sat down read the menu, the man said he'd be right with us. Then we waited and some others sat down, and then I noticed they had drinks and we weren't served. The guy helped everyone in the room but us. Three other guys behind the counter and no one helped us. I can only assume it's because we are gay. So we got up and left."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in Las Vegas! Service is A+ as well! Definitely would recommend this to anyone looking for some delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"This the best pizza in Vegas hands down the staff is awesome and the pizza is killer just perfect to be exact"}
{"text":"Absolutely the most amazing food! Staff is fantastic - so much better than when it was villa pizza."}
{"text":"Great piece of pizza we get the Carmines special small individual size but it was large enough for two of us for an evening snack after our Sunday night church service. The thin crust was one of the tastiest we've ever had. We weren't sure if they could fix one before they close at 9 o'clock but it was 8:15 and in less than 10 minutes we had a fantastic pizza. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"I first had Carmine's pizza over 40 years ago( then Villa pizza) still the same, missed this pizza for years! A must try"}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and now it is our favorite pizza!  My boys love the cheese pizza. The place is absolutely spotless!  Employees are friendly and it's out of way to get there, but worth the trip."}
{"text":"The person who took my order was super friendly and the delivery was fairly fast for a Saturday night.  We got a cheese pizza, which my little kids loved, but I found a little lacking in flavor.  The menu does not specify the number of wings in an order, but I was still a little bummed when I only got 7 for $8.  Most places give you at least 8, if not 10.  The teriyaki wings were really good, but I am still kind of hungry.  All in all, an okay experience, but I don't know how quickly we will be returning."}
{"text":"The food is great but let's talk about those cosmopolitans!! Omg literally can't get enough! I'm worried they've turned me into an alcoholic lol I can't get enough!! Also, the fried calamari is honestly the best in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times, now. First opted to try it out because, quite frankly, the nearest non-chain pizza joint to us bordered on cheap and tasteless with rude service. 

Carmine's is the opposite. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The pizza prices are a tad bit pricier than some places, but it's a great NY style pizza. 

It's a flavorful sauce - I prefer a bit spicier, but this was very tasty and it wasn't sweet, which I hate. Just a nice balance to the sauce. I've had a few different toppings which were all good (haven't had the sausage yet). Good cheese, good melt, they didn't go light on it as some places tend to do. I prefer a thicker crust, but this one is pretty good. I did get a Sicilian style pizza which is a little thicker (far from a deep dish, though). I loved that pizza too (I like a firmer pizza as opposed to NY thin). 

Have tried a couple of sandwiches - meatball and chicken parm. Loved them. To the last bite. Meatballs are very soft and the breaded chicken cutlet was nice and tender. Garlic knots are very good too. 

It's definitely one of the top 2 or 3 pizza places in my vicinity (I enjoy Rosati's too)."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas. Cozy family dining or take out - we eat here every chance we get. Great staff. Great management. They love you like family."}
{"text":"this place is going downhill and fast.. delivery service sucks. period. today I was quoted 10 minutes and it's been over 40 and I am less then a mile away. the last time I ordered delivery, I waited over an hour for my order only to call and find out I was out of their delivery area.. (obviously when I lived somewhere else) the fact that I had to call, only to find out that they wouldn't deliver to me.. I was livid. get it together cause ur losing business.

oh and my order was wrong. correct on the ticket but not in the box. nice.

fun fact : I praised this place over a year ago."}
{"text":"I have been eating this family's pizza since my days at Valley High School back in 80's when I would ditch classes for a long lunch.  Best tasting pizza in town. I love this place.  The cheese pizza is a standard in our place and the pepperoni sausage and mushroom is a classic.  Not a bad choice on the menu."}
{"text":"First time here and loved it. Great service and food. Finally found pizza that I truly enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! Stopped by in hopes of getting a slice (they are $1) but were told they stop serving slices at 4pm. The cashier suggested we split a personal cheese pizza. We ended up ordering the pizza, garlic fries and 2 drinks. The total for everything $20 and the pizza enough to split with one person. The fries were good but could use some salt. They serve wine/beer here too. We got our food to go but next time will try dining in!"}
{"text":"Russo's Pizza Kitchen!   Just recently they replaced their signage out front as Russo bought the place out.   Everything is still the same though!  I love the employees here.  It's got this small family feel that remembers who you are and genuinly want to take care of your pizza needs. 

I've come in here on a bad day not wanting to cook and he gave me half off the pizza just to brighten my day and cause i'm such a regular and have brought them business before.  The only thing i think they could do better is get all their stuff together as far as web address and online advertisement but often when i come in here their store is pretty full now.  So i'm REALLY happy to hear they're geting a steady flow of business. Anyway The pizza's great as everyones said and the i've had some pasta of theirs as well.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Their $1 pizza slices are a great lunch deal- unfortunately, after 4:30PM they stop selling by the slices, which is a personal pet peeve of mine. I am frequently a solo diner and ordering an entire pizza is a bit ridiculous, and if you offer slices as an option at all I see no reason to limit it to lunch (even if there is a price difference after a certain time).

Regardless, I came back to take advantage. The crust is light, thin, and crispy, and the sauce flavor is nicely balanced. I did feel it was a bit lighter on the cheese than I would have preferred. Shakers of pepper and parm are available on each table and helped perk up the pie. 

Atmosphere/decor is all red brick and red-checkered table cloths with photos of NY everywhere, which I dig. Outdoor seating is available, as are beer and wine. Good neighborhood spot, quick service."}
{"text":"It's 742 at night and they will not accept my order for delivery. Ally told me they're too busy. Not the way you want to do business but I guess if you're too busy you don't need any extra business."}
{"text":"Good pizza but very pricey for what it is. We do love it but a pizza joint shouldn't be so much money."}
{"text":"$1 slices of cheese pizza till 4 p.m.! It's really good NY style pizza, can't be beat. I have yet to try some of their other food, but I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and spaghetti. The servers are customer oriented. Good value for your take out Italian meals. Thank you."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in town.  Carmine's offers great tasting pizza.  I haven't sampled the entire menu yet, because I still can't get enough cheese pizza.  Service is pretty reliable; I've never had a bad experience here.  Everyone is always friendly, including the owner Carmine.

Prices are good, nothing super expensive.  Check out their $1 a pizza slice that they offer every day (I believe from 11-4pm).  It's only inside, and I think toppings are extra, but not that much more.  It's still a great deal.

Place is decent sized, but never too loud or cluttered.  Plus, they offer covered patio seating.

Being an East Coast guy, I still haven't found a true NY Pizza place out here that tastes as authentic as the kind you'd get from a place in NY or NJ, but Carmine's is pretty close."}
{"text":"Carmine has always been one of the great italian restaurateurs in the Las Vegas Valley. This location is small, but the food is generally very good. The pizza is about as good as you will ever find in Las Vegas. This is why I give this place 3 of 5 stars. 

Why then only three stars? The dining area does not really have servers. The people from behind the counter serve you. They are concentrating on other things like the walk up counter, taking phone orders, preparing take out orders,  etc. The dining room seems to be a nuisance to the counter staff. Definitely need to hire a dedicated dining room person around the dinner hours. The people behind the counter are way too busy to work the phones, counter, and then the dining area. I don't go as often as I would like because the service is mediocre."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in here on a fluke; we wanted to eat somewhere we hadn't before and we usually tend to go for Italian anytime, anywhere. We came upon Carmine's and decided to go in.

It was kind of a mess from the start. The boss's daughter (who looked to be about 8 or 9 years old and was wearing a Justin Bieber t-shirt) got our drink orders. That struck both of us in an odd and uncomfortable way, you know, with child labor laws and all.

My friend ordered a water and it came with a lemon in it; he told them could he have a water without lemon in it and the girl just took it back, took the lemon out, and served it right back to him. Come on, we're not stupid, we can taste if there's been a lemon in the water.

The plain cheese pizza we ordered took a good 20 minutes to come out to us, and I'm not gonna lie, it was pretty \"meh\". The cheese was falling off in clumps. We only ordered the cheese pizza 'cause the prices were definitely outrageous. The 18\" pizza we got was $14. We definitely wanted toppings and all but each additional topping was $2...so cheese pizza it was.

Service was kind of slow, which is bad, considering there were only 3 other people in the restaurant.

I wouldn't exactly recommend this place to anyone; Carmine's Little Italy on the West side of town has a better atmosphere and better service (the prices are somewhat similar, however)."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Vegas. The closest to real New York Pizza I have tasted since we moved to Vegas. John your the best."}
{"text":"Not a bad choice for pizza on the SW side of town.  Please be aware...
the Stromboli with ham in it is supremely salty. 

The personal pizzas can definitely feed two!

Fries were wet...like oily wet but somewhat tasty!

Star of the night: hot wings!  Really good.

The water was also really good.  Refreshing.  Prices are a little deceiving $1.75 for each additional topping.  
Service was on point can't really complain about that.  Overall decent spot.  I'd come back but I wouldn't order the same things.  Maybe the other dishes will blow my mind!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend there and they ignored us so I can only assume it's because were gay. People that came in after us got served and we just sat there.. so we left. Very disappointing in 2018 to have to deal with this blatant bigotry."}
{"text":"Visited NYC for the very first time and I've been obsessed with finding a pizza joint close to what I devoured in the big city. Carmine's definitely gave me that same taste and experience. The restaurant has a really nice atmosphere, it's very clean, staff was amazing and made us feel welcome. I enjoyed everything from the quality of my pizza pie, the new york vibe, the friendly staff, and especially their homemade ranch!! Must try it even if you don't eat your pizza with ranch, I recommend just ordering it. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Just opened across from Southern Hills Hospital.  The place very clean and quaint.  Your typical menu, Stromboli, Calzones, Pizza and Pastas.  Typical yes but delicious, the Pasta Fagioli was outstanding.  I had a personal pepperoni pizza, thin crust great sauce.  Go you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"First let me preface this... the food here is awesome. My review is about CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!! I wanted a $5 kids meal because that's just enough for me to eat. 4 wings and some fries. Not to mention they taste good. However I wasn't able to. They would allow it. (I've gotten the same order to go before) They wanted me to spend $8 for wings (which I knew I couldn't finish) and $5 for fries (wouldn't eat all of those either). Waste not want not.... I decided to get a $1 slice of pizza. I know my decision will not make a break them but their decision turned a $5 sell into a $1. No $5 ain't much but in this economy turning down any money isn't a good look."}
{"text":"This is a $15 \"New York\" calzone?   9\" by 6\"?  You're kidding. 

You just lost a (former) loyal customer."}
{"text":"Yikes and meh are the two words that come to mind when thinking about this place. I know that might not make much sense, allow me to elaborate. 

I'll start with meh. The taste. Very meh. The pizza was a bit bland. We only ordered a cheese and pepperoni as it was costly to get it piled with ingredients otherwise. Besides, we were trying this place out and needed to know if they can get the basics right first. It wasn't bad, but not fantastic either. Nothing I would return for. 

The dining area was average. I liked The vineyard look to it. It was a little odd how it appeared half \"date worthy \" restaurant and half sports bar if you catch my drift. Something wasn't adding up. We were almost alone. There was another patron eating a slice. Why so lonely on a weekend? Oh wait......there was one more visitor......that's where the \"yikes \" enters  this story.

ROACH!!!!!! Yes. I said it. I even screamed it while I was eating! This bug was walking up the wall right beside me just as we were finishing our food. I know, I know. Bugs are a natural part of this world and most if not all restaurants battle insect intruders constantly. However, an establishment that is kept clean shouldn't have roaches crawling up the walls next to patrons trying to enjoy an over priced bland meal! We ran out the door after that, never to return."}
{"text":"Pizza was alright, but damn the ranch is so good hahaha, I would really come and order pizza again just to dip in the ranch!!"}
{"text":"Great Food, atmosphere and clean. Fast service and greeted immediately,  I ordered the ham and cheese calzone, it came with a side of marinara, probably the best marinara I've had! To my surprise they were the originators of Villa Pizza, I loved that place since I was a teenager, I'm super glad they are still around and use the freshest ingredients and I can't say enough about their cheese! Omg absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Okay ... So I was slightly thrilled when I found their delivery menu jammed into my door. Oh boy! Another restaurant that will bring food and beverages to my little dwelling, sparing me the annoyance of cooking. Well, I had the opportunity to try them out last night. 

... Meh. 

I gave them one star for the lovely Veronica who answered the phone, spoke perfect ENGLISH, and took my order with friendly efficiency. That was truly a delightful surprise! 

The second star is for the very FAST DELIVERY time ... Under 30 minutes, despite the fact that the driver had trouble finding me. 

The lack of any other stars reflects on the wildly overpriced lasagna ($14), which arrived barely luke warm and with no accompaniments other than 2 short, doughy, greasy bread-sticks. No salad, no soup ... nuthin'. REALLY? $14 for a single serving of bland pasta filled with meat and a little cheese and hardly any sauce?! 

What really annoyed me, was that I had to actually heat the lasagna in a 350 degrees oven for 1/2 hour to get it to a point where it was slightly hot around the edges, but still only warm in the center. Grrrr .... Turning on the oven pretty much negates any benefit of getting food delivered, so I was NOT PLEASED. I felt like I did half their work for them. It was as if they had thawed out a pan of frozen lasagna, stuck it under a heat lamp and waited for the orders to pour in. FYI guys ... Pouring 1/2 cup of hot marinara on a 5-inch slab of room temp lasagna will NOT heat it through. 

Lesson learned: When ordering from a place with \"pizza\" in their name, stick to the pizza!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate at Carmine's last evening and   enjoyed ourselves so much, we dined again this evening!  The food was excellent.  I had the Hawaiian  pizza.  Crust was crispy and tasted really good.  Tonight I tried the special and loved the freshness of the veggies!   My daughter had the spaghetti.  The portion was huge!  The sauce was fabulous!   I kept sneaking bites!  And the bread is to die for.  I'm a breadaholic and this was one loaf I couldn't pass up.  The service was excellent!  Our waitress Audra was friendly and gave great suggestions.  She checked on us regularly.  The other staff was friendly as well and
 told us it was nice to see us again.  The place was spotless and the staff was cleaning up regularly.  I would HIGHLY recommend you try Carmine's!"}
{"text":"I've been eating this pizza since high school! It is always so yummy!!! Never disappointed here!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is just like old school villa here in lv. Apparently it's same guy, part of the fam. Service is hit n miss but overall decent. Forgot a wing order one time but discounted our ticket. Had the... Brooklyn sub I think it's called, didn't care for the prosciutto in it thought it was carved WAY too thick super chewy, bread was hard just a poor sub but thankfully pizza is consistent!"}
{"text":"A must to visit when in Henderson. My fiancée brought me here and I immediately fell in love with the decor. It's a family owned business, therefore the service is excellent. They treat you like a family. The food was amazing. I told them I was visiting from Cali and they made me this dessert called zeppoli. It's my first time having it and I'm craving it constantly. If you want to experience friendly eatery with delicious Italian food, Carmine's is a place to be."}
{"text":"Been looking for good, authentic Italian since arriving in Vegas and who would've thought, we found it in a strip mall on the way to a water park! This little gem is off of the charts good with its New York pizzeria ambience. We had an Antipasto Salad that came with eggplant, zucchini, kalamata olives and all the fixings. We munched on garlic parm fries and split a pizza roll...again, we didn't expect much. By the end, we were so taken by the quality ingredients and old world feel in the food that we were definitely decided on coming back to dive into their full menu of amazing pasta selections. The pepperoni roll came with a cup of gravy and it was excellent marinara! This place is worth a look if you're looking for good italiano!"}
{"text":"While at the St Rose Hospital, a nurse had recommended Carmine's on Horizon Ridge Pkwy. She said she was a regular, and raved about it. So we went and tried it a couple days later.
It was awesome! Casual, and family friendly. We went inside and found an open table. We were welcomed immediately by Gram. Outgoing and personality plus he was. Tvs had sports on, and music playing too. There are tables outside too if you want
Gram's recommendation of the mozzarella fritta was very good. Our group ordered a Carmine's special pizza and a few frosty cold Stella's. Oh and somebody at the table and she had to have dessert (a cannoli).   It was very good too.
Well I've been here twice now, both times found the place a great place for pizza and beers."}
{"text":"$1 slice special is very misleading.  Theres a weird limit of 2 per person.  They charge 75 cents for the BOX.  Gtfoh...  Thats like going to McDonalds and them charging you for the Togo bag.  I get it you want to get people in the door so you offer a special.  But then dont make your guests feel bad for ordering it.  Personally i wouldnt pay more than a buck a slice for their mediocre pizza.  So many better options in the area."}
{"text":"We prefer smaller establishments and Carmine's is a gem. We have done both take-out & dine-in. As the place is small, done-in can be iffy but worth the wait. We have tried different pizza and salad option and have yet to find a flaw. My personal favorite is the White Pizza Primavera and it is beyond delicious. The Personal size is perfect for one (I usually still have a slice or two left over for a quick snack). Staff is quick, friendly and very attentive.  Lots of return business which is always a good sign."}
{"text":"The best sausage, onion and pepper hero in town.  Yay and they call it a hero too....Made me feel like I was back in NY.  
Friendly staff!
Next, I am doing pizza...Looked delicious.
Thanks for bringing a little taste of NY on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Hands down Best Pizza in Vegas!! I recommend the pizza, chicken wings, soup and a Stella! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A friend recommended their $1 slices in the afternoon. He also said, \"It's as genuine NY City style pizza as you can get in the Valley.\"

So I went and tried a $1 slice.  It was good.

Settebello is still our favorite, but for our everyday family Friday night, it is now an Extra Large, 1/2 Mushroom, well-done from Carmine's.

It really is as close as you can get to a New York City pizza.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at Carmines for dinner with my wife.  The decor of the restaurant is nice and clean. We ordered the Carmines special and a Cesar salad. Im no pizza aficionado but this pizza was as good as any I've had, the crust was great and so were the toppings. The Cesar salad was good as well. The owner of the restaurant was warm, kind and welcoming making conversation with the customers as they finished there meals. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"When we first moved to Vegas from Chicago, we came to Carmine's and met the owners son. Pizza was good, pasta was good, they even had a decent Italian Sub. Well as it goes, the son told us he was going to opening up his own joint. We have not been here in a while, the son did go get his own place, and now the food here has no flavor at all. Salad was all wilted like it was in a fridge for a while then I had chicken parmigiana, chicken was so so, but whatever they want to call the red stuff on top, it's not gravy or marinara sauce. Tasted like it was straight out of a tin can and warmed up. 
I ordered pizza for the kids, same lame sauce on that, and the cheese was cheap and greasy. 
It's a shame, really liked this place for the past 2 years, but we will not be back."}
{"text":"I was glad to see this new pizza place open just a few minutes from my house.   They had a special for their opening day for $5.99 large pizza.   I figured you can't beat that so I would give it a try.  The staff was very nice and friendly.   The atmosphere of the restaurant was very inviting and warm.   Solid family environment with at least one fairly large flat screen tv on the well.  
But most importantly, I'll give my review of the pizza.   I got a large pie with meatballs.   It was actually a beautiful looking pie.   Looked like the kind of pizza you can eat all day every day (assuming you didn't care about getting fat or an early death).  Unfortunately, the pizza was more appealing to my eyes than it was to my taste buds.  The crust was solid but honestly it was just bland.  I think the culprit was the sauce.  Just not very flavorful.   
I'd think about stopping in for the dollar slices they offer from 11-4, but probably not.  I just didn't like the pizza much.   Didn't have much flavor.   And the meatballs I added as the topping was pretty flavorless as well.  I know all people have different preferences in pizza, but Carmine's did not hit the spot for me.  Wish you guys the best with your restaurant but I'm not  sold on making this a place I would regularly come for pizza."}
{"text":"Felt like an absolute taste of home. First time I've had cheese ravioli in this town and felt like I was in little Italy."}
{"text":"LOVE this little pizza place! It takes a lot for me to find a really good pizza that I sit and daydream about... Carmine's is drool worthy! Pepperoni and olives= perfection in my book! I prefer the personal size pizza because the crust is perfect each time. But the larger sizes are equally as delicious. 
Did I mention the ranch dressing?!!! I want to guzzle a gallon (but I resist)... and you CAN actually buy some to take home! The ambiance is cozy and I love the reminiscent decor. Outdoor seating is available as well and gated for some privacy! They provide take out and delivery. Prices are also extremely reasonable for what you get! I also love that I see the same friendly faces each time I go there. Definitely nice to have consistent customer service."}
{"text":"Wow! I came here because my son was asking for pizza and this is close by our house. I was hesitant to go in but I looked at Yelp first and the reviewers photos looked great. 

Clean inside, not crazy busy - server / cashier was very attentive and nice. Seems like they get a lot of pick up and to go orders so that was a good sign for us. It's nice and cozy, the decor gives you an Italian / pizza place vibe. 

The food came out nice and hot! We ordered an XL pizza, and garlic knots. A pizza slice from XL is huge! I believe it is 8 slices but 21-22 inches long versus a large which is 16. The server was prompt on refilling drinks, and was nice. They also do take out and deliver up to certain miles from this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot.  Service was excellent.  Food was amazing.  Had the #1Stromboli and meat lovers pizza."}
{"text":"We love this place. Pizza is so so good. We have also had the wings which were delicious.  We will only order from this awesome place!"}
{"text":"We got 2 personal pizzas and wings last night.  1 Margherita and 1 Meat Lovers.  Crust was great, not too chewy and not too thick.  Sauce was definitely in need of some seasoning.  I hardly use salt on any of my food and this pizza needed it.  The cheese on my husbands Meat Lover wasn't completely melted but what can you do.  Now the wings.  They were good in size/taste and we ordered the hottest sauce they had,  which isn't hot to us by never the less tastes ok.  The weird thing was we got 7 wings in our order.  Usually you get 10 wings in an order or at the very least 8 but never ever have we gotten 7.  Maybe they portion it by weight but I mean come on, 7 wings, lol.

We are willing to give them another try knowing that this is a new business and probably still working out some kinks."}
{"text":"I've been to Carmine's several times. They are very consistent with their food. The pizza is great. I usually get the chopped salad too, which is always fresh, and tastes good. I will return."}
{"text":"These people are amazing! I remember when it used to be Villa pizza awhile back. Pizza still tastes the same, it's definitely worth the drive to order from here. They absolutely expanded. Can't wait to order from here again."}
{"text":"Wow. I haven't even dined in, but loving this place. Placed an order over the phone. The girl who answered was so sweet and had a great attitude. I wanted delivery but she advised of the wait time in delivery so we opted to pick up. She was very helpful and i am always indecisive in what to order because I want to try everything!!

Opted with rigatoni a la carmine (simple but great flavor), XL carmine special (I was very impressed and not only by the size!! Hahaha) and finished with the zeppoles.

Kinda seemed pricy for what was ordered... But worth it for the portion size and delicious flavor. And I'd like to think I have a refined palate for amazing foods. The crust for this pizza... Oh goodness... Yum.

Next time I'll dine in to get the full experience, but from what I can see... Good food and great service. And great location."}
{"text":"Family style, and its a very large family who would be served well at Carmine's.  Located in the Forum Shops at Caesars, our experience was pleasant.  Staff was courteous and attended to our needs.  Portions are huge!  I'm a big eater and I rarely leave food on the plate, but I had no choice.  Great place for a large group, and couples should share.  Enjoy, we did!"}
{"text":"Cant beat the dollar slices. only thing is you can only buy 2 and they charge tax. Not what Im use to for dollar slices. 

A nice sized pizza with a crunchy crust and the service here is also great."}
{"text":"Great little Italian restaurant. I ordered the chicken parm sandwich. Great flavor and portion. Well done. Everyone else was ordering pizza but I wanted to give the other food a try. The sandwich is just a little pricey. With no sides included, I can find a similar sandwich for less. But, it was good and no problems with protion or price. I will try pizza if I happen to be in the area again. 4 other people came in behind me and they all ordered pizza so I think that probably the signature here. Service was good and it was clean."}
{"text":"Talk about a hidden treasure!! This hole in the wall pizzeria exceeded any expectations I had coming in. First off I have to comment on the cleanliness and friendliness of the staff, very impressive first walking in. Very casual atmosphere with New York memorabilia across the walls. They offer outdoor or indoor seating.

The staff is very attentive and happy to accommodate any dietary needs. They offer a wide variety of items on their menu. Specifically they offer $1 cheese pizza slice for dairy enthusiasts!! Our table ordered a VEGAN personal pizza with mushrooms jalapenos and pineapple( note: they were sparse with their toppings and do charge per topping.), 4 cheese slices of pizza and a basket of fries.

Our drinks were refilled before they emptied. Food was made fresh, quickly and ACCURATELY! Which is very important for patrons with dietary needs. I.E.: vegans. Home made ranch was brought out to the table for the fries. All food had freshness you could taste. Very impressive that nothing tasted stale or frozen. 

Overall, this is a really cool hidden local spot to grab lunch or dinner. I recommend the pizza highly, non greasy all the way around. Outdoor seating is intimate and quaint for a date night or family dinner. Must visit!"}
{"text":"Haven't had anything besides their $1 slices of pizza, but they are very good.  Will have to try dinner at some point."}
{"text":"pretty good food. ive had their lasagna, sausage past something, and their pepperoni pizza. its always been pretty decent. i keep them in my rotation of pizza delivery. as a few other places have fallen off."}
{"text":"This place serves up the best pizza in Vegas. I like it better then girabaldis hands down. It's a large sliced pizza. The sauce is great, it's sweet but not too sweet. The dough has a great taste. If those 2 ingredients are on point your gonna have a good pizza. It reminds me of 1.00 NY pizza spots but way better. The price is very  reasonable.  Your not going to eat this pizza and be disappointed. This place is a gem. 2 thumbs up, 5 stars, and a 10 out of 10."}
{"text":"The closest to actual NY pizza you'll find anywhere in LV is going to be at a Carmine's. There are only 2 to my knowledge - 1 here and 1 in Henderson. If you haven't tried this place yet you're missing out. The pizza is phenomenal, as are the mozzarella \"boomerangs.\" Great food, and excellent customer service. You definitely get what you pay for here. A+++"}
{"text":"This is the only place that comes close to actual NY style pizza. One of the chefs here actually used to work at a place down the block from my old house in Queens! I knew on first taste (years ago at another location) that Carmine's was going to be my top choice for GOOD pizza in Vegas. I've tried almost every \"New York pizza\" place around here, and NONE can hold a candle to Carmine's. If you're lucky enough to live near this one or the one in Hendo, consider yourself lucky and GO GET SOME FOOD!! Their dishes aren't too shabby, either. This place is always clean, even though it's usually crowded. They play good music (if you can hear it  ). Everyone here knows each other. The entire night shift knows me on a first name basis because we're always getting something from Carmine's. My food should be about ready, so I'll just close with: Try Carmine's - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"We live in the North West and stumbled into Carmine's while visiting this area a few months ago. Sine then we have become regular customers. They are well worth the drive. Great food, friendly staff, and a very clean restaurant! Clearly they take pride in their faculty and food. I highly recommend Carmine's!"}
{"text":"So happy to have John and little carmines back on the west side. I used to love going to the place on South Durango, so I was dubious when I saw this place opened up on ft apache.

Is it the same carmines? If so, could it be as good? Somethings are best left in the past, retrospect makes you remember them better but Carmine's pizza is NOT one of those things. It's just as good as I remember if not better!

I haven't had the pasta yet but the pizza is typical New York style, mellenzan was good, garlic chicken was insane, chicken was moist and I found a chicken bone on it... so you know it was good chicken!

Can't wait to have an amatriciana.

I ordered a couple times (delivery) and I love the service. One time, the chef messed up my order; but I had some picky friends in that did a custom job and it was a Friday night, so I didn't hold it against em....but they credited me a free pizza next time I ordered and then Gianni called me up the next day to make sure it was good. So, that's the best service I ever got from a pizza joint, and their pizza is the best New York style pizza west of NYC."}
{"text":"Brought the kids in here for a quick slice but ended up staying for a sit down lunch. My son had two slices of pizza and I had Carmine's chicken sandwich, which had fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, tomatoes and was just pure deliciousness.  I managed to get some pizza before my son demolished it and loved it. We sat outdoors and the service was perfect. We will be back for sure, what a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab a quick slice of pizza after a doctors appointment. The place is fairly nice. We were greeted upon entering and were told to sit anywhere we wanted. A young lady (not sure what her name was) was nice enough to help us out with our order.

Our Order:
- Two slices of the Cheese pizza ($1 each)
- Kids chicken strips w/ French Fries
- One side order of Garlic Fries.

Everything was good, except it was very plain. Nothing about it blew my mind. I was expecting the garlic fries to be/look more appetizing & loaded with more garlic. Don't get me wrong though, i would still come back for their pizza!"}
{"text":"This little restaurant is a true gem! We were in the neighborhood and saw how highly it was rated on Yelp so we decided to try it. We are so happy we did! Aliana was our server and she is just wonderful. She was incredibly personable and truly cared about experience. We started with garlic knots that were scrumptious. The marinara was delicious! My daughter had the BBQ chicken pizza and is a super picky eater... she loved it! My husband and chicken fingers and fries that were delicious as well. I ordered the baked ziti and it was truly the best I've have ever had. I can't say enough great things about this place. The decor is awesome, too. Super clean restaurant with a super welcoming vibe. Don't  pass this place up! I totally wish this place was in Centennial Hills but will be happy to drive for this great place."}
{"text":"We're from back East where Pizza is New York style and it's all friggin good!!! It's been 3 years since we've had good Ny style pizza, thank you Carmine's."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I ended up at Carmine's the other day, when we scheduled to to a Paint & Party event.  The owner of Paint & Party picked the restaurant for us, and I was pleased.  We had the space that we needed to do our thing and have some privacy, and the food was pretty good.  3 of us split a large Carmine's Special Pizza, which was perfect for lunch.  We each got our fill, and it was delicious! Thin, crispy crust with just the right amount of toppings.  Service was also great!"}
{"text":"Dollar slices may I say more? Me and my man LOVE PIZZA!! And although I have only had the pizza it's pretty good! My man has eaten more items there and says good things too! But the item that has kept him and now me coming back is that pizza it's huge slices and just so fresh and omg you have to try I believe it's between 11-4 everyday $1 a slice!"}
{"text":"Dinner at this place was the highlight of my day! I was hungry for pizza and in a little corner pavilion, my best friend and I found this place. 

We got there about 45 mins before they closed but the servers still accommodated us no problem. Immediately seated us, got our drinks and took our orders as soon as we were ready. Food came out 10 mins later. The mild chicken wings were to die for! It wasn't like other wings from other places where it's super drenched in sauce that the taste of the chicken disappears. They served the chicken juicy and only lightly glazed with the mild sauce. The perfect balance. As soon as we were done with the appetizer, our personal sized pizza came out. The serving was huge that it fed both of us. NY pizza style, thin and very cheesy. Reminded me of home. Definitely recommend to try !"}
{"text":"Excellent food! I ordered the stromboli and was pleasantly surprised. Tasty, not greasy. Ate in store first, it was clean and classy. Not expensive, the staff seems like a happy family and they treat the customers that way, too. I ordered for delivery a few weeks later, same quality of food (excellent) but the delivery wasn't very speedy."}
{"text":"We wouldn't go anywhere else but Carmines! His location on Horizon Ridge isn't fancy but his food is outstanding enough that I feel like it's a dinner, or even a lunch that deserves to be dressed up for! I ve had food that's lesser quality that I have dressed for. 
   My family met Carmines family back when he was located in Commercial Center 41 years ago! My Uncle was his bookkeeper and the families would all go and eat at his restaurant and Carmine would serve anything he had available and none of us had had New York style Pizza and pasta and we loved it All!!! The hero's I remember were just incredible! Carmine and his lovely wife Annie are the true salt of the earth. So, kind and generous. I am happy to hear they will be opening a second location."}
{"text":"Decided to take a chance and order a pepperoni pizza from looking at all the great yelp reviews here. Well, the sauce was salty and bland and the whole slice taste plain. Even if I heat the slices in the cast iron pan only makes it taste just a little bit better. I'm not sure what is the hype about."}
{"text":"It's totally amazing . The food is outstanding and this is coming from a picky eater lol . The pizza is probably one of the best in Las Vegas . I say that the pizza is better then pizza huts and etc . Also the fries are salted really well. Definitely reccomend coming her ."}
{"text":"This place is great.Been there several times. Waitresses very friendly and helpful.
Food is delicious no matter what we order.
Family friendly"}
{"text":"So amazing! I'm from Brooklyn and this is as authentic as it gets! And for $1 a slice you can't beat it!!! Not to mention the staff is so friendly!! Definitely worth checking out :)"}
{"text":"We have had pizza from here several times and have always liked it but we went to the restaurant with some friends and were very disappointed in everything.  The service was poor.  They brought out our meals at different times with at least 10 minutes between each meal being brought to the table.  The Margherita pizza was horrible and barely edible. The calzone was the only good thing that any of us had.  Overall a very poor experience."}
{"text":"Open sign was lit up but door was locked. Waited in my car until some regulars came up and they opened the door for them. They served them all first and didn't offer to seat me or even bring me my drink. Pizza wasn't that great but it was a cheap price. I got the impression I wasn't welcome. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great deal from 11am-4pm. $1 slices (cheese only, I think). Spent $5 and it fed myself and my two kids. When you're a single parent, that's about as close as hitting the jackpot for me. I haven't tried their other stuff but will definitely venture out if I can't make it for the special."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! The chicken fingers are also amazing!! Best pizza in town! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This pizza is so good I had to pause eating just to tell all of you how great it is. So dope"}
{"text":"We really liked their pizza! Reasonably priced and great costumer service. We got their bbq chicken pizza and medium chicken wings and it was really yummy! Will be going again!"}
{"text":"Love the fact that they have $1 a slice pizza. It was SO good and I'm glad to know that I can get my pizza fix without having to buy a whole pizza. I got cheese w/olives and onions and it was great, good sauce. Can't put my finger on what made the sauce so good but it was a tad sweet. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had the Garlic Knots, they were under cooked and there was a peculiar odor to them, and it wasn't garlic, so much so that my son wouldn't eat one. My kids liked the pepperoni pizza and said it was good. I had the White Pizza Primavera, that was good, but nothing to rave about. I ordered extra crispy wings, & I think they thought I said extra soggy wings, because they were so gross! Buffalo Wild Wings or the former Nikki Lee's still has the best chicken wings in town as far as I'm concerned, & I'm from Buffalo!"}
{"text":"We have lived in Las Vegas for over three years, began to give up the hope of finding good pizza then we went to the Southern Hills balloon festival and right across the street was Carmine's pizza kitchen.  We started with the garlic knots that were out of this world good, then we ordered the special wings & a large pizza.  The wings were fantastic and my spouse who is not a pizza lover ended up eating three slices.  This has become our pizza place to go or sit down and enjoy the company of the owners and the workers."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza spot in the city. My go to for hangover, cheat nights, first dates. LOVE IT here!"}
{"text":"Wow, $1 pizza. Better than anything. We see them make it fresh. GREAT FOR FAMILYS!this pizaa is sooooooooooooooooooooo"}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Ordered at half time on Superbowl Sunday.  The pizza was ready within 25 minutes and tasted great!  We will definitely try them again."}
{"text":"They have Zeppole and it is to DIE for! I haven't had them in year's.... But boy did it bring back some memories and the Raspberry sauce that accompany it is my favorite! I love the dollar slices also I scoop up a couple after/before my Treatment."}
{"text":"Great family pizza spot! They have a little bit of everything italian menu. Its homemade feels. My husband and I shared a chicken parmessan sandwich and meatball sandwich, both were very good. Our kids got a perfect size pizza, and spaghetti. Im coming back."}
{"text":"I usually love this place and the pepperoni roll is amazing but I got my normal - and it was a was very greasy kind of hard to eat other than that my waiter was great and everything else was fine"}
{"text":"More like Crapmine's Pizza.  This place can suck it.  I ordered a pizza for delivery and was told it would be 20-30 minutes.  After waiting patiently for over an hour, I gave them a call and was told the driver was 2 minutes away.  20 minutes later, I called them to complain.  After my 30 second rant, the scum on the other side of the phone was like, \"I'm sorry brah, what was that?\"  Psshh.  Whatevs."}
{"text":"Really friendly service, great food and nice little cozy environment. The zeppoli's are amazing!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza! We are Chicago pizza type family, but on our way to wet n wild we noticed this place and stopped in. We were highly impressed! While sitting there we noticed lots of take our customers which made us feel good that they had a good customer base. The lasagna pizza was great but very filling. We'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Nice little neighborhood pizza spot. Not too many places in Vegas to get a decent quality New York slice but this place does just that. 1.75 per pepperoni slice and 1 dollar cheese slices, can't beat that. Good service as well."}
{"text":"Our family loves this little pizza place! You really can't beat the friendless of the staff, prices and food quality!"}
{"text":"This I my 3rd time getting food from here, 2nd time dining in and honestly it's good pizza at a great price. The girl who works the counter is really really sweet she addresses everyone as sir miss or ma'am is on top of everything she always make sure you have a full drink and belly. Thanks for the wonderful hospitality over everything!"}
{"text":"I call and a very rude lady answers the phone.... not very good customer service..... I understand that you're busy but when you answer the phone those are future customers that are wanting to frequent your place...."}
{"text":"My favorite is the X-Large Pizza!  The cheese stretches and the quality of the ingredients is impeccable.  I've tried a lot of pizzas around the area and this is my favorite!  If you like the $5 Jumbo slice pizza you get after a night of festivities, then you will definitely love this pizza joint."}
{"text":"It was just ok. Had the meatballs and a large pepperoni pizza. Food was pretty good, but the prices were steep compared to other places. Honestly, I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing 5 stars  no doubt!  Today I ordered a meatball sub for dilvery it was a 4 stars because the meatballs are soft and full of flavor.  But the bread was a little bit burnt n crispy n there wasn't enough cheese or sauce :(  so I think I will just stick to the great pizza.. The staff is very freindly and efficient. I will be back."}
{"text":"One of my clients recommended this place to me so we checked it out on a Sat afternoon. We ordered a Caesar salad and large white veggie pizza. Salad was very good and Pizza was absolutely delicious. Table next to us ordered plain cheese and my client says that's what she gets so def getting that next time. It's that great fold in half New York style pizza. The service was great and friendly. Place was busy and they did great accommodating everyone with a smile. No complaints. Fairly priced with plenty of leftovers!! Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this local neighborhood pizza spot! Carmine's Pizza Kitchen is located on the corner of Sunset & Fort Apache not too far away from my house. I've seen it plenty of times driving past and kept saying I must try them out. This weekend I put the procrastination to rest and decided to give them a shot.. So the fact that they sell pizza by the slice really sold me because there are far too many time I have a crazing for a pizza but don't want to buy a whole box. 

When I walked in, I was greeted right away by the front counter person and helped right away. Pizza by the slice? Well I kept it simple with a single slice of cheese pizza which only came to $1.87 or something. Not bad! I was expecting more but that price was great. While I waited in the dining room I noticed that they actually have a full service restaurant type of set up with a server and everything! The ambiance of the place is really cool and you get the feel of being in New York City. I took a look at the menu more in depth and noticed that they have a wide range of options so I will definitely be back. 

The to-go menu offered that cheese pizza slices were $1 with a maximum of 2 slices per person and of course I didn't notice this until after the fact so I left wondering why the person who took my order didn't tell me about this. Other than that situation the review would've been a 5-star but menu knowledge is critical and basically I could've just bought two slices if that was the case.."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Clean place. 

Visited with one of the employees while waiting for our pizza. Didn't realize how long this business had operated in Vegas. Will definitely be back. I enjoy places that gave a bit of history to them."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. extremely good :) they have pizza slicers for a dollar thats really why i come lol. All workers here are super nice.. idk their names but i haven't came across anyone with attitude. Theyre all so welcoming and while youre eating theyll create a conversation with you if theyre not busy. Great place and great food. If you live around the area or work around the area definitely come in at give them a try cause youll most likely come back with friends and family. Its a cute place that deserves to be recognized for their food and atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"Best pizza and deep fried calzones in Henderson! Great people that work there, clean, friendly!"}
{"text":"Finally got to come and eat here this evening ! Pizza was amazing , but more importantly our waitress Made our experience great ! I told my husband it's really about the service you get dining out that makes the place and meal great! I forgot the name of my pizza lol but it was delicious! White pizza , mozzarella cheese , spinach !! Thanks D ! Your great! And have awesome energy!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of our favorite places to go! My fiancé and I have been coming to Carmine's since we moved in the area and we can't stay away! They have great food and the people are so friendly! We have now become regulars so they chat with us and it makes us feel so good and comfortable! Definitely would recommend!!"}
{"text":"The pizza her is great just the  waiter are rude and racists especially the one with long hair. When I was there he didn't  feel up my drinks or asked if we needed anything else and to topic off he gave me paper plates and the woman next to regular plates and we order the same thing that's why I gave them one star"}
{"text":"On 7/26 we ordered food for delivery at about 6:30pm. We just called in directly to order and live 2.5 miles away. Placing the order was quick and friendly. We ordered fried calamari, antipasto salad, pasta fagioli soup and the sausage/pepper sandwich. The food arrived in an acceptable amount of time by a friendly driver. My antipasto salad was very good although I prefer any other type of lettuce to iceberg which was the only lettuce it had. I'm sure I could have asked before hand and asked them to use romaine or mixed greens, so my bad. It had a delicious big chunk of mozzarella on it with salt/pepper and balsamic. It also had other delicious toppings as described on the menu. The calamari was good. It had whole tiny octopus if you are into that (which my family was). My husband enjoyed the sausage/pepper sandwich a lot. The pasta falgoli soup was good. It was a bland tan color with pretty much just beans and pasta, more beans than pasta which I liked. I believe they were white beans. The flavor was simple and comfortingly good. Very filling. I only got the cup size but the soup alone could have been a meal. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the ranch dressing but this really boils down to personal preference. It certainly wasn't bad but I prefer a little thicker consistency and a different taste which I can't describe. You'll just have to try it. Anyway, yeah, we would order from Carmine's again."}
{"text":"Pizza is not that great.  So many better choices in the neighborhood.  Service is lacking.  Not very attentive wait staff.  The worst part about dining in is the manager constantly screaming at the staff behind the counter.  The jersey shore dropout definitely has a complex.  It's entertaining at first but then you start to feel bad for the staff.  Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Think I found my new fav pizzeria. I got a large cheese and a sausage and pepperoni pie. The crust was amazingly crisp and passed the NYC fold test!! Probably the best pizza I had outside of my in-laws resturants in NYC. On the side we had an order of the hot wings. Cooked up crispy without any breading, so if your lowcarbing and your significant other wants pizza, bam just get the wings and your in business."}
{"text":"True NY pizza, I don't know how they recreate it here but I'll definitely be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"The pizza at Carmines is absolutely delicious! If you are from the northeast you will really appreciate it even more. Their pasta fagioli soup is excellent as well as their spaghetti sauce. When calling to place an order the employees are always very pleasant as well as when we pick up our order."}
{"text":"Ok pizza, just not memorable. If convenient we would order again, but more than likely, we won't. Other places within a few miles are much better"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere ! The pepperoni pizza was great! Love the New York decor! Huge slices ! Would go again!"}
{"text":"Carry out pizza and we were really impressed by the friendly demeanor we were welcomed with. Pizza was really decent and filling. Fed a family of 4 for less than $25. It was a win-win. Next time, hope to dine in!"}
{"text":"I walked in here on a whim when I stopped at the dollar store. Was greeted right away and placed my order. The linguine a la bolognese is AMAZING. So much flavor and the noodles were perfectly al dente! The bread it comes with is delicious as well dipped into the bolognese sauce. Definitely coming back here! Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Meh... I'm still looking for a bomb pizza place. We got a pizza with three cheeses , pepperoni, and sausage. It tastes like most of the pizza places out there. I'm still on the hunt for flavor"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes!!!!
Finally...just what we needed on this side of town! 
I came here in opening day but only had pizza! Last night family dinner 8 people and 3 large pies and 2 salads and spaghetti and meatballs and pepperoni rolls and Stromboli and wine!!! Did I say yes??!! Do yourself a favor and get down to Carmine's!!! Congrats Vento family it's amazing as usual!!"}
{"text":"The Pizza tasted fair it wasn't great almost bland. Since the XL was super huge and they only cut into eight slices, I asked if they could double slice since it was offered, to my surprise when I got home I had 8 big slices... no biggy though but if it's being offered at least do it.
 
Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Pizza is always solid here. I go for lunch and get the slices. Cheap lunch but quality is not sacrificed. Go get a slice and you'll know what I mean. NY pizza at it's best."}
{"text":"2 for 2. Second time ordering from here and second time orders were mixed up and the pizza crust was burnt."}
{"text":"2 words : margherita pizza! Also, the Linguine Bolognese is to die for! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Came here over the weekend with the family. AMAZING service. Super friendly and helpful. Small atmosphere was very comfortable. The food was DELICIOUS. The Garlic knots... OH My!! definately coming back as a regular spot to eat out!"}
{"text":"We are among the OG's who used to eat here when it was Villa Pizza. The kids and my childlike brother always loved the sweet tangy sauce. ( In later years, my brother made a discovery of empty cans of Campbell's tomato soup in their trash. Coincidentally, this was always my mother's \"secret ingredient\" in spaghetti sauce. My mother was not even one smidge Italian. She was a white girl from Idaho.)

Don't worry about what my brother was doing in their trash.

Anyway, Babygirl and I were jonesing for pizza to go with our evening of the \"Walking Dead\" (eat first, view later!), and she decided it had to be the glorious pie of her childhood memories. 

 We picked up so I can't comment on the delivery, but all went well with our order. A large cheese is about $14, which isn't too bad. The pizza did taste pretty much the same as before, which is 4 stars from her and 3 from me. The thin crust is nice and chewy and had a decent char. The chicken wings were nice and meaty but a little tough, but they do have great ranch dip- nice and garlicky. They were at a steady 3 stars until we tried the meatball sub.

 Yuck! Meatballs should be moist and tender- these went past that and deep into mushy. Tasted like more filler than meat. I think they used that recipe from the poor relative's barbeque in \"National Lampoon's Vacation\".  Gave most of it to the very surprised dog, who never gets anything. 
He ate it, but last night he was eating a rat, so I wouldn't depend on his opinion."}
{"text":"Very good spaghetti and meatballs. Love the sauce. Service was right on. Had plenty leftover for the next day. First timer but definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Chopped salad and the special pizza with Jalapeños. 
Friendly staff. 
Food amazing. 
Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"A#1 Customer Service! Our server tonight was Ally, a 17 year old senior in high school. But you would never guess that because of how mature and engaging she was.  If I could have, I would have also tipped her in pokeballs as she hasn't had time in the past few days to collect any since she's been so busy this summer. 

We got to the restaurant a little after 6pm and the restaurant was empty. So I was a little afraid that we made a bad choice. However, a few minutes later, a family of 5 came in and the patriarchs were Italian. Apparently, this family was a regular to the restaurant. My husband and I enjoyed eaves dropping on their conversation about where their fathers worked in NY. And few minutes after that, two young couples also dined-in. 

Food was excellent. We ordered calamari for appetizers, my husband ordered the chicken Parmesan with linguini, while I ordered the eggplant Parmesan with spaghetti. 

The size of the chicken Parmesan was more than half the size of the plate. And the thickness of the chicken was about 1/2 an inch. For both dishes, there was plenty of marinara sauce that I needed to use the dinner roll to sop up the sauce to ensure it wouldn't spill over into my dress. 

Although we didn't have pizza, my husband did ask about the $1/slice pizza. It is a $1 cheese pizza. If you, it is $.75 for each topping. 

We loved the decor of the restaurant. My husband  commented on the amount of pictures they had as it filled up every wall space. The restaurant and restroom was very clean. Outdoor dining is also available but never a choice of mine during the summer. 

Carmine's, my new favorite neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"The pizza is sub-par at best. Garlic bread was okay, but they use garlic powder instead of garlic. And, for a Saturday at 7 pm, it was dead!"}
{"text":"Great food and flavor in the pasta. The pizza is always delicious no complaints. We order the original cheese pie and never disappoints. The pasta portions are very generous And flavorful always pleased with the food and service"}
{"text":"Simply amazing!!!  Try everything on the menu, it's worth the time.  The alfredo is second to none!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food and service! Plus you can't beat the view of the \"bitches\" next door.....(relax, it's a joke-there's a vet next door, lol)"}
{"text":"I called in and ordered six slices of pizza I got there after driving 25 minutes and they tell me oh the lady before you said she ordered those six slices of pizza, we have four left.. not once did they apologize or even explain what happened and ended up charging me full price. I thought at least I would get a discount or something for the inconvenience but not even a \"sorry\" the owner Is a jerk and always grumpy and horrible customer service when I go in there to eat or pick up. done with it.. I miss Frankie and john."}
{"text":"This is a perfect local spot for real traditional pizza. The sauce and quality ingredients are what set this place apart. I'm only regretting I hadn't found it earlier. The prices are great. The place is a little small but it's cozy. The service was really spot on. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Always really great and solid food. One of my favorite spots with friends. Especially during dollar slice (11-4) which is a great price for hungry teenage mouths."}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall pizza place. Live atmosphere, awesome decor & service was great. Homemade ranch dressing was delicious! I wasn't a huge fan of the garlic fries or the pizza. It wasn't bad & I'll have it again sometime but isn't my first choice. Menu has a wide variety of items so I'd like to try different things out."}
{"text":"I've driven by Carmine's a thousand times and finally decided to try it out. I called to get some pizza delivered the other night. We got a 10\" cheese pizza and a 10\" vegetarian (mushrooms, peppers, black olives, tomatoes and onions). They have a third party deliver the pizza so you have to pay that person separately -- $2 plus tip. It didn't take long for the pizza to arrive and surprisingly it wasn't soggy at all. The crust was thin and crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. Both pizzas were very good. The veggies looked fresh and based on the varying sizes of the tomato slices I'm guessing they use fresh ingredients. The pizza could have used more mushrooms, but overall it was delicious. It was a little pricey -- over $20 for two small pizzas -- but the quality was very good."}
{"text":"The first time I came to Carmine's I was captured by the $1 pizza sign. I expected an alright slice of pizza much to my delight the pizza was amazing! It's a thin crust and the home made ranch compliments it very nicely. Since my first visit about a month ago I've been here about 6 or 7 times week for the $1 pizza and other delicious menu options such as the Philly Cheesesteak and the pepperoni rolls!!! It's all so delicious and it's not greasy gross cheesy goodness which is a huge selling point for me."}
{"text":"Gotta give it a 4 since the pizza is pretty good, not the best, but the best you will find on East Sahara.  

I have never dined in, and probably never will because the place always seems a little dead and the waitress/cashier/hostess/manger person is always having a spat with the cook.  I have picked up from here many times, there is always a different person running the show are that individual has never been very personable.

They do not deliver, so dine-in and carry-out are your only options.  Definitely call ahead and time your drive to arrive at the restaurant after your pizza is ready. Get your pizza and get out! That is my advice.

The pizza has been consistently good.  You won't be disappointed with the pie."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their pizza is like something from a mom and pop shop in Manhattan and their fried ravioli was excellent. I can't wait to try their mozzarella sticks. Moderately or cheaply priced, depending on whether you're there during their $1-cheese-pizza-slice special going on, Carmine's is located not too far off the freeway and close to the District."}
{"text":"This place is amazing especially for the lunch dollar slices. This is pretty much real pizza and not like your make shift Pizza Hut or Dominos Pizza. Sounds like those complainers wants free food like always. Shame on them."}
{"text":"Spotted this place earlier when I grabbed a sandwich next door. Decided to check it out for a take out order later that evening. 

I'm guessing it's a seat yourself type of place because no one greeted me when I got there and that's what I did. And then I sat at a table for 10 minutes and not a single person working there acknowledged my presence. 

In that time they set up two tables for two  parties , one of whom appeared to arrive after me (I can only assume that perhaps they called ahead) and finally after seeing a guy pick up an order from the counter I got up and placed an order with a waitress who walked by me sitting in the front three times and never even as much said \"Hi!\" Or \"I will be with you in a few minutes.\"  And I will add the restaurant was not full either. 

The same with one other waitress who was placing water on a table next to me. I will be blunt, I was  about to leave and never come back. But hunger won out. 

So, they won't be getting any points based on customer service. At all. And that's sad because I prefer local spots to a large chain pizza place any day of the week. 

This review is completely based on the pizza which for a personal size seemed a bit pricey, but had the service been better I can admit that might not have stood out to me. 

After finally seeing the size of the personal pizza, the price bothered me less. It was about the size of a small in many restaurants and not the mini size I was expecting. 

The verdict: nice fresh ingredients, chewy thin crust but otherwise unremarkable in taste. Sauce was a bit bland. I could see myself partaking of the $1 slice, but not sure I would order a whole pie again or bring visiting friends here."}
{"text":"It's hard to find great pizza in town! This place is fantastic! I love NY style pizza but there just was never a place close enough to my home until I discovered Carmines. I've been here 3 times now with a group of friends!"}
{"text":"Best slices around for $1. Thats from 11-4.. Whole pizza's are the best. They have only my favorite beer on tap \" STELLA\". Sausage & pepper sandwich is the best I can find. The meatball's are just like grandma's. Sicilian food awesomeness..."}
{"text":"Tried again, ordered 2 topping  pizza, veggies (onions) were not cooked very well, close to raw.  Place was so hot, asked if air was out and told no, just doesn't  work well.  People walked in turned around and left because it was too hot.  I may wait till after summer to try again."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS SPOT!!! This place is the perfect spot to go and meet up with friends, relax, and enjoy some fantastic pizza, pasta, and the greatest wings I personally have had in a while. I would recommend Carmine's even to someone who doesn't like pizza, because that isn't just their main focus. Also, the setup is very stylish and is a good place to sit and eat at, instead of just taking your food. I would give a 7/5 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I don't think anyone should pay over $15 for a personal Margarite pizza. I called in my order and had to wait over a half hour on a not so busy night."}
{"text":"I just want start by saying, I've eaten here before(take out) and this was not what I expected going in there this time. 
We sit down, we don't get acknowledged for about 10 mins, finally when we do, not the most welcoming server. No apologies for the wait, no smile, nothing. She says \"Are you ready to order?\".... 
We order our food- she brings the food, we say  \"Thank you\" 3 TIMES,  no response. She just drops the food off and walks away. She comes back to ask if my wife wants a box, but doesn't ask me... IDK why... 
So overall the food was ok, but was just treated very poorly. Probably wouldn't return to eat here again."}
{"text":"Delicious thin crust pizza... the plain cheese is a family favorite. Great service, everyone is always friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Found this gem of a place driving by.  First time we decided to stop in one day with my little one to try the $1 pizza by the slice.  We were not disappointed!  Fresh NY style thin crust pizza, so so yummy!  Slices are huge!  A week later we ordered to go.  Spaghetti with meatballs, a calzone and cheese pizzas.  Once again super yummy large portions!  We will definitely be back to dine in as they have such cute original decor inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! We order from you guys every week however you guys need to step it up on the meat. Got lost in the bun"}
{"text":"Two words:  MELENSANA PIZZA.  This pizza is hands down my favorite anywhere.  All of their pizzas, salads and other dishes are spot on.  I am Italian and am extremely picky with Italian food.  Everything here is just like Nonna made it!  Definitely check this place out.  If you like eggplant parm, you must try the melensana pizza."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant. I've lived in Vegas 20+yrs, and used to frequent the Villa Pizza in Green Valley back in the 90's. If they've changed at all, it's for the better (which is hard to do). The pizza is great, but the PASTA?....you can't get any better for the price! They used to have a really nice sports bar/ dining establishment on S. Durango, and I wasn't sure this humble looking new place would \"measure up\" to the outstanding food they served there....my worries withered away when I ordered the lasagna, my long-time favorite, and for the first time, rigatoni al la carmine. Now the only trouble I have is deciding which to order!!! 
From the flavor of the dishes, to the portion sizes, to the price, you can't beat Carmine's for neighborhood Italian food.

Note: the bad reviews on here prompted me to right a review (my 1st). Those reviews really seem unreasonably harsh and unforgiving. Even if I received \"less than perfect\" service, I'd try and remember no one is 100% ALL the time! Also these guys have \"hit the mark\" every time I visited, so....give them a shot, you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"We went back to Carmine's last night and ate inside. We had garlic knots which were to die for, an x-large pizza which I still believe is the best pizza in the Las Vegas area, a bucket if wings that were cooked to perfection (medium heat on the sauce) and cannoli's for dessert that were very tasty. I can't wait to go back. The food is  consistently good"}
{"text":"i eat here pretty frequently. it's authentic and has a nice atmosphere. they also have fast delivery and doesn't taste like cheap pizza."}
{"text":"Long wait and overpriced philly. It was all bread and the house salad was also over priced. Never it here again. Big rip off."}
{"text":"Good food. I'm from New Jersey, pretty hard to find decent Italian food. Not Jersey, but good enough to return."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza and pasta place in the city.. John is very friendly and the staff is wonderful I visit on a weekly basis!! My family likes going to carmines"}
{"text":"yes, carmines is sort of back. food and pizza still the best in henderson. gone is the shrimp on a stone and the bar and the restuarant. just a 6 table bistro now. nicely done but i miss instant replay and 24 hr availibility. thats why i marked it down a star.
BTW they also now have different sizes of pie not just the individual."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night and it was delicious! We all had personal size pizzas which were enough for two people. The flavor was good and the toppings were fresh. The wait staff was fast and we never had to ask for a refill. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Only thing better than the food is the friendly service!

Great Italian style comfort food.  Rigatoni ala Carmines is a incredible pasta dish.  And as a NYer I am comfortable telling you all they make the best calzone in Vegas"}
{"text":"Service good I had the carmines chicken sandwich garlic bread. Both were great. I eaten here before and never had an issue. This is my favorite place"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST PIZZA in town ! I'm here 2-3 times a week ! The staff here is super friendly and make you feel at home. I highly recommend you get down here and have a slice or 2 or 3 or 4... you won't regret it !"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Great fresh ingredients. Never disappointed when we eat here. Best we have found in vegas in the last year that we have bern here."}
{"text":"Ordered Pepperoni Pizza, crispy wings for fight night Saturday. I palced the order over the phone and I know I am not spelling the name correctly but it's pronounced Dunia took my order and was one of the friendliest people I have had help me ordering food in a long time, give her a raise! HAHA. Of course the pizza was excellent and the crispy wings(hot) were gone in 5 minutes. Also their chopped salad had lots of flavor as well. Cannot wait to eat there again:)"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken parm. Pretty generic tasting, but it wasn't terrible. The cheesecake was delicious though!"}
{"text":"In my original review, I mentioned I try my best to support local businesses but I gave up on having pizza at Carmine's because we twice dined in and ordered the Carmine's Special and it was just not good - and certainly not New York style pizza, as both times, the crust was soggy and chewy. The sauce/toppings/cheese were just OK, certainly nothing special and not enough to make up for the disaster of a crust.

Fast forward to last week when some of my coworkers got takeout from Carmine's including a \"meatlovers\" pizza and offered me a slice. Simply put, I was blown away because the crust was done in traditional NY fashion - you know, that crisp yet foldable goodness. But how could this be? Especially since this was a takeout pizza, probably at least 20-30 minutes old by the time I got my hands on it - surely there was no way this could be from the same place that twice gave us a soggy pizza, dine-in no less.

I wanted to put my opinion on Carmine's to bed, so I rallied some friends and dined in at Carmine's once again - and this time, we ordered both a Carmine's Special and a \"meatlovers\" pizza. Amazingly, the \"meatlovers\" once again came out with a nicely crisp yet foldable crust, yet the special once again came out completely soggy and terrible.

It boggles my mind how two pies, made at the same time and at the same place and (presumably) by the same person could be so different. So even though I now know Carmine's is capable of making a New York style pizza, that doesn't help my opinion of them because it just means they have serious consistency and quality control issues. And while I'm hesitant to declare that the \"meatlovers\" might always be made well (because of limited sample size), if that's the case, then surely it should not be that Carmine's own namesake pizza is allowed to be consistently terrible?

So ultimately, my recommendation remains the same: if you go to Carmine's, stick to the non-pizza offerings on the menu. It's asking too much to drop $20+ on a pie given the inconsistency."}
{"text":"I guess if you pay a dollar for a slice of pizza you get a paper but every one else get a regular plate? The cashier was rude and I was not comfortable. There pizza crust was hard and slightly burned no wonder it was a dollar."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite pizza place. Great family atmosphere. They forgot to put in my order of calamari, which wasn't a big deal, but they went way to take care of our table. I think the whole staff apologized. Really friendly folks. And the food was great!! Look forward to trying the rest of the menu. Like I said my favorite neighborhood pizza place."}
{"text":"First time I ever came here and automatic bad impression. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this place if you get Allianna on the phone taking your order. Horrible phone service skills, attitude from 'hello' to 'goodbye'. Even if the pie is good, it doesn't matter cause I'm already irritated. She's gotta be either bored or too comfortable with the job because she sure sounded like it on the phone. Asked me 3 times if I knew they were on Ft. Apache, in a manner which conveyed I'm stupid and shouldn't be calling that location. I'm not happy because she straight soured my maiden experience here."}
{"text":"I am SO happy to find this place! They have the best pasta fagioli and great pasta dishes for great prices. Don't even get me started on the pizza!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  The pizza is awesome, garlic knots rock, and the waitresses are the best.  They are super friendly and already know what we like!  This is only out second time here!  We remember this place being on Rainbow and I guess they are up here now.  The marinara is so good...  This might be our new local joint for pizza!!!  They have some really good lunch specials for the new year that we are definitely going to have to try...  Will be back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"Wanted this to be great. It's so close to home. It was expensive and mediocre.  The pizza had no flavor. NO flavor. It was bread with cheese. I could barely get through one piece it was so bad. The crust was hard and stale tasting. $13.99 for a large (the smallest size unless you get personal), plus $2.25 extra per topping. They skimped on toppings. Not impressive in any way. We also got the mozzarella fritta, which was ok, but again, expensive. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"My family and I came in for the grand opening night. There was a great $6 special for a large pie so why not?! When we came in there was one table open and one person in the take out line. 

There were several things you could order, a great selection. The staff was great, checking back with us often during our very long wait. The only exception to the wait staff was them steering us away from ordering a larger pizza due to \"wasting our money.\" Finally when the pizza came, it lacked flavor. 

You could not taste the sauce at all, just a dense crust and the topping. We came back hoping all the \"bugs\" would be worked out and for a better experience but it wasn't. 

Pros: close to home, in dining seating, tv, nice menu selection, friendly staff. 
Cons: lacking flavor in the pie."}
{"text":"We are locals here (part of the year here, part elsewhere).  We eat out every single day. We recognize that the restaurant business is a difficult and tricky business to achieve success in. We eat in divey out of the way places and in high end restaurants (Capital Grille, Delmonico's).  It is with this in mind we write reviews.

Short recap:  Good value, tasty food, small casual setting with excellent service. We are very happy we found this place.

Carmine's is a privately owned two location Italian restaurant.  It's small, very casual and comfortable.  We dropped in for the first time as they were advertising  Slice of Pizza for $1.  They have a full menu - appetizers, salads, pizza, grinders, pastas, beer, wine and desserts.

The service was great. Rachelle was the waitress and she was on the ball, friendly, engaging and informative.  We got two slices of cheese and a small salad.  The pizza is thin crispy crust and was delicious.  I added a little parmesan  and oregano but I always do.  Good value for $1.  The salad was a good size, fresh and crispy.

So we went back the next day to try more of the menu -  Ordered 2 cheese slices, garlic knots, spaghetti and meatballs and another olive oil pasta.  Huge portions which is good because, hey, it's pasta.  Good red sauce.  3 nice sized meat balls.  Nicole our waitress this day was equally attentive and Rachelle watched over us as well, bringing a bowl of extra sauce on her own. 

Everybody is a food critic and especially those who are \"from NJ or NY - and \"what - you call this Italian\" blah blah blah. Don't believe them.  This place was good. Good food, good setting. good value, good service.   We recommend this place as a terrific little casual neighborhood Italian eatery."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Friday night around 9. We were the only ones there (maybe should have been a clue) even though they were open till 10. The food was ok - had a group of 8 and we were starving so we ordered apps & salad & pizza. The lady serving us was nice but perhaps she was preoccupied. It seemed like we might have been a nuisance to the staff - maybe they were ready to close up. Nevertheless they did serve us -- we ate it all. My daughters thought it was awesome that they had really clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, the best Italian food that I've had in many many years. I felt like I was in an Italian restaurant back in Brooklyn New York. The calzone was baked to perfection overflowing with ricotta and mozzarella the cheeses, sausage and spinach. We also had the eggplant sandwich. The bread was perfectly baked, the crust crispy and light, the perfect crunch and soft interior. The eggplant was delicious. I can't eat sauce right now but I had to eat a bit of it. The sauce reminded me of my grandmother's and father's sauce, delicious! 

I look forward to our next trip back to Henderson!"}
{"text":"Much cuter inside than I expected. We had a personal pizza, the stromboli with spinach pineapple and bell pepper and the baked ziti. Everything tasted excellent and was beyond our expectations. This is our new go to easy family night place. Also the wait staff was wonderful."}
{"text":"We're trying this for the first time since it just opened recently. The service is great. They're very attentive and welcoming. I like that they sell pizza by the slice, but the prices for the whole pie are very expensive. ($19-25). The pizza is good, but a little hard and too thin. They sell you $1 slices before 4. So that's worth it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in Carmine's Pizzeria is NY good ol' days. There is vintage collage on the walls featuring famous NY landmarks and parks, famous Starlets and newspaper clippings. The tables are trimmed with red and white checkered oilcloth. The kitchen looked orderly and clean, there are couple huge pizza ovens facing the checkout counter. It appears they offer wine and beer, along with soda and iced tea for beverages. 
I only ordered an extra large cheese pizza ($17.99) and a bucket of fries ($4.99) for the kids and their friends back at home. I had one piece of the cheese pizza and it was pretty good. I took a menu home and the prices seem a little steep for some of the menu items, like an additional topping on a pizza is and extra $3.75 each? So a handful of black olives would be $3.75? Or $25.99 for a bucket of chicken fingers?  Their bucket is actually a styrofoam to-go box. However, the lunch special of a slice of cheese pizza for $1.00 sounds good as my kids rarely eat a whole pizza anyway. (Lunch special is 11-4pm , eat in only).
They seem to have a very extensive menu and I would consider returning to try the garlic knots which smelled and looked amazing. They also have quite a few varieties of salads and pasta, stromboli and calzones, hot and cold subs and even a few desserts such as homemade cannoli and tiramisu. 
The girl at the counter was very friendly and while she seemed to be the only one waiting tables and checking people out, she was accommodating and attentive. 
They have a couple outdoor tables under umbrellas and about 15-20 tables inside."}
{"text":"Pizza is good.  Deep fried calzone like at San Genaro in Little Italy.  I find it funny they copied \"Don't cook tonight, call chicken delight.\"  Only a New Yorker would get that from their saying \"Don't cook tonight, Call Carmines Delight\":)"}
{"text":"Great food. 

They had toasted raviolis big tv's and clean restrooms. Will def be back.  

Stella on tap and delicious New York style pizzas."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza and pretty good wings haven't tried much else on the menu but the baked ziti which was pretty decent as well. Pretty quick delivery and awesome customer service."}
{"text":"Finally! NY style pizza with great flavor!

Found this on Yelp while trying to locate a nearby NY style pizza place with at least decent reviews. Found a few photos of the pizza, got a good review from an actual New Yorker...and it's close to my house. Checked all of the boxes.  

Went in for a few slices of the plain cheese to go. Had a great conversation with the guy who took our order. Really outgoing. He was waiting on all of the tables as well; inside and outside of the restaurant. After a few minutes in the oven, our pizza was ready. Smelled wonderful all the way home. 

Love at first bite. THIS is the pizza we have been in search of for a while now. The crust is light and crispy. The sauce is slightly tangy with great flavor. It tastes freshly made. And there is the perfect amount of grease on the cheese. The cheese does not overwhelm the slice either. 
 Excellent service, excellent pizza, and yes we will be back."}
{"text":"I love pizza and I was excited for this place to open close to home. My husband asked me one night what I wanted for dinner and I said let's try the new pizza joint, Carmine's. They left flyers at my door (these advertisements do work sometimes) and the one thing I was really craving was a meatball sub. I told my husband to order the meatball sub and pizza to go. He did what I asked and my verdict is....

Meatball sub was alright. Meatballs were ginormous so that was awesome but it was fairly bland. The pizza on the other hand was pretty good. It's a thinner type of pizza so don't expect it to be a thick crust. I would frequent this place more often if it wasn't over 30 bucks for a pizza and a sandwich (a girl has to have leftovers to bring lunch for work the next day)."}
{"text":"It's back to basics for the original owners of Villa Pizza. This location was originally Villa Pizza- home of the New York style cheese pizza. Like my husband, I ate here many years ago, my college years- the calzones and pizza were the best things on the menu. My husband liked it so much that his bachelor party started here for dinner. Years later,  it was sold and renamed Amalfi Pizza, claiming the same ownership, which wasn't true. The pizza recipe had changed- too much of a spice in the pizza sauce. Fast forward a few years, a buyback, a complete makeover inside ( think italian vineyard), and back to the original owners. 

It was amazing inside, considering it was a sports bar before- it was a nice surprise. We had dinner there with my father in law and his wife (who know the owners, by the way). We had the cheese pizza (delicious), and a dinner salad. The cheese pizza was just as how Villa Pizza made it (the original new york style cheese pizza). Carmine and his son (who also manages the other restaurant locations as well) said Hello, which was nice. This family owned and operated (open 7 days a week) place has: appetizers, salads, pizza, calzones, pasta, hot & cold subs, pizza by the slice (cheese @ $2.25 ea), and catering is available.

Coupons were mailed out to those who live in the area. Special on Sunday, Monday, & Tuesday: Large Cheese Pizza for $9.95, 5 pm- 9 pm dine in only."}
{"text":"The wife and I enjoy Carmine's Little Italy, and we've always been fans of Villa Pizza (which was started by Carmine and his family). After driving by this place quite a few times, we thought it was time to try it. We didn't dine in, but I did pick the pizza up. The dining room is clean, small, and cute and has a TV at every table. The staff was really friendly when I was picking up the pizza, and they even took the time to crack a couple jokes...which is always nice. 
We ordered the vegetarian (minus the mushrooms). I was a few minutes late picking up the pizza, but when I got home it wasn't soggy and was still piping hot. The ingredients seemed very fresh; the tomatoes were very flavorful as were the onions, bell peppers and olives. What made the pizza stand out to me was the crust. As Clint mentioned in his review, it was thinnish, crispy and stayed crunchy throughout our dinner. I like crunchy crust, and typically only when I order thin crust do I get it. This was a nice exception. What surprised me is that the pizza doesn't taste like Villa pizza. Granted, since it has been many years since Villa went under new ownership, I thought maybe there would be similarities. Other than fresh ingredients, it was a totally different pizza...which was nice."}
{"text":"Really good pizza . Thin crust NY style. Be sure to ask for graham. Really great guy!!!"}
{"text":"We walked to Carmine's from the neighborhood for dinner on Friday evening and arrived just before 8:00pm. We opted to sit inside and were promptly greeted and told to sit anywhere we liked. We ordered 2 Club Sodas and started exploring the menu. We decided on the Fried Mozarella for an Appetizer. We liked the size of the cheese slices but they tasted like \"1980's Bar Food Cheese Sticks\". 

For entrees, I ordered the \"Meatballs on a Dish\" and Hubby got the \"Sausage Parmigiana\" Hero. My Meatballs were bland and so bad I ate 1/2 of one out of 4. The sauce was also thin and tasteless. The Sausage on the Hero was also bland and the only good thing to say about it is the bread was really delicious! We were too disappointed to order dessert. We paid our $36.00 tab (That included a generous tip) and left. We probably should have opted for the Pizza but so many things were described as \"homemade\", we decided to go a different way. I guess you live and learn!"}
{"text":"With all due respect to my fellow Las Vegans who rated this place so highly, I must disagree.
Carmine's is, without a doubt, among the worst pizza joints in the valley; let me explain why.
With a name like Carmine's, I'd expect it to serve the kind of pies you usually find across New York City. I mean, this place makes a big to-do about its Italian roots: from the name to the decor to the copies of La Voce (a local Italian-American paper) available inside.
But any similarity to a big-city pizza joint ends once you get your food.
Eating their pizza is like eating cardboard with tomato sauce. You can choke it down, but it's nothing like what you New Yorkers are used to.
Gummy, flavorless and clumsily made, the pizza at Carmines' is even worse than what you can get from the major chains."}
{"text":"It was a pretty disturbing experience for my first time at Carmines. My wife and I saw Carmines while conducting business. Being from N.Y. it appeared to be just like a pizzeria from home. Well, I guess not. Never have I seen take out orders being more important than customers dining in. We were ignored for at least 15 minutes, before anyone acknowledged us, then it took another 20 minutes to serve 2 drinks & a garden salad. It seemed as if you're known you get attention and if not it's whenever we get to you! Then to add insult to injury another 20 to 30 minutes for 2 personal pizzas. Shame on you Carmine !! Far comparison to a N.Y. style pizzeria! No Clams
What the f*%$#. Do yourself a favor get some real servers, because ours had to be the dumbest blonde I've ever crossed paths with!
NEVER EVER AGAIN..........N.Y. HAHA."}
{"text":"Not a joke, I found a leg of a bug in my pasta. Tossed it in the garbage and won't be coming back. This place needs to be analyzed by the health department."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie... this place is so good I couldn't even wait long enough to take a picture of this perfect pizza! We ordered take out but the restaurant is so cute, I cannot wait to dine in! You feel like you're at a real New York pizzeria. They have a couple of big screen tvs too so it's a perfect place to watch the game. The two girls working were so nice and helped us choose what kind of pizza we wanted. Their pizza is my favorite style, thin, somewhat crispy, and not too much cheese or sauce.. the perfect amount. We got the garlic fries as well. I'm excited to try the buffalo fries next time and take full advantage of their bar(major plus). Cute outside patio too.. will be nice when it cools down!"}
{"text":"The best cannoli's in town. A good cannoli is a must in every Italian woman's life. Lol"}
{"text":"Pizza was great, service was fast and friendly, prices what I expect to pay for above-average pizza and the vibe is very comfortable."}
{"text":"Hands down the absolute best calzone out there. The ricotta cheese they put in it is absolutely amazing!!! I'm not a huge fan of their pizza but as long as I can get the baked calzone then I will never turn the place down!!!"}
{"text":"Ugh, awful, awful. What a letdown from the first time! I spent $68 tonight on two salads, two pastas, and one large margherita pizza. Both salads were tiny and absolutely not worth what I paid. The pizza was terrible....no spices, all sauce, very few toppings. And they used sauce instead of real tomatoes. I've had frozen pizza that was better. The pastas were only marginally decent. Very poor quality with a high bill. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was good.   I think I would improve on the sauce a bit.   The dough is excellent but the sauce was missing flavor.   Overall not horrible, but just nothing to push you to return over and over again."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience at this place. I went in on a Tuesday night on my break from work to get a personal pizza which comes with 6 slices. I only got cheese (thank god I didn't get any meat toppings from this place). I ate 2 slices and then went back to work. I started having really bad stomach cramps around 9ish and when I got home an hour later I felt terrible. I didn't feel like I was going to throw up, but that's what eventually happened all night long continuing into the next day. Since this is the only thing I had to eat since breakfast I knew the pizza was the cause of it. It was super greasy, I felt like I was drinking the cheese. The bread is like cardboard, and there was barely any sauce on the pizza. Also it cost me $8 for a 6 slice pizza, I could've got a better deal at any other pizza chain and guaranteed wouldn't have gotten food poisoning! Won't be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Found my new local pizza place. With so many places to choose for pizza I miss the old school New York style. Carmen pizza kitchen seems to have nailed it from the look and the feel if you're eating in with great service to pizza the reminds me of my days Brooklyn. As much as I like ordering in it's great to eat in their cozy dining area with such great service. The pizza is so good I haven't had a chance to work my way towards the other dishes on the menu. When I do I'm sure will be great."}
{"text":"I'm happy with this place, it's new and just around the corner from home. I was hesitant reading some of the reviews, a fair amount said not very flavorful. I would disagree. Sure the crust alone didn't have much to it, but the overall pizza and flavors were great. The crust did have a nice crunchy texture to it, and it's not this big huge crust either. I thought it went well. I had a special and a cheese. The cheese was great, it had a creaminess to it, that it reminded me of eating mac n cheese. The special was good too, onions and peppers were diced so not overwhelming,  helps them cook even too. And the pepperoni and sausage had great flavor. I didn't try anything else. I would say minus a couple points,  my gf didn't like it, but still worthy of 4 stars. I guess it's a hit or miss for some, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have seen Carmine's many, many times, but never ventured there to get anything.  I asked someone in the area if they ever had it and they said, \"Eh, it's okay.\"  Okay doesn't cut it, so I never tried.  Well, while looking for another pizza place last night, Carmine's popped up.  And, when I read that the owner is the old Villa Pizza owner, I HAD to get it.

Well, this was definitely what I expected.  There are very few pizza places that I like, but this is my new favorite!  I'm so glad I took the time to read the reviews to find out about the whole Villa Pizza thing.  I used to eat Villa's from the early 2000's when I first moved here.

You can definitely count on me going back soon.  The downside:  Trying to decide between pizza or something else.  I might just have to order a \"buffet's worth.\""}
{"text":"Ordered pepperoni pizza...$1.75 slice.........absolutely delicious...........thin CRISPY crust................good bye Grimaldis"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but I don't understand the raving reviews for the pizza here. We ordered delivery one night and it was a bad experience from the start. 

The person who answered the phone seemed to have never taken a delivery order before. We ordered the Carmine's Special Pizza, Sicilian style. We were told it would take approx 30 minutes. 

More than 45 minutes had passed, so we called to check on our delivery. She said it should be there any minute. The guy ended up calling us, because he got lost. It was about an hour from the time we ordered. 

When we opened the pizza box, it was a plain cheese pizza. Not only was it the wrong pizza, it was probably the most bland pizza I had ever tasted. To add to it, after we ate it, we both had upset stomachs that night and into the next day. 

To give them credit, when we called to tell them, they asked if we wanted the correct pizza delivered that night or a credit. Unfortunately, being we both felt bad after eating it, we won't be cashing in on that credit...."}
{"text":"I stopped in here after my mani/pedi next door for a quick slice of pie and a soda. What a deal! Only $1 a slice! A real nice guy with glasses greeted me but mentioned he couldn't ring me up.  Two young gals performed my transaction. After I threw my tip in the jar, I thought.. \"Why? There wasn't even eye contact. Let alone a 'thank you' or directions on how I would be receiving my lunch..\" As a matter of fact, not one single word was spoken directly to me. But, I knew why. These folks were working hard with a full house and a new establishment. Then I got my slice. I will say that HANDS DOWN this was THE BEST slice of cheese pizza I've ever had in my 34 years! Despite the lack of communication, I will be back for this heavenly combo of crispy crust, flavorful sauce, and gooey mozzarella. Keep it up, Carmine's!"}
{"text":"Good for a quick bite. Portions are generous and staff is attentive. We ordered the spaghetti and the eggplant Parmesan. Spaghetti sauce was too much like tomato sauce and the eggplant was not crisp like I prefer but the flavored were there. I wouldn't come here if I'm looking for something gourmet but for a weekday pizza night it's perfect."}
{"text":"Such a cute pizzeria! We were driving around looking for an early dinner spot and found this lovely place.

Inside feels like your old school pizzeria. They have cool images/wallpaper of New York scenery. It was fun to quiz the kids on the places in each picture.

Service was good and friendly. Felt like you were being served from someone's kitchen. You can see them making the pizzas from the dining area.

Must try the garlic knots! Omg so yummy. They are so soft, warm, lots of garlic (if you like garlic this is a must), and buttery.

They do $1 cheese pizza slices from 11a-4pm. We arrived at 5p and the server was nice enough to give us a couple slices at that prices.

We also had the Carmine's pizza and it was delicious. 

Will definitely be coming back here again or at least doing delivery!"}
{"text":"This was a quaint little pizza place that we went to and was pleasantly surprised. Their pizzas were not as oily as others and it had a homemade taste to it. We requested for hot sauce but since they didnt have one, they gave us the hot sauce for the chicken wings which ended up to be perfect! It went so well with the pizza. We also ordered their eggplant parmigiana and it tasted wonderful. I could taste the eggplant just right and had lots of cheese.. yum! It was a great restaurant to try."}
{"text":"I am not sure what took us so long to try this. It is right down the street. We had been to the restaurant  next door , and remembered it being busy.  We were hungry for Italian last night and found this on Yelp!  We walked right in. Ordered Lasagna which was meaty and cheesy good. My husband ordered the Chicken Parmesan . It was excellent and extra saucy. You get homemade bread with the entrees but we orders garlic knots as well. Both were fresh , hot, and lacked preservatives. Their Marinara sauce is simple and fresh. Just the right amount of seasoning all the way . We ate half and took the rest home. Just as good cold.  We will have to try the Pizza which looked pretty awesome too."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious!! We've tried other places in the area and nothing compares. The crust and the sauce are like nothing else! Haha"}
{"text":"At Carmine's Pizza a $1 goes a long way. From 11 to 4 P. M, a $1 delivers the taste of New York style pizza 2,540 miles from New York City to Las Vegas. As a transplanted New Yorker that considers Las Vegas the sixth borough, I can attest to the fact that this is genuine New York pizza and not some rubbish. The thin crust topped with tasty tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese that was large enough to fold in half just like a New York slice gives many of the pizzerias that I grew up with in New York a run for the money. The $1 slice is a fantastic deal. For crying out loud, a sausage burrito in McDonald's is more money. Recently before hiking on the Seven Hills community I took advantage of the $1 deal. I ordered two slices and a fountain beverage that came out to $4 and change. 

   It wasn't the New York slice of pizza for $1 during lunch that originally brought me to Carmine's. It was their eggplant parmegana sub which we call hero in New York. More than pizza I love eggplant parmegana. After hiking up on the Anthem East Trail, I made Carmine's my post-hiking supper. The thing about Carmine's is that if you didn't have Yelp or an online map, the place would be hard to find. It is tucked away in a small shopping center at the southeast corner of Horizon Ridge Parkway at Carnegie Street. This small shopping center location is the antithesis to the stereotype New York pizzeria along a bustling New York City sidewalk. Talking about location, the affluent neighborhood near the foothills of the McCullough Mountains is the last place I'd expect to find $1 slices of New York pizza during lunch. 

   The interior celebrates New York City. The pictures display New York City landmarks that include the New York icon Nathan's Famous. The table cloths recall my  memories of dining in the Italian restaurants in Long Island, NY. The inside also reminds me of the Italian restaurant Marios on the classic sitcom \"Taxi.\" Over and above the interior was the delicious egg plant parmegana sub that I was enjoying while looking at the pictures of New York City. My only complaint is that they could of added more eggplant. Regardless it was a delicious sub, than came to around $10 with a fountain beverage. 

    On both visits, the staff was friendly. At Carmine's you interact with the staff when you order and pay at the counter that overlooks the ovens, when they serve the food and beverage to your table, and when you pay. 

   At Carmine's a $1 goes a long way. I am a fan of the $1 New York pizza slice lunch special. This is genuine tasty New York City pizza transported to the dessert. Likewise at Carmine's a handful of $1s go a long way. I also enjoyed the eggplant parmegana sub with the fountain beverage. Ultimately for this review, a $1 brings Carmine's Pizza a long way up the Yelp star rating spectrum to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Nice quiet place for Pizza and Peroni not bad at all order the Carmine Personal Pizza and Peroni. Customer service is good good job Bree!"}
{"text":"Another visit, another Stromboli, dropped one topping choice, added 2, ordered an ice tea and left a reasonable tip and I dang near dropped $20 on this place. WTF was I thinking? Trying to rationalize my stupidity I'll say this is the price I pay for convenience as it is close to work and with a short lunch hour you do what you have to do. But all that money got spent and for what? Boring food. In 3 hours I will have forgotten about what I had for lunch. 

And since I'm in whine mode let's roll with it. I don't mind a place making money but $3 for iced tea is what I'd pay for a bottle at Kauffman Stadium back in Kansas City and we all know stadium pricing is ridiculous. As for the vaunted crust, the same stuff is used to make the Stromboli and it's not all that. And the pizza sauce if you like to taste tomatoes is ok, but it really needs some spices....

The bottom line: I need to go exploring other places to eat and kick myself out of food ruts like crappy strombolis. And who in the heck puts salami in a stromboli? Bleech. That's what I subbed out, give me my black olives and tomatoes, keep the pepperoni and mozzarella. At least the server working today was smiling and was running her rear end off, and the LVMPD gang unit came in which was interesting. But as I said by 3 pm if someone asked what I had for lunch today I'd have to think about it...as it really was unmemorable."}
{"text":"Carmine's Pizza Kitchen advertises slices of NY Style cheese pizza for a $1 so we each ordered one and shared a soda.  We found the pizza to be freezer quality with a crust a little too thick and the sauce/cheese combination pretty ordinary.  As they say, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Yes! Pizza, 3 minutes away and it's delicious. I ordered for pick up but when I drove to the restaurant it's actually a very nice place to eat. They had football on and seating outdoors. Awesome, thank you"}
{"text":"As pizza goes this was average. I made the mistake of ordering delivery (usually pick up) so the XL Pizza & fried ravioli were Luke warm. I ordered pepperoni, onions and extra cheese. $2.25 per topping... I guess the amount was average/acceptable. Ravioli a were a decent size and stuffed nicely 5 pieces for $8.99. Those items plus a 2 liter soda and tip came to north of $44.... Expensive. So my 3 star rating is for over all average."}
{"text":"I love this place so much, their food is super yummy... BUT EVERY TIME WE CALL FOR DELIVERY they say its about a 2 hour wait. I HATE THAT. I can't tell you how many times I've called, they tell me the wait and we say no thanks cuz i want my food ASAP and call some place else... if this is a common issue, hire more help.. PLEEAASSEEEE."}
{"text":"Great people, great environment, great food! Would definitely recommend. Come and get the penne a la vodka"}
{"text":"Love Carmine's. They have the best appetizers. Great customer service. The place inside is busy but they have plenty of tables. Will definitely return here again in the future. A+"}
{"text":"Great place for the family. Pasta al dente, Italian sausage was great. Tomato sauce was awesome. They let my 2.5 yr old daughter make her own pizza at the table. Great time."}
{"text":"Carmines is a 100% great local spot to check out. Anywhere you can go in Las Vegas were the owner and workers are down to earth a easy to talk with is a 5 star on yelp. I will be grabbing my pizza here next time for sure"}

Always a very friendly staff and they make you feel welcome!
Anxious to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"2nd time and will keep coming back. Changed up the menu on my family and they loved it. Staff was professional & courteous- Kept asking me if i wanted anything to drink while i waited for my food. Great food, great service  = Happy Family"}
{"text":"This may be my most favorite Pizza place now. Here are the reasons why...

1. Location - Of course, very near to my house with plenty of parking!

2. The Place - Nice and cozy.  Pictures of NY, NJ which evoke feelings of being authentic NY Pizza.

3.  The staff - All very pleasant, knowledgeable and very service oriented.

4.  The Pizza - Great!  This to me is like NY style pizza. Thin, very simple, none of the ingredients are overpowering.  Easy to fold up the huge slice in half and to chomp away.  Very tasty crust and fresh ingredients. I find may pizzas to have a crust that is very thick and has so much cheese that it is too gooey.  Many have thin crusts and it is not possible to fold them in half and to eat them.  This crust was great!

5.  The Lasagna - One order of this and it was very good. The right amount of cheese, pasta and sauce. The wife enjoyed it and it did not have too much garlic.

6.  The Caesar with Chicken - Tasted good, but a bit underwhelming for the price of 13.00 with the Chicken.  In fact, a bit anemic in the chicken end if you are pay 5.00 extra on top of the 8.00 Caesar Salad. I even think that 8.00 for just the Caesar is too much.  What is in it? Parmesan cheese, romaine lettuce and Caesar dressing with some croutons?

7.  Garlic Knots -  YUMMY.

8. Loaf of Bread with the Lasagna - Just right.

I took all this home for take out. I really liked the restaurant, the pizza and everything about it.  GK says, check it out if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Pizza is average,  lasagna is not great,  service was a little off on Friday night with pasta dishes arriving after half the pizza was eaten."}
{"text":"Thin, crispy, flavorful.  We had a large Meat Lovers. It had just the right blend of meats and cheese. The pie was hot, but without the excess cheese that clings and burns your mouth. 

Service was quick, efficient and friendly.  The restaurant was clean, bright and inviting.  Lots of pictures of New York.  Typical red and white checked vinyl tablecloths. All were clean and in excellent condition. 

Background music was mellow 1970's-80's. 

Mondays are usually slow for most eateries, but there was a substantial lunch crowd.  Not too loud. Able to converse with my wife. 

We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"They opened by the house. Best pizza in town and great $1 slide deal for lunch. Those are 1990s prices. I still need to try other things on the menu, but Im sure I will soon."}
{"text":"Best fing pizza in vegas. no doubt. I am from Jersey and have a definite stereo type about pizza. Carmines is the bomb pizza of Vegas."}
{"text":"I didn't get a chance to try their wonderful pizza by the slice yet, but the ambience and service was great. Simple menu and good selection. I see they do real NYC size pizzas. Usually a good sign. I usually can tell a good NYC slice by having their cheese slice. Until I do, I cannot give 5 stars. Solid pizzeria folks!"}
{"text":"This place is the best pizza in town!!! You must check them out.  Service is very good. Very reasonable."}
{"text":"My partner and I have been looking for an easy pasta place on our side of town since Mac Shack closed. We stopped by Carmine's today for some pasta and calamari and we will be returning! Victoria was attentive and friendly, and she even gave us to-go cups for our soda when we were leaving. Next time we plan to try their pizza. :)"}
{"text":"Well i finally found good NY style pizza.  Nice big thin slices witj very tasty sauce and the chicken wings were crispy with a nice spice and flavor.  Theservice was good and i enjoyed the New York City decor."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for REAL New York pizza, this is where I go. I've brought many people here and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"This has to be the best NY style pizza in town . Absolutely love a few slices and ranch . The chicken fingers were awesome as well . The service was top notch, my drink never went below 1/2 full . These guys are killing it ."}
{"text":"Old school Ny slice of pizza ! Nothing beats it .John John has taken decades of family recipes and kept a Las Vegas family tradition going ."}
{"text":"I've been a here a few times and the pizza they make is pretty good. 
The buffalo chicken pizza is my favorite it had the right crispiness and the chicken was cooked evenly. 

On my recent trip, I decided to try the Chicken Parmesan.
The chicken was a little oily but I didn't care the flavor still tasted great.
The problem was the pasta sauce they used for the penne. 
Tomato sauce tasted like it was poured straight from the can on to the plate. 
It was watery and it had no seasoning, I added red pepper flakes, salt and pepper myself to make it taste acceptable. I feel the dish could have been a lot better.

The staff provide great customer service and they really do seem like nice people. 
I would rate this place 3.5 stars, 

I hope go to back and try others things, hopefully give them a better rating."}
{"text":"I have lived in Henderson now for almost 4 years and the best Pizza by far in Henderson is Joey's NY Pizza on Eastern. Unfortunately Joey's is closed on Tuesday's and today being Tuesday I was craving a few slices. The last time I had Pizza from Carmine's was maybe 6 weeks ago and it was fine. Today was horrible and here is the reason why. I see they changed their Pizza ovens to a conveyor belt oven like you would see at Dominos or Pizza Hut. Any New Yorker knows the only 2 ovens that make good NY Pizza are Bakers Pride and Blodgett. Anything else don't bother eating there. I would hope for their sake they swallow the cost and go back to a real Pizza oven otherwise you might as well eat at Dominos ."}
{"text":"I love Carmines so much omg I come in every day to get 4 sliced and it's not ever enough  Good customer Service and best pizza ever!"}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try out this new pizza joint that I've been hearing about. Upon entering this charming little pizza place, on the southwest side of town, I was graciously greeted by Wes. He politely said that I could sit where ever I want. So I picked the corner facing the whole dining area, adoring the walls, displaying such beautiful NYC pictures. Then Wes asked me what I would like to drink, and I was actually ready for that and my order, I was famished! He clearly explained to me how that dollar slice worked, and the additional seventy-five cent per topping. That deal sounded great to me!  I first ordered a slice of pepperoni and a slice of Italian sausage, and both were absolutely delicious! Where do I begin? That crust was perfectly done! That is essential, because that is the foundation of the pie. Those two slices weren't enough. I was still hungry. So, I then ordered another two slices. This time I got the meatball and the anchovy. It's ridiculous, because it just keeps getting better! I made sure I took a picture of this pair. The first two was eaten immediately. I was too hungry to take pictures! lol After eating all four slices, I still managed to order and eat a cannoli. That just topped my amazing meal! The owner/manager, John, even sat with me, and told me a brief history of his pizza business. That was very nice. It was such an amazing experience. My meal was even better, due to the fact that the service by Wes, was exceptional. He was beyond courteous to begin with. The other lady server, ' brought my first two slices, was a sweetheart. I just don't remember her name. She was also the one that recommended the cannoli for dessert. Which was absolutely delightful. The best part is, this restaurant is  near my mother's house! It'll be systematic for me, to swing by, every time I'm near. What are you waiting for? Just take your butt to the restaurant already! Just to let you know, they have other classic Italian food on their menu, besides pizza. That'll be the next few items for me to devour! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas in town. Slices for a buck from 11-4, but getting a fresh pie is the play here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I lunched here a few weeks ago and the food was great...but the service was less than stellar. In all fairness I was with a pretty big group and we respectfully sat further away from the other dinners to not disturb everyone else's dining experience...but that meant out server often forgot to come check on us. There is an awesome lunch special for two slices and a drink for like $5.00. The menu had variety and they make a sandwich with pizza dough/crust in lieu of bread. I will give it another shot, but next time I will sit in a different section."}
{"text":"Hello, and welcome to Carmines Pizza Kitchen. I was at work and wanted a quick slice of pizza and store is in my posted area. I went in right as the opened and ordered 2 slices of Pepperoni. I was speaking to the owner manager and did not realize that the family that owns this local Pizza place also was the owner of the original Villa Pizza and Carmines that used to sit on top of the hill off Horizon Ridge in Henderson. They also own Ventano's In Henderson as well, which we frequent quite often. Pizza is made to order so there was a bit of a wait, but worth it Pizza was hot and fresh with a wonderful this crust. Had that little bit of cheesy grease that a good pizza shop slice in my opinion should have. 
Thanks for Dining at Carmines Pizza Kitchen.I will go here again or their sister shop in Henderson on Horizon Ridge Parkway. I am looking forward to trying their full menu."}
{"text":"While waited for our amazing food, I watched the owner bus tables and help out his staff. Not only do they have amazing food, but they are down to earth, humble people that just wanted to bring Vegas some good pizza! 

Love this place and the service. The pepperoni rolls are killer!"}
{"text":"Scoping out a few of the new pizza places in the area. We got the mozzarella frita and a large pizza with pepperoni mushroom and olive. The mozzarella came with 3 in an order, which was a perfect number for us, however the breading was kind of generic...tasted like something you could get from the grocery store. Pizza was also just ok...flavor/sauce and crust were ok, nothing too special. And for $40 (including a $3 delivery fee), I thought it was a little expensive. Probably will not be returning."}
{"text":"Update 3/25/17.   After last weeks order I was skeptical about calling again. Seems the pizza is not consistent anymore. Last week it was way over cooked like cardboard and took 2 hours to get here.  And tonight it took 30 min and it was a soggy mess. Was only able to salvage 3 pieces...  looks like I will be looking for a new pizza place.   Vwry disappointed"}
{"text":"Excellent pizzas and wings!!! The NY thin crust reminds of of pizza you can find right in New York, the cheese quality is amazing! Perfect place for after work or on a weekend you just want to kick back with a good slice of pizza and cold beer!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. We got there and were seated right away. The server kept the drunks full which was a plus. Also, what is not to like about a slice of cheese pizza for 1.00."}
{"text":"Finally got to go to Carmines Pizza Kitchen,and it was great. The service the food and the new little spot was wonderful,will definitely be a repeat customer. Thanks."}
{"text":"Solid reliable pizza. The kids like it, the wife likes it and I finish my crust here. Having just moved to the Las Vegas area I've struggled to find a decent pizza kitchen. This is a place I'll come back to."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this, but I have to.  I've been to carmines before, and I always get the mulberry street sub (which I love).  However, the food might not be enough for me to come back.  

I went today with my husband and daughter (who is a first time carmines eater), and from the beginning I could tell it wasn't going to be a good dining experience. 

We sat down at a table. We weren't greeted until around ten minutes. When we were finally greeted, all the waitress said was, \"are you guys ready\"..... not a hello, or an apology for the wait. Anyways, we ordered our food. Not once were we asked if we would like a refill on our drinks, or a \"your food should be right out.\" 

Our food arrived and we must of said thank you to the waitress at least three times without a reply.  again, I loved my sub.  Unfortunately, we weren't asked how our food was or if we needed anything after we got our food. When we were done eating, I was only asked if I wanted a box, when we clearly needed at least two boxes. I'm not positive on this, but I did see two other tables get their food boxes for them.  Which is extremely disappointing. 
The check was then dropped off and again with the poor customer service, no \"thank you\" or \"have a great evening\" \"how was your food.\"...   

I hope the service can be improved so other customers do not have to experience what we did tonight."}
{"text":"We love carmines! Friendly on the phone and in person too! Quick but realistic times on orders."}
{"text":"There is no consistency here.  The owner John tells you one thing and then forgets. He tells you one price and then adds five dollars the next time you try to order, even though you have it in writing from him a price of 6.99 for a kids white pizza now he wants 9.99. There is a big neon sign saying pizza by the slice it doesn't say on the window 11-4 the sign is lit up no matter what time it is, but if you are there one minute after 4:00 pm you are out of luck.  Here is a thought if you aren't going to sell slices all day turn the sign off at 4:00 pm.  The people they have working there don't know what is going on, they are pretty useless if you ask them a question.  The first week they were open it was great but by the middle of May food quality and service had gone to hell.  It's now August and still no improvement. Avoid at all cost it's over priced and not good quality anymore.  Take your business over to Rosati's great pizza more variety and you actually can get anything on the menu from open to close.  The quality is way better and you will save a ton of money."}
{"text":"Update... came here the other night and was really disappointed with how inconsistent the pizza can be. In the past, we've ordered Sicilian and been pleased with the likeness of it to the Brooklyn Sicilian pies we grew up with... you may know the type: a light, thick, crunchy crust. Yesterday, it was practically a thicker version of their regular pizza. No resemblance whatsoever to a Sicilian pie, except that it was square. The crust was thin and doughy. So disappointing and I expected much more. Still, I have always been pleased with their regular slices/pies, hence the 4 stars. You cant beat the dollar slices at lunchtime!"}
{"text":"We have been exploring around our neighborhood near Durango and Fort Apache for different places to eat dinner and this place did not disappoint. The food here is very authentically Italian and the flavors of everything are so tasty and rich. My Chicken Parmigiana was exceptional. The piece of chicken they gave me covered 3/4 of the plate! My wife was nice enough to share a couple of bites of her Eggplant Parmigiana and boy was it yummy. Our waitress was a very pleasant and welcoming young girl and she is the epitome of what awesome customer service is all about! Very positive attitude and a great work ethic that I wish existed in almost every young person like her. We have eaten at a lot of Italian restaurants in our 23 years of marriage (and I do mean A LOT) and this one was one of the best. Great prices and selection too. You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Recently moved from NY to Henderson. Stumbled upon this place in a small strip mall around the corner from my house. As you walk in, you're greeted with photos of old New York. It looks just like the pizza places I grew up with in Brooklyn. We were curious about the $1.00 pizza slices. Most places out here don't sell \"slices\", just whole pies (meaning whole pizzas).

I am a pizza snob. I have to say the pizza is as good as the best I've had in New York. Thin crust, crispy. Just the right amount of sauce and cheese. A good \"slice\" should have a little oil that drips off and this was spot on. They also have calzones and stromboli. If you've never had a calzone, you must try one. It's a pizza dough stuffed with ricotta, mozzarella and usually ham. They also have heroes, salads and a nice selection of pasta dishes. I plan on ordering everything on the menu as time goes on, hoping everything is as good as the slices. 

If you want to know what authentic NY pizza tastes like, go to Carmine's!"}
{"text":"Saw a sign for one dollar slices and decided to check it out. Found it's a dollar for a cheese slice and 75 cents pre topping. When I asked why so high for the toppings. One of the workers got really aggressive towards me for my question. Very unprofessional towards customers."}
{"text":"Carmine's is my son's favorite pizza place.  We love getting the $1 slices when we are in the neighborhood.  The cheese pizza is my recommendation."}
{"text":"Ordered take out last night; large pizza, personal pizza, and a large order of garlic knots. Was told over the phone it would be ready in 30min. Got there in 30min and food was ready, hot, and when I got home it was very tasty. Pricing was fair. Not the lowest around but not too pricey either. Used to go to Joey's up the street towards Seven Hills but every time I went there to pick up my food it was never ready and I always had to wait another 15-30min for it even when I called ahead... also Joey's seemed expensive for what you're getting. Carmine's is a great balance and I was very happy with it. This will be our new spot from now on. Also, the large Garlic Knots is A LOT of garlic knots... maybe 15? Delicious though!"}
{"text":"Always a good place for Italian. We had a mushroom, black olive, and meatball pizza and we each got a pasta plate. I had the Linguine Alla bolognese and my husband had the Linguine and Sausage. 

The food was terrific, served piping hot, the linguine just al dente, the bolognese with meat ragu was thick and filled with pieces of meat. Every bite was stuffed with it. My husbands came with four big pieces of sausage and was excellent as well. 

The pizza was crusted bottom, with a little sweetness to it. A great pizza now and the other half tomorrow will be just as good!"}
{"text":"Sooooo good! Can not get enough of their pizza! My boyfriend likes pepperoni and I'm a plain jane with cheese but the consistency in the crispy crust-not burnt and the amount of cheese and sauce is perfect! We used to go to Rizano's pizza but it became a far drive for use when we moved and Carmine's is right up the street. The pizza is very comparable and the service at Carmine's is much better! The garlic knots are also a must on the menu, you can taste the fresh garlic and the butter/oil mixed with warm home-made marinara is perfect! A must have if your in the mood for pizza! Thank you Carmine family for sharing your delicious recipes with me and my family!"}
{"text":"Gave this place a try after reading all the good reviews.... 
Nice location and clean dining room is about the only good thing about Carmine's.
Disappointed in the food, lacked any flavor. Spinach stromboli was awful, bread tasted like cardboard, mixture of watery frozen spinach and mozzarella cheese filling. 
No joke, Little Caesars makes a better pie than this place. 
20 minute wait for food.. 5 minutes after receiving food, we were offered to go box. 
Overpriced, low quality. 
$7 for a tiny kid's pepperoni pizza.. didn't even include a drink. 
Server was friendly, but lacked any personality or knowledge of menu items. Dropped off check to table and never returned. 
Will not be going back"}
{"text":"This is a quaint little pizzaria right down the street from our house. The staff is the highlight of this place, always very friendly and makes sure you enjoy your meal. The pizza is New York style. They also do a two slices of pizza and drink lunch special for 5$ which is nice."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great service! I'll be having lunch there today, BBQ pizza. Yummmm!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great service, great staff! I'm very lucky to have this place so close to my home!"}
{"text":"Brand new pizza place opened by one of the founders of Villa Pizza.  You can get pizza by the slice, personal pizzas, larger pizzas and many other items and apps.  The toasted Ravioli was excellent, large fluffy, lightly breaded ravioli filled with Ricotta cheese and with an excellent dipping marinara.  The pizza was New York style with a thin crust, crisp at the edges and bendy at the tip.

I was a little disappointed in the lack of flavor to the meatballs and sauce on the pizza.  The meatballs were cut very thin, almost too thin and had nothing to make them stand alone.

The shop has a decent amount of seating and two televisions for gametime viewing.

Still it is a welcome addition to Henderson and there are many other toppings to try.  Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"EDIT:

This is the second part to my review. The owner contacted me, and apparently only wants good reviews listed on Yelp. When I told him that I would not delete my review, he threatened to report my review. Please check the photos for screenshots



**********

I am baffled on how this place has any good reviews. 

This place is right down the street from me, and I would rather drive across town to get quality food than come here again. 

Do you like sugar? Then this place is for you. Everything -sauce, pizza, RANCH DRESSING- tastes like it has a pound of sugar in it. When we voiced our displeasure, the waitress literally stood there and said \"I don't know what you want me to do.\"

While this is true, she has no say in how things are made, she could have at least offered something else, especially when my 12 year old daughter didn't even touch her food. Spent $13 to toss it in the trash. 

Oh, and my sons pizza came out last, which is smart since it was scalding hot and he's 3. 

Even the calamari, breading and all, was chewy, which is odd for making it \"fresh\". 

Save your money and go literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"The lasagna pizza and friendly staff make this place the joint to eat at! Love it! This was the first pizza place we at at when we moved to Vegas and we are gonna have a hard time going anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time and ordered a chicken parmesan sandwich. I was disappointed with the sandwich because it was $8 for chicken meat on half of the hoagie bun. The fries were another $5, plus drink. They should at least add more chicken to match the bun size. I left hungry and disappointed."}
{"text":"Pizza by the Slice. It so Amazing. I grew up in my family's pizza place so I'm kind of picky but this place is pretty awesome and reminds me of Giovannis"}
{"text":"I been here several times before and every time I come in I've always been told to \"please seat yourself\" or \"seat where you'd like\". I came in today with my 2 kids and sat where I wanted to as always, but apparently the seats I chose were \"large parties\" only. The family of 4 close to us were sitting in the same exact size. So the guy working there made us move because we weren't \"large party\". When he came back to get our order at the new table, I asked him what do you consider a \"large party\" he said \"5 people or more\" so my question for him was \" then why does that party of 4 get to sit in a larger table (just the same size as where I was sitting before)...he paused and got a little nervous and \"um..they've got someone else coming\". Howver where he sat me, there was an empty table beside me so if a \"large party\" came in he could've easily put the two tables together. When I said that to him he got nervous and said \"I'm just doing what they tell me\"...  BS dude. By the way the other family was white and I was Hispanic. Maybe if I was white, it would have been a different experience. I sat outside waiting for that table 5th period to come and they never did."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it was good food and good service. We have been looking for a good Italian place close to the house and we might have found it. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time about a week ago.  Wes was our server, he made us feel right at home!  Since we are from NJ, we know what a NY pizza is supposed to taste and how it should feel when it hits your mouth.  We got the large cheese pizza and we were delighted!  Great crust, plenty of cheese, excellent sauce!  They even gave us a small bowl of marinara sauce so we could dip the crust (told you we know how to eat this thing!) and it was so very very good.  Going back today for another large cheese pie.  This is as good as it gets.  :)"}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick dinner last night......had a plain cheese pizza personal size and asked for a crisp crust and guess What!.... it was crisp and not burned...delish!........also ordered meatballs and spaghetti.....3 large tasty meatballs on a large mound of pasta....enough for 2.    Great taste, atmosphere service and value.   Will be returning soon this is my goto pizza place...can't wait to try out the menu!"}
{"text":"Oh BOY! Did we need Carmine close to home!!! Best pizza in TOWN! We love everything! My favorites Sicilian Pizza (with any topping or just cheese) their Brooklyn Cold sub (I like the bread not toasted) DELICIOUS! Lasagna is great, wings tasty! And my sweetheart dies for the Garlic Knots! And you have to end it with the cheesecake! MAMA MIA!
Also the staff is so so sweet and helpful!"}
{"text":"I have tried a lot of the \"non-chain\" pizza deliveries in the Southwest area and Carmine's is by far the best. The pizza is delicious NY-style with quality ingredients, and their fagioli soup is tasty & comforting. I've ordered the Eggplant Parm for take out a few times now, which is also delicious. For quick and casual, \"NY-style\" Italian, this is my go-to."}
{"text":"I was highly disappointed with this pizza place... My husband was super excited that \"the original Villa Pizza\" owners had opened a place down the street.  We ordered a large pizza and wings.... The pizza wasn't bad, it just wasn't good and nowhere near Villa Pizza quality.. Villa Pizza is that good old New York style pizza that you can fold and eat... This pizza just lacked... ugh... I hate leaving mediocre reviews ... but it's what I would want to know! :("}
{"text":"I am all about pizza and the classic cheese pizza is the best here and the ranch is so amazing! I wish they delivered to me. I'm one street past their delivery cut off that is my only con for Carmine's but everything else has been amazing! It's totally worth having to go pick it up!"}
{"text":"I have had good experiences at Carmine's, but I placed a large 180.00 Togo order on Sunday. It wasn't correct at all. Very disappointing. I called to let them know. No call back."}
{"text":"Consistently good pizza.  I consider it a treat!  Also working close by I also take advantage of the lunch specials."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere, very casual and relaxed. It seemed that there was only one server handling all of the tables and take out deliveries as well but other than the server being quite busy, the service itself was great. Very helpful and as attentive as he could be with everything else going on. We ordered the pizza roll appetizer and that was delicious as usual but when I ordered my usual chicken parmesan with alfredo sauce it was drenched in oil. The breaded chicken would push out oil every time I cut into it and the oil was literally separating from the Alfredo sauce in the pasta. There was oil everywhere. I usually love ordering it, but I was quite disappointed with how it turned out. It wasn't like that before."}
{"text":"Pizza is good. The sausage and meatball are delicious. Only issue I have is the slices are so small. Other than that the pizza is proper."}
{"text":"First time to Carmines, and had an XLpepperoni and an order of fried raviolis. Bothe items the ranch and the marinara were OUTSTANDING!!!! The pizza was beautiful and tasted as great as it looked. The fried raviolis still had cheese inside them and were cooked and plated beautifully. This was a delivery experience!!!! Thank you sincerly for giving me what I pay for! Ill be back on my next day off!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is authentic New York pizza. Better than I have had in all of Vegas. It is thin, has enough oil and the cheese is great. I have seen the owner around many times and he is a friendly guy.Prices are good, service is good.  I don't have any complaints. Ample parking too."}
{"text":"So we're locals and been living here for a while now and I've driven past and seen Carmine's for as long as I can remember.

It's 12:03 Wednesday afternoon and this place is pretty busy.

Great place for kids with plenty of tables inside and outside.

So I ordered 3 pepperoni slices and a deep fried pepperoni calzone. 

The pepperoni slices were thin and crispy and lite on the pepperoni slices - kids loved it! 

Hubby got the deep fried calzone.... it was huge... the size of my hand! & loved it too! 

Overall a great local spot with late delivery and pick up times.

Monday - Saturday 11am-10pm
Sunday 12pm-9pm

Major credit cards excepted!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for New York style pizza! My favorites are the classic cheese pizza and Carmines special! Don't skip out on the wings and the house ranch!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GET DELIVERY. They fd up my order on multiple times. Tonight, simple combo pizza they have on menu, I get plain cheese which about $5 less but charged at higher rate. Then I'm supposed to wait 40 minutes for the correct pie to be delivered? Nope."}
{"text":"I can not say enough good stuff about this pizza kitchen!! I've been going to them since they originally opened in central vegas over by sahara and Maryland pkwy. Let me just tell you #bestpizzaever ! Even better fries, and then great desserts!! In this case, less is more. Go and try it yourself!! I promise, #noregrets!"}
{"text":"First time here and I had pretty high expectations, perhaps because of the surrounding area being a tad on the uppity side. We started with the antipasto salad, which was very good and got high marks all around. The salad was better than the pizza, and 3 of us shared the Carmine's Special. It was OK but lacking in the flavor department, which was echoed by my dining mates. The price was right for the pizza & salad, although wine at $7 a glass was too much for my taste. The decor is NYC themed and the restaurant has a nice vibe. 

I considered going to Pizza Rock but like to try new places, and I would love to return to give their pizza another taste. I'm shocked that I haven't stopped by for the $1 slice special that is available in the afternoon!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars because I'd eat the pizza again, but that's it.

Pizza - cheese and flavor is really good, but needs more sauce.

Wings - 1 drum all the rest wings. That's weak. They tasted good.

Garlic knots were hard as a rock.  My kids wouldn't even eat them. Papa johns garlic knots are way better.

Antipasta - Nothing special. The prosciutto was chewy, had pieces of fat that I couldn't chew, and didn't have any flavor."}
{"text":"Saw their ad and thought we would try a new pizza place. We ordered an X-large Carmines. LOVE the decor, LOVE the friendly service, LOVE the cheese and toppings! Oh, but that crust :( I did not care for the crust at all, it tasted like it was previously frozen. Very bland and stale tasting. 

Such a shame because everything else about this place and their pizza was great. I do want to return though and give it one more try.  It was a little pricey at just under $30 for a pizza but if they improve that crust I would be a regular. 

5 stars for service, 5 stars for the decor (felt like a real NY pizza place), but 1 star for the crust."}
{"text":"Carmine's Pizza is the best I've had in Nevada. Even the slices at a dollar a piece are good but their calzones and their Pizza is divine..... the crust is perfect, crispy and Light. They do not skimp on the toppings either. It's definitely my go-to Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"We were going for a few slices but they don't serve pizza by the slice past 4pm! Very disappointing!  We stayed anyway and had to order a whole pie and was pleased aside from the fact that their prices are a little high. Lets talk about the waitress though. ....a young girl that, i didn't catch her name but she has a rose tattoo on her next, was so incredibly sweet and attentive!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with my daughter who is 1 on a Friday before we got my 4 year old son from camp. It is a very authentic experience considering I lived in Italy. Sadly no Italian but for the grandfather who wasn't here. I give 5 stars for authenticity and service but it is more like an Italian place than an Italian American so you need to come knowing that you are coming to an Italian \"pranza\" (lunch), it is not the fake ambient ITALIAN DINNER RESTAURANTS Americans are used to. I do highly recommend it, great service and great food!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from the Horizon Ridge location many times. The food is always good. Last night my delivery took an hour 45 and the pizza was cold when it got here. The driver said he was the only driver for two stores. 

I guess it'll be back to Metro Pizza for delivery from now on."}
