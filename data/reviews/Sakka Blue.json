{"text":"New restaurant to Madison in. located in the old trolly barn in downtown Madison. Loved this place! It's nice to finally have a sushi restaurant that doesn't require an hour drive. The only downfall to the restaurant that I noticed was the small seating area but that is easily over looked once you look at the quality atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great sushi in Madison!  We eat sushi on a regular basis and this place is as good as any. Very quaint but its located in the trolley barn with a brewpub and little girls clothing/accessories store too. Owner is very nice and came out and chatted with us.   There were a lot of to go orders and the place stayed busy all night. We were very pleased with our dinner and will definitely return when we come back to Madison."}
{"text":"Sushi in Madison! I haven't visited Madison in a couple of years and I was thrilled to hear that they now have a sushi bar. It's a cute little place located in a building that also has a brewpub and a beer-making supply store. We ordered appetizers of fried oysters and housemade pickles. The oysters were great. But, the housemade pickles were terrific! It was an assortment of all shapes & sizes and colors of veggies beautifully arranged and served in a large martini glass. We tried to order the app of baked whole smelt but unfortunately they were out. (Next time!) We also ordered one of the sushi roll specials of the day, The Judge (spicy!), and ordered the Dirty Old Man Roll (because with a name like that you've got to try it.) The rolls were wonderful, the raw fish was very fresh, the sauces were delicious and the rolls were large and very filling. The service was good, we were there for lunch. Great place and we will definitely return when in Madison."}
{"text":"Alright people. I know what you're thinking. Sushi in Madison Indiana? How good can it be? Well, it's good. More than good. Great. Fantastic. Sushi is one of my favorite foods, and I've had it in Louisville, Muncie, Florida, Chicago, Indy, New York, etc...and I kid you not...this is the best sushi I have ever eaten. Even better than super high rated places in New York City!!! I couldn't believe it. It is INCREDIBLY fresh and the rolls are creative and to die for. When this place opened, I never imagined it would actually be legit delicious sushi. Boy, was I wrong. It instantly became my favorite restaurant. I moved to Muncie for college, and missed this place like crazy. I tried all the sushi places there, and not one of them even compared to sakka blue. I was disappointed. So I moved on to trying to find one in Indy. Good, but never as delicious. Every time I came home for holidays, I always made it a point to come here. I believe I have tried almost every roll and have never even be enclose to being disappointed. Now working at a boutique on Main Street, I get many tourists that ask my opinion on where to eat. I ALWAYS recommend this place first and foremost. It is definitely the best place to eat in madison. Don't like sushi? That's ok! (You should try some because I firmly believe there is a roll for everyone...) but they also have a pub menu and other great Japanese cuisine. The ONLY downside is that their beer is awful. I'm an avid craft beer drinker, and it is seriously horrible. It tastes like soap, every single beer. Awful. I've tried it multiple times, hoping for him to change the recipe...but no such luck. You're better to stick with some hot green tea. Don't even try it. There are other great beer bars right down the street to get a good brew. But overall, BEST SUSHI I HAVE EVER EATEN!"}
{"text":"I come from the Los Angeles area where every town has at least a couple sushi bars and no one is farther than an hour from the ocean and fresh seafood. So when we were in Madison and our hosts suggested sushi, I was very skeptical.  Okay, so maybe it wasn't up there with the best back home, but it was still very good.   The flavors need to be punched up a bit ( I generally find most foods bland anywhere near the midwest) but the crunchy Hoosier roll was a favorite and was huge with about 8 pieces. The spicy salmon roll was not spicy - at least not to me -  and the veggie tempura batter was a tad too heavy. Good cold seaweed salad on shredded carrot.  Waiter was attentive and food came fast."}
{"text":"I just moved here and was worried that I wouldn't be able to find any good sushi places. Sakka Blue was perfect!!! Sushi is awesome and so is the rest of their food. Great customer service, too!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise. We cruised Madison as we often do when we visit which is perhaps 2-3 times a year and stumbled on Sakka Blue and Sacre Bleu it's a great place with good sashimi and sushi as well as a great bento box and shrimp tempura. I am not an aficianado of Japanese food but I do know what i Like and I do like Sakka Blue!   The Nut Brown Ale that they brewed on site is exceptional."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to get sushi. The food, atmosphere, and the staff are excellent. You can get quite a bit for your money as well. I love eating here my favorite place to sit is the back table so I can watch Allen (the sushi chef) prepare my dinner. The staff is always great they really seem to enjoy there jobs. They will always chat a bit with you and if your not sure about a menu item they know it inside and out. My favorite is either the Jeff roll or the New Kentucky Roll. The offer other cuisine as well. I recommend the Nikki Udon which is a giant bowl of soup, really good if you ask for Siriracha to put in gives it a spicy kick."}
{"text":"Sushi is so-so. Chicken Katsu is thinly thing that made this more than one star. HORRIBLE KITCHEN PHILOSOPHY. It is first-come, first serve for the kitchen. So we were eating sushi while everyone else was done with their meal. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"The Sushi bar is combined with a brew pub - what a perfect marriage!  We ordered the flight - six beers for $5.  They came in mini jelly jar glasses.  The glasses had an odd taste like salty.  I mentioned it to the bartender and she said she would address it.  We each ordered the IPA and shared a crunch roll ($8.95).  It was beautifully prepared and served with wasabi and pickled ginger.  We shared it and asked for some sauces.  One was a spicy mayonnaise and the other was unagi, a sweet, dark syrup sauce.  It was so good we ordered a Jeff roll ($7.95) .  The bill came to $33 plus tip.  The beer was a great chaser to the sushi.  The bar is clean and stark with two big televisions.    There is a pub menu with typical pub sandwiches.  I would absolutely return for the great sushi and beer."}
{"text":"We decided to make the short drive to Madison to try this place after work.  It was packed.  The service was hectic and did not start well.  We waited and finally when we ordered they forgot our appetizer.  That being said the food was excellent.    I had the Judge Roll, with spicy crawfish and crab topped with NY strip steak.  It was excellent.  My wife had the Dirty Old Man roll with tuna and red snapper.  We also tried the other couple's Jeff roll which was deep fried.  It was all extremely well done.  It is a place that we will frequent again.  We all agreed after trying the various rolls we ordered the Jeff Roll is the BEST!  I am not a huge fan of Sushi, but this place had food that appealed to everyone.  It was paired with a microbrewery and the ambiance was very nice. Overall, it was a great time."}
{"text":"The only great sushi available for miles if you live in Madison. The sushi is so fresh and tastes simply delightful. First time I've had decent sushi since moving from Houston. In my opinion it is worth the price for the quality you get.  Will definitely make this a hot spot for us."}
