{"text":"Fresh, fast, delicious & healthy! Who could ask for more?! My favorite is the Gabber w/ Turkey. Avocado, cucumber, sprouts, mayo, tomato & thin slices of red onion on fresh bread. Yum!"}
{"text":"Finally a place that truly makes their soup from scratch. The  Very Veggie Turkey soup hit the spot.  I ordered the combo with a small Greek Salad. It was Fast, Friendly and Delicious and also Clean.  Just what I wanted for a healthy quick and tasty lunch."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in town. The Vincente is my favorite! This is what cafe standards should be held to."}
{"text":"Can't really get better then a family owned deli! The food there is great! I use to go there all the time when our office was close and now that we moved I miss it every day. Try the Godfather, it is so good!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Been a koyal customer for years.  Always fresh.  Always good.  The place is clean and fresh.  The potato salad is KILLER.  BEST chocochip cookies!  This place is better than most sandwich shops in thr Phoenix area.  Keep it up Z-cafe.  Whoop!"}
{"text":"Great little cafe with some really tasty breakfast & lunch items. It's something of a hidden little gem. There space was really tiny at first, but they managed to gather enough steam & just expanded to include the space next door, which ought to serve as a some proof that they have a good thing going. It's a bit funny that they use some portable cooking equipment, but I suppose everyone has to start somewhere & they are well on their way to great things. Good stuff, good people, \"Yay! I'm a fan\"."}
{"text":"Mmmmm yami! That's all I can really say. Food was amazing and fresh. Girl that was taking care of me is so carrying and smiling. It's right by my work so now it's my to go place for lunches."}
{"text":"Your average neighborhood place dishing out delish food!!
I love coming here for Saturday brunches... their raspberry latte is may fav :)

All the sandwiches I tried so far (more than 7-8), they all rock!!
Must Try!!"}
{"text":"I just started enjoying this great restaurant in January of 2014 and couldn't be more pleased. The food is always delicious and the service is spectacular. I mostly call ahead and pick up the order, but have never had to wait for my food upon arrival. Oh, and the prices are pretty darn good too! Do yourself a favor and check this place out."}
{"text":"Best potato salad. Very tasty sandwiches (Vicente on marble rye and Bloom on 9-grain). Good service.  This is our go-to place for sandwiches."}
{"text":"Service is great, dining room is clean. Our order included the alloush and June's special (mushroom melt). Both are super delicious and were served promptly however a couple of flaws gave the overall rating 4 stars. First, the bread was soggy/ chewy instead of crunchy like the toasted marks implied. Secondly, I like fresh crispy greens on sandwiches (the spinach was limp and soggy. But that might be just my opinion. Anyway, I totally recommend this place but keep this in mind so you can adjust if necessary and have a happier experience!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I always get the egg salad sandwich or the hummus wrap. I wish more company's took as much pride in there product as Z-cafe does. I will continue to eat here 2-3 times a week until they close or I die."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a great breakfast burrito place in the area, and have finally found it! I ordered the potato burrito with bacon. The food was great quality, cooked perfectly, and the salsa was delish. Can't wait to try other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here for the first time today and it was AMAZING. The potato breakfast burrito was perfection and their coffee was delish. Plus, the staff was super helpful! I'll definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"Food is fresh and very tasty. The employees are nice and helpful. Dining room had an eclectic group of patrons. Restaurant is clean and food was ready quickly."}
{"text":"Herd so many good this just to be disappointed. I tried the godfather and the they over powered it with peppers so I took it apart and only 4 slices of meat all on super soggy  bread so I went to eat the seasonal fruit that was unripe and not even in season 

Not my friends sandwich also very bad asked for no tomato's and no mustard and yet they were still on the sandwich also asked for onions on it and she was given the smallest amount you and think of 

Restraint was also very uncomfortably hot 

Very disappointed and will not be returning"}
{"text":"Great local lunch spot. Been going here for a couple years now and can't remember ever coming away disappointed. After they expanded their seating area, it became much easier to come here because the service got faster. Have tried multiple items on the menu and always go back to the Z-Chick. Owners work the counter... Great for lunch. Will continue to come back."}
{"text":"We found Z-Cafe via a coupon in our Entertainment book and have returned many times! It's a cozy little sandwich place with friendly owners and solid food. And the best chocolate chip cookies you'll find anywhere. Highly recommend for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Love this shop! Been a few times & always get the Alloush. Love the chipotle sauce & tell all my friends & family to try it out."}
{"text":"They have very good sandwiches and their southwest salad is great as well. This restaurant is also a very clean establishment. The only gripe I have is that the sandwiches are fairly small. Still good food though!"}
{"text":"I have driven past this place countless times and finally decided to give it a try. It looks smaller from the outside than it is on the inside. The staff was very friendly and made some suggestions from the menu. I ordered the Manhattan Club on sourdough bread and was well pleased. The didn't skimp on the meat and the sourdough was very good. I definitely recommend Z Cafe. Be aware they are only open until 4."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches and pastas ever; not to mention their great desserts.  The food is fresh and delicious! My son goes there almost every day for over a year and they have his order down pat.  The owners are almost always there and they are so kind and friendly. Honestly,
a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"For breakfast, get the Albuquerque. For lunch any sandwich is a good sandwich but the godfather is amazing.  This is probably my favorite sandwich shop in Arizona. If you're a fan of hot sandwiches go straight for the godfather and don't look back.  They have decent coffee as well."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying Z Cafe several times a month for the past 3 years and I never tire of the delicious food on the menu. Z Cafe is one of my favorite local restaurants. Great for breakfast and lunch. Everything is always fresh and made to order. Quality delicious food at a great price. Super friendly service and tasty fresh baked cookies. The smoothies and coffee drinks are great too! If you haven't been here yet make it a priority."}
{"text":"I love this place. We have ordered their food through my office for years, and they are consistently fresh and delicious. I have only eaten onsite once, and I loved the atmosphere. It is a very small cafe, but the staff is friendly no matter how busy they are. This is a great find!!"}
{"text":"Very good and affordable deli sandwiches.  The staff was very friendly.  The decor is very casual with a few simple tables and chairs.  Both my gf and I enjoyed our sandwiches immensely.  Z-Cafe has now been added to my list of \"local go to\" places."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!! Everything is under 10 dollars. The marbled rye bread is amazing here. I would definitely recommend you to try this this cafe. The only thing that sucks is that they are closed Sundays, which are my only days off. I will definitely come back 10/10."}
{"text":"Make sure you check this place out. The best breakfast burritos in town hands down. Their lunch menu is nothing less than amazing. If you want a delicious sandwich you won't be disappointed. Not to mention Dan and his wife are almost always behind the counter and are a pleasure to talk with. Very genuine and have a great staff. Love this place"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time today, and I love this place! Everyone who worked there was incredibly nice and friendly. Their soda machine was not doing well on carbonation, so the owner personally jumped up and got us several cans out of the fridge and said we could have as many as we liked. The food is really high quality. I got Maddy's Grilled Cheese (cheddar, cream cheese, and avocado) on sourdough with a side of potato salad, and it was great! The bread was perfectly grilled and the potato salad was really creamy and a bit different from regular American potato salad (and really tasty). My husband got the Godfather sandwich, which he really enjoyed. The ambience was very casual and laid back. Not exactly cozy, but you can sit down to eat your lunch or breakfast in comfort. I'd highly recommend it to anyone in the area looking for a good sandwich."}
{"text":"The best potato salad I've ever eaten in a restaurant! Quality ingredients, friendly staff, clean dining area. I wish there was more outdoor seating. I had the Reuben on marbled rye and it was wonderful. The meat is paper thin and stacked high. There is something for all taste buds. Even when going in a group of picky coworkers, they all cleaned their plates."}
{"text":"My 3rd time here and its always been delicious. I will definitely continue to go back!"}
{"text":"The staff is always super nice and the food is delicious. They use Boar's Head meat which is the best never had any issues with this place. It is my favorite"}
{"text":"I love supporting local businesses. Food is delicious, service was fast and friendly. Restaurant is clean and there's a variety for things on the menu. I really enjoyed my experience."}
{"text":"Always fresh and friendly atmosphere. Use them a lot to do my work when I need a break from the home office. Fast wi-if and yummy food!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food!  Very fresh ingredients and super friendly service.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"All around \"Amazing\" Cafe!
My fiancé and I will come back here again.
Friendly and helpful staff makes it very comfortable to choose the right dish for your taste buds."}
{"text":"I have been to other businesses close by but had not tried Z-café yet.  It's a small diner with fresh ingredients - sandwiches made to order.  I'm a fan of fresh made and what I really liked as I could pretty much customize anything they had.  They even offer you the ability to create your own sandwich - very kool!  I decided on the Turkey, Bacon and Avocado sandwich but I asked that it was in a spinach wrap.  It came with a bag of chips and a beverage.  The wrap was excellent and served up in minutes.  I would go back to try some of the other sandwich's that they offer.  Price point is slightly high but overall quality was superb!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their breakfast burritos! Great small business to support! Their iced coffee is good too. Haven't had a bad experience yet!"}
{"text":"Good lunch and breakfast fare. Breakfast is only served until 1030. Service is good and they have a great POS system.

Indoor seating is adequate and gives you a view of your parked car. It appears a lot of commuters stop in there for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Z-Cafe has turned into one of my favorite places for lunch. Their breakfast burritos are a favorite of mine as well. I crave Z's all the time (even before I got pregnant haha)! Always friendly people working and it feels good to be giving money to an incredible small business rather than a bland chain. Everything is so fresh, delicious, and quick. If you haven't tried this place yet-you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Omg! This place is awesome. I have been for lunch and dinner several times. I have enjoyed each item I have tried. I don't eat meat so sometimes it's hard to find a good place that you can go to when you're with people who do eat meat that everyone will like, there's something for everyone there. everything is fresh, delicious I can't speak highly enough about it."}
{"text":"Happened upon Z-Cafe by accident but glad I did. Ordered the Mushroom Melt and it was delicious. It was a little pricey but the service was good. Definitely will go back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This is a very nice little cafe.  I have been here twice and had sandwiches both times.  Really good!  My last time in I had the Turkey, Bacon and Avocado on Whole Wheat.  The bread is really tasty and the meat is good quality.  

I would choose this place over Subway 100 times out of 100.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Every time I come up here I stop in for lunch. The food is always fresh and amazing. The owners and staff are always friendly and nice. My favorite sandwich is the Z Chick amazing!"}
{"text":"this place food is great. even my husband who is the pickest eater really liked his sandwich that he had. I had the egg salad which is oddly difficult to find in the city and it was perfect. the potato salad is also the best I've found so far."}
{"text":"I get the Manhattan and add the chipotle sauce, because it's amazing. The boyfriend gets the Dillon.  Everything I have had has been fresh and awesome!"}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp after some very successful searches on the app in another city so I decided I would try it out in the Phoenix area. 

The Z-cafe is in a very good spot adjacent to the 60 freeway and far enough away from a major intersection so as not to cause difficulty getting there. I read a few reviews on Yelp and decided to check it out. The place doesn't have much décor but that's fine because what matters is that the food tastes good, and taste good it did. 

I ordered the Z-light which is a simple turkey sandwich with tomato, lettuce, and avocado. I got it with the sourdough bread with regular mayo and some fruit, no special requests. I waited about 10 minutes and boom my sandwich arrived, spear of pickle and all. A few bites into it I realize, wow! This sourdough is great! I particularly like a stronger tasting sourdough and that's exactly what it was. The mayo they used was great as well, again great tasting, no need for extra as i usually order, veggies were pretty fresh and the fruit, which was watermelon, was awesome!

Great first time experience, I'll definitely be going back, as I love a goood sandwich."}
{"text":"Godfather on sourdough with bow tie pasta. I haven't even tried anything else on the menu yet because the Godfather is so good."}
{"text":"Excellent burrito. Real food. Good coffee"}
{"text":"Can I say yummy!!!

Great food, great delivery service.  I have never eaten at their place, but have never been dissatisfied with my order.  You gotta try the cookies!!"}
{"text":"Super yummy breakfast! Wife and I got mushroom bacon panini and zinke burrito with Delicious fresh salsa.  Will definitely eat there again and very excited to try lunch sometime!"}
{"text":"Totally love this place. Perfect lunch stop. Options for everyone & don't forget the half & half. The Blt + Swiss with Half Soup Or Fruit On The Side!!!! Perfect!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place, I go here literally every weekend and love all of their sandwhiches. Their sides are all homemade and are very delicious (especially the potatoe salad). The staff is very friendly and the owners are always there greeting people. Can't say enough great things about Zcafe, best sandwhich place in town!"}
{"text":"Z-Café is amazing. I have been going here for the past couple years and they never disappoint. They are super fast and the food is fresh and so good. Everything is homemade including soups, dressings and salsa. My favorite thing on the menu is the Southwest Breakfast Burrito! I hardly ever write reviews but I have to support this place because they are truly wonderful."}
{"text":"Love this place. Love the owners. We eat here as much as we can we don't live near so we come when we can. Sandwiches are awesome especially the Alloush and the southwest salad is great.   Try the home made chocolate chip cookie OMG are they good!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over several years now and have never been disappointed. Local shop run by a husband and wife team who are very nice. The sandwiches are made to order and your choice of pasta salad, potato salad or seasonal fruit that comes with it are very fresh. The bowtie pasta salad is my favorite! Sandwiches can be made as wraps or on your choice of bread. I've had many different sandwiches and they are all good. Today I had the Southwest potato soup and it was the best I've tasted. They have a light lunch which is half sandwich and soup or salad combo which is a nice option. They also have fresh brewed iced tea which I love! 

If you're in the area and looking for a great lunch try this place out!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and the staff is always very friendly! My personal favorites are the Roast Beef sandwich and the Chicken Caesar Salad. Not to mention that they serve the best potato salad I've ever had. Stop by for lunch and I promise you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I worked at Zcafe for a few months while I was in between my property management jobs... coming from a previous employee I can assure you that they are SUPER CLEAN and everything is made FRESH. The owners are involved with everything and take great care of their customers and employees. I would recommend anything and everything on their menu. You can't go wrong, absolutely everything is amazing!"}
{"text":"Had this for lunch today, first time there.  Cute little shop with a great lunch menu!  I ate the southwest salad in the small size and it was HUGE!  The ingredients were fresh and they were really fast getting out my order.  Very clean and the staff was really friendly.  I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I order the turkey bacon avocado on a croissant with a side of watermelon (the seasonal fruit) I was perfectly satisfied and fell in love when I took the first bite! And the fact that the bacon was still hot was nothing less than impressive. Delicious food great prices I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I have not found a better place for a sandwich yet.  The turkey bacon avocado is so good that I think about ordering it the next day while eating it for lunch.  The meat is Boar's Head- awesome.  The breads are amazing, the sauces are delicious and the side dishes are incredible! There isnt a single thing I have ordered that I didn't like.  They don't deliever, but it is worth the drive I assure you.  If you are hungry, go there.  Right now.  Seriously, stop reading and go to Z-Cafe.  Order the Turkey Bacon Avocado on Ciabatta.  Thank me later =)"}
{"text":"I went to Z cafe for the first time for lunch.  The staff was very friendly, I was greeted with a warm smile.  I had a delicious deli sandwich and homemade side of pasta salad.  While ordering I noticed 3 pans of homemade cookies so I bought 1 of each variety, yummy!  They also serve breakfast which I plan to try. It is clear why this restaurant has been in business for over 10 years, great customer service and tasty food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This place has become a favorite of mine. Great reuben sandwich and all of their  sides are amazing. If you haven't been you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Truly a hidden gem. I probably wouldn't have thought twice if someone hadn't told me about it, but I'm so glad they did! First of all, their staff is super friendly. And their eggs are phenomenal. They have some really great flavor combinations. Simple coffee menu but always delicious. And they'll basically make anything you order, so thanks for that guys! Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Z Cafe is my ideal local deli.  I love nearly all of their sandwiches, they serve some of the best potato salad I've ever had, and their owners/employees are very nice."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a quick sandwich and coffee. I got the Alloush hot sandwich and the hot Milky Way espresso which were both  phenomenal taste explosions in my mouth. Friendly staff and fair prices. I will most certainly return for another visit!"}
{"text":"Umm... excuse me? I just stopped in to get a simple sandwich... Just something edible from the closest cafe to my office...
I did not expect to get THE MOST DELICIOUS SANDWICH that I have eaten in YEARS!! What?!?!?
This place is PHENOMENAL!! From the espresso to the macaroni salad (yes, even the macaroni salad is amazing!!)
And the customer service was top notch!!
Yay! I'm so glad that I strolled into this place... You'll be glad that you did too!! 


So I've been back 3 times this week... I can't get over the Raspberry Truffle Latte  So good!!!  The breakfast (Potato Burrito) is also delicious!! And the Meltz Wrap!! Please eat here NOW!!"}
{"text":"My co-worker introduced me to this fantastic place for lunch one day, now I go there almost every Saturday and enjoy the same sandwich. The owner is so friendly and works side by side with the staff every day. The meats are amazing, right away you can taste the difference in the high quality Boar's Head that they use. Whenever I order fruit as a side dish it is always the most fresh of what is in season. Everyone that I have brought here has commented that they are now \"addicted\"."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches and great service!  It's a mom and pop place with a laid back atmosphere.  The potatoe salad has no equal and the freshly baked cookies are chocolate wasted wonderful!  I ordered an egg sandwich for my son, not realizing that they didn't serve breakfast after 10:30.  Egg salad hit the table and I thought he was gonna lose it.  No sweat, they made him a grilled cheese and made me look like a hero.  Don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"So glad that we stopped by Z Cafe while we were in the Mesa, Arizona area.  We were very pleased with their sandwiches -- my son had a chicken caesar wrap and I had a patrami sandwich on rye -- both were superb!  We will definitely patronize them again!  :o)"}
{"text":"So fresh and simple I had to give 5 stars. Had the Manhattan Club which was Turkey, Ham, Bacon, Cheddar, Lettuce, Tomato, Mayo & Mustard on 9 grain bread. It was excellent."}
{"text":"At first I was disappointed that breakfast was over at 10:30, but I'm glad it did because I ended up getting the Alloush and it was phenomenal! Great food and great service! Everyone was friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. It is clean inside and the person at the counter seemed nice.  Got the spicy burrito with double meat ham and sausage.
It was delicious!!
If I wsn't from out of town, I'd come back here for lunch! !  

I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So far I've had the turkey bacon avocado  and the Ruben. The Ruben was good, no doubt but not the best. I give it 3 1/2 stars, but the turkey bacon avocado was the best sandwich I've had in a long time! They really hit out of the park with this one. I'll continue coming here because of this and of course the awesome (and fast) staff. Good job guys!!!"}
{"text":"Bummer. Didn't get what I ordered. Didn't notice until I was on way and couldn't turn back. Even if I did, my original call in order took over 20 minutes and wasn't ready when I got there."}
{"text":"First time here. This place is awesome! The Bloom is amazing! Can't wait to try a breakfast burrito"}
{"text":"I eat here every week. The food is varied and fresh. They always adapt my dish when I ask. The service is excellent and everyone is friendly. This is a local family owned place. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Z cafe is always on point. Good sandwiches i tried the bloom and it was great. Their potato salad delicious as always. Staff are friendly and the place smells really nice and clean. And hey... support local !! :)"}
{"text":"Z-Cafe is a very cool little restaurant that serves up both Breakfast in the morning hours and a tasty Lunch during the rest of the day. They also have some really good looking Smoothies and fresh Cookies to enjoy.

Just happened to find this place with my Yelp \"nearby\" button. I had the craving for a hot Sandwich and the photos got my stomach growling. Their PDF menu on the internet has all of the items they serve and it is very easy to navigate.

Ordered the The Bloom Sandwich with Turkey, Bacon, Provolone, Cheddar, Avocado, Red Onion & Chipotle Sauce on Sourdough Bread with a side of their Homemade Potato Salad. It was very delicious and all of the ingredients were very fresh.

They have several other cold and hot sandwiches as well as breakfast items in the morning There are also Soup and Salad options that can be ordered as a meal or they can be combined with a sandwich purchase.

Service was very friendly and the place inside is very clean. I was very impressed with how important it was to them that my visit was both pleasant and expedient.

Definitely will be back to try out some more of their yummy menu. The prices are very reasonable and the portion sizes are just right without going overboard and putting me into a food coma. SAMMY TIME!

4 STARS"}
{"text":"So this place has never let me down. I'm always scared of going out to eat with my Celiac Disease BUT Z-Cafe has always had the best cross contamination avoidance practices and their food literally comes in fresh every morning. I know. I've been there when the delivery comes in. Good to know there are people willing to run their business the right way for the freshest ingredients and the most considerate staff. No one ever gives me funny looks when I ask about cross contamination avoidance practices & gluten free options."}
{"text":"After having lunch here, I'm upset at having passed by this place so often and never stopping in.  There were lots of \"emergency personnel\" which is generally a sign of good eats.  My lunch was delicious and the service was friendly and fast.  Looking forward to coming again!"}
{"text":"I love going to Z-Cafe! Im a huge fan of their potato breakfast burrito, lunch options, and their iced green tea. I've always had friendly and prompt service, and when ordering to go via phone, my order is ready when I arrive. Want to avoid the long wait at Starbucks? They've got an espresso machine as well."}
{"text":"Great little sandwich shop. I had the Turkey, Bacon, & Avocado sandwich. It had a chipotle mayo that was very good."}
{"text":"I am giving a 4 star review because I think this place has great potential and that I need to try more things. I ordered the breakfast burrito with potato. I'm a fan of crispy fried potatoes, especially inside of a burrito. These were more of the sautéed soggy variety so I ended up picking them out. The rest of the burrito was just ok. I paid an up charge for bacon and there wasn't much there. I also got an almond milk latte. I prefer really hot coffee, so next time I know to order it extra hot. The taste was just so so, but I'm chalking that up to personal preference. The customer service is top notch; they offered recommendations and made the food and drink fresh. There are lots of things left to try here and I think other menu items might be a better fit for me this the 4 stars.

Update: Lunch sandwiches are GOOD. I only wish they offered fries as a side. If you're in the mood for a hot sandwich order The Bloom, really good. If you want a cold sandwich the Turkey Bacon Avocado is good. I like the 9 grain bread."}
{"text":"The guy that owns this place is super friendly! They have this bow tie pasta salad I am addicted to. Favorite sandwich place!"}
{"text":"I found this place by accident.   It comes up on the map app as a coffee shop.   Which it isn't,  really,  but still a Very nice little 'cafe'.  Service was impeccable.  The young lady taking orders is very polite,  engaging,  helpful.  The restaurant was clean and open.  I had the soup (potatoe), which was very good (and hot).  I hate lukewarm soup.  Turkey, bacon, avocado sandwich was also freshly made and as good as the other reviewers stated.  Well worth a stop for lunch, there's some breakfast items on the menu as well."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is always busy which is a good sign that they consistently have great food. My favorite thing to get is half salad half sandwich because the salad is still pretty big. It's always fresh and well prepared. The people who work here are always pleasant and will give good suggestions if you're a first-timer. I highly recommend this place especially for lunch when you want a healthier option where you will still feel full and satisfied. Plus, ordering in advance and picking up is a great option for the busy lunch hour."}
{"text":"This place has the best sandwiches in town. They let you customize your sandwich, and everything is priced fair."}
{"text":"We had never been here before, glad we found it! Awesome selections and they even have a great coffee bar, had the Dylan sandwich on ciabatta and loved it!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The staff is friendly,  the food is delicious and they have great prices. I love the southwest wrap.  You can even pick what kind of wrap you want.  The wrap comes with a pickle and a side.  They also prepare the food quickly so you can still stop even when you are in a rush!  I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Just had best breakfast burrito in my life. Eggs done perfectly, pepper jack cheese amazingly soft and squishy. Potatoes are perfect. Not stuffed full of junk, you taste everything. Was going to take a picture of my meal, but I ate it too fast."}
{"text":"Small portions for the price. The Z-Chick that I had turned into a wrap was pretty good. Pasta salad was not my favorite."}
{"text":"The cafe is alright. Their vegetarian selection leaves a lot to be desired. I'm sure their other food is fine."}
{"text":"Good. I got the BLT w avocado on sourdough. The bacon was a little too chewy but the other ingredients were fresh and plentiful. The potato salad was really good after I added some salt. Not the best sandwich I have ever had but I might stop in once in awhile."}
{"text":"We live nearby and this is one of the friendliest places in the area to go.  the owner is always welcoming and the staff friendly.  In 4-5 years of going there we have never once had a bad meal or unpleasant visit."}
{"text":"A perfect sandwich place. We loved our food. I got the Dylan with a side of potato soup. Both were a little spicy. My husband got the turkey bacon, avocado. We also ordered smoothies. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is good.  Soups are decent.  Some of the hot wraps come out soggy cause of so much juice or dressing or what ever they put on it.  Other than that the flavor is there.  Good quality good and reasonably priced.  Great quick lunch spot.  Very above average of your used to traditional faster food lunch/sandwich shops (Subway, jimmy johns, etc)"}
{"text":"I've been on the watch for a decent sandwich shop in the east valley for some time. How this place didn't get on my radar sooner, I don't know. I'm glad that I found them and I've been extremely happy with my meals and service on my recent visits here. While in kind of a dated strip shopping center, the inside of this restaurant is clean, tidy and open. Their menu has a lot of great options for breakfast and lunch, including some specialty coffee drinks. I'll be back for sure. Give them a try and take advantage of the little check in special their running now."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an awesome lunch spot look no further! Z Cafe is always fresh and super delicious. The Avocado BLT is my favorite. Staff is always very friendly too!"}
{"text":"Great spot for casual dining. Tasty food and reasonable prices. I ordered the turkey panini and enjoyed it. The service was good as well. Can be a bit loud around lunchtime."}
{"text":"Always a great choice for a quick and tasty sandwich or an awesome breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a sandwich or breakfast burrito. The food is really good. A tad over priced and the customer service could be better but if you are more concerned about quality breakfast/lunch food then this a great spot."}
{"text":"Super yummy sandwiches! Melanie is always so helpful! Come try the z chick!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches and priced appropriately. I miss the east coast for delis such as this so it was a pleasant surprise to move up the road from this gem"}
{"text":"First visit:  very good locally owned place.  Breakfast burrito was quite good and the salsa put it over the top.  Good service.  I will return."}
{"text":"This is the second time I came here with my co-worker. Their food is tasty and fresh. The service is fast. The staff is friendly. It's clean. What more can you ask? I got the Vincente on a ciabata- which had turkey, cheese, avocado, and mayo. The sandwiches come with sides you can choose, like fruit, potato salad, or macaroni salad, etc. I had the potato salad and it was yummy. Also you get a pickle spear. Nice. Coke products on the fountain (yay) and it looks like they have a nice coffee machine. I am sure when I take my husband ther he will have to try that. ;P They also have breakfast burritos (yes!), soup, salad, and homemade cookies. I am sure that is not a comprehensive list- just what I noticed.

A good solid lunch spot."}
{"text":"We always have great food when at Z's. We introduced some friends to them this trip and they all agreed- Z's is terrific. Great selection of fresh breads, produce and meats. This review is making me hungry!"}
{"text":"All the reviews are true! FRESH FOOD!
Had the spicy burrito, and man was it good, cant wait to try out another item on the menu when im in the area!
Keep this business up and running! Definitely deserves my business!"}
{"text":"My mom and I go here quite often for lunch. They recently expanded to the space next door so there is more dining space. The owner walks around talking with customers when he is not in the kitchen. I always appreciate that in a business."}
{"text":"I will preface this review by stating I think this place is known for their sandwiches and I did not order a sandwich...so perhaps its worth another visit to try a sandwich and perhaps update this review...

With that said I ordered the chicken caesar salad.  It left a lot to be desired.  The size of the salad was more than sufficient even though I had the small but the plate was basically a pile of dry lettuce with some cheese and some croutons.  I expected a nice portion of grilled chicken on top but instead I had maybe an ounce of deli sandwich style chicken and the Caesar dressing on the side.

Like I said maybe I should have tried a sandwich and I only hope their sandwiches are better than the salads because this salad left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"No matter which sandwiches you decide on skip the mayo & ask for their homemade chipotle sauce instead.  Yum yum"}
{"text":"I had a Godfather Sandwich on Chipotle wrap and a cookie for lunch. Both the wrap and the cookie were simply awesome. I had some macaroni salad on the side, which was delicious as well. I am glad, that I found that place. Service was also awesome."}
{"text":"I've been to Z-Cafe several times and each time I'm impressed. All the food is made fresh while you wait. I LOVE their burritos... the potatoes in them are so perfectly cooked and I'm SUCH a fan of their sandwiches, too. Good Boar's Head meats, but I think I like their bread the most!
The salsa is great, although the hot one isn't really hot at all. I'm luck enuf to live very close, but even if you don't, the trip is worth it."}
{"text":"Z-Cafe has turned what could be considered just another boring sandwich into something amazing and FAR from boring! I never even realized how fancy macaroni salad could be until I met this place. I love that the go to sandwich option is now more like a special occasion I need to find an excuse to celebrate often. So glad I found you!!"}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich shop in Arizona, bar none. The Dylan was a special a few months back, but can still be ordered. It is truly a master crafted wrap of goodness from the gods of sandwiches."}
{"text":"Been coming here for about 4 years. Their salads and sandwiches are fresh tasting and have great flavor. Only complaint is that the sides are a bit small."}
{"text":"Wife picked up turkey, bacon, tomato wrap and a pasta salad. Normally to go orders aren't the best when they get home, but it was delicious! The chipotle mayo added great flavor. Will definitely be back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"The Aloush with chibatta is my favorite. My wife and I found this place a few years ago and we'll go out of our way just for lunch. Their cookies are great too. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm an our of town guest , a friend of mine took me here , it was delicious.  Had tuna sandwich , was very good . Will be back when I visit Arizona again"}
{"text":"Great service and really great food. I wish they would sell there tomato vinaigrette, it's so amazing."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast Burrito I have ever had! Hands down!

Good vibe fits hand and hand with food. Healthy fresh food for a great price. You can definitively taste and see food cooked on the spot. A lot of options on the menu too! Really happy I found this place today! Thanks guys"}
{"text":"As far a Deli's go, the East Valley is really lacking. Luckily Z Cafe is here to save the day. Everything is made fresh at the counter right in front of you from premium ingredients. The prices for what you get are absolutely outstanding. I recommend the Manhattan Club."}
{"text":"- Recipe for an upset stomach-

I came in expecting great things 

Ordered the \"Godfather\" sandwich 
- greasy 
- heavy
- too salty 
- stomach cramps for a day
- the potato salad was decent 

$8 for a small mediocre painful sandwich ?

Never again ; I'll go to IKE's"}
{"text":"Food is amazing , love the Maddys grilled cheese. Not so thrilled with the staff, in on Saturday March 14  2015 it was slow so I expected quick service, however as I patiently waited and listened to the young girl preparing food for the other employees and what they wanted in their sandwiches, I grew more impatient. Then I asked a question about re sandwich I had already ordered and was snapped at( I hadn't eaten the Maddy before ) will return again and not let some young girls bad work ethics keep me away from yummy food :)"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh sandwiches. I have tried several different items on the menu and I have always been very happy. I love egg salad, but everything is good. Their gluten-free bread is amazIng. I get it and I'm not even gluten-free. I am looking forward to trying their breakfast!"}
{"text":"Some of the best deli sandwiches I've ever had. The owners make most everything from scratch and remember your name. Not to mention the potato salad is amazing."}
{"text":"Fresh... Excellent and friendly service! Sandwich was fresh served with a pickle and fresh fruit."}
{"text":"I love this place and their gluten free bread options. Their ingredients are fresh and their potato salad is the best!"}
{"text":"ItOmg!!!!! Soooooooo goooooooooood!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Best sandwiches I've ever had, ever! And I've eaten a lot of really good sandwiches.

First I had the signature burrito, awesome. Then I had the Aloush, wow! Then...then I tried the godfather. Yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I went 3 times in one week and took everyone I knew back here. I got the Dylan and it was soo good that I was afraid to try anything else. I got the potato salad for my side and couldn't be more happy. 

It's worth the drive. It looks out of place in its location, but don't let that stop you. This is a serious sandwich spot."}
{"text":"This tiny looked-over sandwich shop has been conveniently located at Baseline and Alma School for as long as I can remember and their quality has never wavered.  They offer both hot and cold sandwiches, or you can make your own by choosing from a huge list of topping and bread options (including gluten-free bread).  My mother-in-law's favorite is their grilled cheese, which added cream cheese, bacon, and tomato, to make it ultimate!  Along with sandwiches, they offer salads and soup, plus hot and cold drinks.  I hit this place whenever I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches anywhere! Everything is made fresh and is outstanding. My favorite is the Turkey, Bacon, Avocado ....amazing! Even the sides are made fresh daily. The potatoes salad is out of this world good!
You got to try this place!"}
{"text":"I love small locally owned lunch spots.   The owners take pride in the food they prepare!!!  I have had a varitey of their sandwiches and soup of the day and never a bad meal.  The sandwiches have allot of great combinations and are far from your boring Subway or Quizno's.  House made pasta and other salads are allways fresh.  They also make some nice breakfast goodies but, generally I allways roll in at luch time.   Give Z Cafe a try !!!!"}
{"text":"First time and I'm impressed. 1st thing I noticed. CLEAN! Love that you can see into the kitchen. 2nd very friendly and patient ( I take forever to make my mind). 3rd BEST breakfast burrito ever! I ordered the chipotle burrito and wow!"}
{"text":"Everything I have ordered is fresh, delicious & quickly prepared. My favorites include Melz Wrap, Z-Chick, and the freshly baked cookies."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place! They have the best breakfast burritos outside Colorado. The staff is awesome...always friendly and very helpful."}
{"text":"Nice, local café. 

Everything is very fresh. Quality grub at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Lived by this place for 2 years, had no clue what I was missing. I tried the bloom sandwich, and it was amazing. I had macaroni salad and potato salad (because the employee insisted that I try both), and he gave the extra side at no charge. 

Also, the service was excellent. Incredibly nice people there! Well deff go back!"}
{"text":"Z's is soo good! Fresh, healthy, and delicious! 

Gabster is my fav. Their ranch is great and I love the homemade crouton/chip thingies."}
{"text":"Always feeling great after eating here. Light food. I enjoy their potato salad. My other favorite is just a simple ham sandwich with lettuce tomato mayo mustard :)"}
{"text":"Z Cafe is awesome! Their breakfast burritos are worth the drive from anywhere! The sandwiches and salads are fresh and delicious! A must visit!"}
{"text":"Delicious! You pay for quality, and that's what you get here. I got the Dylan without bacon, and the chef himself Dylan made it for me. It tasted great, this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"I am a vegan, at least today I was,  and I wanted something warm,  so they make a wrap for me.  The ingredients were fresh and delicious.  Had there home made humus on the sandwich.........I will be back.......maybe next time for breakfast.  Yummy"}
{"text":"Love this little place. We have ordered takeout lunch here multiple times. Everything we've tried is good, and I LOVE that you can customize orders online and they actually pay attention to the order details! Also ordered a breakfast burrito today, and it was huge and amazing! The variety on the menu is fantastic, the potato salad as a side is bomb, and I will always love any place that gives free pickle spears, lol"}
{"text":"easily the greatest breakfast burritos ever  ! we order them so often at our workplace that they made a special button on the cash register, soooo you could also try a lone star racing burrito too , they may be surprised you requested off the menu lol.the service is always great and the ladies that take our phone orders are really polite and courteous. we order sandwiches at lunchtime if we miss the breakfast cut off and are always super happy with the food. highly recommended"}
{"text":"Anytime I'm craving a sandwich, I come here. Always delicious and friendly staff to help you through your order. The Alloush is my favorite!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I reallllly liked the breakfast burritos.  We got them to go.  I got the egg white and chicken one and he got extra bacon, egg, and cheese.  The flavor was delicious and the tortillas they used were yummy.  My only complaint was the amount of water at the bottom of my container, although I don't know that it really could have been helped much.  Will definitely go back here!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! This is some fresh food. I am floored at how delicious this place is. Their sourdough is to die for!"}
{"text":"Hubs was down with pneumonia in a motel room (Kill. Me. Now) and sent me out for organic orange juice and a bagel. In Arizona. He may as well have sent me out for  a needle in a haystack. Arizona isn't as into the bagel scene as Portland.

Made it to Dunkin Donuts, which I understand now carries all kinds of bagels (who knew?) But they were OUT of OJ!! I backed out of the drive through, and looked to my Yelp oracle for guidance....

Once again, Yelp did not disappoint. It sent me to Z-Cafe.... a great concept cafe.... nothing but a counter fridge, and expresso machine, a juicer and 3 hot plates.... but they turn out some seriously good and fresh food. I got fresh squeezed orange juice and a bagel with cream cheese, but I saw some yummy omelets being made.....will stop by on my next visit to Mesa."}
{"text":"Yum! Amazing sandwiches! Try the turkey bacon avocado or the godfather :) always friendly service and great for lunch. I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches!  Excellent breads! 

Avocado BLT on whole grain rocks my world!"}
{"text":"I ordered the half salad and sandwich combo. I got the Mediterranean and the avocado bacon sandwich. The salad was stellar, they were generous with their toppings and the balsamic was just right. The sandwich was also good, my only critique was that my bacon was in smaller pieces, I don't want to say crumbles but they were a little bigger. I think it would have been a little easier to eat with bigger slices. Still good though, the 9 grain bread was fresh tasting and the focaccia strips were a nice touch."}
{"text":"The only reason why I keep going to see café is because their sandwiches are very good. They have an arrangement of breads and different types of sandwiches as well as excellent sides. But otherwise when it comes to some of the employees I am disappointed. For a small business you would think you would see many smiling faces and great customer service. But every time that I come in to café it has not been a pleasant experience. Most of the problem is with the ladies at take the order. Most are unwilling to work with you or give you dirty looks. I was trying to give this girl change so I wouldn't get back more change and she wasn't willing to work with me because she \"didn't know how to do it \". And both times that I've gotten my food to go whenever I get it back home it's a mess. Usually my potato salad is smeared all over my sandwich. I think they need to start putting it in a separate container so that it doesn't get everywhere. And if I get a coffee from them it takes pretty much forever to get it. I will keep going to this place because their food is good but I don't plan on making conversation anymore."}
{"text":"I usually order a croissant egg and cheese sandwich when I come in here, it is always on point the bread is never dry or burnt, And they have the best homemade chocolate chip cookies!! Way better than pot belly/s cookies"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how delicious their sandwiches are here.  They have the best reuben sandwich I've ever had.  I've had the potato breakfast burrito and the club sandwich, and those were both excellent as well.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place was busy and a bit loud but tolerable.  I am glad I ordered right off the YELP site as it was quick and easy to order off of and it was certainly done a lot sooner than YELP had predicted.  Awesome food.  My caesars salad could have had a bit more chicken but it was definitely worth it but order two dressings as there is more salad than chicken."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating at Z Cafe. I ordered the turkey bacon and avocado on sourdough with a side of fresh fruit. My husband ordered the roast beef melt on sourdough with their  potato salad. I was just as impressed with this visit as my last. Both sandwiches tasted fresh and delicious. The sides were equally tasty. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy food! Great cafe place for a nice sandwich. Easy to order and pick up. The alloush sandwich is my favorite. This is a great family owned sandwich shop"}
{"text":"This place consistently rocks. 

I love their Breakfast burritos and recommend all of them. The Veggie burrito is probably my most-ordered. But I also get the Ziti, Southwest and Chipotle Burrito often as well

At lunch, I totally recommend the Alloush and the Godfather.
All of their sides are delicious, too. I usually like to get the bowtie pasta. But their homemade potato salad is delicious as it is the macaroni salad. 

Be sure to ask what soup they have that day and also what the fruit of the day is because both change.

They have delicious Kona coffee available, too."}
{"text":"Z Cafe has quickly become a local favorite. They have delicious gluten free bread/sandwiches, which is a big reason I love it! The Alloush is my go to sand which with potato salad. They even have gf cookies! 

It's a popular lunch spot for locals, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I don't know what everyone is raving about.  I got the Godfather at the suggestion of everyone else.  It was very average.  Greasy, too much mayo.  Wasn't bad, but I wouldn't get it again.  Only good things were the pickle and potato salad.  Staff was friendly, but 5 stars?  Get a grip Mesa."}
{"text":"Ive been a customer of Z Cafe for about six years. Almost two years ago I moved to New Orleans. Im here visiting AZ for a bit and I have been going regularly. The food was already excellent, my favorites are the Godfather and the breakfast burritos. However, Dan has added the best breakfast burrito he has ever made, actually there are two, the Chipotle and the Spicy. The combination of flavors is simply amazing. I have never ever had an average meal here, always A plus. Im so proud to support this place, they deserve the best because they serve the best food. Go there folks."}
{"text":"All I gotta say is get the Dylan on ciabatta. That is the best sandwich in town...and you can bank on that!!"}
{"text":"Wow? Just found a great little gem of a cafe. Was looking on Yelp for a breakfast place and found z-cafe. Staff extremely pleasant. I ordered a custom scramble. Came out quickly and hot and it was delicious!  Fresh ingredients for sure. 

I'll be back to try more menu items. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are the shiz.  We eat here as a treat when we have time whilst working from home together.  Southwest  is our usual. Salsa IS hot."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here it is excellent. Sandwiches are awesome, just had the southwest burrito. As a Mexican I approve the burritos."}
{"text":"If we want cute little local places like this to stick around, WE MUST SUPPORT THEM! This was my first time at the Z-cafe. New to the area because of work and this little spot has been on my radar for a couple months thanks to Yelp! and it's stellar reviews. This is why I love Yelp! so much. I would have never known this place was here without it. Long story short: I had lunch there today. I ordered The Godfather on sourdough and the rest is history. If you're looking for a delicious, well-proportioned lunch; this is your place. They have anything from hot or cold sandwiches, to wraps and burritos, to smoothies and espresso. Take a break from the corporate chain hotspots and check this place out! I'm sure glad I did."}
{"text":"Great food! Breakfast is awesome.  Went on a Saturday and service was fast and friendly"}
{"text":"I had a turkey, bacon, and avocado sandwich on sourdough. There was a bit too much chipotle mayo on my sandwich, but I was able to scrape most of it off. The canteloupe on the side was a bit underripe, but overall it was a great lunch and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Found this place a few years ago and will go there any chance I get.  Have turned many of my co-workers onto this place and they agree the food is so good.  The people are all so nice and friendly the place is super clean.  I have gone there many times that one of the ladies doesn't even have to ask my name.  I will tell anyone that I get a chance to tell about this place."}
{"text":"By far one of the best place I have been to crossiant  sandwich  with turkey provolone  cheese  and Avacado and potato  salad Amazing  people are welcoming and prizes are great"}
{"text":"The owner is super nice and the environment is friendly. I got the Dylan is what it is called. Green chillies chicken bacon chipotle dressing. It came as a wrap. It is extremely delicious. I just feel the serving size was a little small. The potato salad was good. The cost was about 8 bucks for everything. From this one sandwich I wouldn't label it as the end all sandwich shop."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast and lunch spot.  Customized omelets, so much of heir lunch food, and their amazing iced tea have kept me a loyal customer since 2009.  They even make great latés, cold brew coffee, and smoothies."}
{"text":"Ordered Ruben with potato salad side, medium drink, all told about $10. Meal was very good. Nice atmosphere in strip shopping center. Seems like ample seating. Recommend give this place a try."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! I always crave their sandwiches! Z-Cafe is close to my husbands work and he visits at least once a week. They have tons of different sandwich options and I love that they will make your sandwich on any bread of your choosing. They're pasta salad is really good! You can't beat a great Mom and pop sandwich shop like Z-Cafe!"}
{"text":"Two words: THE MADDIE. This grilled cheese is everything. I'm pretty much a connoisseur of cheese sandwiches and I can tell you that Z Cafe's rendition is a winner lol. I come here regularly for lunch since my job is close and they're always well staffed at this time which makes the process of ordering and picking up very smooth. Their treats like the cookies are soooooo good, as close to fresh baked as you can get at mid afternoon during the work week. Great place to eat lunch, I just wish they'd stay open later...BLT is good also."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. Based on reviews, ordered The Godfather. Sandwich was super fresh, although a little more oily that I'd like! Next time I'd order the Italian dressing on the side! I also had the mayo on the side and it really didn't need it. Potato salad was AMAZING!!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The best Ruben you will ever have in your life. The company I work for gets food delivered here once in a while and I have had the Reuben roughly 934 times and each time it has been glorious. I bet this is a recipe from the Reuben Lords themselves. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"The food was fresh and the service was quick. My small salad was large and fresh. The ciabatta sandwich was also fresh and tasty. I will be back."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this cute little cafe in Mesa while looking for a place to eat a quick lunch. I was pleasantly surprised at how busy it was, and how great the food is. The service was amazing as well! I got the Southwest Salad and it's delicious. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Everything tasted so fresh. It wasn't until I had already ordered that I say they were about to close in 5 minutes, but the staff were so gracious about it."}
{"text":"Delicious sammich. I had the godfather on sourdough. Very good! I would have rated them higher but they cut my sammich in half without asking."}
{"text":"Good Morning Yelpers ! 
This is my second time coming to Z's Cafe and I'm even more impressed the second time around all I can say is their food is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The flavors and menu options are well put together and perfectly executed, I couldn't ask for more. 
Here's a picture of \"The Bloom\" sandwich 


Thank you Z's Cafe"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place! Everything I've had here is great from breakfast burritos to hummus/veggie sandwiches. I would definitely recommend this place. There whole grade bread is also amazing and they also have gluten-free options. Sorry I don't have any pics, I will post them next time I go in, because I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I literally live right next to this place and never gave it much notice but I really wish I knew about this place much sooner! It's phenomenal all around. Best chai I've had in a long time and the very berry smoothie is so delicious! I also ordered the veggie burrito and I wasn't expecting it to be so large. It was very tasty and came in a spinach wrap! The staff was all so nice and quick. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Always great service and fantastic food. It's quick enough to pick up for lunch during the work week, but also nice inside to sit down and eat if you have time."}
{"text":"I'm really behind on writing reviews because I ate here a month ago and never got around to writing my review but Z-Café was great! I was more than pleasantly surprised at how good my sandwich was. My husband took me to lunch and I had found this little place on Yelp and I was so glad we came here. Our food was so fresh and for about the same prices as you'd see at Panera Bread, I'd pick Z-Café over Panera in a heartbeat. We ordered the Italian roast beef and BLT with bow tie pasta and potato salad as our sides. I used to work at a deli back in New York a few years ago which was fantastic and their side salads are seriously on par with NY delis which is SUPER HARD to find in Arizona. They have a few tables outside so you can enjoy your meal in this ridiculous Arizona heat but thankfully, the day we went here, it was beautiful outside. Customer service was great and the woman who took our order and brought our food out to us was so friendly. This place was also super close to my old job on Dobson and Guadalupe so if you're ever in the area and looking for a place to have a nice lunch that won't leave you feeling bloated and tired afterward, definitely give them a chance. Also, I have a terrible habit of checking in on Yelp after I order my food, don't do that, lol. This place has a check-in offer for a free medium drink."}
{"text":"Best lunch in Mesa! It's a must try! Owners are so nice. Big fan of all of the entire menu!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a foodie, and this place never disappoints!!! I love the amazing sandwiches, so fresh... and great quality boars head meat! Everything is homemade, made to order, and made right infront of you. I always get the Gabster, no cream cheese, and add turkey on 9-grain... to die for! I still need to try the Breakfast Burritos. They have awesome Iced Tea also. Not to mention, they also deliver!!!"}
{"text":"Gluten free bread. Will make lunch sandwiches for breakfast! Creative menu. 

Went here when Ike's love and sandwiches was closed."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food!
The best grilled cheese sandwich ever....ask for the Maddie's Grilled Cheese.

If breakfast is your thing, best breakfast burritos in town!  And their new item is Cinnamon rolls..... to die for!"}
{"text":"Excellent, high quality food, using only Boar's Head meats. The service is friendly. Be ready to wait a few minutes more than you would expect, but the food is served perfectly, and everything I've had is absolutely delicious and extremely fresh. One of my favorite new sandwich and soup places."}
{"text":"One of the best Breakfast places to eat in Mesa Arizona.  I can't even describe how delightful the burritos are  ,but it is the SALSA that is the absolute truth!"}
