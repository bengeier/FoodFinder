{"text":"As for these bad reviews I am not sure what your talking about I have heard such great things about this place and tried it and have actually had it 6 more times. ... my roomates and I love it... honestly hands down best pizza in calgary !!! People should definitely go to lorenzos...awsome pricing high quality product and an amazing end result !! Yum yum .. guess some restaurants just cant please everyone first time ive ever heard the negative side of lorenzos that's too bad for the bad reviews"}
{"text":"I have not found a great pizza place in Charlotte until now. This pizza is authentic, it's real \"New York\" pizza. I used to work at a specialized pizza place in college (SU), and using the best cheese that yields lots of oil and really good dough, make the pizza. 
Plus the owner is a Jets fan. Nice...
Recommendation: it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"I called one day after searching through other reviews, wanting two small pizzas at about 3:00 on Sat afternoon. Luissa's and Riccio's were both not open until 5:00, so the preferred places were not available. I ordered a 10\" plain cheese pizza and one with ham and mushrooms. The guy on the phone kept pushing the gluten free, which I agreed to, not knowing it was more expensive, (coulda told me that, huh?), and the \"receipt\" I got didn't have name or price listed on it when I got home and looked. A PLAIN cheese and one with ham and mushrooms, both TEN INCH pizzas, totaled over thirty dollars at the register. Just use a gun and stick me up, if robbery is your motive. $15.00 for a plain 10\" pizza ??? First and last opportunity to rip me off. I'll NEVER go back."}
{"text":"First time I got their pizza - plain margarita it was delicious and I told people to try this place!! And the benefit for me its so close. I have since tried it (twice!!!) since then and both times the pizza was inedible, so soggy and a total waste of money! Both occasions I ordered a large as had friends over and it was very disappointing. I don't know if it was way too much sauce and cheese for the thin base but won't be ordering again considering the amount of restaurants you can order and pick up from around 17th!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place is still open , we tried this place for the first time tonight. There were three of us and this was a Friday evening. But was not crowded at all. My daughter ordered the pasta Alfredo, I ordered the meat lovers Pizza, my wife ordered the eggplant entree. My daughter first got her Alfredo meal and at the same time my wife got her side for her meal. My pizza did not come out, my daughter tried  the pasta Alfredo and said that she did not like it, then my wife tried it, she did not like it, and I tried it and did not like it. It tasted like milk and flour mixed together horrible sauce. My wife  tried her pasta even though she was still waiting for her main dish which the waiter kept saying it will come out soon which it never did. She said the ingredients seem to be a very very low quality, and tasted as such, like something out of a can. No wonder why you have to pay for your food up front before even receiving it because it's horrible.

This was our Friday and we wanted a nice meal as a family not watching each other eat while waiting on food.

 After realizing the horrible taste of the pasta Alfredo, and the horrible taste of her spaghetti with tomato sauce, and the low quality of ingredients, and very bad cooking skills, also considering the fact that the food is actually very expensive for what you get, we realized it's probably better just to ask for our money back and leave. We never got the pizza and eggplant meal. The waiter said he needed to call somebody first before giving our money back, turned out this was the owner who he was talking to on the phone. The owner told him not to give any money back. I could not believe this, in America you get your money back if you didn't get what you pay for. His argument was that the food was cooked and therefore we needed to pay for it regardless if it tasted like garbage the fact that they made an effort to cook the food is what we have to pay him for. I had to make a very big scene to finally get my money back. The owner is a slime bag that's operating a very low quality Pizzeria with no ethics and no morals.  There seemed to be people that were regulars there, but I really do think there's a lot of people that will stay at a place just cuz it's close by and the pizza could taste like cardboard and they will  still come back.  

Again I just want to emphasize that the owner is a real real piece of trash and tried to slime some money away from customers hoping that we weren't the type of people to fight for their money back.

I really believe a lot of their 5 Star reviews are from their staff that work at the place.

We will never go back there, and we will definitely recommend to everyone that we ever meet not to go there if asked for recommendations on places to eat, we live nearby."}
{"text":"Went here because of the other reviews I saw but when I got there it wasn't busy at all and I had to wait 45 minutes for a large pizza and wings. Wings were okay but we're missing a lot of sauce and the \"Canadian\" pizza was pretty good.
Would recommend calling in before."}
{"text":"We went to Lorenzo's in the hopes of great pizza and we were not disappointed! The pizza was delicious, with a nice 'in between' crust, not too thin or too thick and doughy. The pizza sauce was good and even though we stuck with a basic pizza (Quattro formaggio) it was tasty. Since we stayed there to eat the pizza was piping hot, and the cheese still nice and melty. Minus one star for the condition of the washroom."}
{"text":"I have spent the last 6 years taste testing 47 pizzerias in Calgary and Lorenzo's Pizza is now in my top five. They use a very high end wood burning oven that produces an evenly cooked pizza that's crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, top quality mozzarella, savory sauce and quality ingredients. Surprisingly they're cheaper than most places. This little gem is definitely worth the trip, I can't believe there aren't more rave reviews for this place. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"i'm from the Northeast (lived in NJ, NYC and CT) and this is the best NY pizza I have found in Charlotte. salads are good too. However the eggplant roll is my favorite thing to get here. 

I'm a little confused at their delivery situation. Called one time on a Saturday and they said they only deliver on weekdays but since they weren't too busy they could probably get to us before 5pm. huh?"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I used to work in the area near Ardrey Kell Road a couple of years ago. We decided to take a little trip back down there and were pleasantly surprised to see how much it has built up. 

My girl was jonesing for Riccio's but it was Sunday and they don't open until 5pm. So we just happened to pass Lorenzo's and decided to give it a shot. We had never heard of the place but were pleased to see their menu boasting that they were voted Best NY Style Pizza in South Charlotte by the Charlotte Observer. 

We both went with some pepperoni pizza by the slice. I got two slices and my girl got one. This is actually an important detail. It took a bit for the slices to come out but they were piping hot so we were cool with it. The first thing that caught our attention was the crispiness of the crust. It was pretty much perfect in our book. The cheese and sauce were also good. Oddly enough, the pepperoni even made an impact. Most places the pepperoni just doesn't taste as fresh as it did here. 

It was so good that my girlfriend went back up to the counter and ordered a second slice which she made a valiant effort to finish but came up just short. The slices aren't as big as a Luigi's but are on par with Fuel. 

The only negative to us was the dining room was a little cramped but they had plenty of outdoor seating available. While we were there, some folks came in after church and were complaining about the price. They must not have gotten the memo they weren't at CiCi's. An 18\" pie is $15 with each add'l topping being an extra $2. They have a Mon-Thurs lunch special with your choice of pasta w/ one main entree and garlic knots for $6.95 which I'd be all over if I still worked in this area.

We were so impressed that we will probably be going back this weekend. I'd try something else but that pizza was so good that I have to get it again."}
{"text":"Ordered a half and half pizza of Zeus Greek and Sergio pizza. It's a cute pizza sit in or take out or delivery. Small place with 4 6 seater tables. What was a special touch was that the delivery guy who work there came by our table and set it with our dinner plate and cutlery, it was nice to see this happen when you just imagine a delivery guy in a car with pizza. So when the pizza came it was great in appearance the toppings were amazing and just the right amount on it. The pizza dough was thin but not thin because the toppings were amazing more covering the pizza than some other places were you look for the toppings and you can count the pieces. This would be a place to come back to in Oak Ridge. The meat on the Sergio had alot of meat on it and the bacon was crispy on top. And the service was very good and time for wait was decently good too!"}
{"text":"I love the food here and eat it WAY too much. I usually get ham, pineapple and green peppers but last night had a deluxe calzone with a side of tomato sauce we also got an order of meatballs and everything was crazily good and we were stuffed. The tomato sauce and garlic sauce are my favourite so order a side, its worth it. Also there are a ton of leftovers, you will get 2+ more meals out of it. I am 100% loyal to Lorenzo's for my stuff my face delivery food needs!"}
{"text":"I went here on a friend's recommendation looking for a good Sicilian pizza. I was sadly disappointed. I am picky when it comes to pizza being a native New Yorker.
The crust was not crisp and probably under-cooked. The sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce without much flavor and the sausage & peppers that I ordered for toppings were skimpy and scarce. I don't mind paying $25.00 for a good Sicilian pie but this wasn't worth it at any price. If you a looking for a good Sicilian pie, look elsewhere!!"}
{"text":"I tried the pizza here & didn't care for it.  That's common depending on whether you prefer sweet or acidic red sauce.

Next time I tried the chicken roll.  Let me tell you this was the worst chicken roll I have ever had.  There was NO chicken & the mozzarella wasn't even cooked.  There is nothing worse that half-cooked mozzarella."}
{"text":"Long story short, I ordered a prosciutto pizza off Skip the Dishes and it arrived fairly burnt. I called the restaurant to let them know. At the time they were really good about it and promised me a credit towards another large pizza. 

Fast forward to tonight, I called in to use the credit and Mike, who I think is the owner, said he couldn't find a record of the credit. He said they hired some new employees and that they move stuff around and maybe that was why he couldn't find the slip. To me it simply felt like he didn't want to provide the credit. In short, he said he couldn't honour the credit without a record because people often try to scam them for free food.

That's totally understandable but I had the previous order number from Skip the Dishes. Not to mention, he acknowledged that his staff often lose the slips. I gave him the order number over the phone and he rather colourfully replied that I should go *expletive* myself and hung up. I actually had a picture too but you can't really show that over the phone. I attached it below to the review.

The guy was probably having a bad day or something but I can't recommend a place that swears at customers and hangs up on them. Especially, when I still had the receipt. To be fair, the times I've ordered pizza before it has always been pretty good but I agree with other people that the delivery time can be quite long.

An okay late night option but if customer service is important to you there are other great options in the area like Niko's or Pizzeria Gaga."}
{"text":"I am thankful to Lorenzo's for being open late on the thanksgiving holiday. After finding my \"go to \"place was closed, I saw the glowing reviews of Lorenzo's and called them up for pick up. The young man who answered the phone was very pleasant when I asked him about his menu. We settled on an extra large BBQ Balsamic Chicken pizza. The guy who helped me over the phone opened up the box to let us inspect the pie when we came to pick up our order. 
The thing was massive! He assured me we'd have enough for lunch the next day, and he was right. Two pieces of the Chicken Balsamic and I was defeated. The slices had lots of toppings and the balsamic shone through, not being over powered by the BBQ sauce. Roasted red peppers were a nice touch that was a little unexpected as well. Definitely would go back to try some of the other choices on the menu."}
{"text":"Efficient and well run.  They move people in and out quickly.  But the pizza is nothing to write home about.  It's OK NY style pizza.  Those raving about it have clearly missed better places in Charlotte.  Luigis stands along.  Please like Librettos are a clear step above.  Even Brooklyn Pizza is a bit better than this place.  They deliver but a 16\" pie with pepperoni is gonna run you $20 plus tip. Not an outstanding deal.  They only deliver weekdays."}
{"text":"So this review is pretty much all about the Grandma's Pie but first off I will add that I've had several of their individual slices as well as the Chicken Parm Hero and a Calzone.  All of which are decent but ultimately forgettable, unlike the Grandma's Pie.  Customer Service can be spotty, I've been ignored completely at lunch time and walked out twice.  But then the majority of the time I find the workers to be very friendly so it's a bit of a hit or miss head scratcher.  

Now onto the Grandmas Pie...I like Margerita style pizzas but this is on a completely different level.  The crust has a cracker like crisp to the outer layer but is slightly chewy inside which I love.  You get the best of both worlds as far as I'm concerned as I love ALL types of pizza and crusts.  The cheese gets melted right onto the dough and gets dollops of their very flavorful homemade sauce baked right onto the top.  The basil leaves are normally very fresh and aromatic and for the grand finale, the freshly minced garlic puts an exclamation point onto this savory pizza pie, my favorite in Charlotte.  The Grandmas Pie is every bit of 5 stars but overall I had to rate Lorenzo's at a 4 because I've yet to have anything else there that has left such an impression.  Helpful tip for those who live more than 5 or 10 mins away...ask them to do a partial bake so you can finish it off at home in your own oven, nothing beats this pizza fresh out of the oven and they're happy to oblige."}
{"text":"Just average and uninspiring.  When Palone's first opened, under original ownership, their pizza blew Lorenzo's away. Sadly the last owners ran Palone's into tge ground leaving Lorenzo's as the closest non-chain pizza place. My kids prefer Domino's and I tend to agree."}
{"text":"Having moved to Charlotte about 2 years ago from NY, it has been a struggle to find really good pizza.  There are many serviceable options, but no stand-outs.  Lorenzos is truly authentic NY pizza.  The place is clean, bright and open and the staff is attentive and friendly.  The place gets mobbed on weekend nights, but I think that it's worth the wait.  They have a nice thin crust as well as a sicilian (thick, rectangular) option.  The toppings are fresh and tasty.  Lorenzos gets my highest rating."}
{"text":"Love their White Pizza! And the lasagna pizza is really good too. It keeps us coming back for more."}
{"text":"Our family has eaten Lorenzo's pizza since they opened. It's without a doubt the best pizza in Charlotte!! We live in Gastonia now, and I often drive an hour plus to bring home their pepperoni pizza or their Grandma's Pie. I HIGHLY recommend ordering a large pepperoni!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner after church. The pizza out fast. It was that gooey slightly greasy pizza that you know is going to be awesome and it was!!!
You know that a pizza is good when your seven and three year old start eating and don't stop until their piece is done!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here while visting my sister. The pizza was def NY style! Seating is a bit tough to get w/ a large group during the summer though cuz it's so hot outside and inside has limited seating."}
{"text":"Hands down the best NY pizza in Charlotte. Brooklyn Pizza is a close 2nd but this place takes the prize for this 25 year transplanted ex-New Yorker. Lorenzo's is old school pizzeria. The family used to have a place on Knapp St."}
{"text":"I like this place.
The pizza is very good, sometimes the Sicilian pizza is not great but you can't do much better in Charlotte for Sicilian pizza.
Parking is terrible"}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten here and have gotten take out several times over the past few years. Unfortunately, Friday's visit will probably be our last. The staff seems to do their best to keep the \"rude\" stigma of NY alive in the south. The young man who took our order made us feel like we were putting him out to have to deal with us. There was no pen at his register to sign the credit card document, so after a big huff he walked over to the other register to get a pen. Rather than walking it back, he tosses it onto the counter at us!  Seriously?  Maybe he was having a bad day, but this wasn't me he first visit where we were treated with horrible customer service. 

We ordered three pepperoni slices, garlic knots, French fries, and a Caesar salad. I couldn't believe that the slices came out dripping in grease. These were cheese slices that they threw some pepperoni in and slid in the oven. I think we used about three napkins per slice. Then there was the salad, which tasted like a bag salad from Harris Teeter!  The highlight of our meal were the garlic knots. These were awesome and the marinara was delicious. The fries were nice and hot and crispy."}
{"text":"When I first came down to Charlotte, I was looking for some good pizza, that I could compare to all the one's located on Long Island. Lorenzo's at first I wasn't sure about, but after having there regular and sicilian slices, i was hooked. Whoever says it's all in the water, is a fool. These guys figured it out. And there one of a few shops here that you can walk in and ask for a slice. Everywhere else, it's like asking a dumb question to get one slice ordered. Fuhghettabouit..Lorenzo rules."}
{"text":"This is second time Lorenzos has catered food for the soccer team.. Everyone enjoyed the food and Steve was willing to workout a price based on my team budget. Good job all around.
Will use them whenever in town."}
{"text":"Some of the best delivery pizza I've every had. Great ingredients, awesome crust. Just wish delivery was a littler faster. Next time I'm in Calgary, I'll be ordering for sure."}
{"text":"Nothing has changed here in 10 years 
Order penne alla vodka that was mushy and came with burnt garlic knots 
Last time I ever go there"}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience with this restaurant a couple of years ago. I have not been there since then so don't know if there is still the case.

When I first visited Charlotte, my family lived in a hotel. We went out to find some feed to order to go. the waiting was not too bad. We took the pizza back to hotel and ate them. My two kids for whatever reason did not want to eat the meatball. they only ate the crust. My wife ate a little bit. I was the one who ate all the meat balls.  After a couple of hours, my wife got a bad stomach and had to go restroom several times before sleep. I was ok until after mid night. I went to restroom almost every 20~30 minutes. Till second day morning, I was dehydrated and have no energy left. I never had such experience with food.  I am pretty sure there was something wrong with the meat. fortunately, my kids did not eat the meatball.  

I feel like I am obliged to share my bad experience here. did not get a chance to do this until today. hopefully they improved their hygiene and does not such bad food any more."}
{"text":"Lorenzo's used to be our go to place for late night pizza but it has become overpriced with small portions and the quality of the toppings is definitely mediocre at best. Skip this place and find something better to satisfy your late night pizza cravings."}
{"text":"I have 1 favorite eat in Charlotte and his is IT!!!!! Firstly they will likely be busy so be patient! They are family owned by very kind people, with excellent service! There are many young people who work there who have been there for years who are amazing by the way. They have a great heated outdoor patio great for large parties and big groups and outdoors peeps like me. Of course the pizza is hands down the BEST pizza I have ever eaten. (Trust me when I say I am the Garfield of pizza) :) it's the best texture and the best cheese in the world it is no ordinary pizza, also did I mention a slice is umm about the size of your head or bigger. (Happy dance) Though I am a southerner, it is what I expect New York pizza to taste like, and it is always consistent. Last but certainly not least, you must get ice cream after. Hershey's brand ice cream GOOD gosh my life is always complete after. I recomend the lasagne pie and mint chocolate chip ice cream that is all."}
{"text":"We decided to stop by and try the pizza here it is a good more of a traditional n.y style thin and greasy in a good way very cheesy and a pizza is almost 25. Dollars but its big ... 

Only thing we weren't that impressed with was the salad but the pizza is good I'll give it a 3"}
{"text":"The BEST sauce.  I love chicken Parmesan and have had it many times over the years.  This is my absolute favorite place to get it.  The pizza is amazing too."}
{"text":"I'm from NY, and this is the best pizza place I've had down here yet!  The mozzarella sticks are delicious and so is the sauce that comes with them.  My husband and I ordered a Grandma Pie--it was so good!  The sauce/cheese/basil ratio was perfect.  The crust was thin and crispy-not greasy at all.  I want to try some of their other dishes next time as I'm sure those will be great too."}
{"text":"Pizza came out hot & crispy tonight.  Service was good, the young staff seems happy to be working there by making small talk and always coming by to see if all was good."}
{"text":"Not yummy I repeat not yummy ...the pizza was really bad the topping where really bad,....did you take a look in the back???"}
{"text":"The pizza is good (could use more sauce IMO) but doubt we'll order from them again as we waited an hour and 45 minutes for pizza to be delivered tonight. Because it was a busy Friday night, the girl said to expect pizza 45 min - 1 hr... Had we known it would be twice that long, we would've cancelled our order.  A discount should've been offered but was not."}
{"text":"Best pizza, gelato, ice cream, and other Italian favorites. They remember you by name if you've been there more than 2-3 times! Just like the Italian food in NY and both my husband and I are from the North East (NY little Italy and Boston North End) so we are harsh critics!"}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza place around! We've tried all the \"authentic Ny style\" pizza places in ballantyne (Tonys, librettos, etc) but Lorenzo's is always the very best. The sauce is mild and fresh tasting, nice chewy crust and lots of good quality cheese. The pizza is almost always what we get but we've had a few pasta dishes there that were good too- one was a lemon chicken pasta I think?
Regardless give it a try! A little Pricey but worth it when you want \"the good stuff\" :-)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in all of Calgary. Lorenzo's looks underwhelming from out front, but the food is top-notch. Pizzas are a bit pricey, but HUGE so it's worth it. They come overloaded with toppings, so prepare your appetites and your napkins. The Balsamic BBQ Chicken is one of my faves, but I'm slowly working my way through the rest of the menu. Staff is super friendly and provide great customer service, but pizzas typically take 25+ mins to make, so don't call if you expect food right away. This is the perfect stop if you're looking for very traditional delicious take-out pizza, and an essential for Sunday football!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Charlotte area.  Having lived in both NY and NJ, I've been looking for a place that reminded me of good NY-region pizzerias - Lorenzo's is that place.  Just the right amount of (good, not the overly sweet sauce the chains use) sauce, cheese, and the crust is perfectly crisp.  There's a large outdoor covered patio which is great for getting some fresh air while getting my lunch at Lorenzo's.

They also just opened up an ice cream store next door (Stephen's Scoops) - Haven't tried it yet, but just the fact that they list an Egg Cream on their menu is reason enough for me to grab one with my pizza next time, and think I'm back in NY."}
{"text":"When I think of Lorenzo's Pizza, my first thought is automatically The Van B boys episode on Seinfeld. I've passed by this place countless numbers of times when I lived in Ballantyne but never thought of anything about it. When one of my friends who is from NY told me good things about it, I knew I had to make a special trip there to see what it's all about. I stopped by this afternoon around noon and the place was bumping! Noon in Ballantyne usually doesn't equate to bumping in my book but once I saw that many people there, I knew I made a good decision. They sell their pizza by the slice along with whole pies and had a wide variety of toppings for the slices like sausage, pepperoni, spinach with a white sauce and Sicilian! It's been years since I've enjoyed Sicilian pizza and didn't anything too heavy but bookmarked it for future eats. I got a slice of pepperoni and it was absolutely fantastic. The sauce woke up my taste buds, the grease sank into my mouth and it was gone in less than three minutes (folded up of course). 

They have a huge menu with standard Italian fare like calzones, homemade rolls, pasta, chicken entrees and a nice selection of desserts like cannolis, black and white cookies and Italian cookie baskets. They offer lunch specials Mon-Thurs too which looked like a good deal for under $7. Employees were super friendly and it felt like it was a neighborhood joint where they would remember you. Even though I live near Uptown, I will definitely be making another trip to Lorenzo's to try their other items. The question is though-To Sicilian or not Sicilian? I say it's going to be to!"}
{"text":"one of our favorite places!! the food is SO good. authentic Italian."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious, the service was friendly and the kitchen was quick. Everything we asked for and while it wasn't as good as NYC, it was the next best thing. Family of 4 ate for 25 bucks. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"I have been to this place multiple times and it has never been very good. Last night was the last time we will ever go to this pizza place. We ordered 3 slices all with extra cheese. All 3 slices were cold and undercooked. We sent them back and they  still were only slightly warm. To be fair, the staff was very nice and tried to be helpful. They hardly put any extra cheese (see pic) on the slices. The total cost for 3 slices with two waters was over $15. 

What a rip off!  Pizza is always undercooked and too expensive. 

Will stick with Brooklyn pizza from now on."}
{"text":"Good NY style pizza. Crust was good, cheese and oil was perfect. Could have used a little more sauce on the pie.
Garlic knots were great, and so was the dipping sauce."}
{"text":"A great New York style pizza fix for the suburbs of Charlotte. Always consistent, and their plain cheese pizza is a favorite."}
{"text":"The only place in all of Charlotte that I can say is 100% NYC approved pizza. I can't speak too much about the food. It's most definitely below any NYC pizza parlor food. But it's not bad by any means. If you have not tried their pizza go! And if you are visiting and hate the \"local\" pizza well RUN."}
{"text":"The pizza is the best around....the service...well let's say they have a good enough product that they can be unfriendly and almost ***holes and I'll probably keep going every time I'm craving NY pizza.
Crust is authentic NY style, they use whole milk cheese which in my opinion is the only way to do pizza right and the sauce is what really sets Lorenzo's apart....not too sweet not to acidic...dead on. Sicilian slices are really good and toppings are good quality....all around best Pizza I've had in the Charlotte area.....BUT the service is absolute crap!
I've both eaten in and done take out and there's always an attitude no matter who helps you..walk up place you order with a guy who barely says hi...and then find an open table and wait for someone to literally drop a pizza on the table and leave....ask for parm, garlic or anything for that matter and you get a rolling of the eyes and maybe what you asked for. Takeout isn't any better....3 times I've walked in paid for my phone in order and watched the kid walk away and answer the phone or start cleaning something while I can see my pies sitting on top of the oven....eventually I had to flag someone else down to give me my pizza...which of course i get questioned if I paid .....they are lucky Charlotte doesn't really have anything that's close to they're product if not I'd never go..."}
{"text":"It's big time trouble that I live across the street from Lorenzo's... The food is completely amazing!  I've gone with several people from New York who claim this is as good as pizza back home.  It's always hot, fresh and excellent - I have never had a bad experience with the food.  Definitely isn't too hot for your waistline but it's all relative. 

I'm big on customer service, which is why they are only getting 4 stars from me.  Most of the time, I'm greeted by the owners saying a robust hello but am served by un-energetic staff. There isn't a lot of urgency or attentiveness to customers.  The food makes up for it but I would love to see this change made.  

Glad to have Lorenzo's as a neighborhood staple!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  We have eaten in and gotten food to go.  Very consistent. Love that they have by the slice so the kiddos do t have to complain about what I want on the pizza.  The meatball subs are fantastic and the beer is always nice and cold."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Good wings. Poor salads. A few bottled beers to choose from. A family friendly atmosphere but not super nice, a few small TVs, young friendly high school wait staff, nice owners. Slight advantage to Tony Sacco's but Lorenzo's is a close second in south Charlotte to get you jersey style pizza fix."}
{"text":"45 minutes for 2 slices of cheese pizza and 6 ct. garlic rolls. we knew they were busy.... but really?? understaffed much? finally decided to ask how much longer it should be and come to find out our order got lost. -_- The kid who we asked said \"oh... I don't know why they never made it\".

food was good though when we finally got it."}
{"text":"On my recent visit to Charlotte, my daughter and her husband treated me to one of my favorites, white pizza.  They had me order whatever I wanted to bring back to me and it was so good!

Ooey, gooey, garlicky.....can't wait to have this again!"}
{"text":"Great little gem. Pizza by the slice options. Most times you wait a couple minutes but the guy working there is awesome. Not much variety of options with slices but defiantly taste amazing and one slice for 5$ is perfect! You should give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Love this pizza & Italian joint, it's casual with great food & plenty of choices for the whole family!  Very reasonable pricing, lots of seating (some outdoor) and just a nice relaxed environment.  Pizza is GREAT and we also LOVE the lasagna!!"}
{"text":"This was a treat. Ordered late got it on time hot and delicious. Delivered to the room. Nice."}
{"text":"Ok, we decided to give Lorenzo's another try tonight and this time we were not disappointed! 

For this visit, we decided to try their entrees -  and we both went for the chicken parm. This is a big dish - I definitely got 2 meals out of it.  

The chicken was good, loaded with cheese and served with a nice fresh tomato sauce.  You can choose spaghetti or penne for the side which is also covered with the good tomato sauce.  They also served up some nice fresh bread.  

The folks working here are very friendly and provide good service. If you are looking for good solid food in a nice but casual environment, this is a great option!"}
{"text":"This is another one of our \"go-to\" places when missing home.  Nothing beats a NYC pizza but since we're not in NYC this is gonna have to do for now! It is a bit pricey for a pizza joint.  The pasta dishes I've ordered are good!  The penne alla vodka with grilled chicken or shrimp is a great comfort food on cold days.  I've also requested Veal Francese (special request) and its been delicious!"}
{"text":"Grandma's Pie is amazing.  Other faves:  the meatballs, chicken Parmesan, and even the garlic knots!   The cannoli are also very good (they are individually made to order).  Only downside: service is hit or miss."}
{"text":"As a born and bred New Yorker for 37 years before relocating to Charlotte 7 years ago this is by far the most authentic NY-style pizza you will find in Charlotte metro area.  Others claim it but most fall far short.  The sauce and cheese are top notch, the crust is as good as it gets and their meatball and chicken parm heroes are also hard to beat.

My family and have been regulars since its opening and have yet to be disappointed.  I have been to all the top pizza joints in the area plus many others throughout the Carolinas and would put Lorenzos up against any of them.  A great slice- that's what it is about!"}
{"text":"I called to deliver a pizza to my hotel . Man said that it will be here in an hour . Its been two hours now and i have not yet received anything . I called 40 minutes ago and worker said they are on the road . My hotel is literally one mile away from the pizza shop . And its still not here .  I dont even want it anymore ."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Grew up in Jersey and this joint is every bit as good as the best pizzerias I loved back home. Best pizza in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I've been west of Austin since 2007 and the only good pizza until Monday, 8 July 2013 was The Sausage Factory in San Francisco's Castro District, 517 Castro St, San Francisco, California 94114. That's a long drive from Calgary just to get a good pizza. But if you're in SF, this is the place to go for a good pizza. Hit the Hot Cookie if it is still there and don't forget In-N-Out Burger as well.

Okay, back from the now obvious food coma, I was at Yelp! event at the Endeavor Arts Gallery & Event Space for which Lorenzo's Pizzeria was there along with the Springbank Cheese Co, Jameson's, and Epiphanie Chocolate. The gathering was a fundraiser for Neighborhood Link.

I noticed there was free pizza and since I was sort of hungry, I though, eh, what the hell?

I got a slice of the Canadian I believe it was which had Pepperoni, Mushrooms and Bacon. The sauce was a perfect tangy mess. Such full rich tomato taste. The crust, perfectly cooked and not doughy at all. I thought I was in SF except for the spirit of Calgary in the air which brought me down to earth. When I returned, I realized now I could drive / walk about 2 km for a good pizza instead of 2100+ km.

So, leaving at 8:30pm from the event, we decided we wanted to get a full size pizza. Got the small round pizza (12 inch/30.5 cm) which is 2 for $24.95 with 3 toppings each. One with pepperoni, bacon, and onion and the other with pepperoni, olives, and something else. This took about 30 minutes but you could not ask for a better pizza this side of Austin or anywhere north of SF.

My previous pizza joint, Canadian Pizza Unlimited, is so hit or miss for quality that I had given up on pizza. Now, I have Lorenzo's which is closer to my residence, delivers late, and taste great but it is more filling.

This goes to show you that attending Yelp! events does pay off even if it's free for attendees and the business provide free goods. See you next week, Lorenzo's!"}
{"text":"This is the best Italian food in the area.  The Pizza tastes just like it does in Brooklyn,  NY.  The dishes are also incredible.   A must try to anyone in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Lorenzo's has the best pizza I have found since moving to Charlotte six months ago.....BY FAR!!!

The closet that I have found to N.Y.C. pizza.

Every other pizza I've has down here has been terrible. I like real pizza!

Lorenzo's rice balls are very good also.  I'll try an entree the next time I visit Lorenzo's.

The staff are also friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"When it comes to a good pie, I tend to be a snob about where I eat and for the last two years Lorenzo's Pizzeria has consistently been one of my family's favorite pie shops in Charlotte. I first noticed Lorenzo's on my way to Blakeney shopping center in Ballantyne so I pulled in and checked out the menu. I really didn't know what to order but after speaking with the attendant, I went with the Supreme pizza. I know, how original?  I've never had a NY pie in NY so I can't compare but and it was very good, not the best I've ever had but very good. So, good in fact that we have made this our official carry out pizza spot. When we call in, sometimes we will get spotty customer service so it also helps that you can place an order online. Voila!!

If you do decide to dine in then there is plenty of room inside and last time I checked they also have outdoor seating which was decent but not very intimate. The ambiance and decor of the Lorenzo's seems to be typical of a pizza spot, so not too much stood out to me there. The wait staff from our visits have always been prompt, gracious and attentive. On the few occasions where we've had issues, they were handled promptly and professionally. To close, if you live within 20 to 30 minutes of Lorenzo's then you should definitely check them out at least once, I think you will enjoy. As I said earlier, we've been customers here for two years and it is one of our favorites in Charlotte."}
{"text":"It's as close to Brooklyn New York pizza as you can get! Delicious! We here since July and have tried several places. This is good and our new go to!"}
{"text":"Pizza is ok, but everything else was awful.  We ordered meatballs that were not even warm on the inside; I totally understand these are made ahead of time but they were super tough instead of tender.  The chicken parmesan was revolting.  I think they cooked the chicken previously and reheated it somehow, and it was so thin it looked and tasted like chicken jerky.  There was almost no cheese melted on top, which hello, is the best part, and they obviously didn't put it in the broiler to get hot and bubbly (the little cheese there was not browned).  The entree for the price should come with salad or something, but it didn't, and is supposed to come with bread as per the menu, but that was forgotten from our order.

We've gone to Lorenzo's for years and years.  The pizza used to be the best in town.  I've been so disappointed in the quality lately (even the pizza had almost no sauce) that I think I'm done with this place now.  I used to drive almost an hour round trip to go here; there are just too many better choices now.

I will say the kids that serve/checkout have always been nice and polite.  I think they just need to regroup on the food quality."}
{"text":"Easily the best NY Pizza in Charlotte. From the Jets and Yankee's stuff on the walls to Pizza that is similar to what you would find in any of the 5 Boro's. The food is also fantastic.  My only complaint is you have to show up knowing what you want, order, pay then wait. I would prefer table service, but hey, you can't have everything!"}
{"text":"When you arrive they tell you to seat yourself, take a paper menu and come back to the host station to order. Once you order you get a number and they are to bring you your food. 

Once I put in my order my kids food came out within 5 minutes but i was still waiting on a sandwich. About 15 minutes later I see a woman walking around the restaurant with my sandwhih asking everyone if they ordered it. Guess she didn't bother to match up the ticket with the number on my table. She saw that my kids were done with their meal and my was very later but she didn't care. No one ever asked if we needed anything.  Very poor customer service. Also food was bland and tasted like it was prepared at a high school cafeteria."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, does not disappoint. This is a family run business that really know how to make pizza. Probably the best NY pizza in all of North Carolina! My new favorite food spot in Charlotte. Will definitely come again and again."}
{"text":"We really like their pizzas.  Toppings are great, lots of choices and the crusts are New York thin.  A very busy place for pizza and you can tell by the line of people picking up. Close to NY pizza, but not quite.  I would put Lorenzo's at #2 to Brooklyn Pizza.  That said, the pizza is their best item and is very good.

Trying their pasta dishes was a different story.  They were just flat.  Came across as simply pasta and marinara sauce, which it was, but flavor was lacking.  Is not the same sauce on pizza.  Although the owner said it is fresh plum tomatoes, alone with pasta my wife and I thought it rather flavorless, ugh.  After a recent chat with the owner we will give it another shot. 

Salads are just fine and go well with the  pizza.  The have a number of beers available although no drafts.  And beer goes well with their pizzas.

Nice people who are busy as can be.  No kibitzing with the staff, especially the phone answering and cash taking cashier.  She or he does not have a moment to do other than the job at hand.

The interior eating area is rather small and half of the seats are along the wall opposite the line of people ordering or picking up.  Just not a lot of space inside.  The enclosed/tented area gives more seating, and is OK for cold weather, but really cold weather not so good.  We have not been back for a bit so don't know if they put in heaters."}
{"text":"Pretty damned close to the perfect pizza I've ever had. I tried it last night, my first night in Calgary. The Lorenzo and Enza...amazing and just the right amount of spicy heat. So, I had to try another one tonight, my second night in town. Montreal Special. Now I just need to figure out what to get tomorrow. Seriously this place is just that amazing. Super friendly delivery guys!"}
{"text":"Have picked up take-out several times and agree with other reviewers they r never friendly! I will say we have enjoyed the Pizza until tonight. 2 pizzas a large with two toppings and a 10 inch Gluten free that was OK for $48 dollars? Yes I said 2 pizzas for 48 Dollars!!! Well never Again. Good Bye and Good Luck!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure if we buy into the raving reviews at least not yet.  Good pizza but not sure if it gets a 4 or 5 but maybe because we just ordered standard Hawaiian and Albertan beef pizzas.  Solid ingredients but not sure if it was a step change from other pizza places.  
Will however give them another chance as their speciality pizzas may be giving them the  edge in the reviews on Yelp."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here from skip the dishes several times and the quality has dropped substantially each time. From the little to no sauce on the wings to forgetting drinks and the pizza crust being pretty much black burnt to the point I couldn't eat it which was super disappointing because I payed over $50 for my meal. All of this was a surprise because I read raving reviews! None of which I could relate to. I contacted skip the dishes and they said the owner would get back to them. Wow thanks guys !! I will NOT be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is giant and you'd better have a large appetite to stomach it all! Personally it's quite heavy for me and I can usually eat A LOT of pizza but I was only able to eat two large slices. It was layered with a lot of cheese and meat which was really good but the taste was overwhelming. Maybe next time I would try a more simple pizza rather than getting a meat lovers...I was in a huge food coma post consumption."}
{"text":"Awful!  If anyone thinks this is close to NY pizza, they are sadly mistaken.  The pizza has no flavor at all.  The chicken piccata was TOO salty and not fit for consumption.  The pasta was lukewarm had to be sent back.  Service, well, forget it.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"I initially had another place as THE best NY pizza in Charlotte, but now Lorenzo's is my super favorite. Nice, hot, fresh and cheesy deliciousness. There's a bit of salt on the cheese but adds to the goodness.  Also got the penne ala vodka, which was just as amazing. It had some gooey cheese in it too. Pasta was a bit overcooked but i think overall it was great."}
{"text":"Every one of my visits to Lorenzo's has been devoid of any problems, and ends with my friends and I leaving full and content.  I usually only go with a group (as one would prefer at any typical sit-down pizza place) and split one or two large pies between us. I've always been told it's best to order a full pizza to be freshly made rather than to just get reheated individual slices, so if you want any tips at all, always go for that.  Anyways, anything from your basic cheese or pepperoni to chicken parmesan is fantastic; the pizza's crisp with just the right amount of everything.  Oh, and it helps that there's an ice cream shop next to Lorenzo's too, for afterwards."}
{"text":"Having moved from ny, I have been searching for ny style pizza and stopped here on a random sunday afternoon and got pleasantly surprised. I had a white pizza slice which took a little longer to be served but was absolutely delicious and reminded of ny pizza taste. Will definitely come back to try other varieties. Yummm!"}
{"text":"I need to let everyone know what type of gluten free food this restaurant serves...I appreciate them so much adding to their menu...gluten-free foods.  I went into the restaurant at lunch and ordered Pasta(gluten-free), tomato sauce and an order of sauteed broccoli.  I asked the owners son three separate times after I waited 30 minutes about my dish and then I asked him again when it hit the 45 minute mark of waiting.  I asked him where my food was and how soon it would take me to get it.  He ignored me and continued to talk and carry-on with the table behind me which I think his wife and some friends were and then the 3rd time after 50 minutes he acted like I bothered him by asking when I would get my lunch.  He told me close to an hour that it's all cooked fresh,  I can understand how cooking things fresh could take some time but  having owned a catering company and knowing it does not take nearly 1 hour to cook gluten-free noodles, boil some broccoli and open a can of petite tomatos diced(no seasoning) to noodles is just outrageous! Being in the food industry I understand how long something takes to be fixed.  But I had noticed when he stopped talking to the table behind me which was almost 50 minutes...I received and let me break-it down for you...1 soup bowl with gluten-free noodles, some petite diced tomatoes out of a can(NO SEASONING),  BOILED BROCCOLI THREE LITTLE PIECES.  MY LUNCH cost me for just that  $19.28!  I will never go back there...I had always heard how great they are...sorry they are not...and make sure if you do venture out to Lorenzo's that you bring Your Tomato Sauce and a Bowl Full of Broccoli if that's how much you will get and it will cost you!  I am warning you as well...make sure that NO ONE IS IN THE RESTAURANT WHEN YOU ORDER YOUR FOOD BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT ON THE OWNER'S SON TO FIX YOUR FOOD!!  Horrible experience and have found a new place that's wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, good price and above board service. Dano is the man!!!!  The meatballs rock for an app."}
{"text":"My favorite NY style pizzeria in the Ballantyne area. Pizza is always good. Nice salads. Pasta is also very good."}
{"text":"Crust was the perfect blend of crunchy and chewy. They have bottled beer and coke products on tap. They have a adjoining ice cream parlor offering authentic Italian ice and several  ice cream flavors. Tv's to catch the game on and out door seating."}
{"text":"Lorenzo's is right down the block from me, so we're always there for pizza. The pizza is very good--I like the lasagna slice as of now. The crust is thin and a little crunchy, and the cheese and tomato sauce is very good. The chicken marsala is also exceptional. I definitely would recommend it to anyone in south Charlotte looking for some quick pizza."}
{"text":"Love the pizza!!!! Prices are a bit high and not impressed with wings but pizza is truly NY style pizza!"}
{"text":"Another update after 3 more takeout visits.  This is now one of our two go-to places for thin crust pie - authentic IT style.  The keep it real with the appropriate amount of toppings to balance well with a great crust.  We get them \"slightly' undercooked and finish them on a pizza stone in our oven.  The more we go - the more we go!"}
{"text":"After seeing all the 5 star reviews I couldn't get to Lorenzo's fast enough.  Unfortunately the address listed for them in YELP took us to a residential address in Ballantyne.  When we called to find out their exact location, they indicated that the internet directions were incorrect.  In today's world of smart phones, I think that's something I'd fix pretty quickly.  When we finally arrived, we had a problem finding a decent seat.  Most of the empty tables were dirty and in need cleaning.  There was a game on that we wanted to catch on TV.  The good news is that they have a few around but not all of the tables are conducive to watching them.  As far as the pizza, we ordered 3 slices of 3 different varieties.  It appeared that they just plopped the raw onions, spinach, etc on top of a slice of cheese pizza.  Nothing fantastic about the taste either.  Maybe I don't appreciate real NY style pizza since I'm just a southern girl.  I don't know but I was disappointed it wasn't 5 stars in my book...."}
{"text":"We really love this pizza. I'm from NJ and my husband spent his summers in NJ so we have our strong pizza preferences. This place lives up to our hopes for an authentic pie. If you actually have leftovers, heat them in the oven on a piece of foil. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise... I prefer thin crusts for pizzas, and they know how to do it! We tried the Granny's Pie and the Pepperoni, and both tasted awesome! Definitely going back for seconds..."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the others writing reviews here. The people who work in this place are extremely rude and pathetic (with the exception of the cashier, she was really nice throughout). The rest have zero customer service. It took them 45 minutes to make our pizza and they gave us attitude once we finally got our food as if they did us a favour.

The owner said \"oh don't worry, once the pizza comes in you will forget about the wait\". Well I'm sorry, the customer service world does not work like that. A crappy experience is crappy no matter what. The food was good but the arrogance from the employees ruined the experience for me. Learn how to talk to customers and how to treat them properly. 

One of my friends told him that we are from Toronto and we are used to having our pizza made faster and that ticked the guy off further lol! He told us to go the airport and leave right away since Toronto sucks at everything (throw in some swearing on top), just adding more fuel to the fire. After this point he continued to speak Arabic with his Co workers and laugh while looking at us which is something I've seen elementary school kids do. 

My experience here seems consistent with the other review below. These guys are short tempered and immature and have no idea how to treat customers."}
{"text":"I took my mother here when she was visiting out of town.  She and I both love pizza, and this was by far the worst pizza I've ever had.  It was completely tasteless.  Not sure how I can't give it 0 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"The sauce is crap. Sorry to be so bold, but it is. I went for lunch and got the chicken parm special, which comes with a side of penne in their marinara sauce. What startled me at first was how *bright red* the sauce was, and I don't mean that in a good way. It tasted like pureed canned tomatoes -- no garlic, no seasoning at all. Jarred sauce is far better! The chicken parm was good. Service was eh. The setup is so strange that you order at the host stand, get a number, and then they bring you your food. I can't believe more people haven't complained about this. I'm in no rush to ever go back."}
{"text":"Best grandma pie around. Crust is thin and crispy. All around best pizza place in the area. They have online ordering which I think is great on those busy night where you just want to pick up."}
{"text":"Friday night pizza craving, so we stopped at Lorenzo's. Place was packed and lines of diners ordering pizza. We were told about a 35 minute wait. One stands in line to order, has a table number and food brought to the table.

We ordered a large cheese pizza, 8 large slices for about $15.00, plus a large house salad for one,$6.95

The menu had food choice for assorted Italian entrees, appetizers, salads , Heros,  calzones,  etc, moderate prices. Other pizza too such as Sicilian thick crust, or pizza by the slice. Kids menu also available

No one asked what kind of salad dressing we wanted so we got balsamic instead of a favorite,  blue cheese. Later we saw a sign that said ask for your dressing when ordering salad. The waitress was friendly and attentive and brought out blue cheese.

 The pizza was brought to our table on a large pizza stand and spatula for easy serving.

Everyone  thought the crust, chewy, thin, was good but overall the pizza was  shiny, oily, with little sauce and bland.  It folded over easily with cheese sliding off the dough. We all agreed we have had better pizza elsewhere and this pizza was average  in our opinion


We had eaten pasta dinners there before and they were good as well as the salads but again we thought the food was basic and average for Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"When I used to work in the Blakeney area I would eat at Lorenzo's regularly. The pizza is really good, the sauce is amazing which is really important to me. I recommened the Gramma!"}
{"text":"I waited 20 minutes to have two slices warmed up to only be told that I would have to wait longer to have them warmed up. Offered to just give me cold pizza. What kind of pizza place has an oven smaller than a kitchen oven to warm up slices. Also, I'm from New York area and this place doesn't even come close.
Staff was nice."}
{"text":"This is just like eating in Brooklyn,  the pizza is the best and the dinners are absolutely delicious.   Service is great and the prices are lower then expected for the amount and quality of the food.  Our favorite pizza joint."}
{"text":"Pizza is my all time favorite food and I like them all (thin crust, deep dish and ....) 

On a drunk Friday night,  I decided to visit Lorenzo to answer my pizza craving. We ordered large Prosciutto Pizza and large bacon pizza (almost 22$ each). It was more than enough for 8 hungry guests. I also got the garlic bread, which was nothing special. Not my favorite part of the dinner. 

Both pizzas were delicious, However,my favorite was the Prosciutto . Highly recommended. The pizzas are heavily covered with toppings and the crust is crispy on the outside and soft inside. Exactly the way I like it. There are a lot of tables so a good place for large groups, However, they are not licensed. So if you are in beer and pizza mood you should go for the take out option. 

Most important of all, they are open till 3 am. So next time you are craving late night pizza, give them a try. Usually, the quality of food drops rapidly after midnight on 17 ave. But Lorenzo, can be your salvation for a late night dinner."}
{"text":"Come for the pizza. Stay for the pizza.

When I think of the south I don't think of pizza. When I think of restaurants trying to bring a certain style of regional food to a new region, I usually don't like it. However, Lorenzo's pulls it off. Their pizza was really good. I like my NY style pizza large and dripping with greasy goodness. That is exactly what the gave me. Only problem is the New York decor to force the patrons to think that they're in New York."}
{"text":"Verry unhappy go in their all the time. Just once didnt feel good asked them to deliver they said WE AE TOO BUSY"}
{"text":"Didn't even get pizza bc the service was TERRIBLE. It took forever for someone to even greet us and the waitresses were rude and ignored us when we called them as they walked by."}
{"text":"Whenever I order for pickup they always get it wrong. Also a little bit rude over the phone Imo. It's just pizza not a 3 coarse meal."}
{"text":"I went last night with my 4 year old who had a hankering for some pizza and I didn't feel like calling Dominos.  Being from Long Island I try not to eat pizza out because I'm always both disappointed and baffled why in the heck someone cannot make a pizza exactly how they do in NY.  There's plenty of people here from the northeast but yet nobody can do it.

Lorenzos was very crowded and it is somewhat refreshing to find a locally owned business that is truly busy and seemingly making money.  Lots of customers standing around waiting to order and a waiting to get a seat.  The ordering / seating process is a mess.  Customers standing around with paper menus, a \"half wall\" with 2 cashiers and people on both sides and no direction on who is doing what and consequently I had no idea where to go.  I stood there long enough and a cashier finally corralled me and asked me what I wanted to order.  I ordered a few slices that I chose from the window and she had to call back and see if they had them to the many guys in the back (of course they had them I just saw them in the window!).  I was given 2 drink cups and a number.  Off to find a seat.  

As I said, everything was pretty much full.  They have tables right at the entrance, and one opened up but with all of the people standing confusedly at the front door waiting for take out and standing their confused these tables were less than desirable.  I finally found one in the back after stalking a family that was about to finish first.  I felt like a parking stalker at the mall waiting for that perfect spot to open up.

The pizza itself was OK.  I had a Sicilian slice and it was decently puffy as good Sicilian pie should be with a nice sauce and a good, thick layer of cheese.  The regular Pie was just meh.  No definable crust, but the sauce was good.  The regular pizza had been sitting a while in the window which baffles me with all the people there.  I guess they mostly get orders for whole pies so the slices get neglected.

Overall, as my 3 stars indicate, it was OK.  I'll be back since it's close to home and the pizza is OK.  I will most likely go during the middle of the week since I want to avoid the swarms."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Lorenzo's since they opened.  So, why only 3 stars?  After all of these years, I finally think I can write a justified review.  First I want to say that we love the Grandma's Pie..best in the city or maybe anywhere else.  If you notice, all of the previous reviews talk about the pizza.  So, I am going to talk about what they are not taking about..First - the wine is horrible.  I've suggested many times that they get better tasting wine and up their price.  Right now they charge $5 a glass for the worst tasting wine in the world.  It's gotten to the point, that if I'm in the mood for a drink with my pizza, I'm going to one of the other Ballantyne restaurants to have a good drink with dinner. Tonight we ordered the house salad.  Thinking back on the house salads recently, the tomatoes are not ripe and the lettuce is iceberg that is more white than green.  My son likes the kids spaghetti and meatball (one meatball), which is a good size for the child.  He also likes garlic knots.  These are not knots, they are pull apart rolls that have garlic and butter on them.  However, the sauce that comes with the garlic \"knots\" is very good.  Tonight we ordered the special, baked ziti with eggplant.  Unfortunately, while the ziti and eggplant may have tasted good..it was hard to tell since it was drenched in tomato sauce and one huge slab of mozzarella cheese.  The sauce was just ok and tasted like it was out of a jar with no seasoning.  How can you make a good sauce to go with the \"knots\" and not have good sauce on the ziti.  Thinking back to other entrees we have had, they were also drenched in sauce that could have been much tastier. We also had ordered the meatball parm sub.  This was done very nice - 6 medium size meatballs on a sweet soft roll.  So, to sum it up..if you are looking for a good pizza head to Lorenzos, but you'd better not want to have a good drink to go  a log with it..Just stick to pizza at Lorenzo's."}
{"text":"By far the best and most consistent pizza in the area. We have tried Tony's, Mama's, Libretto's....and find ourselves coming back to Lorenzo's. Their slices are delicious, their whole pies, their knots and even their entrees. We recommend them to anyone and everyone looking for pizza recommendations in Charlotte. Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"We are from Jersey and we are pizza snobs.  Had the grandma and meat lovers pizza and it was delicious! Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"While I haven't eaten here yet, they're bookmarked because of their excellent customer service.  Organizing some catering for our clients in Calgary, they know what they're doing---just give them a budget, how many ppl, and they'll make it happen.  Seem to service the corporate world quite well.

Deliver all day, and to most parts of Calgary.  

and if Yelpers here have already contributed to over 100+ photos, that's a positive sign."}
{"text":"Extremely average pizza at best, but average pizza usually would get two to three stars... Lorenzo's gets one star because their customer service is pathetic.

I usually order from Tony's in Ballantyne, but we just moved to a house closer to Lorenzo's... so we gave them a shot. We had eaten there once a long time ago, and weren't very impressed. But again, due to proximity, we took another shot.

My wife called in the order and when I picked it up, I forgot to tell the kid at the register that I had a Ballantyne Corporate card (20 percent off). He said he already ran my credit card and it couldn't be fixed. He said he'd asked the manager. Then this teenage girl who looked no older than 15 said she was the manager and that the computer couldn't change the charge. I happen to know this was complete bullsh*t because if people pay with credit cards and leave a tip, they re-run the new amount. Plus, credit sales can be canceled and re-run no matter what system you have. But, I guess the owner must be raking in enough cash to piss off the occasional customer while having ignorant prepubescent managers running the place.

Save yourself the headache and get better pizza... go to Tony's or Libretto's."}
{"text":"I've lived in neighborhood for 5 years now and the pizza is a go-to for us, truly a slice that feels like you're in NYC. However in the past few months they have hired some younger employees who don't seem very aware of what they're doing.. They used to be joined to an ice cream shop but now that door is locked and you have to order ice cream in pizza shop with no choice of condiments. Got a cone the other day and I'm still upset at how freezer burnt it was. Pizzas great- pass on the ice cream."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas in calgary! Competitive prices and good service! I personally love the four cheese while my partner likes the all meat ones. Yummy chicken wings and caesar salad! I have yet to try more pizza flavours but this is one pizza delivery you will be truly happy about!!!"}
{"text":"Freaking delicious pizza! The slices are huge and so so good. The ice-cream is also good! Love this place."}
{"text":"I called in an order Saturday night, and was told it would be ready in 20. I arrived and  the staff greeted me right away which was  appreciated. I was in and out in less than 3 min.  

I enjoyed their delicious chicken parmesan sandwich. They did not skimp on the cheese and their sauce is really good. Just be sure to request a paper plate and napkins if you aren't bringing it home.   

The bill came to a little over $9 which is fairly standard, it also was big enough for me to get two meals out of it if I wanted. 

While I was in and out quickly I did observe lots of families - it looks like a nice place to go after a game or if you want to enjoy the weather on the patio. I'd be curious to try their pizza as it looked delicious- NY style just the way I like : )"}
{"text":"So 23 days later I receive this Yelp \"Compliment\" from Lorenzo's, disputing my review:

\"Mam . We have a order everry night to the casino poker room at 4 am and the driver was gonna be late delivering that order . So when he came back at the shop it was 3:45 I think your timing was really wrong . But we are sorry for any misbehaviour . As what we say the customer always right\"

I have the call history recorded in my phone, it's clear as day what time I was called, and what time I returned those calls (well before 3:45 a.m.). I also really appreciate the psuedo-apology for 'misbehaviour', when in fact, their driver swore at me in a voicemail message. The customer's always right? Even when you tell them to f*** off? Class acts.

My Original Review:

Worst service ever. Ordered online through skipthedishes tonight, and were quoted a delivery time of 3:15 (an hour after the order was placed). No problem, we're up. Miss the apartment buzzer and the driver's call by four minutes (at 3:03 am). Call back at 3:07, and am told by the driver that he's already back at the shop (pretty impossible to get from inglewood to 17th in four minutes...). Call the shop to let them know how rude the driver was, and the person answering the phone proceeds to argue that they tried to deliver over 15 minutes ago (impossible, it's now 3:10, so my first missed call was now 7 minutes prior), but could send the pizza again if we really want. Having now been treated like complete garbage by two different people, I tell him he can keep his pizza. I then check my voicemail to find a profanity-laden message from the driver (again, left 7 minutes ago). I'm really not the type to leave negative reviews (there's enough negativity out there), but I'm completely shocked at the complete lack of professionalism from Lorenzo's. It's one of the few decent pizza joints open late, but I'd rather eat lousy Pizza 73 than be yelled/sworn at by their staff."}
{"text":"As a former New Yorker, I take pizza very seriously - this passed the test.  It's greasy, cheesy, and folds well.  The menu looks exactly like the our old slice places in Long Island (Pietro's in East Meadow will always be #1).   We got a meatball pizza and garlic knots and they were exactly what I had hoped for.  My husband picked up both times that we have ordered so I haven't eaten in the restaurant yet - but looking forward to trying more of the menu."}
{"text":"Loved their chicken alfrado, and it has great service. I would defiantly reccomend this place to a friend for somebody whos lookin to go Italian.  :) yummyum"}
{"text":"The best pizza I have EVER had! . Thank you for bringing back my love for Pizza . So happy I found this place."}
{"text":"Love Lorenzo's pizza... It tasty not greasy..
Want to eat all the time..
Chicken wings is perfect cook.. 
Tried many different kind of pizza.. Love them all.
They have a new menu.. Will try it soon!!
Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Just an update on some other foods we tried here - We had Spaghetti with garlic, oil, and Broccoli the other night.  All The garlic in the dish was burnt rather than flavorful, there were mostly stems and not as much florets , and the portion size was meh for the price. You can feel That it was rushed to order, and not much care to the simmering. You might think In NYC that pasta dish  prices are high, and they are but the at the top of the Italian food chain (no pun intended) leaves you full, and awaiting another delicious experience. I wouldn't necessarily get that again here!

We also had a calzone, which is consistently very good!! A few sandwiches, which I must say also for $9-$10 each could be larger meatballs, they get lost in the bread...this this isn't kids spaghetti o's, and the sausage was good but also not very full with a lot of pepper.  Just overall more ABUNDANT PORTIONS for the price point would be appreciated , and go a long way....

P.s.- The ingredients are generally very good, and fresh!! 

UNFORTUNATELY, The competition for real good Italian food is slim in this vicinity. So it ranks well amongst all the chains, and commercialized food infiltrating real authentic cuisine.


THE END."}
{"text":"This pizza sucks.  I don't have any idea why people say this is on par with NY.  They don't have a clue.  Not good and not going back."}
{"text":"This has been our \"go to\" Italian place since we moved here several years ago.  But the past two times there it wasn't even mediocre.  All young kids working the kitchen, neither of the owner brothers to be seen.  My husband's pizza slices were rubbery and my chicken parm hero had dry chicken  cutlet on the bread with the cheese on top of that and then the sauce on top of the mozzarella. No sauce on the chicken at all.  Will probably give it one more shot before we call it quits."}
{"text":"Really?  All you people who say this is real NY Pizza...... Have you ever really eaten pizza in NY????  Bland.  Cheap cheese....cardboard crust.  
Ridiculous."}
{"text":"First time ordering from Lorenzo's and I am thoroughly impressed! Pizza arrived hot, delivery guy was very friendly, and the pizza is super tasty! I think I've found my new favourite pizza place."}
{"text":"The white pizza is not good and over priced. No flavor, ... I've eaten here twice before and it was just okay. 

I tried this place for the last time last night. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I like Lorenzo's - the staff are generally local teens, so don't go in expecting white glove service, but they're all very friendly and they work hard, I can appreciate that. I usually go here with my elementary schooler as it's his favorite place to go for a slice of pizza. I have started to opt for the entrees (chicken & spinach, chicken parm, etc) - the entrees are generous portion sizes and come with warm bread and a pasta \"side\" that I tend to take home and eat for lunch the next day. The consistency is a bit spotty (some days it's uber salty sauce, some days it's down right lick-the-plate worthy). That said, I continue to rely on Lorenzos as it's conveniently located and never has a ridiculous wait time and that's important when you're feeding a mini-human who's not mastered the art of patience just yet."}
{"text":"I wanted to write a review because I had eaten pizza here before and thought it was great.  They've really gone downhill.  The pizza had no sauce, way too much cheese, super thin crust, and a lot of grease.  Poor customer service too and we don't ask for much, just a pleasant attitude.  If you want excellent New York style pizza, go to Brooklyn pizza on Rea road."}
{"text":"Definitely the best NY style pizza I've had in the CLT area. Service is also good and they can get very busy on a Friday night so call ahead for takeout."}
{"text":"Just moved to the neighborhood and decided to try this place. It's a huge pizza that is good, not great.  Try it by the slice first, not sure the taste is worth the whole pie."}
{"text":"Danno at Lorenzo's made our dinner such a lovely experience. Great customer service. Good pizza, awesome wings, fresh Caesar salad. The quality is good. 

It's a dive on 17th ave, with solid food, across from the Living Room and Ming. There are a couple of parking spots, nice and easy. What's interesting is that the manager who cooked and served us has a fine dining background. So it's quality but doesn't look it right from the beginning. We decided to give it a chance. We were glad we did. We got 5-star service, complete with enjoyable stories about Calgary, restaurants, and hungry NHL hockey players who've eaten his food throughout the years. 

We got a window seat and I don't mind waiting for good pizza. The timing was perfect, Dan brought out two separate plates of delicious Caesar salad to start, we asked for light on the dressing and it was great. Without asking he divided it in the kitchen on two separate plates. Perfect service. He brought some dressing on the side if we wanted and we did. Then he suggested the dry Cajun wings when we asked him and they were great. Piping hot, delicious and fresh. 

Then came the pizza. We enjoyed it. Even the next day, the pizza was good. The ambiance isn't \"classy\" but the washrooms are clean, the staff is real and so is the food. Long live real food!"}
{"text":"As close to NY pizza you're going to get in the queen city. The prices don't exactly match the whole in the wall price you pay in nY or Jersey, but it is worth the cost to be transported to the land of good pizza."}
{"text":"Awesome pizzas!! All the pizzas are great!! I loved the Lorenzo super special with pesto sauce!! That's the best!!... All other pizzas were delicious as well.. My second favorite would be the 4 cheeses pizzas... But all others were great too... The only improvement opportunity is the waiting time (only because of that I am not going to give them 5 stars) ... It is certainly worthy, but I think they could be faster... Other than that everything was great!!.. These are real Italian pizzas and I would love to go back there soon.. I just will call to order before arriving, if I am hungry..."}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery this evening and waited over 90 minutes. Frustrated, I called them to see what was going on and no one could answer any of my questions. I could hear the cashier yelling at the driver in the background, & laughing hysterically. My order never arrived. This is completely unacceptable. I have never experienced anything quite like this before."}
{"text":"PIZZA????  CALZONE???HahahahahhahahahhahahahhahHHhahHHhHhahhahhahahahhahahahhahahhahahhahahahhhahahhhahahhahhahhahahahhahahhahahhHHhahahahhHHhhahhahahhahahhahahhahahhhahhahahhahahhhahhahahahhahhah.                 Have a seat and come back to front to order????
I have an idea!!! Why not use the people who bring you the so called food out to you as waiters and waitresses to take your orders????Hahahahahahahahahhahhahahahahahahhahahahhahahhahahahha"}
{"text":"Tried this place out as we are trying to find a go to pizza place. Took a moment for us to figure out what we wanted as you have to order at a register then sit yourself. The guy up front at the register got ticked off because someone took the pen used to sign the credit card slips. After yelling at 3 people to find a pen, he found one on the floor.  Just odd to me. 

We got pizza and a salad. The salad was good - it's a salad, nothing special. 
The pizza however, was soggy wet with grease.  The taste of the ingredients were good and you could tell they appeared the be fresh. But my gosh, there was so much grease, you won't need a drink to eat. 

So close - but you can't serve that and expect people to come back. When you pick up a slice and it's flops straight down with grease coming off - that's an issue."}
{"text":"I have moved from New York a couple of months ago and yes, I know about thin crust pizza. I ordered half pepperoni and half mushroom&meatball pizza. It was thin but not crust. Not enough pizza sauce and cheese either. You can order a thin pizza from typical pizza chains and get a similar pizza with better price. I probably expected too much. I will keep exploring some other places to see if they can make real thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"Officially my favourite pizza in town....we ordered a half and half, half pepperoni mushroom and half Mexican. PERFECT amount of ingredients on each,u got a mouthful of all ingredients in each bite. Order showed up on time, thanks Frank!!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've had in the Charlotte area. The servers are on top of things. The deep dish is great. It's a little hard to get to but with the drive."}
{"text":"They deliver. Just not if it's too far and a hassle for them. 8:00pm on a Monday and I'm 8kms away. Yelp said it was a good option but I'll go with someone who wants my business."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte hands-down! After living here for 11 years, I have finally found a pizza place that I absolutely love. Amazing pizza and fantastic service!"}
{"text":"I was visiting my Mother, who recently moved to the area, and we decided to order pizza and a salad. Upon arrival, the place was packed..which was a good sign. There appeared to be two lines, for ordering and pick-up, however a little disorganized. We ordered a Caesar salad and the White Pizza, 1/2 with grilled chicken. For me, typically when you order a salad for pick-up they do not dress it. Unfortunately Lorenzo's did, and with a lot of dressing. Needless to say the lettuce was soggy and it just didn't seem like the crisp Caesar that I love. As for the pizza, it was good. Huge, but cooked very well and I enjoyed it, somewhat similar to the New York style I have always loved. I look forward to going back, but will eat in next time."}
{"text":"I used to love this place when  it first opened but it seems like it has changed.  Crust has been CHEWY and pizza tastes blah.....and pricey!"}
{"text":"I do like their pizza here as far as NY Style. Wings are good. Beyond that the food tastes a little microwaved."}
{"text":"Great pizza at a great price. The crust was delicious and you get what appeared to be a quarter of a pizza per order. I would highly recommend coming here if you are in the area."}
{"text":"We moved to Charlotte a few months back and this is the most horrible rendition of NY Style pizza I have ever had. They use the cheapest cheese and the sauce is so flavorless I had to cover the slices as I ate them with garlic and red pepper. Other places in Charlotte are much better. As we ate we couldn't believe how busy this place was on a Friday night. This is NOT authentic NY style pizza. I would have given it zero stars if possible.

Do not waste your time."}
{"text":"This is a great place for apps and food. We tried the calamari, fries and wings. The wings were super crispy. They were flavorful not spicy. I didnt like the wings only come plain but they have plenty of other food to make up for that. This place pays respect to New York and still has a giant pic of NC on the wall. LOVE IT! The staff was smiling and friendly and checked on us a couple of time. The calamri was good and I think they make their own sauce. We are taking the kids back to try the pizza. The fact the prices are good and kids eat free pasta on Mondays, along with the quality, and perfect service. This makes it a winner for us:) Keep up the great food and service you will have alifetime family here!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Always searching for a great local pizza place, and Lorenzo's is in my top 5. I will have to explore their menu further and try their pastas. Carbonara is my favourite meal and I see that it's listed on there (will test it out next time we order in!)"}
{"text":"I'm just finishing a mediocre and over priced lunch at Lorenzo's Pizzeria. The only employee who seemed to be working could not get my slices cooked to well done. I've never been to a pizza place that couldn't accomplish that simple request. There is what appears to be another employee sitting at a table watching the World Cup. 

I love pizza but will never return here. Terrible experience in every way."}
{"text":"Good pizza, not so great service. We reluctantly keep giving it a try because their grandmas pie is yummy, but every time we go there the employees seem to be clueless about everything. Also, they are always out of their Italian ice flavors. Just consistently inconsistent. We probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Best pizza south of New York!  Always delicious and always consistent. 
Even better is their community involvement and how they are always giving back.
Thanks John and Steven for making this former NYC girl feel a little closer to home with your delicious food."}
{"text":"nd unintersted in satisfying customers.   We will never buy pizza there again."}
{"text":"I am starting to think I have a pizza problem.

The problem is that I can't stop eating it.

I was introduced to Lorenzo's Pizzeria at the July Yelper's party, where I couldn't stop exclaiming over how good the piece of pizza I was jamming into my mouth was. I promptly grabbed their menu and vowed to visit the hub of this magnificent pizza glory.

I have now been twice to Lorenzo's, they have quite a large space, so if you wanted to eat in you have the option. Theodore took my order over the phone the first time and we started making Wedding Singer references (Julia Gulia). He was very friendly both times I have been in and makes a heck of a good pizza.

Nice crust, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. The pizza is covered in ample toppings. I would recommend the prosciutto pizza, where each slice has a full strip of meat and complemented with Gorgonzola cheese. Also the Funghi pizza is excellent, mushrooms AND a full strip of prosciutto on each slice. 
I will be trying more of their delicious pizza creations.

They also are open all the time and quite late, so if you need a delicious pizza pie, I would recommend Lorenzos!"}
{"text":"So today for lunch I had the baked ziti. It was perfect. I read another review here before I went, regarding the ziti and they said it was bad but it was from 2011 so I figured, eh let me try it. It was amazing! The sauce was seasoned and tasted delicious. The cheese melted perfectly over the top. It was just SO GOOD! And they only have one size, so the portion makes for lunch and dinner today and ill probably still have to wait until tomorrow to finish it off at lunch. So glad I went."}
