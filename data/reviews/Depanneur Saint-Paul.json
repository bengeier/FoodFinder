{"text":"I literally fell in love with this small cute coffee place It perfectly fits the Old Montreal neighbourhood. After a long walk when you need a short brake this place will be a great opportunity to recharge your energy with a cup of delicious coffee and a dessert.  The interior is very stylish with many elements of French heritage. Small pictures with historical figures are decorating the walls inside, which is nice to descry seeping your beverage.  The cafe has a store inside with hundreds of different sweets and types of chocolates.  I think that my trip to Montreal wouldn't be complete without visiting this coffee place."}
{"text":"A cute pastry and coffee shop that also has some essentials such as milk, cheese, wine, cold brew coffee, toiletries, etc.  Much nicer than a typical march√©.  The staff speaks English just fine and was very helpful when I was trying to find something to eat for breakfast that was non-dairy.  They have a huge assortment of candy and fun things to look at."}
{"text":"So much better than before. It's a much-needed business in the Old Port since there are not many places in the area for quality basics, such as their stock of locally-made products and meats.  I'll be a regular customer, as I work + live in the neighbourhood."}

{"text":"Don't cry over spilled milk... Cry over a bad cookie!   I wanted something sweet...because they make me happy. When I walked into Depanneur Saint-Paul I thought it was a cute little pastry shop. There were delicious treats everywhere and coffee! My two favorites things! I was overwhelmed because I saw so many pastries, candy and sweet things that I wanted to eat. I absolutely love cookies, even though donuts are delicious, cookies are my favorite. I consider a good cookie soft, moist, and fresh. The best kind of cookies are the ones right out of the oven. I know I can't always expect that from a shop. After looking at all the treats I decided on a sugar cookie with cream inside. The lady that worked there described it kind of like an Oreo.  Unfortunately, the cookie was hard as a rock. When I say hard as a rock I mean it was hard to bite into. When the guy first handed me the cookie, I noticed it felt kind of hard so I asked him if he could heat it up. I mentioned that the cookie was hard but he didn't seem to care. I probably should have said this cookie is not acceptable and I don't want it.  Once he handed it to me after he supposedly heated it, I felt obligated to take it.   I also ordered coffee but when they gave it to me it was cold. I did not order an iced coffee, I ordered a hot coffee, and once again I should've said something. The really kicker is I paid $7 for two things that I just threw out. I'm sure there were a lot of other products that were not this bad however they shouldn't serve cookies that are old, or not fresh. There really is no reason why a cookie should be sold like that, especially when he was aware of it.   I sure hope they have a lot other things that aren't worth crying over!"}
{"text":"Depanneur Saint-Paul is a delightful little coffee and sundries shop in the heart of Old Montreal.   The coffee bar carries your traditional coffee/espresso beverages plus a smattering of pastries and prepared foods like salads, wraps, etc. I had just gulped down a large coffee and sandwich from another place so I didn't indulge but the menu looked great and the offerings in the case looked delicious.   It's a bit tight in there and when there's a line for the coffee bar it can be a bit hard to maneuver but it's worth being a little patient and looking through the shop. There are some real gems in there--from delicious packaged cookies and meringues, candy bars, and hard candy, to kitchen staples like spices, salt, sauces, and even some toiletries like deodorant, toothpaste, etc. There's also a cooler against the back of the store with cold bottled beverages, milk, cheese, and the like.   If you live in the area or are traveling through, they have staples you need to get through the day. Be it caffeine and a muffin, or the mouthwash you forgot."}
