{"text":"Very expensive for the amount of alcohol in the margaritas.  Very small portions for the money.  Terrible service.  Waitress never checked on us.  Go to Arribas!"}
{"text":"The margs were watery and low on the alcohol.   The server treated my mother ( yes my MOTHER) like she was from outer space and water went empty more times than a trip across the desert.   Never been to another macayos but not gonna try after that visit."}
{"text":"Eek! Methinks not.... this clearly doesn't describe this place.  Eek! Foodpoisoning Ahead.  That would paint a picture like Bob Ross on this damn place.  1 out of the 8 beef mini chimichangas had chicken...  I think it was chicken, it's been awhile since I have tasted rancid meat... but it's a taste you don't forget.  The waitress didn't check on the food after we received it, manager ignored me at first and then asked me if he could get me something else.... didn't want me leaving \"hungry.\"  Don't worry... hunger is that last thing on my mind.  I told a group coming in that is isn't too late to turn around... they will probably read this later, so... I told you so."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant around. They have great chips and salsa plus the guacamole is handmade and delicious. I love their Chimichangas as well as the Margaritas. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants quality Mexican food."}
{"text":"Arrived at 9. Waited 15 min wile waiters passed us to seat us. Never seated us just left. Lazy service. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"We had a small catered going away event for a co-worker.  We were provided exceptional service from Shay, Espy and Becky.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"We love Macayos, however their new special Classic Margarita and Street Taco ($9.99) is lacking dimension.  The food is good, but the taco is petite petite.  More like something you would get for free at Happy Hour.  I mean 2 inches in diameter. Wow.  Macayos should either pull it from the menu or beef it up.  Macayos you have a reputation too uphold and this isn't helping.  Will still be your patron, but don't do this again please.  Suggestion give the mini street taco away with each classic margarita."}
{"text":"First time there, new in town.  Very good Chips.  Salsa was very tasty but runny.  Food was very hot.  Beef in my wife's Fried Chimi was questionable, and big portions of tortilla were raw.  My Baja Burrito was pretty good.  Got the pork, and after tasting the beef in wife's, I'm so glad I did.  Rice was OK, Beans very good.  Place was very clean, nice atmosphere, good service.  I'd possibly go back in a few months, but we really don't like Pepsi."}
{"text":"The food was terrific and the wait service was kind. The salsa was delicious--I ate my whole cup. I very highly recommend the Tinga Quesadillas; they were amazing! Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Go way backwith the Macayo experience  to El Nino (sp?) on McDowell Street in Phoenix in the 1940s.... now live in Chicago...winter in Scottsdale...Macayos on Scottsdale Road is my local favorite for dinner about three times a week.  Love the food, love the burrios enchilada style, love the shedded beef tacos and enchiladas.  Great quick service.  Take out is also convenient.   Love this place.  Counting the days until the next stay in Scottsdale and many many dinners at Macayos."}
{"text":"Yesterday, we stop in for a late lunch. We decide to split a couple appetizers. While we are waiting they brought us the normal chips and salsa. The chips tasted stale and the salsa was pretty gross too. Then our food came. We ordered loaded nachos - which were far from loaded. I am still trying to figure out how they managed to put everything in one tiny corner of the plate. The second plate was the mini chimis. Oh my gosh, they were even worse! Soggy, covered in sour cream and what I think was guacamole?  They were inedible! Yuck! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. No no no"}
{"text":"We have eaten at this location with our family for at least the last 20 years. They have remodeled, cleaned up the dining area and completely overhauled the menu deleating many favorite items. The service was horrible, we waited nearly an hour for our food which arrived in a smaller portion and lacked any flavor of Macayo's. Very disappointing and hopefully the chain does not implement this new menu through all the restaraunts."}
{"text":"I was in this place for lunch today and had the chicken fajitas. They were great. But what really impressed me was my server, Fernando. He was did an excellent job on all levels. Greeted me warmly and promptly, served me promptly, used my name and told me about the lunch card and brought it to the table. (Which I hadn't known about) after 5 lunches the 6th is free. I would definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Have not gone to Macayo's in a long time so thought I would try it out on Valentines day. It was one of the only places I could make a reservation and get seated early in the night.  The reasons I had stopped going here all the time still seem to be apparent.  The server was nice but not very personable at all.  Just going through the motions.  Was never offered more chips and fresh salsa..or another beer. ordered a salad to share.  Not even halfway through our salad the main courses showed up. Not very happy with that. The food is very bland tasting. I used to think Arribas was mediocre, this was a step down from that. The brava sauce and the salsa with the chips was very watery and bland. No flavor. I think something was wrong with the sour cream on the side we shared because we both had unsettled stomachs later in the night.  Everyone working their seemed to be in a state of mind of rather being somewhere else.  Over heard personal conversations, the hostess stand was a gossip station. I still tipped the waitress well because it is not necessarily her fault she was trained to just go through the motions. And when you ask someone if they would like their burrito enchilada style, pls mention there is a charge for that. Our waitress made it sound more like an offer. Sticking with Manuel's from now on"}
{"text":"Hold on to your wallet and check your bill. Then double check your bill. The whole time we were there the waitress asked us over and over again if we wanted sour cream or guacamole or Baja sauce and on and on and on without mentioning ANYTHING about the items costing extra. When we got the bill I saw why. She managed to work that bill up 50% in just condiments! On top of that she charged us for an extra drink which we did not get. It was our first time there and after eating we were happy to have found a new place to eat. Sadly, after the car salesman approach from the wait staff, we will have to pass."}
{"text":"Ate here with a small group from work mid week for lunch. Ordered the Green corn tamales.  I don't find these often enough and order them whenever I find them.  Very good. Sevice was good, knowledgeable.   Ambiance was fine.  The place is a local chain, i believe, but it is good."}
{"text":"Came in from Colorado and tried this place on a whim. The service was amazing. The food was great and it was so quick. We just really enjoyed our experience here. We never receive this level of customer service anywhere in colorado."}
{"text":"I had been to Macayo's numerous times not because I wanted my colleagues like the place. Every time I go I notice the value of the food and taste is getting worst. Today I went and ordered Chicken Fajitas with side veggies. The fajitas didn't come out sizzling they looked like they must have sat in the window for awhile. The veggies are ice cold with tons of butter and barely cooked. The chicken tasted like they been freezer burned and no seasoning. The dish wasn't appetizing at all.  Also, I service isn't the best  I was with a group and had leftovers and wanted a box and the server didn't even come around. Just drop off the check and walk away. I wouldn't recommend going to this place if you want some good Mexican food."}
{"text":"I've been visiting this place a couple times a month for the last two years for lunch. Food is always good and service generally pretty good too.  Today was my first experience with a lovely young lady by the name of Espy. She was delightful and attentive without hovering. Best of all she recommended dolling up their already yummy tortilla soup with a little more broth, chicken and shrimp. I ended up with one of the best BIG bowls of tortilla soup I've had in a long time!!"}
{"text":"When I went here , the rice tasted like chemicals and bandaids it was very strange. Everything else was good though. Waiter was nice, but the Owner was a bit rude and unprofessional. I Would go to Mesa location over this one any day, good thing it's closed now."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this Macayo's three times, and each time I leave unimpressed.  The service is ok, the food is ok.  That's about it.    The plates I've ordered were drowning in cheese - now I love cheese, but I almost need a spoon to eat these meals.    I know some people have raved about Macayo's, but I'm not thrilled with it."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times with the most recent time being a month ago. The food is good and the lunch specials are great and economical. Complimentary chips and salsa while you wait for your order is also a plus.   Some folks don't like the fact that the building is an old temple themed building, but personally I like it. I like the fact that it's the original Macayo's building from the 60's, but maybe I'm more of a purist. Would I prefer for it to be torn down and have a modern establishment with touch screen ordering and wi-fi and all that other technology? No. But that's just me.   The staff is friendly and courteous, this is also a plus. It's preferable over rude or neutral tempered staff right? The waiter held a conversation with us concerning Obama's visit to Macayo's.  For the \"Mex & Match\" lunch special I ordered a cheese enchilada and chile relleno with a side of beans. The enchilada was very good and even the beans were very good, as simple as beans are. My only issue was the chile relleno. It didn't have much of a chile flavor to it, kinda bland. It tasted more like the sauce it was topped with. But don't hold this against Macayo's. These type of chile's spiciness and flavor are very random. I know this from my experience with eating them. One can be very flavorful and spicy and the next one can be bland. So, I'm not gonna hold that bland chile against Macayo's.   If your wondering about price, I spent about $11.00 for this meal including the drink. My only issue with the service was the same waiter who conversed with us about Obama's visit, asked for a tip at the begging when he introduced himself. It sounded rehearsed and something to the effect of: \"Hi my name is so-and-so, I am your waiter today, a small tip would be appreciated...etc.\" I don't like that. I was planning to leave a tip, and I'm sure most people leave one, so asking for a tip to me almost sounds like begging. Other than that, no problems.   I plan future trips."}
{"text":"I went there last night and having been to other Macayo's, this one was a let down. The service was horrible (once I got service) and the food and drinks were definitely lacking. After waiting wondering if we even had a server, he finally got us water and complimentary chips. The server left the menu's on our table after we ordered. After they set there and started becoming a burden to the available table space, I got up and took them to the manager standing at the front.  I had the Steak fajitas and my date had shrimp fajitas. We had the margaritas that were on special and they were terrible. I would rather go to La Pinata a few blocks north versus going to this Macayo's again. Nothing is worse than watching everyone else get service and your having to bus empty glasses, return menus and wonder if your server went home or if you even have one."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  Our Server Sarah has been been so much fun and super friendly. And made sure our drinks were refilled and our food served quickly.  I hope we get her again!"}
{"text":"Had a great server and warm chips and tasty fresh salsa. I had really good chicken enchilada with green chili sauce and Boyfriend had a good carnitas pork enchiladas. Good Mex-American place w/strong drinks. Try for quick lunch or weekday dinner."}
{"text":"So disappointed. I used to love coming here. But today noone seems to know what they are doing. Took 34 minutes to get our drinks. But as always... The food is delicious"}
{"text":"Like their counterpart Carlos O'Briens, Macayos knows what it is. They make simple American-style Mexican food with a big helpin' of cheese.  Also like Carlos their quality has dipped some of late, but it's still a decent place to get a bite to eat.  If you're eating in their cheese crisp is a treat (but a little goes a long way) and their chips and hot sauce are really good.  I used to like getting their red corn tacquitos, but they're consistently under-cooked and doughy in an unpleasant way when I order them now.  Apart from that most things on the menu are decent if desperately unhealthy.  The best thing on the menu is probably the Chicken Poplano--a poblano chili stuffed with chicken, breaded, fried and buried under baja and enchilada sauce.  An extra 200 flights up the treadmill if you order it though.  It's not light eating.  Overall it's a decent place with good service that could be a lot better with a little more consistency.  And please fix your red corn tacquitos.  They used to be great."}
{"text":"We had a party of 6 for a \"meet the family\" sort of event and showed up at 9 PM on Saturday night, and we received absolutely stellar service from our waitress Lincoln. Our original server disappeared after saying he would be right back, and Lincoln stepped in to pick up the slack, first taking our drinks and appetizer orders while she looked for our server and then taking over our table for the rest of our visit when he never returned. Everything came out quickly, all of our orders were accurate, our drinks and chips/salsa stayed refilled all night, and the food was great! Both the mothers that tried dishes with the Baja Sauce raved about it, and the two people that ordered the Sonoran Enchilada Sampler were very happy with everything. This was my most pleasant visit to Macayo's yet, and I can't say thanks enough to Lincoln for the top-notch service she provided for us! :)"}
{"text":"There is a reason why it is empty on a Sunday night. The worst chewy uncooked fachitas ever. I could see the blood. And the waitress did not come to check after the fiod. They agve us some discount so thus one more star. The tortilla soup was good."}
{"text":"I love Macayo's, especially this particular location. They always bring us unlimited chips and without an attitude. I then always order my pollo asada which is always done to perfection. U can also get $4 refills on drinks with this Macayo's cup that u can purchase for around $11. Talk about a deal :)"}
{"text":"I dunno the food was fine, OK, average, whatever you want to call it. The baja sauce got old pretty fast as it was just too rich and I only had it on one enchilada.  The food wasn't inedible (think borderline 2/3 star) just completely pedestrian.  The prices are pretty affordable I suppose.  Service felt rushed when the servers did show up and super super slow otherwise (took us over 2 hours for dinner) which ultimately dropped it down to 2 from 3 stars for me.    The bar did seem pretty happening though so maybe i'll comeback just for drinks or happy hour earlier in the day.  Wish I coulda tried this place in the 1950s, 60s or 70s just to compare."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the food at Macayo's.  But that is not the problem.   Service at the Scottsdale location is awful.  Lack of service, poor service and slow service is all too common.  Most staff act as though they can't be bothered with the customer.   There is rarely a host or hostess available...Too busy talking to other employees or outright avoiding customers.  When they aren't MIA, they don't even greet you!  NO people skills whatsoever.   When they finally seat you, good luck with the servers.   They too act as though you don't exist.    I have accepted the poor service here for the last time.   It rarely makes a difference when a complaint is made these days.  To not return is the best way to solve the problem.   They don't seem to care so why should we."}
{"text":"Disappointing. My husband and I chose Macayo's to celebrate our 1-year wedding anniversary. We walked in and there was no one there to greet us. We stood there for  minutes and multiple groups had begun to walk in. One server came to the front and did not acknowledge us at all. When the host finally came up they started seating people randomly rather than asking who had arrived first.   Once seated, we were yet again not greeted with a friendly smile and hello. Our waiter never introduced himself and came to our table a total of 4 times the entire night. Our plates were never cleared when finished and another waiter had noticed us sitting there finished for so long that he asked if we wanted refills and brought us our to-go boxes. The entire room had zero energy and not a smiling face on a single waiter. It was terrible service and no one there to say bye as we left."}
{"text":"We received exceptional service.  We were a group of 8 plus a baby and our server was Jose.  I worked in the restaurant industry for a long time and Jose is the best server I have ever encountered.  He was funny, informative, timely, friendly, and patient.  And he has the most wonderful singing voice!  He sang a birthday song to our special guest and blew us all away, it was the highlight of our evening.  The manager also stopped by to make sure we were all set with our meal and enjoying everything, which we were.  I had the Tinga Chicken Quesadilla at Jose's recommendation and it's my new favorite item on the menu.  This man has outstanding people and server skills.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"It's been a few months since I stopped in, nice to see Yolanda working the bar. My son & I received great service from her as usual. Thanks Yolanda!!!"}
{"text":"I was helped right away in being seated, but it took forever for the food once seated.  The food was HORRIBLE and actually was sent back by my colleage.  I wanted to send mine back, but did not want to make it worse.  There were hardly any people in the restaurant, what took so long?  No wonder the taco was burnt.  But the black slimy stuff on the red pepper, what was that?!  Also, no specials at happy hour time (4:30 on a weekday).  Never again."}
{"text":"Honestly this place has been going down hill for yeas and now that it has been renovated they charge more and provide less. The only good service that ever happens is at the bar with the bartenders. Tonight we ordered take out...it was sitting upfront for almost 10 minutes before anyone helped us and got home and it was cold. 2.00 for a side of rice that is literally a few spoons full and used to come with the meal for FREE!!! I am still amazed this location is open...new paint and a new menu and they lose all prospective."}
{"text":"Not the best, but not the worst. Just average. 2.95 for a fountain soda is a bit much! Probably won't go back"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years. Pretty decent overall. Rubbery fish tacos tonight. Not so good. But my hubby had the rolled tacos and loved them! Their calabacitas are the best!"}
{"text":"Good food and excellent service.  Espy our waitress was amazing.  I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"1 Star only because the hostess with pleasant it fell off from there absolutely no customer service. Say for over ten minutes with no waitress our waiter coming by to see if we wanted water, drinks or chips... We wanted to order drinks and dinner, we walked out"}
{"text":"Such a disappointment from the minute we walked in. The host was so rude and couldn't even look up to greet us.then he finally asked us how many and told us there would be a twenty minute wait because they were short staffed. I felt so bad for their staff because everyone at he restaurant was upset with the service. We were told this is the location for their test kitchen, so based on the taste of the food I would suggest they go back to testing their food and working on their service. I would say both service and food were horrible."}
{"text":"Yes I know Macayo's is a chain....but I like it...so sue me!  They do a good job with the classics and it is fairly consistent.  I go there for happy hour once a month with a group of people, and we always get great service.  The salsa is addicting and the half price appetizers at happy hour are a great deal!  The mini chimis, the spinach con queso and the cheese crisp are my favs.  I usually just end up getting a cheese crisp with a side of beans...and it comes out to like $6!  I also really like the Baja Shredded Beef Chimi....the meat is really tender and flavorful, and then it is covered in the creamy baja sauce...heaven!    I like to go for lunch during the week too because they have great lunch specials....I am a fan of the Tostada Grande...which is basically a tostada the size of a dinner plate!  So if I am in the mood for a classic standard...Macayo's fits the bill."}
{"text":"I had to downgrade my rating after last night's delivery. I received a free delivery coupon from Delicious Deliveries so we used it for dinner. There weren't a lot of options in my zip code so we settled on Macayo's.   We started out with the green corn tamale bites. I didn't care for them but my hubby seemed to enjoy them. They also gave us a big bag of chips with sides of salsa, pretty good as I stated in my previous review. For our entrees, my hubby ordered the steak fajitas & I ordered the carne asada burrito (with rice & beans added). Hubby said his fajitas were pretty good but my burro was gross. The bottom was so soggy I couldn't eat it as a whole, just picked at it & threw a lot away. For dessert I ordered the flan & since our order was over $30 we got a free dessert as well so I chose the mini chocolate chimis. The flan was ok & the chocolate chimis with ice cream were pretty good.   Total with tip & free delivery was about $50. We won't be ordering here again...I'm pretty much just done with the whole food delivery service thing after 2 expensive, not so great meals."}
{"text":"Good chimis. Good beer. Good service. Jerry was attentive, and funny. Good lunch! Thanks macayos!"}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars I would. Beyond rude host, some tall dude with a mustache. I work for postmates and I get deliveries here all the time and I guess their system did not pick up the order and he was beyond rude, indirectly calling me a liar. He kept asking me if I was at the right place in a very rude tone, after the 4th time he asked me I snapped and told him no I know what I'm doing. Finally some older women came over and helped me out. If that's a host than my god it doesn't set a good example for your restaurant i don't care how long you've been open."}
{"text":"Got the asada burro. It was okay... the server was very attentive but I think there are tastier authentic mexican restaurants that are more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The manager contacted me with an apology but it was a joke!! Never even addressed the terrible service we received!! Never go to this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I heard great reviews about this restaurant and we decided to give them a shot. One word can describe this place GROSS!!! The food sounded great but then you took a bite and ewww disappointment. The salsa was lame, the chips stale. There were only two good things about this place the soda and the waitress was nice. Other than that don't waste your money GO TO ABUELO'S...it may be on the west side but it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is very tentative, the food is beyond tasteful, and we loved how the manager introduced the story behind the creation of every dish we showed interest in. We've been to many Macayos but none can compare to this one. Thank you to Matt  and his staff for always ensuring your customers are taken care of!"}
{"text":"Macayos equals Average Food, Generous Margaritas, and consistent service. Went there last night and to our surprise was seated next to my inlaws so I guess that officially makes it a neighborhood center. This place comes to life on major game ngihts which is usually when I avoid it. I remember when the parking spilled over into vacant lots now office condos.  If your just looking for a good value split the fajitas and keep the chips comming. their salsa is on the watery side, but many people like it."}
{"text":"Salsa is key at a Mex restaurant - we got a soupy tomato mixture with some pieces of canned tomatoes in it.  We ordered skinny margaritas, which are typically less sweet than regular ones.  We got overly sweet margaritas and they were not at all generous with the tequila.  The finale was my stacked enchiladas, which consisted of three tortillas SWIMMING in a gooey mixture.  They were horrible and I sent them back.  They did bring another order with sauce on the side but we'll never return."}
{"text":"Macayo's is ok , most dishes are well done, but very typical - nothing memorable. One of the few Mexican places that serve chips out of a bag, salsa is below avg. also. Wait staff is almost always amateurish.  Also- why is there always a wait when a third of the tables are open?"}
{"text":"Used to come here years ago before we discovered another  phenomenal Mexican restaurant in the area. This place is awful and I was reminded why I stopped coming here in the first place. Save your money and go to Chipotle instead...that's how mediocre this place is."}
{"text":"Went to Macayo's with my girlfriends to get a drink on a Thursday night and It was awesome! they had live music and the drinks were great. The bartender Joey was great. He served everyone right away when you approach the bar. No one is ever dry on drinks. We asked for some SHOTS and he made us these unbelievable Sweet tarts they were awesome!! Thank you Joey. Will DEFINTELY  go again! HAPPY HOUR!!"}
{"text":"I am not sure why people like this place.  I have tried several locations and have dis-liked them all.  If I don't like a place I don't usually give it a second chance but  because I like to support local businesses and so many people rave about Macayo's I did try several locations.  Everyone says the one off of Mill Ave is good.  But I have wasted enough money at their restaurants.  It boggles my mind how a chain of such low quality can exist.  Any one of the numerous Mexican restaurants usually ending with \"o's\" is better than this place.    The reason they have big margarita's is to distract you from the horrible food and hope after you get over your hangover the margarita is all you remember. Everything I have tasted is bland and seems like it came out of a can.  This chain helps perpetuate the stereotype of Mexican food being of low quality.  I am Mexican-American and used to changing people's mindset when I have them over for dinner.  The only nice quality of this location is the building is unique it looks like a mesoamerican  pyramid."}
{"text":"The bartenders make the party the DJ is great! I'd give it more stars but when you show up on historically a packed night (Halloween Friday) and they don't have a DJ ???  Gonna take my friends somewhere else (apparently management doesn't want money...) HINT: if you're gonna skip on basics for people having a good time, do it on a historically SLOW Friday... #businessowner"}
{"text":"It seems the description that fits Macayo's is \"average\".  I have been here on several occasions, but only for lunch and Happy Hour, and have only eaten in the bar.  It always seems like it is a spur of the moment decision, when I am hungry or thirsty and passing by.  The interior is dark, although they do have a nice patio looking over the parking lot.  The staff is friendly and efficient, and if you have a specific request, they have always provided it.  That said, the food is average, not great, but not bad.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are large.  The chips are above average, and the salsa (the hot one) is delicious. That seems to be why we eat in the bar - they are very free with the chips and salsa.  This is not a destination restaurant for me - but if I am thirsty or am hungry for their chips and salsa, I will stop by for a few drinks."}
{"text":"They're rice was pretty dry, fries tasted old, they're customer service was pretty good. The only thing I like was the salsa."}
{"text":"Food is good for the price. Service is excellent. Our server was really nice to us. We ordered seasonal fish tacos and the original combo. I like my fish tacos although the size of the the fish is big compared to other fish tacos I've tried. I thought I ordered fish n chips. Ambiance: I'm not really impressed. I think they haven't upgraded the place since then. Specially when walking from the entrance. Thought the door will collapse.  But hey, like I said their food is fair for the price."}
{"text":"Good service, a bit weird tasting food. I'm from So Cal where most Mexican food tastes similar. This tastes very different and less than tasty."}
{"text":"I don't normally leave reviews, however due to my experience last night I feel the need. I am a long time lover of Macayo's my family and I have been going there since I was a kid. We stopped going a few years back because their food started lacking and the service was terrible. Once they did the relaunch, changed up the menu a little to give it more of a Cantina feel and cleaned house with the staff, I thought I'd give it another go. I went in with a few girl friends a couple of times, food was great and service was on point. So I decided to bring my family back in this time, and my kids as well. The service last night was AWFUL! Our server claimed he had been in the business for over 25 years. When he said that I thought to myself \"you probably should have reconsidered your profession about 24 years ago.\" He forgot our appetizer until last minute, then probably had it rushed which btw app took almost 25min from the time we ordered it. When I ordered my meal I had asked for a side of jalapeño cream cheese as to which he corrected me with an attitude of what the sauce was called. My bad! After once again waiting for our meal my mother pulled him aside to ask where it was he said that it would be right out and that half of it was sitting in the window, to which I then knew half of our food would be served to us cold, which it was. Both my kids meals were cold to the point I had to ask him to re fire a side of fries. If it weren't for the rest of the food being tasty I would have asked a manager to comp the meal and gotten up and left. I never said anything to a manager other then the mention of the cold fries. I didn't expect nor do I expect anything for this negative review or my horrible experience. The only reason I write this review is purely because I feel the need to let others know that when we are going out and spending our hard earned money on dining out there is a certain expectation for food and service, the service staff needs to be more aware of their customers and the kitchen needs to be more aware of their ticket times. I am very familiar with the restaurant industry and I know if I were the owners and had spent a bunch of money rebranding Macayo's , I would expect my food and staff to go along with my vision. Anything less is unacceptable. Good luck to Macayo's and unfortunately this customer of 30 years will not return!"}
{"text":"Never go here for a family celebration. My family made reservations here for my graduation dinner, but they gave our table away and set us up in the bar instead. At one point they acted like we didn't have a reservation even though we dropped off a cake that morning. This was fine once fixed, but once happy hour started we were pushed out. Literally pushed out and the waiters threw my gifts onto the floor while they were trying to clear the table and get us out. The waitress messed up all of our orders and when we asked for patron margaritas she insisted on giving us house margaritas, which were nasty. The reason she wanted to give us house margaritas was because they were pre made. Horrible graduation dinner."}
{"text":"Great lunch experience here in Central Phoenix.  Macayo's staff was friendly and knowledgeable about their products on their menu.  Julie (bartender) was extremly helpful in helping me decide on a choice.  Definitely recommend this spot and the bar area.  Will come again!"}
{"text":"Good call on 50% seniors night guys...absolutely slammed in there, however service suffers - and for what? To bring in the blue bird special crowd?  I just sat at the bar for the last 15 mins in the hopes of watching some basketball and getting a bite to eat. 15 mins later w not even a menu to look at or a glass of water offered to me by one of the TWO bartenders ...I'm sitting in my car abt to go give my money to someone else   No excuse for this type of service, I've had better Service at Chipotle, actually ...maybe they're still open"}
{"text":"Now I love Mexican food and this please use to be a lot better now it seems more like a chain then a family restaurant but it is the best in my neighborhood until some puts a real Mexican food restaurant here this will have to do."}
{"text":"All around great experience. Me and my brothers came here for dinner on a Monday night, we all enjoyed our food and the service. Our server Martin was awesome. We started with the fried avocado and then had tamales and enchiladas everything was great and authentic tasting. Atmosphere and restaurant were on par with the rest of the experience as well. Very fairly priced. Great experience definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is the worst macayos ever.. I got there and went into the bar area and was told by the bartender to sit WHEREVER WE WANT. we sat in the \"banquet\" area even through there was no sign stating that's what it was. We sat there for about 15 minutes, not offered chips and salsa or drinks. A waitress walked by and got a group of people drinks and everything. After a while I asked a busser if we could get service. She talked to the manager and came and told us \"you didn't get service because yoy were seated in a closed banquet area\", even though that wasn't stated anywhere and I even saw a waitress starring at us as we steated ourselves. I told the busser that it wasn't stated anywhere and the waitress that walked by about 4 times should have said something instead of ignoring us. She said \"well she's paying attention to her tables not you\" the only table I saw her service was the one group of people In the banquet area with us.. at this point I was annoyed and said \"why do you keep putting the blame on us? Like its out fault we didn't get service?! You're so fucking rude\" she then said in a whiny voice \"how am I being rude?\" I walked away and decided to go into the regular eating area and eat because I'm pregnant and was craving macayos.. I talked to the manager and told her what happened, she seemed apologetic but not too worried about it. So we get seated and still had to wait forever for chips and drinks. The manager brought us cheese dip and guacamole.. when we get the check, we were CHARGED for the cheese dip and guacamole. This place is a joke!! I spoke to the manager AGAIN and she said the waiter was supposed to come to her so she can take the charge off. How unprofessional!! I'm never returning to this macayos!!"}
{"text":"Great food and customer service. My family and I have been eating there for years. The food is delicious and always prepared perfectly. The bartender Joey, who has been there for years, is always friendly and always has our orders on point. He's one of the reasons we keep coming back."}
{"text":"Just to tell you guys, that I went with my family a couple of weeks ago, and it took 65minutes to bring our orders on the table!! People that came after us, was already gone!! Nobody showed up, neither the waiter or the manger. I left the restaurant without having dinner that night. After my family was done with the food, my wife told me that she didn't have to pay for my own order, and she got a 20% discount on the dinner. I don't want the discount, I want my frigging food! Too bad that there's not the chance of giving zero star. If not I'd really! Alberto."}
{"text":"The Good: the food was ok, not like the other Macayos I regularly go to in the West Valley.  The Bad: The service was bad from the front of the house to the back. The waiters walked around like they had a ball and chain connect to their ankles and no one was friendly or offered a smile.  Very disappointed as I always favor Macayos:/"}
{"text":"Our food and drinks were really good, but the service was terrible! Our server was nice but we had about 6 different servers walk by our table and look at us without bringing us menus or telling another server to come over. Once we finished eating we sat there for a full 20 minutes before we got our check, and this was after we waived him down. As a server myself I am pretty patient at restaurants but it was honestly ridiculous how much waiting around we had to do when it was not very busy."}
{"text":"If your in the mood for a Mexican meal or a good drink (that you can count on being delicious), this is your spot. We like to eat in the bar area especially if Joey is working. We can always count on Joey to make us laugh while delivering top notch customer service. If you're there on a night when both Joey and Greg are working, be sure to sit at the bar (if there's an open seat) They are hilarious and make you feel at home. It will be you're \"go to\" place for sure."}
{"text":"First visit - last visit.  I spent the last 40 years in NM and find the AZ version of Mexican food to be very bland.  The salsa is very watery, the food is dry, the chips were blah.  But what will keep us from going back is the $6.25 charge for a tiny glass of what they called 'sangria'.  It was white wine with ice and diced fruit in a small wine glass.  Could not have contained more than 2 ounces of wine.  We were never offered a drink menu so we were ordering blind.  My husband and I were astonished.  I mentioned the problem to the hostess as we were leaving and she said.....nothing.  Not one word.  We had a better meal last week at Rubios at about 1/2 the cost - including a great glass of sangria."}
{"text":"I was not overly impressed with this place tonight.  My tamale was ok, the Tostada had a funny taste and too much cheese for my taste.  My hubby liked his Chicken Enchilada's and my daughter said her Quesadilla was ok.  The service was a hit and miss, ok for ordering drinks and food, but took forever to get our check.  Not sure we'll go back."}
{"text":"For being the inventor of the chimichanga it was VERY disappointing. The chimichanga was awful. Huge, but awful. It was soggy and bland. Service was bad despite being the only people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I was warned against it, but I had a coupon and it was close by. This is by far the most Un-Mexican food I have ever tasted. Bland is a complement. Taco Bell has more seasonings. A combo plate which came with a tostada with canned refried beans, some lettuce, and a sprinkling of cheese (completely flavorless), a cheese enchilada, again tasting of canned sauce, and a bone dry shredded beef taco. Not even an onion or piece of cilantro to be found. If you want a place to take your great-grandma who thinks a little black pepper is too spicy, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Happened upon this restaurant while staying at a nearby hotel. We drove by earlier in the day and were first interested in the unique architecture of the building. The decor inside was fun and had an old-school feel. Lots of pink and green, neon lights, mirrors, and wall murals. I loved it!  Went in for dinner a little late, still being on west coast/vacation time, but there were still quite a few people and we weren't rushed at all. Our server was very friendly and helpful when we asked about the menu, even though she needed to check with the kitchen on some of our particular needs.   We started with two margaritas and the Espinaca con queso. Unfortunately it was missing spinach. Hmm... There were some green chiles, however, that added to the cheese dip. I ordered a beef chimichanga with their famous baja sauce. OH how I love this white, creamy, spicy sauce!! Maybe a spicy sour cream? It was delicious! Hubby got steak fajitas which were good, but believe it or not, I was hooked on the grilled onions! They were so flavorful! I'm glad there were a lot on his platter so I could steal more than a few."}
{"text":"I was here the other evening for a meeting (which by the way was set up in the middle of the main dining room, instead of off to one of the side aka quieter areas..making it near impossible to hear anything) and I did not have any of the food, so I will refrain from commenting on what I did see...eh.  I did; however, order a house margarita, and noticed on the menu that it came in two sizes.  I was not asked what size I wanted, just given the larger $2 more size... how clever.  I asked for it with no salt and it came with the most salt I have seen on a margarita EVER!  Ok, fine, whatever.. I wiped it off.. It came with two straws  (so you drink it faster. and order more..HA! I am on to your tricks... no thanks!)  As for the actual taste of the margarita....BLEH... blandest ever.. didn't even really taste like lime or sweet n sour, or the like.. it reminded me of these really gross margarita \"pouches\"  (think Capri Sun) that I bought once while in Cali on vacation... they were so gross that I ended up freezing the rest as ice packs for my cooler!  I am not sure if this margarita had much tequila in it either... so for my $8 I had a goblet of wasted calories....sad.  The service is another low point.. once our servers realized that only 4 of our party of 10 were eating (always a pisser, I speak from experience..but still people) they were pretty much imaginary for the rest of the night.. It took about 10 minutes after I was ready to leave for me to see one of the  servers, and he promptly told me that he couldn't get my check, but as soon as he saw the other server he would let her know.. 5 minutes later she made an appearance... sigh.  I have heard not really great things about this place, and based on my experience I doubt I would go back to give the food a try."}
{"text":"Typical Americanized Mexican food menu. Don't expect a lot of unique items, but do expect a lot of the standards.  Split a green chili cheese crisp to start. Quite tasty. Green chilis were not fresh roasted, but still good.  Chicken fajitas completed the meal. Chicken was good, but not great. The veggies (onions and peppers) were cook well, but did not really have any seasoning. Beans, tortillas, sour cream, and guacamole were good.  Would definitely go back. Especially since they are open late."}
{"text":"While visiting Arizona we were told we must try Macayo's. The margaritas (fruit flavored and blended) were a bit on the sweet side- to the extent that I was worried I might get a tooth ache. The prices here are very reasonable. I had the fajita quesadilla, delicious- I cant stop thinking about it. The service was friendly and somewhat efficient. This isn't a place you go for decor and ambiance- but they do have outside seating, always a plus in my book."}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly.  They messed up my order but she rectified it quickly. My husband had the macayo tour meal and the portions were very small. Also the margaritas were very weak and tasted like water.  Although the staff was very friendly this is not a place I would visit again when I come back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Macayo's is usually the place we go to eat Mexican food in Scottsdale. It's good, serving are large, service is very good. Happy hour is good, full bar. We usually eat in the bar area or outside. I've had the taco salad with chicken, and the burritos, and the chicken chimichanga. All are excellent. You'll like this Mexican place."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a couple of times every week for a few years now. It's across the street from the gym where I play dodgeball. It's convenient and great food, which I can customize if I like. I personally like the bar staff. Joey totally takes care of myself and my co-dodgeballers! We make it a stop for our pregame get to together. We celebrate and have a few drinks/shots together before we all let it at each other throwing those balls at each other! I've been to a few other Macayo's in the valley, which are also good. But I really feel like family at the Macayo's on Central! When I walk in to the bar every week, and Joey sees me I always get a a hey Dale! How's it going with fist bump! It really makes me feel special!   If you like the review and like to get in our Macayo's/Dodgeball family come in on a Tuesday around 5:30pm, we're usually there until 7:00-7:30. You can't miss us! Or you can check out the our website at letsplaydodgeball.com"}
{"text":"Repeat customer for 20+ years...today not so impressed with staff in bar...normally Greg or Joey upbeat very personable...today no bartender to be found (apparently their day off) one server in lounge too busy cleaning tables to even notice we sat for at least 5 minutes with no drinks or salsa while he continued to clean tables around us...decided to move to main restaurant where hostess didn't even care we were waiting and asked if we wanted her to tell her staff we were there lol ... sat with Gely in main restaurant thank her for making my almost horrible experience a plus....great service attentive!!!! Get rid of who is in your bar today!!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I am not from Mexico, so it may not be authentic at all. But hey, it works for me!! The margaritas are great. My husband got me one of those big senorita cups & now we can get those lip smacking margaritas for $3! Can't complain :)  The chips & salsa are great too. Always helps when you are super hungry & want something for a quick fix before the dinner arrives."}
{"text":"I like Macayo's.  Solid happy hour situation - good margs and cold beers.  They also have a $20 carafe & cheese crisp which is a killer deal.  The cheese crisp is essentially a mexican pizza loaded with toppings (bonus to add their house salsa to it) and a carafe of a margarita.  The chicken poblano is also good - think chili relleno with chicken.  Who doesn't love a good poblano pepper stuffed with goodies?  I would say it's solid and affordable Mexican food, but likely won't blow your mind."}
{"text":"Unless you have a few hours of your life you don't mind wasting, DO NOT COME HERE!   My wife and a few friends decided to grab some happy hour food and beverages somewhere. when we arrived and sat down we asked about specials, the waiter replys with \"oh,  um.... $3 draft and wells\". we proceed to ask about food and margarita specials (that the sign behind us clearly states). he tells us \"no\". I then ask him \"Are you Sure? Because that sign over there says differently\". He then says \"i'll check\".   I was right.   strike 1..  After we order a drink we decided on some food. About  15 minutes after we order a group of about 12 or 13 business type people walked in......Well i'm not really sure what happen after this point but everything seemed to go down hill really fast.   Ok..... so i then ask the bartender to change the tv station from CBS News to the football game. (we are the only ones in there besides a person at the bar and the business types in the other room). He does this about 20 minutes after i asked as he obviously forgot until he saw me staring at him. Not too big of a deal.  25 minutes after ordering our appetizers we still have not seen our waiter or any sign of our food. He finally comes over to our table and says \"you're food will be out shortly, our cooks are slacking\" It's completely obvious to us that this guy forgot to put in our order.   Finally our food arrives! It was brought out by another gentlemen who exclaimed \"Sorry about the wait folks, that big party over there (the business types) caught our cooks by suprise!   1. We ordered long before they even came in.  2. Your cooks got caught by surprise??!!!  So, they're not used to cooking when they go to work as a cook!  They got one order completely wrong. our friend who is a vegetarian, ordered the harvest sampler (the veggie sampler). They brought her the regular sampler consisting of beef chimi's burro's and other things. Now we have to wait another 20 minutes for her food.   After comping her meal we received our check. We asked the waiter again if he can split it up 3 ways (we had told him we would be doing this prior to ordering) \"Sure, No problem he says\". He returns 10 mins later only to tell us he can't split the check and we'll have to \"figure it out\"    My wife and the rest of our party except one, proceed to leave and wait for us outside while we \"figure out\" the check.  After deciding we would leave a poor and undeserved tip just to be nice, our waiter brings back our change.. no $1's. before we can open our mouth to remedy this he is gone.   At this point i'm tempted to walk out without leaving a tip but im a nice guy. So i stroll up to the bar to make change. The new bartender makes eye contact with me,  but doesn't say a word, turns around and proceeds to shuffle around the bar as he tries desperately to open a bottle of seagrams with no luck. After 5 minutes and not even a\" i'll be right with you\" or anything i walked out without leaving a tip. i have never done that before. EVER"}
{"text":"Wasn't very busy got seated by hostess. Really excited for the food. Waited 15 mins no one even acknowledged us no water, no chips and salsa not even a hello so we left."}
{"text":"Oh boy....where to begin?  Came here for a holiday party and couldn't wait to leave.  Tacky paint and decor is an understatement.  Picture National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation and the awful casino/restaurant Clark and Eddie go to.  Once we were inside a suggested an immediate trip to the bar to have a shot and kick this thing off.  $8.50 a shot for Patron.  Dinner was upstairs in their \"banquet room\".  Yikes, more tacky paint and their holiday decor was a mixture of semi lit lights, branches of a fir tree, and plastic ornaments.  The food was actually edible and the comedy that was this experience is what earns it the second star.  Do yourself a favor and skip the bathroom.  I'm pretty sure it hasn't been cleaned in years and be careful in the parking lot as there are potholes throughout.  Good luck and remember some Pepto before you go to sleep."}
{"text":"Very slow business. Took waitress at least eight minutes to come to our table, after two people from our party asked where she was. She didn't seem to bright as to where the menus even where or how to get water because we waited at least fifteen minutes for those as well. Overall the service is terrible. It took over half an hour to get our food and then we didn't even get our drink until AFTER we got our food. The food was decent, but it wasn't hot by the time it arrived at our table. We never got refills on our drinks the entire time. After attempting to find our waitress, we asked the bartender if we could pay out and happened to see our waitress and the rest of the waitresses standing up at the host stand chatting away. So unfortunately we won't be dining at this restaurant again. Poor service."}
{"text":"Wanted some mexican that wasn't taco bell. The hotel recommend this place. The restaurant smelled like the inside of a tomato sauce can. I was turned off almost immediately. I decided to sit on the patio and try it out anyway.  I ordered the Chipotle BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad with a light cilantro lime dressing. It was okay. The chips and salsa were okay too, nothing to brag about. The salsa tasted like it came from a can. I'm happy I ordered a salad. The redeeming factors were the Arizona Sunset Margarita and the good service. I think once restaurants turn into chains, they seem to lose their original character."}
{"text":"My last night in AZ I thought it'd be good to attempt to get good Mexican food again. While this was definitely a step up from the last place Los Sombreros or whatever, it was pretty standard (definitely better than many E. Coast options, though). We started off with some chips and salsa - what better way to whet an appetite while filling yourself up before you get your food so you realize you ordered too much after it's too late? (always the case w/Mexican!) The salsa was pretty tasty, so a plus there.   Dad and I went ala carte; he got a cheese enchilada and I got a tamale with 'lite' white sauce. FYI 'lite' still means 'brick of fat melted on your tamale'. It was good, but I felt like I was eating...a brick of fat. We also got a large order of guac which was a mistake, we were way too full by the time everything came out!  The margaritas were ok. I thought mine was pretty sour, and my dad got this kind with a lot of juice in it so it kind of tasted weird. They were also retardedly huge. Unnecessary to waste that much liquid!! We could only finish half.   Our bill was fine although it was doubled by the cost of the drinks, booo.   Would come back to a place like this if I needed a hangover fix, but otherwise....meh."}
{"text":"Went last night. Party of 7. No parking available. Had to park in lot across the way. This was a Sunday.  Surprisingly quite a few tables still open despite a full parking lot. Margaritas were weak. My tacos were cold. My daughter's tacos also cold. My wife's tacos arrived after almost everyone had finished eating. They were also cold. They didn't finish their meals. The other entrees were good. At least they were on hot plates. Draft beer (Kiltlifter) was local and good. Service was quite good. The waitress was working exceptionally hard. Understaffed? Prices would be fair except for the food prep. Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"The good: Great service, nice decor in the seating area, very colorful n peppy place, okay food.   The average: I won't call anything bad here but certainly average. I found the food not too flavorful and more saucy than I have had at other mexican places. They serve nice hot chips and salsa complimentary but again the salsa was bit less spicy for my liking.   The fajita had big thick slices of veggies like squash n zuchinni - too thick to wrap in tortillas, not grilled well n not seasoned enough.   All in all, good place to catch a few drinks and appetizers but not so much for a tasty hearty meal."}
{"text":"Love there food and are server Julie was awesome.I live in Prescott and every time I come to the Valley we stop in"}
{"text":"I've always liked Macayos. My folks and I used to go to the one in Tucson. Good times and food as always!"}
{"text":"Why on Earth would somebody change what works? The decor has lost the sense of excitement that the old Mexican style created. The menu is now fru fru. They must have hired a chef who couldn't make it anywhere else and allowed him to destroy what the restaurant had been known for. Regarding being able to order off of the old menu, one is only presented with the \"new improved\" menu. I've gone back several times trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but they never fail to disappoint me. Even the quality of the traditional foods has decreased. I guess you get the idea that I'm unhappy with the Scottsdale Macayo's."}
{"text":"Meh. There's a lot of great Mexican restaurants in Arizona. This one falls into the Mexi-American category which isn't a bad thing unless you love authentic Mexican food. Even the guacamole here left something to be desired. Still, the servers are always friendly and it's a fun environment. I love the interior booths and the wall decorations."}
{"text":"I've been to Macayo's once before a couple years ago, and it used to be a lot better. I went on a saturday night at around 8 o'clock, and there was no one there, kind of odd. We all had margaritas, which were pretty good. The food was over-priced for what you got, since it was pretty mediocre. I ordered the same thing I did last time I came and I remember it being way better before, I think they changed the recipe, bad decision. Overall, I probably would not come back here again, unless they lowered their prices."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Friday night about a week ago.  Place was busy but we were seated in just a few minutes.  The good - service was great. The bad -   the Chimichanga de Macayo tasted as if it was a frozen mexican dinner and the salad was a bunch of shredded lettuce with little else.  Will look for a different restaurant if the urge for Mexican food strikes again."}
{"text":"Shout outs to my man Greg at the bar who has always taken care of me and my friends every single time we come in. The staff is great and Greg is on point all day everyday! Quick service and friendly! Tempe food is great but the staff makes this place one of a kind!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we've eaten here and the food and margaritas have been delicious both times. What made our mother's day visit particularly special is Heather. From the time she greeted us at the door, she was warm and very helpful. All special requests were remembered and delivered promptly and she managed to be both super friendly without being intrusive. Just a wonderful experience. If you haven't tried this Scottsdale Macayo yet we highly recommend you do!"}
{"text":"Spinach and cheese con queso is wonderful as are their Tanga quesadillas. I have never had anything bad there I love their chips and salsa. Margaritas have too much lime juice  or whatever they're sweet sour mix is for me and not enough tequila. I don't waste my calories on those but I enjoy the Dos Equis cold beer"}
{"text":"We had a planned retirement party here on a weekday during lunch. We were a crowd of 12-20 and as we stepped in , we are guided to our tables and the staff got prompt response through out. They came up with the fresh tortilla chips and salsa on our tables with the menu card to place the order.  They got very few lunch specials on their cards but the main menu is pretty big. However the quantities they serve is sufficient . Their fried avocado is a must try for the vegetarians .I would give the stars for their staff, interiors and plate presentation(not as messy as few Mexican restaurents).Over all it is nice experience and would recommend."}
{"text":"Their food is generic, edible, nothing to get all excited about considering the choices you have in Phoenix, HOWEVER, they have a great happy on Fridays. Wednesday night Karaoke was a blast . . .always have a good time here. That gets the three stars!"}
{"text":"There was a time when I was a regular here. Not anymore! Once again, I end up with a terrible server. This is the closest place for me to meet my daughters and grandchildren for lunch as I work nearby. But, once I again I had to leave and have my lunch packed to go. The server was rude and very obviously frazzled. This place has a serious staffing problem. I just don't understand why they can't get pleasant and qualified staff."}
{"text":"Oh...Macayos.  A once Phoenix staple has turned into complete and utter crap.  I spent many a high school evenings dining here after debate practices and I believe El Presidente Obama ate here within the past few years.    Things have taken a big turn for the worse.  I mean, you shouldn't expect much with their cheesy decor and a customer base similar to that of Wal-Mart, but it used to be decent - and edible.    Their menu got smaller.  Its hard to find anything under $11.  The food (even the side of veggies) was SOOO greasy and fatty. Seriously - I feel like I need to eat salads for the next 2 days to compensate for the calorie content of that dish. The baja sauce lost its kick.  The guac had no flavor. I regret eating here."}
{"text":"Horrible service!  I never received some items ordered and asked 3 times for those items and still never received them however they had the audacity to try to charge me for it!   The food we did receive was greasy and I would not recommend it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Came in for lunch, Julie the bartender was awesome! Food is great as always had the woodys special, tostado taco enchilada !   If you get a chance you should really try this place!"}
{"text":"I've frequented this restaurant many times for work-related, team building-type lunches so the times I've been here are with my co-workers and it's during lunch.  So that means it's super busy cause everyone else is on their lunch and we're all trying to eat lunch within an hour.  With that said, I've always experienced great waiters and waitresses who are aware of the time constraints and manage to get lunch served in a decent amount of time.    The quality of the food is fair especially since I only order off of the \"Lunch\" menu.  However, yesterday I realized I hardly got any meat on my plate and a lot of rice and a lot of beans.  Maybe they're trying to cut corners by skimping out on the portions?  Who knows?  But the place is old - needs new furniture, carpet, etc.  With all the new \"hipster\" places nearby, they really need to step their game up.  Anyway, I heard their happy hours are crackin' so I'm leaving it at 3-stars until I've had a drink or two to sway my opinion to state otherwise!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant  in late October. I had fried avocados as an appetizer (something new for me) and they were amazing. We tried the fried ice cream for desert, it was tasty. The other items ordered were OK not bad, but not great.  I'd try another Mexican restaurant if ever in Phoenix area again."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner tonight.  It's been a long time since I've been there and it seems to have gone downhill.  Positives: 1.  Food was ok.  Negatives 1.  Service was terrible.   Some examples ... We asked our waiter Ted for water with lemon, he brought water.  We reminded him by asking for lemon. Then he brought my beer ... no lemon this trip.  More minutes pass.  My wife has finished her first glass of water.  Now he brings some lemon.  We're finishing up eating and he brings us our bill.  He says it's wrong (I had the .$99 tacos, they charged $8.98) but says he'll correct it when we pay.  We waited at least another 10 minutes and never saw him.  I finally walked up to the front, the manager corrected the bill and Ted brought a box for my wife's leftovers. 2.  Decor - This was a very unique restaurant with a Mayan look and nice decor.  Seats are torn.    As we were leaving our waiter told us they were moving, but could not tell us where.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Terrible and RUDE STAFF. Something as basic as an enchilada was disgusting. Food tastes pre-made. My waiter was extremely rude from the moment i walked in. I have never been treated so poorly at an establishment. Waste of money and time."}
{"text":"Walked in and no host at front desk. We seated ourself in the bar area and after watching the bartender ask the waitress 3 times if she'd set us up yet we moved to the bar counter. Got same gal to wait on us. The first thing the gal says is \"well it's a Sunday\". There were two tables with two people each in the whole place. Ordered pork shoulder enchiladas and chicken tacitos. Got two dry enchiladas on a plate and small bowl with both rice and beans in it. That cost $13. Tacitos were burnt to a dark brown. Have been to the one in Casa Grande and had no problems with food or service. Don't even bother with this one."}
{"text":"So I dont live in Phoenix but I have family out here so I visit when I can and when I do I ALWAYS make sure I stop at Macayo's it is soooooo DELICIOUS! I love their Baja sauce - its like a cream cheese jalapeno juice concotion of blissfull deliciousness and this time I got the \"California\" burro which being from CA I thought would have Carne Asada and Fries but did not instead it was fillled with beans and guacamole sour cream cheese and pico on the side with an opt in of Chicken for a dollar more and it was so very good I would reccomend it highly!  Any time you are in the Phoenix area please make a stop to Macayo's it will certainly be worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Why is it so hard for food establishments to provide VEGAN, not just vegetarian options?  More than one of every hundred people in the US over 18 years old is a VEGAN - which means no animal products.  The number is growing exponentially.  Its not difficult to please us - just provide a couple of options for the main dish, such as baked beans or a vegan burger.  Come on even burger king and subway have them.  Thank you.  Arlene"}
{"text":"It was our first time to this place & we were seated immediately. We choose to sit at the bar.Since we are vegetarians we order veg. fajitas & veg. tacos. They were awesome & exceed our expectation.   We will visit again. Good job!!"}
{"text":"If you're ordering drinks, I'd suggest sticking to beer rather than the weak margaritas. The food, however, is the main attraction and it is outstanding. The chimis are probably the best item on the menu, but if you're looking to not eat something so filling, try the chicken flautas.  Parking is in the back and the restaurant is also right off the light rail."}
{"text":"Our waitress   is great, Very interactive and fun! She made our visit awesome. Great guest service! food was mediocre had enchilada"}
{"text":"I managed to fish the first bug out of my margarita, but when I saw the second one floating there, enjoying my much anticipated beverage, it had to go back.  Don't get me wrong, I appreciated the fact that they added a free protein boost to my drink, but I like to enjoy my margaritas on my own, thank you very much.  There's something that's just not right about this place.  The service is very friendly, but my menu was wet and smelled like someone had tossed their cookies right on it.  My friend's nachos just tasted...funky and the vegetables that came with my bean and cheese burro were so dry, they were cracked.  Combine that with the fact that everything tasted oddly like cardboard and I was feeling like I was on an episode of Kitchen Nightmares.  I'd say that maybe this place is great when you're hammered, but yeah, I really wouldn't want to be there then either."}
{"text":"By far the worst Mexican food I've ever had.  Not much flavor, runny beans, gross appearance and taste.  I won't go back.  Wondering how it's stayed in business for so long.  There are many other Mexican restaurants in town.  Try them instead of this one!!  Best Mexican the Canadians have ever had, maybe.  One word review. Yuck?"}
{"text":"Real good spot for lunch located in Central Phoenix, friendly staff, great lunch specials, Julie the bartender provided great service, friendly and outgoing - highly recommended ask for Julie"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood eatery that has been here for years. The staff is always friendly and courteous. Canaan was terrific and didn't mind that we got a table for some dessert and a coffee the other night. The band sounded fun and may go back to party one of these nights."}
{"text":"This place cannot get it together.... we walked out 5 Years ago.... went back for the new Remodel....... nice place, the Service is TERRIBLE~!!!  Had to ask for a glass of ice twice, salt and pepper shakers, Server seemed tooooo busy to wait on us....(we were the only ones there) and it was 5:00 on a Monday.... Too bad, it is a neighbor place with pretty good food.....Just have Amateurs working there.... with brown TShirts and Jeans????? Its gonna be another 5 Years~!!!!! By the way, the Manager is a complete IDIOT!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times. Food quality is good, good service. Would have been 4 stars, but the portions are a little small..."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times over the year and on my most recent visit I noticed that the food and service have really gone downhill.  Macayo's claim to fame is that it's founder, Woody Johnson, invented the chimichanga by accidentally dropping a burrito into the deep frier. However, as any good Arizonan knows, this claim is challenged by El Charro restaurant in Tucson where they also claim to have invented the dish in the same year.  Either way, you'd think that a restaurant that wants to lay claim to such an important event in food history would make an effort to maintain its reputation as a quality Mexican restaurant, but this doesn't seem to be the case.  We stopped in the other night and started with some cheese quesadillas for us and the kids and they were incredibly bland and boring.   For a main course, my wife had the steak picado and I had the green chile chicken picado. My dish is described on the menu as \"tender chunks of marinated chicken sauteed in a fiery blend of tomatillo salsa, strips of poblano chiles and habanero\". Nowhere does it say, cooked beyond recognition so that the chicken tastes like dry pieces of cardboard.  My wife's steak picado was not tender, but tough.  Additionally, our service was inattentive when it occurred and non-existent at other times. I never received the sour cream I requested and once the food was at our table and the waitress had left behind a pitcher of water so we could do our own refills, we didn't see her again despite the fact that several members of our party had ice tea and could have used refills.  In a city and state full of GOOD Mexican restaurants, you'd think that Macayo's would try harder to compete, but I guess not. If it's my choice, I won't be back."}
{"text":"We came in after a spring training game and sat at the bar which had 4 other people. There was no bartender at the bar, however there was a waitress serving the tables behind us. We sat at the bar for 6 minutes (after I started timing it) with no service.  When the bartender did finally show his face, there wasn't an apology or any urgency to take our order. We finally ordered drinks and food, both of which were good.  During our meal, another lady sat next to us and the bartender was chatting with what I assume was a friend on the other side of us. She also waited at least 7 minutes before he acknowledged her. While the food is good, the service was horrible."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Macayo 's for 30+ years, when I lived in Phx and when I moved to California. this was undoubtly the worse service and mediocre food I've had here. what a disappointment to come from California, and run in to the worse service I've had in a long time.  Ordered drinks, they tasted like \"virgin\" margarita's, one drink was not made to order, 10 minutes to get a replacement and still lousy.   Two food order's out of four are done wrong. Waitress didn't seem to understand what was wanted, then argued about menu vs order.  I won't be going back, there are too many other mexican places with great ratings on Yelp to try before going back to Macayo's."}
{"text":"Our first time at this location and everything was GREAT. My husband and I decided to go out for a late dinner. Thank you to our server Carlos for making sure our chips and salsa were constantly refilled and for bringing our food out promptly. Great service and food!"}
{"text":"Happy hour was really good.  Free and tasty appetizer type foods in the cantina and good drink prices."}
{"text":"Mark, the Manager took my order over the phone... It was for 2 separate doctors offices.  He made sure the order was complete and packed separately.  Order & food was perfect & delish... And, I did not have to pay for extra chips and salsa, like some places make you do!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! I highly recommend the desert pear and elderflower margarita. :)"}
{"text":"The food was really good. Especially the carnitas enchilada. Chips are good and fresh. I have to give three stars because the server waited twenty minutes to take our food order after we waited a long time for drinks already. Then the food took forever when there were only three tables in service!! Forever as in longer than thirty minutes, so while I don't usually eat the chips I didn't have a choice. The chef is very attentive to your allergies I must add. Eat here on a day when you are on serious chill. Oh yeah -- great top shelf margaritas!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my friends has been eating at this location for years and highly recommended it - I can see why.  Our waitperson (Esperanza) was the best waitperson I have ever had at any restaurant, ever (and several of us made sure to tell the manager)!  She worked very hard to make sure our large party was 100% satisfied.  And, since I was a first timer, she brought all of our table a free appetizer (3 sets of appetizers) - wow.  And the food, absolutely some of the best I have tasted.  The only thing I didn't care for was the salsas (sorry Macayo's) - for whatever reason, I just didn't like them.  I had the chile relleno and enchiladas - perfection!  The rice and beans are fabulous.  I loved this place and hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"I am so dissapointed in this Macayo's! I want to love it because they have a great street taco special on Thursdays (and it is within walking distance from my house) but service in their bar area does NOT exist! We went there twice and waited for at least 10 minutes before even being greeted by a server. Staff looked at us and most tables around us had food and drinks but for some reason both times we had lousy service. One of my friends with us made two trips to the bar to get drinks before our waiter brought our first one we ordered!  I won't return."}
{"text":"Poor service and very poor food. Chicken in the fajitas tasted expired. Would never eat here again."}
{"text":"I was there on the 7th, for a birthday party for my brother with my husband, sons, their wives, my grandbabies and a couple of friends....I have food allergies and Jana (not sure how to spell it), the manager, was AMAAAAZING!  She had them make me special chips, helped me choose a main dish I would be safe with and because they were out of cider, I was able to have a margarita.  :)  With only one mess up at our whole table of like 12 people, which she took care of, the meal, the service and the night was fantastic!  I am so thankful I called before, and got her on the phone, she is most certainly an asset and I felt cared for as a customer. I always hate being the awkward one at the table and I was far from it that night. I will be sure to return, as I am very very limited at Mexican restaurants and this experience was awesome!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Overpriced food, sucky service, and they take a tip out without you choosing the amount."}
{"text":"We were here for a family gathering.  They set us up in a nice room. The chips were good but the salsa was very bland and watery.  I got the a chimi which is a signature dish. The beef was ok but really didn't care for the cheese sauce. The rest   of my family said their food was just ok. I really expected it to be better."}
{"text":"I went with my friend in December and was throughly disappointed with the food and the service. We were seated in the bar. We ordered tea and lemonade.  We were there for lunch and didn't mind sitting in the bar. The silverware was worse than chinet silverware, more like what you get at a buffet. I ordered a steak taco salad & I couldn't cut the meat with the funky knife so I asked the server for a real knife to cut the meat. Someone came over to ask how our meal was, I told him it was hard to cut the meat and I was told the meat had been cut wrong, and he took my meal off the bill. On our way out we went to the restroom, it smelled like sewer gas and there were no hooks on the stalls and I dreaded putting my purse on the floor. This is not the Macayos I remember and I'm afraid I'll never return. I'm a long time Arizonan and it's sad to see how the quality of this restaurant had gone downhill. I believe the location is one of the reasons it continues to keep open because otherwise it wouldn't last with the ambivalent server and quality of the food."}
{"text":"I thought I didn't like Macayo's. Typically, I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, and because of the heavy Hispanic/Chicano population in the Southwest, we have a multitude of Mexican restaurants to choose from.  But it was good. I went with a group of friends recently. I monkey see-monkey do-'ed and ordered what my friend ordered. The cheese enchilada was tasty, and the beef tamale with baja sauce. Oh yes. Das ist gut. I mean, muy bien.   I went again a little over a month ago with a dear friend during lunch, and it was even better than the last time. We were cozied in a booth in the back, with a darling older blonde lady as our waitress. She was chatty and pleasant. My friend ordered a margarita in one of the fancy mugs for him to take back to Utah. I ordered a conconutty margarita, which was mighty tasty with lots of coconut on the rim and in the drink, as well as a hefty chunk of pineapple inside, as well. Excellent!  The waitress was attentive but respected our space. The chips and salsa were uber fresh. They were so good, I could have come just for chips and salsa + a margarita. The food came very quickly, piping hot and the presentation was just so. Our lovely lady loaded us up with napkins (not gonna lie, I am a napkin hog), and we got to it. I ordered the tamale with baja sauce, and it was heavenly. We took our time to eat and sat in the booth with our food babies for awhile after we finished. The food was great and it was a nice experience. Looks like I need to chill on my chain restaurant snobbery, because I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"First of all there's a police substation in the lobby now. So, as you're waiting to be seated you are oogled by the police officers. Unfortunately this is not just a momentary bad vibe, it's the theme for the evening. the dining area is reminiscent of a Warsaw gulag with the owner of the restaurant and busboys literally standing watch and making patrols as if they were prison guards , all this in me pursuit of preventing people from stealing dinner? Meanwhile the service was terrible, we came thirsty and eager to drink and eat and left thirsty. We only saw our waiter perhaps 5 times the entire evening. The only positive thing there was to say about the entire evening was the food was average. There was nothing really negative one can say about the food."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Macayos I ate lunch in the cantina (bar) area.  Greg was quick and efficient not only taking my order but serving it as well.  On top of that he brought yummy chips and salsa (who doesn't love chips and salsa?) I was in and out in less than an hour, which is great during a lunch break.  Prior to leaving Greg mentioned they had some great happy hour deals and to come by, so I showed up on Friday night to see what it was all about. Let me just tell you it was not what I was expecting....I mean, how good can a happy hour/bar really be in a restaurant?  I was skeptical to say the least.    One word....awesome!  Do not be fooled by the exterior or the thought that a restaurant cannot have a great bar.  Joey and Greg are amazing bartenders that are not only skilled in their craft but are highly personable while doing it.  They have incredible drink specials and a fantastic DJ who takes requests and will play anything you want to dance to (yes, that includes salsa, hip hop, oldies, plus more).  It seems that everyone who goes to Macayos on Friday nights is there to have a couple delicious drinks, dance and have an all around good time.    Whether you are just visiting the valley or a long time resident, if you have not been to Macayos on Central you need to check it out!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Friendly servers, but very very slow service.  It's a good thing they give you chips and salsa up front while they prepare your food otherwise you would starve to death."}
{"text":"Excellence. ...ask for Gregory...he will hook you up at the bar him....celebrating my girlfriend Barbara's bday...great jazz music on Thursday night."}
{"text":"Server (Julianna) was friendly and took good care of us (party of 10)..... We mainly had drinks but she did a good job keeping tabs!  But... The place itself needs to be remodeled. It's a dump. I always thought it was closed based on outside apperances. But inside is really outdated, restrooms are small and stingy looking. The place smells odd..... & it's dark. A friend ordered something, I tried a bite and was NOT impressed.   Definately won't go back unless dragged by friends like today."}
{"text":"Dear God and Baby Jesus, I love Macayo's Crunchy Chicken Tacos.   One of my most favorite things to do when I come to Phoenix is to eat my most favorite tacos.   They were amazing as always. I don't know what they do to their chicken but its magical. There isn't enough good things I can say about them.   There was a slight disappointment when I found out that they don't have any other custom drinks besides margaritas. I'm not a big fan of tequila so I was bummed not to see some other options available.   The bar can make what ever drinks you want but no specialties from their end.   I went with the Pomegranate Margarita. It was better than I thought it would be but not exactly what I wanted.   I also love their salsa. Fresh cilantro is always a must for me. It could be the most boring salsa and when you add a little cilantro it takes on a whole new life.   Sorry Tam, I didn't get the Cheese Crisp. There was only room for two tacos and some rice and beans in my tummy.   It was so good. These tacos haunt my dreams."}
{"text":"MUCHO NASTY.  I love great Mexican food, gone here +- years ago.  My waiter was attentive, polite and knowledgeable.  First my wife's Margarita had almost NO Tequila and almost no ice.  manager jazzed it up but VERY little.   The chips were decent but the salsa's  were runny and flavorless.  Ordered a cheese crisp it came to the table cold, ate 30%, sent it back.  Wife ordered the beef tamales  and they were the funkiest color and  most un-mexican she has ever had and she makes tamales.  The rice was HARD.  I ordered a chile relleno  with black beans.  The order came with hard rice, and refried beans (WRONG) and a relleno with 1/4 of a chili \"honest\" 1/4 ( 2\" X 2\")  the rest was batter and lots of it (6x6).  What a disappointment for $51.00. Dont get me wrong I made my choice to go there but an establishment has the responsibility to provide a quality product for the price they ask, $51 isnt chump change, I will spend 4 times that for a good meal.  From now on I go back to my mainstays Barrio Cafe, Richardson's Cuisine of Mexico, SOL, Cantina Laredo, The Mission, La Hacienda.  Macayos, why would bother put put out a product so poor when the competition is so keen, in the 80's your product was great.  Maybe times have left you behind.  .I really wish you well, retool."}
{"text":"Two words, BABY ROACH..... yes I said it.. and it's true and I hate to because I've know of Macayo's in it's better days, but they've gone down hill. I've only got the steak fajitas here. Every-time I walk in seems like the front-desk is f'ing off somewhere, but at least when they show up we get seated right then. Never waited very long, 1st steak fajitas seems fine. 2nd time the steak a little undercooked, but I didn't complain (I sometimes have my steaks medium rare), 3rd time they served me all onions and no bell peppers with my steak, my Wife's meal didn't come a listed on the menu and about 10 seconds after they brought out an additional plate tortillas I saw a baby roach walking on the table. I secretly squished it (with a napkin) and never told my Wife or she would have thrown up..... We left immediately... True story."}
{"text":"I went in yesterday for happy hour to have a birthday drink. I had the house margarita for $5.75. Actually I had two! They were good. I think I disappointed the bartender when I question him why his $7.25 Margarita he was pushing was supposedly so awesome. He claimed Cruz a local Tequila was the reason. I argued just because it's local doesn't make it good. LOL.   The house Rita stands up alone, as a good traditional Rita on the rocks. Don't buy the hype, as I saw half the crowd not question it and accept the pricier one on special as the way to go.   The place was busy. They were also hosting a MBA networking mixer just off the main bar. In addition to discounted beer at happy hour they also offered free food! I thought those days were gone but they kept a steady supply of warm chips, salsa, veggie tray, cold pinwheel wraps and one or two hot Mexican items (mini chimis, and bean & cheese nachos) coming. I was going to order a half price appetizer as part of my happy hour, but heck I went for the free food and was just fine.   My sampling of the appetizers makes me wonder how good the menu was, so I peeked at it. It looks pretty basic but tasty. I think everything was $12 or less on the dinner menu. According to the sign outside lunch starts at $5.99.  It may be commercialized Mexican food but it's a step up from some places like Taco Bell and Baja Express for certain.  The staff seemed competent and to work rather well together. Even though it was busy the staff was calm and quick to serve, which is a good thing. They seem to recognize some customers as regular patrons which was also nice.   The woman's room off the bar was fresh and clean in this madness as was the bar and all areas I could see.   I think I will be back. I think I could even become a fan of the place over time. It seems to have a good mix of people and an impressive straight male clientele, worth another look."}
{"text":"New to Nevada from California, we are trying to establish new restaurant favorites.  We started with Macayo's on Charleston for Mexican food just because we were shopping in that plaza. We asked several people how it was and only one person said it was good. Highly disappointing after we tried it, and we crossed it off our list!   I usually judge the food by two things:  The salsa, and chile verde. If these are good, the menu is good.  The salsa was crap and there was no chile verde.  They had something like it but the waitress said it's made with beef instead. What?  I agree with the other 1 star reviews."}
{"text":"Another disaster on the start of my evening. I rarely ever have issues with service or bother to complain on Yelp, but this waiter with glasses and a touch of gray hair was ignorant. He muffed one of the orders even after we had told him multiple times what we wanted. The dish came out way wrong as predicted. He also didn't answer my standard white meat chicken question, instead choosing to tell us how even if the meat is mixed, it is usually good at other places. Uhh WTF? The chips were stale and my tamale I ordered was inedible. After a short chat with the waiter, he agree to send manager over, but manager was too lazy to visit table. On the good side, the manager did tell us to leave without paying for our drinks ($16), so we got the best deal out of a bizarre dining experience. Avoid that waiter."}
{"text":"Baja chimi... yum!!!"}
{"text":"Was excited when I moved here from Vegas to find a Macayos.  Easily the best smooth salsa around.  I will say while they get four stars for the salsa I prefer the food of the restaurants overall in Vegas.  Menus are slightly different here in AZ."}
{"text":"Macayo's is \"greasy spoon\" Mexican food at its finest! It's certainly not the best I've ever had, but not the worst either. I think their lunch specials are good and the happy hour is a deal!!!  CHIMI FIESTA!  Chimichanga de Macayo $6.99 Chicken or Beef Chimichanga covered with relleno sauce & sour cream. Side of rice or beans.   Dos Equis XX draft for just $3.75  Upon being seated, enjoy the complimentary tortilla chips. Comes with salsa, queso and bean dip. Great starter!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for buffet style going away lunch celebrations. The food is OK and the service can really vary. Other people I know complained of slight sickness after eating. That hasn't happened to me."}
{"text":"Food is ok but not such a good value for the price.  Drinks are expensive.  Service is awful.  Slow, got the orders mixed up, the bills were mixed up,  the server was unprofessional (rude, calling women \"darlin\" - how tacky).  Watch out when they add 18% service on a big party - on our bill it said 18% but the math came out to more like 30%.  The decor is just awful.  There are lots better places to eat."}
{"text":"I went here last night with a good friend of mine for the first time.  We both were in search of a restaurant that was open on the later side on New Year's Day and this happened to work out for us.  The building itself is like an Aztec or Mayan pyramid and hard to miss since it kind of sticks out - but I guess you could say it adds to the character of the place.  Overall the decor is a bit dated, but clean and honestly for the type of restaurant it is, it's acceptable.  We were greeted warmly and seated right away to a booth where we both decided to indulge in their margarita special for the evening which was an upgrade from the house.  I was surprised how large they were and tasted great.  I enjoyed the fact that they didn't taste watered down at all and were a bit more on the savory side versus tasting ultra sugary.  The chips and salsa were a nice touch since many places now don't seem to offer complementary items like that anymore.  The chips were perfectly crisp, not overly salty or thick.  The salsa lacked a bit of pizazz, but tasty none the less.  He ordered the Chimichanga de Macayo and I tried the Sonoran Enchilada Sampler.  Both were delicious and well seasoned.  The chiles in the enchiladas really brought out a nice rounded flavor.  Their rice was flavorful and not overcooked which seems to be a common issue for many restaurants I have tried.  For dessert, we shared the fried ice cream with chocolate sauce; I never had it previously, but it was tasty.  The crust wasn't quite as crispy as I had anticipated, but did have a nice little crunch to it.  In general, our visit to Macayo's was a pleasant one.  The service was great - our waiter was very accommodating, helpful and attentive.  We enjoyed our meal very much and I can't wait to go back and try out a couple of other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"The food here is your average American-Mexican food.   There are always Chips and salsa. If you're lucky enough to get a fresh batch they are wonderful.  I love that they don't cake them with salt.   The food is consistent and spicy. Their carne asada is my favorite.   But the reason we continue to visit is a certain waiter named Kevin. He is exceptional. Upbeat, enthused and never ever let's a cup run dry. He makes you feel special and continues to provide excellent service. He deserves a raise."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic the service was above reproach and it's so sad to see the restaurant closing down. Absolutely fantastic atmosphere had a great time looking forward to going to a different location :)"}
{"text":"Good food!  My friend and I came here Saturday night after the Mercury game and I'm so glad we did. I have never been to this location either so it was a treat for me.  We both ordered a burrito and they were really good.  I'd go back to this location or any other Macayo's. I'm only giving it 3 stars because other than the food, I wasn't particularly \"wowed.\""}
{"text":"Dirty place with horrible food.  Two steps below frozen ... Went on a Saturday night and you just look around and you see the slop everywhere.  The floors are dirty, the restrooms are dirty and the tables are dirty.  The food is terrible.  I called over our ditzy server and asked her to take my wife's meal off the bill.  The margerita was served in a plastic cup that looked like something you would find at a roadside eatery in the 1970's ... Just very poor in every respect ... Try Manual's over by the 101 in Scottsdale for really nice Mexican food."}
{"text":"Up until today I have really liked this place and have been coming here for years,but after this last experience I will be looking to do my business lunches and business elsewhere. The general manager is extremely rude and does not fit in the customer service industry. Macayos has really gone downhill."}
{"text":"Its funky looking building made me wonder if it's open or closed (no windows and entrance door is hidden behind a large pillar).  Inside is a cute family-owned restaurant.  It would be perfect for family dinner.  I ordered Fiesta salad with steak from lunch menu.  After I ordered, I realized that I was not asked how I wanted the steak to be cooked.  Well, I am a medium/rare person but it came out almost well done.  This was a bit of setback for me, but their salsa was sooooo delicious.  They put a lot of garlic in it and you know garlic makes everything delicious.  I recommend everybody should try this restaurant at least once."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here. Great food, great service, great atmosphere! Definitely will be back. Amanda was our server and she was sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"The only thing clean is the restroom  The food is disgusting The service is just downright mean.   I would discourage anyone from going there."}
{"text":"This is the Very first Macayo's. Always good food!  We love the chips and salsa, especially with a good cup of coffee!  The food is always good, we are not much of drinkers but, we hear the drinks are strong and good. You can order almost anything you want. Even if it is not on the menu.  Their BaJA Sause is fantastic! Lots of really good choices.  If you are craving Mexican this is the place."}
{"text":"Our server, Lindsay was UNBELIEVABLY disrespectful and rude. She messed up our order and when we asked her to fix it, she rolled her eyes at us. She slammed our meals down on our table. I don't think we'll be returning."}
{"text":"After reading a few of the reviews written about this place I decided to share my thoughts on this Mexican chain food destination. I have lived here all my life and never took the time to stop in until one day my buddy and I missed the bus and were looking for a place to escape the heat. The one thing about this location that always made me want to try it was the shape of the building.   It always reminded me of one of the Mayan pyramids built in Mexico. Anyways when you first walk in they have the usual set up, bar on one side with a few tables and a full dining section for the dinner and lunch crowd. We were seated right away and given a quick run down of everything half off(happy hour pricing). The beer selection is pretty standard and the price for a pitcher was kind of high as well but my friend was happy with having it all for himself since I do not drink.  The bite size tamale bites were good and the Steak Cortez was great as well. The only thing I would recommend is going before or after happy hour as it can get really crowed and it is hard to find a place to sit unless you are just having lunch or dinner. Also it can be hard to enjoy a meal with the loud sounds of people screaming at the T.V. as the dining area is really close to the bar area. Other than that I suggest stopping in the next time you are in the area. If nothing else you can take a cool picture in front of the building LOL."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Macayos in years. It's really nice inside and outside. Our waitress, Cathy, was super nice and friendly. Chips and salsa were great but I wish they had more choices for iced tea. The food hits the spot for that Mexican craving and there are lots of options."}
{"text":"I'm from Vegas, and growing up we used to visit MacAyo ALL of the time. It was amazingly good mexican food. On a trip to Scottsdale over the summer, my mom insisted we give it a whirl.   I thought it was very basic, quick, chain mexican food. Not horrible, Not great. It was decent, especially considering it's pretty cheap. The manager said the one in Vegas is a lot different than the one in Scottsdale.   Next time, I will definitely go somewhere else, somewhere more authentic."}
{"text":"If you like waiting for 15 minutes for water or even chips and salsa this is the place to go! We walked in and the hostess was NOWHERE to be found (red flag number one) she FINALLY came out from the back to seat us in a very empty place in the dining area. We waited for about 15 minutes with absolutely no service. My husband and I got up and headed for the front door. Again she (hostess) was nowhere to be found. My husband wanted to talk to the manger to let him/her know how long we waited without service. I actually had to go find the hostess and ask for the manger myself. She just looked at me and said, \"Yeah sure\" and then walked away. Clearly she doesn't get paid enough to care about customer service. In any event, I walked back to the front and waited to meet with the manger when a few more customers walked in. We told them how long we had to wait. They almost left when suddenly a guy came out (didn't bother to explain who he was) and proceeded to seat \"whoever came in first.\" The other customers asked if they were going to be treated like we were. We then told the guy (whom we found out was the manger) that we planned on eating elsewhere and that we won't be back if that was how they treat their customers. So honestly I couldn't tell you how the food is because we didn't get any.  ***Update*** So after speaking with Matt, the manager, he promised if we came back and give the restaurant a second chance that things would be different. I hesitantly agreed, so we came in unannounced about a month later and we were immediately greeted by the hosted, she sat us down immediately and we were given chips and salsa along with water right away! Our server was incredibly attentive, he was alway around when we need him! They did changed their menu a lot but you can go old school if you want and order your favorite off of the old menu! We were very pleased with the service and how Matt turned a bad dining experience into a awesome one! We will be back again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for an early lunch and had a great time. Our food was amazing and our server, Espy, was a delight. Ive never had a server offer as many useful suggestions as she did. We will certainly return and request Espy to be our server"}
{"text":"The good: the food was fantastic! Went for lunch with my mom. She got the chimi that our server suggested and I got the tour. Both dishes were delicious, food was hot, and more than enough portion. Our server was attentive, polite, and on top of things. Good multi tasker. Kept out drinks full. I can't remember his name though. :( The other server near him was just as sweet. She wasn't our server but due to a mix up we ended up sitting in her section. She checked on us a couple times too to make sure things were going well. Great wait staff.  The bad: upon entering one of the two hosts asked how many. I said two, and neither of them did anything. So the manager that was standing there repeated that it was a table for two and told them to get us a table. She then grabbed a couple of menus and told us to follow her. She put us at an uncomfortable table right in between two large parties. When the manager came by I asked if our servers section included the booth in the corner that was small enough for two people so we wouldn't be getting in the way. He said yeah. I then asked if we could move to the booth. He said, \"why?\" The most rude why I've ever heard. Does it really matter why? Whatever, we told him why (because of how crowded it was) and he pointed to another booth and said, \"why don't you go sit there then.\" Rudest guy ever. And that's the manager!? He later came to apologize but not really because he said sorry, he didn't think he was rude.   Anyways, you'll have a fabulous experience if you get in and seated without seeing this guy."}
{"text":"There are certain places that are like an old friend.  That is how I feel about going to this location of Macayos.  The food isn't the best Mexican food in the valley but it is consistent.  I can say that, I've been eating there since they opened this location.  I happen to like the type of Mexican food they serve.  I have no problem with ground beef as opposed to the  shredded beef they serve at other places that gets under my bridgework and drives me nuts.  I can't tell you much about the drinks which seem important to many people.  The strongest I do is cranberry juice with actual lime juice which the actually remember to do when I ask for it at Macayos.  Cranberry juice with a few crushed limes doesn't do it for me.  I used the brain God gave me and stopped drinking alcohol years ago but I still like something at least with some flavor...  It is a good place to take friends when you just want to have a pleasant meal and talk.  Consistently, the wait staff is pretty jovial and most have been there for awhile.  The interior is in keeping with this same laid back attitude.  It isn't fancy but who is going to eat the interior?"}
{"text":"I'm giving this four stars for two reasons only. 1. Chicken poblano and 2. Sweet corn tamales with green chile and Baja sauce.. rice beans and salsa good also.. some of the dishes are lacking though"}
{"text":"OMG I Love this place! It's been my cousin and my go to fav place for sooooo long! The food is soooo good! The chips and salsa are so freekin fresh! I CRAVE them! And the service has always been on point!"}
{"text":"Macayo's happens to be one of few (only?) places open til a strange hour on Sundays, which I'm all for.  It was literally the only place we could find at 9pm on a Sunday to go for not-bad food.  I personally love their red-corn taquitos.  In fact, I love them so much, they are the reason I go here.  When someone has Macayo's catering, I can count on those little red devils to shine over all else.  Yum!  Typical Mexican beer selection.  Tryin' to push a zillion different margaritas.  May or may not get your order right, which for me isn't an issue (see: you can't really screw up a taquito order), but I've seen it more than once the wrong thing is delivered to the table."}
{"text":"Good/decent local Mexican food. Anything with Carne Asada or one the platters is worth a shot. Very good happy hour specials as well!"}
{"text":"Ok two weeks ago I had the Mex & Match for lunch, I had shredded beef enchilada, black beans and rice.  The beef enchilada was wonderful, I can't wait to have another!"}
{"text":"Meal was great...desert sucked!!!  Whatever you do don't get the fried ice cream.   It's not fried ice cream. They take a ball of ice cream and coat it in corn flakes. GROSS!!!!  Not sure how they can call this fried ice cream when it's clearly not"}
{"text":"Went to Macayo's on Central last night for dinner. HUGE mistake. We sat in the dining area and our waiter asked us our drinks (pink lemonade and raspberry iced tea) and then we get chips and salsa with watered down salsa  then the waiter comes about 10 mins later brings drinks (sprite/almost clear watered down raspberry iced tea) then he was helping the table next to us so after I call him and he kept on walking (maybe he didn't hear me) until the second time he came back and I got his attention then I order a coke instead and he takes our order. I ordered the mini chimies. 15 mins later I was greeted with dark brown on a plate and looked like they were fried in 10 day old dirty cooking oil or even possibly \"refried\" (wouldn't surprise me with all the watered down stuff) so because i had other stuff to do I decided not to complain and attempt to eat what they had given me and there are 6 which I ate 3 and I was tapped out on burnt grease...so he gives ME the bill which he watches me pull out my card and pay but when he comes back he hands my card and receipt to my guest.  Well I thought last night was a mistake but it didn't end there. Today I STILL have an after taste of grease. I have tried drinking a bubbly soda and chewing gum, popped an anti-acid and nothing...I literally had to leave work early and now laying here in my bed feeling nautious  as hell and staying close to a toilet as I write this review."}
{"text":"This is the original Macayo's and man has it seen better days. The decor is old. The carpeting is tired. The plates are chipped and scratched up. The service is crap and the food is NOT what it is at other Macayo's around town. It took our server 10 minutes to come and get our drink order. One member of our party ordered a Coke and it was totally flat. It took her another 10 minutes to replace it.  I had a chicken taco and the chicken tasted canned. The server spilled salsa all over the table and took forever to come back to clean it up. One member of our party ordered a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style and got a beef and green chili burrito with verde sauce...and then our server seemed befuddled when we asked for her to replace it with what we actually ordered.  Honestly, I have eaten in better dive-Mexican places than this Macayos. Definitely skip this spot."}
{"text":"We were here for AZ Bike Week. We stopped by about 9 PM and there was still a good crowd here. We had an excellent server who made good menu suggestions. The Margaritas and the Fahitas were excellent. I am surprised this place does not get higher marks. It was our first time there, but I would certainly return when back in the area."}
{"text":"Sadly they are tearing down this landmark. Very loud and noisy, but the food is great. We have had many great experiences at this location. The service and food was much better than our experience last week at the Scottsdale location!"}
{"text":"We have loved this restaurant since it opened. Not so much since the renovation. We ate there Friday night. Not sure if the waiter was bad at the job or if he couldn't hear us over the very first loud music. We had to repeatedly ask for things. My husband put the his empty drink glass on the edge of the table, the waiter passed our table several times even stopping to bring us things. We were given one refill, only after we asked for it."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were good. The cheese crisp was ok, a bit uninspired and the cheese was low grade to my taste. The tacos were solid. I did enjoy the margaritas.   The food here is OK, nothing special but they have good drinks and that's what I come here for."}
{"text":"4 stars for the chips and salsa... and then we can tack on the green corn tamale in baja sauce to the list of yummies.  Yes... a chain.  But it's pretty darn good for a mexican fix.  Have never had problems at this location.    I saw the patio... they have a nice fire pit to keep the peeps warm."}
{"text":"Once again the food was fabulous and the staff very friendly. They have a new manager Mirna who really goes above and beyond. Thanks for another great date night!"}
{"text":"The single worst dinning experience. The food was terrible and had to be sent back, the first waitress was inconvenienced by having to serve us. Forgot drinks and was rude. After she was replaced the meal went better and the new staff was great, and the manager got the food fixed."}
{"text":"If this place is average it's only because you've lived in Arizona your whole life and have been spoiled by great Mexican food. They have the best salsa HANDS DOWN! The bean burro enchilada style is awesome and so is the green burro. It's old school though and not a hipster place. If you want solid Mexican food at a good price this is your place."}
{"text":"My cousin just had her wedding catered by Macayo's catering service. The food tasted fresh and was pretty good. She ordered 100% vegetarian entrees and food was served buffet style. I would highly recommend the catered been chimichangas.  The desert was delicious. We had the flan. Super nummy!  They also provided \"skinny\" margaritas, which were the hit of the party. Absolutely delicious.  The servers were very nice and the wedding party was very satisfied."}
{"text":"As a self professed \"foodie\" I have had and know what it takes to prepare authentic and delicious mexican food.  Of all the genre's of cuisine, it is by far the easiest to execute well, so when I go out for mexican I expect a certain level of quality to the food.  Needless to say I wasn't impressed by anything at Macayo's.  The chips and salsa were mediocre at best, and the main courses sadly followed suit.  I am oblivious as to how places like this have more than one location.  If you are truly looking for a great experience check out Gallo Blanco over in phoenix.  Definitely worth the extra drive."}
{"text":"We arrived here during half time on Super Bowl Sunday and the dining room was empty with only a few patrons watching the game in the bar area.   Eight years ago when we moved to the valley, we were told that Macayo's was \"the\" original Mexican place going back to whenever. Apparently, the owner Woody Johnson and his wife invented the Chimichanga they say. http://www.macayo.com/the-history-of-macayos/  The valley has a few of these early pioneers still around, the Tee Pee restaurant in south Scottsdale comes to mind.  But a few months back Macaya's decided to update their restaurant from top to bottom and we were game (no pun) to see what the new place was like.    As you can see, it has leather back chairs, pottery, paintings and several baskets adorning the walls. Nice updates, but after reading Yelp friends Betsy B and Mya T's reviews, I was wondering why we came.   Truth is, Macaya's isn't half bad; that's not to say they're five stars either. Even with the place empty (we were the only ones in the dinning room for most of our stay), the service and food were uneven.   For instances our appetizer, the Queso Fundido $8.00 barely arrived before our entrée and we had to send it back because it was watery and undercooked.  The Manager stopped by and told us that \"it was taken out  of the oven too soon.  I'll take it off your bill.\"    The three of us ordered, the Mexican Flag Enchilada for $13.25, the Chicken Baja Burro for $11.50 and the Dos Chicken Enchilada for $11.75.  All were okay, just not memorable.  Our bill came to $52.98 before taxes and gratuities, including one Margarita (photo) $8.99 and two soft drinks."}
{"text":"Good food, even better Margaritas.  Invest in Senor Bob.  Margaritas go down smoother when they are just over $3"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years and the quality of food and service has been declining. Last order we placed was for over $45 and the average of our bills are around that. The tortilla soup was way over seasoned - could not eat it. Also, in a to go order usually the tortilla strips are on the side but our soups had soggy strips right on top. A lot of the food is way salty. This place needs to strict management to whip up the kitchen and the rest of the staff in shape and get back to selling great Mexican food."}
{"text":"Always good.    We got in and out at lunch with good food and attentive service.  You can order from a special lunch menu or their full menu.  I recommend going early, as we were leaving around 12:30 and the place was getting really full."}
{"text":"They have have renovated the restaurant and updated the menu, and I don't know that is for the better. We were told we could get almost everything off the old menu, which is what I did (Baja chimi), hubs had the new grilled fish tacos and the kid had mac n cheese.  To start, the salsa was VERY runny when compared to the old. Cutting my chimi was very difficult. For the restaurant that claims it invented the chimi, I find this disappointing. The flavor of the chicken was the same, but the tortilla tasted old and like they left it in the fryer too long. And the Baja sauce is $2 extra. No thanks, I'll get frozen chimi's and deal. It will be a LONG time before I ever want another one,  though.  Hubs liked his tacos but the portion size is too small. Barely any fish, tons of cabbage. And his side of beans was a child's portion.  And the part that makes me upset. My kid always orders mac n cheese and I know it is Easy Mac. Well they made it pretty poorly. She wouldn't eat it. How do you screw up microwaved mac n cheese? I mean, really?  The staff was nice, but that was my only good thing to say.  Lunch on a Sunday and there was almost no one there. That speaks volumes. I should have listened to my gut. Now my gut is screaming at me from how unhappy it is. Lesson learned and I won't go back."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! We went on a busy Saturday night but avoided the wait by sitting at the bar. Great service and food at the bar, so why wait for a table? I had a great margarita but it was mostly ice, really, I watched him make it. The treat was the green chili stew! Go get it! It comes with warm tortillas and it is tasty!"}
{"text":"Love this place bring my Macayo's mug for cheaper drinks  Spinach con queso dip and Chimis YUM The manager is great it's so nice to be remembered &  recognized when you are a regular customer"}
{"text":"What happened to you?  This place, specifically this Macayo's, used to be so good when I was a kid. I came back here last weekend and I was so disappointed. Everything about this place just seemed way sloppier than how it used to be.  Essentially, Macayo's is one of the staple eateries of Phoenix. It's like a bastard cousin of Garcia's (RIP). It's the typical Americanized Mexican food, nothing too spicy but plenty of taste and it's heavy too. It's true though what the reviews have described it as: a Mexican TGI Friday's or Denny's.  It's so sad to see Macayo's in the state. It's like that girl you used to think was cute when you were in junior high... but then you bumped into her a few days ago at the grocery store and she looks worn out in every sense of the word after surviving through four kids and three divorces. C'mon, Macayo's! Take care of yourself!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner last night.  It was a Thursday night at about 7:30 and the place was pretty dead which was nice.  Somehow I've never been to this location before and it is pretty run down and old but you still get the good ole Macayo's charm.  There are signs all over the place saying they are going to remodel the place this month so that will be nice.  The food was pretty good and exactly what you'd expect.  Not the best, not the worst.  You get some decent Mexican food at a decent price.  The best part is that I scored a Local Dines gift certificate ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ) and my meal was basically free.  Our waiter was very good, fast, and friendly.  He kept my diet cokes coming like clockwork which was awesome."}
{"text":"Shitty service shitty shitty food yes I'm very angry 86 me and my family because I had a four-year-old that likes to dance the managers a douche."}
{"text":"I cannot believe that anyone would give this 'restaurant' 1 star instead of 0. I would rather eat out of my toilet then eat anything offered on their menu. Nothing in the menu passes for quality Mexican or Tex-mex cuisine. The cheese crisp was disappointing, the enchiladas were uncooked, the waiter was rude to me pregnant wife because she refused to order an alcoholic beverage. We will not be back. Save your money."}
{"text":"The salsa was good and the food was ok. Had dinner with the wifey and friend and still had a good time. The chips were addicting and was full frontal m that and the salsa before my food even hit our table. Blast you chips and salsa! Our friend picked this place because it was going to come down soon and be replaced by condominiums. Thanks Macayo's!"}
{"text":"I've only been to this location twice, but each time our sever was the bartender, Daniel.  He is amazing.  I'd even go so far as to say he made the experience.  Super helpful and just wonderful.  Oh, and the vegetarian menu is pretty good, too :p"}
{"text":"Macayo's is having it's 70th anniversary and we saw a TV advertisement for $.70 tacos and enchiladas for the anniversary day only. Sounded like a great deal to us!   It was a good thing that we saw the ad because if you went to the restaurant without knowing about the special there is no way you would probably know about it. They had balloons outside, a board featuring other less stellar specials and a waitress who never said a word so it was up to us to ask about it.   I ordered a couple cheese enchiladas and my husband had 2 beef tacos and a cheese enchilada. With some complimentary chips and salsa and a couple of iced teas we were able to get (uncomfortably) full for around $9 before tip.   It was decent food at a price that you can't beat so we are glad we went."}
{"text":"Fast Friendly Fresh and Delish! My family of 4 is in town for The WSF cheer competition we stopped here in a hurry since it's so close to our hotel , first thing we said was \"we are in a hurry \" our sever took our drink and food order , immediately brought very tasty and light chips and salsa , put in our order and then brought the check! She said no rush I just want you be able to pay when ready acknowledging and being considerate of our time crunch!   Food was out shortly after that staff kept our drinks refilled and the food was hot fresh and just yummy thank you so much for an amazing first experience   I enjoyed the Mex and Match ( beef taco and cheese enchilada) with the tortilla soup!  My husband had the shrimp enchiladas and my children  had a very generous kid sampler plate ! Go give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I think most people are to hard on Macayo's.  The great thing about Phoenix is that there is so many great mexican food places, so sometimes Macayos gets the shaft.  The thing is they are good.  The salsa and chips are very good, in fact by the end of dinner we usually go through 2 bowls.  My favorite appitizers are the Red Corn Chicken Taquitos.  These are fantastic!  They are chicken taquitos topped with Baja sauce.  I really like most of their dishes, but my favorite is the chicken poblano.  It is a poblano stuffed with shredded chicken, fried and topped with relleno sauce and baja sauce.  I highly recommend it.  I live in California, where the mexican food is sub par at best.  I can't wait to go back to Macayo's and stuff myself."}
{"text":"The carnitas were good. My server was nice and attentive. The salsa was watery and tasted funny. Not worth the price overall imo. I've been to eat better places at lower prices. The outside of the building drew me in but the inside needs an overhaul."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Macayo's in downtown Phoenix.  By far my favorite location that I've been to.  The service was exceptional.  Our party was in a little bit of a rush to get to the Suns game and after telling our waitress, she was great at getting our meals out as promptly as she could and getting our bill taken care of quickly.    The food was great as usual.  The cheese enchiladas were great and they had a great beer special as well.    Another enjoyable experience at Macayo's"}
{"text":"It's all good for sure but I order the same thing every time I am here.... Chicken stuffed Poblano Pepper with Baja sauce.  No words.  Just incredible."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this macayos while I was still in my moms belly.   Love their salsa, love their happy hour, love Joey the bartender,and love their attitude. Great peeps and great  food!"}
{"text":"I grew up on this Macayo's location's food, literally. My grandmother moved to Arizona in 1942 and was excited when this place opened. So my family has been coming here for 50+ years. Is it the best Mexican food ever in Phoenix? No, it's not \"foodie\" food. Do they serve a great chimi? Yup. Enchilada sampler is good too. Chips and salsa always good and it's dining room is family friendly, if kitchy and dated. Love it or leave it, Macayo's is a landmark to Phoenicians."}
{"text":"Who's idea was it to sell tacos at The Salsa Challenge Saturday in RAW COLD OUT OF A PACKAGE CORN TORTILLAS?!?!?!  SWING and MISS!!  It crumbled with the first bite! There wasn't a second bite."}
{"text":"We took a party of 12 to Macayo for dinner on a Saturday night.  Since it was Saturday, the restaurant was busy, so the service wasn't the fastest in the world. But the server was very attentive, and did his best to keep up. He was also a good sport, which was good because we had a rather rowdy bunch.  The chips and salsa were outstanding. Most of us filled up on those while we waited for the food. The food was also outstanding.  With that many orders, a mix up or two isn't surprising, and we had them. One person wanted sour cream instead of salsa in her burrito - so a new one had to be made. Another ordered beef but got chicken.  Still, for that many orders on a busy night, I thought the restaurant did an excellent job.  I'm not a fan of Mexican food, but I thought everything tasted great, and I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Well, they got my order wrong, but were very good about making amends and serving me a piping hot new (correct) plate.  It was delicious.  And the margarita's were excellent as well."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Macayos for years, and I have always been pretty satisfied with the overall quality of the food.  The indgredients are fresh, and the food has an appealing presentation.  The chips and salsa are some of the best out of various Mexican restaurants that we frequent.  The real issue with this location is that the staff is really inconsistent.  Occasionally, we will get a competent, friendly server, but for the most part, the service leaves much to be desired.  The servers tend to give the impression that they are annoyed to be serving you.    Other than that, the restaurant is fine - we continue to return even with the spotty service."}
{"text":"I used to love Macayo's, but the menu has been redesigned and it's a disaster. Favorites like the green chile burro are no longer available, and the food that is available is in tiny (although nicely-presented) portions that are greasy and not as flavorful as the previous dishes. I understand the desire to freshen things up, and the new decor looks okay, but the food is the reason I used to go and the reason I won't return. From the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty today all through what should have been the lunch rush, and their super-slow servers still had nothing to do, I'm not the only one who feels this way."}
{"text":"When I moved to Scottsdale from SoCal, one of my BIGGEST fears was that I wouldn't be able to find the kind of Mexican food that I like (seriously).   People are always super opinionated (myself included) about where to go for the best Mexican food and in the past I have been disappointed in most of the recommendations I have received.  While I have yet to venture out and find a taqueria worthy of replacing Taqueria de Anda (Santa Ana, CA), I have found a good substitute for my beloved La Capilla (Huntington Beach, CA).   When you walk in, you are greeted with kitschy \"mexican\" decor. Their hostesses are efficient and we've always been seated quickly.  The food is great. One of my biggest pet peeves is when restaraunts lack consistency. When I go to Macayos I know exactly what I am going to get... every time.   Everything that I have tried (so far) has been great. My favorites: Grande Chimichanga de Macayo with chicken or carnitas, tortilla soup and their green chili corn tamale... mmm  They also make great drinks and have a great happy hour, all their apps are 1/2 price. My fave is their green chili corn tamale bites, served with a side of baja sauce. Have you tried the baja sauce people? It's (jalapeno cream cheese I think?) soo bad but soo good.  I know a lot of people probably have mixed feelings about this place because it's a \"chain\" restaurant... but to me it just doesn't feel like it. It's nowhere near what I would consider \"chain\" Mexican food to be: El Torito... They aren't in the same category. All I have to say is don't knock it til' you try it.  My only complaint would be the wait staff (the bartenders are great)... Don't get me wrong, the service has (almost) always been WAY better than average. However, most aren't too friendly and a few are just downright odd. But, I won't hold that against them or the restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant has for years been our favorite holiday and birthday location. What a disappointment it was this time. The menu had changed, and several of our favorites were no longer listed, including the Baja Chimi. They did make what we asked for, but without extra sauce and poorly plated.  One meal was inedible (for the first time in my life, I actually returned a meal)--the taco shells were as hard as rocks--I could not bite through one at all; the chips and salsa on the table were cold and chewy.  Worst of all, there was silverware on the floor under my son's chair, and chunks of food under mine. The restaurant was not so busy that they couldn't have cleaned up the floor around a table before seating a new party.  In the end, there was no apology for the bad meal, the waitress mixed up our drinks, the bill miscalculated the tip, and we were so happy to leave that we barely even noticed the waitress did not even offer dessert. For an $80 birthday dinner, it was a big let down."}
{"text":"We went during happy hour and sat in the bar area. The place was relatively empty and too low of lighting to see anything. I ordered a strawberry margarita which was WAY too sweet! It was half foam on top and I didn't feel like it was worth the $6 price tag. Usually when I go to mexican restaurants they bring you chips and salsa however, they had a buffet style layout with a few extra items you don't normally see. The service was great and overall a clean establishment! I wouldn't recommend for happy hour again- too many other great restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I find they're gringo, faux -Mexican food, heartburn inducing and unimaginative.   Why would anyone eat there when they're are far better and more authentic choices for Mexican food in the Phoenix area?    Try Los Sombreros as an outstanding alternative to a huge disapointment."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence about something here...  4 or 5 stars.      Monday night was our first time visiting this Macayo's location and like... it didn't BLOW. US. AWAY.  or anything,  but it's a fact that our waiter (the bartender, we sat at the bar) was awesome,  friendly and chatted with us enough that we didn't feel ignored but little enough that we could enjoy our meal.       Steak Diablo (done well) was a perfect choice and the chef trimmed that steak perfectly, not one bite of fat or gristle.        They have a whole vegetarian menu,  how awesome is that?!     Portions were perfect,  generous but not retarded where you hate yourself afterward.       I try not to just give out 5 stars like they're free and nothing about our visit was over the top amazing,  but I just can't think of anything wrong with the place either.    5 it is."}
{"text":"We had our LARGE super bowl party catered by Espy, Erica and Heather. I cannot thank them enough. They were sooo professional and the food came out fresh and delicious...and no one left on an empty stomach. The enchiladas were flavorful and meat seasoned to perfection. The crew went above and beyond and even cleaned up plates all while maintaining a fresh rotation of food. These guys were the perfect compliment to what became an amazing party. Would recommend to anyone. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location, which happens to be the original Macayo's, and I couldn't help, but be reminded of the Robert Frost poem, The Road Not Taken...  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood (because the hostess was MIA) And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;  ... okay, sorry, so after entering and walking down the dimly light hallway you have the option to veer left or right. Right brings you into the bar area and left, to the dining area. In the middle is the hostess desk, (who probably took the road less traveled by) so I meandered into the dining room where I was I greeted by a friendly female waitress who helped me find my way to a table and later brought the menus.  I was waiting for the other two members of the party and since it was 11:30 am and I'm inbetween classes, I figured the White Cranberry Margarita sounded reasonable (its five o'clock somewhere!). It was a little bit salty, a little bit sweet, but all so sensual  that I had to remind myself that there was alcohol in it so I could pace myself. The chips and salsa were fantastic (but really, how can anyone mess that up) to nosh on while the other party members arrived. The lunch specials here are pretty amazing and it does get crowded fast. I went for the lunch Mex and Match 1 item with 1 side for $6.99. I got a bean tostada with veggies. The veggies were a pleasant surprise, they were steamed but not doused in butter that most places seem to love to do. I just wish they would have thrown a little bit more on the plate. There were two pieces of broccoli, a few tiny pieces of carrots, and zucchini, but I get it...I'm at a Mexican joint. Everyone else loved their dishes and the service was quick, but attentive. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here when I came to visit him in Phoenix and it's one of his fave mexican joints to eat at. They have a really cool bar area and two huge big screen tv's featuring the latest sports event (phoenix suns game when i was there). The drinks are pretty good, we had some beer and girly drinks (strawberry margarita and mojitos) which tasted not so bad and the fresh chips and salsa were kept us from going hungry while we waited for our actual food (the service is really slow). I had some chicken taquitos and shrimp tacos were which came with rice and lettuce. I thought the food was pretty good, but I don't know how authentic it is. I'd still go here again as long as I had some friends with me"}
{"text":"When I was pregnant we probably ordered from this restaurant once a week for about two months. Every time we got our food it was amazing!!! Chicken tacos, sampler appetizer, dips, drinks... everything was great! They even knew my fiancés voice on the phone and would immediately know his name and our order! When we would dine in they are all so super friendly every time! I would totally recommend this place to anyone ! Wish we still lived in phoenix! We miss this place!"}
{"text":"This was one of my early favorites when I first started living here two years ago.  I love their chips and hot sauce.  Some of the best in Phoenix.  Last two visits really missed the boat.  This last time the service was so bad that I had to chase my waiter down just to get my order delivered correctly.  Food is pretty good.  Love the Baja Burro.  But, two less than great service experiences--I won't be back."}
{"text":"We are a large party. Started with 12, but 2 left. Took an hour to get meals. Maybe the server was new. Ok food; nothing memorable."}
{"text":"Went during out to Macayos at about 230pm. Noticed floors (with ugly casino carpet) were VERY dirty. Tables were not bussed for over 45 minutes...some remaining dirty before and after we left. Two parties that came in after us were seated next to dirty tables. We were given the Lunch Menu, even though it didn't apply on weekends. The restaurant is RUN DOWN, shabby, and the upholstery and chairs need to be replaced. My meal was relatively flavorless. The margaritas that were \"on sale\" were sugary and weak. The Drink Menu presented to us (which we had to ASK twice for) was sticky over all pages. Our table had dried food and cheese clinging to it and silverware was very flimsy and dirty. Wooden chairs were wobbly, like they could give way any moment. It's an insult to Mexicans to call this a \"Mexican\" restaurant. This Macayo's location is filthy (bathrooms as well), dirty, dark, and outdated. Hopefully tourists don't go here as it would be a bad representation of what Phoenix has to offer in regard to Mexican/Southwest food. There is better Mexican food to be had/eaten in Phoenix. It's sad to see this landmark on Central in decline."}
{"text":"From years past, my husband and I have fond memories of visiting Phoenix and Macayo's. We spotted this one while running errands and thought, since it's Cinco de Mayo why not!  We weren't disappointed. My margarita and taquitos were delicious and my husband's tortilla soup on point.  Great service completed our experience."}
{"text":"Pretty standard fare Mexican food. In a town full of good Mexican food, Macayo's can still provide a good meal for a good price. Their green corn tamales are pretty awesome. Service was great. Julie, our server, was friendly, attentive, and quick. She was a real pro and even though she was busy, she provided exceptional service.   Food is what gets you the the restaurant, service brings you back."}
{"text":"This place is the reigning king of the \"Screw real Mexican food, we are Americans and make Mexican our way\" category.  You know the contenders.  Macayo's,  Arriba, Ajo Al's, Mi Amigos, Julio G's and the like.  They each have their local empires and they are plentiful in Phoenix.  If you are into heavy creams, greasy cheeses, shredded beef, and other hallmarks of this gut busting tradition than Macayo's is the place for you.  A great place to fill up on calories.  On a positive note the chips are alright and their Downtown and Mesa locations are pretty cool buildings."}
{"text":"Just celebrated Cinco de Mayo at Macayo's on Scottsdale Road - just loved the Grand Margarita, chicken small tacos - and yum on the decried beans!  My husband had the burrito and ate it all Service was amazing!  Our wait staff, Wyatt, was spot on - brought extra salsa and chips - perfect - always there when needed! We will be back"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale.  The food is terrific and the frozen margaritas are the best.  Mirna and Jeff are extremely accommodating and really understand the meaning of customer service.   Rick G."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food ever. Really cheap too. Just go and get the Mini-Chimis, they are an appetizer, but all you need. Margaritas are excellent as well."}
{"text":"Excelente dining option, first time in Phoenix! My husband used to come to Macayos 15 yrs ago while visiting our son! When planing this trip, he was sure to add it in our plan and! Needless to say we had a great dinner excellent Margaritas and our server Greg was very nice and professional! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The service was not too great. The Waitress needs to smile more. We were a party of 9. The food was ok, prefer authentic, this taste like it was out of a can. Most likely won't be coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We have been to Macayo's for many years. We go for the chips and salsa and their wonderful frozen margaritas. We were dismayed to see the completely remodeled restaurant which has left the place without a personality. The revised menu has removed many of our favorites. The chips served to us were stale. The margaritas were without the amount of alcohol that we have had in the past - we could hardly tell that there was any alcohol at all. They were not frozen but very watery. The order for the drinks came out wrong and so did my main dish... sloppy service at best. We ordered fried ice cream and were very surprised to see that the strawberries have been replaced by a strawberry flavored sauce. Cost cutting measures have cheapened the entire experience. We spent our 16th anniversary with this restaurant - it was not the Macayo's we have grown to love."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here after she arrived from a late afternoon flight.  She was on east coast time, and was both tired and hungry.  The staff here was friendly and seated us quickly.  Our waiter was helpful, friendly, on point, and attentive.  The food and margarita's arrived in a timely fashion, and was very good.  We were both very happy with our meal."}
{"text":"Growing up, this was a restaurant that our family avoided. Now we're older and our tastes have changed. Macayo hasn't. It's bland, boring Mexican food with watery, flavorless salsa that my now elderly parents can't get enough of and I go along for the ride.  If you have snowbirds to entertain, this will surely do the trick. Nobody will get something too spicy. Otherwise, there are better choices in town. But if you enjoy the culinary time warp and your stomach can handle heavy, bland Mex, have a seat, as these recipes haven't changed since 1948."}
{"text":"Thank you Greg Montelongo and Joey Coassolo for always taking care of us! Hope you guys know how much we love and appreciate you guys! Until next time...."}
{"text":"Ive been to this location at least a dozen times, and its so hit-or-miss that its hard to write a review. The last time we went (06/16) we had impeccable service and wonderful food. The wife got some burritos, I had a taco platter, and the kid had a quesadilla. All were great. But just a few months before we went with some family from out-of-state, and it was awful! Our server (I forget her name) was slow, didn't refill drinks, and messed up a dish so bad that we had to send it back. Overall the ambience is pretty good, pricing is decent, and portions are pretty good. There are far better Mexican places in town that I wouldn't recommend this place. We just come here because its less than a 1/4 mile from our place."}
{"text":"A very odd experience.    We entered in the front of the restaurant where we were met by the hostess.  We told her we were there for happy hour and she proceeded to show us to what I thought was the bar area. Well, yes but she took us out the back door of the restaurant, to the back door of the bar.  Once there I started to get nervous.  A line of 4 or 5 people waiting to get in met by two security people checking Identification.    Once you show the security people your ID, they then put a wrist band on you.  I am pushing 50, but perhaps without the wrist band, someone may mistake me for under 21.    Finally inside, it was a throw back to some 80's nightclub with old school music and flashing lights and more, at attention security staff.    They feature a free happy hour buffet with assorted Mexican food, which was actually fresh and tasty.  Our server was nice and attentive.    The entire time we were there, I was worried to why they needed a security team roaming about."}
{"text":"Personally, I am insulted when someone visits Phoenix and asks me to take them to a Macayo's. The other reviews' analogies to Denny's and TGI Fridays are spot on. I would add Olive Garden to the list of good comparisons.   Would you go to Italy and ask your host to take you to a McDonalds?   I understand that the company apparently has a well-oiled marketing machine in place, since many out-of-towners seem to know about it the moment they get off the plane. If I was reviewing marketing departments I guess they'd get 5 stars. But I honestly can't think of a scenario where going out to eat at Macayo's would ever be worthwhile or necessary. Maybe, your car runs out of gas right at the intersection of Central and Clarendon and you have a disease that will kill you if you don't eat within the next 20 minutes? But then, Fez is right there. Oh, but the disease specifically requires you to eat Mexican food or you'll die? Fine. That's what Blue Burrito is for, but at lower prices and less time (not to mention less calories). So again, why dine at Macayo's?  If you do want to eat there, please, just avoid hurting my feelings and do it behind my back."}
{"text":"Hmmm... I should probably leave the review there, but there is just too much to say.  1. Is a margarita up an uncommon term? I use it all of the time at home and everyone seems to know what it means. Tonight the waitress looked at me as if I had 2 heads when I said it.  2. Do not serve me chips in a metal kitchen bowl. They were cold and oily and just not good.  3. I like cilantro just as much as the next person, but when the only thing I taste is cilantro... again, not good.  4. Mom ordered the baja chicken salad, which has to be the nastiest salad I have ever tasted. Too spicy and too much cilantro.  The good news is, that I do not live in Scottsdale and NEVER have to eat here again.  Next time, I will go to Del Taco."}
{"text":"I'm deeming this an oldie but goodie. If you've been a frequenter of Phoenix for over 15+ years, you've most likely paid at least one of Macayo's locations a visit. The food is run of the mill yet decent Mexican food. The portions are hearty and the food is cheap. The margaritas are above average and if you invest of one of their margarita glasses, you can get margarita refills moving forward for just $3. Not a bad deal as long as you remember the glass!   Macayo's is a solid choice if you're hungry and want to get in and out in a relatively decent amount of time, if you have children who are a little loud and yet you want to take them out to dinner, or if you just feel like a good margarita after a long day at work.   That's it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was one of the first I visited after moving to Scottsdale from Southern California.  The food wasn't horrendous and the service wasn't atrocious, but there were definitely things that could have been better.    The sauces were a little bland and so that in turn made the food not too memorable.  It lacked that authenticity that I had grown to love at home and seemed more like a more expensive Del Taco experience.    The service wasn't terrible but there were not that many people there and it seemed that neither was the staff.  This, I never hold against the waiters themselves as I have no clue what has been going on throughout the day.    So, all in all, it isn't a terrible place to go, but I will keep my eye out for a more authentic Mexican experience."}
{"text":"I come here almost every single week with my dodgeball teammates before our games, and it's consistently awesome. The bartending staff is friendly, super quick, and they make A+ margaritas. All the food I've had here has been great, and the chips and salsa are always plentiful.   If you're looking for a quick and delightfully cheesy bite to eat, plus some solid drinks, this is always a good choice!"}
{"text":"First time to this location. Had a great server named Chelsea, she was friendly and patient with our group. Enjoyed the new menu and feel of the restaurant. Food is always good and consistent from location to location."}
{"text":"Mini chicken chimmies with extra guacamole and sour cream plus a  frozen canyon three tequila margarita with salt.  Muy Bueno on the patio in the late afternoon on a relatively cool day without the misters to soak you.  In the morning I felt I had to go back to oatmeal and berries (red, black and blue) to counter the dairy products and alcohol from the day before.  Works for me..."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin to point out all the sucks about Macayo's.. they have NO redeeming qualities about them. Greasy chips, tasteless watery salsa and horrible food!  We ate at this location twice and both times we ordered the mini chimi's which BOTH times came to the table frozen in the middle! Uhg! Most learn from their mistakes, not here.. they make the same mistakes and obviously don't care enough to try to make things right.  Both entree's were served to us at room temperature. Chicken Quesadailla and the Baja Enchilada.   If you want to have decent Mexican food please, go somewhere else! For this style of food I think I would prefer Carlos O'briens."}
{"text":"The food is always good, which is why we keep going back. The big issue is the noise and how hard it is to even have a conversation there. It may have been because of all the noise that the waitress got my order wrong, but either way it just shouldn't happen.  I tried the blood red orange margarita, which was nothing special and over priced. I think if you are going to go that route you should just stick with their regular margarita.   I will say that one other thing you can never go wrong with is their green corn tamale with Baja sauce. It is fantastic!"}
{"text":"My parents and I love going to Macayo's! The cheese crisp and enchiladas are great and the margaritas ( in  a \"Bob\" or \"Cha Cha\" glass, of course) are EXCELLENT! Try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Sad to see this restaurant go.  The charm on the inside will be missed.  The only concern I had with this establishment the last time I visited was the service was very slow.  I had to wait almost 20 minutes to get a refill on water."}
{"text":"I had the grilled fish tacos in corn tortillas, and the taste of that dish is worth four stars, but the price ($13) is at least two dollars more than it should be.  The salsa was good, particularly the thicker hot sauce, and the person I was with also liked their meal.  The service was good on our visit, though it was not really crowded.  The decor is dark and tired, and it was not the cleanest place around."}
{"text":"People have talked about this place like it was absolutely amazing, I knew I would have to try it for myself eventually. And just last week I did- awful experience. It was during the lunch hour and it was crazy busy. You could hear everyone talking and it just wasn't too peaceful. It took 10 minutes for a waiter to take a drink order, then another 15 minutes to order my food, food didn't come out till 25 minutes later. The food was okay, not that great. I have had a lot of authentic Mexican food and this didn't compare. The only thing that I absolutely loved was the salsa. I will return but perhaps at a different time of day- hopefully when it's not so busy and will choose carefully on my order."}
{"text":"An Arizona classic!!  I grew up going here and it is still a staple, and a can't miss for out of town guests.  The home of the chimi and some of the best salsa and cheese crisps in the valley!  Stick with thee classics, enchilada, tacos, tostada and you are good to go!  If you are there for lunch just get Woody's special and you get it all!  The chips and salsa are made fresh and so good that you have to be careful and not fill up before your food!"}
{"text":"Having spent quite a bit of time eating in Mexico, the menu at Macayo's is definitely Americanized... but that does not make it bad.  The food is pretty good, and the margaritas are to die for... fun casual atmosphere... people do bring families, so it can get distracting with crying children in the next booth.."}
{"text":"My server was Esperanza, she was amazing! The service was great and food was so good. Authentic, yummy good portions and a relaxed environment with nice music. Also a full bar!! My boyfriend and I enjoyed his birthday dinner (:"}
{"text":"Let's be honest:  This is not true authentic Mexican food.  This is Mexican food as the gringos imagined it.  Having said that, that doesn't mean it's bad Mexican food.  The salsas are good, there is a sauce made of cream cheese, everything has cheese on it, and I'm sure they'd fry your salad if you asked nicely.  They have a pretty good happy hour the back room (the Aztec room I believe) is a good place to start.   The restaurant is huge and despite that, due to the massive amount of wait staff, you should be able to get in and out in a hurry.  Plus the building looks like a pretend Mayan temple."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Macayo's for awhile and I remember them being better than last night. Both of our foods, bean burro and chimi, were completely tasteless. Probably the worst burro or burrito I've ever had. Although, our server was great and the tortilla soup was good.  We usually have Mexican food 2-3 times a month and with how many mexican restaurants there are, we have many to choose from and Macayo's will not be one we return to."}
{"text":"One a busy night our server Jorge did amazing. He anticipated out needs and met them efficiently. The food of course was delicious. We ordered the mexi mix n match and got the ground beef burro enchilada style. Always feel happy at the sight of our bill price. We come here often and will continue. Make sure you ask for Jorge if you're looking for great service."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of this restaurant, ever since I was a kid. All of the locations are great to me. This location, however, is a bit rundown and out of date looking. Today I was greeted, sat, and served in a small amount of time. The waitress was kind and did a great job, and the food was as good as it's always is. I enjoy coming here while in town!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Phoenix/ Scottsdale for 33 years. This used to be avoid restaurant but the last two visits have been disappointing. This week not only did the 2 of us wait over an hour to get our food, but the food is only marginal. Very basic, bland flavor on the chimichanga, but soggy, how can you ruin a quesadilla ? This one was over cooked and the cheese was hard. I guess this is my last visit. I know that Nando's is out in the East valley and a drive but their food is so superior.   I noticed that this has become a snowbird hang out. I guess they do not know good Mexican food.   The chips and salsa...pass on that, stale chips and no flavor salsa."}
{"text":"As being a fan of Macayo's for 43 years this is the worst experience I had.  Ordered a Carne Asada Burro and there was very little steak.  In fact, not much of anything in the center.  Very disappointed in the quality of this product.  Will not go back to this store again."}
{"text":"Ho hum.  Service was a bit on the slow side but I can overlook that for good food.  We had the new fundito cheese dip for an appetizer.  It had quite a zip of peppers - more than I expected, but 4/5 stars for the dip.    We both had entrees that were ok, but nothing spectacular.   Honestly, it tasted like any mexican place but at a higher price.  I appreciated that the majority of servers were not 18 year olds, but older and more mature looking.  I ordered my dish without guac and when it arrived, there was evidence that the kitchen had made a mistake and replated the dish because the was clearly guac on a piece of the quesadilla.  Not a huge deal, but a sign of hastiness.  For the price, I expected more than a battery operated tealight in a cheap glass jar in the middle of the table (see picture).  Most dinner dishes were 10-14 bucks.  I'm by far a restaurant snob, but that seemed very tacky!  A decent place to eat but with room for improvement."}
{"text":"Tara is the best bartender in town!!!!amazing dancer !!!!!! She makes the best cocktails in arizona, if you ever around Macayos on central stop by and sit at the bar . (Tara) will take care of you.  Her fav Margarita to serve you will be DON JULIO MADE WITH AÑEJO DON JULIO MIX WITH GRAND MANIER , AND A SPLASH OF RASBERRY CHAMBOARD!!'  Great time !!"}
{"text":"Well this place has to be doing something right my understanding this is where the President of the United States ate while he was in town very cool my experience has been really great with this restaurant I love the atmosphere and there so many places to sit as far as tables and the atmosphere is very festive the food was good and the service was quick when you consider how many people they are serving they do a good job the margaritas were very good I would definitely recommend recommend them"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar exclusively.  Nothing to complain about, nothing to rave about.  Food portions are much smaller than one may expect from a local 'sit down\" Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty bad. Seated fast but 1st contact from waitress took 10 min with chips and salsa in tow. By that time we were ready to order. Normal stuff, taco and burrito plates, wife ordered margarita as well. Water and tea were brought out in a timely fashion, but was followed by the food like 2 mins after we ordered it making me think they had brought it to the wrong table. Normally fast service for food isn't a bad thing, only my plate was as hot as a stove top burner, (this is good) but my tacos were not even warm but cold. How that's possible I don't know. Not that picky and it tasted okay so we pushed on. Our waitress returned sometime later and asked if there was anything she could get us as she looked at our empty glasses...at this time still no margarita and my wife cancelled it. Waitress seemed disappointed as she was \"just going to get it\" little late as we were half way done with our food. She then returned and filled my empty tea glass with water...tea wasn't on the bill so not that big of a deal, water was good though...waitress seemed nice enough but not all together with it.   With all the restaurant choices in central Phoenix, these guys better get their act together or they wont be there much longer...should have known something was wrong when we walked into a nearly empty place at 5pm....next"}
{"text":"Best little secret we were told to try. Shay was our server he was awesome the food was amazing so much we had to take half of it home love this place would definitely recommend it 10 stars. Manager/owner came to check to see how her food was fantastic great amazing time."}
{"text":"Went with my friend for dinner on a Saturday night, and we got seated right away. Our wait or was amazing, and he would only stop to check on us if we were not in the middle of a conversation. He constantly just refilled our waters without even asking. He did not make us feel rushed, and was very helpful when it came to ordering. They were closing soon and did not try to rush us out, and worked around us. The staff was amazing, and the enviorment was nice."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location for many years, but recently came here and had the best experience the food was awesome and our server was amazing . I came with my older brother who is not well  Espy went  above and beyond to make sure he was comfortable and  able to get a little something in his stomach he  is being treated with  chemo therapy.  Espy was so personable and cheery. I would come back again."}
{"text":"We had a party of 9 and had one of the best servers tonight by the name of Heather. She was so attentive we never had a chance to ask for anything. :-) She was professional, efficient, and very friendly. I did have slight issue with my meal that I was sharing with my husband and she overheard. She had her manager Lindsey come out and she was so amazing....she not only took the meal off the bill but she had the chef make a new one to go for me to have as a surprise. SOOOO SWEET and above and beyond! Had a great night!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location one time before and the experience was not memorable, so we decided to try it again.  We walked into the bar and at least half the stools were empty, but there were still checks and dirty plates scattered all over.  It took about 10 minutes for that to be cleaned up.  When I received the chicken taco I ordered, the meat wasn't even lukewarm.  I asked for a new taco and got beef instead because I was worried that the chicken was being held at the wrong temperature and I didn't want to chance getting sick.   My hubby's dish was barely hot as well.  The cheese enchilada was also lukewarm.    The server delivering our plates told us to be careful because the plates were hot, but when we touched them, the plates weren't really hot at all.  Eating at this Macayo's was a so-so experience at best."}
{"text":"The inside is very Hispanic, the food not so much. Not to say that is not good. But not authentic. It has a good flavor, but is pretty generic Mexican food. Now the Margaritas are wonderful!!!! I usually don't drink more then one but at this place you just can't help yourself. I like fruity girlie drinks, where you don't taste the liquor you just feel the affect. This is exactly what I want. Uno Mas, the water is no longer needed!"}
{"text":"Love the shredded beef tacos! Service was great! Julie helped us at the bar and was attentive, personable and friendly! Can't go wrong here...every time is delicious!"}
{"text":"Worst service I ever had waiting an hour and still didn't get our meal I was very disappointed"}
{"text":"I do not like this restaurant and would not even take visiting guests here. The food tastes like it came from cans."}
{"text":"An evening with good food, prompt service and an enjoyable ambience. We're vegetarian so had limited options to choose from. We opted for the Famous Cheese Crisp and Veggie Fajithas. Both were made well and enjoyed a good meal in the lovely romantic ambience."}
{"text":"We got to experience Macayo's because the local Italian restaurant is closed on Sundays.  How to express the feel...?  Not very busy on a Sunday afternoon around 4 PM...overpriced and certainly light-on-the-tequila margaritas...plenty of chips and salsa being delivered to the table...entrees that took WAY too long to be delivered...portion size and presentation leaving much to be desired...and the waiter kept our water glasses full.  Would you be satisfied with an order of rolled tacos which list on the menu as coming topped with  guacamole?  When the cheese is sprinkled on so lightly that you can count the shred strands on each one?  When the guacamole is served in a 2-ounce solo cup on the side?  I think not!  Another in my party ordered a chicken soft taco and a bean and cheese burrito...the chicken was in shreds, like someone in the kitchen boiled breast, thighs and legs and subsequently shredded them with a fork.  The worst part was no seasoning...save for the salsa served with the chips.  The bean and cheese burrito was a study in rice...so much rice that it was difficult to find the beans and cheese in the burrito.  The fourth in our group ordered the nachos supreme.  The chips are advertised as coming smothered in beef or chicken (he chose beef), cheese, refried beans, tomatoes, sour cream and guacamole.  Again, the guacamole came on the side in a 2-ounce solo cup as well as the sour cream.  They were not requested on the side...but they came that way.   As I am in search of the best guacamole burrito on the planet, that is what I ordered...a burrito that is guacamole, sour cream, bacon, cheese and raw onion.  The burrito I received...got the guacamole...got the cheese...got the sour cream...missing the onion...and some really fatty bacon.  It has been a long time since I had a guacamole burrito that chewy.  Margaritas were just a flat-out mistake.  I guess you have to know someone behind the bar to get much more than the faint whisper of a tequila bottle being passed in front of the glasses.  When they are delivered, they look incredible...the glasses filled perfectly...the salt on the rim done so well you could take a measuring tape to the glass and find perfect consistency all the way around.  While I enjoy the look of a well-presented margarita, I wanna feel and taste tequila in it!  Maybe this works for the family 'hispanic eatery down the street'...it does not do so well for me."}
{"text":"I was supposed to meet friends for margaritas at Macayo's about a year ago... but we couldn't find parking on a Friday night. Tonight, when my roomie said she was up for Mexican, I couldn't even remember what the place was called, just where it was located and that I had been meaning to try it for quite some time.  The decor of Macayo's is bright and colorful. With all the porcelain looking animals, including a large number of birds and frogs it felt almost Caribbean. While it didn't feel upscale, this is far from a hole in the wall place. Macayo's is relatively large, which explains why I had a parking problem a year ago. This time around (about 8 p.m. on a Wednesday) parking was no problem. The restaurant wasn't completely dead, just relatively quiet.   When dining at a Mexican restaurant for the first time, I stick to the basics. For starters, I wasn't impressed by the salsa and chips. The salsa, although seeming homemade, was fairly standard restaurant style... and heavy on the cilantro. It wasn't watery or chunky. It wasn't particularly spicy or bland. The chips weren't warm and sorta tasted like they came out of a bag. We also ordered the bean dip for an appetizer. While the bean dip was better than the salsa, it still wasn't very impressive. The \"creamy\" refried beans bordered on watery and most of the dip tasted bland until you hit a jalapeo or cilantro leaf.   For the main course, I ordered the Sonoran Enchilada Sampler, which includes a beef enchilada with green chile sauce, a chicken enchilada with Baja sauce and a cheese enchilada in red sauce with black beans and rice. This was the highlight of the meal. The rice was excellent. The cheese enchilada had a little bit of zing to it which was a nice surprise after the salsa and bean dip. The chicken enchilada, in addition to the green chile sauce was covered in a spicy jack cheese that complimented the chicken. The beef enchilada... is sitting in my fridge, as the portions are rather large (standard for most Mexican resturants in the area).  I found picking a star rating for Macayo's difficult. I usually reserve three stars for restaurants to which, while I would return, didn't have many other redeeming qualities. On the other hand, I usually reserve four stars for restaurants that, while they have great food, still have flaws. In other words, I'd give Macayo's a 3.5 stars if it were an option. There are definitely other things on the menu that caught my eye... and due to the location, I'll probably eventually end up back at Macayo's meeting people for margaritas."}
{"text":"Food mediocre, took three times to get our order right and they were out of sopapillas. No compensation for all the issues."}
{"text":"3 minutes to 9pm on a Tuesday night, starving after a movie, what's open? Driving down Scottsdale Rd and needing to have something we have not had yet (needing more to review, of course), what the heck, we can check out Macayo's. Sadly, staving off a low blood sugar headache, we just did not have time to consult Yelp.   We were seated right away with only 4 other parties in the restaurant and not a soul in the bar. Chips, watery salsa and water came right away. Is this really salsa? Seems more like tomato soup. The chips, very thin  and cold. I like them thin, but warm would be nice. We scoured the menu and went with veggie fajitas and a green enchilada from the light menu.   The food arrived. The veggie fajitas sizzling away. A good selection of broccoli, squash, peppers, zucchini, mushrooms, and carrots. Fairly fresh seeming sauteed veggies. A separate plate with some guac, refried beans and sour cream. A new approach to the tortillas, 2 large ones. Not what we expected, but the fixins do not fall out that way. The enchilada was tiny. I found the little tortilla. One small corn tortilla with some chicken in it. Some good spiced black beans. And some sauteed veggies. Ok, more shrooms.   Overall, just nothing to write home about. Just another mexican place. Our waiter was very nice and very attentive to my water (I went through 4 glasses). But, it just seemed like this chain is trying unsuccessfully to be like Chevy's. It did it's job to get us some food."}
{"text":"Been going to Macayo's on Central for years now. This garish building looks like a old hollywood reproduction of an Aztec temple. The place is huge with about 3 main dining areas. ON Friday Nights they shut off one area and make it into a bar, complete with a buffet and you can also order food. The Salsa and Merenge music turns to hip hop as the night heats up.  Guys,  wear your best silk shirt and bling and white tie,  Girls dress as scanty as possible and you will fit right in.  Had a combination platter at 9PM which was simply the best Mexican food I have ever put into my mouth! I usually don't go for tamales but these minature babies were just heaven's delight. Also it had little corn puffs which you could dip into fondito sauce, that I have never seen before but they were great!  Top the night off with Tons of Margarita's and you will feel like an Aztec King."}
{"text":"I ordered Macayo's catering for the office and what awesome customer service. It was so seamless and made my life easier. The food was so delicious too!"}
{"text":"First off: BORN AND RAISED IN TEXAS FOR 2 DECADES. I know, and love, some good tex-mex. I always go to macayo's to get my fix!! Most recently, I had an experience that I had to share. The environment was welcoming and clean, as always, and we were seated quickly. About 15 minutes after placing an order for my girlfriend and myself, our waiter, Mark, came back to let us know there was a \"problem\" in the kitchen, and my queso would take a little longer than expected, having just finished the first round of chips I was not displeased to know it would only be a short bit longer. Mark stayed very attentive toward the status of our order and kept us updated all throughout. The order was then brought to me directly by the manager, James, who was very kind and apologetic. I told him I truly didn't mind, he was thankful but still insisted the wait was too long and would have preferably had my food out sooner, it made me feel like my meal was actually being specifically cared for, and might I add it came out absolutely delicious. James later came back out and offered to buy us any dessert, on the house, as Mark had heard us talking about the churros when we first sat down! I was delighted to have such an awesome experience at a casual dinner. Great people, great food, practically made my week!! It was one of the best date nights my girlfriend and I have ever had. Thanks to Mark, James, and everyone at Macayo's!! 5 star restaurant service, without thinning out your wallet. :)"}
{"text":"Once my plane landed in sunny Arizona my friend knew without question where I wanted to go for drinks and food.  The food is always great and I love that they bring out warm chips and salsa made two ways- mild and spicy. We ordered appetizers as well and it was all great. In the two times I visited I would say during this visit that the service was on the slow side, but a problem with my meal was addressed by management efficiently. I would not hesitate to go again and I hope this won't be my last visit."}
{"text":"Two and a half stars.   Macayo's is the bastard child of a well intentioned tex-mex kitchen with a TGI Friday's.  I've never really been a fan of tex-mex in comparison with the genuine article, but even for tex-mex standards Macayo's falls somewhere between \"blah\" and \"ew.\"   The only forgivable reason I can conjure up to spend a significant amount of time here would be in a large group, maybe with your whole softball team, to kick back and eat brightly colored chips with bland salsa and sip on reasonably priced margaritas.   Outside of that, I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"So, a meal at the Macayo's in north Scottsdale, for whatever reason, always was a one-way ticket to Diarrheaville in my experience. Maybe the employees were angry and washing their dirty hands in the salsa buckets. Don't know, don't care.  The Macayo's on Central (of ugly Mayan-themed building and President-dining fame) is different. This is the Denny's of Mexican food - always good, always middle America, lots of screaming kids, lame attempts at kitsch. I find that takeout is a much safer way to indulge in the artery-hardening goodness Macayo's has to offer.  There are many, many much enjoyed references to dear God, as well as the Mother Mary and her revered child on Yelp. Well, if the sweet baby Jesus was ever to ejaculate, it might taste like Macayo's Baja sauce, and I mean that in the most flattering manner, i.e., SBJ might also spout forth with Cinnabon frosting. Baja sauce is this cream-cheese based, vaguely sweet, vaguely spicy green chili-tinted fatty goopy sauce that can be ladled on virtually any plain Jane item... thus turning water into wine, or some business like that. The green corn tamale slathered in Baja sauce is a most guilty pleasure that always leaves me feeling fulfilled, but slightly unsettled and a tick guilty mixed with a dash of naughty. It's the one-night stand of condiments, no doubt.  So on nights like these, where my weekend's diet has already been ravaged by Harlow's, Delux, and the pseudo-red velvet cupcakes I made at home (chocolate cake mix + red food coloring), I just gotta say WTF -- Macayo's takeout it is."}
{"text":"My restaurant experience this past Saturday (9-24-11) is summed up by the Fountains of Wayne song Halley's Waitress.   \"Halley's waitress never comes around She's hiding in the kitchen She's nowhere to be found I just want some coffee Is that too much to ask? Halley's waitress is not up to the task.  And when she finally appears It's like she's been away for years. It's been so long, So long. Darling, don't you know We miss you when you're gone?\"  Substitute Halley's for Macayo's and Waitress with Lisa and it's uncanny.    My grandparents took us out for lunch. We were promptly seated at a table with plates, chips, and salsa but no napkins or utensils.  Lisa greeted us and took our drink orders. A considerable amount of time passed (all of the chips and salsa had been happily consumed) before Lisa returned with our drinks. Ten more minutes passed and we were left with empty chips/salsa bowls. During that time, we networked with other servers in an attempt to acquire napkins, utensils, and more chips/salsa.    Granted, we had a large party (eight adults, one kid, one toddler) and I can understand how busy working in the service field can be, but our drinks (which cost roughly $2.50 per drink) sat bone-dry for most of the time we were there. Even a pitcher of ice water at the table would have been helpful.   I can forgive a lack of drinks, chips, and salsa but what truly irked me about our experience was when my grandfather's order was messed up.  The rest of us received our food (and ate it, for the most part, without any drinks) while my Grandfather, who would be footing the bill for his entire family, sat without any food, chips, salsa, or beverage and waited patiently for his order to be ready. Lisa even came back out a third time to verify his order. No one apologized to him, there was no offer to comp his meal - in fact, the incorrect order was still listed on the bill.   Despite the way he was treated, my grandfather left a 20+ percent tip because that's just the kind of man he is - not because the service warranted it.  Aside from the recent one-star service, I can't pan the restaurant itself due to one bad experience. I've been there a few other times before and the service was excellent. (I wish I could remember the name of my prior server because he was top-notch.)  The food is traditional Mexican restaurant fare, but good. Their shredded beef tacos and cheese enchiladas are excellent. The Baja Burrito and Quesadilla are delicious too. I'd certainly recommend Macayo's restaurant, but if you sit down and your server's name is Lisa - head for the hills!"}
{"text":"Macayo's has great food at any location, but my favorite location is the pyramid on Central.  I believe this is the first location, that has been there as long as I can remember. Get there while you can, because they will be tearing it down, soon."}
{"text":"One word, Nasty. I came here with a large group on October 4th. The service was pretty poor (he did not clear dirty plates and kept on bumping me when handing over plates, drinks, etc). He also left our table halfway through taking orders to get drink refills for other table. The worst part was the food, bland, odd textures and just overall yucky. My friend and I both had food poisening and others felt really sick. Yuck, yuck, yuck!"}
{"text":"The Najaf sauce was excellent, We loved the enchiladas and the nachos. It was so gooood. Love the margarita mugs, too. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit after some doubt reading reviews here on yelp. Seated right away with a great table with fireplace next to our table. Chips and salsa were fresh made and awesome had to have two baskets. Had chimmichangas which were average and combo plate with taco and a tamale which I enjoyed a lot. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"With so many mexican cuisine choices...don't ask me why we chose to eat at Macayos. The food was bland and the service was so so. No reason to rush here for dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"The 1 Star was for the Mahi tacos that was the only thing that was great about this experience. Being from San Diego I am spoiled when it comes to great Mexican food and service. First off when you order a shot Put it in a small rocks glass not a plastic cup that you make jello shooters in! Serve real salsa and guacamole Please for goodness sake! If your going to call yourself a Mexican establishment then do it right! Please hire a waitress that has a brain and isn't slow! If it wasn't for the fact it was a go away party I would have never stepped foot in a such a dirty establishment.  WORST MANGO AND STRAWBERRY MARGARITAS EVER!!"}
{"text":"This place is one giant meh, especially so when put up against all the actual *good* Mexican places in the valley.     This place is to Mexican food what Olive Garden is to Italian food."}
{"text":"Please, Please bring back the Brava sauce. Our Family has stopped coming since those and the tamale bites have been gone. Any chance?"}
{"text":"Went here for Cinco De Mayo for a a margarita. They were pretty good and not over priced. Very cool looking building! Service was pleasant but overall the restaurant wasn't overly impressive but I would still go back agian!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch to meet up with my wife's cousin.    We ordered the chili relleno lunch and cheese enchilada/groubd beef taco combo, which my wife and I shared.  Food was good and so are the margaritas."}
{"text":"They recently got a new executive chef, who has contributed some fun new recipes that are spinoffs of classics. They do have a taco deal on Wednesdays (99 cents) and a deal for seniors.   I enjoyed our experience, even though it was a busy Friday night. Our server, Jose, was wonderful. He was attentive and knowledgeable with a fun sense of humor.  I ordered the jicama shrimp tacos (one of their \"platos pequenos). I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it is not for someone who comes super hungry, as it's three small tacos.   Overall, a good place, but not the best Mexican place I've been to. Their guacamole was fairly bland, for example."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican. The margaritas were good but a little pricey being a probably mix."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Have a menu for gluten-free options which was great,"}
{"text":"I cheated and read reviews before going, so I knew to order the Nachos Supreme which were really pretty good.  Well, at least, I gobbled them totally down as quick as I could. Big serving with lots of toppings, too. If you want jalapenos--and the mild kind in brine like I like--just ask for it. Good food, good service...it's ok...not fabulous but ok. Been here since 1945, so they must have some fans out there."}
{"text":"The ONLY Mexican chain I like. It seems like Macayos has been around forever. Sort of a Phoenix area landmark.   The salsa is okay. A bit mild and tomatoey for my taste. The \"hot\" salsa is a joke. It is not even close to spicy. To me authentic salsa ALWAYS has a bite.  Most of the food here is mediocre. What stands out to me and allows me to give it 4 stars are the tamales with the baja sauce. This baja sauce is amazing. Creamy and spicy, the perfect match for their slightly sweet corn tamale.   The margaritas are pretty good too. I like my margaritas strong and was at first disappointed that I couldn't taste the tequila. Halfway through the drink it hit me like a freight train. It must not have been mixed properly.   Macayos is a good place to take out of towners. They will get a kick out of the kitschy, slightly tacky decor. And the food is suitable for gringo tastes."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid. I always loved the decor, but more importantly, the salsa and refried beans. It's tried and true. When my husband and I don't feel like going on a dining adventure (we love trying new places) this is where we come -- with our Bob and Cha Cha margarita glasses in tow! Their chimi is awesome and big enough to share.  I'm not loving their recent \"modernization\" and menu change. But we'll be back."}
{"text":"Just okay-I went for a retirement party and was disappointed with what we paid for what we got. I like the location on Thomas way better and the servers were way more helpful too!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Phoenix Arizona"}
{"text":"I worked there when I was 17, we times have changed but this place is still the same but more run down, you can feel the wood in the seats because the cushions are so worn out, the food is horrible and the service is not much better! Old and worn out restaurant"}
{"text":"The food is usually pretty good here, but the service tonight was terrible. We waited for our bill for 30 minutes and no one stopped to check on us. We were parched the whole time too!"}
{"text":"For those of you that are not aware Macayo's has a new 'concept.'  It stinks!!  The menu is different, the chairs and tables are different, the signage and paint on the exterior is different however the carpet is the same the old tile is the same and the restrooms are the same.  A very half assed attempt.  When we asked to speak to a manager about the changes we were met with aggression and zero empathy.  As a result, we paid for our cocktails, refused the food and left the restaurant.  Even though my family and I have been going to Macayo's for as long as I can remember we will never return.  My family tradition has been ruined!"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Phoenix I was so excited for great Mexican food, coming from New England, that shouldn't be too tall of an order. My initial search for \"Best Mexican Food in Phoenix\" actually brought back Macayo's (this was long before the days of Yelp). I tried Macayo's a few times and it was ok, then I moved on to greener pastures.  Fast forward 5 years, many mexican restaurants, and a major diet change and I am at Chase field enjoying a veggie burrito, beans, and rice all courtesy of Macayo's. I actually craved it the next day so finally we decided to head to the original location and give it a whirl.  The building is quite ugly but I liked that it at least seemed to have some character. The inside leaves some to be desired, the atmosphere just blows. I don't care if a place is kitschy or mildly tacky but the whole dining setup just feels awkward. The cantina actually looked a bit more lively but we still opted for the dining area.   The waitress was actually very friendly and well rehearsed if nothing else, can't complain there. Come to find out they don't have the veggie burrito that I enjoyed so much at Chase Field! WTF?! The salsa here is good but the chips are kind of bland. The meal was decent but I kept wondering why I can't have what I had from the menu at Chase? My girlfriend's side of rice also tasted funky, again the Chase rice was much better - what is going on here?!  The best part of my meal was actually the house margarita. It was slightly sweet but had enough tequila in it and went down nicely.  I hate to say this but Chase Field food is actually better then this place, the sad and ironic part is it's the same restaurant!"}
{"text":"The renovation looks really well done and the staff seems better than they were before. I wouldn't consider it five star yet, but the effort is there despite being short handed on my last visit and the new lamps over the tables need dusting (the iron looking ones).  Food was on par, I took some guests from home there tonight. They enjoyed it and appreciated the authentic Scenery.  I've come back for another try and glad I did. Although it's not my favorite, it is close to my house and a lot better than it used to be. Glad to see them making an effort. Good luck."}
{"text":"I like coming here. The food is great (and authentic). Drinks are awesome. Service can be hit or miss at times, but if you're not in a rush it's ok. However, the last few times here the service has been great. So hopefully they are improving in that area."}
{"text":"DOUBLE-X BLACKLIST. Three years since my last visit (not long enough apparently), and it's time I updated and upgraded Macayo's to DOUBLE-X. See you in 2014 beeyotches.  Where oh where have your owners gone, Macayo's? What happened to the quality of food with which you opened and on which your franchise and brand name are founded?  FIRE your kitchen staff, FIRE your kitchen manager, and FIRE your general manager.  Mediocre, bland, sometimes scary, late, cold, not clean, goopy, old and stale.  --cardboard menu cards are wet and starting to mildew from days and days of moisture; --salsa 4 to 5 days old. the salt has made it briney, the green chilis are fermenting it into vinegar; --special \"top shelf\" fresh-fruit texas margarita is a swirl of gatorade-colored syrup and a complete waste of grand marnier; head to Quick Trip instead; --rice from weeks ago, reheated, refrigerated, reheated, refrigerated, microwaved and then served from oblivion; dry, cakey gloopy SHIT. Shame on you!; --refried beans go the same way. ranch style. they keep for weeks out on the ranch. didn't finish them? no problem. just throw in a bit of lard and put 'em back on the fire. Macayo's clearly has the technique mastered. --chicken \"guisado\" so old, even cooks from Diamonds wouldn't serve it; --flour tortillas either not fully cooked, or kept in the same damp room as the menu cards -- they were doughy and starting to ferment; --sopapillas for shame! looked like fried cowpies. you couldn't force feed me this shit! SEND IT BACK!!!  After dining at the mother restaurant, you can be sure I'll think twice when I see the Macayo bird on something at the grocery. BLECH."}
{"text":"Not happy. Fish taco had 95% cabbage on it n barely any fish.  Gave me 20% discount. Hahaaaaa not getting that again but friends food was good."}
{"text":"I grew up going to this place and I've always loved it. I purchased the Bob and Cha Cha margarita glasses that allow me to get discounted margaritas every time I go. Their chips and salsa is the main reason I go--I think it's the best in the valley! They also just added these rolled tacos to their menu which I plan on getting every time now-they are so good! Additionally, I have never had trouble getting a parking spot."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience having our rehearsal dinner at Macayo's.  Jayne Gallegos helped to coordinate.  We picked a simple buffet menu (fajitas, fresh fruit, chips/salsa) and they set up the patio area in our wedding colors.  The staff couldn't have been nicer and our guests were very happy with the party."}
{"text":"The Spirit of the Old West Alive Awards have held the last two months events at Macayo's Mexican Kitchen and everyone (30-40 attendees)was very happy with the food. Friday nights can get busy but our service has always been great! JT takes good care of us dealing with everything from special requests to hanging banners.  The food is always wonderful! Hot and seasoned just right. Generous portions and plenty of chips and salsa. The Margaritas are perfect. I can't say enough to thank Randy for setting up screen and projectors, and making ours a nice evening for people who keep the spirit of the old west alive.

{"text":"What a wonderful evening we had at Macayo's... where do I begin. I get a little bit of a daze when I think about Macayo's mostly because I felt so warm and welcomed when I was there. Everyone working there is so friendly and cool. I love the creative interior and the restaurant itself feels like an modern adobe.   We were celebrating pre wedding, and it was a full house.. friends family, the whole shebang was out. Everyone was hungry and happy. Macayo's had a beautiful and plentiful array of salsas, fresh tortilla chips, and guacamole for everyone to enjoy. Once the buffet was unleashed it was just utopia.   Must try: THE TAMALES.... holy guacamole, I don't know if I want to know what's in this because it tastes so good it has to be bad for you. One of the best tamales I've ever had in my life. Who would've known. There are a few to choose from and all of them are winners.   They had other basic Mexican food staples: beans, rice, asadas, poillo and those were all deliciously divine too, but I HIGHLY recommend the TAMALES.   Tips: The parking lot can get a little tight, so Uber is a great alternative. Also using uber is smart to prevent poor choices when under the influence. Check out Fate Brewing near by and Ernie's. Both are within 1 mile from Macayo's."}
{"text":"Sometimes, the best way to feel good about your life is to see how bad off others have it.  This is why I propose you take a trip to Mexico this weekend.  More specifically, Rocky Point. Just a short four-hour drive from Phoenix, it's there you'll become acquainted with what a real shit-hole existence looks like...up close!   Unfortunately, that's not the only perspective you'll gain from your travels.  You'll also have the added pleasure of experiencing what real Mexican food tastes like, realizing how the watered-down, Americanized version of what you've been eating all these years is anything but Mexican.   And that brings us to Macayo's. You'll like Macayo's. Do you know why? Because it's safe.  Not too mild, not too spicy. Perfect for your white-bread, milk-toast, American tastes.   See, Macayo's has been around for over 60 years. Unheard of in the restaurant business. And they didn't do it by frying your taste buds, or making you shit like a sick goose the next day. They did it with consistent menu items, like their red and green chile, or their chicken poblano...perhaps their most flavorful items. And their spectacular margaritas, chips, salsa, and chile con queso are also honorable mention. In short, while it may lack authenticity, it's certain to tantalize your taste buds, just enough to make you come back for more...next week, the week after, and the week  after that.  Added note: Economic times being what they are, a trip to Mexico may be out of the question for some. Even if you do have the money, there's always the prospect you'll never come back alive, dying in a hail of some drug overlord's wayward bullets.  For this reason, I recommend South Phoenix as an alternative to Mexico, where I'm sure you'll find a place that'll give you Montezuma's revenge, burn your mouth and bum, get your car stolen, and leave you in the street sobbing like Mo'niique did in \"Precious\" after her mom beat her with a shoe."}
{"text":"We had a large group for Mother's day. We had called ahead, so they had a table ready for us. Great! That was the only thing that went smoothly. Drinks took forever and were incorrect, so had to be sent back. Food took forever, and two entrées were incorrect and had to be sent back; one ordered very emphatically NO cheese and got everything with cheese, another ordered black beans and cilantro rice but got refried beans and Spanish rice. After those got fixed we waited about a half hour for our check...which was wrong. Finally, after complaining, a manager came to the table (they had never stopped by previously) and redid the check AGAIN. Although some discounts were offered as an apology, we still waited to pay for longer than the meal itself took. In total, the entire dinner took close to 3 hours. The food was ok, but nothing is exclusive to this location so we will NOT be returning to Macayo's Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We come here on an average once a week and always leave feeling wonderful.  The food is great.  I think one of my favorite things here is that along with the salsa they also bring out hot sauce for the chips. Sometimes they forget, but you can ask for it.  It's the tastiest stuff. Cant get enough.  My girlfriend and I usually do the baja chicken burro but have also recently got the mini chicken chimis.  holy deliciousness batman!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now with work homies. First time, not bad...second time, wow. I'm slowly getting more experienced with true Mexican food, and my favorite stuff is found at stands/trucks and Mexican greasy spoons.  This is only the second dine-in place I've been to, with the other an authentic restaurant in Tucson. Anyway, my first time here I got mahi tacos and the wings.  I dunno why I ordered the wings or why I thought that'd be a good idea at a Mexican restaurant.  They were only OK, with no real kick or anything to make them unique in any way. The tacos were great, though.  All I can remember is the caramelized onions going so well with the sweet fish.  It was really a great dish. Second time around I got a carne asada chimichanga.   Wow.   There was a spinach queso sauce all on top with melted cheese.  I could've put that sauce on the drink coasters and enjoyed myself.  Unbelievably delicious!  The meat in the chimi was seasoned well and quite tender.  It wasn't a crispy chimi due to the smothering of it in that wonderful sauce, but it all came together to make an incredible meal.  Even the beans were good, and I don't like beans.  Oh and their guacamole...so fresh.  I slathered it on top of the chimi and it impossibly made it even better.  This was honestly the best chimichanga I've ever had. We went during happy hour and sat in a happenin' spot with a DJ and all.  Music was loud but varied and he was taking requests.  We got our theme song 'September' by EWF played and it made for a really good time.   Waiter did his job decently.  No complaints there. The chips and salsa were much better this visit...the chips were actually warm and the salsa thick.  We didn't get refilled as quickly as we'd liked, but oh well. Their menu has a lot of great sounding things on it and makes me want to come back again and again just to taste everything that caught my eye.  The prices...well, this is central Phoenix so I guess they are the norm.  I'm cheap so its a bit much for me.   The coworker we were taking out was super hungry and was really looking forward to coming here.  He left quite happy and I'm glad this place didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Been to this location several times, food is awesome, however the service is unfriendly and slow everytime (waiting for a hostess to seat us, once waited 15 minutes to be greeted by a rude server) aside from my last visit. Came here on Valentine's Day, the server Hailey was awesome & super friendly, shes the only reason im giving this place 4 stars instead of 3. Definitely will be back because of her!"}
{"text":"A little rocky at first, we sat at the bar for a while before being served during a non busy time.  We caught happy hour by just minutes and ultimately the service was very friendly.  Margaritas were great, and I am not a huge margarita fan.  The prickly pear margarita was very tasty.  The margarita flight was a great deal as well.  Guacamole, and taquitos were basic.  Salsa and cheese crisp were subpar. Overall, we had a nice time and would recommend for good drinks and cheap eats for happy hour."}
{"text":"Great experience good food. I tried fajita bowl it was really good and my beau tried baja pizza which is secret dish not on menu ;) and it was awesome really crispy base and we had to get some guacamole mmm. They gave plenty of chips and salsa on the house which was really nice."}
{"text":"Our office decided to celebrate Cinco De Mayo with some good mexican food.  The closest place was Macayo's.    We ordered a platter to go.  It was a hit in the office.  We all chowed down on some mini chimis beef & chicken, mini rolled tacos, and mini tamales.  Very tasty, meat was moist, and the breading a little on the sweet side.  Chips and salsa were flavorful.    We added our own virgin margaritas to the mix and had a party.  Would love to go again and get more."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment. My order was wrong.  When I called she laughed and said my fault.  When I went for the replacement I had to ask for they tried to charge me and argued with me about the Baja burro.  Instead of wasting more of my time to contact management I will never go back after 25 years of Baja burritos.  Poor customer services. Almost insulting."}
{"text":"Oh man, am I the only one who loves Macayo's??    They have great chips that are always served extremely quickly, and delicious salsa that they will readily fill back up.  Whenever my coworker and I feel like eating fatty, unhealthy food, we always go there for the Baja Burro - oh my gosh...so good!  It is a burrito, filled with either chicken, steak or shrimp, covered in baja sauce and cheese.  Its freaking delicious!  You can also get a bean and cheese burrito Baja Style if you choose and they will add all of this deliciousness to your bean and cheeser.  I want to go for happy hour and try their new watermelon and honeydew margs because those sound delish.  Anyway, I totally recommend this place for a quick lunch, I've never been disappointed and never left even remotely hungry.  In fact, most times I feel I need a wheelchair."}
{"text":"Stopped in at this location on N. Scottsdale just north of Shea and was very impressed.  Great, unique dishes.  My favorite was the Pollo Chilorio, possibly one of the best Mexican dishes I've ever had."}
{"text":"I was very excited to see Macayo's at ESPN Fan Fest in Scottsdale yesterday until I was charged over $28 for 2 drinks.Even in Scottsdale, that's the most I've ever had to pay for drinks. If this is what I have to look forward to at the restaurants, I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with a friend and overall everything was great.  The service was semi-slow, having to ask twice for random things, but other than that, the food and atmosphere were good.  I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 1/5 Happiness - 2.5/5  i have been here twice, year's apart. And I think the most recent is the last. They do seem to try hard, but living in a state with an over-abundance of incredible options, it is a shame to go to Macayo's (which wouldn't even be top notch on the East Coast, where I am from).   I ordered a combo of a burrito and taco. The taco was fine, but reminded me very much of a Taco Bell taco (and for double the price). But the burrito... oy! I am fine with grease on my food, especially given my love affair with real-deal New York city pizza (where no grease is not an option, at least, not if you are doing it right). But this burrito was practically swimming with it. To the extent where it seemed that they had taken the pan that they used to cook the ground beef and dumped all the contents into the tortilla - including the entire pan's worth of grease. With each bite, a new layer of orange grease would rise to the top AND drip out the bottom corners. I couldn't eat more than half. My wife got the chimichanga and it quite simply lacked any crunch. I know Macayo's says this is their signature dish, but it is simply a woeful offering. The margarita we ordered was delicious and looked great too.   I love the building. The outside is really fun (it looks like an ancient Latin American temple) and the wait staff was truly nice. But quite simply, there is no reason to revisit."}
{"text":"Food was great . Customer service was an awesome experience, Jayna was so polite and craig is a excellent bar tender and he has great social skills and hes a definatley people person"}
{"text":"We also celebrated at Macayo's today for Cinco de Mayo.  We hadn't been there for some time and not since they worked on and updated their menu.  As I was leaving I spoke to the greeter at the door and mentioned that I was going to go home and write a review on Yelp. She cringed at that and asked if everything was OK.  She recovered quickly when I told her that we were quite impressed with the new menu, service and appearance of the restaurant. As this was Cinco de Mayo and there was a crowd, service was spot on and food was out in a reasonable amount of time.  We chose to eat at the bar because that's where we always liked to eat.  Heather was one of three bartenders and very personable. She honored my request that she not pack my Margarita to the brim with ice as many restaurants do (resulting in maybe 2-4 sips). Margaritas were also improved, not as sweet as before.  Making this our new/old favorite Mexican restaurant. Appetizer nachos are more than enough for two and served with queso dip, guacamole and tender beef"}
{"text":"Yes a large party of 11 is difficult so I made a reservation and we had no trouble getting a table Sat @6. But they messed up our orders a couple of times until the ladies said forget it and they I brought them anyway. The manager came over and nicely said they wouldn't charge but they were on the bill. So thats confusing to get the bill straightened out.  Otherwise the food is ok our friends really like Macayo's."}
{"text":"If I found myself in a nightmare where I was lost in the never ending corridors of the Mall of America and stumbled across a Mexican restaurant, I imagine it would be exactly like Macayo's.  As to why anyone who lives in Phoenix would want to spend their money at this place when there are literally hundreds of quaint, authentic family owned Mexican restaurants in every part of the city is beyond me.  Okay so the food wasn't too bad and it's probably consistant as well.  In fact I'd give the food a 3 since I'm not too picky but the utter soullessness of this place was almost too much to bare!  Green Day was blasting in the bar area where we were seated...and to be fair, I don't mind GD but come on, in a \"Mexican\" restaurant?...and at full volume?  Maybe it was just a poor seating arrangement and it would've been better in one of the other hundred or so rooms.  More than likely though, this place just isn't what I or any other self respecting lover of Mexican food would consider a good place to eat.  If you love going to theme parks and if you enjoy frequenting night clubs and you want to combine this into your false illusion of a good Mexican dining experience, by all means come here and you probably won't be disappointed.  But for everyone else who actually possesses an ounce of dignity when it comes to where you eat, please do yourself and the local ma-pa Mexican restaurants a favor and visit one of them instead."}
{"text":"There shouldn't even be an option for a star. The service is horrible and bartenders are very rude. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone not even my worst enemy!"}
{"text":"This would normally be a 2-star review, but I appreciate the theatricality of the building and the interior decor enough to give Macayo's the extra star power.  The exterior looks like it was pulled off of the set of \"Legends of the Hidden Temple\" (an old Nickelodeon show), and the interior is either somewhat boring mexican restaurant (the main dining area) or guffaw-inducing dramatic lighting, tiered seating, giant wooden parrots, and a nightclub-esque glowing bar (the \"Aztec\" room). I overheard the waitress tell another customer that they have DJs on 2 nights a week. Makes sense.  The food is... well, it's like everyone says: cheesy, intestine-blocking, Ameri-Mexican cuisine. I almost hurled when I asked the waitress what was in their \"baja\" sauce. It involved some kind of cheese AND half and half. I decided to get my green chile tamale with green sauce instead. It was good, but a little sweet. The Chile Relleno was... subpar. That dish is generally a good barometer of the quality of a mexican restaurant, and theirs was soggy and drenched in melted cheese. Don't get me wrong, there's a fond place in my gut for gobs and gobs of delicious cheese, but it's not really 4-star dining.  Their drinks are... large and filled with tequila, but remain largely unoffensive.  Exactly what I expected."}
{"text":"We ordered from this place through Delicious Deliveries and it was great! My husband and I loved the tacos and the black beans were delish :) Will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"It boggles my mind how drastic the quality of Macayos has dropped in the past 10 years... the food, service, prices... if I had any authority over any employees last night, I would have fired all of them. RULE#1 of bartending... polish your glasses. They dont do that... SERVERS- we dont want to see you stuffing your faces in the side stations... and for future reference.... let your guests finish the appitizer. Managers- are you around anywhere? Our cheese crisp wasnt cooked in the middle.... luckily Macayos hasnt changed the recipe for the baja sauce- got them 2 stars instead of 1. This is my third bad experience in a year and it just gets worse everytime I give another chance. So as much as I used to love this place, I cant go give my $ to a company who cares more about their decor than quality....they just dont care."}
{"text":"I like the charm of this particular Macayos It is dated but I'm pretty sure all the Macayos are... It's part of their own history and adds a lot to their uniqueness  This restaurant is huge, inside and outside  I was really surprised at how big it was haha On our dinner stop the restaurant was pretty empty which was great because we were starving and had already drove all the way up from Tempe  The hostess seated us upon walking in and our server was very prompt as well  She was nice and very knowledgable of the menu  After looking at the menu I got the enchiladas and refried beans Well That was after I devoured the chips & salsa  We put our order in  And Our food came out in about 10 minutes Maybe even quicker  And then I finished my food in maybe 5 minutes haha I was so hungry One of the managers brought our food out and she was very, very nice   Overall it was a nice meal and nice ambience   I kept looking at the bar and thinking \"how drab\" but I'm sure their happy hour prices make up for it :)"}
{"text":"Espy our server made our first dining experience here more than exceptional, we had a great dinner and all of her recommendations were fantastic! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Macayo's is OK. It's not the best Mexican food I've ever had but certainly not the worst. My sister and her boyfriend are really into this place so I come here from time to time and  it's always just OK. You know how those places are? Like someone says \"Hey, let's go to Macayo's!\" and you're all \"I don't hate it there and I'll go there if you have your heart set on it.\" It's literally one of those restaurants that if I never went again, I'd probably never even realize. The salsa with the free chips and salsa is pretty bland, I do like the fundido sauce or whatever that deliciousness is on their chicken burrito. The mini chimi's were decent and the meat on the nacho's is pretty good. The service is not that great. It's never been horrible but you get the sense that the server is counting down the hours until they get to go home. Which, I get it, being a server isn't the funnest of jobs but at the same time, it takes very minimal effort to give the impression that you care and are happy. Anyway, that's my two cents!"}
{"text":"Excellent food for the price. The patio is a great spot for eating at an outdoor resturant. Happy hours with an appetizer an drinks are inexpensive. Overall a great experience"}
{"text":"So, my girlfriend came into town to help me move home, and she wanted to get some Mexican food.  I immediately thought of Macayo's, because I've been here before and love how colorful their interior was.  We walked in and were seated right away.  I was expecting it to be a bit busier for Father's day, but alas, there wasn't much going on here.  Our waitress was great, and we started off with chips and dip, and eventually ordered some dinner.  My girlfriend went with the Chicken chimichanga and she loved it! it looked really good from where I was sitting!  I went with the Nacho supreme, and it was tasty! My friend also got a margarita which looked nice as well.    Overall, we had a good time here, and I enjoyed it. Our food was awesome, the service was pretty good and this place isn't half bad."}
{"text":"No, no, no, no. That's all I can say if you are planning on eating here.    My daughter and I went in today, on a Sunday afternoon, because we couldn't find another Mexican restaurant that was open on Sunday in central Phoenix. The service was fine but the food was awful. The beans tasted like they came from a can (Rosarita brand) and the salsa was just barely palatable for the same reason. We each ate only half of our food before  leaving.    When the waiter asked how the food was, I told him and all he did was say he was sorry. No offer to bring something else or comp one of our half-eaten meals.   Macayo's on Central used to have fresh food, now it is just stale and tastes like it comes from a can. You can definitely tell that they are cutting corners in the kitchen. For the prices they charge, You have a right to expect better food.   I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Was ok, wasnt great wasnt bad either. Service was great ! Had the verde pork enchiladas. That is all."}
{"text":"I've never been to the restaurant.  Only the bar. Now, there are A LOT of bars where I live.  Great bars, good bars, dive bars, crappy bars.  The choices are endless.  Since I work full time and go to school full time my time and funds tend to be limited.  When the funds are especially limited the choice is clear: Macayos. Here's why: Macayos' happy hours makes my last few dollars last.  Drinks are cheap and food is free.  That's right kiddos, free.  Because every college student appreciates an establishment that does not make them choose between booze and food this is very important.   Now, is the the best food you've ever had?  No.  It's free, stop being so freaking needy.  It's good, even great for what you just paid, which I'd like to again remind is nothing.   During the week the bartenders are friendly and attentive. Friday nights this place tries to turn into a club and is overrun with older women freshly released from their cubicles, on the prowl.  It's a little alarming.  So I tend to stay away. But during the week it's relaxed, cheap, and friendly.  Who can ask for more?"}
{"text":"I don't normally go to restaurants looking for an \"authentic Mexican\" or an \"authentic Italian\" flavor, although I'll note it if I find it.  What I'm looking for is good taste, and on my 2 visits to Macayo's  when I was in Phoenix, I found it.  On my first visit, I had a very tasty two tacos, beans, and rice.  On my second, I had the enchilada sampler.  This latter was not entirely my taste, although I still thought it was good quality.  I have been to quite a number of Mexican places around the San Francisco area, and this was my first experience at Mexican food in Arizona.  I was quite pleased with the food here--and I got a LOT of it.  For what it lacked in \"traditional\" or \"authentic\", it made up for in flavor and meal size.  The decor at Macayo's was a bit loud, but not unlike some of the other Mexican places I've been to.  This is a great place for good single, couple, or family dining.  Give it a try and taste for yourself."}
{"text":"Service was great.  It was busy yet we were seated quickly and our waiter was always on top of things. My tortilla soup was good but nothing wowed me. If you want average run of the mill Mexican food here is the place."}
{"text":"We are long time Macayos customers but recently moved to this side of town so this was our first time here. I really wish we knew our waitresses name, but lost our receipt as we had a big vacation the next day. Our waitress was AMAZING. We really appreciate good service since my husband and I grew up in the industry and recognize it when we see it! So whoever our waitress was (young lady with dark hair)- THANK YOU! (In case you missed our note on the receipt). She was prompt with our order even though it was busy, but we were especially impressed with her follow up. Our drinks were never half full and she was very kind to our toddler daughter (who can earn us some assumptions eye rolls from servers these days). The food was delicious as always, but as you know the service is what makes or breaks the restaurant. We have since returned and had an equally pleasant experience but we're hoping to bump into our other waitress next time! You just don't see service that well now a days :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Macayo's for dinner and we both where impressed by our waiter. (I wish I remembered his name) He was on top of everything despite it being a very busy friday night rush. He brought us waters right away and was very attentive throughout our meal. The food was delicious, I had the chimichanga and my boyfriend had a shrimp burrito. The shrimp burrito is not on the menu but our waiter said he would make it happen. We where very satisfied with our experience and will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"It's not the best Mexican food, but it really hits the \"I need cheese and carbs\" spot. I do have to say though, the green corn tamale bites are amazing! Stay away from the frozen margaritas...you'd be better off going to Circle K and getting an Icee.  The only thing I really dislike about this place is the service. Although the waiters are always friendly, they always seem to be super slow.   On a side note, one day I would like to get really drunk and (attempt) to scale the outside \"steps\" on Central."}
{"text":"If you've been here and didn't like it, go again and try anything with their BAJA SAUCE.  It is one thing that is AMAZING.  (Shredded Beef Burro with Baja sauce or Green Corn Tamales with Baja sauce are top pics.) Tried Baja sauce at other places in the valley, and nothing compares.   The place has Bright Mexican decor.  It's not fine dining, but it's not meant to be.  Comfortable and casual. Salsa is ok - but ask for the hot and it's even better. Service may be spotty, but the $3 margaritas (when you bring in your Macayo's glass) are a deal... Oh and the stuffed animal grabber machine at the front door is a rip off - no grip - just eats your money so avoid it!"}
{"text":"If you're hungry for tradition, I wouldn't go here.  While this location was the first one in Phoenix, I think the food has gone downhill. I'd rather go to Carlos any day than have dinner at Macayo's.  The food is just okay. The chips are just okay. The salsa is just okay. Nothing stands out as being really good, except maybe the margaritas. If you purchase a Senor Bob or Cha Cha mug, you can get discount margaritas with every visit. But that means you actually have to tote a Mexican man or woman shaped mug back with you each time you eat a meal here. My mom actually has both Senor Bob and Cha Cha....  *sigh* I prefer to just to buy a margarita any time I'm here and they're pretty good. I like the frozen strawberry and the classic rocks/salt marg.  If you're looking for a fun after work happy hour spot, the bar area of Macayo's is freaking hoppin.'  It's so busy that it can be a little tough to even find a parking spot.  I think they have a little buffet and drink specials during happy hour. And as it gets later on Friday evenings, the place almost turns into a little club. People start dancing and the music blares. If you decide to go, just look for the Mayan temple look alike on Central."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this restaurant for the past 12 years but it's where my parents would always take us when we were in town. So I have good memories of my mom and I bringing our Bob and Cha Cha refillable margarita glasses here back then. We decided to take the kids there tonight to share the memories... Sometimes memories need to stay just memories. I don't think there has been one single upgrade to this place since before we used to come here. My chair was broken, the table needed refinishing and let's just say I didn't feel comfortable setting my purse on that carpet. Long story short, the margarita mix was bottled, the food was bad and the server was, let's just say quirky. Even my 9 year old daughter said her kids menu cheeseburger wasn't good...  Honestly the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the chips were good and the salsa didn't suck."}
{"text":"It's been six long years since I last had a Chicken Poblano. That is far too long to wait, I know, but I moved to Florida. Today I am whole again!  Our visit was good. Nothing spectacular, nothing amazing, but it was just darned good.   I came in with my wife and my grandparents and Macayo's was the place both my wife and I NEEDED to go to.  Our server was on top of our requests, the food was just as I remembered it and boy did it hit the spot.   I've loved Macayo's for years, and I will continue to as long as they are this good. Now I just need to go and buy about 10 cans of the enchilada sauce to send home."}
{"text":"I used to come here literally once a week. My staples were the cheese crisp, chips and salsa, Red Corn Chicken Taquitos, Cheese Enchiladas, Chicken Maxamillian and I have tried just about everything on their menu.   I was here opening day at this location. I used to LOVE and adore Macayos. Until about one year ago. They hired a new manager. It started with a lot of great waiters who knew me by name dropping off like flies. Still, there were a few left and I perservered through crappy service to get the food. NOW every SINGLE time I go the soda is flat, the cheese crisp is not cooked correctly, and the service is aweful.   It has steadily been becoming worse and worse since Anne, the manager started. I'm not trying to attack her personally but clearly she is not doing it right. My chips are always cold and I have even walked out because it was so crappy. This is coming from someone who has gone to Macayos since BIRTH. For 23 years I have been 'frequent' and since age 18 I went literally every or every other week.   I LOVED Macayos, it was my FAVOURITE in the world, and now I cant stand to go.  It used to be a friendly, happy family atmosphere, with good food, awesome service and bubbly fizzy soda. No longer. Not since. I have tried and tried again to relive the glory days, but I think it has seen and passed them. I went to Macayos in Tucson and it reminded me of when this location was great. Sad times.  I have literally spent THOUSANDS here. But now I wont spend a penny, unless I hear management has changed."}
{"text":"The 1 star is for customer service.  The food was moderately good.  We ordered catering for a party.  The food was picked up only to get home and find that they left out several items.  We went back to the restaurant and was given no apology and told that they too had discovered that food had not been included.  No apology and no call to us that items were missing.  The food was not that good that they should be so arrogant."}
{"text":"Very authentic. Large and decorative interior. My favorite was the porch where we decided to sit. The food was phenomenal, almost as though I were eating an actual fish taco made in Mexico. Fresh homemade salsa and chips beforehand were a nice way to welcome us and allow us to stay awhile. However, giving us all our own salsa dish made me not find it desirable to order an appetizer. I certainly don't mind though as they get plenty of service and guests. They seem to know where to get their money. The only improvement I can see is the decorations. While the environment is comfortable, the authentic food didn't seem to match the décor."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was fair.  We ate in the bar area, and a server from the dining room walked in, grabbed a cocktail napkin and blew her nose... Right there at the bar.  We weren't the only customers in there, either.  So it's ok to blow your nose in front of the bar customers, but not the dining room ones?"}
{"text":"The food is okay, but Americanized.  Even Señor Taco is much better and a whole lot cheaper.  Kind of disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been visiting Phoenix 2-4 times a year since 1988, and almost every visit has included a dinner or drinks at Macayo's for yummy food, refillable margaritas mugs, and what my wife says are the best fish tacos anywhere. We normally go to the W. Thomas location, but when we're uptown, we'll stop by this location which is a little more old school.  Like blackboards and ruler spankings old school."}
{"text":"Blech! Eek! Yuck! Went here last Saturday with my compadres, Myles M, Kristin S and a few others. We had been day drinking substantially and still thought the food was barely edible. Having grown up in California, I am completely aware of the variety of \"Mexican food\" that exists. I've had true authentic food with cactus, Americanized Tex Mex like they serve at places like Chevy's and drive-through places like Filiberto's, and I'm ok with eating at the less authentic end of the spectrum. That being said, I still expect my food to be made with decent ingredients, to be flavorful and to be a good value for the money. And the food at Macayo's is none of those.   The special shrimp burrito we got had a decently spicy sauce, but the tortilla was soggy and greasy. The Spanish rice was the worst I've ever had. My friend's \"grilled veggie\" fajitas were overcooked, mushy, STEAMED veggies like carrots and broccoli. What a curse to be a vegetarian in this joint! The house salsa was OK but I've had better from a jar.   The only saving grace of this place was that it was crowded and lively on a Saturday night (always something I miss dining in Central Phoenix). The pitcher of margaritas we got was also decent and not too sweet.   Sorry, Obama, and sorry to everyone else who gave this place a decent review. Macayo's sucks and I'm not afraid to say it."}
{"text":"Three because meal was excellent, or it would be a 2.  Desert was aweful.  Fried ice cream was ice cream rolled in cornflakes and honey.  Flan was bland and almond slivers were charred."}
{"text":"You know, not everyone likes ABBA. But if you look at their record sales over the last 35 or so years, it seems like most people do. Still, they just are not and have never been cool. Despite an almost universal appeal that should point up some universally-regarded good qualities, they still get no respect.  I bring this up because in some quarters Macayo makes a mighty fine target. Locally they are like the ABBA of Gringo Mex.  And yet . . . they've been around HOW LONG??   So Macayo does far more right than they do wrong.  Check out the Steak Cortez or the Chicken Poblano and tell me it's not tasty. Order the fajitas and hear them come out of the kichen sizzling and sounding like a million bucks, and tasting like . . . well, like $14.95 or whatever. You get your money's worth.  So is Macayo's a destination? No. It will never be cool. Is it a reliable place for a good meal well-served? As they would say in Sweden: Säkert."}
{"text":"We were suprised after being referred to this restaurant that is a disappointment. The first thing that we were taken back by was the girl that seated us. Not friendly at all! Did not smile even once! (our appt. was 1:00 PM, January 1, 2017) The second thing was the floors were not vacuumed  as there was debris under each table from the previous day/evening.  Unclean, and a turnoff! Third, was the obviously unprepared for management! Here it is, New Year's Day, staff is short with three waiters gone.  Forth, the entrance had a sand filled cigarette concrete disposal that was full of plastic drink containers, straws, and other garbage that had not been cleaned out prior to opening today which was 1:00 PM. Very untidy in appearance, unvacuumed carpets, etc.  We frequent numerous Scottsdale, and Phoenix restaurants. After this experience today, we will not be coming back. (honestly, and reapectfully submitted)"}
{"text":"This is not my favorite Macayo's location in town, but it is a solid choice for a quick lunch in the area. Easy to get in, great lunch deals, good service, and a dark relaxing atmosphere. The chips and salsa are particularly good too."}
{"text":"I've been going to Macayos for the past 20years. Not sure if they are under new ownership or management but the menu has changed drastically. It's just not the same.  Had the chicken pablano, one of our favorites although it had an inch of breading on it.  Took all of it off just to get to the chili and chicken. I guess it's time for a change. Macayos please bring back your old menu!!!!"}
{"text":"As far as Mexican chain restaurants go, Macayo's is alright.  The chips and salsa are decent.  The food is just okay, if you ask me.  I wouldn't come here if it's real, authenic mexican food that you're looking for.    And seeing that Mexican restaurants in Arizona are like Starbucks in San Francisco (every corner), I would hold out on the real stuff ;)."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Macayo's many times on Scottsdale Rd. and Shea and love to take my out of towner friends there.  Lunch or dinner, the food is always good, the host and servers are responsive and friendly..and the food...is very very nummy.  I love the beef burro enchilada style, but am crazy about the new salads they have.  Their taco salad presentation is very good.  When I ask for my order to be tweaked, they get it right.  I highly recommend Macayo's, never a bad meal and my guests are always satisfied and love it.  This place should be packed day and night, but I've never had to wait and always had good service."}
{"text":"The waitress was good for our big group, service was great, but I wasn't impressed with my food at all. Bland red sauce, not crispy, and not served hot."}
{"text":"Near my office.  I go here for lunch from time to time.  Service is quick and food is ALWAYS good.  If you are in a hurry, sit at the bar.  They seem to take REALLY good care of those at the bar.  ;-)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the authentic Mexican cuisine that this place had to offer. The Margaritas where top notch! Gotta try one"}
{"text":"I love this place! First time sitting at the bar, and last night they had a fire going and My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our Margaritas and appetizers!! Even though Tara the bartender was slammed she made us feel like we were friends sitting in her kitchen!! Everyone was so friendly and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Scottsdale location for a chicken California burrito, tasty. Location is OK but once again another location needing to update its dining rooms."}
{"text":"First time at this location and I loved it. The interior is fun - they'll be moving to a new location soon so I hope the vibe sticks around. Our server, Julie, was fabulous. She was extremely attentive and friendly. Definitely recommend coming to this location and the new one once it opens."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I went to Macayo's for lunch and it was delicious! I stopped going to macayo's because of a bad experience in the past but they made changes to the menu and the service was much better! Our server Julie Hurtado was friendly, knowledgeable, and fast. We will definitely be back for lunch."}
{"text":"Macayo's has been a family favorite for years!  There staff is always prompt, friendly, and courteous.  There food is nothing extroadinary, but is always consistent (you always know what you are going to get each and every time!).    They are constantly bringing back chips and salsa, where as other mexican restuarants seem to slack off a bit in this area.    Their margarita mugs are a good deal, you can bring em back each time for a $3.99 refill and then upon departure they will rinse out and bag up for you.    Overall I reccomend this place.    Side note:  I attended a rehersal dinner here and they were great!"}
{"text":"The bar:  Very disappointed.   Music too loud. Too ethnic. Poor set up with entrance outside the restaurant.   I used to \"happy hour\" every weekend in years past ... What a change, will never go in the bar again...no class whatsoever.     What happened?"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I've been coming to Many Macayo's locations and this is one of my favorite. The manager, Jim is always very personable and cheerful and the wait staff has never given me any cause to complain. Tonight I had Martin as my server and I could not find a single thing to complain about. The staff is at my table when I need them and gone when I don't. The food is excellent and I am addicted to the Baja Pizza and the Pork Verde Enchiladas. I would recommend this place to everyone, and I often do. Much better than Tacos and Tequila!"}
{"text":"Good place.  Friendly staff.  It has a nice little bar with a few TV's to watch the game, which is a lot to ask in Midtown Phoenix. :)"}
{"text":"I'm in love with the green corn tamale with baja sauce. The management goes out of their way to make sure you are taken care of. I always know that I'm going to get good service and quality food."}
{"text":"Walking into Macayo's is like entering a buffet restaurant in a Vegas casino. Tacky, tacky, tacky. Loud wall paper. Lots of different rooms. And the people. Oh, the people! Men in Hawaiian shirts or local team jerseys. Women with big hair and lots of screaming kids. Staff is usually quick to greet and really quite friendly. Standard Mexican fare is widely available. Stick to the combo platters and you may leave happy. The carnitas entree is a sad clump of dry pork...gee, I think that's the same thing my Uncle Larry said of his third ex wife. Anyhoo, the chile con queso is quite yummy and actually not on the menu. You have to ask for it. Served with a variety of blue, yellow and red corn chips, the dippin is fun and filling. The guacamole is pretty good although it seems there's a little filler in there therefore the avocado flavor suffers a bit. I really like the mini chicken chimichangas. The minis, not the regular sized. The latter are a bit tough and big and hard enough to use as a door stopper. Macayo's is a family owned, famous Phoenix restaurant landmark. The Central Ave. location happens to be in my hood and sometimes the convience outweighs the dee-lish factor. My recommendation is two shots of chilled Patron before the food and everything seems better. Hola and adios!"}
{"text":"Once a month my group looks to find a local restaurant to host up to a dozen individuals after our event.  We have come to Macayos several times.  Honestly always hit or miss.  Earlier this summer I called to make reservations and got confirmation. Then when we arrived we learned that somewhere in the conversation I was supposed to confirm. There was never that discussion. We WERE confirmed when I hung up.  Kudos to Macayos, they opened a room for us and we were able to have dinner.   Tonight though, no excuse. There were 5 of us. At the start we had our beverages and chips/salsa. Then, wait, wait, wait. Waitress comes back and takes our order.  Table next to us gets seated with a family of about 12.  We wait.  Table next to us gets their dinners. (Odd)  We start to get our food Waitress comes by asking if we need anything. She says soup is on the way. I order a wine.  My husband ordered soup, which came about 10 minutes later cold.  Never got my wine.   So we then wait more for the checks.  Took toooooo long. Will say poorest service I have had in a long while.   Going with 2 stars as the food was good."}
{"text":"As my daughter would say, \"It's all about the Baja sauce!\"  To be honest, I've never been a huge fan of Macayo's, surprising since I've eaten there so many times through the years. My reasons for coming back? It's comfortable. It's convenient. It works well for multi-generational family gatherings. It's a great place for a birthday (free dessert and server serenade). Chips and salsa are prompt and plentiful. And it's not bad. Just ask for a side of Baja sauce with anything you order and you'll be fine.  The Scottsdale location is very nice, nicer than most Macayo's. The structure was specifically built for Macayo's and it shows. There's a patio, bar area and inside seating. It use to be much cuter, with a colorful menagerie of animals placed up in the rafters, but it remains attractive. Still, our family still misses the animals.  Speaking of families, the $4.69 kid's meals were a big hit in our most recent visit. Actually one meal, a mini combo platter, that a four and a five year old shared. They've also enjoyed constructing chicken tacos in the past. A meal that's also an activity! Once again, one kid's meal served two young children nicely.  We also have a habit of ordering appetizers as entrees. On this particular night, two of the six in our party ordered the mini chimis as their meal. With Baja sauce on the side (of course) instead of sour cream. Both also opted for a mix of both chicken and beef chimis. The Baja (of course) pizza appetizer is also a good choice.  One suggestion if you are a first timer: Ask for hot sauce when your chips are delivered. It won't be offered, but it is happily served. This sauce is a nice contrast to Macayo's normal mild salsa. The hot sauce is tasty and is sold in many local grocery stores, even Costco on occasion, so you know it has some merit..  With kids sharing meals and adults ordering appetizers, our dinner tab was very reasonable. It could easily balloon, of course, if you ordered more and added Margaritas... Given its Scottsdale location, the cost could be much worse.  Perhaps not a destination in and of itself, but Macayo's is a good place to enjoy friends and family."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary.  We had a shredded beef taco, chili relleno and ground beef enchilada.  We barely made it home.  We were violently ill.  They told us we could come back for another dinner.  When we did we were treated horrible and totally ignored.  They obviously don't like complaints, however, we were ill again.  I will never go here again.  I think the Health Department needs to sniff around."}
{"text":"Another great meal today!  The food is always good & you can count on that ever time!  Great quality, consistent & great service. They know how to do it right!"}
{"text":"A Macayo customer since 1983 - this location from about 1984. Well, it was a good run, Macayo's, but - sadly - I'm done. Here's why:  So let's give you some good for starters: arrived roughly 7:30 p.m. on a weeknight. Your dining room was all but empty. Your hostess greeted us with a friendly smile and seated us right away. Summer menu in play. Chips, salsa and drinks served promptly. Good quantity for the price. More good? Nope. Sorry.  Your remodel was only a couple years ago. Why are the booth seats already falling apart? Wow you did not get good value for your money with those booths. Or, you didn't pay much and the cheap material you got is already falling apart. That does not make your diners feel good.  Server was Gary. Sorry, Gary, I usually only mention a server's name when they do a top-notch job. Gary, Gary, Gary. So you appeared quickly. That was good. You recognized us; that was impressive. You thought our last interaction several months back was a good one. We do not share that opinion. That time was a late night and you were very much in a hurry to get done and get gone. Tonight you were friendly. You did forget to put the appetizer order in and we only got it after our entrees were served and we had to comment. Was it really busy earlier in the evening? You sounded exhausted from having worked so hard!  Chips glistening with oil. Salsa seems to be not up to par - getting more liquid with each passing visit. Not expecting pico de gallo chunky but do recall it being a bit more chunky.  Steak fajitas. Darn. Cooked to death. Beyond well done. Zero flavor and tough as shoe leather.   Carnitas. Something I've been ordering for just about 30 years. Darn. Cooked to death. Dry as a bone. No flavor.  Gaucamole. Wow. I just don't understand restaurants that feel a need to stir in a whole bunch of random ingredients. Cucumber? Huh? Cilantro, I get it - just don't think it belongs. Cheese? Really? Pico? Oh, come on! Avocado, lemon juice, salt and done. KISS.  Check brought on a clipboard. Not your fault. That is a decision of management. A bad decision. Aren't the folios that most restaurants use freebies from credit card companies wanting to advertise their cards? But, you brought the check before we were about 1/2 done with our entrees. \"I had fun with you guys tonight\" is what you said on presentation. Huh? How? No suggestion for dessert. Hey, management, if this is S.O.P., your servers are costing you a lot of profit! Oh, Gary, we'd have gone for dessert. But, you didn't give us that chance.  You didn't notice that the steak fajitas were barely eaten. No query as to why especially given that both of us had commented about wanting \"big\" dinners tonight - that was a hint that we were hungry! No offer of a to-go box. That's OK, had we wanted to take the leftovers, we'd have asked. But, they weren't worthy.  I was really hopeful for a good experience. Darn it. I was down to this location as the last of your locations worth going to. Well, buh-bye.  I so wish I could give you advice on what to do that would start filling your dining rooms again. Freshness of the food - not over-cooking (are you freezing and/or microwaving?) would be a good start. Why not own the fact that you were one of the first to offer mini chocolate chimis for dessert? Put it on your menu with pride. It is - was! - a signature item. No manager made the rounds of the dining room tonight. Maybe that was because only about 6 tables were seated. Still, that should be S.O.P. So, it's food, it's your people and it's your decor. Probably too much and probably too late.  Too bad. It was a good run. I hope you find a way to stay in business. As for me, I've moved on. And, I'm not happy about that. I don't think my taste has changed all that much. The Macayo's experience from 30 years ago is nothing like the experience in recent years. Woody would be embarrassed."}
{"text":"Sooo they have changed a few things here. They still have the Mex and Match but rellenos and tamales are no longer on the list. So what I ended up doing was ordering the two tamale plate (green corn with baja sauce) and asked if I could get soup instead of rice and beans. The result was an amazing bowl of soup and tamales which turned into leftovers because it is a lot of food. It seems they have a happy hour thing now with cheaper apps and drinks."}
{"text":"Mexican food is Mexican food.  I bring my kids here and they like it.  Large enough that the wait is usually short.  not a bad place to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"The margaritas which Macayos calls \"the best in Phoenix\" are not. That's the nicest way I can say it. Just don't waste your money on them.   The food is decent but bland. The guacamole was excellent.   Problem is that any good Mexican food joint that can't give me a good margarita is OFF the list.  The server was decent but they only had about half the service staff they needed."}
{"text":"I must have gone on a bad day, because this is possibly the worst mexican food I've had. Honestly, tasted like Taco Bell on a poor day. I ordered a California burrito, for almost $10. The tortilla was stale, and the flavor was just not there. Being from California, I'm offended that they call this a California burrito! Other than that, the salsa was not fresh at all, and I'm guessing it came straight out of a can. Not even a jar-- a can. Overpriced, stale fast-food. How has this place been there so long?! I felt robbed after seeing the bill."}
{"text":"Was very very disappointed with this location. My mom and I came here to eat before we were going to a basketball game downtown. The restaurant was not even half full or busy at all. First of all the table they sat us at wasn't cleaning and had chips, salsa, salt, and ice all over it. Our booth was equally gross. There was hair stuck up in it with food. Ew! Plus it was sticky. After trying to get a waiter over for ten min to ask for them to clean it up they continued to ignore us or pretend not to speak English or that they would go get someone that would help us. 30 min after sitting down someone finally came over to clean the table and to take our drink order. Mind you with no apology or anything. 10 min later we finally got our bottled beers which were lukewarm. At that point we ordered two chimichangas. I kid you not over 40 minutes later we dis lot for our food. Which I will say was as good as the other location we went too. It was their only saving grace. As soon as they served it we asked for the check. They never are over to ask if we needed anything or to even fill up our drinks. No silverware and then when we got it I had food on my knife. Our waiter was rude, unhelpful, and could give two cares about the fact that we were obviously unhappy. First time in my life I haven't left a tip. We will never ever go back! Not to the one on central. All others may I say are impeccable! Just stay away from the one on central ave! I've never seen such a filthy and unprofessional restaurant."}
{"text":"I've had different experiences at this Macayo's.  It was hard to give the amount of stars on this one.    All times I have eaten a meal at Macayo's, the food has arrived in 8 minutes or less of when I ordered-- this is really great for lunch on M-F when I dine here on work days.  I've had a few lunch meetings here and we were able to get seated quickly and hold a conversation at a normal level, so that is good too.  It's not too loud and the restaurant is large enough to find better seating should you not be satisfied.   My last dinner here was not so good as lunch.  I had the fajitas and they were just off, not right.  Can't pinpoint exactly what was wrong with them but I will probably never order them again.  I'll stick with my taco salad and try not to eat the bowl, Do you know how hard it is to not gobble that greasy taco salad bowl?  It's hard."}
{"text":"It's like Denny's but Mexican.  Food is salty, which makes it good.  Chips are ok  Margarita's were great  Atmosphere reminded me of a bad Miami Vice episode shot in Mexico.    Not a bad experience, but definitely better choices out there."}
{"text":"I usually have a good experience at this Macayo's, but I was very disappointed a few days ago. Poor service, dirty restroom.  The only reason for the two stars is because of the food. The quality of food was quite good.  Other than that, I must say Macayo's seems to have lost their service skills."}
{"text":"I went here on the 4th of July with a huge party (my family). When we entered they had a kids pool full of nasty water up front because their roof was leaking...not so nice. The waiters were nice, allowing us to go to the bar to order our apps and drinks in order to get hh pricing and dealing with our giant party. Unfortunately, the food at Macayos is just not very good and is WAY overpriced. I got the baja chicken quesadilla and it was fairly dry and bland. It also took a huge amount of time to get our food (but I understand that due to our party size and the fact that it was a holiday). If it were up to me, I probably would not eat at Macayo's again....but I know I'll probably end up back there at some point. Please don't let your friends convince you to come here! With all of the Mexican food options in Phoenix, there is no reason to come here."}
{"text":"Looked forward to some good Tex-Mex style Mexican food. Had eaten here once before and enjoyed it. Our table ordered fajitas, tacos, and enchiladas. We orders at 6:00 and waited almost 45 minutes to get our food, though the place was not exceptionally busy. When the food arrived it was lukewarm. The waiter forgot the vegetables side-order and went back to the kitchen to get it.  We saw him again as we were finishing our meal. He had a plate of mixed vegetables that looked like they had been sitting in the kitchen since he first delivered our order. I obviously rejected them; we were done.   The service was terrible and we might as well have gone to Taco Bell as far as the quality of the meal went.   Hope I can find my next Tex-Mex fix somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food was good...typical Macayos but the service was truly the worst, most awkward experience I have ever had(and I work in the restaurant industry). I left a 10% tip which I have never done in my life. Starting with being sat, my mother wanted a different table and the girl said \"I was just taking you to where the hostess told me.\" I don't care why...a more proper response would be absolutely or okay would have been a better improvement. Then comes our server...that's where the real awkwardness and bad service starts. This man should not be in the service industry, in fact he probably shouldn't be in any profession that deals with people. A couple highlights...he dropped off my moms food and then said he had the wrong dish for me and had to go back to the kitchen. During this time I watched the \"wrong dish\" just sit on an adjacent table...I'm sure someone else was wondering where it was. He comes back a few minutes later and shocker...forgot my dish. Comes back a few minutes later with it. Forgot my moms baja sauce and comes back with that. It was cold(my mom didn't realize that it is supposed to be cold) so when we point that out...our server in a very condescending way let us know that it is cold and if you want it heated up, you need to let the server know. Well ok we are letting you know and we'd like it heated(not a smart ass) response. Came back with it and it was still cold. Finished eating and needed boxes...waited no joke 10 minutes before I flagged someone else down and we got them right away. Waited for our check..got that and paid. We had 3 boxes and two little containers and our server didn't offer or bring a bag(not that I expected it). I will not go back and I've been going there my whole life because I would be terrified I would get that same server. I get the same quality food without the really weird, awful service at another place a block away."}
{"text":"Flat, old tasting soda. Burned cheese crisp. Watery salsa. Congealed re fried beans. Hair in rice. Peeling paint on walls. Half assed service. No Cholula sauce.  Pass. Do not enter. I should have read the reviews first, but thought the outside looked retro and fun. That's Yelp karma..."}
{"text":"The place is tired...I guess that's why they are moving. The food was good...I wasn't that hungry so I just had an enchilada with beans. The margarita was not very good tho."}
{"text":"I was intrigued by the cool looking architecture of the restaurant, and decided to give it a shot, since I enjoyed the meal at the Tempe Macayo's. Because Central is under construction, it was a bitch to get to, but once I made it, there was ample parking (probably because nobody wanted to brave the construction). I had a green chili burrito and a carne asada taco combo, which came with rice and beans. The chips are good quality, and excellent salsa. Not too runny, not too chunky. Kinda like Goldilocks.... I had a couple reasonably priced Nergo Modelo's during dinner. The Taco was the best part of the meal. Hard shell and fresh, ample amount of cheese, tomato, and lettuce piled up on top.  The atmosphere is your typical Mexican Cantina, with festive colors of green and red and yellow. I'd definitely give it another go-around, but probably swing by the Tempe location."}
{"text":"1 Comment  Sort by   Top    David Parker   I ate at Macayos restaurants since 1954, starting at Woody's El Nico and finishing at Macayos on Central in 1983. I ate there every day through those years. I ate lunch everyday at Macayos on Central starting in 1960. Mary would have my table ready for me and the waitress would bring my lunch out without me ordering. Woody use to sit with me and complain about the cost of the cheese for cheese tortillas. Then one day I got one with very little cheese on it. He hollered at the waitress to take it back into the kitchen and put some cheese on it.

{"text":"It is possible to get really bad Mexican in the SouthWest. I rarely ever get burned with my food choices, but score one for Macayo's Mexican Restaurant. I was in Phoenix for five days and had three incredible mexican meals so just figured the odds of getting bad Mexican where similar to the odds of getting a bad slice in NYC. As a result, I let my guard down and went to Macayo's for no reason other than that it was close to my hotel. I'll never be that careless again. I knew I made a fatal mistake when I walked in the door: The place was huge and there were only people at five tables. The atomosphere was that tacky overdone carribean mexican feel with lot's of turqouise and other clashing colors combined with busy carpet. The gringo that took the order was another sign that this place was about as authentic as a made in china sticker. The salsa quite frankly was the worst I ever tasted. I would have begged them to bring out a bottle of Pace if I thought they had it. The chips were equally bad. The menu was completely unimaginative. I ordered a pork burro which came with absolutely nothing in it but bland laying in the pan pork. I paid $2 more for enchilada style which was supposed to come with sauce and melted cheese over it. In places where that kind of things worked the sauce is usually a deep red, here it was a depressing rust color that lacked any flavor. If there was melted cheese over it, there was so little it dissolved in the rusty sauce. My girlfriends Chile Relleno, which I didn't taste, was the worst she ever had. In a place where incredible mexican is the rule, I would venture to guess the over/under for this place staying in business is hours, and if it's not it deserves to be. AVOID!!!"}
{"text":"Out to eat with friends from work.  Really good food!  I had the Combo plate:  2 little tamales, 4 mini-chimi's (2 chicken/2beef), 2 taquitos, and spinach queso dip.  Brought some home!  Service was good."}
{"text":"Although the food here is pretty good and affordable, the service is consistently lacking. Almost every time we've come, we end up waiting a while before getting help and there's not a lot of check-in, causing you to wait a while for drink re-fills, more chips, etc.  We come here once a month or so with friends who love to eat here because it can be vegan friendly, but otherwise wouldn't choose to come here on our own over other Mexican places.  All that said, if you're looking for a place to get good Mexican food that won't make you sick at great prices, this is your spot."}
{"text":"My family and I have always loved Macayos. This location is always clean and friendly. Most of the time we are seated immediately or within 5 minutes. The food is always great too."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate with a party of 15 and they wouldn't let me in with my daughter because after 4 PM it's considered a bar. Security was extremely lazy in getting management when I wanted to speak to him. Finally he came and explained its the law I understand and respected that so I asked if I could just speak with my party for 5-10 minutes before i left since I drove there and they would not let me eat and was declined. Never going to recommend this place to anybody since not even a simple request could be made, I know it's the law but you can bend it a little for the customer and afford a 5-10 minute conversation."}
{"text":"While to some folks its less \"authentic\" vibe is a problem, to me it's perfect.  I have taken several folks here, who are not originally from Arizona and had never liked Mexican food, and they leave here liking mexican food.  To a girl who could eat Mexican food 5 times a week and not get tired of it, getting my family and friends to like Mexican food with me is VERY important.  While some of them have evolved to other things, for others this remains one of their favorite spots - with their Chimi's always being a #1 pick.  Maybe it's just me, but I like a little kitch now and then.  Bring on the chili lights strung around a fake cactus.  It's a ploy to make it seem safe to the gringos.  Just like the food.  Nothing to spicy.  Nothing to scary.  We're all here to have a good time.  See the funny stuff on the wall?  We're your friends.  The bar area can get super packed.  And for Cinco de Mayo it's just crazy.  If you don't want to be squished on the dance floor, the only way to do it is to go early because by mid-happy hour the place is packed.  And the DJ's have been a bit hit or miss.  Some of them have played some great stuff, but others.... not so bueno."}
{"text":"Solid food and service! The service at the bar was top notch. Daniel and friends helped me out. Daniel, the bartender, is an amazing guy. He is personable, knowledgeable and just super cool to chat with. I enjoyed him so much. The other servers were also just as friendly and kind. They made an out of towner like me feel right at home. I went in for bean and cheesy goodness and got a lot more than that. My burrito was delish. Margarita-amazing. I'm a simple girl so if  the beans are correct then the burrito is awesome. In this case, they were. I didn't try any other dishes so I can't speak for how they tasted. I went on a Sunday around 2pm and it was pretty dead. But I got to chat with the staff who are all so cool! Glad I stopped by! I'll be back again when my job sends me to Phoenix. Thanks Daniel! You rock and so do the bean and cheese burritos, chips, ambiance and all of that."}
{"text":"The worst service ever!!! They were rude from the beginning. We came here after Beer Fest for food so yes we had been drinking but we were in no way causing any scene or acting inappropriately. They said my friends eyes were too weird for her to get a drink but she didn't even order a drink! Then a different waitress asked for our drink order but didn't come back for our food order for a long time. She was much better and much nicer than the previous waitress but then she disappeared AGAIN when we needed our check! We had to flag down a manager who was very apologetic about our awful service and removed our food off the bill.  I appreciate them making an effort to rectify our bad experience, but I still have a bad taste in my mouth about the service. I gave two stars because the food was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"Having tried Macayo's tacos at the taco festival a few months back, decided to stop by for lunch since it was on the way home.  Since this is my first visit, I can not compare the food to how it used to be (but I am sure it has changed over the years due to numerous reasons).  I ordered the carne asada taco platter which was very good.  It came with 2 different sauces, one red and one green. Both were good, but I decided on the red which I think pairs better with beef since it had a nice smokey flavor to it.  The rice and beans were served in a bowl together which was a little odd instead of on the side of the platter like on the other dish that was ordered by my friend which provided a slightly larger portion.  In any case the food was excellent, the service was very good and the decor was very nice.  Since Macayo's is only a 5 minute drive away from home, will certainly be coming here more often to eat."}
{"text":"Eh... no. This bright colorful restaurant is kind of cute, but the food leaves much to be desired.  The cheese crisp should be skipped. It's a fried tortilla covered in Velveeta (or some other processed cheese). There's no flavor. Salsa tastes like it's made from canned tomatoes. Chips were fresh, on the plus side.  I think the entrees were better. Chicken chimichanga was OK. The rice was fine, too. Carne asada tacos had a decent tomatillo sauce, but the beef was tough. Black beans seemed canned, but the mixed vegetables were actually pretty good and well seasoned.  Prices were high relative to the food you receive. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"chicken pablano and baja sauce are the bomb.  I've been to Macayo's well over 100 times and NEVER had a bad meal.  Fairly priced, good food and good service."}
{"text":"I came to Macayo for restaurant week, and I was very happy with one of their dishes that had chicken inside a grilled pepper.  It had a fajita tasting type of feeling but the combination of the pepper gave it a nice kick.  The dessert we got was a fried ice cream and it reminded me the taste of Cinnamon Toast crunch.  It gave me childhood memories."}
{"text":"Macayo's is yet another Mexican place in the valley which is just right there on the line with what I consider \"average\" Mexican food. There's nothing wrong with being average; it just isn't something I'd want to be known for.   It's the type of place where, if you live close by it'll probably work in a pinch if you're in the mood for Mexican... you just won't leave wowed. There's nothing wrong with the food, it's alright... just not unique or fresh enough to really cause you take notice. Comparatively there are places like 'Rosas' in Mesa which have flavorful dishes that actually stand out and make you want to go back.   This location has been pretty consistent, and the wait staff are fine; I just can't justify going here more than once in a blue moon when there are quite a few other Mexican places that have much healthier and flavorful options for about the same price."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I have ate at this restraint for many years . But different locations . I have moved into the area and was happy to see we had this Mexican food near us. Well I was shockingly disappointed . First off I want to state the service was terrible. It took over 25 minutes for someone to even approach our table for drinks . I had to get up and get a manager to be waited on. Then when we got our food again disappointment as it was not up to par with good food. I decided not to write this place off as maybe this was a one off and the manager replaced our food.   A few weeks later myself and roommate decided to get take out. We both got the steak  fajitas. Might I say we spent $18.00 and it was just gross . The meat was not cooked the other food was over cooked . At this point I called the manager to advise of these bad expirences. He apologized and that was it ! No offer to remake it and come back in . No offer of a refund for disappointment , nothing .   I have now decided to share this with everyone to know this location is beyond bad and to not go here . If I could give it no star I would ! I will never return to this location or any other location again . If this place is not boycotted they will continue to make poor food and make money . It will also allow the staff to know its ok to give bad service when waiting on a table . I hope this helps avoid and future bad expirences ."}
{"text":"Really don't like to do bad reviews but this was a bad experience. Service was ok, but my bloody marry was tasteless, and my chile Relleno was the worse I've  ever had in my life it was extremely oily like they double fried it or when you try to cook something in cold oil. Very bad, there was 4 of us and we didn't enjoy anything."}
{"text":"Love this place! Come here often. Greg and Joey take amazing care of us everyone! Greg knows exactly what I order and gets me and my friends in and out quick as sometimes, were in a rush! Thanks Greg!!! Thanks Joey!!"}
{"text":"Was in town on business and a local friend took me here...so glad he did! This place had great service and great food. The ambiance was nice too. I got the fajita quesadilla which was soooo huge and sooo good! We also ordered the loaded nachos appetizer...yum!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out tonight and got home. First bite into the Baja chicken burro there were 2 chicken bones. Although that is absolutely disgusting when I called them they offered to replace them and give me a credit in which they did. I did have to drive back and go pick them up which sucked. But great customer service, just a surprise with having chicken bones."}
{"text":"Honestly felt like I was about to step into the Titty Twister from the movie 'From Dusk Till Dawn' probably because this is on Central and it was at dusk. I couldn't make out the mural on the outside due to the dimness of light - was it a huge snake or a long dragon. Anywho I had to make a split decision because mom was about to turn into a hangry bear. The women in our family, no food equates to grizzly bears with tiaras about to die of starvation smh. As we entered the long hall there was not a noise so I was a bit hesitant to keep going or turn back. Like any good George Clooney actor I headed forward to take a peek. A waitress pops out of nowhere. A bit relieved we found the hostess area in this long winded still tunnel of an entrance. We were seated and given menus. Restaurant chain menus. I was a bit hesitant again.   My hesitating was disturbed when another group sat down in the booth next to us and the female patron in the group ordered a \"Dos Sexy Amber.\". I listened as the waitress looked confused and the female patron said it very confidently a second time. I thought, \"Is she ordering a stripper? Or a beer? Or is there a sexy bar wench/vampire carrying a snake around her neck named Amber who is twice as sexy?\" Then realised the patron was ordering a Dos Equis Amber.  Received our meals. I ordered the Dos Diablo with machaca beef. It was okay with the exception of the pinto beans that had a strange metal flavor. Probably because the cook is boiling beans and sharpening vampires swords side-by-side. I don't know. My mind began to drift back to the restaurant and the very few patrons consuming their meals ... just like the movie. Very few patrons and then BOOM vampires every where. Just kidding.  I won't be back because it was just a bit too interesting for my taste. Probably because it was on Central in downtown Phoenix. Blast you Los Dos Molinos for being closed on Sundays!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has been refurbished and it looks great !!!! They must have spent the entire budget on the re-make and left nothing to the service and the food !!  The chips were lacking salt.... The queso average at best .... The service very slow (it took more than 60 min to make a burrito) .... And when it arrived it was very bland and really not better than a frozen meal from costco.....There s a Chipotle opening up next door .... They should outsource the kitchen to them and they would do much better !!!   We will not come back for a while ....."}
{"text":"The first time I went to a Macayo's, I was with my best friend and we were like 10 years old.  Needless to say, it's been a while since I last ate at one of their locations, and my tastes have expanded...slightly.  The husband and I came here one weekend at like 2 so it was fairly dead inside.  We were seated in the weird as can be bar area and were inundated with cheap looking hookers writhing around on a beach on the TVs.  Not the best accompaniment for Mexican food in my opinion.  Anyway, I went off their new Mex and Match portion of the menu.  It's a great option for those of you who want to try more than one thing or aren't really sure what to get.  The options are all reasonably priced too, staying well under 10 bucks.  I got a cheese enchilada and a beef tamale with refried beans.  The tamale was very tasty and the beef inside was very good.  The enchilada, I was not too impressed.  The cheese was bland and there were lots of onions in it.  Eww.  The red sauce on top was pretty tame, even for a lightweight like me.  Honestly, I won't be back.  I don't really care for Mexican food, but if I'm in the mood, I think I will go somewhere with a bit more flavor."}
{"text":"Macayos is like Chuck E. Cheese without the games. Lots of kids running around. Young servers navigating first jobs with little supervision and varied results. Often bland or lukewarm food that takes an eternity to order and arrive.   At least at Chuck E Cheese, the kids can run around and bang gophers on the head, or whatever, while you're waiting. Here, you just kind of bang your own head on the table."}
