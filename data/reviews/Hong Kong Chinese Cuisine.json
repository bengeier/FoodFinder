{"text":"The food so far has been Awesome. The veggies are fresh, the rice is light and the Walnut Shrimp is indescribable. Yum."}
{"text":"thought we would try it we had a coupon from them for buy one get one 50% off, we went in sit down and gave the waitress the coupon , she left a minute or two later the owner or manager came out ,and said he would not take the coupon even though it was his and still date good, well i felt like i was being played so we left, i guss that they just dont need new business,it's not like there is  shortage of chinese restaurants in town,for about 2 dollars they may have had a new customer,PS there was no one else in there but us,i all ways thought coupons where to get people to try your place,well to make a long story longer,i am really sorry that we both may have lost out,"}
{"text":"The worst food and customer service EVER!!!! I ordered beef broccoli . There was barely any beef. That's not even the main problem. The food was absolutely tasteless. It was so disgusting that I couldn't even take another bite. I decided to re-cook it and oh you know add some flavor. Even with adding flavor the food was still bad. I felt sick after so I called the place. The person I spoke with gave me a difficult time then we came to an agreement that if there was 50% of the food left he will refund us our money back. There was more than 50% of it left. So he told me he will send the driver to come check if the food isn't finished. Then we get a call from the owner and she said that we need to go to the doctor and get a note that it was food poisoning. I tried to explain to her that the food was disgusting and I felt sick after, and that a proof of food poisoning wasn't needed, she kept on insisting that she needed the proof. I don't understand why the first person I spoke to told me that I'd get my money back, and then the owner calls and changes her mind. What kind of customer service is this? They tell us one thing, and then call back with something else. This is the most horrible place I've ever gotten any food from."}
{"text":"My family and I absolutely love this place! We order from them often, and love how fast their delivery is. It's a tiny little place, but we like it like that. The staff is very friendly and always get our order right.   MUST TRY THE LO MEIN NOODLES!!! They are just perfect. The taste and texture is amazing. The chicken lo mein is my favorite. The veggies are always fresh and delicious. We also love the house fried rice, sesame chicken, and crab puffs. I bought lunch for my mom there one day, and now every time she visits, she wants to order from them.   Great place!! Must try it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Their eggroll tastes like curry. Not that curry is a bad thing, but I wanted eggrolls.  All of their menu items are sub par, and walking into the place will make you regret having eaten there."}
{"text":"Better food than most place, they deliver, good prices, nice people too"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I have had in years. I took the coupon in and had no trouble using it. Very friendly people and VERY GOOD food.  I went there a week ago and could not believe how fresh and tasty everything was. When I walked in I was greeted with a smile, asked if I wanted to have a seat or is this going to be to go. We sat and had one of the best meals I have had in a long time. Went back today to see if that was a one time thing. No, same smile and great service as last week. Ordered the spicy chicken same as last time and it was even better this time around. Hard to believe. This time I also ordered the spicy pork No doubt in my mind, My new favorite. This is the place to go if you want Chinese food."}
{"text":"I don't write a lot of rest. reviews so forgive me.  I don't like eating out but when I do, I eat here. The food is great, especially the happy family-my fav. the food digests well, which is a very real concern for my stomach. I love this place and we eat there(actually get delivered) at least 1 time every couple of months. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery and to my surprise the food arrived within 30 minutes of me ordering!  I ordered orange chicken, beef and broccoli, egg drop soup, and the pu pu platter. The pu pu platter consists of two ribs, two egg rolls, cheese puffs and dumplings! Yummy! The food tasted really good and was super hot. The egg drop soup is really good! Definitely ordering again sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Disgusting food and horrible customer service. I highly recommend any other restaurant."}
{"text":"Love there house fried rice !!  it's the best. They offer such great Chinese food, and good size portions. Their delivery is super fast too. They have excellent chicken dishes as well."}
{"text":"We have ordered from them twice now and the take out is always good and is ready pretty quick!! The chicken lo mein in was the best!! Only thing I've had so far which is normally my favorite is the crap puffs.. They are super crunchy and not much crab and cream cheese!    Update: I've ordered 3 times in the last few weeks and the food has improved significantly! I don't know if it's a new cook or the owner has been in but it has been on point! My new addiction is the honey garlic chicken and the crab puffs were on perfect!! I myself wasn't the one to go in to get the food so I don't know what the difference is but I don't care!! I'll be sure to do the pick up myself so I can update my review with the answer!! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I have ever eaten period. The portions are large, so it's nice for my little family to only have to order a few things and we still end up having left overs. So far everything I have ordered has been great. The only thing I haven't liked in the wontons. I'm not sure if that's how there supposed to be made in this area but where I'm from (Wisconsin) they are a lag larger and actually have fillings in them. Other than that, the people are friendly, the food is done fast and taste great. I would recommend this place for people to try."}
{"text":"I have eaten there once, and that is one time too much.  OK, maybe it was because it was a Sunday night, but that should not be an excuse.  I ordered a simple dish, shrimp and vegetables.  The ingredients were obviously frozen, OK.  It came with a thick and gelatinous sauce that was both tasteless and nasty.  But the worst thing about that meal was the serious case of the trots I got about an hour later and that lasted well into the night.  No thanks, never again."}
{"text":"Hong Kong Chinese Cuisine is the new kid on the block, replacing the old \"Yu's Cafe\" located inside an old Taco Bell building on the NorthWest corner of 19th Ave and Thunderbird. We dug the old Yu's Cafe, and were disappointed in its disappearance, so we gave the new guys a shot and ordered some delivery yesterday.  When I called up the restaurant to place my order, I asked the employee if it was under new ownership, he said it's under new management. I asked if the menu was the same and he said no, it's different. This became evident when attempting to order and when I received their to go menu, as their vegetarian options are now almost non-existent. On the menu under the \"Vegetable\" section, a paltry 2 dishes are listed; Assorted Vegetables and Ma Po Tofu (Bean Curd).  I asked the man if he could make us a vegetable dish with fried tofu and he agreed. I asked what type of sauce options we had and he stated that it would be a brown sauce. It seemed as though they didn't want to cater to a custom order, but nonetheless, I asked if he could do a crispy tofu with vegetables in a sesame sauce dish. He agreed. We also ordered vegetable fried rice with tofu. I asked if their vegetable eggrolls actually contained egg in the wrapper that they used, but he could not or would not verify that for me, which was disappointing. FYI: many eggroll wrappers actually don't use egg as an ingredient.  Our total was $17.XX for the tofu dish + the fried rice. No itemized receipt was provided at delivery.  Pros:  Free delivery within 5 miles with a $12 minimum order Fast delivery No MSG used  Cons:  Not many vegetarian options (please add more!) No fake vegan meats. Please start carrying vegan beef and chicken!"}
{"text":"I wanted to add an update to this review. Shortly after my first review I stopped in to pick up some take-out. They menu had completely changed from the last time I had been in and it had only been a week or so. I thought that was really strange, as the place had only been open a short time to begin with. I ordered egg rolls and chow mein. Sadly the food was not as good. The egg rolls were completely different and the option for chicken egg rolls was no longer available. The food was ok, but not as yummy as it was before the strange menu change. We haven't ordered again but I guess we'll give it another try someday."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food. Very decent prices. Go before 3 pm and the food is discounted by almost half. I go here weekly."}
{"text":"I though it was fine! Nothing terribly special. Had Kung pao and beef lo mein lunch specials. Both were decent but I like my other Chinese ave better in the area. Egg rolls seemed like typical frozen and fried, and lunch combo fried rice could have had a bit more flavor.  If they had their drive through up and working for to go orders that would be REALLY convenient and I might just give it another star!"}
{"text":"I tried HKCC the other day when coming home late from work.   The orange chicken was good, rice was good, egg roll was good.   Nothing out standing but nothing bad. Let's give them a few months and try them again.   The place was clean the food was hot and the servers were nice."}
{"text":"Ordered our takeout via their website, which is very user friendly. Received an email as soon as my order was placed confirming the date and time it would be ready. Showed up just before order pickup time, and our order was ready! Paid online, so I just had to confirm information, sign, and then go home to enjoy. We ordered egg drop soup, which serves 4-6. The pupu platter came with 2 of each item (egg rolls, wontons, crab puffs, fried shrimp, and ribs). We also ordered the beef & broccoli, and honey garlic shrimp. A side order of steamed white rice was included. Everything was delicious, and piping hot! My fingers were burning when trying to hold the containers...love how fresh everything was presented. Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Living in the neighborhood for a year this was a Chinese spot I was anticipating to try out ! Looks like it use to be an old Taco Bell building that now serves Chinese food . Not eye appealing from the outside or in, but the food was authentic and I was able to pick up my food in under ten minutes ! My egg fried rice and Mongolian beef was fresh with lots of flavors ! I even got not 1 but 2 fortune cookies!"}
{"text":"Nothing out of this world, but if you're looking for some above-average Chinese food at a good price I'd recommend this place. Also delivery is incredibly fast."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood and thought I would drop in.  I saw the sign that read now open.  Even though they opened in October.  I ordered the Orange Chicken lunch and it was hot and fresh.  Came with choice of fried or white rice..chose fried.  Came with an egg roll that was exceptional.  The cream cheese filled wonton wasn't my thing.  I prefer the crab puff.  All in all I give this place a decent reating and a good deal for a 7 dollar lunch and it came with a large drink."}
{"text":"I love the food at this location!  I've been here a handful of times since moving to Phoenix and always leave wondering why I don't come more often. From the outside, this place isn't very inviting. Looks old and like it needs a total makeover. The inside is pretty old as well. All the tables and floor look original. Not falling apart yet, just old looking. Since I don't eat in, this isn't a big deal for me.   When I come here, I normally order from the lunch menu as they come as a combo and you get A LOT of food for the price. All lunch combinations come with an Egg Roll, Crab Puff and 2 scoops of fried rice.  My favorite here is their Lo Mein, but their Teriyaki Chicken, Sweet & Sour Chicken, Shrimp Lo Mein, and Sesame Chicken are delicious as well. All their food is well flavored with just the amount of sauce to them. They give generous portions and food comes out very quickly. I've never been disappointed with the food I've gotten from them. Lunch combinations range in price from $5.75 to $6.55.   The staff here are super friendly and always make sure you are happy with your order once it comes out. They make sure your food is hot and ready to eat. They make your food to order, which is very nice for those you want their food a particular way.   They do delivery within a 5-mile radius, but your order has to be a minimum of $12. Orders can be placed online or on the phone as well.  Hours of operation:  Monday 5 pm - 9 pm Tuesday - Friday 11 am - 9 pm Saturday & Saturday 12 pm - 9 pm"}
{"text":"I can't believe anyone would rate this as good food.  It was soooo bad.  the crab puffs didn't have filling in them hardly, the fried rice had no vegetables and was gummy and flavorless,  the sesame chicken tasted like the just poured some syrup on it.  there are four of us that ordered and not one of us enjoyed this food.  none of us ate it and considered ordering out somewhere after just ordering from here.  the other people who left reviews must have never had good Chinese before because i would rate this as the worst Chinese i have ever had in my life.  i can cook better than this.  YUCK!!!! I'd have rather spent my money at McDonalds!!!"}
{"text":"So I have been a long time cutomer (I believe over a year and a half) and I can say hands down it's delicious! The food is fresh, always hot, fast delivery, affordable prices! If you're at home and don't want to cook- definitely order delivery from this place. I personally recommend the hot and sour soup (it has a kick to it!) Also the fried rice is very yummy! 5 stars for great customer service!"}
{"text":"Great place to come to get good food at a great price with friendly staff. I've only been here a few times, but I have always been happy with the food I've gotten. Putting in my order is very quick and easy to do and food comes out quickly and is hot, fresh and very tasty. I usually get a lunch combo, so I get lots of food for a small price. I pay less than $6 (no drink) for a meat, two scoops of fried rice, egg roll, and a crab puff. They are more than generous with their portions, especially since it is lunch sizes.   The building is old and looks like everything is original.  Could definitely use a much needed upgrade. Also, it looks like they used to have a drive-thru, but they no longer have this.   Would definitely recommend this place for a quick and tasty meal."}
{"text":"I Absolutely love this place. It's such a diamond in the rough. My boyfriend and I stumbled a upon this place when we moved into the area like a year ago . The building it self looks like they took over an old Taco Bell so it's not very big but the food speaks for its self and the employees are very nice."}
{"text":"In a pinch... Maybe. Their egg rolls taste like they have curry in them. Their everything I've eaten from them has been bland, undercooked, and/or just flavored weird. One the plus side they are cheap and very fast... Might explain the downsides."}
{"text":"They have the absolute BEST Kung Pao Chicken in The Valley!!!! Everything else isn't bad either. Their prep time is really fast too. I would highly suggest eating here!"}
{"text":"After moving to the West side from Scottsdale, we had a hard time finding Chinese food delivery that wasn't junk. About a year and a half after we moved here, we received a flyer on our door and tried this place. It is SO good! It rivals our favorite place in Scottsdale for fast Chinese delivery (House of Yang)! They are quick, friendly, and the food is delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"Wow, a great find for us. I'm so happy my Husband encouraged me to try this and not judge this old taco bell location turned great Chinese food. Don't bother with Panda, this is the new lunch spot for tasty hot food. No weird meat here, charbroiled chicken was moist and teriyaki sauce was spot on. Did I say moist? Second dish of Cashew Chicken was delicious thick cut chicken and lots of vegetables lovingly floating in a nut infused sauce. Yum. The third dish was Sweet and Sour Pork, crunchy wrapped pork pillows tossed with big pineapple, onions and carrot chunks which are cooked perfect. Each dish served with two large scoops rice and a egg roll. Can you say what a deal for $18.50 Will return and will tell my friends!"}
{"text":"Fast delivery! Fresh & hot food. Delicious and staff are curteous. We got the Mongolian Chicken, Chicken & Broccoli, Shrimp & Lobster sauce. Yumdeli-omcious. Say that three times. Haha"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!!!  Let me start out by saying that I base my ratings off of comparison to similar businesses or expectation. So, i wouldn't compare a restaurant like Honk Kong to a fine dining Restaurant or a PF Chang's for that matter - completely different places. I compare Hong Kong to their competition, the other delivery-take-out/dine-in local, little Chinese food restaurants.   First off this place shouldn't be judged by it's cover: in an old Taco Bell location, in a run-down strip mall, in a little-to-be-desired corner of town. Sadly, the exterior gives you the first warning, then the interior will make you question why you didn't heed the first warning, but hopefully can get passed all of that and get to the good stuff!  We are addicted to: the MONGOLIAN BEEF(tasty beef with delicious spices and LOTS of onions, mmmm), the ORANGE CHICKEN is a comfort-food-fave (not too sweet, but not too spicy), the LO MEIN is just how I like it (soft, chewy noodles and a nice balance of veg and meat), the SESAME SHRIMP is different than I have ever had and I love it (the batter is almost like pancake batter so it's sweet and puffy), the WONTON and EGG DROP soups are delish (always hot and fresh, vegetables still crisp and lots of big shrimp and meat in the wonton soup).   And we always get the \"free\" pork fried rice (currently a special if you $pend $o much) which doesn't seem prepared  any different than you'd expect but it's just delicious!!  The service is also always super friendly, speedy and appreciated - from the phone, to ordering in, or delivery - thank you Hong Kong! See you soooooooon."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time ordering take out. The 1st time I got orange chicken the second Mongolian beef. Both times the food was hot, fresh and tasty! You can't beat the price either. I want to try the chow mein next time but I def recommend this place :)"}
