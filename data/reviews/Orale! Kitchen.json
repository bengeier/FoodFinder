{"text":"Orale! is fantastic. Not only is filled with friendly and accommodating waitstaff the food is outstanding. Fresh and interesting salsa, great chips and their negro modelo beer battered avocado tacos are something out of my craziest food fantasy. 

Absolutely worth not only stopping by, but making a trip specifically to Ohio city just for dinner."}
{"text":"I nEEd more fried avocado tacos!!! yUm!"}
{"text":"I have never used Yelp before, but I signed up after my horrible experience here. First, my boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night. We made a reservation for 8:30 since a Saturday night in Ohio City usually means everything will be packed. When we walked in, there were only two occupied tables. That should have been the first indication to leave, yet I was determined to try this place out after reading previous Yelp reviews. We had three samples of salsa, which were all fairly good and flavorful; however that's where our positive experience ended. We each got margaritas that were far too sweet and incredibly overpriced. My boyfriend got a cup of the tortilla soup, however it had absolutely no flavor! I normally don't care for anything terribly spicy, but even I found it to be incredibly bland. Next, he had the steak tacos, yet stated there was no flavor in those either and they were almost too messy to handle. I got the three enchiladas, which I was told was a new dish and people seemed to like it. This dish was horrible. There was far too much lime flavoring, making it almost completely inedible, not to mention the chicken inside was completely dried out and flavorless as if it had been sitting around for a very long time and was just nuked in the microwave. I barely made it halfway through my dish before I was too disgusted to eat any more. To add insult to injury, this dreadful meal cost roughly $60! I'd rather go to Barrio or even Cozumel than ever come here again. They should truly be ashamed of themselves between the horrible quality of the food and the outrageous prices for meals that are clearly just warmed up in a microwave (we could hear the microwave running in the kitchen from where we were seated). Don't even get me started on the uncomfortable atmosphere! The tables are far too small for even two people and it's so quiet, we were nervous to talk above even a whisper!  I could get the same bad service at a McDonald's for only a few bucks, that is how terrible this place was."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of their WSM stand, so I had to try their new spot.  It's very cute inside.  They did a great job decorating the small space.  There are day of the dead paintings and pictures of Mexican masks.  The walls are the perfect shade of yellow.  It's trendy but still classy.  It's so funny how important ambiance can be.  

Charming interior aside, the food is good.  There is complimentary fresh salsas and chips, with refills.  The smoked salsa was outstanding.  The server also brought us the hot salsa--no charge.  Yum. The menu is small, but everything looked well thought out and tasty.  I was delighted to see two vegan entrees.  We got the negro modelo battered avocado taco.  Holy Moly, they were great.  Even the non-vegetarians would adore them.   They were on soft corn tortillas that were better than any I have ever had.

We finished we the coconut mango flan.  It was incredible.

The place is BYOB.  So stop around the corner at Dave's Super Market, and pick up a bottle of wine before you go to Orale.

They just opened, and I love it so far.  I just hope with time, they extend their menu, offer a vegetarian appetizer, and get a liquor license."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's better, the food or the people who work here. Ok its the food. I just had my first chili relleno outside of a Chichis...oh so that's what they're supposed to taste like! If you can survive the bartenders awful, corny jokes, you'll love this place.
PS killer coconut flan"}
{"text":"Great fresh food with wonderful service. Delicious chips and salsas to begin our meal too!"}
{"text":"Was in town from Boston for the NBA Finals and went into this place because it had the longest line...figured the locals knew a good place - food was reasonably price - very homemade and authentic - burrito was an 8 or 9 out of 10 and I know burritos - get them everywhere"}
{"text":"First let me say that I LOVE their salsas. I buy them at the market all the time. I finally convinced my husband to go to the restaurant for dinner. As I expected the salsas were yummy but I was surprised how expensive their entrees were. I got the pork tacos...3 tacos with pork and mango salsa...for $14.00. No beans, no rice, nothing extra. They were good but way over priced. I'll continue to buy the salsas at the market but we will not be going back to the restaurant anytime soon...its just not worth it for a family on a budget."}
{"text":"Food lacked flavor, way too over priced for the quality you are getting.  Would be better off going to Barrio or Lava lounge in the area"}
{"text":"YUMMY TACOS! Whenever I visit my family we always hit this spot up. The staff is always on top of it and the in house tortilla chips are a must!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you like bland this is the place for you. The chowder is runny and might be Cambell's soup. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Awesome, very attentive staff, amazing food! Vegan night is out of this world!"}
{"text":"They revamped the menu and added a new soup: corn and chipotle. Cream based (I'm a sucka for cream based soups) and it's delish. Highly recommended from the cleanest kitchen in NE Ohio. No soup was exchanged for this little review."}
{"text":"Had great experience here. Service was friendly and helpful. So many veg and non-veg choices I had a hard time deciding.  The tortilla soup was yummy. Corn, zucchini and black bean tacos were delicious. Hub had chowder and paella and enjoyed both. The basic lime margaritas were excellent. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This was the first visit here and I'm going to give it another chance. After reading all the amazing reviews for this place it must have been an off night for me. First off, I will say the staff is super friendly and attentive. My friend and I were in the mood for some Mexican and we hadn't tried here yet.
We sat down without reviewing the restaurant before hand and got the menus and were taken a bit aback. We have ate at all the Cleveland Mexican establishments. And we both thought well, if the price is this high it has to be amazing. Tonight was not the case. The salsa was definitely unique and it was good. However as soon as the $10 margaritas came out things started to go down hill. Maybe I'm used to cheaper establishments but if you charge $10 for a regular margarita you had better be able to taste the alcohol. Flavor was there albeit way too sweet. $10 worth ? No. Not when I can go to competitors and pay half that price and get double if not triple my money's worth. (They did take off one entire margarita off the bill and credited some so hey they tried to make it right).
The $14 chile relleno was the most expensive relleno  (single) I've ever bought. It had good seasoning but to me the sauce tastes like Campbell's tomato soup with some onions thrown in. Rice was under cooked and best part of the meal was the beans.
My friend got the chicken enchiladas. It had some bite and heat to it. But minus the crema and tomatillo sauce that smothered it, was bland. 
Other than the extremely nice staff, I don't get the pricing in combination with what was served. I will be back just because it had to be me having a off night. Although the empty dining room makes me wonder at 7pm on a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"Cool new Mexican restaurant on 25th. The service is very accommodating and attentive, the chips and salsa are enough to satisfy you, and it's BYOB which is a nice change of pace. We had the calamari and the Mahi Mahi Tacos which were great. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Way over priced for dinner!  I had 3 fish tacos and my bill came to almost $20, which comes to about $7 for a dinkly little taco! I don't mind paying a lot for phenomenal food, but that was not the case!  Just your average taco with some different ingredients at a not-so-average price!"}
{"text":"carne asada torta is great, as is most things to eat here."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The avocado tacos are unhealthy but very tasta. The salsa variety is great... We will be back the next time we visit Cleveland."}
{"text":"I was in town for a little vacation, staying at the Cleveland Hostel. I looked up restaurants near me on Yelp, and couldn't be more pleased with my choice. Orale! is awesome, with the friendliest staff ever. I came in by myself on a Friday night and sat near the salsa case at 5:50ish. The waiters were super attentive, knowledgeable, and helpful. They asked what salsa I was in the mood for, and I couldn't decide, so they brought out ALL of them, completely complementary. All is a huge selection (see my photo), and all were awesome! I also ordered the mahi mahi tacos, which were incredible. This is not your classic cantina, which I also happen to enjoy, but what Orale! does, they do well.  I will definitely be stopping again the next time I am in the Ohio City neighborhood. Thanks Orale! for making my trip to Cleveland rock with your incredible food awesomeness!!!"}
{"text":"Salsa was amazing that they give when you arrive!!! Absolutely loved the mango and the fish taco's! Sat outside on patio and enjoyed everything very much!!"}
{"text":"We walked in for lunch, and wondered why no one else was in there at noon on a Tuesday. The huevos rancheros was simply uncooked potatoes, cold pieces of cut sausage, and 2 eggs. The food also took a while for us being the only patrons.

Now the lack of people made sense, at least it wasn't expensive. We won't be back"}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was terrible. Was like eating cafeteria lunch, and we paid $70 for it. I only leave bad yelp reviews when it's really bad, and it was. So inauthentic + small portions for price. Wish we could get our money back."}
{"text":"Love this place! I got the Mahi Mahi Tacos. Soooooooo gooooood! Their salsas are out of this world!"}
{"text":"Definitely make the trip to this wonderful establishment! The food is phenomenal and the staff is courteous. Their tortilla chips are made in-house and different salsa's will leave you wondering where this place was hiding in the stars of the gods! Highly recommended!!!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place...the salsas are amazing! They are not the typical Mexican place with one boring salsa....Orale has several mild, medium, and hot salsas...some tomato based, others with fruit, some the avocado base...all amazing!

Second, the food is awesome. They don't have the typical menu items that the American \" Mexican \" places do....they have more traditional Mexican food that reminder me of our vacations to cancun. I love their tortilla soup...has some kick if you add the chorizo. They have a great stuffed pepper dish my bf orders every time we go. I love their lobster ceviche that is shaped like a lobster...cute and delicious! We've had almost everything on the menu and everything is good. 

The wait staff is friendly and attentive. They just expanded and added a bar so alcoholic drink will now be flowing. The art is always really cool. The wood table tops were made by the johnnyville slugger guy in the shop next door. Unique place."}
{"text":"Great food! Amazing presentation. Attentive staff. 

This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I came here with a friend for dinner yesterday. The place is small inside and there were only a a few people in the restaurant when we arrived. We were promptly greeted and encouraged to sit wherever we would like. We were brought waters and then a few moments later or waiter brought two kinds of salsa (one black bean the other mango) and chips for us. Both salsas were so tasty! Our waiter later asked if we would like to try another one of their salsas (which were complementary). We tried an avocado salsa, also very tasty! Ordering from the menu was difficult because everything looked very good. I order their corn chowder and the lobster empanadas! Both full of favor! My friend had the tortilla soup (vegetarian based) and the scallops, which she said were also good! This place is a nice find in Ohio City with good food and vibe! I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"While the west side market stand is awesome, the restaurant is even better.  This isn't your standard tex mex style place, rather, they serve some truly wonderful food.  It is evident that much thought goes into the menu.  The various salsas are an added plus.  This is a must try."}
{"text":"Maybe I expect a lot being a Manhattan transplant but at a minimum, I need a hint of flavor in any dish. 

The black bean soup was completely tasteless, the guacamole felt like it had been in the fridge at least two hours too long and the chicken tacos lacked any hint of seasoning. I don't think I have tasted chicken so bland. Ever!"}
{"text":"Just one of those places you go and everything is amazing. Definitely our top spot for when we want high quality Mexican cuisine. A few steps above the typical Mex restaurants which are fine... this is just really, really that much better in every way. Love this place."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent food - very delightful taste ! Their collection of salsa is something that ll draw me here anytime, in addition to the flavor in the chile relleno!

Saaransh"}
{"text":"So this place has been on W. 25th for 2 years and I just heard about it last week!  They just recently put a large sign and mini patio out front that draws more attention to the place.  It is very small inside but really cute.  It's BYOB which is amazing if you know about it.  Our waitress was so fun and knowledgeable about their food and history.  

Food was so good!  We got some salsas and guac to try and they are were great.  I got the mahi mahi tacos and my friend go the avocado tacos.  Both were delicious.  This isn't a typical wide range menu Mexican joint.  The prices of the entree's are a bit on the higher side ($14 for 3 tacos), but I think worth it.

Would definitely recommend trying it out, but remember it's BYOB!"}
{"text":"I've purchased several items (salsa, ceviche, crab cakes) they sell at the westside market. I loved them all so I decided to check out the restaurant. The service was great but the food was bland and overpriced."}
{"text":"I too really wanted to love this place, as ive been a huge fan of their stand at the West Side Market since moving to Cleveland, and I did LIKE it, but it would need some changes to be LOVED. I got the spiced chicken, and the BF got the Mahi Tacos. We also got the Beef Empenadas as an app.  You get tortilla chips and 2 of their salsas ( a green tomatillo, and a spicy red jalapeño one) complimentary. Of course we loved these, as we've had them to go from the market many times. The Empenadas were very flavorful and good, though I could have eaten several of them, and there are only 2 to an order.  My entree was good, large enough that I had it for lunch the next day. The BF's tacos were quite small for their price, and he said they were \"just ok\". 

So, the food was pretty good, but the menu is very small. Its not really high priced, though i did think it was overpriced for what it was. Would love to go again, but only if they expand their menu, as otherwise the only thing I would order would be what I already had."}
{"text":"fyi, Orale was pretty fantastic.  my wife melissa and i were literally the only 2 in there dining, so we had special attention from the very personable wait staff (our server's name was molly).  it's BYOB (which is awesome), so we brought a bottle of wine, and our server brought us 2 wine glasses from which to chug.  she also brought us house made tortilla chips and four (yes, four) homemade salsas --  a red tomato, a green tomatillo, a black bean, and a mango habanero ($0).  my only knock would be that they were all quite mild -- i like spice personally, but could see how they didn't want to scare anyone off.  mel especially liked the red and green because they were thick, but not chunky.  

for entrees,  mel had chipotle glazed lamb chops over \"momma's\" mashed potatoes ($14).  not sure what was in the potatoes, but i'm guessing butter and cheese -- they almost tasted like a pierogi filling (that's my sage polish culinary wisdom talking).  they were fantastic.  i had mahi mahi tacos, topped with some pickled carrot and jimaca and a jalapeno cream sauce (or \"liquid candy\", as our server put it) ($14).  very meaty, housemade corn tortillas filled to the brim.  awesome.  i was torn between those and the fried avocado tacos (vegan), which sounded amazing, but i guess i know what i'm getting when i go back. 

we didn't do dessert, but they also sounded delightful.  we will most certainly go back our next hankerin' for mexican.  i hope there are more patrons there next time, because Orale deserves it.  that's my review."}
{"text":"Not your typical mexican.  That is OK for me and my husband but there wasn't even a normal taco on the menu for the children.  Despite that, they found some things to eat and all of us were happy.  Our server was new which led to some interesting moments (ie, how to pour a serve a beer..... ??? she was sweet about it and we are patient).  I definitely enjoyed my food, it was not typical.... however, I'm not sure if we will go back again or not.  It wasn't super special and definitely is not my go -to place for Mexican in Cleveland.  I am still searching for that place!"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Orale's stand at the Market.  I cannot get enough of the habanero and papaya salsa and all of their enchiladas.  So we decided to try out their new restaurant location.  Yes, it's small.  I like the intimate, cozy feeling actually.  But black banquet chairs and faux wood grain tables?  Come on.  PIck something slightly more authentic and fun to match the wit of your brand's personality.  Onto the food...I opted for two appetizers...the chicken mole tamale and the empanadas with charred tomato sauce.  The tamale ingredients were *very* dry.  And judging by how much steam came out it when I cut into it, it was microwaved.  Disappointing.  As for the empanada, it was delicious.  The shredded beef was on point and I could have licked the charred tomato sauce off the plate.  My boyfriend had the gazpacho and said it was just okay but he loved the spring mix salad.  The menu is very small and they don't have a liquor license.  If I am in the mood for \"mod mex\" I'll go to Momocho every time.  I don't like Ohio City Burrito so this place falls somewhere in between.  I don't think I would search it out for a dining experience but I will continue to buy my salsas and enchiladas from their market stand."}
{"text":"Love it here!  The friendly staff bring you as much chips and delish salsa you desire as you wait for your food.  I love the smooth green salsa and the corn and bean salsa the most.  I have had about 10 meals there and I am always satisfied.  I really love the black been and chorizo quesadilla, the pork,  the basic salad, and the mahi mahi tacos.  I cannot remember what the names of things are that I love... but it is hard to go wrong.  Roberto has filled a void on W. 25th and I love it!  Great atmosphere as well... byob means you can walk down to the Gateway mart and buy a bottle of wine, save some $$ and tip your server well :)  One of my favorite lunch get-aways and I also love the Vegan Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Great little mex restaurant with marvelous salsas combined with a varied menu. Service was wonderful. Felt like we were home."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Tried 4 of their salsa and they were all amazing and fresh.  The food was awesome and our service was great too. Everything tasted so fresh.  I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"I love South of the Border fare, and also love fresh foods. 

This wonderful place has BOTH in great quantities! 

Orale is a smallish cafe, with a very nice, full service bar attached and its proprietors really know how to excite the taste buds. I had a wonderful meal of a multi-layer tortilla/chicken dish that was really tasty, along with two different types of very fresh salsas that were just amazing. The service was good and the bill was very reasonable. 

I think the only thing that was difficult was a lack of parking (street only,) but that should not dissuade you from checking this place out. Also, just for reference, Orale not only sells their wares at their establishment, but for a day or two a week, they sell BULK stuff over at the West Side Market! They have a variety of Tortillas, empanadas, enchiladas and tamales, along with their salsas for take-home enjoyment! 

So, next time you're passing by, stop in because you'll have a happy day at Orale!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today, and again, came away very impressed. This trip reinforced my love for their salsas, which were spot-on once again, and the steak tacos were incredible! 

Great service, great food, great price. I can't think of a reason to give them any less than 5 stars."}
{"text":"Holy salsa and guacamole! The tacos here are rocking!

My family and I came here a few weekends ago when we had an unexpected gathering due to a death.  While not the happiest of meetings, we made it fun and enjoyable with some Mexican food!  I'm always on the lookout for good Mex in the CLE and have been disappointed time and again.  Orale, I will visit you again!

This place is teeny-tiny so probably better for smaller groups as there are about 15 seats in the whole place.  Our waitress was great & she stayed on top of refilling glasses of water and ice tea without us asking. Thank you waitress!  I give you bonus points. (It is a BYOB joint so don't expect to order your marg. on the rocks here).  While she was a little chatty for my preferences, she was so sweet I didn't mind too much.

I have to say, the variety of salsa and quac is awesome.  Did I mention they just keep bringing them out to you without nickel and diming you for each and every one?  My mom ordered a Mex casserole -of-sorts.  While not what she was expecting, or to my taste, she enjoyed it and thought the flavors were great.  The tacos were rocking.  My sister, brother-in-law, and I all ordered three different kinds and then switched with each other so we could try all three.  I have to say I really dug the way the tacos were served and how fresh and yummy they were.  My favorite was the vegan taco!  If you need veg / vegan options, this is a place for you!

Check it out and go to the West Side Market to check out their stand in there where you can purchase their salsas and guacamoles in bulk!"}
{"text":"I'm seriously confused here.  Like, did I go to the same place as all these reviewers?  Did I go on a terribly off night?  The food was just ...not good. And expensive. And the portions were small.  Hm.

We went on a Thursday night. And there was, literally, no one else in the restaurant. That should have been a clue, but all these Yelp reviewers said such great things!  So we proceeded.  I will say that the service was good, but, because we were the only customers, I would expect that.  They give complimentary chips, which was great.  Love that.  However, the consistency of the chips was off...my boyfriend thought they were stale, but I think they're just like that (?).  They brought out a variety of salsas (I think we tried, like, 5 different kinds) but none of them were good.  Most were totally bland, but one was inedibly spicy, and another just tasted really terrible.  

The highlight of our meal was the appetizer: the chicken taquitos.  They were tasty and so was the guacamole they came with, however, they were $8 for four small taquitos. That's like a dollar a bite! 

Our entree, the carne asada tacos, was the most underwhelming thing I've eaten in a long time. First of all, it huuuurts to think that I paid $16 for THREE, regular sized tacos.  Granted, they were steak tacos, but they had me wishing I had gone to Chipotle -- bland, tasteless, and sorta lukewarm.  They were unsatisfying, but, at the same time, filling. They sat in the pit of my stomach, like a pile of bricks until the next morning.

This experience really made me question using Yelp so religiously to find new restaurants."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in my meal. Let me start by saying that I visit the Westside Market stand regularly, and have always enjoyed the food. I decided to try out the sit down location, and was shocked at how lifeless the food was. 

I ordered the carne asada tacos. While the portions were generous the flavor was sadly lacking. It was almost as if nothing was tasted in the kitchen before plating. A little salt and spices would have been nice seeing as this was Mexican food. 

I hope this was an anomaly, and not a sign of what's to come."}
{"text":"Shocked at how cool this place was and I hadn't heard of it.  The food was really good, I got 15% off for checking in with yelp.  I asked for my food a bit on the spicier side and they guy in back hooked it up.  I was pretty descriptive about how hot I wanted it, something like, I want it to be spicy, but not make my face bleed...  He knocked that one out of the park.  The food tasted fresh, the salsas were colorful and delicious.  Everything was exactly how I wanted it to be.  Pretty chill atmosphere, very friendly and helpful staff.  This is truly a 5 star place.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Yuk!  I'm a fan of authentic Mexican and this place does not fit the bill. The menu looked good and I'm all for trying the little hole In the wall with quirky decor but it was a big disappointment.  We tried several of their salsas - all were painfully bland. I got a salad that was so generic I felt like I was eating from one of those grab and go freezers at a gas station. My husband's food looked a little better but he said the meat was over cooked and rubbery - ew!  Margaritas - not good either. I'm sad because we really could use a good little Mexican place in our neighborhood. To add insult to injury - the bill was comparable to what we would have paid at one of those upscale bar/restaurants across the street. . . . . Live and learn."}
{"text":"The Barbacoa pork tacos with mango salsa are AMAZING! Fresh and crunchy taco shells they don't fall apart when you bite into them. My husband had chicken tacos and said they were a bit bland but I tasted them and they were perfect for me. Price wise it's a little higher than I would like to pay for a taco but it's also the atmosphere and Ohio city life. It's small inside, their guacamole is good, just wish it was spicier. All in all it was good for a quick date night without the kids."}
{"text":"The food was really good. We got the barbacoa pork quesadilla and the chorizo quesadilla. They were very good and presentation was fantastic. I could have used more goat cheese though. The chips with the three salsas were great, the pico was my favorite of the salsas. 

We were the only people in the whole place for lunch on a Wednesday about 1230. So the service was pretty good. But it did take a little long to get our food.

I plan on going back again and I bet I will be giving five stars then. And I plan to take advantage of their BYOB then."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, and I want to like it here more than I did. Everything seemed overpriced for casual Mexican food. The salsa was fresh and yummy and my tacos were good, but just not great."}
{"text":"This place missed. Our server said she didn't know how to make our drinks. But also the kitchen didn't know how to make our food. Shit drinks, weird fishy empanadas, gross saucy chicken tostadas. Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"Had great experiences with Orale. Been here a number of times for dinner and for lunch. Their array of salsas is fantastic and the waitstaff is always super attentive and helpful.

Gluten-free and wheat-free options, but they are always quick to ask if you can handle \"trace amounts\" of gluten. I've never had a bad reaction, but I suppose it's just them being extra careful. If you're super sensitive, you may want to ask them for more guidance and information. 

Chicken tortilla soup --fantastic for a cold, windy winter day. The flan was fantastic. Portions are generous. Good vegetarian/vegan options."}
{"text":"The food is god awful. Now I know that mexican food in Ohio is nothing to get excited about. But admittedly, we had higher expectations because of the location and the Yelp reviews. Personally, I have no idea how anyone can stand the food here, but that might be because I've been cursed with working taste buds. If forced to go here, avoid the fish tacos. Bad enough that I didn't finish my meal.....you know that means something! Good location though and decent place to hang out w/ friends for drinks."}
{"text":"I've been going here since they opened and thoroughly love it.  The staff is super nice and the food kills!  I love that you get to try all of the unique salsas...there are many and they are delicious!  The tortas modified with house pickled habanero peppers rock my face into a burning, heavenly mess."}
{"text":"this is the mexican joint that the westside has been missing for so long. luchitas is great, but this place has its own flavor. it can be a little pricey, so don't expect standard taco bell prices a lot of places offer. But its well worth it."}
{"text":"Oh Orale...How I love your dinner menu and wish your lunch menu was just as sumptuous. I went in so pumped to share this restaurant with my hubby, but made the mistake of arriving before 4pm, during lunch hours. The menus are completely different. I'll be back, but it will be after 16:00 my friend. I would have given this a strong 4 stars before my lunch experience, and am afraid I have to drop it down to a 3 now :(

Key takeaways:

Salsas - An abundance of options with something for every palate and they're all very inventive and flavorful. Something to satiate the taste buds of even the spiciest of spice lovers. They've brought over 4 or 5 options to us before, so don't be shy about asking for something different if you're in the mood to try something new.

BYOB - How can you miss with this option? Two options for beer within walking distance are Dave's Market and Great Lakes Brewing Company. They'll keep your beverages cool in the fridge for ya and bottle openers are provided

Menu - FYI - small menu selection, so if you're a picky eater, you may want to check it out in advance. This is not your typical Mexican restaurant and as the name says, a contemporary take on traditional favorites. Beyond that, I must break this section down further as follows:

Dinner Options: Amazing! Battered and deep fried avocado tacos - yes           please! Sooooooo yummy. They also have an all vegan menu available on Tuesdays which looks promising

Lunch Options: Less than stellar. The goat cheese quesadilla and mushroom enchiladas sounded so promising, but were both disappointing. The goat cheese was hiding somewhere, and that somewhere was not in our quesadilla. The corn tortillas were the only things you could taste in the enchiladas as there were no other prominent flavors and the filling was a bit sparse. 

Ambiance -  Very cool vibe with local paintings on the wall and a prime location in Ohio City. I always try to grab the window seat to look out on W 25th and get some free entertainment with our meal.

Service - Excellent service! Staff is knowledgeable about the menu and have always provided great recommendations."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of Orale from their stand in the WSM so I was uber excited when I heard they were going to get a restaurant in the area. I live in OC so I decided to do a drive-by takeout order one day on my way home from work. I ordered the lobster gazpacho - which was very tasty and had a decent amount of lobster. I got the Mahi tacos for an entree. I wasn't bowled over by these. However, since I got this as takeout when I got home and opened the container it was a taco massacre in there so maybe something got lost in transit - literally.  It definitely is not the meal to get if you have a serious appetite. Lastly I finished with the dessert tamale which was the highlight of the meal!  Staff was polite and friendly; I recognized a few faces from their WSM stall. I will caution this is not the typical \"cheap\" Mexican. I spent close to $30 for that meal but it is good and something different than just tacos or some of the mod mex places in town. I fully intend to go back. Next time I will dine in so I can take advantage of their BYOB policy."}
{"text":"Mexican with a flair, had lunch there recently, was surprised by the menu. The dishes represented a flair not found in most Mexican restaurants. The. Choices where limited but extremely satisfying. The Ceasar  with cilantro chicken is exceptional and substantial. The steak entree was also beyond compare"}

{"text":"Perhaps it was my mistake for assuming that this was a more authentic approach at Mexican dining! While their waiters and waitresses were truly lovely, the food was extremely underwhelming and their \"Vegan Tuesday\" selection was downright inedible--my dish tasted embarrassingly like reheated \"Amy's\" pre-frozen dinners! I don't think I will return here to dine, although I could enjoy a drink or two! West 25th has so many excellent selections for dining that this seems almost like an eye & stomachache at the end of the street! I would only advise you come here if you're open to a truly new experience or a completely free-handed take on Mexican fare!"}
{"text":"So good!  I had no idea that the wonderful little West Market Stand now also has a full fledged restaurant.  It is no longer BYOB as mentioned in other reviews and cute as heck.  Having been to Mexico many times, it felt authentic...more cafe like and relaxed.  The vanilla ginger infused tequila was delicious and so was the food.  Don't expect punch you in the face spice or heat.  This food has a more subtle feel to it. The flavors meld together beautifully and unfold slowly.  Don't pass this up on your next visit to West 25th street."}
{"text":"I loved this place. We went for lunch and were pleasantly surprised at the freshness, quality, and price of our meals. 

The salsas are to die for. Everything is fresh and gourmet. They have a wonderful avocado salsa and a delicious mango salsa all made in house. Best of yet, they are all complimentary! The waiter was so attentive and kept bringing over different salsas to try."}
{"text":"Ate there w my dad around 4:30pm today. Chorizo empanadas (4 for $8) were bland. Mahi tacos had a horrible tasting sauce on them, but the mahi was cooked nicely. Caesar salad had no flavor. My dad liked the Gazpacho, but the shrimp tamale was underwhelming. The bartender gave us 2 salsas (we didn't get to choose), the green 1 was horrible, but pineapple was OK. I ended up having to head to Johnny Mangos for $1 tacos. I wanted to love Orale, but ended up hating it."}
{"text":"Ok, we must have stopped on an off night because salsas were very bland. Gfs mahi tacos tasted like canned tuna, my long shank pork chop was boring, onions n mushrooms were sweet, just a mess on a plate that screamed anti Mexico. The staff was nice but as far as Mexican cuisine, this place misses the mark."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I lived in San Diego and LA for several years so I really miss good Mexican food. Orale cured that hunger and is really good. I had the black bean and goat cheese quesadilla with chorizo sausage. Yummy! I'll definitely be back to try other dishes. I hope they are just as good."}
{"text":"Ummm, did you say avocado salsa? Oh, yes, you did--and it was delicious. 

The man and I were hungry and looking for some take-out in the OHC. He randomly mentioned that although we've bought a ton from their stand at the WSM, we've never eaten at Orale's new restaurant. I can't even tell you what took us so long to come here, considering we know we love their food. 

Anyways, yes--the inside is tiny and could seat maybe 15-20 people, tops. But, the taste of the food is huuuuge. I mean, ordering mexican take-out is always a gamble. Things can get pretty soggy on the journey home. Not my steak tacos! Ohmygod... tender flank steak, chopped tomatoes, cheese and avocado salsa wrapped in corn tortillas. It's like heaven in taco form. I can't even imagine what their beer battered avocado tacos must taste like. The man got the vegetarian sandwich and I didn't hear a peep out of him while he was mowing this thing down. We also both got cups of the tortilla soup with chicken, which was smoky and delicious. I loved that it wasn't cream-based, but spicy and tomato based. Definitely more authentic. 

One thing I will say is that although their handmade chips are delicious and fresh, I wish they seasoned them with salt. But then again, I love salt and we didn't have salsa with our to-go meals to pair them with. 

The best part was when I checked in on my mobile Yelp app, which magically supplied me with a \"10% off our entire check\" offer! I asked the server who asked the owner and she said she had just put that check-in offer up that day! So cool that they're offering up deals to yelpers.

The food is fresh, delicious and authentic. I can't wait to return to try more of the menu and enjoy our meal at Orale instead of grabbing take-out!"}
{"text":"Excellent salsas. Food was flavorful and fresh. Good service. We stopped by after one afternoon after visiting the west side market at sat on the patio on the front on West 25th. The atmosphere was interested with good people-watching but there were some aggressive crazy/homeless people lurking in the immediate vicinity of the patio. The price was a little high for what it is but overall a good experience. I would come back if I was in the area and looking for mexican done right."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Loved all the salsas. Mahi mahi tacos and beer battered avocado tacos were delicious. What a great little local find."}
{"text":"You might not be able to pronounce the names of the dishes, but you'll enjoy the taste..."}
{"text":"Amazing jalapeño guacamole. Recommended the chicken tacos. Make reservations though, only seats about 15. Also it's BYOB."}
{"text":"Salsas were excellent and they had many varieties (10plus). We got the lobster tortilla soup, chille relleno, mahi taco, lobster ceviche. Everything was very tasty and looked yummy as well."}
{"text":"Where to start? I just want to say it is nice to find a Mexican restaurant that does not specialize in ground beef!

 I guess the salsas!  There were several types of salsas. The standard was very fresh and tasty.  The habanero salsa had a nice kick and is appropriately spiced.  The mango and pineapple salsas were pretty tasty if you like sweet salsas.  The corn chips were served fresh.  

We started out with the salad and the fried Queso fresco. It was pretty tasty. The cheese was a hit.  I got the Shrimp with chorizo.  It was tasty but for 10$ it was really not a great value as the shrimp were not really jumbo in my opinion. I think the next time I will try the tortilla soup.  I also saw someone order blue corn meal encrusted calamari. I hope that is still on the menu as I would love to try it.

Oh did I mention this place was BYOB. I picked up a 6pack of Red Stripe. It is a mild beer that drinks easy and goes well with a heavy Mexican meal. Better than Corona!

Next entrees. I ordered the roasted pork tenderloin cooked medium with shitake shrooms, grilled onions with a deep fried blue potato cake stuffed with goat cheese. The pork was cooked perfectly.  I really enjoyed the dish! My fiery red headed Slovak ordered the Lamb Chops cooked medium.  Very tasty. I really like lamb. Screw Mary I really really like lamb.  It was cooked perfectly and cheesy mashed potatoes were amazing.

The service was very friendly and always had the bottle opener ready for the beer. The manager was very knowledgeable about the menu and made some great suggestions. She even help me play a joke on El Cheapo. I had a friend come up and meet us for desert. It turns out he was allergic to avocado so he could not partake.  He did eat the chips and salsa.  Before he started to eat the chips I advised they are 3 dollars per person if you do not order an entree.  I asked the  manager to write him a fake bill for 3 dollars.  He about shit his pants.  This is a guy who thinks his non alcoholic drinks should be free.  He likes to claim he is a designated driver.  Designated driver my ass. The desert was the only lackluster part of the meal. It was a berry and avocado whipped cream desert.  I will pass on it next time.

I'm looking forward to returning and trying some other options. I know I will not be disappointed. Great addition to OC.

Un buen hambre no hay pan duro!"}
{"text":"I have never been so happy to give a place five stars. Sunday evening w the Mrs. In Ohio City, we wanted to Try something new. We both like Mexican and innovative cuzine. These guys open up with TWO complementary salsas, one classic tomato and one mango pineapple- Both Amazing. And if you chat up the waitress/owner? She might bring out an even more amazing avocado  tomatillo  concoction.

I got the Scallop appetizer... A+, standard fancy restaurant price for 4 but just as good as a \"fine dining\" pan seared scallops. 

Wife got the hibiscus and the goat cheese salad which was equally impressive with blackberries and all that jazz. The drink special I got was good but kinda small (but that's the way it goes at most places) AND to top it off she let us use our Yelp coupon last minute for 15% off. Great meal, great service good prices."}
{"text":"I walked into Orale Kitchen, excited to try a new establishment that I read loads about on Yelp.  The atmosphere was quaint and very hipster.  We sat at a small table near the glass case of salsa's, maybe the best choice I made all night.  I was amazed that we got salsas that were not your typical tomato and onion mixture.  I tried all of the fruit salsa's including a pineapple onion tomato, a mango and papaya (two of my favorite fruit) and was NOT disappointed.  That's kind of where our night headed a bit south.  We waited for quite a bit for our main dishes to come out.  I had read so much about the mahi mahi and was recommended by the waitress to try it.  How could this not be good?  My boyfriend ordered the steak and we were expecting to have a GREAT MEAL. 
 
I was really disappointed by the lack of taste of the fish and how over cooked the steak was.  For the price, I was expecting FLAVOR  There was a big party that came right after us, so we think that the cook might have forgotten about our meal just a little bit.  The waiter was great though, kept refilling our waters and our salsa bowls.  Maybe next time I'll try something different but the food was just sub par for me. I really loved the salsa and staff, but this spot just didn't hit the spot for me.  HOpefully I'll change my mind another time.  Some of the best salsa, not the best dinner food :("}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times. Each time I loved it.  I even took my mom there.  

WHAT THIS PLACE IS NOT: This is not Cozumel. This is not a place that features options 1 through 132, with each option being some unique combination of 6 frozen ingredients. This is not a place you can expect to be served 3 minutes after you order, because that's how long it takes to microwave it. This is not one of those places where you have to leave your jacket in the car because if you don't, it will smell like your fajita dinner for a few days.

Let's start off with an analogy. Orale's salsas are as adventurous and delicious as the guacamole at Momocho, but unlike Momocho, it's free at the start of your meal.  And these are the salsas that they feature at their stand at the West-side Market (the ones that often sell out). If you're looking for some unconventional salsa (perhaps salsa spicy enough to haze someone with), Roberto (the chef/owner in the back) will whip one up for you.  Tips: Try the mango-habanero, the tomatillo, or the pinapple/mint/coconut salsa.  iOlé!

But be sure to save some room - your supper hasn't even arrived yet. For dinner, I would recommend the beer battered avocado tacos or the mexi-ravioli.  Portions are smaller, but don't feel like your getting ripped off... you just scarfed some seriously delicious chips and salsa. And you can always get more. 

For a limited time, it's BYOB, although they've been approved for a limited beer and wine license which they should have sometime mid-2012. 

The restaurant is small but I've never had to wait. Even on a Saturday night.  Hurry and get there before this place becomes the hopping spot it's destined to be.

iViva Orale!"}
{"text":"four of us went, and four of us left disappointed. fish tacos were dry and bad. not many good Mexican options around, but places like momocho blow this out of the water"}
{"text":"So today I decided I would \"order out\" due to scheduling and my desire to eat here.  My phone order was placed and paid for easily enough.  I ordered the Southwestern Ravioli & my partner ordered the Torta.  The southwestern sauce for the ravioli was AMAZING however I was disappointed with the quantity of the food served for an early evening order.  Taste was spot on despite the price.  I was lucky enough to sample the torta.  It looks like a sandwich, i was expecting to see something pizza like...with that being said however it was good as well.  The food is good, the price was a little much for the small portions served.  Ill be back to try out more."}
{"text":"I would do 3.5 stars if that were an option. I had smoked chicken on a tostada which was really tasty but wasn't what I expected. The fish tacos were also pretty tasty. Service was pretty quick and friendly. I went to eat here for dinner and I was expecting larger dinner plates but they were on the smaller side. I think this place is better for lunch if anything. 

Also fyi before you expect to order a cerveza there, it's BYOB. I guess they dont' have an alcohol license. 

All in all, I'd go back again if I was in the area and looking for some lunch."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch with some friends on Cinco de Mayo.  It was pretty empty for a Saturday but all the food was really tasty and they had great service.

Right when I got in, the waitress was super friendly and telling me how excited she was that they started service iced tea.  She then offered me an array of salsas they had available.  I didn't know what my friends would like so she said she'd just bring me a mild, medium, and spicy.  They were AWESOME.  I really liked the spicy, but beware it has a nice kick to it.  She then brought out a chipotle salsa they just made that was my favorite, it was smoky and slightly sweet with a little bit of kick.  Oh, did I mention these were all complimentary?  So yummy.

I think they just opened so they were BYOB and were nice enough to refrigerate our beers and give us limes or anything we needed.  We tried the shrimp and avocado salad, which came with a really awesome sauce.  I would get it again.  I got the Torta Milanesa de Pollo.  It wasn't quite what I expected (a little bit on the sweeter side) but it was still good.  The chicken was breaded perfectly and the beans and aioli were perfectly matched to it.  My friends tried the Pollo Ahumado and Tortilla Enchiladas and both really loved them.  

Great service, good food.  I'll definitely be back again for dinner because their dinner menu looked awesome."}
{"text":"Yum! They creative sauces and house made chips here are awesome, the tacos were inventive and delish, and the service was phenomenal. The owner came out to explain all the dips, and when we couldn't decide she happily brought them all out to us! Everyone was courteous, and they even did a good job of serving us the wine and beers that we brought (BYOB!). 

Sadly for me, I think they are expanding and getting their own liquor license, but I'll surely be back!"}
{"text":"Vegan Tuesday is amazing!! 
Beer battered avocado tacos, customized salsa, blue corn soyrizo empanadas... It's ridiculously good! I'm going to gain so much weight.  
 (... and Maggies vegan bakery is right next door)

BYOB"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good salsa and chips. They have like 12 different varieties of salsas. Pretty impressive!

I believe our waitress was also the owner, but she never exactly stated it. She was top notch and educated us on the lunch and dinner menu.

Our entrees were not well seasoned. The flavors were bland and didn't meet the promise of the menu description. All of the protein was over cooked.

I was disappointed. I really wanted to leave a flowery review due to the great chips and salsa, excellent service, and cleanliness of the restaurant. Too bad the entrees were not up to the same standard."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The staff was very friendly and the food was not your typical Mexican fare. The food is very authentic. I wanted some guacamole and asked if they had some on the menu and was told that they didn't . A few minutes later the Chef personally made and brought us out some guacamole , who does that? I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. And the guacamole was awesome !!!"}
{"text":"Great pork chop. I was a bit disappointed that they are dry and we had to go down the street to get a beer. Heard they should have something soon so I'll have to try stop back."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and i had a few tamales to go, the flavor was lacking, as well as the texture.  It felt like eating marzipan, and there was very little tiny pieces of protein.  For almost 3 dollars a piece, its not worth it.  I may go back to try other items."}
{"text":"I'm upping the stars for Orale! since they now have a vegan night every Tuesday, where there's an entire vegan menu in addition to the regular menu."}
{"text":"I went here with my parents one night for dinner.  Things that rule about this place:
1.  The servers are awesome, always refilling drinks, chips, and salsas.
2.  The salsa selection isn't the typical boring from a jar stuff that most places serve.  It's made fresh and they give you a choice.  We had this stuff that was green like pea soup but was flavor explosion.  It was perfectly spiced, not too hot and not too mild.  We ended up taking a container home (only FIVE BUCKS!) and it was devoured within a day.
3.  They actually have stuff labeled VEGAN on their menu.  I had this ravioli stuff that had soy chorizo in it.  It was pretty delicious.  My parents each had tacos with different meat and they both enjoyed their meals.
It is a bit pricey but the quality of the food makes up for it.  I will definitely be a repeat customer here."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but very very good food. The owners are awesome and will give you a variety of salsas to try if you ask (the garlic habanero is incredible). The mahi tacos are delicious, but the best thing is the lamb chop. Trust me. Get the lamb chop. Seriously. Oh also the empanadas are crazy good. You'll spend more than you should for Mexican food, but weirdly you won't even be a little bit sad about it."}
{"text":"This place was horrible! My meal was Undercooked! I got the pork-chops meal. The side was good and the mushrooms were good but the meat itself was under cooked! I hated my meal! Stay away from the pork!

The only good thing I can say about this place is its in a great location and the free chips and salsa were good because the salsa they bring out is different, not your typical salsa. I will say my fiancé enjoyed his soup and scallops."}
{"text":"I've long been a fan of Orale (sorry, I refuse to add the gratuitous exclamation mark) thanks to their excellent WSM stand, so I knew I'd be trying the restaurant eventually. A late Saturday dinner with my husband proved to be well worth the trip. The small space and small menu belie the outsized flavors and creativity coming out of the kitchen. Things started really well with Orale's excellent chips and two delicious salsas arriving shortly after we sat down. We came prepared with four beers, as it's BYOB. My calamari starter was a great concept, but the lone misstep of the evening; its tasty breading was not quite crispy enough and the meat was a bit overdone. I stared longingly at my husband's lobster gazpacho until he relented and shared. It was awesome. Perfectly spiced and topped with a mound of tender cool lobster. My husband got the summer roll appetizer to round out his all-cool meal, and the half I ate was delicious - mango and shrimp wrapped in a jicama. My oddly healthy-eating husband could not dissuade me from the star of the show, however: The tempura battered avocado tacos. Holy hell, behold the glory of deep-fried fatty avocado. Three massive mounds of taco glory, these are topped with a wonderful pickled carrot. I did not miss the meat, and I usually only say that about Indian food. Throughout it all, we had some of the best service ever, at any pricepoint. We wished we could clone our prompt, friendly, and thoughtful server and put her in all our favorite restaurants. Luckily, the food at Orale is worth returning for all on its own."}
{"text":"Orale! - is one of those places  you go when you miss your Spring Break in Cancun hangover tacos with salsa and chips. They are the perfect remedy to a bad day and fill you up. Get this- not only are the tacos and salsa worth the first time visit here but so are the enchiladas and tamales. 

The cherry on top for me was how attentive the servers were- but not annoying. They refilled our salsa containers right away upon request and always made sure we had chips on the table.

Bring a few friends and grub up on some great south of the boarder comida!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try, Guacamole was amazing, and the salsas as well. Not too expensive, but a small lunch menu.
The waiter was amazing, mentioned he was new to the restaurant and did a great job answering our questions. People in our group decided to try out the Enchiladas, they came out pretty dry(we eat Mexican food often) he was very nice and told us he would take them off the menu and was ok with those guests ordering something else. Now the issue is, he went back to the chef to place the new order, and this restaurant is small, we heard the chef go off on the waiter. it was very appalling and rude. We as customers do not want to hear it, the waiter was very apologetic, and the other sweet girl came to our table and apologized for the inconvenience. As customers, and also an employee at another restaurant, it is not good to hear a chef have a full out freak out on a waiter, it is  not his fault.  I do not know if this is a place we would come back to, we did not to hear what we heard. Good luck to the waiters at this restuatant, YOU ARE GREAT!"}
{"text":"Looking for a little more spice in the salsa but overall the restaurant is a great place for Mexican with a twist. mahi mahi tacos were wonderful."}
{"text":"I'm on a mission to find and try all the BYOB places in CLE and can't believe it's taken me so long to try Orale!  Amazing service! Amazing salsa! Can't wait to go back. Annnnd yelpers get 15% off when you check in, which is awesome."}
{"text":"Loved the food! The waitress was wonderful and recommended a few of there many salsas. The ones we tried were great! I will definitely be going back to try the rest. Oh and the mahi mahi fish tacos were delicious!"}
{"text":"Exceptional salsas, friendly service, lovely tacos, nice vibe.  Except for it being in Cleveland (doh!) I'd be happy to return."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times with friends. I would describe this place as hipster Mexican. Food wise- I've tried the spicy guacamole, tortilla soup, chile relleno, and chicken tacos. All were delicious. I think my favorite part of the meal was trying all the various types of salsas they have. The waitress we had brought over a bowl of each of the types and kept them coming during the entire meal! They were all delicious and so different. The food tasted fresh and the atmosphere was very casual. The restaurant is small, which in my opinion, makes the experience that much more cozy. Great place to go with friends for a casual dinner before or after hanging out on W 25th!"}
{"text":"excellent food and excellent service.

my friends and I went there for an impromptu dinner and I'm glad that we tried this place out. it has lots of art works on the walls that are for sale. my friend actually bought one painting from them and they will be able to give the money to the local artist.

food wise, I have to say their salsa options were amazing. they were obviously made from scratch and very fresh and yummy. we had empanadas, smoked chicken taquitos and lobster and papaya cechice to start. I would recommend the empanadas. taquitos was a little boring - its basically wrapped chicken meat with fried crust outside. it was not bad just not that special. the lobster dish was pretty good! the presentation especially was very funny haha. see my pictures below. it was very sweet and very fresh but if you keep eating it for a while, the sweetness will probably tire you out. after having this dish, I went back to the salsa they gave us in the beginning and it totally bland the flavor of the salsa out. what a bummer. for entree I had the mahi mahi tacos it was pretty good! the fish was not fried but I think it was soft yet creaming and just hit the spot. my friend ordered the lamb chop. for only 16 bucks it was a good deal. however I think they undercooked it a little but it was very flavorful. 

if you are a yelper like me, don't forget to check in at the restaurant - your first check in will give you 15% off the entire bill!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Orale making a run to the Westside Market and stopped in for a dinner the veryt next day.  
Service was top notch.  Food was amazing.  The chips were fresh and plentiful. the guacomole was fresh and tasty.  The salas (we tried three) were great.  The chicken tortila soup was excellent.  The beef tacos were incredible.  No ground meat here just marinated steak in a tacos shell.  Desserts are made in house and are amazing.  Give it a try, you enjoy the night out.  Friendly personal service, killer Mexican with flare and the best sweet finishing touches you can ever hope for.  And very affordable.  Love it can't wait to return again."}
{"text":"\"NOM\" was the first thing out of my mouth when I had their scrumptious mango salsa and then I had their goat cheese quesadilla and I was in love. We went here for lunch before heading out to West Side Market and I am so glad we did. The place was small and quaint, they had a nice low key vibe inside and a really simple menu. If you're looking for a low cost with great quality Mexican food then stop by this place. I don't think you'll be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food was good. We had chips and salsa to start - pico de gallo and this mango/papaya salsa that was like \"sunshine in my mouth\" per my friend. And it was! 

Guacamole was also delicious, loved that they didn't include tomatoes in it and kept it simple. I ordered the chile relleno dish, which came with yummy refried black beans and rice - very filling. Everything was super fresh. 

Other positives...they have one of my favorite tequilas - Espolon Blanco and the waitress was really nice, service was quick.

Minor glitch...Bartender made us lime margarita instead of our requested blood orange and had some issues trying to make a pitcher. If I come back, I think I'll stay on menu and stick to a single glass :  ) 

Overall, I liked this place. The menu was fairly limited, but I liked what I had, so I recommend!"}
{"text":"Anytime I go to the West Side Market, I go to the Orale stand. The chef just opened up this restaurant on 25th. I had a splitting headache this morning and decided to stop in after getting some stuff at the market. The inside is cool. The service was excellent and really attentive to my needs because I was hungover. The server was a very nurturing person. The chips and salsa were great. They also sell them in take out containers. I did not have a huge appetite so I ate a chicken mole tamale and a beef empanada. My brother told me about the place and he tried the vegan avocado tacos which he said were delicious. I am glad that they opened up and plan on coming here a lot. It was a memorable experience. The window seat is good for Saturday afternoons to watch the people that pass. I saw a bum walking by holding a beer. There was a plastic bag that somebody threw on the ground. He picked it up and placed it in the garbage can. I thought that was a really nice thing to do. If only all people started giving a damn."}
{"text":"Holy wow. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. 

Ambiance was right on for a date night or cozy night out with a group of friends - very warm. 

They serve you three salsas right off the bat: a green w/ avocado & cilantro, a mango habanero, and a spicy tomato (saucy, not chunks). All three were great. And free.

Got the lavender-lime Margarita: very sweet but awesome. Did give me some heartburn and a bit of a stomach ache from the the sweetness, but the flavor was SO good. The boyfriend got blood orange. Too sweet. Also delicious anyway.

Got the negra modelo battered avocado tacos. One of the best things I've ever eaten. I don't say that often. I mean, sure, you'd assume battered avocados are amazing. But where else have you had them? And boyfriend's chile relleno was huge and also great (not as great as mine of course). 

We also got the Mexican salsa & coconut pineapple salsa. Neither were as good as their three standard ones. They were good though. And free. 

Our server was PERFECT. Attentive without being annoying, perfect timing, knowledgeable, nice (not phoney). 

We had a perfect night at Orale and if I'm being honest with myself: I'm pretty picky and ALWAYS find something wrong. I didn't with this place."}
{"text":"Ok, Orale!  You got me!  If you can use an exclamation point in your name, I can use it in my review!  

First off:  Salsas!  
Holy crap.  So good.  We got two to start us out and they were as different as can be and completely different from normal salsas you'll get at an average Mexican restaurant.  Then they brought out the pineapple salsa...Mmm!  

Second off: Small plates! 
We ordered the Empenadas and the entree of Pork Chop.  Both were great, although the Empenadas could have use a little of some sort of sauce because the mixture of goat cheese was almost drying to the already dry-ish empenada.  Nothing against Orale, that's just how empenadas are.  

Third off: Beer! 
It's BYOB.  I love this!  Especially since there is a convenience store next door where you can buy a huge bottle of Corona for next to nothing.  It really helps even out the price and make the evening's experience less expensive than any other nice restaurant.

Overall: Success! 
We loved our food, we loved our Corona, we loved our salsas.  I would love to have a party there, bring in some Margaritas and just buy lots of small plates.  It's a wonderful authentic tasting contemporary Mexican cuisine destination."}
