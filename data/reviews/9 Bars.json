{"text":"Love, love, love this place!    THE BEST COFFEE & FRIENDLIEST SERVICE IN TORONTO. The owner, Laith, seriously goes out of his way to make sure that every coffee is just right. Cappuccinos, lattes, cortados, mochas, espresso, drip - this place makes freaken amazing coffee! The london fog, fruit smoothies and herbal teas are really tasty too.   The Chicken schnitzel is my favourite sandwich - the chicken breast is out of this world delicious, (although the mozarella and beef are delicious, too) and the chocolate-almond croissant is to die for.  Not only are the food and drink delicious, but the atmosphere is great: good music, nice people, and genuinely friendly service. Laith has created a community, or rather brought us together, addicted to his brew :)  Can't say enough great things about this place!  There are 3 outlets for those who work on their laptops."}
{"text":"Great soy latte.  The sad part is that they only have one cup size when ordering to go. I wanted large latte but only a medium size is available."}
{"text":"Fantastic espresso, fresh baked croissants and some really authentic and rustic sandwiches.  Atmosphere is great for a meet or catching up on a bit of work!"}
{"text":"Best latte and espresso in the city. This is the real thing - quality is excellent.  Owners are great and friendly.   The ambiance is superb.    Has a patio as well."}
{"text":"Really great espresso and delicious food. This place is a wonderful addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"9 Bars is a little cafe tucked away on the east end of St. Clair. It's in the perfect location for me and the entire atmosphere of the place is far superior to some of the other cafe's I've been too.   Apart from the convenient location, which is really more of a personal perk for me, the food and coffee are out of this world. The last time I went, I ordered a Vanilla Latte and a Chicken Schnitzel sammie to go and it was very, very tasty. The chicken breast was tender and juicy and the spicier aoili worked wonderfully well in the sandwich. I am always looking for a coffee shop that also sells superior sandwiches too rather than the usual sweet baked variety and this one hits the spot.    Overall this place is inviting, and the owner is lovely and the place is just the perfect spot to go and read. It will be my go to local fave."}
{"text":"One of the really nice independent coffee shops in town , however , the munchies and espresso drinks compared to their size is a bit overpriced. The owners are warm and friendly and usually play cool deep house music. Tryout the Cortado, flat-white, Cappuccino etc . They are prepared diligently :-)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an Americano recently and had a great experience. The guy at the bar was great--super friendly and helpful. Overall, I think they're doing everything right. The only downside was that I came close to the end of the day, so they didn't have the regular coffee brewed, but that's completely understandable.  The quality of the coffee itself was quite good, though I can't say it blew me away. I like my espressos strong, and I felt this one to be just a bit on the softer side.   Overall, I'd come again."}
{"text":"I think one would be hard pressed to find sandwiches as delicious as those served at 9 Bars.  The wraps as well as their other sandwiches are truly outstanding. The reason? Their sandwiches are prepared throughout  the day to ensure freshness; sandwich fillings comprise tasty ingredients and compatible combinations. The result? Yummy delectable sandwiches. A must try. In addition to their excellent freshly ground coffee, 9 Bars has a welcoming ambience and very friendly staff. I know that I will go back there again and again."}
{"text":"Nice addition to this area. The staff friendly and the decor nice with some seating. They offer sandwiches as well as the usual coffee shop pastries.  Unfortunately the Americano I ordered was lacking and not satisfying.  The four stars is mostly for the location.  The coffee would be two to three stars."}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood. Their coffee is pretty strong and it is good quality coffee. I usually order hot chocolate. Their hot chocolate is very good. I usually go late morning time. I can stay there for a while and relax. People in the shop are casual and the staff is nice."}
{"text":"We all know Yonge St & St.Clair Ave is a bubbling place where everybody rush by, and sometime missing the point...The point is that, if you really slow down and focus in the moment, can realize that a single little think could make your all day. A deep brown, creamy and full of aroma Espresso Macchiato.  Making an espresso is just pure Art. You have to be highly skilled to get a shining silver-plated machine to slow down, approach that sharp turn, and fluently speed up like an Italian fast car to create that 5-Stars perfection.  9-Bars is a warm, welcoming place were time is meaningful, and gives you that well deserved pit-stop refueling moment... a very loooong moment..."}
{"text":"I had the toasty almond drink made with almond milk. It was very tasty and surprisingly frothy and creamy for a herbal tea made with almond milk. Nice ambiance, delicious drinks. I would like to try their sandwiches and other treats next time. Yum!"}
{"text":"I visited here with a good friend and had lunch. To my surprise, they offered non-dairy milk for all drinks (YAY!). What was even better than the food & drinks, which were fantastic, was the service. I should have asked for their names but the 2 gentlemen working yesterday were EXACTLY what I would want if I owned a business. They were incredibly courteous and went out of their way to make each customer feel welcome.   We stayed for over an hour, and during that time, I witness other customers be downright rude to them, and they never let on like anything was wrong. They still maintained their professionalism and kindness. The man preparing the food even came over to our table to move the plant that was somewhat in our way, and even apologized (which was not even necessary).   If the owner/manager is reading this, you seriously owe these 2 gentlemen a raise. I hope when we visit in the future that I see them again :). Great place and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nine Bars is a great new spot right near Yonge & St Clair.  The space is open with a fresh, rustic feel and big tables.  During my brief stay, I enjoyed a half sweet mocha and a bocconcini & sundried tomato panini sandwich.  The coffee was fresh and the right balance of flavours was struck, and the sandwich was toasty warm and was bursting with tastiness!  The staff was busy but friendly, and I wouldn't hesitate to return to this spot during my next stop in Toronto."}
{"text":"The guy who owns the place is amazing a really nice guy akward hours but other than that it's great"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and a nice space to hang out. I had their misto and it was very well made. Their chicken schnitzel was also really good. In the 2 weeks we spent in toronto we tried all the well rated coffee shops in toronto and this place would be one of the top."}
{"text":"Great coffee and atmosphere. 9 bars has staff that makes you feel at home and coffee that tastes like they know what they're doing. My friend's iced mint tea was dreamy and just the right amount of delicious to come back for."}
{"text":"Owner and staff are chill and friendly. They made me feel like a regular on my first visit. They understand how to make a good espresso, from the fresh, locally sourced beans, to the carefully practised pull. Interesting and different food options. Seating is well set up for business meetings, making it an excellent local choice.   Great stuff!"}
{"text":"good : great coffee and good location :-) bad : bit pricly"}
{"text":"A very friendly spot with great coffee.  If you have an appreciation for a good espresso, 9 bars is definitely worth a try"}
{"text":"This is an amazing coffee shop, with great Americanos and cappuccinos.  It's great for both done in or take out.  The owner is really friendly.  It's great to have an indie coffee shop in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I needed breakfast and my coffee fix this morning so my made my way down to 9 Bars. I entered into a nice cafe with a great atmosphere. The barista and cashier could have been a little more engaging, but seemed friendly.   I ordered a Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Spinach that came with a side of chips which I found quite interesting. I also had a small brewed coffee.   The Sandwich was nice and crispy on the exterior and had a very moist interior. The sandwich had a nice cheesy taste and was neither bland or too salty. The coffee tasted like it was freshly brewed and had a medium blend to it. This seems like a place u can go to on a first date as it is a great environment for socializing. I intend on returning to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Terrific cafe. The staff are extremely friendly. The food is fantastic. They are creating a wonderful community of regulars."}
{"text":"Great coffee and fresh and yummy egg and asparagus wrap. Place has a warm welcoming feeling and the staff and service is great. Too bad I don't work in the area else I'd be here everyday. It would be perfect to meet clients or friends for a drink or bite."}
{"text":"Yummy tea, nice decor, and friendly staff. The gent at the counter was nice enough to give me a second cup of tea for free! I insisted on paying but he insisted on comping. Much appreciated :)"}
{"text":"I was greeted with a big smile and served an excellent cappuccino. I was very glad to see they serve the same espresso as my downtown favourite Sam James.    A refreshing change in a neighbourhood filled with chain coffee shops.   Soon to be regular."}
{"text":"This is a cute little coffee shop that is hidden away from all the surrounding big chains near Yonge and St Clair. The service is quick and friendly so you can be in an out quickly. The drip dark coffee is flavourful and smooth. I've also tried a cortado which was wonderfully creamy. While I've never tried any of the treats at 9 Bars, they are always in abundance and look super yummy. Will be my goal for the next trip. My only criticism would be that it's pretty chilly in the winter because of the garage door front and open concept."}
{"text":"So I went into 9 Bars the other day with a friend for our tea/coffee date catchup and it was a great experience. It looks like a reasonably small space, but once one gets inside it expands and is actually fairly large.   I ordered a cup of their vanilla rooibos tea.... AMAZING. Their sandwiches looked really good and given the review prior to mine, I was tempted. But, I was low on cash and stuck with my tea. It came to $2.10 and it comes in a large mug, just the way I like it....  I will return to this place when I get the chance and try more of their goodies!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this family owned local business coffee place. To me it is more than just a coffee place. It is like a third home (second home would be a gym :D). They have excellent Italian coffee and it is waaaaaay better than any coffee corporation in Toronto. And they also have excellent chicken wrap and some dessert. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great Indy cafe with amazing food, drink and owners! Only problem is when cigarette smoke often wafting inside and filling the air."}
