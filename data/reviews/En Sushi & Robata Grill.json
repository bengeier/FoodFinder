{"text":"I will start out by saying this used to be the BEST sushi place in Henderson... Fresh, delicious and unbelievable Tuna. 

The reason for my 2 star review is the place recently changed hands... not sure if ownership has changed or just management (as I was told). 
The quality has really gone down hill and in my mind is just another sushi spot in town. I used to pick up from them 2 or 3 times a week. I am sad to say I will not be ordering from them anymore. :(( 
I ordered last week: Spicy tuna rolls, rainbow rolls, crispy tuna rolls and all were just OK... I did not like the smell or taste of the tuna. Its sad cause they had superior tuna before. Now it is just not good. 

PLEASE bring back the old En Sushi!!!!

I miss the old staff as well... what happened to EN?"}
{"text":"wow... i thought best quality, service and product.....

i really enjoyed with my friend ....we loved everything there."}
{"text":"I do not hold Japanese restaurants on the mainland to the same standard as those in Japan or Hawaii.  But I do not expect it to take 2 hours to get an order from the grill.  The problem was that there was one cook and one waiter for the entire restaurant on New Years Eve. Apparently the other cook and server were off.
They were out of corn/potato which is supposed to be their specialty.  We ordered Yaki Soba but were served Yaki Udon which I did not even see on the menu.  
The good news is that some of the food was quite tasty when it did arrive.  All of the Robata items had that great charcoal grill flavor.  The waiter tried very hard but was overwhelmed by his task.  Both the cook and the waiter actually broke into a run trying to do their job.
I am hoping it was just a bad day, and I will try again."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite local sushi haunts. In the past, we would be willing to make the considerable drive from Summerlin. Sadly it has changed ownership and gone WAY downhill in terms of everything that matters: quality,quantity, value, and service. What originally started out as a 4-star establishment for us can no longer be recommended. Our recent repeat visit was even worse than a disappointing experience from a couple months ago. We should've realized something was amiss when the restaurant was practically deserted during prime hours on a Friday night. Apparently we're not the only ones who have noticed a change for the worse. We're sorry to see this one fall, but we will not be returning."}
{"text":"my wife and i are extremely picky about japanese food--it's our favorite cuisine.  we have eaten sushi, teppan, and robata from san francisco to tokyo.  En is as good as it gets.  and how lucky are we that it's the closest japanese restaurant to our house?!  unlike the very racist reviewer below who basically said that a korean run place can't make good sushi, we don't care WHO makes the food as long as it's GOOD.  and this place is FANTASTIC.  our kids love it, and we love it.  their fish is fresh--surprise surprise, that happens to be important--unlike the ethnicity of the sushi chef.  the tofu is HOMEMADE--if you like agedashi tofu, En's homemade version is a delight.  not many places serve robata grill food and en's is excellent.  the service is very friendly and we've become such regulars that the wait staff know exactly what our kids order every single time.  when we leave for vacation we always look forward to coming back home and having a meal at en.  

A good meal is a good meal and friendly service is friendly service.  Our favorite japanese restaurant in the world happens to be in henderson, NV.  nothing wrong with that food snobs!"}
{"text":"The freshest and most buttery UNI I've ever tasted. Very attentive. Hands down the best off-strip sushi restaurant, especially if you like to eat on the daring side of sushi."}
{"text":"Hard to find hidden jem. Some of the best rolls I have ever had. Love the Robata grills on the table don't miss the potato corn skewer. Friendly staff the decor is a bit stark and the music lacks but the food is top notch."}
{"text":"I have had my review removed twice here.  It's pretty sketchy.  

I honestly reviewed my experience there.  I'm Japanese, and know my sushi.  The sushi was horrendously bad, made by someone who obviously has no experience.  

If you are not familiar with what real sushi is like, it may work for you, but for me, it was a waste of my time and money.  I would not recommend this place for sushi."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Great decor but service is average and the food is just average for the most part. The spicy garlic edamame is very flavorful. That was the most impressive dish we had. But not enough to get me to come back."}
{"text":"I think this is as it gets at least in the South end of the Valley.
The service was wonderful and the food delicious.  I eat here once per
week recently.  For a quick, in-expensive, light lunch the bento boxes
can't be beat.  The beef teriyaki was cooked to perfection and you can 
have dark meat chicken if you like instead of the standard dry chicken breast.
I may have to go back tonight after writing this!"}
{"text":"Dude this place went downhill...this fish is not as fresh as before...the Ginger is horrible...the new guys dont know how to make sushi rolls like Sean and Yoshi...they have a lot of learning to do...En Sushi was my favorite place to eat sushi...I know i am not going back. :("}
{"text":"The sushi here always surprises me.  It is exceptionally fresh.  The service on this particular night was a bit lacking, but the food was, as always, excellent."}
{"text":"The place is an an unassuming shopping center in a high end neighborhood in the burbs of Vegas.  Once inside, I was surprised that it wasn't that big.  However, the decor and cleanliness was nice.  The service was good, except I think that the hostess/mom forgot to put in our appetizer order, so that took 20 + minutes to come to our table.  However, once it did come, it was terrific.  They patiently waited for us to finish the apps before bringing the rolls.  I could tell the rolls had just been finished, and they didn't disappoint.  The quality of the fish was outstanding.  Probably the best sushi I've had in my life.  At first I was a bit surprised there was no soy sauce or wasabi with it, but honestly, it would have just ruined the flavor.  There was already plenty of sauces on the rolls depending on the one you ordered.  The Spicy Spider roll was our favorite, but you probably cant go wrong with any of them.  Will be back...so glad I went here rather than a steakhouse for a bday dinner."}
{"text":"This restaurant is now called Sai Sushi as they changed ownership recently.  We have traveled across town for years to our favorite sushi place but now we don't have to go outside Anthem!  We have now been there a few times and wanted to wait till after visiting a few times to write a review as to make sure one visit wasn't a fluke.  We have been pleasantly surprised at the quality, flavor and cleanliness.  The only thing we can say that needs to be improved on is to add another server now that word is spreading about how good it is.  But they are so nice and accommodating that is really isn't a big inconvenience.  The sushi chef Aiden is excellent.  Very consistent and very good.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Having lived in Southern California most of my life it was never an issue finding a good sushi place.  Now that I live in Las Vegas I depend more on my Yelp friends to steer me in the right direction. And they didn't fail me when I was in search of a fairly close sushi place.

My all time favorite sushi restaurant has to still be Tsunami Sushi on HB, CA (http://tsunami-hb.com/ , http://www.yelp.com/biz/tsunami-sushi-huntington-beach), but En Sushi is a very close second. It has a great atmosphere and very friendly staff. 

I started off with an Iced green tea and spicy garlic edamame. The edamame is great.  My friends started with an Uni shot, seaweed salad, and had a spicy salmon hand roll.

I had a craving for Albacore sashimi, which is what led me on this adventure, and the chef said the salmon was very fresh, so ordered the salmon and the Cajun albacore sashimi, both were very fresh and tasty. I wanted to try one of there rolls which they have quite a selection of, so I went with the Spicy salmon roll with extra masago. Wow, it was a lot of food but I finished it all."}
{"text":"It is my first sushi venture in Las Vegas area, for a good reason. I am very skeptical of sushi restaurants that are not located within 50 miles off the coast. Sure stuff can be flown everywhere, but restaurants along the coast have a distinct advantage of real fish markets within close proximity. That and Vegas's demand for the ultimate mainstream and average-American friendly thing doesn't quite mean good sushi in my mind. Where dragon rolls are the mark of quality, for me it is quite the opposite.

However, this place was recommended by a worker at my favorite ramen place, so it had to be tried. Tucked away in Henderson in a seemingly empty corner of some retirement community, this is a nice simple modern place with plenty of counter space and an open robata grill to the side. Menu has nice simple Japanese cuisine as well as the dreaded dragon roll that everyone looks for. 

We sat at the counter with Jun-san, the head sushi chef. He was very friendly and was happy to see that I was a passionate sushi enthusiast, gave us uni from a hidden fridge as well as some domestic kobe beef slightly torched. All the fish came from different sources, such as tai from Japan and chu-toro from Spain, which tells me he puts good thought behind fish purchasing. 

Some great aspects of the kitchen is that they hand-make their own tofu as well as udon. Did not have room for udon but I did try their agedashi which was done very well with light but richly flavored dashi broth. Tofu was soft with a great texture. From the robata we asked for chicken meatball (tenuku?) which was really a hotdog shaped chopped mixture of chicken and herbs, grilled and smothered in sauce, and my favorite, a fresh egg underneath it on the plate that allows the runny yolk goodness smother itself all over the meat (they ask you if you want it when you order, in case you're squeamish, but ahh I love runny eggs). 

The fish wasn't the freshest but I was told that Sunday is not the best day of the week for him. Apparently Thursday is the day to go. But the uni was nice and sweet, chu-toro nice and firm, and Jun-san treats the ikura himself.

I was told that this is the best sushi in Vegas area, and I'm ready to believe it. I am no fan of Nobu and this is a great place to be away from all the blinking lights. Overall it was a very pleasant find and I was glad to dine there."}
{"text":"We tried this place based on yelp reviews.  We were early diners arriving around 5:30 as we were headed to an event at the Pavillion.  At this early hour they were already out of their signature potato dish and one other robato item that Don ordered.

My sushi was very average."}
{"text":"So I'm sitting at the table here at En Sushi stuffed to my eyeballs. Thanks to the other reviews on Yelp for reccommending this place. It is a real gem in the Anthem/Green Valley area. The decor is hip n cool and the staff is very friendly. The food is great. First off they hit us with a free Robata sampler.  The items were good & perfectly seasoned but still dont compare to Raku if that's what you're looking for.  Tonight we had the Agedashi tofu (delicious), the creamy rock shrimp (very nice), the unagi bowl (yummy), the Anthem Roll (ok), the 7-Hills roll (fantastic). We also asked them to do a special salmon sashimi wrapped in cucumber that was great with the side of fresh wasabi (very refreshing). The staff was wonderful and very accomodating to our many requests. 

A definite must try for off strip sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Thanks to all my fellow yelpers who reviewed this place. All the good reviews enticed me to go try EN and you were so right!!! My hubby and I both loved it. It's in my list of top three favorite sushi bars!!!! Maybe I'm just getting addicted to sushi but I know I will definitely crave this place in the future. Their Screaming Orgasm is bomb! I've tried the Hot Night Roll and Sexy Girl Roll so far and they were both yummy! The BBQ Short Ribs were tasty too!! Can't wait to try more rolls!"}
{"text":"Well, here it is my 100th Yelp.  

I can never ever be accused of being of not being a sushi loyalist.

I first discovered En in either 2007 or 2008...for the life of me I can't remember which.

I do know that it gave me much joy to eat sushi there.  I never went anywhere else.

Sean, Yoshi and the gentlemen that used to rock the Robata grill made for a truly wonderful dining experience.  I was sad when the Robata man left but still remained loyal.

They used to get a kick out of my boy eating all the exotic treats that En had to offer.  Once on Halloween, they even dressed him as a Sushi Chef.

Recently I went back with the boy and my GF and thought the sushi was as as it always was...delicious... but something did not seem right.

Though I could not quit put my finger on it, I thought that's it the magic is gone, I did not think I would be back.  And so I began to seek a replacement.

I did indeed go back again and there was no Sean or Yoshi.  The sushi was good, but the vibe seemed to have changed.  The service lacked all the sushi magic it used to have.

So all great things must come to an end and so do my Sushi eating days at En."}
{"text":"Party of 12, special ordered sushi and our own bottle of sake made for a perfect experience here. The sushi chefs made good on all the dishes that kept on coming. Great cooked food for those scared of fish, so there is something for everybody.

Got notice from the sushi chef that they had some special fish in so I drove down and enjoyed live uni. Thats what I call great service. Somehow I killed two hours here :)

Worth checking out, worth the drive, and will keep you coming back."}
{"text":"When I ate there the first time - they served our party wonderful food fair. From the rolls to the fried rice to the pork tonkatsu. Since I had good food and service the first time, I decided to call in an order for pick-up. I ordered a Spicy Tuna roll -
It smelled bad ! I could tell they served me rotting fish that had not been in a cold storage.
Thats too bad for them - since down the street from them - less than 5 miles there are several other excellent Japanese sushi places.
Needless to say - I will not be back there in a long time."}
{"text":"Oh how i love to wander away from the strip to find something worth eating and this place is one of them.  The decor is nice very hip and modern looking. the service is friendly. sushi is definately fresh. What made this place special to me was that not was it only sushi but it's a robata grill. the food felt like it's for izakaya. Little snackable foods to eat while you drink. the only downfall for it and it's not the reason i took off a star, but the problem is that it's pretty far from the strip."}
{"text":"Excellent service, nowhere near as loud or bustly as I Love Sushi (a place my wife and I do love), and actually much better, fresher sushi at better prices. We WILL come back and become a regular here. So close to home, and again, amazingly good sushi. Try the spicy yellowtail and Kim special."}
{"text":"Bravo to EN SUSHI......Been going there since they opened and they have an excellent Hamachi Jalapeno along with the many rolls.  If you ask for something specific they are more than happy to accommodate your sushi desires.  

Service is great too."}
{"text":"Review by a Japanese born and raised there.

This place is a hidden gem.
Who would expect a GREAT Japanese place on a strip mall in Henderson!?

I had so many unique, beautifully presented, and absolutely delicious dishes there.  
I had the most excellent tofu there (homemade) and is probably nothing like tofu you have ever had (unless you are from Japan).
Eat the tofu with salt.  If you think tofu is not worth ordering by itself, give it a try.

Another really memorable dish was a salmon sashimi wrapped in a thin slice of daikon.  I'd never had this before, and it makes my mouth water just thinking about it.

Their logo is one of the coolest I've seen...  The character \"En\" rotated 45-degrees.  Whoever designed this is f'in awesome."}
{"text":"I'm really sad.

The people that once owned En Sushi have sold the business. So what was once a good quality, very affordable Japanese joint has been converted to yet another subpar neighbourhood sushi restaurant run by people who don't know Japanese cuisine.

Let me give it to you straight. If see a menu that has rolls that have 12 ingredients on it, run far far far away. 

Although my husband and I didn't order any rolls, our companions did. The rolls were the circumference of the bottom of a coke can. Topped with all these ingredients, how can all the individual flavours come through? What was the chef thinking? Well, obviously, soaking it a dish of sauce is an obvious answer to this question. If it wasn't messy enough already, it sure was one hot messy meal then.

This is not sushi. I don't have a name for this atrocity but it certainly is NOT sushi.

If the legit-ness of this place didn't plummet right then and there, it hit the proverbial rock bottom when they served the paper thin slices of sashimi, cut incorrectly. Inside I'm cringing because we told our pals that this place was good.

Tempura was overly hard and thick and wasn't nearly as delicious as it was from my previous review. Plus they seriously cut down the portion sizes from my last review.

And a final note, they no longer have the ongoing offers for free food either that I mentioned previously. Even if they did, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"We elected to try this \"sushi\" restaurant under the current owners after nearly a year and, unfortunately, it has not improved.  Under the previous owners the fish was always fresh and well prepared and the \"sushi chef owner and his assistant\" were always full of great banter and responded honestly to which fish selections that day had the best taste.  Very much in a true traditional sushi bar manner!  This evening I ordered traditional sushi pieces just to see how the preparation and taste would turn out--hamachi, sake, ono, maguro, unagi, saba, ama ebi, etc.  No rolls!  Starting with the rice it tasted somewhat bland (a starch taste) and no hint of wasabi.  As the fish pieces came out some had a \"fresh frozen\" taste.  The \"hamachi\" had the best appeal but not by much.  The \"ono\" was thinly sliced and the unagi sauce was bland.  The oil used in frying the \"ama ebi\" needs to be changed and the \"shrimp head\" itself was pretty small.  I could go on but I think that speaks for itself.  If you desire a true and traditional sushi experience you might want to go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night for dinner. Although my expectations were high from reading all of the good reviews, ESRG's underwhelming quality wasn't even close to what I would expect of a 4+ star establishment. It was a disappointing experience.

The overall design and ambiance of the restaurant is nice. Clean and modern feeling. The service is satisfactorily friendly.

For dinner we ordered an oyakodon bowl and a robata and sushi combination. The miso soup was okay, but had no seaweed in it. Not awful, but miso soup should have seaweed in it. Next came a spinach salad with a touch of vinaigrette on it. Extremely boring and not tasty.

The oyakodon bowl was okay. The skewers of grilled chicken and fish I received with my combo dinner were drier than beef jerky. The nigiri slices were cut too thick. Although I appreciate the generosity, it's not fun to chew on a slice of salmon that's too thick.

A fairly unremarkable sushi restaurant. There are many far better sushi establishments with slightly more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This is my revised review from 5 to 3 stars.  I was eating here 6 times a month for the past year plus, but now ....  Fake crab has replaced the soft shell, the sauces are different and even the appearance of the rolls has changed.  I'll check back in a few months and see if they have gone back to the way they were:-("}
{"text":"AMAZING!  We have gone here a few times now and really have no complaints.  My husband is a cooked sushi kind of person and I am the raw plain sashimi type.  En gives us both the variety we crave.  

The prices are pretty reasonable, I mean I pay 5.80 for 3 thick pieces of fish and the rolls are the same price.  They have a full bar as well with decent pricing there too. Our waitresses have been great the last few times we have been there.  The first time we went, eating at the sushi bar itself mind you, we had to beg for refills.  Not the past few times. 

At the end of every meal, hang around and have them make you the orange.  The sushi chef creates a great bunny out of an orange as your dessert.  So creative and a nice way to end the meail."}
{"text":"Dear En Sushi,

We surely do miss you and all of the money we spent at your restaurant. You are way too far of a drive and we became unfaithful after discovering...RAKU!  

We miss you En Sushi and sad to hear that \"Mr. Miyagi\" went back home...

Sincerely,
Your Xmas Photo Ornament 2008-2009"}
{"text":"Here on a quiet Thursday afternoon. Staying at the M, so we decided to take a short drive to check this place out. Not another table in here, but you know what, I Iove it. 
Atmosphere is relaxing and the food is delicious. I've been in the service industry for 20+ years and I know a good place when I eat at one. A restaurant doesn't have to be packed to be great. 
Lunch special was fabulous. Would recommend."}
{"text":"New owner - what a BUMMER!  The service isn't as good, the food was just terrible, the music and ambiance is all different.  Mrs. Megan was great and she is definitely missing now."}
{"text":"We think this place rocks because of it's unique dishes and the flavors were right on. If you're looking to try a variety of Japanese dishes, this is the place for smaller 'tapa-like' dishes and may be what you're looking for. Coming from California and having been to numerous Sushi restaurants around the world, this one will be one of our regular spots. 

Btw, service is equally as fantastic! 

PS: A good roll, I think, is the Transformer Roll. Tuna Poki is great and so is the Chilean Seabass Skewer (Robata)."}
{"text":"This sushi experience was pretty good for me. We got there and the place was empty - granted it was about 8:30pm which is really late for this area. We got to sit at the sushi bar with our 2 kiddos which was really nice. My sushi roll was very fresh and the eel sauce not too sweet. My boyfriend's beef teriyaki was very good and he kept raving about it.  Our server made this experience amazing. We let him know we had never been there and he accommodated very well explaining things. My son went to the restroom and the door was too heavy for him and he couldn't get out but we didn't hear him crying for us, but our waiter did. And around the corner came our Server in shining armor with our crying child.  Kudos to an attentive waiter and really good sushi chef."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi restaurant with a very friendly staff. We originally went to a different place, and when trying to go back a second time ended up at En Sushi thanks to my phones bad GPS. 

This has become our sushi place and we are scared to go try anything else since we know how good it is. You can also get small kabobs of NY strip steak and fresh vegetables. 
Every time we have been it has been almost empty, which is fine for me. Last time we went in the chef was taking a nap on the bench, but awoke and was still able to prepare us a great meal.

5 stars all day."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! It's unexpectedly nice inside, the service is great, it's quiet and the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Awesome quality to say the least. Good lunch specials. Very fresh ingredients. I am very loyal to this place. Just wish they had a AYCE option and longer hours. Service is great but slow, so plan your visit with some time to enjoy. I love the grilled foie gras and sea bass, and the lobster roll and sun devil rolls are delicioso!"}
{"text":"Pretty Darn Good!

Lots of selection, fresh fish, great rolls and really good appetizers.

The one knock I give them is that they put too much sauce on everything so that your rolls and sashimi tend to be swimming in juice/sauce. So we always ask them to go easy on the sauces, and that helps.

I'm not a big fan of the \"grill\" part of the menu.  We've ordered off of it a couple times, and the meat tends to be dry."}
{"text":"Big sushi eater here.

The place is really beautiful.  The dishes and the decor are pretty, and the little details of the place really set it apart.  The prices are very reasonable, and the sushi is delicious.  The service was efficient, but baked and fried rolls do take a little time.  The presentation of each piece of sushi is carefully thought through, and it's beautiful to look at as well as delicious to eat, as good sushi should be.

The robata grill was a unique touch, but nothing to really jump up and down over.  I'd suggest getting your sushi, and ordering a few skewers from the grill just to sample, as they start at just $1.50 each.  

I love Dynamite, and every place I go, I sample their take on the dish.  En Sushi's dynamite is among the very best, and among the most unique, as well.  It's almost like a seafood dip, complete with chips.  While not my absolute favorite version of sushi, it's still up there.

Great value over all, and great place to take a date, or anyone you want to impress.  Go on a weekday."}
{"text":"Very good quality sushi and I love the Robata grilling technique very flavorful meats and veggies.  Definitely a great place to check out.  The service is always friendly as well."}
{"text":"So we finally decided to eat here last night after the first attempt last week but we saw no one in the restaurant or cars in the parking lot,  oh they were open as you can see the neon light saying open was on and we saw a chef behind the counter,  but we left and decided to go elsewhere. 
We should have known better when we noticed there was only 2 other couples inside the restaurant.  don't get me wrong their sushi was ok,  but not something to go crazy over and must have. I have had pretty darn good sushi from Smith's and it's in comparison to their sushi here. 
And the Robata grill...  first of all they don't do foie gra no more and our server told us they were out of portobello mushrooms and sushito peppers, big disappointment there which left me No choice but to order the steak and chicken...  whipptey frickin do!! 
We had to practically look for our server the entire time we were there even to get refills on our water & get this,  he left before we did!  The sushi chef was the one that closed our check out and we were the last ones there shortly after another couple at the bar left before us. 
I don't know if this place has gone downhill from the last time customers were coming here posting their food pictures. 1 star rating for this place because of the lack of knowledge and service by our server and the items I wanted to try on their menu wasn't available. Definitely never coming back. Trust me when I say that there's a reason why their parking lot is empty...  that's always the biggest sign!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi was good, service was pretty slow. The place was packed and En only had one waitress for the entire restaurant. They need to hire at least one more waitress to get 5 stars."}
{"text":"The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the drink menu is a bit neglected.. if they had as much creativity in their cocktail menu as they do on the Sushi menu then it would be a 5 star for sure.

So, here's the review.. I have already been there too many times to count, they know us well and I might be a bit spoiled because of it but hey, we kept going for a reason.

The sushi is very fresh, I'm pretty picky about that and if I even get a slightly off odor I'm outta there.  

You can tell that they have given a lot of attention to cleanliness and detail and for a sushi place, that would be very important.  No fishy odor in the restaurant at all.. not like other places I won't name! The creative menu, cleanliness, freshness, friendly staff, loyalty, open to creating individualized sushi for you, and ambience all make this the place to go for sushi lovers.  

We've done \"I Love Sushi\", Ka, Spicy Tuna, Nobu and just about everywhere else and we keep coming back here..

Make sure you try the foie gras from the Robata grill..it's a winner! The Saba with fresh wasabi will get you addicted.

For those with negative reviews.. how? I can't even fathom how that happened at En Sushi."}
{"text":"Everyone who knows me and my sushi needs knows that I'm loyal to one sushi place. So when some friends insisted we try En Sushi in the bourgeois hills of Anthem, my initial response was, \"Pshh... why bother?\"

This place is unassuming and could easily be missed. It's small and cozy with chic and modern decor. There is a lot on the menu but everything, and I mean everything we tried was delicious from the corn potato to Hamachi Kama.

I raised my eyebrow at some of the prices of rolls like the $18 Anthem Roll, but boy oh boy was it worth every penny! Every roll was huge and beautifully presented. The fish was fresh, the sauces were delectable, and there wasn't an overwhelming amount of rice.

The corn potato was a cute (for lack of a better word) and tasty appetizer. We also had the baked green mussels. The crab layer kind of masked the green mussel flavor but they were delicious nonetheless.

The waiter found out it was me and my husband's first visit there and they generously gave the whole party free strawberry ice cream! I had already planned on raving about this place on Yelp and this was icing on the cake.

My only complaint is that it's quite a drive from our side of town but its worth every mile. So, the moral of this review is don't be afraid to venture out of your sushi comfort zone. You may be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Have to update my review. They have redone their menus and dropped the Bento Boxes. They have replaced with Chicken or Beef Bowls. Also, they have lower prices than the Boxes. Almost as good. I still recommend."}
{"text":"EN, you've certainly gone downhill ever since the Mon Group(Sushi Mon-Maryland Parkway, Sushi House Goyemon,Monta Ramen) let you go...yeah, you've kept things like potato corn and foie gras custard with cold noodles, but the quality is just not there, it's at RAKU(Chef Endo was one of the opening chefs)

We also shared the tempura dinner, robata dinner, and I was curious to try the Monkey Special after some food critic raved about it in the Las Vegas Weekly...Tempura was just like any other joint that serves tempura, the Robata dinner was good, with the exception of the Salmon and Chicken Breast-way too dried out.

The Monkey Special-tempura fried plantain slices topped with imitation crabmeat, tuna, and drizzled with yum yum sauce and unagi glaze had a pretty good flavor, but would have been even better if it would have had REAL crabmeat...What a shame...once, a cool place to enjoy awesome food, now, just okay for me...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"I go here with my dad whenever I visiting my old people.  

The atmosphere is nice and the service is great.  The chefs are friendly.  The menu has a nice selection, although not anything too different.  However, En is reasonably priced and tastes wonderful  So much of Vegas sushi tastes like a mix of Chicken of the Sea mixed with dirty carrots.  En is my favorite sushi place in the area!"}
{"text":"I had a hard time deliberating if I should give this 4 or 5 stars since I don't like to usually round up to 5 stars.  However, service, cleanliness, food, and uniqueness all were good enough to have me push it up.  The place is very clean, the ambiance soothing, and the decor has a great Japanese feel.  

I'm ashamed for not writing about this place sooner as I have eaten here a few times already.  The service is very friendly.  Everyone greets you, and they have a genuine smile on their face.  They seem to always make sure that the customer is taken care of.

The food is very well done.  The sushi and other food are aesthetically pleasing along with very delicious.  The Robata Grill picks are very good.  The tofu salad is probably one of the best that I've eaten except that I've learned how to make it myself since I love recreating foods.  The corn potato is different, but not bad.  The NY Steak skewer had a bit more to be desired, but not a bad idea.  The chicken meatball is delicious, and the calamari is superb although I don't think the tartar sauce quite fits the bill as an accompanying sauce.  However, it tastes great by itself.  The creme brulee and cheesecake are homemade along with one other dessert which I forgot at the moment.   They were also very satisfying. 

As always, it does take a lot to make a place 5 star worthy, yet this one seems to just have made it.  It was an enjoyable dining experience here.  They also took a picture of us on a polaroid to hang on a tree so that the customer with the best artistic picture will win some type of gift.  I just wonder how they will give out the gift since they didn't take any information."}
{"text":"Love the food here especially the wonderful garlic tuna dish. The reason I cant give it 5 stars is because the service is consistently poor to awful and very unprofessional.  Not to be a jerk but sometimes the young ladies here are braindead. In fact one time I took guests we waited over an hour and a half and the waitress only returned once during the entire time so being that we were there to eat sushi we were planning on ordering a lot more. Id also like to point out that it wasn't that busy. One couple actually went straight to Wendys afterwards so they could \"have dinner\", quite embarrassing for me as the host. When a member of the dinner party explained our disappointment to the server she giggled and said \"oh\". Frankly because of this situation I will only go back when I drive by and see its really slow and im craving the garlic tuna. Very disappointing because I love the food"}
{"text":"This place is always awesome!!!  My wife and I had another great meal last night!!!  Thanks Yoshi for the hospitality!!!

Its walking distance to Coventry Homes!!!  Yipeeeee"}

Nice..."}
{"text":"We have eaten here 4-5 times and each time have had excellent food.  On our last two visits we took friends who also really enjoyed their meals.

We mainly eat off the dinner menu rather than ordering sushi.  Robata grill, tempura, chicken teriyaki have all been delicious.  Menu seems new and expanded as of our last visit.  I enjoyed the combo meal that had noodle soup (full of big, thick noodles) and tempura.  Our friends liked their sushi although I didn't get any details.  

On earlier visits while the service was OK, waiters/waitresses hadn't stood out as being particularly friendly, but our last couple visits have seemed much better.  In fact, our waiter last time (who said he was relatively new there) seemed truly interested in our friends' opinions on the sushi they had ordered and he was pretty talkative - in a good way, not annoyingly so.

We will return."}
{"text":"Food has gone downhill since early this summer, I will not be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"I love Yelp! When I was craving Yakitori and driving my husband crazy this place completely fit the bill. My husband was happy with his sushi which given how fickle and picky he can be I say this is a good thing."}
{"text":"We had a very enjoyable dinner here last night, with tempura, edamame, several different types of sushi, salad, miso soup, and chicken teriyaki.  The food was really good, we would definitely return.  The atmosphere was unexpected, it was dark from the outside because of the windows and no one was in there (minus us, for the duration of our meal).  However, there are cool walls, lights, chairs.  We thought it was very unique and pretty.   I was really worried the fish would be old, especially if people are not going here in droves, but everything was fresh.  Our server was attentive and nice.  Everyone thanked us on the way out.  We will return.  And I hope their business picks up!"}
{"text":"If you live on the East side of town and don't feel like driving to Raku, then I recommend going to En Sushi and Robata Grill instead to get your Japanese fix. I have only been once since it is all the way in Anthem , so I can't give the most complete review, but I will say everything we had was above par and the space was superior to that of most neighborhood restaurants.

En's decor is clean and modern - definitely a place suitable to take a date. The staff was all friendly, though there weren't quite enough of them. Despite the fact it took a little while to get out the food, the waitress was attentive and everything from the grill came out hot.

The robata items didn't have the intense charred flavor of those at Raku, but they were good nonetheless. The corn stuffed with sweet potato ($2.50) was on the mushy side, but the other vegetables were crispy (the shishito peppers were especially good, $1.25). I'm glad the chef of both Raku and En, Mitsuo Endo, has created a robata trend that is being followed by a lot of Japanese restaurants, but the way the robata is used at Raku showcases the cooking method better than any other, including En (I was just in Raku last night marveling out how they could get so much flavor into a cherry tomato that looked like it had been on the grill for all of two seconds). En also makes their own tofu, but sadly they were out of it when we were there so I couldn't say how their version compares to that of its sister restaurant.

One thing you can't get at Raku, however, is sushi, so if that is what you are after to complement your robata craving then come here instead. The Yellowtail Lover ($12) was a successful roll prepared with thick slices of hamachi and a creamy spicy filling complemented by the acidity of a spicy garlic ponzu. The individual pieces were sized appropriately, and it was better than most rolls I've had. Anyone who likes Sushi Fever will be happy with the creative Americanized sushi menu here."}
{"text":"Holy Anthem Shopping Center!  and THANK YOU Blair B.!!!!  I finally decided to get here, and it took 2 calls to the restaurant and my inability to comprehend that going up the hill on Eastern is south and not north to get me to find En.

I arrive, sit at the bar, and meet Chef Jieun (sp?) and Chef Sean, and everything-man Yoshi.  Yoshi recognized me as cuckoo lost lady on the phone (in a nice way) and was glad I made it.  The service was outstanding.  I got iced green tea (what a surprise), and ordered the homemade tofu agedashi style and the Japanese eggplant with bonito flake from the robata side to start.  The agedashi tofu came with 2 shishito peppers (yummy surprise!) and the eggplant was delicious.

Then Chef Jieun hooked me up with the perfect saba sushi with shiso leaf and everyone seemed amazed that I like mackerel.  I also got complementary spicy garlic edamame in that time.  Then I asked for yellowtail jalepeno sashimi and told em I like it spicy, so Chef Jieun snuck in 2 thin slices of serrano peppers on the fish to spice it up more, plus yuzu sauce and yuzu-ponzu-chile sauce.  I ended up pouring the sauces into my soy sauce dish for later.

Then I got a salmon skin handroll complete with gobo root and avocado (after watching it get blowtorched, sweet!) and robata foie gras (sauce on side - not a fan of teriyaki).  Yoshi gave me the house special corn-potato to try and the corn had a hint of sweetness and that great grill taste.  At the end, I also was graced with free vanilla mochi, too much to eat!

Refills aplenty, Yoshi gave me a to-go cup of iced green tea without my asking.  So generous!  Plus a really good discount/free food card for the next visits.  I need to get back for whole scallop sushi and Spanish mackerel on the weekends.  Togarashi on the tables, a very welcoming atmosphere, and great conversation.  I sat next to some guys in town for the Hoover dam bridge opening, and they found En on YELP!!!!!! I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Normally, I hate rolls. But somehow I love it here! I haven't tried any of the noodles or dinners. I always come for lunch and get a mixed meal with rolls, sushi, etc. So delicious! The cinnamon tea they serve at the end just makes my experiences even better. The restaurant is also small and peaceful. Extremely convenient too. Love it!"}
{"text":"This place is great! This is hands down the best sushi place in Las Vegas, they have the best staff, the best ambiance and of course, yes the best sushi! I just can't say enough about it. These guys sure know their stuff. Sean and Sue are the owners and they always make sure we leave super satisfied and FULL!  Yoshi is also a sushi chef and sake bombs with him is a MUST! They have flatscreen T.V.'s so you can watch sports while you eat great food! What can be better?  Yasu san is the Robota KING!  He treats that charcoal and skewars better than some people treat their children! He's always checking and turning making sure the temperature and texture is perfect with every piece. My husband and I go here whenever we are craving sushi. One time we actually went 5 days in a row!  We have tried all the other places like I Love Sushi, Ka, Sushi Mon, Kabuki and any other sushi place that is close by. No one comes close! Whenever we have family or friends in town we always bring them to En, now when they come back they always ask if En will be one of the places we will go to. We always reply with an enthusiastic YES! They think we are treating them but really, it's a treat for us!

Service is awesome, they even deliver which is great for those days when one of us is sick or we're tired from a long day at work and can't make it there but really REALLY want sushi.mmmm.... just thinking about it makes me want to go there right now! 

Must try: red snapper special sashimi, california salad, beef tataki, anything on the robata menu, actually, anything on thier menu is a must try, who am I kidding trying to single out any dish!  :-)"}
{"text":"OK,  I have gone back twice now since the first time and I tell you the food is consistently awesome and fresh.

I only order from the Robata menu. That is what makes this place so different!"}
{"text":"Review by a real Japanese.

This is a Korean ran joint and they don't do anything right.  Sushi rice was wrong, sushi cuts were poor, the balance was hopelessly mistaken.

My son had Tonkatsu and even that was completely botched.  

There is no redeeming quality here.  If I could give negative or zero star, I would have.

Another Chinese/Korean pseudo sushi disaster."}
{"text":"I didn't think it was possible.  At first it was like a mirage.  I thought \"In my neighborhood, a real Japanese restaurant?\"  It's very real and very terrific.  I have been eating here for about 6 months so I should mention this by now..

I have had almost everything on the menu here but I'll just mention what I think is the best.  I don't often get the robata other than a side of nasu but it's pretty good too.  I like sunomono salad, agedashi is terrific, chirashi is plentiful, takoyaki for a snack, and tonkatsu for lunch.  The people who work here are very kind and the service here is always terrific.  I eat here a lot when I am not feeling well to try and improve my health."}
{"text":"Great service, generous portions...so far my favorite Japanese restaurant in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Out of the way place -- En Sushi was a drive (and we were already staying in Henderson) but well worth it. 

Went on a Saturday afternoon. Place was empty and WYATT, my three-year old, stretched out on the padded bench and promptly fell asleep (so the rest of us had an unhurried, two hour late lunch -- a nice plus). The atmosphere was casual, the decor seductive and the service relaxed, personal and attentive. 

The premium sake we had paired well with everything we ordered and our little ice carafe was well attended (frequently refilled) by our server. 

The miso, one of the usual Japanese restaurant choices of JULIANA (my five-year old) had lots of the housemade tofu and was her all time favorite. Sadly her shrimp tempura was a bit undercooked and the oil wasn't quite hot enough (so the batter was a little greasy). 

From the robata we did not specify how we wanted them cooked and the kobe (nothing special) and the duck breast (the basalmic made it) were both medium well and not the medium rare I would have preferred. (And i, a notorious tough reviewer, still gave the place four stars -- yeah, it was that good.) The beef tongue (which we had after the foie gras) was good but (in the same teriyaki sauce as the foie) not particularly distinctive. The corn-potato was just, plain fun. 

The foie gras was OMG. 

We (it was a party of four) had three cut rolls (Sexy Girl, Candy Cane and one whose name I can't recall), a salmon-skin hand roll plus white-tuna (yes, I know it's not really tuna) and uni sashimi. Sauces were more subtle and complex than the usual chili-mayo and sweet soy concoctions you get at the typical American sushi joint. 

i know the review seems overly critical but to tell you the truth i was really wowed. Really a good dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been twice in the past couple weeks and this is my current favorite sushi place in Las Vegas ! The sashimi is always so fresh and tasty. The cuts are generous. The robata grill stuff is an awesome addition. The owner and other sushi chefs are friendly and fun. 

I will warn you the suburban douche population is HUGE at this place. The sushi bar is always crawling with tools from Anthem that have never eaten sushi before and freak out about every single item they try \"OMG it's salmon..OMG this is the best salmon I've ever eaten\", etc. If you can get over the suburbanites by all means you must go here!"}
{"text":"I used to go here almost everyday when my office was just across the parking lot.  I loved their lunch specials: chicken katsu/ salmon teriyaki/ sushi/ sashimi with miso soup and salad for about $11.  As soon as my number shows up on their caller ID, they already know what I want...unless they have a new employee.

One time I miscalculated how much cash to bring but instead of asking me to walk back to my office to grab more money then pay them, they told me it's fine.  Sure, it was only  a dollar but still.  So, I went back in the afternoon before going home to pay them.  They're really nice!

They have good food and I've often wished they had AYCE but at the same time I'm glad they don't otherwise, I'd weight a ton!"}
{"text":"I have been going to EN since they first opened and it is always great!  The fish is fresh, the rolls are unique and the same chef's are always there and are great!  Everyone that works there is very friendly and remembers you.  

I love the BAM BAM roll, but have had so many rolls there.  They are all really good!  Lisa Lisa, Something Wrong, on and on...even the simple rolls and sashimi are wonderful.

The purple haze is pretty cheap sake but tasty and I love having it once in a while (when I'm not having green tea).

Their homemade desserts are delicious!

About the prices: I feel they are very reasonably priced, especially for the size of the rolls and the quality of the food.  If you get a specialty roll, they run about $13 but it's enough to fill one person up.

Love EN!!!"}
{"text":"During my current week+ long holiday break from work, I've found myself eating out constantly and absolutely stuffing my face with some of my favorite foods at some of my favorite restaurants  The goal is to seemingly be unrecognizable from the weight gain upon returning to the office.   The one exception to going to all my current favorite restaurants was a revisit to what was one of my favorite restaurants from a year or two back, En Sushi & Robata.  I ended up here with some friends early last week before going to the movies, and upon request from the one friend who had never been, we found ourselves there a 2nd time merely 3 days later.  

First I'll start by mentioning that I read many of the previous reviews, and while I knew a little about the previous ownership having something to do with the Mon Group (of which I am a big fan of generally), but I don't really follow restaurant ownership as much as the most Elite of Elites.  I did however notice a small diminishing of enjoyment in En's food about the time others were posting about the change in ownership, so I must say I'm convinced they may be accurately describing how things were, and it's possible it's the reason we stayed away for quite some time.  As a matter of fact, I hear so little about this place anymore that during the drive there the first visit, I considered that it might actually be closed.  When we arrived I was happy to see it was still there and open, though it was extremely empty for a Saturday night.  The next visit had a few more customers, but certainly not a full house

Here's a rundown of the items we ordered during the two visits:

1)  Pretty much every veggie skewer (robata) dish.  These are my favorite selections on the menu.   We always need multiple orders of the zucchini, asparagus, and button mushrooms in the least.  Also really enjoyed the japanese eggplant.  Shishito peppers are a favorite of mine as well.  The potato corn is really tasty and basically tastes exactly as it sounds, but I don't find it a necessity.  These all run about $1.50-$2.50 a skewer, and you seriously can't go wrong just ordering 5-6 of them to start

2)  Other robata:  I also usually get the NY Strip and some of the fish robata as well.  I must say I enjoy the veggie robata more than the meat/fish ones, which if you know me at all you'd find absurd.  This isn't to say they arent bad, but the veggie robata should be a priority

3)  Garlic Edamame:  Big edamame fan, and can almost never resist it on any menu.  This version comes slathered with some garlic chili oil sauce that I find very tasty.  When no one is looking I can be known to suck the edamame pod clean off of this sauce before eating the edamame themselves.  Worst visual of the year?   Probs.

4)  Sushi:  I'll first admit that I am by no means a sushi snob.  While I enjoy sashimi and nigiri as much as the next foodie, I can also put away roll after roll of oversauced, nonsensical rolls that use ingredients that are probably illegal in Japan.  Not of that variety is the Yellowtail Jalapeno dish, which is pretty standard at a lot of sushi restaurants but I find it a very good version using fresh fish here.  On these two visits we also had the \"Angry Beef\" roll and the \"Hot Night\" roll.  Angry beef was a roll stuffed only with veggies, but then surrounding it on the plate was a sizzling portion (think fajita style) of beef, onions, and mushrooms.   I think the idea here is to take the piece of veggie roll, and cover it with the other fixins.  That's how I did it anyway, and I liked it quite a bit.   I have no idea what the Hot Night roll is except that it was fried, I think it had cream cheese, and it was covered with crab.  Oh it also came with a dish of 2 sauces, of which I have no idea what they were.  I'd just dunk it into both and eat it.  I'm an animal.   

I was a little disappointed to learn they no longer carry foie gras as it used to be one of my favorite things to order.  It still is listed on the menu like the proper tease that it is  Yes, I did consider dropping it to 4 stars for this alone. 

Everything was priced fairly, especially the robata skewers.  Service on both visits was fast and pleasant.  

If you've never been or if you haven't been in a while, I'd urge you to give En a(nother) shot.  I was glad I did.  So glad in fact that I'm giving it a coveted 5 star review and the honor of being my 100th.    Arigatou gozaimasu!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here the other day at 7pm. I enjoy sushi once in a while so I decided to give it a try.

1. Atmosphere 10/10 the place looked awesome, used traditional Japanese plates, and was so clean you could eat off the floor.

2. Service 10/10 they waited on me like I was royalty.

3. Food Quality 10/10 the sushi was absolutely delicious. Some of the best Ive ever eaten. It tasted like it was fished out of the ocean yesterday thats how fresh it was.

My only issue was the cost. They dont have ALL YOU CAN EAT so prepare to spend $$$. But its well worth it."}
{"text":"Yep,  En has totally dropped down my list since they were sold a few months ago. Don't expect the same service or quality that you did."}
{"text":"I just can't seem to enjoy myself when I come here, the service is pretty bad.  Had the same waiter that I had the first time alone and he's just so nasty that I don't want to go here anymore.  Considering the fact that the two times I have eaten here, there has been absolutely no one here. You'd think they'd treat us like they were glad we came?  Nope, instead the waiter acts like we've inconvenienced him by coming by.  Asshole.

I was with husband and instead of having sushi,  we dug into the robata grill offerings.  They were ok, but nothing that I felt was amazing.  The steak was pretty bland, but the chicken and salmon weres decent so I'm giving them one extra star for that.  But it was too expensive for what it was, and the charcoal flavor was not really there.

No, I won't be going back here EVER."}
{"text":"This place is under new ownership!!!  They are doing a great job and the sushi is better than ever.  I can't wait to see what the owners are going to do with the menu and they are going to add a happy hour:)  I could eat here every day.  I ordered mushroom tempura, which was not on the menu,  and they ran to Von's to make it special for me.   Awesome!!!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! To me a real sushi restaurant will have fresh wasabi and this place does. Forget that green paste and get some fresh wasabi for you favorite sushi dishes. Now for the food, I haven't had a bad dish in this place. Spicy crab handrolls for only $5.00 is the deal of the day everyday."}
{"text":"This is our favorite spot for sushi.  It's rarely busy and the food is always fabulous.  We went again Friday night, and the service was a little off.  We had to wait a long time for our order, and they forgot my rib-eye skewer.  The sushi was top notch, though.  My husband ordered a trio of sashimi and the presentation was exquisite.

We will continue to go back because the quality of the food, the presentation and the price is worth it.  We do wish they'd bring back the watermelon sorbet..."}
