{"text":"What a great place. Took my daughter out for her birthday. Francisco and Christina were wonderful and very attentive. Steaks were great as well as the martini. Nice wine selection.  And yes do try the cream corn. Daughters first creme brûlée. She loved it of course. Money well spent. 
I have to agree with some of the other reviews. \" hidden gem\". Will be  back for dinner with the wife and friends."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! Highly recommend besides the food the staff was very friendly and tentative.Will go back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for dinner and was greeted by a smiling and friendly hostess. Our server was a sweetheart named Heather, she made us feel like we had been coming here for years. She recommended wonderful item on the insert for specials and even from the menu. My husband had the Prime New York cooked to a perfect medium. I had a blackened seabass that was melt in your mouth wonderful. Heather recommend the twice baked potatoe so delicious. To end a wonderful experience she prepared a table side Berries Jubilee that was flaming awesomeness. When we dine again we are asking for Heather."}
{"text":"My Husband and I went to dinner for our 20th wedding anniversary.  It was a perfect evening. Jason was our server, and it was perfect, and everyone else from the hostess, bartender and everyone else we encountered were the best!  The food was delicious, couldn't thank them all enough!"}
{"text":"Food and Service very good. Can improve on the lighting of the place. Too dark. I understand the private environment they want to create but when you go on Business, darkness and candlelight are not good. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"BEWARE ALLERGIES! Thanks for making me sick tonight, after I told you about my allergies.... I'm sure it's not the chef's fault, he was nice and apologetic, our server however, barely paid attention and asked me if my severe allergy to dairy was just an intolerance. He obviously didn't take me seriously. Wish our last night here was not spent in the bathroom. BEWARE ALLERGIES!"}
{"text":"Food is really good. Seabass is amazing there. the surf and turf special is great deal"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to going to this place.  Particularly, because of the Prime Rib special.  I enjoy a nice prime rib at a good price.  The price was good; the food was not.  Three of us ordered the special, one was slightly undercooked, and the other two were not cooked at all.  All of them appeared to be cooked... until you cut into them.  It looked as though they had not seen the grill, let alone cooked properly.  I thought, they opened the package and put the meat on the plate.  It was just wrong!!!  Especially, if you are going to a nice restaurant; the least you can hope for is a decent cut of meat.  The salad and bread were very good, but not enough to make up for my disappointment.  The waiter was able to remove two of the meals from the tab, and that is why I am giving this place two stars.  Also, I found it odd that the Manager did not offer an apology for the food.  That is customary in high quality restaurants.  Obviously, the only thing that is high in this place is the bill.  Save your money and time!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on the day after Valentines Day with the girlfriend in an attempt to make up for working on the big day. For starters i wish there was an entrance so you didn't have to walk through a group of slot machines to get there. Sunset Station wreaks of smokers and walking through that is kinda gross. We were shown to our seat which while most couples were offered booths, and I had reservations, we were sat at a table in the path of the kitchen. 
Our server was excellent though and offered great pairings to go with our meal. Every course was excellent and well worth the price paid. The ambiance however left some to be desired. Between being nudged each time a server needed to get by and the group across from us drinking at a large table while in their sweatpants (even though there is a sign at front requiring decent dress - i guess it isn't enforced) made this a ho humm experience. I'd go back because the steak was done perfectly, the double baked potato was amazing and everything was prepared very well but not too soon or regularly."}
{"text":"Had a dinner here with my husband since we wanted to try something local and not on the busy strip. We booked reservations via Opentable.com and stated we were celebrating an anniversary. 

We arrived at Sunset Station, the casino is your typical Vegas casino, nothing too special although they do have an IMAX theater on the premise. Anyway, we found our restaurant after looking at the directory. When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised. The ambiance was lovely, the decor was nice. It was very comfortable and the staff were attentive and humorous. We ordered a Rib Eye, a Porterhouse, sides, and wine. The food came promptly and we were provided with a basket of different breads which were warm and fresh. At the end of our meal, the waiter surprised us with a large piece of carrot cake with a candle! 

I've given it a five star rating, because we throughly enjoyed our meal and the dining experience. -Another visit in the future is a must!"}
{"text":"My go to place when I'm craving for a good steak. I usually get the bacon wrapped shrimp and chopped salad as an appetizer, they are amazing! Then for the star of the show, the bone in ribeye steak, it is so tender and very flavorful that is if you don't mind a good marble on  your steak, if not do the lean cut and tender filet mignon. The charred sweet corn and creamed spinach for sides are must try as well. But the best part of the dinner are the long time servers that makes us feel special, always attentive and top notch service. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"I liked this place and gave it good review last year.  Their  featured Thanksgiving menu looked interesting but it was terrible.  The food was cold and had to be sent back twice for reheating.  The desert was yucky and ugly.  The waiter didn't seem surprised that the dishes were barely touched.  What makes it all the more galling is that the meal was $35 per person and we left hungry.  Horrible.  We expressed our dissatisfaction to the manager and he said nothing.  Happy Thanksgiving---Not."}
{"text":"We love the happy hour, especially the bartender Christina.  She has made us feel so welcomed and made some great suggestions on appetizers and drinks. We have found our new hangout."}
{"text":"Steak night last Saturday at Sonoma. We are frequent customers at Sonoma and will keep going.  Great filet and big fans of the mac and cheese. I can always count on Great food and great service. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Had dinner for the first time the food was great!  Wine list is excellent and fair prices. Had excellent service by our server David he was very attentive and knowlgable! I would definitely recommend this place all around!"}
{"text":"We always wanted to try this place out so we figured why not today. The ambiance is very nice and was actually pretty surprised when I walked in. We were greeted by a number of folks and was presented with warm bread.

For a steakhouse they're fairly cheap but you do get what you pay for. I ordered the aged prime ribeye (med-rare) and she got the chicken. We also had a side of mac and cheese and the lump crab cake. 

The Mac and cheese and the lump crab cake were extremely good. Too bad it ended there. My ribeye was cooked a little on the rarer side and was rested for too long. By the time it arrived it was on the cool-warm side. The chicken dish she ordered tasted pretty bad. It was cooked fine and might be a personal preference but it did not taste good at all. 

We didn't really want to spend any more money here and their desserts weren't anything special. For the amount of money we paid, I would have preferred something much better as in Lawry's or a steakhouse on the strip. I probably would have been happier eating a bowl of cereal at home. 

3/10 Mac n cheese is pretty good"}
{"text":"The hostess greeted us as we entered for our reservation (from Opentable. com) and promptly led us to a table. I'm in a wheelchair and they had placed us in a very accessible yet private area. The decor here is beautiful. I believe that it alone is a stress reliever. The Wait Staff folks are knowledgeable, competent, quick, and friendly. Our food was superb. The different flavors were brought together perfectly. Each item was served at the proper temperature in an eye appealing manor. My Wife and I had a very relaxing and stress less evening. We lingered over coffee and dessert. We went home satisfied and calm. In my opinion this is not a place I would bring children."}
{"text":"I went for a date night and they restaurant wasn't too  busy. I started with a glass of storypoint I ordered the filet medium and the corn. The steak was excellent and perfectly cooked. Service great and we will be back again."}
{"text":"After hearing great things from many people we finally went in for dinner tonight and it was beyond amazing! Started with onion soup and kale salad, both so tasty! Followed by a bone-in ribeye and some surf n turf, also delicious! Steaks cooked perfect, lobster was so sweet and the potatoe au gratin was the perfect side dish! Aside from food the bartender Tony is just great and Diego the GM made us feel right at home! Overall a great spot for us, close to home, good prices and above average food! If you're looking for an amazing steakhouse off the strip you'll definetly be happy with this place!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! Went to this restaurant three times throughout our week journey.  The food, service and above all quality was outstanding!!!
Coming from the Chicago land area we have access to wonderful steaks
This restaurant surpassed many we have been to which out of courtesy I won't mention.
And I didn't even mention the salads which were enough to split.
You won't be disappointed !!!"}
{"text":"You can call this a hidden gem. The restaurant has a cozy feel when you walk in. Service staff was extremely attentive and the food seasoned perfectly. I had the bacon wrapped shrimp, onion soup and the bone in rib eye and all were excellent. I have found a new favorite place to dine! Great selection of wines as well. Save room for dessert because they have a good selection. I couldn't decide because they all sounded good. Guess I'll have to go back!"}
{"text":"Sonoma Cellar did not live up to past experiences. Four ordered filets medium rare:  one was very rare, the other almost medium well. As a child was served the rare filet, one of the adults switched her medium rare for it. The gentlemen receiving meat too well done, said he would eat it, but wanted the waiter to know about it.  He was offered to have a filet butterflied and recooked quickly---not what you want when paying over $30 for a piece of meat. Some compensation would have been nice.  The waiter acknowledged the overdone meat, but a dessert or drink would have been appropriate considering the time and cost involved if the gentleman had insisted on having his meat cooked correctly.  Salads and sides were all delicious, but the three eating them had GI distress within two to three hours of the meal. The two who ate only meat and potatoes had no issues. Sadly, this five star restaurant only hit a three star grade 8/26."}
{"text":"Had a great birthday dinner there, the Porterhouse was one of the best I've had in Vegas, and the price was much better than you'd expect for the quality.  This may be my new go-to place for steak.  Shrimp Cocktail was big and tasty as well.  Would definitely come back and suggest to others."}
{"text":"First real steak place I've tried since living in Las Vegas, plus it's literally 2 miles from my house! I tried the petit filet (med rare) and the asparagus, and of course a glass of red wine.  The steak was cooked perfectly and tasted incredibly flavorful!  The restaurant is beautiful and the night we went there was a live singer/keyboardist belting out Frank Sinatra tunes, etc.  Waiter was informative, relaxed and pleasant.  Overall the experience was above average.  We took our grandson, who got a little loud, but since we went early at 5:30...and wasn't too crowded, we didn't feel like he was a bother.  He had the amazing mac a cheese!"}
{"text":"In town on business, and stopped at the bar at Sonoma Cellar to watch the football games. Great and welcoming staff to share the time with. Great happy hour food and drinks. The crab dip and sliders were perfect. Will plan on stopping by on future trips."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time last night. Supposed to be 3 of us, but one of the group felt ill at the casino, so we drove him home and came back.
We were greeted by two hostesses. Both very professional and great attitudes. I believe the names were Christina and Jessica? Anyways, if I were just talking about them they would get a 5 star review. They couldn't have been better. But then we were sat.
Our server Brian seemed more interested in anything but being at work. The best way to describe his service would be what you would imagine you would get if you grabbed a server out of a greasy spoon dive diner, and then told him to wait on tables here. We were shocked out how non-caring, how inattentive, how 'going through the motions' he was. At one point he asked one of us if he wanted another drink. Well no, since the current drink was still more than half full. 
While we were talking to each other how we would expect such good service (especially since several reviews talk about Brian's merits) and it never was there. Then at the table across from us, there was a female Asian server that was superb. she described things the right way, with elegance and class. She seemed to belong in a higher class restaurant.
The Oysters Rockefeller was dried out, and a big pile of breading over the tp. Not worth it, very dry. I think this is how they make them, but it is not a good dish.
The steaks were good but overpriced. I'd say Carve at Eastside Cannery is much better. You get a salad and sides for less with classier service.
Would not go back. I would have given two stars but the two hostesses were better than expected."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of randomly trying this place last night. Upon walking in we were greeted by two very nice girl that then showed us immediately to a table. I was happy not to wait at that point since I was starving. 
Keith the servers assistant was prompt ad immediate with service and honestly made the experience. Every patron at the restaurant you could tell love this guys service and attentive mind set. He was never anything but a step ahead of the game. So kudos to Keith. Eric out server was good but not overly attentive for a nicer establishment. He could pick up his personality a little bit and be an all star, he just seemed a little off beat and not to willing to go above and beyond like Keith was. 
The food!!!! 
I got the brick chicken , she got a New York strip. Both were great, chicken lacked and it's accompanying suave lacked distinction as was more like something I would put on a sandwich, the breading was perfect and even but just lacked any true flavor.
The New York strip was done perfectly medium rare. Melted in your mouth and was just honestly a great steak. The sides were great but I will mention the twice baked potato as the all star. That was done perfectly and seasoned impeccably. Well done.
So I will return and get a steak, the food took over a half hour to come out but we were in no rush, I suppose if we were then this would of gone to 3 stars."}
{"text":"The service and quality of food continue to be outstanding. The flash fried peppers and lump crabmeat are great apps and the meats are high quality cooked to perfection. The wine list is decent but expect to pay close to 300% mark up if not more for the bottles. Unfortunately they scrapped the draft beer which is always a sad move especially for a steakhouse. Overall, the fantastic food with the kind and attentive service makes the cellar a great place to have a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Jason & Edwin have been our servers & have provided amazing service. The chopped salad before the dinner is a must. 1 salad is perfect to split between 2 people & if u ask they will put it on 2 plates for you. They have this special sauce to dip ur steak in that is drippings from another meat. You dont need to dip the steak in anything cause its so good but this sauce is too amazing. With salad, 2 steaks, wine its all around $100. Def not bad for amazing food, great service & atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was good. I ordered the surf and turf. The sides and salads were really tasty."}
{"text":"After two weeks on business in Henderson, you start to realize that your options for dinner after 9pm are limited.  I had a couple of hours to kill one night while running errands, so I decided to give Sonoma Cellar a try.

It's a bit nerve wracking driving around Henderson at night when you have no clue where you are going, but I soon came across Sunset Station.  A short walk through the casino, which is kinda homey actually, and I had arrived.

I was so excited when I saw the menu.  Yes, I will have that La Crema pinot noir for a reasonable price!  And also the fried Japanese peppers, oh how I love them.  They arrived in a huge basket.  So delicious, but I couldn't even make a dent.  Definitely a good choice for a group appetizer.

I ordered the filet for dinner.  I was happy to see that there were a variety of sauces available to go with it.  I chose the cilantro sauce and it was very tasty.  I also had some cheesy potatoes, also way too much for one, a good dish to share.

All in all, the food was very good and the service was just right.  I was kind of surprised that such a cozy, romantic place would be located in Sunset Station, but this is a great choice for a nice evening out."}
{"text":"Ate dinner there last Saturday night.  Place was nearly empty at 9pm. Not a good sign.  I ordered the caprese salad - two thin FROZEN slices of tomato with firm mozza on top.  A little vinegar on top.  That's it.  One of our party bit into his steak and found an  1 1/2 piece of bent metal (part of a paperclip??) in his mouth.  The chef came out, apologized, and offered to cook a new steak.  Security came right away to take a report, but chef had already thrown the steak and metal away in the garbage.  One would think he would save it to show his meat vendor or something/someone.  Unbelievable.  Oh - they graciously offered to take the steak with the metal off the bill - how NICE!!! We should be so grateful!!!  Please......"}
{"text":"I would give it a 5 but I'll need to revisit. The service was awesome. Food great. Prices very reasonable for a steakhouse.  Hue, our server was really nice and engaging. He took great care of us!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy coming here. Our waitress Poom is so cordial and attentive with us!!

Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Our family has come here for the last 15+ years. We came on Christmas for dinner. Didn't get in until 8 pm. No food until 10pm- some items sold out. Fine.. Grandma wanted to come for her birthday so we gave them another chance. Her potato was ROTTEN. One side forgotten, one meal undercooked, etc. Place has gone down hill. Never going back."}
{"text":"I have been to sonoma cellar numerous times and this past time the food was horrible. To start, they must have cut costs because they got rid of there really good pretzel bread. The salad came out after receiving the entrees and was missing main ingredients. The steak was so under cooked it was cold and raw inside. It took about 40 minutes to get the entrees. The only good part of the meal was the bartenders friendliness and hard work. Stick to the happy hour if you choose to dine at this restaurant. Beautifully renovated but Overpriced and overrated. Management should address the kitchen issues so there isn't further incidents."}
{"text":"The place is beatiful, the food was ok, nothing spectacular...  The service was SLOW!!!!!  we all got rather irritated over how long it took to get our food, and we all ordered the same thing, the steak and lobster, we must have waited almost 30 min... 

I doubt i will be returning."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. We had the Ribeye and Filet Mignon & Lobster, the meat was cooked perfectly.  The sautéed mushrooms were great and the garlic mash and broccoli were ok. The staff was friendly with the exception of our server. He seemed aloof and was not very attentive."}
{"text":"Horrible service, 30 minutes to get dry steaks and it was not even crowded in the restaurant! What a waste of money to dine here! Trust me people do not waste your time or money at Sonoma unless you want your night ruined"}
{"text":"Thursday night I went to dinner with a friend in the Sonoma Steakhouse. The Steakhouse was nearly empty at 7:30 when we were seated. Francisco, the waiter was attentive to detail and the food was good. My petite filet mignon was top quality, but the Caesar's salad seemed like it had been made several hours earlier. All in all, the dining experience was above average and the atmosphere was intimate and classy."}
{"text":"Six of us had a birthday dinner here and it was superb.

5 of us chose the 3 course dinner special for $35.  Great value as you chose an appetizer/salad, entree, and desert.  This special is only available Sun-Thurs.   If you want sides with your entree, you will pay extra which is common in high end steak places.  

I also chose the 3 wine paring which was only $15 for 3-2oz flights of wine.  Excellent.

Steaks were great, as was the lobster/scampi  comb that was the special of the day (but not a choice for the 3 course meal).

I tried the Japanese fried peppers as mentioned by a prior reviewer, and everyone loved them.

Also had Isreal as our server - just awesome.

We'll definitely come back here for special occasions."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews I was skeptical of coming in for dinner.  Took the risk and gave it a try.  Had a great steak dinner in a beautiful and cozy environment.  The servers were very nice and helpful.  I would definitely come back for the King Prime Rib
."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Great atmosphere, very competent staff. The woman who waited on us, if I get her name I'll edit my review, was outstanding! She was super friendly, very knowledgeable and she honestly seemed interested that we had a nice dinner 

The steak was easily the best steak I had every had in my life. I got the Filet and it was amazing. As I was thinking it was the best steak I had ever eaten the friend I was having dinner with said ''I think this is the best steak I've ever eaten!'' LOL Great minds think alike. 

The chocolate cake piece they give you is as big as your head and DELICIOUS! It can easily be shared. 

Everything was spotless, wait staff was very attentive, and the food was fantastic. The prices aren't even bad considering the quality of food you are given. Five stars in my book and I certainly hope to go back."}
{"text":"Pretty much the best steak and meal and service so far in Vegas. A ultra find in my guide and I am super particular!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other night with family who were visiting, and all I can say is WOW! The food, service and ambiance was EXCELLENT. I mean, the food was really, really delicious. This is an expensive restaurant but the food is worth the price for a special night out. The bread basket they serve- complimentary- was full of variety (raisin nut bread, pretzel bread, sourdough) and really tasty. I ordered the lobster bisque (TO DIE FOR) and oysters rockefeller, and was in heaven while eating. I tasted some of the special - filet mignon, jumbo shrimp + garlic mashed potatoes for $38- and everything was spectacular. Our server, Poom, was so lovely and personable, too! Very friendly and attentive and she made our dinner even more enjoyable. To top it off, we were gifted with two creme brulee desserts (we had a couple of birthdays + my white coat celebration) on the house....they were also to die for. Just thinking about everything I tasted is making my mouth water.

The owner/manager even came out at the end to ask how our time was. Highly recommend this restaurant for a special occasion, date night, or anytime you can afford! I will absolutely return."}
{"text":"Excellent! The food, the service, the ambience. I came on a recommendation from a coworker and I would definitely recommend to others and I will come again. The twice baked potato was delicious, the salads fresh and steak cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Filet and Lobster are about as good as it gets. Great atmosphere and a very classy place to eat. We have been going there twice a year for over 15 years and Jayson has always been our server., he is the very best, You don't stay at one restaurant that long without being one of the best. He makes sure every thing is cooked the way you want it. I would not make a trip to Las Vegas without a trip to Sonoma. I would pick Sonoma over Hanks which the food is also very good, but way overpriced and is not the great atmosphere of Sonoma, a little to formal for my taste."}
{"text":"great dining room! great food! great service! great prices!
got there at 5 pm (open for dinner)
heineken/champagne 
bacon wrapped shrimp
oysters on the half shell

broiled scallops
porterhouse steak (medium rare/broiled) perfect!

one of my favorite lv eats!
(i live here!)"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar for some simple munchies and Tony was tending.  I knocked down the shisito peppers, bacon wrapped shrimp, and the oysters Rock that the kitchen was willing to make GF (without crumbs).  I was pleased to be introduced to a brand new amaro for my palate.  Go say good evening to Tony--he'll treat you right!  Thank you, sir!"}
{"text":"I had the blackened halibut, sweet potato, green beans, broccolini & sautéed mushrooms, everything was AWESOME!! 

Our party of 7 did wait a very long time before our food came, it felt like 1-1.5 hrs wait time & the place was nearly empty, the service was good and everyone was friendly & courteous!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my dining experience here. Food was delicious, especially the steak. Interesting side dishes and cocktails to die for. The staff was super nice and attentive, and the manager even stopped by the table to make sure we had everything we needed. I would definitely recommend Sonoma Cellar to anyone looking for a great night out."}
{"text":"About 6 years ago, I tried this restaurant and was impressed with the food quality and affordable prices. Back then, you could order a rib eye , or filet  mignon for about $10-$15 cheaper than you could on the strip.

 Like many hardworking people here in Las Vegas, the economy has forced me to order # 1's at McDonald's now instead of eating at high-end steak houses. 

I was so happy when I saw this place advertising a prime rib dinner special for $12.99.  After calling to confirm the special price,  we made reservations and even got dressed up for the occasion. 

We ordered 3 prime rib specials ( 2 medium, and 1 medium well). They all came out underdone and almost cold in the center. Are you kidding me? Medium and medium well to me is not blood rare (almost blue). My wife sent hers back, while I chose to eat around the outside of my prime rib. 

However, not everything was disgusting as the prime rib specials. The chopped salad was a nice appetizer with a perfect blend of cheese, bacon, and dressing. The best side dish was the sonoma potatoes which were fried and sauteed with onions. 

To their credit, they ended up not charging us for 2 of the prime rib dinners. Good thing they did, or this would have been a 1 star rating. 

I am so disappointed! Oh well, back to McDonald's."}
{"text":"This place could be the biggest secret around!
Great steaks and great prices!
Also a wonderful wine list!
The bone in rib eye is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great lobster and steak special. Check the station website for deals. The head basket was heavenly and our waiter was great."}
{"text":"The place aspires to be a fine restaurant...and really, it's just about there.  The steaks are very nice and represent a very good value.  If it was twice the price (like many are) I would have given it one less star...because it just does not fall into the \"OMG that was insanely great\" category.  In short, I'd be pleased to eat here any time."}
{"text":"My first time trying this restaurant last night. Atmosphere was great, nice dim lights and classy music.  My service was good. The 2 Stars is simply for the food.  We made everything simple by ordering all the 4 steaks the same way, medium. The server said medium well might be a little dry and suggested medium if i like pink in the middle.  So be it!  All of our steaks turned out perfect except for 2 orders.  One had to cook it once more while the other had to cook it 3 times and still came out dripping blood (see Pic). I got tired of requesting to recook so I packed it Togo to reheat at home.  This is supposed to be a high end steak house yet they can't get the steaks cook right. Quite disappointing considering the whole meal for 4 cost me $200. ;("}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. We left the Vegas strip to come here and it was well worth the drive. The entire casino and property was amazing. Clean, and half the smoke smell. Sorry MLife hotels but you could take some lessons from these folks.

We will now make this a must do on our following trips. Kudos to restaurant staff, David and the restaurant manager for an amazing experience."}
{"text":"They made the best steak I've had in a while. Asparagus and baked potato were both very good. Creme Brulee was excellent. They didn't have a list of the beers they carried so I had to ask for several brands before finding one they had."}
{"text":"I dined here with my friends at the end of June prior to going to the Elvis Monroe show at the Madrid. Honestly...I love, love a great steakhouse and have been to many in this town and all over the US, and this place was average. However, what made our experience great was the service. Poom our server was AMAZING! She really made our dinner incredible, not only with her suggestions, but with her attention to detail, her friendliness and her sense of humor. 

We didn't try anything that was on the regular menu, we actually tried the specials that Poom suggested. We will return for the next Elvis Monroe show at the Madrid and give Sonoma Cellar another try. Definitely requesting Poom as our server. I'll be back with the next review. :)

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Price: $120 for two people which includes drinks, starter salad, entrees, a side, and dessert. 

I thought the price was very reasonable for the amount of food we got and the quality was excellent. My fiance and I both got steaks and they were DELICIOUS!! 

Dessert: I really recomment the caramel cheesecake!! Way better than normal cheesecake and a portion size that you can actually finish. 

The service was wonderful, it was a romantic atmosphere, so overall it was a wonderful date night. I definitely recommend this place and you'll see me dining here frequently!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I go here with my wife on special occasions. Being a local and having a Station Casinos' rewards card gets you great discounts at Sonoma. On this day we had the rack of lamb and filet. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted great. Would recommend.

The only reason Sonoma Cellar doesn't get 5 stars on this visit is because our waiter, although very knowledgeable and quiet friendly, was very pushy. He really wanted us to drink and kept pushing expensive bottles of wine. Again and again. He also insisted on the lamb and completely failed to tell me that I was buying a FULL RACK of lamb ($68 worth). It was way too expensive and way too much food for one person. Had I known I would've opted for the half rack or something else. I've had this waiter in the past and he was pushy the first time. I believe his name was Brian. I will ask for someone different next time."}
{"text":"Ok, so I had a horrible experience here a couple of years ago and have never made an effort to go back. Well last night I was invited by a very nice friend to revisit this place. I was dragged by my hair, kicking and screaming but got seated at the bar and mellowed out with a nice cold Dos XX beer. All of the fine folks there recommended the lobster cake appetizer. We each got one and my god, it was REALLY good! It was just perfect for me, as far as filling, but the taste and presentation was perfect. So today I must \"eat crow\" for being so stubborn.Thank you sonoma for putting the cap on the evening."}
{"text":"Another wonderful meal at Sonoma Cellar. If you'd like a special after-dinner coffee drink, that is currently not on the menu, ask for Francisco. He calls it the \"Bermuda Triangle.\" It's very tasty!!"}
{"text":"Great service! Javier and Juan were helping us and they were awesome  
Food was great. We celebrated a birthday and Mother's Day. We tried different types of soup and shared the entrees. I definitely will go back again and recommend you to visit.  
Park near the bowling entrance, is really close to the restaurant."}
{"text":"My first time back to Sonoma in at least four years, and I'm very sad to say I was not pleased at all. The last time here was great, the food the service everything was on point. This trip we went in hoping to build on past experiences. The start was us waiting at the hostess booth for the hostess to show up, not a big deal then she sat us at the table. I looked at my place settings at the table and noticed the dishes had several scratches from over use as did the silverware. The bread they brought to the table was not warm and seemed to be hard from sitting out to long. My wife and I had the chopped salad to start, this was always a great dish, sad to say this time it was really weak as if it was made and dressed the night before completely soggy and lacking any texture. We both ordered the filet which was not seared very well, and the meat seemed very dry. We ordered a bottle of merlot which we had to change to a different selection after the fact as they did not have any stock on the bottle we ordered. To be a high quality restaurant you need to pay attention to the details, sad  to say I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"After winning a nice little chunk of change at the casino, I took my parents here once for brunch.  I don't know if they still have it, but at the time it was under 25 bucks pp and included a basket of fresh pastries, fresh-squeezed juice, champagne, surf & turf eggs Benedict with potatoes & fried green onions, and chocolate dipped strawberries & petit fours for dessert.  What a fabulous experience!  Service was impeccable; the decor was very classy.  I wish all meals were this good!"}
{"text":"Everyone at our table had nothing but good reviews for this restaurant.  The steak was juicy, tender and perfectly prepared even though we all like our steaks done differently.  Raw oysters (Fanny Bay, my favorite) were extremely fresh. The lobster tail was small but tender and very, very good.   Drinks are a bit pricy but my Cosmo was awesome!  Our sides were very well prepared also. The baked potato is gigantic so think about splitting it.  

Service was prompt, friendly and professional. The surroundings are classy, and very attractive.  No one in our party could find anything wrong with this restuarant and we are definitely coming back.

I booked this reservation for 5 through OPEN TABLE and received a confirmation via e-mail.  
The restaurant had no such reservation but seated us anyway.  Not sure what happened here."}
{"text":"Steaks are excellent, had exquisite wine pairings with our 3 course meal.  We thought everything was up to snuff.  The only drawback is the cost but for a once in a while romantic splurging special occasion (and you do only have that amazing anniversary that one time but that creative 29th birthday is over & over & over!!!!!)  
The location is in the Sunset Station Hotel which is ok but if you overindulge you can always do the affordable local special or for out of towners, stay frugally during the week Sun-Thursday."}
{"text":"I am sorry to report that Sonoma Cellar has fallen off of my radar.  I have been a customer here for 20 years, this has been the steakhouse of choice for my wife and I.  We once celebrated my birthday
 here with over 12 guests.  When they opened there was a certain sense of pride in the food and the service.  Obviously the economic downturn was a challenge for all of us, this is not a good reason for scrapping a good business plan for a grind joint. We came here for my wife's birthday. First of all the décor has been changed, they lightened up the room and changed the lighting.  The menu has been pared down to a single page with a few categories. One saving grace was that even though the crab cakes had been taken off the menu the waiter was able to get us a crab cake.  It wasn't bad.  I ordered the lobster bisque for starters with the Alaskan king crab legs as my entrée, I added the grilled corn and steamed spinach as sides.  My wife ordered lobster with a filet and she ordered mashed potatoes for her side.  We usually have wine but my wife had a cocktail and so I ordered a Newcastle, after several minutes the waiter returned to inform me that they did not have Newcastle available so I just had water. Later at the bar in the casino I ordered and received a Newcastle.  The Lobster bisque was absolutely the worst lobster bisque I have ever had, it had a vinegary flavor and did not resemble lobster, in fact the only thing that made it edible for me was the pieces of crab meat from my wife's crab cake that I added to the bisque.  My crab legs were obviously not top quality and were very salty.  The lobster was unrecognizable as a lobster except for the shell.  The texture of the lobster was soft and the color was grey.  It was hard to believe that they sent this out of the kitchen.  My wife did enjoy her steak and the side dishes were well prepared.  They gave us a complimentary crème brulee after the table had been cleared.  The poorly trained and undisciplined wait staff did try to please us but they did not have the tools to do so.  If this is a house run restaurant then it is clear to see that Sunset Station no longer takes it food seriously."}
{"text":"Recently had dinner here with my family and really enjoyed the experience. 

The staff was friendly and attentive. The food was great although it could have been a little hotter.

Also I was surprised that gratuity is included in your bill. That's really too bad as I was going to leave a bigger tip. I found it a little pretentious that they automatically assume they deserve a tip."}
{"text":"What an awesome experience! This was the first time my hubby and I had some real money to spend and we decided to treat ourselves to a high-class restaurant. We were not dissapointed. 
All of the food was EXCUISITE, the service very fast, quiet and professional, the setting very high-class and very pretty. If your ready to spend a little more money to get the best of the best, this is definitely one of the best places to do it!"}
{"text":"This was an amazing surprise!
We went to the movies and were headed out to eat when we saw the poster promoting Filet and Lobster for $29.99!
Since it was early we were seated right away, the restaurant is really lovely and relaxing. Service was great and the food was....well, it was so tender and tasty...haven't enjoyed a steak like that in a long time and the sauces to top it with were delicious! The lobster was tender and yummy...started with a chopped salad which was also done very well...
This was a great experience and good value..nice to know they're still available with all the high priced steakhouses in town."}
{"text":"Came here for my son's birthday.  

BEAUTIFUL dining room.  Everything was so crisp and clean.

Service was a solid 95%.  They weren't busy, so I appreciate them not hovering over us, but we would have to wait to get water refills and drinks.

Food, I am not a filet fan normally... but this one was DELICIOUS!  Very tender and actually had a decent amount of flavor.

Cocktails - this is what made me almost give a 3 star review.... there is a bar drink menu and a regular drink menu.  No one ever said anything about it.  My husband ordered a drink and was told he couldn't have it because it was a \"bar\" drink.  VERY frustrating... especially since we were 2 tables away from the bar.  The server did finally get him ONE drink of it but then told him no more after that.  That pretty much busted the evening after that.

For the management - you should make sure the bar drink list is only passed around IN the bar... same thing for the happy hour menu.  My step father wanted the frog legs, but again... was told he couldn't have them because we weren't in the bar.... WHY IS THAT MENU GIVEN TO GUESTS IN THE DINING ROOM????  Especially when someone wants to spend money, LET THEM SPEND MONEY!

It just didn't set the tone very well after that.  Thankfully my son still enjoyed his dinner... but my husband said he will never return there even if the food was delicious... it is those little things that can make or break it... and unfortunately, that was enough to break him."}
{"text":"Nice decor and located off the casino floor. Had a glass of wine at the bar. An impressive wine list at this place. In the main dining are I ordered the Lobster bisk.....delightful. My girl ordered the crab/filet combo at at decent price of $34 dollars. It looked and tasted good. My new York strip about 10oz was ok but definitely not in line with the rest of the food. Side of spinach topped it off that was perfect. This place has a good staff and bartender however, hits and misses on the food quality."}
{"text":"First, I will start by saying that the one thing I really miss about living on the East side of Las Vegas, is going to Sunset Station Casino in Henderson.  Out of all the Station Casino properties, it is probably my favourite.  One of my regrets is that I never got to eat at this place while I lived over there.  However, I had some errands to do in Henderson yesterday, so I went here to gamble for awhile and I figured I'd eat dinner while I was there.  I love the fact the restaurant's design is very elegant and nice.  The staff was very friendly.  My Dad and I both had the surf-n-turf special for $34.99.  it was a 6oz. Filet and a Lobster Tail.  The steak was cooked perfectly and was very tender.  And the lobster was perfect.  We also shared an order of sauteed spinach.  It was the perfect size meal for the both of us.  They definitely had a lot of great items to choose from, which were priced lower than most of the places on The Strip or downtown, with just as good of quality.  Not to mention, we got there at 5pm, and we were out the door by 6pm.  So, the service is very good and very quick.  I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"We went there last night for my birthday dinner. The evening started off well, but slowly went downhill. The French onion soup was so-so, the Caesar salad was soggy, steaks were okay, the lobster was tough, the creamed corn was good, and the garlic mashed potatoes were cool and over-whipped. Not super impressed with the meal but it certainly wasn't horrible. However, when we tried to pay it took the server FIFTEEN minutes to get our card back to us. No apologies, nothing. He wasn't that busy either. Ended a decent evening on a sour note. Not impressed and we sure as heck won't be back. Why would we with all the numerous steakhouses in the valley? Sonoma Cellar needs to work on their service and the quality of food that is coming out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"What a surprise to find this Steak house in our hotel.  We were originally scheduled to have dinner at Maestro's but we arrived an hour before they opened.  We decided to head back to our hotel at sunset station and found out they had Sonoma Cellars.  We have been to alot of steak houses but this one really is the best.  Never had a better ribeye in my life.  My wife had the lobster which was incredibly delicious. Sides and appetizers were fantastic.  Best bacon wrapped shrimp.  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Must go if you drink Martini's. Anthony, the bar man has been serving drinks there since 1997 and makes the best martini I've had. Large glass and well done. 

Try the ribeye. Best value in vegas. Half what Mastros charges and just as good. Brussels sprouts were superb. Service is old school 

Highly recommend the place."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place out for a date night.
We started with the bacon wrapped shrimp and flash fried peppers.....very good.....you can put those peppers on anything!!!
We had a salad next...nothing super special but good!
I had the steak and lobster special I saw on the sign....perfect portion for me....I actually had some left.
My husband got the filet oscar style.....steaks were cooked perfectly and tasted great.
We ordered green beans and baked potato and didn't touch it because we were so full!
We did however save room for table side bananas foster....great presentation!
Our waiter was great as well.....
Oh forgot to mention we ordered a bottle of Sonoma Cutrer (one of my fave chards) very reasonably priced...we will be back!"}
{"text":"We still love Sonoma cellar. They have remodeled the restaurant and it looks great it's now more open. We went on Valentine's Day and had a wonderful time. I had the porterhouse and it lasted me 3 meals and still delicious the next day. They closed down our valentines tradition restaurant so we had to find a new one. They had a live singer that was pleasantly surprising and not overbearing. We don't drink but they do have an extensive wine list. We loved the mac an cheese with lobster very creamy. I would feel good about recommending this place to friends."}
{"text":"You can bet on having a good meal
For a good price with good service !
They always made efforts to take care of my family year after year !"}
{"text":"I was visiting my uncle last week and since we knew we wouldn't see each other for New Years, he wanted to go to a nice dinner. It was about 6ish on a Friday night, and this restaurant was able to accommodate our party of 3 without a reservation. 

We were seated right away, and bread and butter was brought to our table immediately. Our server, Jason, was ok. He didn't welcome us to the restaurant, didn't ask if we had any questions or ask if we had been there before. He just asked for our order. I got the scallops, with the truffle French fries, my mom got the petite filet with a baked potato and my uncle got the surf and turf. 

The food arrived within a good amount of time. My scallops looked good, but I could see that my moms filet was pretty dry.. and she usually goes for medium rare. 
I didn't try anyone's food aside from my own, and I was not too impressed. My scallops were overly salty. I usually don't like lemon on my food, but I had to use it to cut through the saltiness of the scallop. 

I did notice our server was quite friendly with his other tables, stopping to have conversations and ask how their meals were, but after our food was served he never did check up on us to ask if everything was ok, and not once did someone refill our water glasses. 

My uncle is a fan of dessert so after the meal, he ordered a creme brûlée for all of us to share. It was... ok. Something was off when eaten alone, but it was ok if paired with some of the berries on top. 

We sat there for awhile after we finished with dessert and finally we had to ask Jason for the bill because he was not coming around. Everything came up to $140, which isn't bad for the steakhouse that this restaurant was trying so hard to be. 

To be honest, I think if the service was a little nicer, I probably would have enjoyed myself more. But it was what it was, and I was not impressed."}
{"text":"When I first discovered this place way in the back of Station Casino I thought it was the best restaurant in Henderson..Had dinner here many times and never made a reservation.  It didn't seem necessary.  But after a while I began to notice strange things happening.  The most noticeable was the lighting.  I always enjoyed the subtle lighting but someone starting to turn the lights down so far it was practically dark.  They would offer you a flashlight after dimming the lights it was so dark which seemed rather silly.  Not all the waiters had flashlights so if you didn't have your own it was a struggle.  Another strange thing was if you sit at the bar and you said something like \"it's so peaceful here\" the bartender would intentionally make some loud noise.  Maybe he thought he was being funny.  But I didn't.
The ambiance is intimate and you feel like your transported to another era with the decor and arched ceiling.  If you happen to get seated at a small table one side has a chair and the other has a booth seat.  The coffee served in the press is a nice touch.  The restrooms past the bar to the left just for the restaurant are very lovely also.  I don't dine here anymore for these reasons.  If drinks are too much for your wallet just stop at the bar outside the restaurant and play a few hands of video poker first and carry your drink to your table.  I miss going here...but oh well."}
{"text":"I feel like 2 stars is a terrible review, but it is Meh, I've experienced better, and I certainly have had better food at other steakhouses. The ambiance is cute, but it's a little too dark for me. The service is OK. Both times I've been here the waiters are constantly trying to up-sell you. I know, I know, it's their job, but it is such a turn off when they do it incessantly!! Note to manager, please ask your waiters to lay off if customer politely says no! The first time I went ( a LONG time ago), I got the steak. It was good, yes, but very expensive in my opinion. My plate was a slab of meat and a piece of rosemary on my steak. It looked strange to say the least. They do offer complimentary sauces for your meat, but who wants to pay $$$ for steak and drown it in sauce? The second time I went I had the crab legs. VERY LACKLUSTER. We ordered a shrimp appetizer and it wasn't even cooked all the way. The waiter seemed to notice but didn't say anything. Certainly pushy when it came to wanting me to buy a bottle of wine, but not interested when part of my meal is NOT cooked! Usually, steakhouses have good seafood and nice sides. I wasn't impressed. Maybe it's the pushy waiter. I'm sure that was part of it. I used to love love LOVE Sunset Station, and the Mexican place and the Oysters bar, but it seems like the quality has gone down.....waaaaaaaay down."}
{"text":"Awful service!!!! Our servers walked by us many times and didn't even bat an eyelash. Served everyone even if they sat after us.  Apparently someone was more important at the next table because they had servers just standing around and chatting with them.  And while they asked for extra sauce (The waiter even offered to go to the nearby Chinese restaurant to get the sweet and sour sauce) we were still waiting for our meal.  And by the time we got our steaks, they were noticeably dry.  The sides weren't all that.  Not only were they bland, the cream corn was so hot that I burned my mouth and didn't get to fully enjoy my meal.  

Eating at an upscale steakhouse at Sunset Station is already random, but the experience wasn't even worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and me had a unbelievable experience from the hostess Jess to the two bartenders Tony and Tina. The dishes were so delicious, we had Frog Legs, Sliders so yummy, Fried Green Tomatos and Steak Tips. We will definitely be back for more. Oh I can't forget the donuts and coffee so so good."}
{"text":"One of the best! Service is outstanding food is delicious! The banana fosters is to die for ! Drive from Aleinte is with it !  Try the liquid gold desert wine!  Mark O always out does himself with the great hospitality and his crew is above all!"}
{"text":"One of THE BEST STEAKHOUSES off the Strip. Read my whole review because the last part is the \"Cherry on Top.\" Best Service we have ever had. Best meal we have ever had.

My fiancé and I looked for a place that was not exactly hit by the \"glitz and glamour\" of Vegas and wanted a true Steakhouse. Sonoma Cellar hit the spot.We were served by a great lady named Poom. She was very accommodating by going over the menu and recommended some in house favorites that a yelp review can't even try to describe how mouth watering the dishes were...I'm going to try here...

The Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp is a succulent jumbo shrimp wrapped in bacon served with a dijon mustard sauce topped with fried onion strings. Another appetizer we got was the Japanese Shishito Flash Fried Peppers....HOLY MOLY BATMAN! They are mildly spicy and crazy delicious.

Since we came for steak I got the Bone-In Ribeye....medium rare of course. Some places claim to be a steakhouse...SONOMA CELLAR deserves the title of being a bonafide STEAKHOUSE.

My fiancé wanted to try something else besides the steak. They have great choices from Pork T-Bone to Strauss Veal Chop. She went seafood and ordered the Seabass with the Lemon Beurre Blanc sauce and couldn't be more satisfied. The depth of flavor in the beurre blanc sauce coupled nicely with the thickest cut of sea bass filet. This is an award winning dish in my eyes.

Now for the \"Piece de Resistance\" (sounds better in French LOL). They have created a dish you CANNOT GET ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD!!! Do you like Cherry's Jubilee? Well Sonoma Cellar got creative and created the SONOMA JUBILEE. We saved room for dessert and ordered this dish. They come table side to create this dish before your eyes. Blueburries, blackberries and raspberries sautéed in butter, brown sugar and hit with Chambord and Grand Marnier. It suddenly becomes a Vegas Fire Light Spectacular because it turns into a flambé.  During the flambé the server follows it up with cinnamon which becomes even more visually stimulating.

Great ambiance and cozy atmosphere for a date night or out with some friends for drinks and a genuinely wonderful meal."}
{"text":"the steak was great !!! and the brussel sprout salad fantastic BUT the shrimp cocktail was rotten and I mean litteraly spoiled and stinky..."}
{"text":"My husband and I live across the street from Sunset Station and I was an avid lover of this place.  No more.  It's like high school.   You only get bread if you are popular. The same with the service. I dont know what happened after the renovation but trust me I won't be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm. That's it. Steak is on point and cooked to your liking. I'd recommend the Ribeye(house special). Service is very nice and attentive. We're so happy we decided to try it. Who knew a gem like this would be in Sunset Station!"}
{"text":"Best food. Filet was tender.  Great cut.  Lobster was good. Service just not what it could have been. It took him forever to get to come to our table. He never checks on is until meal was finished. Wine glass empty entire time. Bus man was surly."}
{"text":"We went to Sonoma Cellar last night and as usual, it did not disappoint. I've been there about five times now and I love it. 

I had the petite filet done perfectly medium. It melted in my mouth. Probably one of the best filets I've ever had. My husband ordered the porterhouse. It was huge and he enjoyed it. We also ordered the white cheddar and truffle mac and cheese, garlic mashed potatoes and the asparagus grilled in aged balsamic. Everything was PERFECT. 

Our server Israel was unbelievably nice, attentive and very knowledgeable. He recommended our second bottle of wine -- an Argentinian malbec. It was fabulous. 

I'll be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I was very exited to try Sonoma for the first time only to be left in disappointment. Last night I was in a groups of 6 we ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer. It was actually very good, just rather small. Then I order the surf and turf special and my GF orders the top Sirloin. I ordered my food med rare and she orders hers med well. It took 53 minutes from completing our order to having it on the table in front of us. 
After it arrive my steak an lobster were both cool, a littler cooler than room temp as was my GF's steak. 
It is very disappointing to go to a self proclaimed high end steak house and be served food with the quality of Applebee's. I hope this was just a bad experience. As a whole the group was disappointed and I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER LOBSTER!!!!   For the most part, this restaurant is pretty good.   We usually order steaks, or prime rib, and get high quality pieces of meat.   On two different occasions,  we ordered lobster and it was pure GARBAGE . . . .  stringy, spongy, and slimy!   We should have known better after the first experience with it but, after all, a restaurant is entitled to a \"bad night\" once in a while.   With them, this low quality lobster must be the norm!   I've eaten better at Sizzler!"}
{"text":"We go to Sonoma Cellar because it is close.  It is not nearly as good as Anthony's at the M but location wise it is easier. Jason the waiter is phenomenal. Atmosphere is fine, fairly quiet, nice sized booths.  They seem to cater to the gamblers, which we are not.  It is not smoky inside the restaurant but horrible getting in and out of the casino to get to it.  Food is good, not great. Presentation again is good not great.  For a decent steak close to home, we like it. Prices are that of a high end steakhouse."}
{"text":"I have been to five different steakhouses at Station Casinos and I'd rate this as the best of the group to this point.  I was 2 minutes early for my 5:30 reservation, and I was seated in a smaller side room.  I liked that area a lot.  It was quiet and appointed just as nicely as the main room.

My server was David and he and the bus person that worked with him were excellent!  I had some questions about the menu and they were answered correctly.  

For a starter, I got the smoked pork belly with Southern grits, bourbon maple sauce, and rainbow chard.  The grits were simply a small sauce beneath the pieces of pork belly.  A perfect starter for a solo diner.

I ordered the Sonoma Classic for my main course.  The classic is a 20 ounce, bone-in ribeye.  The menu describes it this way--our signature steak, marinated with tomato, garlic, cilantro, and our special blend of spices, served with garlic cilantro sauce.  I ordered it blue and it was not done perfectly--a chef who's not afraid to send a very rare steak out to a customer who ordered it that way!!!!

The side is ordered was Hasselback potatoes--yukon potatoes, bacon, gorgonzola, and chives.  I was expecting potatoes more like au gratin and I was surprised but pleased with the order.  There were two smaller potatoes that appeared to have been boiled and then topped with the cheese, bacon, and chives.  They were very good.

I took David's suggestion for dessert and ordered the peanut butter pie.  The menu describes it as oreo crust, candied peanut, and creamy peanut butter filling.  It was excellent!  Thanks, David.

As I said earlier, service was excellent.  I had a fresh iced tea before I finished my first one.  I liked the room because there was not a TV in sight with some sports channel playing.

I'll be back to Sunset Station to try something else."}
{"text":"Not a fan.
First, I'm not sure why they decide to seat everyone in the side room instead of the main dining area. 
The only thing that was decent were the steaks, which had better be at a steakhouse.  The ribeye house and filet were cooked perfectly, and the garlic cilantro sauce tasted good, I couldn't taste the cilantro which is good because I Hate cilantro.
We had the cauliflower, Hasselbeck potatoes, and elotes. 
The cauliflower was done in 3 ways, a puree, pickled and roasted. The puree was nothing special, it seemed to be there to hold the other pieces in place. The pickled tasted good, but the roasted ones were so bland. It was literally roasted cauliflower, no anything on it.  Kinda sucked. 
The Hasselbeck potatoes I believe are supposed to be spiralized, um, ours you could tell was cut, but it was pretty much a whole gold potato that had some stuff atop it. Disappointing. 
The elotes were good. 
Service - not the best. Started out ok, but I watched as the server went by to the next table, and never stopped to ask how things were at ours. The (what I guess is) assistant Mgr guy stopped by and asked how things were, the husband asked for a side of bernaise, he stopped, looked really confused like he didn't speak English and walked away.  It was kinda funny. 
Long story short, I ended up getting up and getting my own sauce. When I was up there, the server said \"oh, we can bring that back to the table for you\", uh why? I'm already up here, it's a little late for that.  
Hence the 2 stars. I hate bad service I think more than I hate cilantro."}
{"text":"Four of us went to dinner there at the end of April.  We had heard such good reports that we had to try the restaurant.  (We love Hanks at Green Valley so hoped this would be excellent at a lower cost).

First of all, the service was horrid.  It was difficult to get the waiter to return when we asked for a couple more minutes.  Finally he took our order.

My wife and I tend to split dinners since we're trying to watch our calories.  We asked for a medium rare porterhouse and for the kitchen to cut it up for us.  Apparently it's too much trouble for people in the kitchen that have very sharp knives to be bothered so this request was refused.

So bad service.  Strike 1.  Kitchen being jerks.  Strike 2.

The steak was delivered to us well done.  Had to send it back.  Strike 3.  (And still they wouldn't cut it for us.

I see no reason to return there after the remodel.  Problems like this start at the top.  Unless the management changes I don't see how the restaurant can be recommended."}
{"text":"I usually get a filet with traditional sides when we come to this locals steakhouse and they always deliver. However, we had an impromptu dinner one weekday evening when the Oyster Bar had a very long wait. I was craving seafood so I ordered a bowl of shrimp cocktail as a starter and lobster bisque and scallops for my entree...both were excellent! The table shared sides of creamed corn and asparagus both of which were perfectly prepared and delicious. I highly recommend this somewhat less well known steakhouse."}
{"text":"I've tried Sonoma Cellar five times over the years and it has never failed to disappoint me. Last night was my first visit after the new redesign and while the restaurant is drop-dead gorgeous inside in terms of interior design, the food is still just as god-awful as ever. I spent my free players points on dinner here and while it was technically a \"free\" mail, I STILL feel like I got ripped off. 

Our server was professional and prompt (until it came time to pay our bill, more on that later). We were presented with a basket of complimentary bread which included sourdough, wheat, and a really yummy bacon foccaccia style bread. Noone warned us that there was indeed pork in the bread, a big no-no if there's a vegetarian or vegan at your table. 

The new menu looks an awful lot like the old menu, but with a few \"upgrades\": one of them apparently being the quality of the meat. Our waiter gushed about how the kitchen was now using \"fresh produce grown in Nevada\" and \"higher quality beef.\"  

The menu is also misleading. The descriptions sound delicious but they over-promise while the kitchen under-delivers. Here's what we ordered: 

Appetizer to Share: Bacon Wrapped Shrimp, $14 for four decently prepared shrimp wrapped in super crispy bacon and a mustard / orange marmalade sauce. Tasty but overpriced. 

For dinner I got the filet mignon ($34) and asked for it medium well. The kitchen butterflied my steak which is fine, but it was still a little too pink in the middle for me and it was served cold. I didn't send it back because it wasn't that good anyway, but a steakhouse should know how to properly cook a steak without butterflying it and if they have to cut it, it at least shouldn't be closer to rare in the middle (and serving a steak cold -- not room temperature, but COLD) is ridiculous. Hubby got the pan seared ribeye ($39) and said the meat quality was disappointing. Neither of the steaks were well seasoned and my steak tasted like it had zero seasoning on it at all, not even salt or pepper.

The side dishes, each priced at $9, were miniscule portions and tasted bad. We had broccoli that was served with a dab of yogurt on the bottom and a few sad pistachios tossed in (although the menu promised spicy broccoli with mint and yogurt and nuts, we technically got those things but it was unappetizing to look at), and Cauliflower Three Ways (the menu listed it as such, as a trio of cauliflower prepared pickled, pureed, and roasted). We were served a bowl of cold roasted cauliflower. 

The wine list was actually quite good, heavy on the big California reds and the per bottle prices weren't marked up as much as they are at the \"big boy\" gourmet steak houses. A few wines were served by the glass for an average price of $11 per glass. We brought in our own bottle and the corkage fee was $25. 

The service was decent until it was time for our check, and we sat and waited quite a long time. We were trying to catch a movie next door at the Regal and our waiter was aware of that fact. Still, he ignored us for a good 15 minutes before returning with our check. We paid with points but he erroneously took an additional $40 worth of points out of our Players account. He swore he would get a manager to take care of it, but I'm doubtful. I'll check to see what my balance is but I have every idea that he just left that extra $40 on there. 

This is a pretty restaurant but the food is bad, the prices are too high, the quality is poor, and the service needs a lot of work. I won't be back."}
{"text":"2 Bad steaks at one table, side's were Meh."}
{"text":"The service was great. The newly designed steakhouse is gorgeous and the music was cool. The food was good. The lighting was nicely set. Just thought it was slightly over priced. I will return because I m close."}
{"text":"Had dinner 12/05/2015 and it's still the best Steak House in Clark County.  For an evening out or a special occasion you can't find a better place to dine. 
The Chef Britt should have a Michelin Star or three."}
{"text":"What a lovely unexpected surprise! 

From the service, ambiance, to the mouth watering steak, I was really impressed by this steakhouse inside Sunset Station. 

My friend was having her birthday dinner here with her parents and invited me and another one of our girl friends to join. I started off with the shrimp cocktail and went with the bone-in ribeye for my main dish. It was seasoned and cooked perfectly. I asked for medium and it came out the exact shade of pink I like my steak. It was a fattier ribeye than I'm used to, but I ate around the fat. It also came with a delicious buttery and garlicky sauce, which I didn't use. I don't need sauce for my steaks, but the sauce was so good I wish I had something else to dip it in! 

We had a male server and he was excellent. We got a bottle of Cabernet; he was always coming around to pour more wine and my ice water was never empty.

The server brought out a huge slice of carrot cake with candles for my friend's birthday. We passed it around and it was a great ending to our meal! 

Overall, I wasn't expecting this steakhouse to be as good as it was. It's in Henderson which is a bit far from where I live but it's definitely worth the drive. I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Visited this Steakhouse as we received a comp'd dinner as a benefit from being Chairman Status.   
Service was great....sorry, forgot the servers name.  

Food was just okay.  The steakhouse at Green Valley Ranch, Hanks....is by far so much better and the steakhouse at the Palace Station is wonderful as well....this one is just okay."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! Let me just start there!

Sat down and the server stopped by 5 minutes later to tell us that he has another table in front of us that is just taking care of their bill and he would be right back. 10 mins later he returns to tell us there was actually a couple tables that were taking care of their bill.

Food wasn't that great. Sides are super small. Usually we can share a side with our family of four but we had to order 2 of the Mac and cheese and 2 of the broccoli. The mash potato was fine to share amongst us but we only had a scoop each.

Plates for our appetizer, side plates, and even dinner plates were piling up on the table. No one came by to pick them up or even check on us. When we asked the busser for more water he poured the water so fast it got all over the table. 

When it came time to pay the bill, our server took awhile and again said it was because of another party. Not a good feeling to know that you come last to other tables."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to go to Sonoma Cellar.  Ever  since it 1st opened. We finally went for our anniversary!  Funny thing is, INTERESTINgS things happen there. Like our wedding song came on when right after we were seated.  Then after our meal they brought us a happy anniversary cake. Yet, we did not tell anyone it was our anniversary. Except another couple before we were seated. Although, my blackened salmon was very good. It's the little things like this that make it memorable."}
{"text":"Worst 110 bucks I ever spent.  The wife and me went out for Valentines day.  I booked this place on open table a week out only because our first 5 choices were booked.  Its funny because 2 hours before the wife was like \"Hey lets do a movie instead or take the kids to Metro pizza\" I was thinking \"I already booked this seat and I would hate to waste it, plus it would be nice to have a nice steak and relax with out the kids\".  Really should have just went to see a super bad movie and saved the coin ya know.  We started with drinks the wife got a glass of wine and I got a margarita (Did not now til the bill came it was a 20 dollar drink!).  We got the bacon wrapped shrimp.....really good(only positive about this joint).  I ordered the 36 dollar steak.  I have had better steak at Chilis....it was cooked the way I wanted but it had no flavor...I mean wow 36 bucks and I have cooked better steaks on a Foreman grill......so fricking disappointing.  It just really sucks when you get the bill and and you know its gonna be alot and the meal sucks. But that should tell you about Station Casinos.......the 90s they had a quality product, nowadays they just suck."}
{"text":"This won't be pretty but let's get it over with. Someone in the house was craving a good dinner and the steak and lobster tail billboard along the 95 kept catching her attention. So tonight she offered to take us all out for dinner...and hey, I'm not going to say no to that. In hindsight....I kinda wish I had. So with the backstory set...let's just do this one list style. 

The Good: 
Good parking. It's Sunset Station and they've got lots of parking.
Nice lighting and decor. 
Bacon wrapped jumbo shrimp appetizers. Visually they had the wow factor but they didn't taste as good as they looked. 
They put up with a 3 and 6 year old and made accommodations to get them Lobster Mac from the Pasta house next door. 
The Lobster tail was average, but undercooked which is a nice lead in to.....

The Bad & Ugly: 
Don't look up. The vents are nasty. Yes, they make extension handles to get a duster up there. Surely Station Casinos can afford an extension handle and someone to use it every once in a while. 
The bacon wrapped jumbo shrimp while good had bacon that was almost burned. There's a fine line between extra crispy and just flat out burned and they flirted with it....hard. 
It's a Double Tall Grey Goose with Cranberry please. Not a single and that cranberry juice was definitely not fresh. Listen to the pretty woman giving you her order and get it right please. 
Was that Caesar Salad or wilted soggy salad?
I was not in the mood to have my steak moo at me tonight so I asked for medium well. I did not say make it taste like charcoal. They burned my steak. Was this amateur chef night on the grill? I'm thinking it was. 
Slow service. For Pete's sake at this price point you can't refill water or other beverages on the table? And why in the world did it take so long to take our order and get our food? Oh wait, it was amateur night in the kitchen, and after trying to make it right someone must have said screw this, just get it to 160 degrees and send the dang thing out. That's gotta be the explanation. 

I was not with my normal group of people so I stayed calm and quiet, didn't send the steak back, didn't complain, and our group left a good tip...but it was not easy. 

At this price point I expect a certain basic level of performance. I left disappointed, so much so that I saw a guy looking at the menu at the door on my way out and I told him you really don't want to do this. He walked away...kinda wish I had too. 

3 Stars...I was going to rate it a 2 but they took care of our kids without attitude and that gets a star on it's own.

If they could fix a few things I would like to go back and give them another try because I have to admit problems or not I wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"We started off with a breadbasket and shared a very good Caesar salad. This restaurant, like most of the Station Casino steakhouses, currently offers a $14.99 prime rib special that, in this case, included garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli.  Our animal protein, weighing is at close to a pound, was cooked medium rare as requested, but the quality was somewhat south of prime.  Justin, our server, was light-hearted while maintaining a professional level of competence.  Overall the meal was satisfying and represented a good value."}
{"text":"This is the first time we have been back since the renovation. We stopped for happy hour. The food was terrific and the live music was an unexpected treat. Service was friendly and efficient. I wasnt sure what to expect from the renovation but was pleasantly surprised to find it not only pretty but comfortable."}
{"text":"The service was stellar and the ambiance was impeccable. However; I must have ordered all the wrong things because from what I am reading, I completely missed out. I ordered the chicken, and it was tough, the breading was thick and over-fried. The center of my twice baked potato was cold, we had waited long enough for our order that I did not send it back. The asparagus was soft as though it had been forgotten in the steamer. 
Regardless, the service was excellent and I know we will eat there again, I will just order something different."}
{"text":"Decided to try Sonoma Cellar as I had a $25.00 discount coupon. Over priced for the quality or should i say lack of quality. The sea bass was an excellent size and the taste would have been great except everything we ordered was too salty. This included the lobster tail and all side dishes. Does the chef own a salt mine ? The young lady asked if we had reservation. With the place nearly empty at 6PM on a Saturday who needs reservations ? I asked for a booth but was directed to a table. For $10.00 I'm sure I could have secured the table of my choice. if you are visiting from East No Where, AK . and think Applebees or Outback are great restaurants you'll love this place. My favorite restaurant here in Las Vegas is THE PALM in Caesars Place. You will pay twice as much but the food is 3 times better."}
{"text":"I consider Sonoma Cellar a \"bargain\" because its food can stand up to great steakhouses, but the prices don't.  I'm not saying it's the equivalent of Cut or Carnevino, because it's not, but Sonoma is excellent.

To start, we usually get the crabcakes and tomato soup.  With the soup, you get a nice little grilled cheese sandwich that I would be fine ordering for a meal at other places.  The crabcakes are large and full of crab meat, not as much filler as you see elsewhere.  Shrimp cocktail is also a winner, large and the sauce has good horseradish flavor.

The steaks are excellent, and we've not had an issue with cooking temperature.  We usually get a steamed lobster, which is standard.  It's cooked well and served with drawn butter.  No complaints here, but it's also not anywhere near the best lobster we've had.

Once, we took friends from Dallas, and one of them ordered the pork T-bone.  This was fantastic, but I won't ever be able to not order the ribeye.

Last time we dined here, we had a group of 6.  The server gave us tasters of bottles of wine before we ordered them.  We ended up ordering quite a bit of wine, so clearly the strategy worked, but it was a nice touch.  The service is always fantastic.  It's an excellent experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We eat dinner here all the time. Their steaks can't be beat. Try the brick chicken it is so moist. Decent wine menu (limited) or happy hour sliders in the lounge are just enough sometimes"}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse. Service was very good. The food was excellent. I had the ribeye naked with baked yam. It was a dining experience you should try whenever you come the Sunset Station in Henderson. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"It was a concert night and they were busy...no big deal.  Hostess couldn't locate a wine list then forgot to get one. I had to go looking for her. Waiter was fine. Food, well, salad was mostly greens, and didn't include the described ingredients. Soup, lobster bisque was no doubt canned soup, petite filet was very nice size and cooked to order but side sauce was maybe 2 tablespoons. Yukon mashed potatoes were very dry. Won't spend the steakhouse prices for this place again.

Post review:
Received a response from the restaurant asking for specifics on the food, but they are not allowing me to respond.  I think the review speaks for itself however."}
{"text":"Went for a business dinner and was able to sample many of the side dishes.

The atmosphere is nice. Great for a romantic dinner but not too over the top that you can't go for a business meeting.

The servers are top notch, attentive,  very knowledgeable of the menu and ready with suggestions.

I had the Rib Eye and the special lobster chowder, both were wonderful.  Also sampled the potatoes au gratin (sinful), the garlic mashed potatoes (I like homestyle mashed potatoes and these definitely fit the bill), grilled asparagus (delicious, especially with hollandaise), and steamed spinach.  

The bacon wrapped shrimp was perfectly executed, crisp bacon and tender succulent shrimp.

For dessert the table split the NY cheesecake, caramel cheesecake, ice cream and chocolate brownie, and creme brulee.  

My only complaint was that I ordered my steak rare and was given a medium steak.  Apparently they gave mine to one of my dining partners (sort of understandable since 5 of us ordered the rib eye, but in a restaurant of this caliber, you'd think they'd be able to keep the orders straight).

For a special occassion meal, I would definitely recommend Sonoma Cellar. (I heard that they are bringing back the three course menu, so it may be sooner that I get to go back."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and service was just right for a high-tier restaurant. Steaks were cooked to order perfectly but one was kinda grizzelly. Lobster was delicious. The creamed corn is perfect and to die for. A little pricey for a steakhouse, but definately a recommend for a fine dinner party or a small private business meeting. Nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner here tonight and amazing staff! Edward and Poom were very hospitable. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I am so full and so exhausted, but I was still determined to write this review tonight. After careful consideration of everything that has happened in the last few months regarding my experience at Sonoma Cellar, I am happy to say that they have definitely redeemed themselves and earned five stars, if not six!

The manager, Aaron finally contacted me and discussed the issues that I had. He apologized for what happened and for his behavior throughout, and while he and I initially bumped heads, he was very humble and he owned the outcome of the situation. I can definitely respect that. I made it clear that I would have happily changed my review a long time ago, had he acknowledged me and apologized for what happened. I honestly don't think that that even crossed his mind, which I understand because so many people do not go back and update their reviews. I am a fair person and I'm not hard to please, so I really appreciated him reaching out. Initially, when he called me, I was mad that he was calling, but I did listen to him and he sounded very sincere and invited me back to show me how great Sonoma Cellar is meant to be. Many people don't stand up and own their shit and while it took awhile, the fact that he did speaks volumes. 

From the time we walked in, we received impeccable service. Aaron greeted our party of four (My mom, sister, her fiancé, and myself) and sat us at a very comfortable booth that was already set up for us. The table was beautiful and he had a very nice and thoughtful card waiting there for me. He also brought over glasses of champagne for us!! Talk about service! I'm glad that he set it up for Javier to be our server, again. He was absolutely fantastic, as usual. We ordered wine and chatted over the menu. Aaron came over and suggested the Bone Marrow appetizer and gave a funny explanation of It. We ordered that and the Crab Dip. Both were excellent! My sister ordered the Lobster Bisque, of which she said it was the best she'd ever had. Compliments to Chef Brit! He also came out and briefly chatted with us. 

We ordered our steaks and lobsters that were cooked to perfection, as usual! Major compliments to the kitchen! All of the sides were delicious...asparagus, mashed potatoes, spinach, broccoli, macaroni and cheese, and sweet potatoes. We got our desserts to go, so we could enjoy them in our rooms in front of the TV!

In all, the experience tonight was the best that I've ever had at a steakhouse and I have been to some pretty ritzy places. We were made to feel like we were the only ones in the room. We have never been rushed to eat at Sonoma. This is a place where you could literally dine, not eat. It reminded me of Europe, where they don't eat, they dine. You take your time and enjoy your food. The service was amazing, especially from Aaron. He made it a point to check on us regularly and chat with us. He was very friendly and lighthearted and I was happy to see this side of him. Let me say this...His reaching out to me was not easy, by far. I know that. But he certainly made up for everything and I can definitely forgive and move on. We will definitely be back...maybe for my birthday in a few weeks!"}
{"text":"The service was awful! We waited an hour for our food. There was never any explanation or apology from our waitress. We had to flag down a bus boy just to get a refill on our iced teas. When the food did arrive there was still no explanation to why we had to wait so long. We saw our waitress three times all night; when we ordered, when she brought the food, and when she brought the check. I would have given the restaurant 1 star but the food was very good (although not worth the wait)."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here yesterday for Valentines day and it was amazing! The restaurant was so pretty and romantic. Great ambiance. Poom was our server and she was incredible. Very attentive and so nice. All of the staff around was so sweet. The manager was going around making sure everyone was enjoying their meals. The steaks were AMAZING. Cooked to perfection. The creme brulee was also incredible. I wasn't TOOO impressed with the sides though. I feel like they could've been better. I had the garlic mashed potatoes and we shared the mac and cheese. I would've liked more garlic to the mashed potatoes but that's just me. The mac was just ok. This won't stop me from returning!"}
{"text":"This was the best meal in Vegas.Steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Lobster was a decent size...not super small as I usually get with surf and turf combos.  Side of creamed corn and gratenne potatoes were ample to share for 2-3 people. Wonderful meal and waiter."}
{"text":"Used to be a staple place for us, not anymore. The remodel has ruined what this place was. They shrank the portion sizes to the point it was laughable when our steaks arrived and the lobster tails could have been mistaken for crawdad tails lol.

They of course raised the prices on everything after they cut the portions and also removed most of the best menu items. They have clearly forgotten they are located in sunset station.

The room is unbelievably ugly, it's like a cheap knock off of hanks at gvr. 

I have zero issue forking up some cash for a fantastic meal but this has turned into a rip off.
 go to Michaels @ south point if you want a great meal"}
{"text":"Diane and I spent New Year's Eve with friends here for a 2-3/4 hour meal.  Once again Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp and a Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail were stellar starters.  A bowl of cheesy Onion Soup Gratinee was excellent, and a Steakhouse Salad very good.  However, a bowl of Lobster Bisque was good but cold, and all sauce had cooked out of the Lobster Thermidor prong of that evening's special Surf & Turf by the time it reached the table.  The 7 oz. Filet accompanying it was medium rare as ordered, and delicious with both Bearnaise Sauce and Shitake Mushroom & Red Wine Demi-Glace Sauce.  And a very large, single slice of decadent 7-Layer Chocolate Cake easily satisfied all four of us, enhanced further by 2 scoops of Vanilla Ice Cream.

Service was good when it was rendered.  But our server initially only took orders for soup and salad, and did not seek further ordering for another 20 minutes.   My Baked Potato arrived late, and at first lacked requested bacon bits.  

Overall, we still all greatly enjoyed our meal, but the dining encounter did not rise to a 5-star experience this time around."}
{"text":"Sonoma is a great looking restaurant with a nice, comfy bar area. A recent happy hour visit at the bar was overall a success. Two of us shared the mushroom sliders, happy hour BBQ shrimp and crab dip. We both liked the sliders, tho I'm not confident the mushrooms were there, as I didn't taste any. This appetizer comes with fries and homemade ketchup, and we got the ketchup after the sliders. The fries were good, and the shrimp was pretty good also. The BBQ part of the shrimp was not in your face, which I had mixed feelings about. As for the crab dip, it was fine but needs some spice. 

Drinks are above average, and my whiskey cocktail, Cellar Style, was pretty memorable. It has Merlot, rye whiskey, brown sugar, cinnamon syrup and black walnut bitters. Happy hour drink prices are fair for an upscale steakhouse, and they have a good beer selection also. 
We also got a crab salad compliments of the chef, which was a nice touch, and we both enjoyed it. Service was great, and we agreed that we'd return to enjoy the food and bar ambiance."}
{"text":"What a complete opposite experience from Hanks. We went Tuesday night for Restaurant Week, they had a set 3 course dinner for $40. When we arrived it was almost completely empty so we were sat quickly. 

We waited for our server who showed up and took our drink orders. He was going over some of the high priced items and we told him we wanted the restaurant week menu. He said \"Oh hold on, I have to check on that\". He returned and told us they didn't have it available. Huh? Its only Tuesday and RW runs through Friday. Our server told us they ran out of the NY steak. Really, you ran out of steak at a steakhouse? 

I asked if they could substitute the NY steak and he said he had to ask the chef. Again he came back and said they called the \"head chef\" and he would come talk to us. We waited and waited and no one showed up. I finally got up and asked the hostess to send the manager over. She told me there was not a manager there tonight. In all of Sunset station there was no restaurant or F&B manager? No wonder this place was empty, service was deplorable. 

The hostess found a beverage manager and I explained to her we came for the RW menu and it was not available. I told her they would not sub the steak and apparently the chef was called who never bothered to show up and we wanted to leave. She was kind enough to comp my glass of wine which I had about 2 sips of and we left, never to return again. 

Sonoma, you need to take a lesson from Hanks. Great customer service will bring your customers back."}
{"text":"Wow what a fabulous dinner. David was our server and we came back twice to see him. Had the seafood platter to start and  surf and turf for dinner  with a fabulous bottle of Rodney strong. The Berry Jubilee for dessert. All around as a date we had fun and then with a group of 6 it was just as good. So pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I took my mother here for her birthday. We both got the Surf and Turf.  The steak and lobster were great! But, we also ordered blue cheese martinis, the olives were kind of grey and shriveled which told me they were the kind from the store in a jar and quite small just like them, $13 was too much that should have been a $6 drink.  Do at the end we decided to get a slice of cheesecake with strawberries.  We each took one bite and wanted to spit it out. It tasted stale and hard.  I did send it back since it was fortune for one slice. The waiter was sort of argumentative when I told him we would like to pass on it and asked why, he then said it was hard because it was refrigerated, um no it's old and tastes terrible.  He told me they are known for their cheesecake and that may be the case but that night it was plain bad."}
