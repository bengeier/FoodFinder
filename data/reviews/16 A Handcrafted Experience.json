{"text":"Amazing cocktail lounge! It's about time the M put this beautiful space to use and open it to the public. The view is incredible! Of course it's a little pricy, but they are craft cocktails. Service was stellar and the view was incredible! There's also an amazing selection of small plates - from grilled wagyu to hamachi, one of the best selections I've seen in an upscale lounge. This place is awesome and I wish them much success!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect when we got off the elevator at 16- for sure a great view, and hopefully great food too. Let me say that the experience was beyond great, added to the view and food was outstanding service from the hostess, to the manager to the chef. We were a party of 3 and enjoyed cocktails, a great sampling of the menu: Brazilian bread, a fried trio of yummy-ness, butter poached halibut(my favorite), braised short rib, and the ramen soup (whew!) and then(cause it's Vegas) we added dessert to the mix too. We will definitely be back, if just to try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Good relaxing atmosphere and food was really good, BUT...prices were just too high for this type of place.   Would love to go here with my wife to Hang out and have drinks and all, but I just cannot justify the prices they charge.   It just is not worth it.   Hoping they make some changes, cause we'd love to do this place more often."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place! Incredible view! Incredible hotel! This place forgets it's still a place for locals. They didn't have Kettle one Vodka. The food and drinks are ridiculously over priced. The food selection is way off point. They should have sliders and salads and instead they have a pathetic charcuterie board with meats I could make better from seven eleven. The short ribs were ok but 2 bites for $18 and they were just ok. Also got the fried sampler. Not very good and the banana chocolate sticks for dessert. Sadly we will not go back but so disappointed they can't get the space up top right because if they did it would be a gold mine ."}
{"text":"Fantastic wine and cocktail selection, beautiful views and nice staff. Having a brunch special on the weekends or live jazz on the patio at night would be awesome.   This place is the start of something that could be fantastic. The staff needs a bit of polishing and maybe some elevated uniforms that add to the chic, mid century aesthetic. The staff as well as their uniforms set the mood of how casual or formal the bar should be. An elevated dress code may attract a more energetic crowd as well. I could definitely see this place being a mini \"Boom Boom Room\" from The Standard New York Hotel. I will be back.  Favorite wine was the Cabernet Sauvignon -Educated Guess, Napa Valley."}
{"text":"My husband discovered this lounge while searching for information about places for us to have date night. We are frequent visitors at the M resort and it's always nice to find another place to hang out that's local. The menu and ambience at this lounge is super enjoyable. The menus are shaped like a little books and there are many handcrafted cocktails, wines, small bites for you to enjoy while hanging out with peeps.  For drinks, we tried some of their handcrafted cocktails for our first round and then moved onto red wine after that. I tried the savory tonic which was an amazing mixture of elder berry tonic water along with St. Germain liquor. It was very refreshing and lightly sweet on the palate. My husband had their old-fashioned which tasted like it was made with love instead of the usual syrups and bar feel.   My only drawback on this lounge is the food. It tastes amazing, but The prices are a little steep. I understand the pricing for drinks at any casino resort, but the pricing for extremely small portions of food to cost anywhere between $14 to upwards of $25 is a little much. Being that this is a newer lounge, I think that there is room for improvement on the availability of food and pricing of the menu. If it is going to be more of a lounge feel, there should be more small bites that cater to everyone's pallet that are reasonably priced below $15. For example, we had their scallops that were to die for, but we only got to scallops for $19 which is crazy to me!   This review will probably have to be updated because we plan to come back and try things out at 16 again. I definitely like the vibe, the field, the drinks, so I'll look to see some improvement on the Ninnu before actually eating here again."}
