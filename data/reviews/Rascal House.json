{"text":"Terrible experience.  We placed an online order for delivery and the estimated delivery time was 45 minutes. After an hour and twenty minutes I called the store we ordered from to get a status update and they ensured me that the order had left and was on the way.  After two hours the pizza still had not arrived. I called them again and the guy I spoke to was nice and apologetic, unfortunately he wasn't the manager as I think things would've been handled properly with him.  The manager, Robin, told me that they never received the order. I asked her why then, during my first call, did someone tell me the order was on the way. She had no explanation and claimed that I must've called another store - I didn't, I called the same number. It was also her assertion that I probably ordered from a different store, but would do me the favor of checking their computer to verify this. She said she would call me back in 15 minutes.  Fifteen minutes later, she called back and confirmed that the order was indeed in their system and I finally received an apology. She reviewed the order I placed, including the tip and total. I asked her if I was getting a refund and she told me that I wouldn't get the pizza if she gave me a refund.  Since I wasn't about to pay full price to get a pizza delivered in three hours, I told her to forget it and take the charge off my card.  Last time we order from there."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to be invited to The Rascal House's \"Tasting Party\" today, to sample their new \"Spicy Chicken Bleu Trio\" Menu items! I have always loved The Rascal House's Pizza (which I think is the best in the city of Cleveland) and their  sandwich platters very delicious as well! Also, The Rascal House's food presentation is absolutely stunning!   My favorite Spicy Chicken Bleu Trio item is the Sandwich Wrap! It isn't quite as spicy as the rest of the new menu items. Perhaps, the wonderful wrap bread cools the spice down just a bit. The flavors are wonderful, the wrap bread is delicious--and it is the perfect compliment to the spicy chicken and delectable Bleu Cheese!  My second favorite food item is is the Spicy Chicken Bleu Cheese Sandwich. The crunch of the tasty chicken and the flavor of red onion adds a delicious flavor enhancement, which made my soul happy! Also, the red onion compliments the Bleu Cheese, and adds a wonderful zest.  The Spicy Chicken Bleu Pizza is good, and the spice is over-the-top! Spicy food lovers will enjoy it.  I love the ambience of this restaurant, because it takes me back to my college days--since it is located in the heart of downtown Cleveland--directly across the street from Cleveland State University's Campus, and steps away from the beautiful PlayHouse Square District.  Additionally, I love the staff here! They are all so very friendly! Parking is free during the weekdays, for an hour, if you can find a parking spot on the street out front. And The Rascal House offers free WiFi to their guests."}
{"text":"I've only had Rascal House Pizza maybe three or four times since I moved to Cleveland nearly 15 years ago, and I've never had an awful experience. I genuinely like their white pizza, which we've ordered a couple times for lunch in the past two weeks. Each time the pizza tasted different. One more garlicy than the other, but still delicioso. The delivery time was pretty decent, especially since we ordered during the major lunch rush."}
{"text":"Well we ordered our food and half our order came. She took our cash first and then she responded with, \"shoot, I'll be right back.\" Because an item was missing. 20-30 minutes later we called the store. Answer: \"Whether she was planning to or not she will with the chicken.\" ... Whether she was planning to? Okay, well that's not right. And they offered no discount or other compensation. Not great service. But to be fair the pizza was decent Can't tell you how the chicken is, haven't been able to try it. Just wait to pay until you have your order."}
{"text":"I can't front as I have been here more than a few times....pizza by the slice is good (convenient) and you can get wings if you have an unhealthy relationship with wings (nowhere else to go in University Circle afaik). It just has nothing special going on. Customer service is bad but it follows the laws of University Circle (thou shalt hate your customers)."}
{"text":"People behind the counter was friendly.  They need to cook their pizza dough more...not done in the center.  They need to learn how to cut things more evenly.....not all pieces are the same.  Some big and some small."}
{"text":"Took over an hour and a half to get a mediocre, $19 medium pizza that was cold when it arrived. First and last time ordering from this place."}
{"text":"Made an order over the phone and the person who made my order (Christian) confirmed to me that my order would be delivered within 30-40 minutes. I waited over an hour and never received my order. I made a call back to Rascal House to see what was going on and apparently they never even took my order down. They even recognized that Christian had spoke to me but never took my order. I never got an apology and they completely dismissed the situation. This place is highly unprofessional. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"I mean, when it's past midnight and you live in downtown Cleveland, who else are you gonna call for food delivery?  Besides the B- level pizzas which will do at 1AM, My favorites are the hot wings, cheeseburger, and wraps  Cookies are unbearably dry  Fries sometimes have the freezer taste"}
{"text":"After searching for a pizza place around downtown Cleveland on Memorial day weekend, Rascal's was the only place open. I was leary after reading all of the negetive reviews, but to my surprise the food was good.   The crust on our pizza was crunchy and the garlic bread portion was larger than expected.  The delivery time was quicker than expected as well.   A good mid level pizza, I would rate it as a step above Dominoe's, Pizza Hut and the like. So if the kids want pizza this is a good choice!"}
{"text":"Yeah so, the pizza is--on a scale of 1 to 10 ONLY IN NEW YORK city, not CLEVELAND, where do you fall? You fall out of bounds... Get this stuff out here. Another joint that serves oooooogots! if you live in Cleveland and are born in Cleveland and never had pizza in New Jersey or New York and you like this pizza here. No reason to go on. Enjoy===oooooogots! Over priced like all the other crap pizza here in C- town=Cleveland."}
{"text":"Prompt service to the hotel tasteless white pizza, greasy.  Lesson learned go out to dinner don't be lazy sitting in the hotel"}
{"text":"Rascal House should give out toilet paper instead of napkins. I understand this place is for the sobriety-challenged twenty somethings, but c'mon. Two topping pizza the other night was just this side of criminal. I would have happily returned to ask for money back but-for being hand cuffed to my kohler for several hours immediately following consumption. If you're desperate, maybe. If your stoned, absolutely. If you value your digestive system, no way no how."}
{"text":"i was never a fan of rascal house's original pizza, but the past few fridays at work we've ordered their white pizza.  i have to say, my opinion of rascal house pizza has changed.  the white pizza is yummy.  i had two of my co-worker's mild wings last week too, and they weren't bad.    but i'll stick to my white pizza.  great garlic goodness all over the place."}
{"text":"I had always passed by Rascal house near CSU and never tried it because it looked like a typical college pizza place.   Finally, I had a chance to eat their take out pizza and turns out it is a typical college student favorite cheap pizza place with lots of coupons!   That doesn't mean it is a bad place or the food is not great. A place like this is caters to college students who have no time to cook between their hangovers and dinner dates! I have ate at places like this in my college days and suffice to say that was never about the pizza but who you shared it with!"}
{"text":"For starters, there aren't tons of pizza options downtown. That said, it's not bad pizza. However, it's not great either. Pricier than pizza in the neighborhood but, I wouldn't call it price gouging either. They have some real issues taking the orders and getting addresses. We all know that buildings downtown are like mazes sometimes and the girl taking the order insisted on ONLY taking an address.(no other instructions) This made it VERY hard for the delivery guy. Of course he had to call because she gave him the wrong address all together. I had to send someone to flag him down outside on the street. So, feeling bad for him I tipped him pretty good so now I have over $40 dollars in pizza. And for $40 bucks am I wrong to demand a little more sauce?!?!?! They'd never make it in my neighborhood. But, downtown they have a market."}
{"text":"Rascal House stays open for delivery long after other pizza spots close. Between the times open for delivery and the great tasting pizza, Rascal House is a must after cavs games when it's late and you are in the hotel starving. Give Rascal House a try."}
{"text":"Deluxe pizza slice and a milkshake as a treat for lunch? Yes, ma'am. Quality is consistent, always hot, and the coupon book is awesome!"}
{"text":"We were in town visiting. Staying at the Hampton Inn on ninth. We ordered pizza it came very quickly the pizza was thin crust and delicious, can't complain."}
{"text":"The pizza certainly hit the spot for a late night snack.  I appreciated the delivery to our hotel room. The pizza sauce is a little sweeter than I would like but I enjoyed the light crunch of the crust. Definitely absorbed tonight's alcohol consumption."}
{"text":"1st time here.  Got chocolate oreo milkshake and 6 boneless wings, mild bbq with ranch.  Total was $11 something.   Shake is nothing special and very sugary. Consistency is abt like steak n shake ones.  If i lived in the area,  i would not get again.   Wings cooked right.  Actually got 7 instead of 6. They took forever to come out though and they were dead. Mild bbq ... don't expect sweet bbq. They still have a lil kick (a lil sting on lips) kind of thing.   Really cool vibe place and lots of varieties,  but not really impressed or wowed either."}
{"text":"Just stopped by since I recently went to the other rascal house in university circle. This location is so much better. However, it is a bit different.. .  Their bathrooms are located way in the back outside of their establishment.. .but besides this, food quality and the set prices are great. Affordable for college students and tastes yummy! Interior design is similar in all locations, but I enjoy the seating options at this place. Where booths are places, seats by windows, normal tables and a bar table."}
{"text":"Finally found a lunch spot around here that is really clean and pleasant. $5 for two big pizza slices and a drink."}
{"text":"Rascal House is open late, which is its primary draw. The cheese steak sandwich was a bit greasy, with no veggies (just some decent beef, mushrooms, and cheese). The bread was thin and crunchy, not soft.  The wings were actually pretty good. I didn't try the pizza, but it looked very run-of-the-mill and the kind of fare that only sounds good after a night of partying."}
{"text":"Please have staff change gloves when collecting money AND handling food. Pizza was good but the salad had very little chicken on it. I might try them again... Maybe"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I love rascal house pizza. I frequent the downtown location more than this Euclid location. I am so disappointed by my experience at this location. Having a diary allergy, I order my pizzas with no cheese. No cheese means no cheese, in the food service industry if something saying no cheese, you don't add any kind of cheese, whether it is it's own topping or not. So I order a veggie pizza with no cheese. When the pizza arrives it has feta CHEESE on it. So I call and explain that my order was wrong. The manager gets on the phone and then proceeds to tell me that feta is \"it's own topping\" and that I can not get a new one or even a refund. I was absolutely dumbfounded that they refused to compensate me for THEIR error in any way."}
{"text":"15 dollars for a large pizza that was mediocre at best. 15 bucks. Nuff said..."}
{"text":"My lord the pizza was horrendous!! What they call garlic bread was like eating a sponge full of rascal urine! Folks, if you like this place then you need to be checked."}
{"text":"I love the House Deluxe Pizza. I only visit Cleveland and always get Rascal House when i do. They are prompt, friendly and have a great product."}
{"text":"Very reasonable and good food. The girl at the counter was very patient with 3 little girls trying to order."}
{"text":"Where do I start. Came to Cleveland for the first time to watch the Cavs vs. warriors game as we just moved to Columbus from California. We stayed at the Hilton Cleveland downtown hotel. We were told our order would take 45 min.... 1 hour and 45 min later our food arrives... cold. To top it off they forgot our cheesecake dessert. Called and they said they would bring it back as we paid cash and couldn't give us a credit. Look I understand if you are busy but don't fib about the expected arrival time just be honest and for goodness sake don't forget an item. The food itself was gross, spend your money elsewhere.  Niko, I understand that pizza places can be busy. My issue is I called another place before yours and they said 1.5-2 hours for delivery at least they were honest. Also, just a tip if you are running that behind give your customer a call and let them know so they're not waiting around. I had to call in and see where our order was and the guy didn't even know!!! I don't give second chances first impression is everything when it comes to food. If the food was good it might be different. I gave 2 stars because another driver came back with the cheesecake otherwise it would have been 1. Good luck!"}
{"text":"We ordered 10 pizzas at midnight and they arrived within the time quoted.  In addition the pizza was HOT and delicious!  Thank you!  Excellent!"}
{"text":"I thought the wings and garlic bread were very  good. Very traditional New York style. My husband wasn't super impressed with the flavor of the pizza, he had meat lovers. It was also on the expensive side for pizza and the online ordering was really poor and kept malfunctioning."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on the recommendation and hype from the previous resident of my current home in University Heights. The pizza wasn't bad by any means, but I found it to be overpriced and on the small side. The crust was a little too light and airy, and the sauce wasn't very flavorful, which made me feel even more that I was paying for more than I was getting back.  With other cheaper options in the area, I probably wouldn't try this place again. I wouldn't mind paying a premium if the pizza blew my mind or even just tasted so-so but was gigantic, but with small portions and so-so flavor, I can't justify the price at all for Rascal House."}
{"text":"It's okay pizza. It has a great location next to campus. Pizza by the slice is $2. You really can't beat that for a quick hot lunch."}
{"text":"Of all the franchise chain pizza shops, this is my go to. That said, this location is not. It's the service. Whether it's going in for a slice and the pizza is cold and the staff can't be bothered to put in a fresh while you wait, or getting ignored at the counter, etc etc... there is just a high probability of being disappointed  I've encountered the owner a time or two (I assume based on the care received on those instances), but weary of taking my chances. Need to change the people, or change the people."}
{"text":"Slow AF!!! Dropped in to get a pizza and run back to work with it. I was told it would take about 15 minutes. After twenty I go to the counter to check on my order. Obviously somebody F'ed up and nobody had even begun to make my pie. They said it was \" in the oven\" All said and done I got my pizza with just enough time ( an hour after placing my order) to get back to work and eat my pizza while I work. No attempt to make reparations on their screw up. Learned my lesson. the pizza was meh."}
{"text":"For several years, I've placed big orders for my students during finals week.  Pizza is darn good--wings are DARN GOOD.  (Maybe awesome.  Yeah.)  It's not different and unique--it is just excellent in the quick and good category.  What keeps me from giving five stars?  I signed up so that I could order online (big orders!) and whenever I tried to check out, I was forbidden--\"phone number required.\"  I had listed a phone number, and went back to double-check--but wasn't allowed to get to the profile screen to fix anything that needs fixing.  I wanted to use my online ordering discount, but ended up having to phone my orders in.  The person I talked to did her best to help me and could not.  She gave me the number for Corporate, which I called.  I described the problem and was told I'd be called back--I wasn't (at least my phone shows nothing.)  That said, my situation was unusual and when my order was delivered, \"Skinny Santa\" in full regalia came along and distributed coupons to my students and to me--a discount for the future.  Overall, I recommend this Rascal House and plan to order from it in the future--and to try whatever is on the menu.  (Did I mention how good the wings are?  DARN GOOD!!)"}
{"text":"Sign says breakfast. All the lights are on. People in there and yet not open. Breakfast 7-1030 on the sign. It's 830 and they are not open. I added picture of sign"}
{"text":"Terrible! Took my money and didn't deliver what I ordered. Fraudulent pizza company! Don't pay till you check your order."}
{"text":"Some good, some not so good. Coworker and I placed an order for lunch. We asked that the order be delivered at 12:30 which was when our lunch started. Instead it arrived at 12. That means it had to sit for half an hour before we could eat it. So we had to reheat. Some people might not mind food coming earlier, but , when you're not allowed to touch it until 1230 and it comes at 12, well, you see my issue. So, after we reheated the cold pizza and potatoes, it was pretty good. Fries rarely re heat well and these were no exception. Pizza was ok.  I would've like to have tried it fresh . I also got the veggie wrap. It was good, but messy, and also the stem was left on my banana pepper, and I didnt notice said and I gagged on it. Could have done without the stem guys. All in all, I probably won't order again."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and fries.  This was my first time at rascal house.  I am a pizza snob.  Loved my pizza!!!"}
{"text":"This is our second run in with Rascals while staying in Cleveland for the night. The best part is the will happily deliver to your hotel, you can order online and they are open NICE and late. So, after your concert, ballgame or gambling affair -- calls rascals and enjoy the pizza sober or as a late night sloppy snack.  Friendly and happy phone service, not annoyed and put off. Busy nights call for a bit of a wait on the delivery, but a 4am call means that they are loved and willing to stay open late to serve their pizza.   Radisson or Hilton Garden Inn, order that shit.  Num. Num. Num."}
{"text":"The pizza was not great didn't have much flavor but the buffalo wings were a hit. Ju At the right amount of heat"}
{"text":"Delivery was faster than projected. Pizza was really good. Cheese was delicious. I was very surprised and satisfied."}
{"text":"For some reason the east side of Cleveland is a pizza delivery desert.  (I can think of some reasons why). These guys deliver.  Pizza dough is very dense.  Wings were actually very good."}
{"text":"Pizza came hot and they delivered it to our room! Generous withy the sauce and cheese great late night eat!"}
{"text":"Reliable delivery and they put feta on their deluxe pizza.  We ordered religiously when I worked downtown. Very decent pizza and convenient location for downtown delivery."}
{"text":"I wanted delivery and didnt want to pay the outrageous fees from my normal pizza place so i decided to try somewhere new. Driving by this place almost every day i figured lets give them a shot...Here is my order run down. BBQ Boneless wings: 1 star... The chicken was ok, unfortunately they were covered in a bottle of bbq sauce that wasn't very good. It was overly tangy and had no sweetness to it. also they could of cut the amount of sauce in half and it still would of been too much. Meatball sub. Again a failure to execute a simple sandwich. The cut out the center of the roll and use it has a dish i guess. weird way to make a sub but ok.. The bread was not baked at all and very soggy. The cheese was barely melted, you could tell that either the oven wasnt on or they put it in for 30 seconds and that was it.. The meatballs were average, i want to say they were store bought but not 100% sure. Waffle fries: these were the only good thing i had. Crispy crust and soft inside. Wish they had better food as the delivery was cheap, but probably will never order from here again..."}
{"text":"Nice casual carry out or eat in by the slice.  It is fun location at CSU campus"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff...my daughter and I ate here for the first time a couple of weeks ago and the pizza and wings were outstanding! We will definitely be eating here, again, in the near future."}
{"text":"Always order the same thing on main \"Boneless Wings\". Did our usual order \"boneless wings with honey mustard\"   Had it delivered. Sat at our dining table, ready to enjoy as we usual do. Open our box and see regular wings. Call the restaurant. Husband told the guy his name and that he just ordered and received our order. Told the guy on the phone we ordered boneless wings with honey mustard. Guy on other line says \"yeah, I took your order. You never said boneless wings\" I can understand if he didn't hear it but to say \"you never said\". Come on! Get better customer service. A simple apology would have nice."}
{"text":"Cleveland pizza sucks,  this place is a great example.  Did I order a SCHOOL PIZZA? No. Then why did I receive this thick,  square,  chewy doughy crap-za? This whole town has to have the WORST pizza ever.  Very few places around,  other paces closed on weekends? Ugh. Save yourself the fatness, this pizza ain't worth it.  UPDATE: The owner read my review and thinks this looks good.  Need I say more? Niko, this looks like the pizza at my kids school, but worse cuz its missing a side of apple sauce and a chocolate milk."}
{"text":"2 stars only because the pizza itself was somewhat decent (those which were made right). Everything else was bad.   Garlic bread was not good. Service was mostly horrible. Ordered 3 vegetarian pizzas on the phone. Wife was put on hold 3 different times while trying to order, and person on the other end kept insisting 'pepperoni' several times after my wife said we were vegetarian.   When we picked up the pizza and brought it back, one of the pizzas had ham on them. So had to bring it back. Refund at least was efficiently handled.   We are typically in this area of cleveland once a year, and will for sure avoid this place next time. There's enough pizza on this block that the bad service here, and only semi-decent food, doesn't have to be tolerated."}
{"text":"Placed an order around 10:00 pm Tuesday via the Grubhub (GH) app and waited for delivery. Less than 15 minutes after placing my order I get a call from GH saying that Rascal House does not deliver to my address. Huh? GH doesn't discriminate by neighborhood and delivers anywhere. The representative then said that Rascal House uses their own drivers, not GH's. I asked if they don't deliver to my address then why does the app say they do? She gave no reasonable answer. I informed her that Rascal House has been in Cleveland for years and has never delivered to Black neighborhoods. And had I known RH and not GH drivers did the delivering even when ordering through the GH app I would have never placed the order knowing their long-standing policy. I ordered via the GH site and assumed a GH driver would make the delivery. I ended up with no food. GH should delete RH from my zip code and all others that they refuse to service."}
{"text":"The pizza is not as bad as some people make it sound. yes its sweet and not a traditional pizza crust, but when its hot its tasty. Its not a traditional Italian pizza, but then most of the pizza you find in Cleveland is not authentic by any stretch of the imagination. Since most Clevelanders adore Pizza Hut and Papa John's chains, I can't understand why Rascal House supposedly serves such garbage? but on a more serious note, the place is not very clean. the mens room smells like a medley of bodily fluids and the tables can be greasy. I've never gotten sick from here, unlike some other pizza places in the city."}
{"text":"I am checked in to the Double Tree the lady at the front desk gave me a menu. She said the best Wings and Italian around. I ordered the 6 pack of wings with Blue cheese and celery and the Pasta with meat balls. There order taker asked what I wanted for Dressing for my Salad and confirmed with me that there was a up charge for celery and Blue cheese for my wings. I said cool she said 49 minutes. It was right at 40 minutes. The wings were good and spicy the Blue cheese was real small but they were good. The pasta bowl was huge and the meatballs were ok. The salad did not show up or did the celery. The pasta and wings were enough. And it was cheaper then room service but I do think they need to check there orders before they bring them out. But for room delivered food not bad. I"}
{"text":"For all the years I've lived in Cleveland, I had only gone to Rascal House Pizza once or twice at most, because no one ever suggests it, indicating there are plenty of better places. One nice thing about RHP is that it's open until 2. I was there for the Cleveland Garlic Festival, instead of waking up after a nice short nap to go get a real meal like normal people, we woke up at 12:30am. Oops! Even room service had stopped serving, so we found out about RHP through the hotel front desk. It's very basic, you order food at the counter, pick up your food at the counter, and eat at one of the few tables in the restaurant. We got the Philly sandwich. Given that it's not Philly, I wasn't expecting much, but for what it's worth, at 1:30am, it wasn't half bad. We also got some wings, and they were really good. It's not bad place for a college town pizza place, but I wouldn't go there with too high of expectations."}
{"text":"Waited a ridiculously long time to get our food. Came in on a Sunday at 3pm, we are the only customers here,& there are seven workers back there... very disappointed.   Awful customer service. The girl who took my order could have cared less.  The manager sitting in his office also was not interested in managing his staff.  Will not return"}
{"text":"Delivers past 10pm! Yes, they're a pizza outfit, but they also have non-pizza offerings: sandwiches, chicken tenders, chicken wings, pasta, wraps, salads, desserts.  Rascal's also offers family-sized portions of pasta dinners like their Rigatoni with meatballs (serves as many as 25)!  I'm not a pizza fan (unless it's deep-dish Little Star from San Francisco), so I was glad to see non-pizza options.  I ordered \"The Italiano,\" an Italian sub that consisted of capocolo, smoked ham, pepperoni, salami, onions, banana peppers, and provolone cheese. Dressed with a nice tart vinaigrette, I was fairly pleased with the sandwich.  Greek salad is also fine, with fetas and Kalamatas. The two dishes proved a bit too much food for me, though, and I only had a couple of bites of the salad..."}
{"text":"What on earth was I thinking?   I know Rascal House pizza is terrible-- weird, sweet crust reminiscent of bisquick, sweet sauce, tasteless toppings.  It was one of three places to eat on Euclid whilst I was taking my Bar Review at CSU (not as fun as it sounds-- bar exam review, not a review of bars).  The other two were an Arby's and a scary greasy spoon.  So I ended up having at Rascal House more times than I care to count.  Imagine having to study for the most important test of your life AND having to eat bad pizza along with it.  The horror.  The horror.  I've had it since then, because downtown firms always seem to order it for working lunches.  It has not improved.  So, here I am, back at CSU to take a few classes.  What to have for lunch.  I'm pretty sick of Subway.  Nothing at the school food service looks good today.  What to get?  A salad.  How hard can a salad be?  Surely Rascal House has a simple, tasty salad.  Most  pizza places do.  Swamp water.  That's what it tasted like.  The lettuce bore the unmistakeable taste of pre-cut, bagged lettuce that had been siting in the cooler for a while until someone opend it and dumped it into a container without washing it.  (I worked at a few dives to put myself through undergrad.  I know how that works.)  The carrot shreds were completly dry and had absorbed whatever scary odors were going around the cooler.  The turkey and ham were both of the ultra processed, parts-is-parts variety. there was about a tablespoon of cheese and two tiny slices of hard boiled egg.  Sad.  THEN, I had to eat it whilst listening to really bad, really loud 1980s top 40.   No Cure, no Depeche Mode.  1980s Hambone music.  I'm going out to find an insulated lunch bag."}
{"text":"Ordered a sausage and pepperoni pizza with 6 party wings.....Was absolutely disgusting. The pizza taste extremely generic and the wings were overdone and swimming in a very weird tasting version of barbecue sauce. It actually caused my kitchen to smell funny.   Do NOT waste your money. I am originally from Chicago (been in Cleveland 3 months) so I can be a hard food critic....especially when it comes to pizza....but trust me, it was still very very very below the edible grade-level.   Oh, how could I forget, 10-15 minutes after I placed my order I realized the delivery guy may not be able to offer change for a $100 bill, so I called back to verify and to pay via credit card in the event he could not. After being tossed around by 2-3 different people whom seemed oblivious to what I was explicating, the final guy, the manager, says he doesn't see my name in the computer for an order. I throughly explained my order and gave my name multiple times and he responded by saying...\"I don't see your order, I don't know what to tell you\".....Then asked if I would like to place another order. I explained that I would not be placing another order because I just placed one 15 minutes ago and he responded with \"Yeah because if the delivery guy is out with your order then the order won't be on the screen anymore\".........Why in the world wouldn't he make that connection initially instead of trying to convince me I called one of the other Rascal chains and saying \"I don't know what to tell you\".   Nevertheless, food arrived, paid via card, and regretted  the entire experience."}
{"text":"Good food for delivery at 1:30 am. Was happy to find a place that offered more than just pizza at the late hour. Food was delivered fast and hot."}
{"text":"I would advise calling first.  The hours listed are not accurate for the dining room.  I showed up 2 minutes late and missed out.  Probably not worth the risk if late night.   I can only give one star because of the unreliability."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in town! I travel to Cleveland from Los Angeles for business almost every other month, and I've tried almost all the pizza locations in town and Rascal House has the best pizza."}
{"text":"Good whole pizza.   Macaroni salad taste a little bit like rubber crayons.  Overall food is good."}
{"text":"Hanging at the Hilton Downtown Cleveland hotel. Great property. Watching the OSU/Penn State game (BOO)...my Buckeyes lost. We were wanting something yummy some pizza and asked the front desk where to order. He presented us with a menu from Rascal's.   Med Veggie with garlic dipping sauce and marinara sauce add jalapenos on the pie.   We didn't say a word to each other just SCARFED that pizza down. The young man brought the pizza up to Eliot's Bar on the 2nd floor to us $22 that's it. Rounded him up to $30 and bam. It was INCREDIBLE. Crust was perfect, just enough sauce."}
{"text":"Very clean and quick.  Pizza was decent (very above-average for fast food) but the really great thing was the wings.  They Remind me of Western NY, though ya can't beat Buffalo."}
{"text":"At first: when i called them and ask if they deliver said \"NO\".. And then i went over and they messed up with my order and waited there for 40mins for a single pizza. Finally i got my pizza and came to my hotel and found out that wad not what i ordered either... I don't know what else to say.."}
{"text":"my best food experience in Cleveland came from this place.  it was super late when we were walking back to the hotel from the agora, and this was the only thing that was open, sadly we came very very close to the time to the closing time, so pizza was not an option (cause of the snow storm they shut the ovens down early?) anyways I opted out for some gyros and man they were fantastic. super fresh toppings and they have a great tzatziki sauce that goes with the sandwich. even though I don't live in Cleveland or the U.S.A. I want to bring this place to Toronto. much love  if you are in the area definitely give it a shot."}
