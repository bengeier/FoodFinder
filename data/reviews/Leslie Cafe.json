{"text":"The food is pretty ok here.. But I found part of a clear plastic bag in my food once."}
{"text":"For the price you pay, you cant go wrong with it.  The breakfast special comes with egg omelette, noodles, toast and a hot drink for 6 bucks.. you cant go wrong with that.."}
{"text":"They've changed their menus since the last time I ate here. The prices have gone up. Before, the lunch and dinner combos came with a drink and soup but now at the same price you only get the main plate. If you want a drink and soup you have to pay an extra $2. 

The ambiance at this restaurant is very pleasant and cheery mainly due to the music playing and the colourful interior. It is very clean and nothing to complain about the service. 

The food choices here are the norm of a hong kong cafe style restaraunt.

They only take cash here, but there is a CIBC in the same plaza if you forgot to bring cash. They close at 10pm everyday."}
{"text":"It's OK for what you pay. Cheap eats. cha chang teng.  It's decent for a late night fix or casual lunch.  Don't expect service. Cleanliness is also questionable. What do you expect for HK Cafe food?"}
{"text":"Located in a complex that is anchored by Sunny Supermarket, there are a lot of other choices. What drew us to this place was the promise of cold HK milk tea. On that front, it did not disappoint. I'd give this place 4 stars if that were my only criteria. Why I docked it one star: Around JUne '12 when they jacked up their prices. OK jacked up = started charging $2 for combos of soup and HK tea- which previously came with meals). Hard to adjust perception when you're so used to the cheap stuff. Ostentsibly they were trying to improve their image: menus became nicer, and colored paper stuck to the wall advertising specials, disappeared. Not sure it was worth the extra toonies ;)

Food:
Baked pork chop with spaghetti and cream sauce- 4 stars. 
Baked chix with spaghetti and black bean sauce- 4 stars. 
Baked garoupa with black bean sauce - 3 stars
Pork Chop with Instant Noodles  (afternoon menu)  - 3 stars
Pork Vermicelli with bacon and egg (breakfast menu) - 3 stars
Fried Beef with spaghetti (afternoon menu) - 3 stars
Ham and cheese (afternoon menu) - 2 stars"}
{"text":"Usually come here once a week since I live fairly close.

Solid and dependable food. You can get pretty large portions for a fairly cheap price. I usually get their lemongrass pork chop, \"ho fan,\" one of their fried vermicelli, or a super cheap breakfast combo. Their steak is a little chewy and their baked rice dishes are a little bland so I try to avoid those. The restaurant was renovated about a year ago and has a modern albeit spartan decor. The servers are friendly. There's also an added bonus of a bakery and Chinese supermarket in the same plaza so you can buy groceries after lunch.

Overall, 3 stars because they're dependable with good service and good prices, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Theyre always busy but service speed is always fast. The food is good for the cheap price. Would go for a quick lunch with a big selection of western type food and Asian food. 

Servers are nice."}
{"text":"Great value. Come here when you don't feel like cooking and want variety. They have cheap sets including soup, entree and coffee, OR go for the meal sets of 2,3,4 or 6 dishes (14.99, 19.99, 25.99, and 36.99 respectively). Portions are generous and there are 32 dishes to choose from ranging from Italian red wine beef to sweet and sour chicken. I had the coconut scented Portuguese chicken which was creamy and flavourful, along with bass and veggies simmered in rice wine as well as bitter melon and egg.  The set comes with soup, but you have to order your own rice. 

All dishes were pretty good and I had plenty of leftovers to enjoy for a future meal. 

Also you can ask them to hold the MSG. 
The only caveat is the combo sets described above must be chosen from a Chinese only menu taped on the window. With my poor Chinese reading skills, it was a bit overwhelming. 

I'm generally not a fan of HK Cha Chan Ting, but this is okay lah."}
{"text":"The very last restaurant at Leslie Plaza that did not receive my patronage.
I never given this place any thought, but from now on I'll be using more of my head, because I loved this place.

This is hardly a cafe, as there are never people here solely drinking coffee or stealing WIFI. This is more on the sides of what Macau people eat, with Hong Kong style dishes and drinks. The food by far one of the cleanest anywhere in this plaza. 
The food is delicious, the typically named teriyaki chicken with rice doesn't taste so typical, the curry beef brisket comes with big chucks of meat on steamed rice. Most main entries (if not all) comes with a free drink. 
Booth/stall seating along the walls, and table seating on the dining floor.
The decor is colour, this is as complicated as it gets. No expenses spared for ambiance. No need in my opinion, well lit and well cooked food is enough, and they got that.

I brought my Iranian friend Arrash here, and he didn't understand what was happening. I told him that this was apart of the collective culinary diversity of China, despite not looking like the typical chicken balls and sandwich fried rice or whateverthehell he was used to. He loved it, and so the two of us men awkwardly said little to each other during the course of food munching. Because that's what guys do at restaurants, we eat. 
The food did take over ten minutes of wait, but that just assures me the food is being relatively freshly prepared. 
The service is not very engaging, I would liked to have chatted with our waitress just a little bit. But the burly who was also serving food offered the same service, and so I was happy that this was the standard, just in case I got him the next time.

A very unassuming restaurant that dishes up some truly simple but great food, and it's all at a very reasonable price. I stress that this place has some very reasonable prices!

I should have came here earlier, but like it says in the Bible; those who are first come last, and..those who are last..come first or something like that. This place is now my first choice at Leslie Plaza. Amen to that!

Open from 8-10 on weekdays, cash only!!"}
{"text":"You really can't complain about this place. Very good value with generous portions. I can eat like a champ here after a workout. Most of their dishes come with a soup or hot drink.  You add a little more for a cold drink. It's a pretty typical HK style cafe. If you don't feel like cooking that day, just come here. Every time I come here, it's usually pretty full especially on the weekend. The only thin I don't like is the parking in the plaza. It's gridlock some times because everyone wants to park next to entrances...I just don't get it...they have ample above ground parking but people for whatever reason don't like to walk down stairs? ??  Then there are those who do park in the above ground parking and choose to walk down the drive ramp instead of the stairs???  Listen, cars don't cause traffic flow problems, people do. People are so confused.  Anyway that has nothing to do with this cafe....give the cafe a try folks!"}
{"text":"Came here after a very stressful morning. Ordered a simple chow mein and beef with rice noodles and everything was fine, nothing really memorable or enjoyable. Overall, I would visit Leslie Cafe out of convenience only but would not go out of my way to come here. The meh-ness of the restaurant is probably indicated by this short review simply because I don't really know what more can be said about this place."}
{"text":"It's okay. Food isn't the greatest... It's decent. Probably worth 2 stars but I'd give it an extra star because prices are pretty good. Combo dinners come with a small soup and milk tea... Both good

Wifi and parking available

Cash only"}
{"text":"Go here when you want a cheaper chinese meal. For the price here, it's actually cheaper than fast food. They have sandwiches and noodles from $3 to $6 which is as cheap as it can get. I usually get the lunch or dinner set meals which includes soup and tea or coffee. 

Sometimes its just a good place to go to for take out or a quick meal for a good value. Of course, it's not the best food bit for this value, it's really good."}
{"text":"Clean, but service was really slow and the food has much to improve.  So, I tried to order the grass jelly drink and they ran out of grass jelly.  Then I tried to order the red bean ice cream, and they ran out of ice cream.  Then I tried to order the jackfruit slush, and they ran out of jackfruit!  

Ironically, this Hong Kongnese style cafe is right across from a grocery store.  The baked pork chop rice was a little undercooked.  :("}
{"text":"Honestly you can't go wrong with a meal for two for $12 including taxes and tea. 

It's HK Cafe Style aka western food. There's a certain taste to this and usually quality is pretty standard. 

Before 5:30pm on a weekend, we got $4.75 for a medium side beef brisket and tendon soup noodles (yum), and a curry ox tongue  rice for $5.75. We were starved and gobbled it up immediately. 
It comes with a HK style tea. 

It was a great pick for some comfort food."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my go-to places to eat whenever I'm in the North York area. But it underwent (owner) transition during the summer months and I haven't visited during that time because I thought the food and waiting service was a mess. Most importantly for me, their HK-style milk tea was terrible (aka no quality and very syrup-y) =( 

I revisited it today after taking a short break from Fairview mall for a late night dinner just before our 10pm movie, and I'd say they've done a good job picking themselves back up from that transition. For sure, their menus have changed and prices went up a bit, but quality's still the same or similar. What I've noticed (1) their actual physical menus changed (2) fewer baked rice/spaghetti options (3) and most importantly, their HK-style milk tea did me well this time! I savoured it so much that despite them closing, I did not want to leave my few sips' worth in my cup and just had to stay behind, take my time and enjoy that last bit. 

4 stars for great ambiance. Clean (if you don't look at the floors at the end of the day). Typical HK-style service. Cash only. If you talk to the new owner - new to Toronto and most often you'll find him sitting at the cash -  I'm sure you'll be able to 10% off him  ;)"}
{"text":"HK style French toast though."}
{"text":"The Chinese name for this place actually incorporates the term \"Ice Chamber\" which was a variation of the HK-style Restaurant. More info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cha_chaan_teng 

It was available in Hong Kong as a place to have a meal from a smaller menu within an Air Conditioned environment when most homes couldn't afford AC back in the day. 

This Ice Chamber however had a decent variety of items/combos to choose from. Ox Tongue Spaghetti Dinner Meal($6.99) is quite a deal and there is a reason for that. 

It came with a choice of Chinese or Western Soup which was Borscht for me. It was decent and it even had a surprise for me as a piece of Duck Skin from BBQ Duck was inside. Maybe it's a secret flavour? Good thing I eat shit all the time. 

The Ox Tongue Spaghetti had good portion of Pasta and Tender Beef Tongue in a Black Pepper Sauce with Onion/Mushrooms/Bell Pepper julienne topped with some dried Oregano flakes. 

You get what you pay for and as it came with a choice of hot drink, I guess it's closer to A-OK for the value conscious quantity over quality crowd. I tried the Milk Tea which is A-OK as you add your own Sugar to it. 

The decor is alright and the BOOTH seating a plenty. The seats were cushioned however the back support was lacking as all you're leaning on is really a hard ass divider that was 90 degree angle."}
{"text":"When this restaurant first came out, I would dine here quite often for their afternoon tea specials. At that time the food was pretty good all the time and the service was excellent. But within the past year my experience here has declined dramatically. 

My last experience here was not good at all. I ordered the steak and fries and the steak was completely raw inside and leaking red blood. Normally a good piece of meat you can still eat undercooked and digest it pleasantly. But not this time, I had to chew and chew for over a minute only to spit out the meat because the tendons and meat were still too raw. The fries were okay, hard to go wrong there. My partner ordered the black pepper spaghetti and it was also a disappointment. The chef's attempt at 'wok hay' turned out to be a burnt and smokey spaghetti. We saw some other tables complain about their spaghetti and the waiters took it back to the kitchen.

Overall my experience here has been hit and miss. With some luck on what you order and praying a good chef is preparing it, then you may get to eat some pretty decent food. I rather take my wallet to one of the other restaurants in that plaza where the food quality is more consistent."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the area for HK-style food. The quality is good - not outstanding. It's what you would typically expect from this type of place, and so is the service (which is to say they get their job done and not much more). Still, I love coming for the low priced mini specials in the afternoon. The milk tea is oh-so-creamy, made the way I like it."}
{"text":"Leslie Cafe is no more. Tasty Delight, Fusion Cuisine has replaced Leslie Cafe. You all know what adding the word Fusion means right? Prices have risen and the cheap HK Cafe combos are gone! Portions were noticeably smaller as well."}
{"text":"The food is okay, the service was horrible. The waitress was very rude and said nasty comment in Cantonese about me which I understood. I was there twice, but I probably wont go back, unless the service improves."}
{"text":"The small and compact Leslie and Finch Plaza is a treasure trove of great places to eat and buy your groceries.  Today, we went for the second time to the Leslie Cafe.  I believe that it's one of the best uber cheap places I've ever eaten.  

Average price for a meal is $6.50 and that is a lot of food.  Good variety and very tasty; it's a great place to replace cooking at home.  The food is served quickly and it comes with milk tea or coffee.  The main entrees come with choice of soup.

For a quick and easy place to eat... this is the one.  Or you can check out the other restaurants in the same plaza."}
{"text":"Came here for afternoon tea. I ordered the chicken omelet in white sauce with fries, and my husband ordered the beef brisket noodles. 

The mushrooms in the omelet were not fresh and from cans, the fries basically tasted like cheap frozen fries that were reheated, the beef brisket was slightly tough. 

Their dinner meals aren't bad but won't come back again for afternoon tea unless hungry, tired and desperate."}
{"text":"So my friend and I were trying to find a place near our area for breakfast/brunch.  She suggested this restaurant considering that it was in between where we both lived.  I've passed by it ten million times and the décor looked really good, so it didn't hurt to try it out.

So we went.  

The choices for a HK styled café were similar to any other café.  Choices were limited, and for any other Canadian Born Chinese person, it just wasn't very appetizing.  

I got myself a pickled vegetable and meat with vermicelli dish + egg, spam, and toast.  Nothing special there.  Small portions for the noodles, but it was enough for me.

You would get a tea with your meal as well, but they brought it to me in the beginning of my meal!  Usually they would ask you if you want your drink or after the meal.  I prefer after.  By the time I was done my meal and wanted to drink my (was) hot milk tea - it was cold.

Cheap place for food, but I know I could spend my money on something else."}
{"text":"I went to the plaza for Korean food, but instead, we went to Leslie cafe.  The pork hock
noodle with the special price of $5.99 which was posted in the window had drawn my attention. 
The servers suggested $18 lobster noodle which was good for two.  My hubby and I didn't want lobster, and she suggested Chui Chow duck.  We ordered the duck and a
taro Chinese sausage rice in hot pot.  They gave us free lotus root soup as well.
The soup came in hot and it tasted like homemade.  The duck was excellent and so was rice.  The duck is better than other Chiu Chow restaurants, and honestly, it is by far the best.  I will sure go back to try their pork hock noodle, and other Chui Chow food."}
{"text":"Lemongrass pork chop: have NEVER had better and believe you me, I eat this often.

Beef chow fun: maybe have never had better. The \"wok hay\" (wok air) is so delectable that I wanna lick up the plate. It is never greasy.

Portuguese pork chop dish is also really good but I personally like a fried rice instead of the white rice served.

This food is freakin' amazing so I really absolutely have no idea what's up with the low ratings. It's almost always packed with authentic Chinese patrons & all different age groups come here. My bf's parents come here once a week or two.

Breakfast will cost u 5 bucks to split their huge portions for 2 ppl. We come here as 4 ppl and split 3 dishes and each dish also comes with a drink (HK style milk tea, coffee or lemon honey tea) and a soup (Chinese style broth or veggie tomato broth). You will be full!!!!

Service is fast, plates are big, prices are good and most importantly, the food is GREAT."}
{"text":"I have been here three times. For some reason everytime I come here, they do a very good job in disappointing me.. I have ordered three dishes in total and their food is disgusting! Their food overall doesnt taste good. However there should be some good dishes, it is just you need to find those out!"}
{"text":"Like most of the other reviews say, relatively cheap HK cafe that has ur usually baked rice dishes and such...most of the lunch combos come with a hot drink and soup (questionable bout the quality)....free WIFI here, service is quick and friendly

Got the eggplant with spicy sauce in efu noodle for $8.55...big portion flavorful but I was soooooooo dam thirsty after, bet it was drenched in MSG and now my tummy is feeling kind of off :$

So u've been warned"}
{"text":"You certainly get what you pay for here. The deals are a little alluring w/ the set lunch/dinner combos (comes w/ your choice of chinese soup/veg soup & drink) for approx $6.99 +. But don't let that fool u... def. not the best tasting nor great ingredients. Hubby's baked pork chop w/ tomato sauce was full of fat... nearly half was fat. I should've taken a pic of the fat he cut out :) Other than that it was ok but def. had better at other places.

The service was so slow. I have been here 2 times and its always slow. They've also mastered the art of ignoring customers.

They do not accept credit cards"}
{"text":"I always drink too much when I fly ... so being hungover after a red eye is no beuno. 

So obviously when it came time to order breakfast, I wanted congee.  Prices here are really cheap - but not certain it was worth the 35 min drive out here during rush hour traffic. 

Still - for around $5.00 you get congee, noodles (or toast) and milk coffee - not a bad deal.  Lots of other Asian breakfast specials to choose from.  I ended up pouring half a bottle of salt into my congee to try to give it some flavor."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times and I always come for the same dish. Porkchop Cutlet on rice. It is amazing. Not many HK style food resturants in this area so it is a good spot for cheap food that has decent quality.

I have tried other dishes but it is not as tasty and flavorful as the Porkchop Cutlet. It comes with your choice of soup or hot drink. 

Service is on par and it is Cash only."}
{"text":"i've only tried the BBT here.. it was ok. they only accept cash, so don't be one of those that only carry their debit or credit out!! probably gonna come back, and try something else besides bbt"}
{"text":"Not the best HK style food and it is a bit bland.. but if you're in the area and you're craving HK style food, go for it! Fairly priced, and good portions. 

Baked pork chop had a ton of cheese on top, but since I'm a cheese lover I didn't mind it and probably would order again. 

HK milk tea was a way too bitter."}
{"text":"Afternoon Tea Specials at Leslie Cafe is A-OK.

I am not complaining too much as I got

Rice Noodle Soup with Beef Brisket  and a Hong Kong Style milk tea for $3.99

The noodle was served boiling hot... so so hot that I burnt the side of my mouth... 

The Milk Tea did get a little cool by the time I finished slurping my noodles.... next time I should have request to be serve after my meals!!

Cash ONLY!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and the food was generally lacking in flavour.

We tried 3 different meal combos:

1. LEMONGRASS PORK CHOP was fatty and cooked to the right amount, but the pork chop itself lacked flavour. The flavour comes from the sauce. I enjoyed this dish the most. 

2. HAINANESE CHICKEN was overcooked and stringy. This chicken is supposed to be smooth and succulent but it was neither. The accompanying scallion-ginger sauce was fine.

3. SATAY HO FUN (fried rice noodle) lacked flavour. Noodles themselves were an okay texture.

Service was not helpful & also on the rude side.  We had to ask 3-4 times for our tea, which comes with the meal combos. In fact, we were still asking for the tea even after we'd been billed. 

If forced to eat here, I'd opt for the Lemongrass pork chop. But, I'd rather not be forced to eat here. There are much better options around."}
{"text":"I've been here many times: cheap food, ok quality, big portions. Great for students on a budget."}
{"text":"meh, typical HK diner.

prices arent amazing but they arent bad either.  cold milk tea is hit and miss here too...prepare for niagara falls in the toilet (im not talking about pee)"}
