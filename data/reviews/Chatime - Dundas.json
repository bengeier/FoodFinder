{"text":"This store is very inconsistent with honoring Chatime promotions. Chatime is currently giving out red pockets when you purchase ANY 2 drinks. Yesterday, I bought 2 tea of the months @ another location and was given a red pocket. Today, at this location, they refused to give me one claiming it excludes tea of the month purchases. I repeatedly told them to look at their poster which plainly said, 'with the purchase of any 2 drinks'. There was no small print whatsoever. They were rude and condescending. 
During Christmas time, they were offering 2 large drink vouchers for $10. I went to use these vouchers earlier this month, and they also would not honor it, claiming they do not honor free drink coupons. I paid for these vouchers, they were not free. I even bought it at this same location. 
WUT DA FOOK?"}
{"text":"This is a great option for bubble tea and other delicious milk tea or coffee drinks in downtown Toronto. We were in Toronto for a week and came here almost everyday - my favorites are the roasted milk tea with grass jelly or the QQ milk tea, which comes with coconut jelly and bubbles. Get the stamp card - buy 10 and get one regular size for free! Only downside is that drinks are pricey (expect to pay $5 total or more per drink, incl tax)!"}
{"text":"I don't get what's the hype about ChaTime when you can get pretty much the SAME bubble tea across the street for a lesser price. 

Yes, you can customize your drink but all the other bubble tea places let you too. 

Bubble tea here is WAY to sweet and even when I asked for a lot less sugar, I still feel like I'm drinking syrup. 

Workers there weren't that nice, I guess it's due to the amount of people they have to serve but they give you attitude if you don't order immediately. 

Line ups are always long and there's never enough room to ACTUALLY LINE UP. Everyone's just crammed inside the tiny tea shop and it's always so loud in there.

I don't get why everyone thinks this is \"the best\" bubble tea shop, because I've had way better, and cheaper bubble tea.

Come here if you want your money to get scammed in return for a crap bubble tea."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday evening and there were  long lines. It's good that a staff member ask us what be wanted and wrote it down before we were at the cashier to order. I don't know if it was busy or what buy the other staff seemed like robots and were not very friendly. QQ Lycée juice was not bad"}
{"text":"Chatime has the best bubble tea in Toronto.

You can also customize your drink, by telling them how much sugar and ice you want. If Starbucks is the place for customizing your coffee, Chatime is the place for customizing your bubble tea. 

They take awhile to make your drink because this place is always crowded - especially at night time. The place is also tinyyy and it's really hard to find a seat during their busy hours. Chatime is definitely not somewhere like Go For Tea or Destiny if you wanna chat with your friends. I noticed that most people do takeouts. 

Note: You will see \"QQ\" on some drink names. QQ = tapioca and jelly"}
{"text":"I visited Chatime last week on a weekday just before 1 o'clock. It was not too busy at the time. My friend suggested that I try the Chatime Roasted Milk Tea with grass jelly. She even specifically told me to order it with less ice and 80% sugar. The taste is pretty interesting and I like it. For whatever reason, it reminds me of VitaSoy's malted soybean milk. Mmm...and I love grass jelly!

I took another friend of mine to try their Roasted Milk Tea with grass jelly last night. Despite being a rainy Wednesday evening, we still had to wait 20 minutes in line. This little teashop was incredibly crowded. But once I placed our order, it was not long before we received our drinks. 

The cashier also gave me a reward card last night. You receive one point for every drink, and after 10 points, you get a free regular tea. 

Aside from the Roasted Milk Tea, I also ordered a Matcha Tea Latte. It was very powdery and it was bitter even with 80% sugar. (I will just go to Starbucks if I ever want a green tea latte...)

I'm sure I will return because I like the fact that they give you the option to choose how much ice and sugar you want in your drink, and the Roasted Milk Tea is pretty good."}
{"text":"My first experience came at the hands of a friend who worked right next to the place. I've had bubble tea before (with the Boba and tapioca) so I thought, \"meh how much different could this be?!\". The answer is: quite different. These guys are a Taiwanese chain which carries all types of teas, lattes, slushes and coffees. When you order you line up along side the narrow pathway. When is your turn to order, you are asked what do you want. I recommend you try the coconut Chai latte, but if that doesn't float your metaphorical boat, try any of the top 10 selections (including the regular Chai tea). You will also be asked on your sugar preference (less, regular, more). Most of the drinks are available both hot or cold, so make sure you tell them if you want hot otherwise the default is cold. Great place to take friends or grab an alternative to Starbucks. Also something nice to sip on while you wait in line for uncle tetsu's cheesecake just down the street."}
{"text":"Honestly I know this place is popular but I really don't like their drinks. Got their Qq milk tea. It tastes like milk and there were so little toppings even tho I got a large. The tapioca was so so. The coconut jelly tastes really weird in the milk tea. When I ordered I thought it was going to be jelly noodle since the menu does not specify, just have photos to show some white stuff and called it QQ. Anyways don't think I will come back. Kung fu tea shop has much better tea and is not stingy with their toppings. If they are still in business...."}
{"text":"Maybe it's the fact that I don't get bubble tea like this in Montreal, but this tea is so good! The roasted milk tea is really tasty. I got it with aloe vera but would prob get tapioca next time around! Yum!"}
{"text":"This bubble tea place isso overrated, always huge lineups which helps create the buzz but you can find so many other equal or even better bubbletea places in the downtown core where you don't have to wait 20minutes in line to get your tea!"}
{"text":"Out of convenience sake, I go here often with friends. But if I could, I'd go to another cha time or bubble tea place in general.

The staff at this location is definitely sub-par. The bubble tea is surprisingly better at other cha time locations. So besides it being a convenient place to chill with friends, there are many better places (bubble tea or not) to get better service and drinks."}
{"text":"Chatime never disappoints me! Quick and extremely friendly service. The workers here are really nice and seem to genuinely like their jobs, which gives a good atmosphere. :)

Came in here on a cold Sunday and there wasn't too big of a line. Ordered a regular roasted tea latte with tapioca for $4.70 and it was served in under a minute!

Great location. Will be coming here again. The hot roasted tea latte wasn't that good. I may try the matcha tea latte next time!"}
{"text":"The best bubble tea I ever tasted.  
My friend bought a strawberry, and I got a mango.  We had the option of adjusting the amount of sugar and ice.  We kept it at normal but I should have lessened the sugar because it was pretty sweet. I ordered the mango but I liked my friends strawberry milk tea better.  It was made with real strawberries and didn't taste like powdered mix.  Very flavourful.  
The only problem is the price.  Its a little near the higher end with about $5 per cup so I can't buy it too often."}
{"text":"BEST DESSERT DRINKS IN TOWN!!

This place is always packed but it's worth it. Most of the time I have to line-up . My personal favourite is their Roasted Milk Tea with Grass Jelly. YUMMM!! You can choose the level of sugar (normal, 80%, 50%, no sugar) and level of ice (normal, less ice, no ice). I usually get 50% sugar and less ice. They have the card you can get to collect points and get a free drink after you collect so much points."}
{"text":"I've heard alot about Chatime from my friends so i decided to try it out. After waiting a long time in line due to the cashier chatting with the customers in front of me, It was finally my turn to order. The cashier wasnt nearly as friendly with me as she was with people infront of me so that was kind of disappointing, then I finally order my drink and somehow my drink was ready before the people infront of me causing mass confusion, then when I tried my drink (QQ honeydew milk tea with less sugar) its was super-sweet, almost undrinkable, I feel like they messed up the amout of sugar. It was obviously made from a powder, and the tapioca bubbles were too chewy, almost like gum. I did enjoy the purple straws ... so they've got that going for them. Overall I was very disappointed with my experience here. I guess ive been spoiled by other quality bubble tea shops. 

Also im not sure why Chatime is rated $ and Comebuy is rated $$$, their prices are the same except Comebuy is way better."}
{"text":"I was craving a honey milk tea one day and decided it was worth the long line-up on weekday night. I have previously tried the Chatime red bean milk tea which I am very fond of, as well as the roasted milk tea with grass jelly. Anyway, when it was finally my turn, I asked for honey instead of regular sugar. The cashier was confused but suggested \"honey green tea or honey black tea\". Ok, so I assume they have honey, so I tried \"honey black tea with milk\". She replied: \"oh no! We can't do that!\" Huh? If one can order honey green/black tea, logically you could have milk with it, no? After a minute of confusion, I settled with the original Chatime milk tea with tapioca, dissatisfied and more confused. Perhaps Chatime regulars could fill me in what happened there?!!

For now, I guess I'll have to settle with Tea 168 for honey milk black tea..."}
{"text":"Chatime is a very nice addition to the downtown core. They have a very wide range of flavours and I appreciate how they give you the option of reducing the amounts of sugar/ice in your drink.

It's a decent size store and there are a couple of tables for seating. The back wall is also filled with quotes from various people regarding tea... I do question if the quotes are real because some of them are pretty funny. Not a bad place to stop by and grab a drink! 

Only thing that was \"bad\" was that last night when I went.. it smelled really really bad.... like dirty towels sort of bad. It also didn't help that it was very stuffy inside the store. That one time encounter won't deter me from coming back... unless it is constantly like that."}
{"text":"The tea here is pretty on point. But the bubble/pearls are another story. I come from Los Angeles and am a huge fan of teas and bubble. The bubble was a bit tough and wasn't warm either. Compared to my home town pearls, this place had pretty basic quality pearls. My mum had their regular milk tea and I wanted their yogurt black tea, unfortunately they only had green tea which was still very refreshing! The long was a bit long too.. Might be because the shop is small tho.. I'd come again for the tea, not the bubble/pearls."}
{"text":"Best Bubble tea in Toronto!

The price range said on this page is false though. For a cup of bubble tea it is quite expensive compared to many stores. But $5+ for a bubble tea here is worth it. If it was not they would not be getting any business.

The variety they have here is not just the regular menu you see at other stores. Here they have toppings such as Grass jelly, Red bean, Coffee jelly, Aloe Vera, Pudding and etc. Plus they have many special drinks you never heard of before.

One good option they have here that no other place has is that they have a \"Sugar option\" which lets you choose how much sugar you would desire to be put in your drink. 
-0% No sugar
- 70% Less sugar
-100% Normal sugar
They also have an \"Ice option\" which is the same idea.

5 stars! Love drinking here. Only problem would be price but like I said before; it is worth it"}
{"text":"So I've been there for severals time and their drinks are just perfect. Got a Taro Milk Tea with pearls and grass jelly, 50% sugar and less ice last time and it's just fantastic. A bit thicker taste compared to others store but for me its just perfectly made. 

This place is always full loaded, lined up in a S shape especially weekends. Seems like this place is a bit understaffed (compared to the line up and there was only 3 workers working on a friday night). However, their speed is still pretty fast.

Customer service wasn't that bad as some of the comments mentioned, last time a staff named Michael ( or Matthew, couldn't really see well from their nametag) showed a great respect to the customer in front of me, switching drinks for her, and answered her questions with patience. At least thats what i saw from last time...

Prices are a bit higher than other stores and that slightly deducted the mark in my mind.

Remember to grab a stamp on your membership card before you leave, you'll get a free drink pretty soon :P"}
{"text":"I came downtown to try what my friends had bragged about. Out of curiosity, I bought two drinks, the peach green tea as well as the matcha mouse, both with less ice. This place has by far the best bubble tea in Toronto. Here, I can actually taste the freshness and the TEA, unlike other bubble tea shops where all I taste and feel is powder lingering into my tongue. 

Ps. I finished them both. I have never drank so much at once in my life."}
{"text":"I only get the roasted milk tea with tapioca from here so the 5 stars is for this drink. Nice deep flavour and quickly made."}
{"text":"Chatime just opened a few days ago so we nipped in to take advantage of their by one/get one free offer. I'm ashamed to say we actually went twice in one afternoon!

We were pleasantly surprised. Being frequent patrons of Tea Shop 168 (I know, I know, it's the Mickey D's of bbt), the quality was much higher than what we're used to. The first time around I tried the passion fruit green tea and it was great. I didn't get the tapioca (I was still working on some egg waffles from Dragon City) but I can attest to the flavour, which was fruity without losing that really strong BAM taste of a great tea. They also threw in a slice of orange, which was a cute touch. 

My boyfriend had the classic milk tea with pearls. The best thing about this place is that you can adjust the amount of ice and sugar. He had full sugar, no ice. It was good, but got a little bit too sweet torwards the end. On the way home I got the classic with pearls and knocked the sugar down to just 80%. Definitely an improvement, but I think I could go to 50% easily. Below that, it might be a wee bit too bland. Other than that, it was pretty good. My classic definitely tasted a little bit grainy, so be sure to shake it up really well before you poke the seal with the straw.

The only thing that stops this being a five-star place for bubble tea is the pricing. Depending on what size you order (regular or large) and what kind of drink you want, you're looking at between $4 and $5 per drink. So definitely more in line with Ten Ren when it comes to quality and pricing. Ten Ren does one-up Chatime when it comes to tea-alternatives. While Ten Ren and Tea Shop do a lot of shushies and smoothies, your options for this kind of fare at Chatime are more limited. They still do it, but not to the extent some other places do."}
{"text":"I am hooked! So good! I get the chatime milk tea with tapioca pearls on the bottom and I am addicted to it! Everything is so good and fresh. There is always a line...and a wait. I have come to realize that is because the quality is so good compared to other bubble tea shops in the area. I tried on across the street and it was not good. Had an aftertaste. Blah. I am forever loyal to chatime now. I will wait in line because it is the best."}
{"text":"I'm mostly used to getting bubble tea of the green tea and fruit-flavoured powder variety found in places like Tea Shop 168, Go For Tea, E Tea and the like. Chatime offers a pleasant departure from the typical offerings of the other establishments in the area, although I didn't venture too far off the map with my order - a vanilla-flavoured milk tea. I found it to be more natural tasting and it had a more strong taste of tea than usual. If you're looking for something a little bit different in the Chinatown/Dundas Square area then Chatime is worth a shot."}
{"text":"I ordered the roasted tea with grass jelly and Tapioca. Very good and refreshing! The drink was a definite Five star. I gave this shop a 1 star because of the cookie and the macaron I bought. The macaron tasted very old and stale. The cookie was very soggy. I would suggest just to go buy there drinks, anything else you see for sale stay away."}
{"text":"When I came to Toronto, I was very happy to find out that Chatime had outlets here. It's very good and is similar to what I've had back home. I always get the milk tea, and it's still as good as ever.

However, I have increasingly found better-priced alternatives such as Bubble Tease which is just across the street. The lines for Chatime can get really long and the Dundas location is cramped and crowded. The workers are fast and efficient but it still takes a while to get my milk tea. I think they are understaffed. 

Bottom line - I still love the milk tea but because of price and long lines, I find myself going to other bubble tea places."}
{"text":"great service.
long lines but its worth it.

favorite : roasted milk tea.
their grass jelly is much better than other places too.
- love of all time!"}
{"text":"A nice lil tea place. Visited mostly by university students 
Quality & pricing - decent 
A friend of mine is obsessed with this place. 
My fav is taro bubble tea  
Convenient location."}
{"text":"I don't really get the hype. Having moved to Toronto earlier this year, I have been hoping to find my go-to bubble tea place and this isn't it. I've been here a couple times with friends, and I've had their regular milk tea,  roasted milk tea and fruit slush.

I'd stay away from the fruit slush, as since I've had fresh fruit slushes, powdered just doesn't cut it. And chatime is known for their tea based drinks. Their roasted milk tea was okay, but really nothing special. However, their regular milk tea was pretty gross imo. I hate throwing food away but I couldn't finish it. I had the tea with no sugar but there was this cloying flavour that was pretty unappetizing. 

I'll be back if other people want to go, but it's definitely not somewhere I'd choose for my bubble tea fix."}
{"text":"Made my first visit here after a movie with some of my coworkers and was not amazed with my first experience. This place is extremely busy, so it took a while before we were able to take an order. We were very confused with the system of how the drinks are ordered, which we came out with drinks that we were not too impressed with. The woman taking our order wasn't clear when she was asking about how we wanted our drink to be made. DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE YOU GO, THE WORKERS THERE DOES NOT EXPLAIN THE CONCEPT OF THIS BUBBLE TEA PLACE.

Our orders included:

Fairy Vanilla Bubble Tea, little ice, no tapioca (I was so confused why my drink didn't have any tapioca)

Taro Smoothie, with no sugar, tapioca (which my friend didn't even know the lady behind the counter even asked)

Pearl Milk Tea, with no ice, tapioca

All these drinks were far from what we wanted. Now that we finally discovered how the concept of ordering is supposedly run, we are planning to give chatime another chance. I will be back with an update once we do get a chance to go again!"}
{"text":"Has anyone else experienced watered down drinks especially at night?

I had a very disappointing experience at Chatime132 Dundas W location last night. I was there at 10pm and I ordered my usual large Taro Milk Tea with pearl, no ice, normal sugar. I get this drink at least once a week (usually after class around 6pm on most days) and I have always been happy with it. But last night it tasted like water. There was little to no flavour. I've had this drink numerous times and it has never tasted like this. I wanted to say something but it was very busy and there was a long line up so I didn't want to make a fuss in front of everyone. I understand that when it is busy then mistakes can happen, but as a customer, I feel very disappointed and slightly cheated to have paid $6 for a drink that essentially tasted like water with the slightest little bit of milk powder. It actually tasted like 1/4 of how the drink is suppose to taste like with 3/4 water added to fill it into a large cup. 

I had a similar experience last month when I went to Chatime around 10pm after dinner. I ordered some matcha drink (can't remember the name because I never wanted to order it again) which also tasted like water with the littlest hint of green tea flavour. At the time I thought maybe this drink was just inherently bad, but now I think that if I had ordered it at an earlier time with someone who actually knows how to make it properly then it might actually be a delicious drink.

Bottom line: I love Chatime but their lack of quality control and consistency makes me very disappointed that I run the risk of paying $6 for an EXTREMELY watered down drink ever so often."}
{"text":"It's consistently decent here, which is a rare quality for bubble tea places. Also, the new flavours they get every month can make the whole experience very addictive.

I'm taking one star off for quality of ingredients, since I prefer having fresh fruits (taro, mango, coconut) but it tastes so good that oftentimes I don't really miss it.

They have other treats now (plain and chocolate-covered cronuts spotted the other day). Also wish this place wasn't always so busy, but I suppose that's a sign of success."}
{"text":"The truth of the matter is, the tea is weak. 

I don't get the high I usually do when dealing with properly brewed tea in the right concentration. I.e. This tea unfortunately  does not cause me to bounce off the walls, talk really loudly, and surf the net for pictures of food that make me hungry.

The fragrance of Jasmine in the tea is greatly lacking, and it is hard to pick up any of the tannins in the brew. Their drinks are generally okay, but not over the top amazing.

I do appreciate the customizability of the BBT i.e. Levels of Ice, Sugar, etc. However, I prefer Green Grotto on the east end.

Not my favourite, but it is the best place downtown that I've come across for this Taiwanese specialty."}
{"text":"Brown rice green milk tea - DONE. 

Four stars because of selection and ability to customize ice and sweetness. Love that you can get a bigger size."}
{"text":"It's great but lot's of people waiting. If taste of milk is more heavy will be better."}
{"text":"We all know bubble tea isn't exactly health food but Chatime's milk teas are made with non-dairy creamer, which often contain corn syrup and some other pretty awful ingredients and may be loaded with trans fats. The company didn't respond when I asked whether the type they used contained trans fat, so drink at your own peril. 

That said, if you're not the kind of person who cares about that sort of thing, I enjoyed the roasted milk tea (tapioca, no sugar, no ice) before finding out about the non-dairy creamer. 

I've also had the straight brewed oolong (no sugar) and found it to be oversteeped and astringent."}
{"text":"The restroom in this place was extremely dirty.  Dirty restroom usually means dirty kitchen.  They need more staff to maintain the place."}
{"text":"My husband is addicted to this place! I tried glass jelly for the first time since I was 10 years old! And..I love it. I used to hate it as a kid and didn't understand why anyone would eat this stuffs. But now,I can't get enough! Must be getting older and wiser...;)"}
{"text":"This is the only place i go to get bubble tea in Toronto, and trust me i've gone almost everywhere  in the city looking for a great bubble tea, these guys are busier then starbucks but there quick and good at what they do, they have line ups all the  time but because they work so well together  your not waiting long until your served. everything you can get is clearly listed and you can also make your own drinks and add what you like  and the best thing of all you  can control the sugar level of your drink, which i think is great health wise especially for people  who have to watch there sugar intake and what not  etc.."}
{"text":"I went to ChaTime to see what's all the hype about, ordered the milk tea with grass jelly and it was ok. It taste like any other chain bubble tea."}
{"text":"I have to bring down my rating because last time I was here I saw a  house centipede, scutigera coleoptrata crawling around on the floor behind the bar. This was rather sick. :(

We picked up our drinks and left promptly."}
{"text":"The Bay and Dundas location just renovated so it's a nice stop to enjoy bubbletea with friends or on your own. The servers are quick to get your order ready. 

I got the World Cup special which has a $5.00 and $5.30 option. I got the roasted milk tea with grass jelly in a gigantic 'world cup themed' cup (xxl size) for only $6 including tax. That is amaaazing!! Get it now. It's a limited time offer. 

This made my day even though I'm soaked from the rain and late going back to the office!"}
{"text":"One of the best location to order milk tea in the downtown area. This place is super packed that's when you know this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Saw this place open up a few weeks ago and have been pining to hit it up!

My order: Grass Jelly Roasted Green Milk Tea, Less Ice, 30% sugar.

I am a huge fan of their customization, they have a great system going for their personalization and compared to other places I have been to it definitely has them sticking out as a place to return too. The price point is average at $4.75 after tax. 

Will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Peace and bliss, striding down dusty Dundas all the way to the AGO on an 88-degree day slurping from my large Matcha Green Tea Smoothie with boba, (adjustable) 30% sweetness, succulent red bean bits and generous boba, more creamy than slushy and just icy enough, acknowledging with grace the longing looks of passersby."}
{"text":"Ordered a Taro milk tea here.. absolutely disgusting. So powdery I could taste clumps. It was like drinking sand. The only redeeming factor was the tapioca which was very chewy and well flavoured. I don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Simply put: ADDICTIVE!!! What do they put in these things? Crack? Its bubble tea is like no other. Has a distinctive fragrance and sweetness. As well you can customize your level of sweetness. And like most other bubble tea shops you can also have your choice of tapioca balls, jellies, pudding, etc. Be warned once you try one, you'll be ruined for other bubble tea shops."}
{"text":"As a milk tea fan, I can tell you this is probably the best milk tea place you can find in downtown Toronto. My favourite!"}
{"text":"I've tried going to this place so many times in the past on the weekends and it's always so packed, I didn't want to wait in line.

I finally got to try it last night and I wasn't disappointed. 

I ordered the Taro Bubble tea and it was so good! It had bits of mashed taro in it so it was like drinking a tea-taro shake!

I love the customization of toppings, ice, and sugar level. I hate drinks that are too sweet so I always try to order with minimal sugar.

The tapioca pearls were nice and chewy. I didn't finish it so I kept it in the fridge (it says on the cup to consumer within 2 hours for best taste, but I never follow instructions anyway) for this morning. Pearls were still"}
{"text":"This is my third Chatime after Northyork centre and St.George. Chatime at Dundas opened at 11:00am. They do not sell bread and pastries. They have good size seats and tables and seats are comfortable. I ordered Taro milk tea at all of three shops. Northyork centre gave me hot tea, but other two shops, they did not give really hot tea. I ordered hot tea but it was not hot. Until I went to Chatime at Dundas, I did not know people who serve tea are called \"tearista.\" It was interesting."}
{"text":"I've come here 5 times, and 4 times they got my drink wrong. All I ask for is a Peach green tea with tapioca and they never get it right. I've gotten oolong tea twice, jasmine tea once and they gave me passion fruit the last time. Every other bubble tea establishment does not make that mistake but I guess it's cause everyone who works there is a FOB and can barely speak English.

This place is pretty much the same as 168. Go somewhere else and save your money."}
{"text":"After frequenting many different bubble tea shops, I feel that Chattime is definitely the best. It may be more of take out place, but the tea is excellent quality. Their milk teas are better than any other tea shop I have been to. The tea tastes very fresh and I like that they have a good variety and allow you to customize the ice and sugar level.

The only thing that would make Chattime better is if they provided more seating so I could sit an enjoy the tea there."}

I've been drinking bbtea for at least last 12 years of my life, and that is A LOT of bbtea and pearls. Without a doubt, I know my bbtea and how it's suppose to be done. I have long list of different flavors that I've enjoyed in the past that includes taro smoothie, green milktea, coconut milk tea, honey green tea, lychee smoothie. 

When I moved to TO, I wasn't even expecting to find good bbtea here because I was already aware of the fact that it's not very popular in eastcoast. Plus I tried green milk tea at Ten Ren (Chinatown) prior to and it was so horrible that I've fallen into bbtea funk. 

However, seeing that Chatime has finally opened- I couldn't pass by without trying and I am glad that I dropped by. It's just like typical bbtea joints, drink station at the front and tables at the back. Because they only opened a day or two before I dropped by, the seating area was pretty much empty. There were 4-5 people working at the store, still busy setting up their kitchen. 

There are many options you can choose from: Milktea, Freshtea, QQ Jelly, Poptea, Coffee, Smoothie and Healthy Series.

Ordered: ICED MILK TEA WITH PEARLS: You think that milktea is something so simple they can't mess it up? You are wrong. I've been to so many bbtea places where they screw this up. But at Chatime, it was PERFECT. It was made just the way it's suppose to be with the right amount of sweetness. Make sure to ask for half pearl if you don't want too much of it in your drink. When they make milktea right, you know other drinks will taste just fine.

Ordered: MATCHA RED BEAN SMOOTHIE: My mom orders this everytime we go for bbtea. If you love matcha and if you love red bean, you will love this drink. It's basically a ice cream smoothie and you can't really go wrong with this order. She found it to be a little too sweet but you can choose the sweetness of drinks so make sure to ask before they make it.

I am just wondering if they have stamp cards so you can purchase certain # of drinks and get a drink for free?

For the opening special, they are giving out free upgrade to large size even when you order a regular size (cold drinks only) so make sure to drop by before the offer ends. 

Summary: ChaTime reminds me of those bbtea joints back in Vancouver. I will def be back later to try my next fav bbtea flavor, iced honey green tea!!"}
{"text":"Busy location with an awfully long line up but worth it over those other bubble tea shops. Highly recommend the grass jelly with roasted milk tea, half sweet, less ice"}
{"text":"Holy Moly, the line up was all the way out the door! 

This place must be amazing if people are willing to line up in the cold, so I quickly got in line as well. 

I tried the Grass Jelly Roasted Milk Tea and the Fairy Vanilla Milk Tea, and both were amazing! Not too sweet and the tapioca was perfectly cooked. The milk tea wasn't overly creamy or too watery - everything was just right! 

The ladies behind the counter were Taiwanese, and were very friendly. This place is one of the most authentic bubble tea places I've been to in the GTA. Say goodbye to TenRen and 168! 

The bubble tea can be pricier than other places, but it's definitely worth it. They have locations worldwide, with headquarters in Taiwan! 

I wish they opened a location uptown.."}
{"text":"Genius idea to let customers control the amount of ice and sugar in their tea.

Maybe I'm so behind on bubble tea culture, but I thought this was amazing. I really appreciated the control of not having overly sweet bubble tea."}
{"text":"the product is still the same but i find this location slower than some others. maybe have more staff on hand?"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place for bubble tea.
No other tea shop compares. 

I always make a stop at this location when in Dundas area.

The store is small so good for take out.

There is long line up all the time but worthy to wait.

The price of the milk tea wasn't expensive. You will love their taro milk tea.

And surprisingly their coffee drink quality was so good, too."}
{"text":"The tea and service is good. from the time Chatime first opened in Toronto to now, thier drinks have always been made with the same tastes. Considering the number of people that come here, the service is quite quick which is appreciated. 

Be warned though that the lines are brutal at times (it's calmed down now). And when they are, the structure of the restaurant is not made well to consider such a rush so it gets pretty hot waiting and sometimes frustrating. Good though when it does get busy, I find people never bud (from my experience at least).  

There is a number of seats, mostly smaller tables, so if it's busy or you are a big group it'll be hard to get a seat."}
{"text":"love this place....so addicted to their drinks...the best bubble tea in the GTA ..
Always go for their original Chatime pearl milk tea...."}
{"text":"I always get #2 Roasted Milk Tea with Grass Jelly, no sugar no ice.
Standard bubble tea price (expensive), standard taste.
Nothing too special, but not bad.
Long line up most of the time.
The place is very small, with some seating, it can be very crowded."}
{"text":"My friends and I were definitely hitting boba up before we left Toronto, and we stopped by Chatime towards the end of the day. Phew, there was quite a wait (generally a good sign!). I got lychee tea with boba and lychee jelly and it was quite good - good tea, good boba. Worth a stop if you're in the neighborhood for sure!"}
{"text":"Hey it's Chatime, enough said. The fact that it spawned a street full of me too competitors on Dundas while this place remains the gold standard says something about this place. 

Having been used to the newer Markham location, I stopped by to do a comparison. The store feels older, and it shows with a harder to read menu and more dated decor, but the bbt and service is the same as always. Gold standard drinks for me remains the red bean milk tea and grass jelly roasted milk tea. 

It's funny that in a very Canadian street like Dundas, you would see the very Asian trend of different BBT shops popping up nearby, with shops trying to outdo one another selling a specialized product. But it's a welcome addition to the neighbourhood and I would like to try the other places nearby as well."}
{"text":"This location isn't as good as some of the others. For one, it could be cleaner. Also, the cashiers could be nicer. The woman taking orders that night was not friendly, but perhaps she was having a rare off night. I had the grass jelly roasted milk tea, which was great. However, I'd still recommend their taro milk teas over it."}
{"text":"- neat flavours
- average prices
- open til 12 near dundas square
- strong tea taste
- yummy!
- nice interior design
- don't have many or any fruit flavours for their milk tea"}
{"text":"Been going for a long time. Good selection of bubble tea, but generally has long lines throughout the day. If you a loyal member, I recommend getting a Vicinity Loyalty Card for Chatime."}
{"text":"They have the best pearl milk tea in town. Honestly.
However everyone seems to know that so every time I'm at Chatime there is an extremely long line up - I've usually had to wait at least 15 minutes for my drink. The employees work fast, but they're just really popular."}
{"text":"Chatime is sooooo good. My favorite is the Brown Rice Green Milk Tea with Grass Jelly (regular sugar). It has a really distinct and unique taste that I seem to always crave now. They also accommodate for people that don't like as sugary drinks or too much ice so you can order your drinks with 50% sugar or 0 sugar added. The taste is really authentic. It typically costs about $4 - $6 for a drink which is pretty normal for bubbletea. I've also had the Passion Fruit QQ (I think it had lychee jelly and tapioca in it) which I think would be great for the summer because it's really fruity and also the Matcha Red Bean one, which was also really good! 

It also has Wifi and is open pretty late (I believe until midnight)."}
{"text":"I only go here because it's close to my work but I know there are better bubble tea places elsewhere. I always get the red bean with tapioca, which has been consistent but that's about the only good thing I have to say about this place. I'm giving this place a two because of how horrible the service is. They only half listen to what you say and half the time they got my order wrong. I remember one time the cashier took someone else's order before mine even though she wasn't even in line. I can only congratulate them for their lack of consideration for me as a paying customer and for their ability to truly not care whether you leave happy or not."}
{"text":"This tea place reminded me of Taiwan. 

They offered free wifi! There are plenty of chairs and tables. 

I ordered red bean milk tea with boba and roasted milk tea with boba. The boba is chewy but not too sweet. Roasted milk tea is my favorite. It has fresh leaf taste and I bet it is not made from powder. You are customized your drink for its sugar content and the amount of ice you want to have in your drinks.

I would definitely recommend this boba place in Toronto. I will definitely come back again for another boba tea in the near future"}
{"text":"Passed by this place on the way home during their grand opening and been back a few times since. By far the best tasting bbt I've had in the area. Has good tea flavour and even their matcha drinks actually taste like it (pet peeve when I order \"green tea matcha\" anything and tastes nothing like matcha). 

I have tried the matcha milk tea, reg. milk tea and  the green tea yoghurt. All of which was delicious. Only con is the price compared to other shops (avg. $5) 

I usually get 30% sugar with no ice. Found 100% much too sweet for my liking. Friendly staff and always fast service."}
{"text":"I think it's great that they allow you to customize your drink. I like to get 30% sugar, less ice. The selection of drinks flavors availability can satisfy anyone's preferences. Great price too!

Negative factor: long line up and I found the taro milk tea to be very chalky. Probably wont be getting that flavor again."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Chatime!

My favourite thing about this Dundas location is that the staff are super quick at taking your order and making drinks. The lines are always long around meal time and post-meal time but I never had to wait for too long to get my drink.

Top flavours in my opinion have got to be the milk teas. Roasted milk tea, brown rice green tea, caramel milk tea, taro milk tea, all are my frequent options because so much flavour is packed in in one drink. I tried the fruit ones before but it tasted very generic artificial like other bubble tea shops.

Chatime is awesome for letting you choose the ice and sugar level. I don't like my drink too cold or sweet so I always ask for less sugar and no ice. 

TIP: Don't forget to ask for a stamp card if you don't have one already! I know that once you check out Chatime you'll be going back for more."}
{"text":"Woohoo, this place is quite good and their drinks are amazingly consistent. I've been to a few different branches in Toronto, and one in London (UK) and their drinks were all the same. Although be weary of the line if you are coming sometime during in the evenings as this place can get quite packed. You can choose various levels of sweetness as well as the amount of ice in your drinks, so customize to your heart's content. Their tapiocas are also soft and sweet, yumm. 

My Fav is the mango QQ, it's got a good mix of goodies along with the fruit drank. Give it a shot if you aren't in the mood for a milk tea!"}
{"text":"Bubble tea has boomed in the Western culture over the years. I have been to a variety of bubble tea places but cha time is my favorite. Once you go here, you will never want to go to another. It's customizable options are great if you are very picky. From half sugar, no sugar, less ice, extra tapioca, and so on. They have opened up many locations, but my two favourites are at Finch and Richmond Hill. 

Here we ordered the mango green tea, less sugar, half ice. It was good but not as good as the other two locations. I do give it a thumps up for efficiency, speed, and cost!You should try there top 10 best sellers. You are bound to like one or more of them. My all time favourite is the grass jelly roasted milk tea, less ice, half sugar. Though sometimes I opt for less ice, and less sugar. It depends how I feel. Either way, it is tasty!

It might seem rediculous to write paragraphs  and paragraphs about bubble tea, but it is \"a cult.\" A cult for boba (aka bubble tea term) enthusiasts. Be adventurous with flavors! That is the only way to know what you like and don't like!

\"Boba for one, boba for all!\""}
{"text":"A basic BBT shop to grab from 

Some nice pluses are the ability to custom how much sugar and ice go into the drink. 
They also label the drinks with all the details of your custom. 
This was pretty nice to make sure you received the right order and handy if you order multiples."}
{"text":"Si tu l'as jamais essayé le Bubble tea, cette fameuse boisson avec des boules de tapioca gélatineuse au fond, c'est là qu'il faut se rendre. Le choix des boissons est énorme donc n'hésitez pas à demander conseil!

// If you never tried Bubble Tea this is the place to go. The choices of drinks is enormous so don't hesitate to ask for advices!"}
{"text":"I was not a fan of Chatime last year and went off around downtown looking for a go-to bubbletea shop and alas, gave Chatime another try and must withdraw my previous review. I have been back several times in the last few weeks and my drink has been consistent every time :) Best pearls in the city, always perfectly sweetened and cooked. 

I stuck with their Chatime Pearl Milk Tea (Large $4.70) with no ice, 30% sugar. Wasn't watery like how I had it several times last year and the sugar doesn't overpower the tea flavour. The no ice option is great to have a cold drink without having the ice eventually dilute your entire drink. Today  I wanted to add coconut jelly for an extra 50 cents and didn't see there's an option for that! But the girl taking my order changed it to \"QQ Milk Tea\" for me, which has both tapioca pearls and coconut jelly, and it was still the same price at $4.70 for a large!! Amazing discovery for me. 

The wait can be long and stuffy but the staff are efficient.

Also, get a Vicinity points card and you can get a free birthday regular drink."}
{"text":"Good bubble tea, but quite expensive but its worth it! There always seems to be a line up and it was moving fast! Good service and good Bubble Tea! I'm coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"The staff in this branch is SO BAD with customer service and frankly needs some common sense.

We arrived early downtown today  and decided to go to Chatime to claim the birthday offer. Chatime opens at 11AM but we arrived 10:50am, so we wait the 10 minutes. 11pm arrived and the doors are not yet open. 5 minutes passed, another lady arrives (who we thought was trying to cut in front of us) and knocks on the door. The lady inside opens the door to let her in and finally opens the door. It turns out the lady who knocked on the door also works there.

We go to the cashier to meet an unhappy looking lady who looked like she didn't want to be working this morning. I tell her I'm claiming a birthday drink. She tells me to scan my card, and then tells me that I don't have one. I say it's my birthday, and I got the offer last year. I'm registered for Chatime rewards.

She asks if I received any email or text, and I say no but I thought it will be automatically in the card already since I received it last year. She says I need to register my account to get the birthday drink. I said I am already registered - that's why I received the birthday offer last year. She says I need to register it AGAIN. I'm like: Why do I need to register my birthday again? Do I need to register my birthday every year? It doesn't make any sense! She tells me I need to register my account again to trigger the Birthday offer. I'm like: My account is registered. That's why I got my reward last year. She says I need to do it again for the birthday offer. I ask how do I register? And today is my Birthday so if I register again, will I still get that offer then? She says I register in the Chatime website and there is a plus and minus 7 days since you register for the Birthday offer to trigger.

Disappointed and weirded out by these instructions, I check Chatime rewards website to try to Register. But all I find is the FAQ which said: Members will receive a text message from Vicinity on behalf of Chatime Rewards prompting you to tell us when your birthday is. Didn't receive the text message from us? Don't worry, simply login to your Vicinity account (http://www.vicinityrewards.ca) to edit your profile. You must register your date of birth at least 7 days prior to the actual day of your birthday.

This lady clearly doesn't know what she's talking about. I need to register at least 7 days before. There's no plus 7 days of registering to get the birthday offer. And also, nowhere does it say I need to register every year.

I check my profile in VicinityRewards.ca. My birthday is there as it should since I received the birthday drink last year. I go back to tell her that Chatime Rewards simply states that I have my birthday in Vicinity and that I verified my Vicinity profile and my birthday is there.

This is where I get pissed as she replies: You need to register your birthday AGAIN. At this point, I'm furious by how stupid this is. I ask: How do you want me to register my birthday AGAIN, when my birthday is already there? It doesn't make sense that I have to register my birthday every year to get the birthday offer.

And then she just responds saying she doesn't know and, if I have any issues, I should contact customer service.

I am so furious about what just happened as I cannot wrap my head around the stupid misinformation I was being told."}
{"text":"Frequented by U of T students, this bubble tea shop offers great bubble tea at a reasonable price. However, it would not be uncommon for you to be waiting in line for over 10 minutes. Chatime has the second best bubble tea in Toronto 
(although its front door boasts the best bubble tea in the world), falling just short of Ten Ren's elite standard. Nevertheless, their flavours taste suspiciously similar."}
{"text":"My asian compadres set me onto this hidden gem on Dundas street. We've been here around 3-4 times together. The drinks are good, they have a good variety, and you can choose how much sugar to add and what stuff to mix into the drink. Some of the best bubble tea I've had in town. I like the smoothies they have there and the drinks are priced on par with other similar shops. They also have some bizarre quotes on the wall, which I enjoy. 

The downside is that the shop is small, has limited seating and is always very busy right up until they close and kick everyone out. I've never been in there when there has been less than 10 people in front of me in line and no more than one table free."}
{"text":"This place is overrated. I had the taro bubble tea and i only have one word to describe it...awful."}
{"text":"??????????Grass Jelly Milk Tea???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????10??????????????Grass Jelly Roasted Milk Tea????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Pure squishy bliss. Best bubble tea place I've been to. Great location right off Yonge street. 

SO many flavors... so so soooo many that it's overwhelming. Love that you're encouraged to customize your drink with toppings and amount of sugar. 

Tapioca pearls were excellent. Perfect amount of squish and chewiness. We ordered the slush, teas, milk teas, and coffee all with the pearls. SO GOOD. 

Long lines, but they're really efficient and you get your drink right away!"}
{"text":"I caved.  

I refused to purchase bubble tea just out of principle.  I drank bubble tea practically every single day in Taiwan at only a dollar per drink and they were 5 star quality each and every time.  

I kept hearing, Chatime is so good, Chatime is the best...  There are also 10 people in line at any given time.  Why is that?

I ordered a large roasted milk tea with tapioca.  Less sugar, less ice.  Damn, that was pretty good.  $5 and change good?  Once in awhile, I guess so.  I even picked up a frequent buyer's card just for the heck of it."}
{"text":"There is a lot of hype surrounding this place and you'll have to line up for at least 15-20 minutes on a busy day if you want your bubble tea fix.   The vibe is quite loud due to how busy the place is and there is little to no seating available inside.  You'll have to wait around for a seat or simply order take out to enjoy your drink. 

I usually order #2 special for my gf and I usually get a taro or honey dew slush for myself.  The ability to choose your sweetness level is definitely a first for bubble tea shops in Toronto so that was a nice touch.  The tea and milk tea drinks are good, but the slush drinks seem to be just like any other bubble tea shop around town.

Overall I don't mind coming here if the line up is short, but waiting in line for over 20 minutes for a bubble tea just isn't worth it to me in my opinion."}
{"text":"10pm quick fix was satisfied with a taro milk tea with added bubbles and coconut jelly.  The service was quick.  There's a bit of line but it moved pretty quick.  The tables all around was nice to just chill in.  The menu is quite large and there are so many options for all flavors and customizations."}
{"text":"The line up, which can sometimes go all the way to the back of the store and wrap back towards the entrance, can get a bit unruly during rush hour, but for bubble tea addicts like me, Chatime is a staple. They offer a good amount of variety which includes all the popular ones, like taro and roasted milk tea. However, the menu lacks some of the more \"out there\" or unique flavours that one would find at Presotea or Bubble Republic. 

Like most bubble tea places, you can customize your drink. I always recommend no sugar and either less ice or no ice altogether. This keeps the original flavour without watering it down or making it overly sweet.

The loyalty program at Chatime is a nice bonus and it's worth getting the free card if you think you'll be back in the future. There's also the TOTM (tea of the month) monthly promotion, which is the perfect way to try new flavours at a discount. Another thing that sets Chatime apart is that they have a lot of seasonal drinks offered for a limited time. This helps add some variety to the menu.

Overall, Chatime is worth a visit. The prices fall in line with a lot of the bubble tea places I've been to (roughly $5 for a regular with add-ons like tapioca, grass jelly, etc), the menu is predictable but extensive, and the additional incentives gives you a reason to come back."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty bubble tea place. It didn't get 5 stars because the ambiance is not as nice as the huge places in Markham.  But for taste it's really good. I had the QQ Taiwan mango juice 80 % sweet"}
{"text":"Minus the long line (it does move fast) every thing was crafted perfectly, not ur run of the mill bubble tea spot, more quality and effort goes into every drink and the price isn't so bad (around 5$) u can pick how much ice, sugar u get in ur drink! I found it super refreshing and worth the wait!! Glad to see them in Canada!"}
{"text":"I literally came here every night that I was in Toronto because everything I tried was good! Milk tea with boba, milk tea with red bean, green tea with boba, taro with boba, taro with jelly..honestly don't even get me started with taro. I love taro bubble tea but refrain from ordering it since most places use powder, however, this was not the case. They use fresh taro (the gritty texture is from the taro not powder) here and it is bombbbb.com (not sure if it's a saying in Canada but it is in the states)!"}
{"text":"I was happy I'd had bubble tea before, because if you are bubble tea virgin, this place will confuse the heck out of you.  THERE ARE SO MANY CHOICES -- with very little explanation or guidance.   There was a consistent line-up the entire time we were there (about 2 1/2 hours), but there were always seats available.

I went with the thing I was most confused by, because I figured that was the way to go.  Longan and date juice with rainbow jelly.  I asked for 30% sugar and she said to go with 50% sugar, but I wish I had trusted my gut, I didn't need that added sugar it was fine. 

The actual atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired (which is why most people, I guess, are just doing take-out).  Bathrooms were gross.  I would go back, maybe once more in the summer, but just to take-out if I was going for a stroll.  (Remember when it was nice enough outside to stroll?)"}
{"text":"They put cocaine in their bubble tea! They have to because it taste so good. I've had many bubble teas before and never really liked it but for some reason they have a secret formula in it to make it taste so gooood.!

{"text":"Not much more to say about it.  If you're craving bubble tea in Toronto, this probably has the best in the core.  I believe Chatime started in Taiwan and has finally made it's way to Toronto.  They have a lot of options you can add to you drink and will make it right in front of you.  I'd like to think they use less artificial flavours (probably not).  Service is fast, and it will be rare you will walk in there without a small line formed."}
{"text":"Sometimes a long wait but always worth it. I recommend getting passion fruit green tea and oolong milk tea."}
{"text":"Just about any Bubble Tea concoction that you can imagine! The prices are a bit higher than everyone else but there was still a good 20 minute line... I took it as a good sign and it was so worth it! Macha with red beans blended right in... amazing!"}
{"text":"i want to give it a 4.5 because I would like to say sometimes the bubble tea makers make the difference, sometimes the guy will make it perfect the way i like it and other times there's different people who make it differently, either way, they are happy to fix my drinks

hey it's not expensive and i acually like their bubble tea's and they are worth the 5 bucks for me atleast because i like the red bean match flavoured smoothie/slushie. IT CAN GET REALLY PACKED THOUGH. but the wait in line was worth it, i wonder if this place has loyalty cards or something, I wish there was more area for you to sit and chill with larger groups of friends. this place can feel really cramed to chill especially when its crowded and the tables being finiky. OVERALL THANKYOU FOR THE GREAT BUBBLE TEA"}
{"text":"Less or no sugar options are the best. Regular sugar is too sweet for their milk tea. Good Internet connection. Good place for catching up with friends. Love their wall decoration!!"}
{"text":"There was a hair in my bubble tea. A long one.

First off, kudos to the man in the corner, probably unfamiliar with Chatime, who ordered a coffee. He is the only person I've ever seen order a hot coffee in any bubble tea place.

I hope his coffee didn't have hair in it. Because my bubble tea did. I was halfway through my drink and nowhere near Chatime by the time I discovered a disgusting texture in my mouth. I wasn't going to walk back, so I emailed them and never heard back.

Chatime is already overpriced and I only indulge infrequently. I never really realized until I went to redeem my free Vicinity birthday drink, how strange it is for tapioca to be an extra charge. Regardless of how they position themselves, they are, to the core, a bubble tea business. Charging extra for tapioca is like Menchie's charging extra for flavour in your frozen yogurt or Gap charging extra for buttons on your shirt. The essence of these types of drinks (if we try to avoid the loaded term \"bubble tea\") is a cold beverage with tapioca. That's not to say you have to have tapioca, but \"with tapioca\" should be the default, quite frankly. 

This is also just me, but I also think a free drink should be all-inclusive. It seems in poor taste to do otherwise, perhaps like a burger joint giving me a free burger that only consists of a bun and a patty, all toppings extra. I'm grateful for the free drink, but this just goes back to my thoughts on bubble tea having tapioca as a default.

At least to this location, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good tea! 

My friends and I stopped in here for some post-dinner bubble tea. Overall, they are very accommodating to their guests as they offer different levels+amounts of sweetness, ice, bubbles, and other things. Options galore!

Despite my very picky Portlandia moment (\"could I have just a few bubbles? Less than that... maybe a little less than that... ok thanks!\" \"ok...maybe a little less ice...\"), the servers were very understanding. I had a ginger tea that was REALLY good. The bubbles were pretty chewy, but I didn't mind that as much.

Chatime also has some great magazines. It was fun to read some Asian magazines and comment on fashion + outfits. Overall, we had a great time here."}
{"text":"Due to the way the floor-plan is arranged, combined with there being constant streams of people coming in, getting in and out would be an interesting experience.

Orders are taken on your left up at the front, with the line extending towards the back. On your right is a row of tables along the wall. So you're basically making your way to the back, squeezing past all the people that are waiting in line..

Probably don't expect to find a seat during evenings. Atrium on Bay is just around the corner if you need somewhere to sit. This location doesn't appear to do uber eats, which is a good thing because the lines would probably be going out the door.

They don't take tap, so that may be a bit of a bottleneck during payment processing..

One thing that I've noticed is that the drinks are served up relatively quickly. Sometimes, it's so fast that once you're done paying the drink is already there for pick-up."}
{"text":"I love cha time! I got the roasted milk tea with grass jelly this time as the waitress highly recommended. Although I didn't like it as much as the tapioca I normally like, but it did satisfy my addiction to this place. The reason I like tapioca is that it gives it texture and something to bite on! I love this place too much :("}
{"text":"Location: 132 Dundas Street W, Toronto, ON M5G 1C3
Price: $$
Service: ehh

This was the first Chatime place that I've been to. To be honest the first time was not the best. Since, the process of ordering the bubble tea was confusing. It was confusing because they allow you add how much sugar you want but then when you ask if it's already sweeten they would say yes as if it was only sugar you're tasting. However, when I got my original bubble tea it tasted so bland and gross even, though the server said it was sweeten already. So my recommendation for the original bubble tea is to get it 1 (milk: if you enjoy the tea taste more) and 2 (sugar: just the right about)- this portion is for a size small!

The second location I went to is on highway 7 at Commerce gate. This time they did not ask me about how much sugar... Odd
But my recommendation flavour at this location is passion fruit slushy! Soooo yummy.. 

Verdict: decent"}
{"text":"I had one godawful Taro Milk Tea that almost made me stop coming here, but their Pearl Milk Tea is beyond amazing and could never keep me away."}
{"text":"Simply the best for non artificial flavored bubble teas I have ever had!!!  I usually just get the pearl milk tea or the QQ Taiwan mango juice.  I love how you can customize the sugar and ice levels. I usually opt out on both since I find the drinks already sufficiently sweet enough and you get a few more sips without the ice.  Once you have bubble tea from Chatime you won't go back to any other place. They just can't  compare in terms of taste. If you want a cheaper bubble tea you'll be compromising on quality and taste and will probably end up with a sugar laden drink made with some powder or liquid mixture of synthetic flavours.  

I've been here on such a frequent basis that I've completed two stamp cards an counting!"}
{"text":"Very busy. Otherwise 5 stars. Tea is good, milk tea better. One of the best bubbles in the biz. 

Pass on the donuts, they are average not to mention having an odd hue to them. 

Grapefruit tea is ok, could use more juice. Winter melon and just plain old oolong and green teas are good."}
{"text":"The drinks are made just fine but this location is always SUPER PACKED and takes forever to get to the front of the line. Also, I was very upset that they didn't seal my drink properly.. I put it in a baggy for take out and a portion of my drink had leaked to the bottom of the bag by the time I got home, which made a huge mess!! First time this has happened to me at any bbt store and I've been to plenty.. Makes me skeptical of coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Taro milk tea is my favourite here!!! This chatime location is convenient for university students. I recommend getting the milk teas because they are delicious."}
{"text":"I loved this place!

This place had amazing Taro Milk Tea Boba. There were little taro bits in the drink, which was a nice surprise. The tapioca balls were perfectly chewy with just the right amount of sweetness. Plus you get to choose the sweetness level (I tried normal sugar one time and 50% sugar the next time) and the amount of ice (I went for less ice). 

Their standard Milk Tea Boba was also pretty good. 

They had a bunch of different options that I wish I had time to try....like the Chatime Red Bean Milk Tea and the Brown Rice Green Milk Tea.

The only downside is that prices are pretty steep. I paid $5.20 for a regular sized boba drink. My favorite place in SF costs $2.50...and it's pretty darn delicious."}
{"text":"I came back here a day after and got the same drink, QQ mango Taiwan juice with coconut jelly and pearls. This time I got no ice and 0% sugar and a large. This was much better. I would never get ice there again! And 0% sugar is perfect. Yum!!!!

HIGHLY RECOMMEND 0% sweet and No Ice!!! Large is the size I'm used to and a pretty good deal for the extra $! YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!! Oh and get their stamp card if you're a local. I need to try more drinks here!"}
{"text":"In the downtown core, this is hands down the best bubble tea place.

There is an extensive menu with lots of different flavours and variations (hot, cold, fruit teas, black teas, green teas, slushes, etc.).  What is also exceptionally amazing is the ability to dictate the level of sugar and ice in your drink (normal, more, less, zero, etc.).  This customization along with the variation allows you to order to your heart's content.

Depending on when you show up, be prepared to face a line out the door onto the sidewalk.  Due to its close proximity to Eaton Centre, Yonge/Dundas square, and Ryerson, you may face a long line.  The line does go relatively quickly (depending on the people in line in front of you).  The staff itself is awesome.  Great at taking orders and working efficiently - seriously, the bottleneck is almost always the customers.

My fave and usual order is the roasted milk tea with grass jelly and tapioca, but with bubble tea, it's truly \"as the heart desires\" and what you consider is \"awesome\" will depend on each person's individual tastes.

The pricing of Chatime is consistent with more premium pricing of places within the GTA such as bubble tea from Ten Ren on Highway 7 and not food courts across the city, but in my opinion, well worth what they are charging.  If you want $2-3 bubble tea, this is not the place for you.  If you're willing to spend $5-7 for quality bubble tea, this should hit the spot nicely.

ChaTime is so good I go out of my way to make special trips to get my fix of bubble tea in downtown Toronto.  This is somewhat major given my general laziness outside of work which pretty much only gets erased by killer awesome eats."}
{"text":"If you like the taste of candy  in your tea you'll like this place. Otherwise stick to ten rens if you enjoy delicious strong tea flavor.  I tried the roasted grass jelly milk tea with 30% sweetener- it was too milky and had no tea flavor.  Mango black tea regular sweetener is way too sweet also no tea flavor. It tastes like mango jelly candy.  Line up moves quickly.  Don't be intimidated."}
{"text":"I love the roasted milk tea w glass jelly that everyone recommends here! It's heavenly.

Can't wait to try out more flavours"}
{"text":"This is the location where it all started. They got me addicted to cha time!!! I never knew you could customised your order until I came here. I often hate that bbt taste way too sweet. I am so happy I found this place!! You can zero to 30% sugar - and they also have the grass jelly instead of the tapioca. Heaven!!!

They also opened up a lot more locations  up in the Richmond hill and Markham area. But I have to say, this is by far the beat location. They make it just perfect!"}
{"text":"I don't drink bubble tea, but I was in the neighbourhood with my cousin and she was craving it. She asserted that Chatime has the best bubble tea in Toronto. I have walked passed this place several times and I had thought it was an Internet cafe!

There was a massive line-up on a Thursday night with young people ready to order from an extensive drink menu. My cousin ordered the caramel milk tea, which she thoroughly enjoyed and I had the refreshing sugar cane juice.

There was too much ice in my drink and at $4.20 for a regular size, it was quite expensive. I asked for a small size, but I was given the regular. 

I haven't seen sugar cane juice widely available in Toronto, so having it here was a nice, unique treat!"}
{"text":"After all the hype I had to see what Chatime was all about.

Came here post-dinner and opted for the Green Tea Red Bean drink which is apparently THE drink to get.  Like that it wasn't overly sweet, but at almost $5 for a small, I think I'll opt for a slice of cheesecake instead.

Was it good?  No doubt, but a little on the $ side if you ask me.

I like the fact that you can choose how much sugar or ice you want so there is room for slight customization, but the wait is quite long.  I also don't like how they pre-measure their tapioca bubbles and store them in the fridge.  

I've read some Yelpers say that it is non-artificially flavoured but I still saw them scooping in powder?  

The place is rather small, so it's not a place to bring to go with your posse en tow."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

So many bubble tea options!

Seating is available and restrooms are in the back. We dropped by after lunch and it wasn't that packed. The employees weren't all that friendly and quite slow. The end result was a winner though. They really know how to fork out tasty bubble teas. 

Lots of tea and flavor options. You can create your own special: choose your tea or coffee, toppings, sweetness level and ice level. 

Decided to try the Strawberry Pudding Au Lait (Regular). It was sweet and had a natural strawberry flavor. Blended well.  A generous serving of pudding sits on the bottom. It was smooth and slightly sweet. Total came to $5.31 with tax. Definitely pricey, but a tasty treat indeed."}
{"text":"3.5 rating.

This I believe is the first chatime location before all the other ones started popping up. Lines fill up quickly at this location but I find the employees here are quite efficient so you get your drink in no time!"}
{"text":"Since it's a downtown location (and really close to Eaton center) it's no wonder it's always busy. Lineup all the way to the back and it was 3pm on a Saturday.

Ordered two roasted milk teas with grass jelly with less ice and half sugar. The ice was definitely more than what I expected; ended up tasting watered down at the end. It was more ice than I would get at the pacific mall or midland/finch locations. I'd rather get my fill from those other locations than here. There was, however, a good amount of grass jelly. 

If youve never tried chatime, you should. Especially the roasted milk tea and/or taro milk tea. 3/5 for this location."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite places I have been for bubble tea. They have a lot of cool options that you dont usually see elsewhere. The line up was long but moved pretty quickly, and there is very limited seating so I would recommend getting your drink and taking it to go instead of planning on sitting there.

I had the hazelnut milk tea with 50% sugar and it was honestly one of the best I've had. If you like nutella, you will definitely like that drink. I'd be tempted to get something else next time because they have so many options but it was so good that I'll probably just get the same thing again!"}
{"text":"Usually when we come here for bubble tea they get our orders right but for some reason today was terrible. First off the girl entered in regular size for the peach green tea she we asked for a large (later she fixed the problem without charge.) We also asked for tapioca but it was not entered in(it was not fixed.)

I asked for a large earl grey milk tea and when it was done we noticed my cup size was smaller than the fixed large peach green tea. I mentioned about the error and they seemed annoyed about it and that was a turn off.

But I still come for the addictive drinks!!"}
{"text":"Extremely busy store around lunch time. Service is quick. They err on the too sweet side when you order your drinks, so take that into consideration when they ask you how much sugar you want."}
{"text":"Really tasty milk tea. I get the grass jelly roasted milk tea or the grass jelly milk tea, depending on what I'm feeling.

The location is quite small and when I went, the line extended all the way to the end of the shop. However, the line moves at a decent pace so you don't have to wait too long.

The flavour is consistent with the Chatime in Waterloo."}
{"text":"Omg, the milk tea was gross. I don't know why people like Chatime's drinks! I came here with good expectations based on the four star rating, and good reviews. There was also line of ppl waiting to buy drinks inside the store too.

The regular boba milk tea had this cloying sweetness to it, something about the taste of the milk tea was off. I took some sips to try it out but couldn't keep drinking. The boba seemed normal but not especially well done.

Skip! I don't recommend!"}
{"text":"This seems like a popular chain in Toronto.  Every time I come here, there are about 10 people in line at all times no matter what time you go.  10 people when I walk in.   10 people when I walk out.  The shop is not very big but there are some seating available.  There are 3 different sizes you can get - regular, large and super cup.  I don't even know how you'd even hold the super cup since it's got girth.  You can also specify the amount of ice and sugar you want (more, less, etc).  

My favorite from here is the Taro smoothie with rainbow jelly.  A large of this will set you back about $5.50.  Pretty hefty for a drink, but seems to be the norm these days and it's pretty delicious.  They do load it with tons of jelly, though."}
{"text":"I'm partially to blame for this bad experience because \"new year, new me\" got me asking for no sugar and no ice in my QQ mango juice, which tasted like watered down mango syrup. Faintly sweet and seriously disappointing. At least he tapioca was good. 

There is always a line at this place, so take advantage of the free wifi at this place. There's limited seating, so I would rather take my drink to go. You also get to see some of their current offers after logging into their wifi if you're looking to save some money."}
{"text":"I got a large chatime milk tea with bubbles. No sugar no ice (cuz it's cold). Even though without the sugar, it tasted sweet. My guess is that they rinsed the bubbles in syrup. But anyway, the whole milk tea tasted good. I will come back and try something new next time."}
{"text":"There's ALWAYS a LONG line but the store smells really good. Service is prompt and price is average compared to all the other boba shops. The tapioca is really soft and chewy and it's just the right amount of sweet. The teas actually taste like tea and you can adjust the amount of ice and sugar according to your liking."}
{"text":"I come here probably every few months when I want to satisfy my bubble tea craving.

One of the first few locations in the downtown area, it's super convenience as it's close to my workplace, but also just a few steps from the Eaton Centre which puts it in a great spot.

The drinks here are quite consistent with the Chatime brand around Toronto so you're pretty much guaranteed consistency (at least from my experience).

Chatime back then was the #1 go-to bubble tea place, but with the recent uprising of other tea shops, there are definitely other great options around the neighbourhood. Still Chatime never fails to meet my expectations, and having a rewards system is always a nice perk for customers as well as the \"tea of the month\" specials.

This location is VERY cramped and tight, and sitting here can be pretty uncomfortable. Expect to grab your drank and sit in the Eaton Centre Eatery or something."}
{"text":"Chatime has created a new \"Bubble Tea Alley\" on Dundas St.  Now, there's a lot more options, including Latte Mei, that Kung Fu Place and Bubble Tease across the street.

I still come back to Chatime though, and that's because their drinks are still some of the best.  They really hit it out of the park with their interesting flavours, particularly their use of different types of teas.

The only downside is that after all this time, the lineups haven't improved.  The wait is highly variable; a short line can take 10 minutes or even 20 minutes depending on the crowd ahead of you.  For people who haven't been before, figuring out the ice and sugar levels can end up taking up a lot of time.

So usually Chatime is my go-to place but if the lineup is long, I head over to the Kung Fu place closer to University.  It has enough similarities that it's a great back-up.

Some Tips:
1) Sign up for the points card - it's free. If you download the app and sign up online, you get to add a free point (You get five, but you can only use one bonus point for each shop)
2) There's a lot of drinks not on the main menu, but on smaller pieces of paper around and near the cash"}
{"text":"Chatime has the best bubble tea I have ever Tasted and I've tried a lot. None of the flavours ever fail me unlike most places. I indulge in a chatime strawberry milk tea with pearl, no sugar and less ice, once a week. They need more locations!"}
{"text":"I've done extensive research on some of the best places in Toronto and in my own opinion, Chatime has the best bubble tea out there! It's refreshing and packs a ton of authentic flavour. My go-to bubble tea is the Chatime pearl milk tea, my ultimate fav and it is consistently good. I go to Chatime every single time I stopover in Toronto to head to another city because it's not only conveniently located near the bus terminal, but it's just always always so damn good. Not really a place to sit down and there's always a lineup, but it's worth it. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Loved this place so much I went 2 days in a row. The line is ALWAYS long...dont know how the people behind the counters keep up! 

The tapioca was perfect. The grass jelly delicious! didn't have time to try the pudding but everything was great. The first day I was there I got the Matcha green tea red bean smoothie..say that 5x..It was delish! I get regular sugar but it isn't overly sweet at all..

Next day was a grass jelly roasted milk tea...still dreaming about it today. I wonder if anyone ever orders the 32 oz..I would have ordered it had I not been so full but I could use one right now..It's worth the price and the wait in line."}
{"text":"Famous long line up so many drinks to choose from. First drink happened to be an odd selection, plain milk and grass jelly. Luck of the draw picked a randomly weird drink that wasnt enjoyable. It shouldnt even be on a bbt menu it contains no tea. Or my bf shouldnt have ordered that lol. Roasted milk tea ;)"}
{"text":"As I've said in my other reviews of different Chatime locations, I find Chatime to serve very consistent drinks at all stores. Especially with all the bubble tea competition, it's very impressive that they have managed to build such a successful global brand. With that being said, I crave bubble tea all the time, but I can go months without having a Chatime craving in particular.

This is a very small store right by Bay and Dundas, so it's constantly busy. You'll be lucky if you can find a place to sit - there's only about 10-15 chairs and maybe 6 or so tables. Their free wifi is their telephone number I believe, but I never stay long enough to need to connect to it. This location is extremely narrow! If I wanted to use their washroom at the back and there's a line, I would definitely have rub against people to get to the back because there's no space to move around. Luckily, the lines go by quite quickly.

I used to always order their taro until I found out that it was just powder (I thought it was real taro this whole time). Their strawberry milk tea is very delicious and it's different from what you would expect (more subtle hints of the sourness of real strawberry). The last time I came with a group of 4, we all ended up getting the roasted milk tea with grass jelly. I ordered a regular size, but the employee punched in a large (whatever, I was thirsty anyways so I didn't mind just paying the extra $.50). The large is more than enough! Prices are quite steep at $4.20 for a regular for most of the bubble tea options, and then $.50 extra for toppings or an upsize. I usually get grass jelly from chatime and I make it less sweet. However, Chatime is one of the places that doesn't make their drinks excessively sweet."}
{"text":"Chatime is my all time fav bubble tea joint. I LOVE IT!!! the waitress isnt too friendly but their bubble tea is soo good I can resist. It's my bubbletea crack. I especially love how chatime can customize your drink however you want. 0-100% sugar, less, med or a lot of ice and four the toppings (the most ive seen at bubble places) you can choose one or combine 2 if you want. They offer grass jelly, tapioca, aloe and pudding. 

The downfall about this location is that it's really small and there's always line ups."}
{"text":"As far as product is concern, this is by far the best bubble tea you can get in downtown Toronto which explains the premium pricing (4.20 for a small, 4.70 for a large and I believe 5.20 for the World Cup giant cup). Though I recommend the Chatime Roasted Milk tea, they have a huge variety to choose from.

From a service perspective, they are generally quick with the line (which can literally go into their washroom at times). It is uncommon to see this place without a line which makes me wish they had a bigger location. The fact that they renovated and added new wall decorations does not help as they did lose some space for standing in line or seating. 

They are also part of the vicinity loyalty program which doesn't seem to have much traction here. I honestly only use it for Chatime.

Other than that,  the huge lines and lack of space are the only bad things I can point out about  this place. It is the best bubble tea franchise in Toronto as of right now though I wish they would grab a bigger location (perhaps take over that Bubbletease across the street?)"}
{"text":"The BBT here is one of the best I've had in allllll of GTA including Rhill, etc.

Looks like they actually make their BBT with fresh ingredients instead of just powder, I believe their logo speaks of this too.

There's a fair amount of seating towards the back so that's pretty good for a DT place.

My only gripe is there are only 3 workers and they are constantly busy making the lines a little long however they do the best they can, I suggest they hire at least 2-3 more workers.

It is pricey, you're looking at Starbuck latte prices but it's worth every so often!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place so many times, it's awesome.

Everything is totally customizable. The servers are soo nice.

They've put up with me almost throwing up before.

(Not because of the drink, but because I usually come here super hungover if I'm staying at the Met before hand)

Also, they have a stamp card!! WOOT WOOT :)"}
{"text":"The more bubble tea I drink, the more I realize I did not give Chatime enough credit. Upping my rating from 3 to 4 stars. I love their coconut bubble tea!"}
{"text":"This OG store needs to be expanded! With the popularity of Chatime amongst late night diners and proximity to Ryerson, it's been a hit for about 6 years and will always be my fave. I remember prior to Chatime being open in the town where my university was located, I would come here before boarding the greyhound bus nearby. 

The store has enough seating for ~20 people and you wait in line behind their preparation area. My fave is grass jelly milk tea and peach green tea with aloe, both half sugar and less ice 

The crowds were still here at 11PM on Friday, and our wait was about 10 mins. Kudos to the friendly cashier who wasn't even phased by the growing lineup. Their waiting area is somewhat small so in the summer, id recommend waiting outside and periodically checking in on your order. Drinks were made perfectly and as an alumnus of Chatime, I most certainly miss working with my colleagues. Will be back as I always crave Chatime :)!"}
{"text":"There cannot be enough words to describe how great Chatime bubble tea is. There is always lots of people waiting at line at this location during peak hours. My favorite is hands down their Chatime Roasted Milk Tea with Tapioca. I always recommend it to my friends who have never tried it. They have a wide range of flavours and the bubble tea price is competitive compared to the other bubble tea chains around. I've always been a long time supporter of Chatime and will definitely continued to be in the future. You just can't go wrong with their bubble tea."}
{"text":"Chatime has become my go-to bubble tea place! My favourite drink from Chatime is the Roasted Milk Tea w/ Grass Jelly. I like how they allow customers to adjust the ice level and sugar level of their own drinks, as I tend to like drinks that are less sweet. Their menu options are quite extensive, prices are reasonable. Also, as a tip, get their membership card if you are a frequent customer, it doesn't cost anything to get the card, and you can get some great perks from it."}
{"text":"The roasted milk tea is heaven!!! All other BBT places have been ruined for me thanks to Chatime. I don't care if I have to wait 2 hours in the snow for their bubble tea - I will be coming back here the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"There isn't much I can add about this globally successful tea house franchise that hasn't already been stated in its other 150+ reviews. The shop is constantly filled with weaving lines that make it difficult to find seating. Good problems?

The popularity of this franchise is undeniable, so I thought I'd try to help out first time customers with some recommendations:

1) My favourite drinks are the roasted milk tea with grass jelly and the pearl milk tea. 

2) Don't be afraid to venture away from traditional tapioca and into other types of jellies  that they offer (although their tapioca preparation is fantastic).

3) You can adjust the amount of ice and sugar in your drink. I always ask for \"less ice\". Who needs a drink that cold?

4) Take a good look at their entire menu - they offer 80+ flavours. You'll have a great chance to check it out while waiting in line.

Hope your experience at Chatime is as great as its millions of customers' around the world!"}
{"text":"Chatime is always amazing. Never fails to get your drink in a perfect sweet condition!
This time, we got one regular pearl milk tea and one matcha green tea milk tea with tapioca. Considering how hyped Toronto is with matcha these days, this matcha green tea felt like it was lacking a bit of that strong matcha taste. 
The cafe itself is always crowded, lacking space for customers to sit down and enjoy the drink. 
It is always very humid: makes me wonder what the staffs' discomfort index would be -although, their skin looked all great, must be benefitting from all that moisture. 
Overall rating : 9 foggy glasses out of 10 beautiful skins"}
{"text":"Chatime, my first love.  It got me into the whole bubble tea craze.  I've had over 100 drinks from here throughout my life, making me a Chatime Elite member.  

My usual order: Regular Pearl Milk Tea, no ice, low sugar.  It never dissapoints.  The taro has a nice texture to it, some people complain that it's gritty but I love it.  Their toppings are always on point.  The Tea of the Months are pretty hit or miss.  The slushes are pretty weak, just avoid them and go with their great milk teas.

While it's not my favourite bbtea place anymore, it still holds a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"Probably the best bubble tea/milk tea in Toronto. It's a worldwide brand so I expect a lot and it didn't disappoint.

Choosing the sweetness and ice is pretty normal for milk tea shops. My favorites from the menu are (all are less ice + 50% sweetness)

- Matcha Milk Tea + Red Bean and Tapioca
- Brown Rice Green Milk Tea
- Taro Milk Tea"}
{"text":"Okay, finally jumped on the bandwagon on this place. Every time i pass this place its like a crazy jungle inside long lines up people yelling out their orders and the staff is frantically overwhelmed with the customers in the store. Okay so i lined up for 30 minutes to see the fuss was about. I ordered the Fresh Taro milkshake with tapioca and the Grassjelly Mix, Honestly if your lining up for more than 15 minutes do yourself a favour get yourself more than one drink. It was well worth it! The drinks were DELICIOUS! The tapioca was perfect and grassjelly was goood!!! It was funny to see the staff frantically going thru customers but i was even more impressed that they knew which drink which person ordered that was called talent! The service was good. The only thing is i wouldn't sit in here the place is crazy Loud you practically have to raise your voice tone to talk to the person next to you and its way overcrowded. You can definitely find some rude customers who cant take the waiting and lash out at the staff. Its not the staffs fault that they overwhelmed with customers let us all remember this and keep our cool. I didn't rate 5 stars as the drink were good but not as good as others i have drunk, the line up 30 minutes for a drink isn't really worth it!!! Id definitely come buy another drink but line up is just a turn off for me that i would rather go somewhere else. Do not go across the street to the one called Bubble Tease its not authentic tasting whatsoever."}
{"text":"I'm totally addicted to Chatime.  I have to first admit I'm extremely addicted to bubble tea.  Sometimes I drink it 5 times a week, or more.

My friends introduced me to Chatime and I loved it!  I tried their Roasted Milk Tea, and it was soo good!  It's really creamy and most bubble tea places do not carry this flavour.  

My friends and I don't live in Toronto, but we sometimes venture out to grab Chatime if we are craving it, or if we are in the area.

Their Strawberry Pudding Au Lait is also really good.  The pudding is a good alternative to tapioca.  It's really soft and creamy.  It tastes like a custard.

The only downside I would say is that sometimes it's so busy and the line-up is too long.  Once we waited in line for 45 minutes, and inside the store was extremely hot because of the machines and hot tea.  We were sweating in our winter coats waiting."}
{"text":"lets you choose your sugar level. Maybe put too much or too less in mine, didn't taste too good."}
{"text":"Shiny tea still has the best pearls. This place has good roasted milk tea and grass jelly. Flavour is there. Would not get the pearls though."}
{"text":"I've been going to the other location a lot lately and since I walked by this one, I decided to give it a try. Honestly, I didn't really like anything about it. I didn't like the atmosphere here, the person taking my order was rushing me even though there was no one else in line, they got my order wrong, and I really didn't like the bubble tea. I'm super disappointed because at the order location it was the complete opposite. Oh well, stick with what you like."}
{"text":"Taiwanese style bubble tea... the bubble tea tastes most like the Taiwanese bubble tea out of the places I've tried in Toronto.

BUT I think it's overrated! It's good but not OMG amazing. Plus long lineups and no games... the $5 bubble teas here, I can get for $1.20 in Taiwan :) But that's a different story, I guess.

Worth trying, bubble tea is good, but I wouldn't announce it to the world."}
{"text":"Chatime totally hits the spot...best bbt in Toronto (I'd say). I only wished that this place existed when I went to school in downtown.
You cannot go wrong with the Roasted milk tea with grass jelly- it is known to be one of their signature items. The Brown rice milk tea is also very good as the flavour is very unique. 
One other drink that I like is the taro milk tea since it is NOT powder, but real taro. My friend introduced me to it  in the winter (hot taro milk tea) and I have totally fell in love with it!  The cold one is also a win!
I recently tried on the weekend was their mango juice, it super refreshing and I do recommend it for the summer time. The only thing I wanted to mention was that over the weekend, they ran out of tapioca and so you had to wait for it if you really wanted it. I guess in my mind, a bubble tea place should never run out of bubbles...but i still really like Chatime and this particular location!!"}
{"text":"This place is not big, very narrow and deep, and it always has a line up.  The line up tends to move pretty quickly though...so it's not really a big deal.   Though I typically go during not really bubble tea hours....like random times during the workday, and it still seems to have a line.   

As with all Chatimes...I like that they use real tea, not the powdered stuff.   And I'm especially addicted to their Roasted Milk Tea with Grass Jelly.   Their grass jelly is slightly sweet, so I usually get no sugar and less ice to no ice.   

Remember to sign up for a Chatime card....1 point = 1 drink .  10 points = 1 free regular drink.  :-)  

Chatime definitely renewed my love of bubble tea."}
{"text":"Wait wut? There is actually such a thing as good bubble tea? Good as in, better than the flavoured powder stuff I grew up with? 

It drives me nuts how much friends rave about Chatime or post pictures online of their order--you don't see me taking snapshots of my unremarkable Starbucks cups. Hell, I do not understand what's so damn great about Chatime that drives fans crazy for it--must be an in-crowd cult thing. It drives me even more nuts explaining to non-Asian friends why what's with the name. 

Maybe Starbucks is a good analogy to what Chatime is to the boba world. If the overwhelming menu (most Asian tea diners have hefty menus) isn't enough to crash your mind, now throw in the whole ice and sugar business, which can seem more complicated than a complicated Starbucks drink. 

Ordering can be daunting for the uninitiated, but the gist is this: you can customize the level of sugar (full sugar, half sugar, 30% sugar, etc.) and ice (no ice, lots of ice, etc.) in your drink. Thus, an order could be stated accordingly: \"A regular peach green tea with no ice and half sugar, and grassjelly.\" I find that all levels of sweetness is a lot for me. Since I have not ever ordered anything without specifying the two parameters, I don't even know what you get if you didn't--like what's the default ice and sugar?

Let's not forget the add-on treats. For 50 cents extra per, throw in some pearls (tapioca/'boba'), and even grass jelly and aloe vera. A single drink will cost in total at least $5, which sounds a lot for bubble tea... or about on par with a typical Starbucks drink.

The staff are quick with their hands and get orders going fast, though they're not one for questions nor a conversation. On a typical day there will be a lineup. It looks short, but looks are deceiving--a line from the counter to the rear wall can be 15-20 mins long. There are seats, but often they are empty. 

We are not anywhere near Chinatown, and yet there's a small pocket of such bubble tea shops in the area. Chatime is the big name on the stage, but for all its worth, I just don't get what the hype is about or what makes it the best. The drinks didn't blow me out of the water nor feel like a crack addiction, certainly not when everything is too sweet. Nonetheless I get mesmerized by the sweet smell of boiling tapioca and red bean as I wait in line. 

I miss spitting pearls at friends through the fat straw--do kids still do that?

{TTC (this location): whatever gets you to Dundas and Bay, usually it's the 505 or the Bay bus.}"}
{"text":"The tea here is great. Probably my second favourite Chatime place behind the Markham location.

However, as good as the tea is I feel this location doesn't have the same peaceful environment as most tea shoppes and coffeehouses. The staff chat with each other very loudly to the point I can barely hear my own music via earphones at regular volumes and feel the need to kill my ears in order to barely hear. 

Otherwise it's a great place to have some awesome tea and work or chill out. I'd rate this location a 2.5 if Yelp would let me."}
{"text":"I came here in the afternoon on a weekday and it was quite busy. The gal taking orders was pretty friendly. I ordered the pearl milk tea. The milk tea itself was too milky but the boba was perfect, and pretty plump actually. You can tailor the sweetness and the amount of ice in your drink. Unfortunately, I couldn't find an almond milk tea option on their menu."}
{"text":"I'm really all about fresh fruit bubble teas but was really intrigued about reading the brewing and the training and all the good stuff that came with CHA TIME.

I walked in around lunch and was surprised to see that it was empty but it was drizzling outside. The staff was super patient with trying to help me pick something I would like, explaining to me the different teas, and the endless combinations you could put together.

In the end -I went with two very different drinks, in the hopes that one would be something \"he\" would fancy:
- Yogurt Green Tea with Coffee Jelly (there's a first!)
- Passion Fruit Tea with QQ (half pearls, half coconut jelly)

They were both very tasty, very different and it has to be your thing or else you may not like it. A few conclusions I did come to find:

1. The Yogurt is more like YODULY. If you like Yoduly (the small little plastic containers with the red tin foil that seals the top and has a beige coloured opague milk drink in it - then you will LOVE this.

2. The coffee jelly is very flavourful - so even though I could taste the yogurt green tea, it tasted the like the whole drink was coffee flavoured (again, this will be based on personal preference).

3. The passion fruit was your standard. Nice to have a bit of both types of add-ins at no extra charge.

sooooo excited to try the red bean the next time I'm there. LOVE LOVE LOVE red bean. loved all of this too!

P.S. Get your stamp card
P.P.S change your sweetness and eliminate ice if necessary"}
{"text":"I like this Chatime mainly for its location. It is nearby Yonge-Dundas square, the mall, restaurants, and the theatre. I come here pretty often since its closeby to the places I hangout around. 

I have tried many of their products. My favorites are the roasted milk tea, brewed oolong, honeydew milk tea, and brown rice green tea. I am not a huge fan of their juices or anything fruity flavor. I personally like the milk-based drinks. I like their tapioca, grass jelly, and pudding for toppings. In terms of sweetness, I generally ask for zero sweetness because everything is already quite sweet for my liking. 

One thing I don't like about this location is how tiny it is. It can get really crowded even if you are just getting takeout. There isn't much space for you to stand while waiting for your drink."}
{"text":"I remember eating at kenzo Ramen one day during the opening of Chatime and just chalked it up to being your run of the mill bbt joint. That is until I would see postings on my fb wall of the lineups and discussions about it. 

So I checked it out for the first time a month ago. My cousin recommended the roasted milk tea with grass jelly. Since then, I've been hooked. If you get the rewards card you get a free regular tea after you buy 10. I've already filled it up. 

I guess the thing that's hooked me is the roasted milk tea which you don't find at most bbt places. I also like the fact that you can customize the amount of ice and sweetness you want in it. Everyone has different preferences for that sort of thing, and to be able to adjust it to your specific taste is a big plus. 

There's no street parking, but that doesn't seem to have stopped people from pulling over in front of the store and running in to order. On weekend evenings, the line of cars outside is comparable to the line inside."}
{"text":"I used to go to Chatime frequently when I lived in SE Asia, so I was excited to find one in North America. Unfortunately, the one here blends their smoothies with water and creamer powder instead of milk and they refuse to substitute the real stuff (though they have it). The pearls are okay and the tea is fine, but it's not as good as back east, not even close. Hence the rating. I'd recommend going if you really feel like boba tea, but this location isn't worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"Fast service and delicious tea! I ordered and highly recommend the grass jelly roasted milk tea with pearls. You don't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Bit pricey, but still love it. It's a bubble tea place that doesn't just give you sugar with a bunch of water and ice. 

The best thing about this place is you get to choose the amount of sugar and ice you want. I always opt for less of each, and I find it taste better, especially less sugar for the fruit teas. 

Love the Hawaiian fruit tea; it's sooo refreshing on a hot day. 

I'll update my review when I get a chance to try more drinks :)"}
{"text":"I think everyone has to try chatime at least once! My friend recommended me to this place and HIGHLY recommended the roasted milk tea + tapioca / grass jelly. 

I LOVED IT! 

I'm warning you all, it's actually quite addicting. I went back twice to get the same drink even though I should try more of the other flavours... I used to get 100% sugar for my drinks but I've tried the 30% recently and there isn't a big difference on its flavour. Still yums!
The drinks were made within a timely manner. I'm usually in a rush whenever I visit the Dundas location so this place is good for grabbing a quick drink :)"}
{"text":"Love how they cook their tapioca and that you can choose how much sugar you want in it. Very overpriced though 

My favorites are the taro slush, red bean green tea and the milk tea"}
{"text":"Very busy place. No place to sit. I ordered #8 - QQ Grapefruit Juice. Not bad.
My friend ordered a milk tea and he got two."}
{"text":"Sympa ! Très bon bubble tea avec des tonnes et des tonnes de choix, beaucoup de thés différents et customisable à souhait (cf menu) !
D'après ce que j'ai pu observer, plus cher que les bubble tea de chinatown - mais je ne les ai pas goûté donc pas de comparaison possible !"}
{"text":"I was in town for business and my friend took me to this joint for a quick bubble tea.

Got the milk tea latte with grass jelly.  Excellent choice if you get a chance to stop by.

The look and feel inside is sort of a cafe style, but with technology everywhere. 

The minute you walk in, you smell tea and begin to appreciate what you're about to enjoy after you place your order.

Very fast service; in and out in 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Their beverage are pretty good compared to 168 or Ten ren. However, personally I prefer ShareTea more when it comes to quality and customization. The store is located conveniently for anyone who live downtown near U of T, which is a big plus. The store is usually busy, and when it's busy they sometimes ignore your customization requests (maybe I'm just unlucky).

Bottom line: If you are not up town and want some quality drink this is the place to go."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for bubble tea.  Often there are long lines and no seats inside to enjoy your drink.  Prices are average and the quality of the drinks are better than most places.  The 1L super cup is worth getting if you can drink a lot of bubble tea or willing to split it with a friend.  I would recommend coming here if line ups are not too long."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of bubble tea and Chatime is my go-to place as there are so many locations around the city. This location is located in the core of downtown and it is always packed. The line always curves around the washroom and the seats are quite crammed. There are two washrooms/stalls. It is a small store and most of the time, there is a table or two that's usually available. The workers do not take long to make the drinks and there are more seats near the front of the store, right in front of the window. I ordered the Roasted Popcorn Milk Tea with regular sugar levels and regular ice levels. Personally, it is my favourite drink here. It has a very unique flavour, tasting similar to coffee or cereal. There is also free wifi here!"}
{"text":"A wide selection of bubble tea to choose from, very well made tapioca, and incredibly creamy bubble tea. Chatime appears to be very clean as well, which is something you won't find at most Tea Shop 168 locations.

The one downside, as with most places that offer such quality of their competitors, is the huge line you'll find, usually leading right to, if not out the front door and around.

Give it a try though if you have 20 minutes to burn. It's undoubtedly the best bubble tea in the city."}
{"text":"They don't take old $50 bill?!? WTF. I'm not going back."}
{"text":"I end up popping by here often as the lady is a big fan of bubble tea here.

Me?  Not so much.  Well - I mean, I'm not usually a bubble tea drinker, but I do like the bubble tea here.

Most bubble tea joints have have some shitty 'tea' flavoured with shitty fruit flavours and with too much sugar.  Honestly, most bubble tea taste like melted milkshakes to me.

However, the Chatime Milk Tea and Roasted Milk Tea is quite good.  You can actually tell it's tea based and it's very fragrant.  This is top notch milk tea -- don't bother with the flavours and dilute it like a dumbass.  In addition, the consistency of pearls is excellent - everytime it's been fresh and chewy with the right 'bounce'.  And the ability to easily choose sugar and ice ratio is great.

The only downside is that it gets quite busy and line-up will be about 15 - 20 minutes at peak.

PRO-TIP: They offer a 'jumbo' size for +$1 from the large.  While I do not recommend one person drinking a litre of bubble tea in a sitting - you basically get a double size bubble tea to split.  The savings!  And if the bubble tea wasn't sweet enough, you can add your own saccharine by ordering a jumbo bubble tea and getting two straws."}
{"text":"Small, simply decorated bubble tea chain located at Yonge and Dundas. Lines are long and service is rather slow. 

Wide selection of various teas and extras such as jelly, tapioca, grass jelly, coffee jelly, etc. Allows customers to customize drinks by amount of ice and sugar. The chain has very interesting and refreshing tea combinations - my favourite as of now is the roasted milk tea with grass jelly. The flavour of the grass jelly is not very strong and the texture is so silky. I would order the drink with less sugar next time though. 

Price is a steeper than Teashop168 and Tenrens, at 4.2/small and 4.7/large on average. Extras are 50 cents more. 

I personally refer the location on Yonge and Finch.

4 stars, would definitely return if in the area."}
{"text":"Small little bubble tea place that just recently opened here on Dundas!  They don't have any menus blown up for you to look at yet, but they have pretty good offerings here.  Prices are decent considering the location.  You can also choose the amount of ice and sugar you want in your drink! 

May possibly come back to try out their wifi here when I start my studies."}
{"text":"First, don't go there at evenings especially Monday night. We went there last Monday night and the place is so dirty. I can't wait to get my drink and just get out of there immediately. I didn't noticed it when i entered the shop but there's a  heap of garbage ( napkins, straw packaging, etc) just in the corner where you'll pick up your drink. The floor is sticky too.. Ewwww.. Sticky due to spills.Unhygienic.  In addition to that, it's the schedule for the garbage pick up. So it's not a good time for milk tea or any kind of tea. Unappetizing. Just go to the one located at Bloor. 

Second, their price is like going to starbucks. There's a lot of variety to choose from but it's pricey. 

Aside from their menu, the good thing about this shop is that you can adjust the sugar level and ice level. Two good things and that's it. 

Three stars for taste."}
{"text":"5 dollars nets you some pretty tasty bubble tea! Their No. 1 tastes like solid milk tea, and with pearls and normal sugar, makes for a refreshing treat on a hot day."}
{"text":"This is my favourite bbt place! I think they make the best roasted milk tea out of all their other locations!!! It's a small place so usually I will grab a drink and go. Highly recommend their roasted milk tea!!"}
{"text":"Most bubble tea places are really average but Chatime takes it to the next level by offering well executed classics as originated from Taiwan and personalizing them to your taste. Crave it! A couple downsides: must lineup due to huge student crowds and Starbucks-like premium prices. I give it 4 stars mainly for the quality of the drinks."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of the place because their authentic taste to bubble tea. 

I had their taro and it was amazing. I love the fact it has taro bits in it and they always ask me about my ice and sugar level (I feel so taken care of~) 

I only wish they had small tapioca like bubble tea republic, but then it would be too perfect!"}
{"text":"The tea here is really rich and flavorful. It's a bit heavy and quite filling but I love it!!"}
{"text":"Been to this location many times before. Always a great experience, no matter how busy it gets (and it does get busy, often). My go-to is usually the Chatime roasted milk tea, but I tried the roasted tea latte this time around as it was a cold day. Love this tea flavour; strong black tea taste with slightly smoky notes. Reminiscent of one of my favorite teas, lapsang souchong, but not as intense. (Maybe they use some in the tea blend?) Would definitely love to try this again, but iced!"}
{"text":"My friends kept raving about Chatime being the best BBT in downtown Toronto.  We were actually back in the hotel after dinner, but decided to make a trek out here.

The lineup was long and the seats were all taken so we stood around until one of us can get a table while the others ordered.  

I can't remember exactly what I ordered, but it had grass jelly in it.  It tasted pretty good to me, but I wish I ordered something with tapioca instead.  That's more my flavor, but it was still otherwise worth the trek."}
{"text":"This location is always really busy due to its proximity to the Eaton Centre. Definitely would not recommend if you're looking for a place to hangout for a bit, because it's crowed and the seats are super cramped. 

For takeout, the line is usually 10-15mins wait, and yeah the servers are usually pretty impatient and a little rude due to all the customers they have to serve each day. So far the quality of the drinks are on par with other, slower paced locations though, so no complaints here."}
{"text":"We came here for bubble tea after having dinner further down Dundas Street. Even though it was relatively late (10 PM on a Friday night), this joint was packed, although to be fair it looked like most of the kids in there were of high school age (or younger?). Service was a bit on the disappointing side; they definitely did not have enough people working behind the counter, and we probably waited around 15 minutes to move up 4 spots in line. In Chinatown in NYC, we would've probably finished our tea by then...

As for the drinks themselves, they were pretty good. The flavors were interesting and different, and I really liked the one I got (hazelnut milk tea). It had a strong but not overpowering hazelnut flavor, and without any added sugar (the option I accidentally ordered), you got a very nice flavor that didn't come off as artificial. My girlfriend had the brown rice green milk tea, which probably could have used a little more sugar (she had the 2nd-lowest option) but had a nice hint of rice undertones. The tapioca was too chewy in my opinion, which, combined with the slightly higher-than-average prices, earns it a star off on my rating. All in all, though, the bubble tea here is pretty solid, and for a spot that's basically right in downtown Toronto, it's not a bad stop at all if you don't want to head to Chinatown for your bubble tea fix."}
{"text":"Yes ordering can be a little overwhelming but luckily the 10 minute wait (worth it) gives you time to sort yourself out. 

Stumbled in this place by accident, was livid at my friends for not telling me about it sooner. Caramel milk tea was AMAZING. think caramel frappaccino-ish only not disgusting. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Peach green tea with coconut jelly $4.70
First time having this combination of flavours. Tasted great and can't wait to have it again. Maybe this flavour will become more popular and make the top 10 list....lol"}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious bubble tea. 
That is all you need to know. 
Try the donuts too, surprisingly good for a bubble tea shop. 
The line is usually ridiculously long, but once you taste the drink you will understand why so many people crave it."}
{"text":"Where do you go when you're only in town for one day? Obviously, bubble tea!  We were downtown so my friend suggested that we go to Chatime after our ramen lunch. Perfect way to finish off our meal and cool down from the heat.

This place was awesome.  First time that I've ever had grass jelly and really like how they give you the choice of how much sugar you want and even ice!  Fully customizable, every BBT should be like this and way too many options (a good problem to have).

Anyways, we tried:
-  Chatime roasted milk tea with grass jelly ($4.70 for a large).  Delicious.  I ordered it with less ice and 50% sugar, which was perfect.  If Iived in Tdot, would definitely come here all the time.
-  Hazelnut chocolate milk tea with pudding ($4.20 for regular + $0.50 for pudding).  Definitely on the sweeter side but the pudding was interesting option to add to my friend's drink.
-  QQ honeydew milk tea ($4.50 for regular)

Great spot.  Place was consistently busy but not overwhelming.  Definitely check it out and try something new from their massive menu."}
{"text":"The shop was pretty busy when we came in, however the cashier did get our order wrong (we ordered a green milk tea but got a green tea instead. I ordered once in English but she didn't seem to understand what I was saying, so I did so again in Mandarin), and she threw us attitude when we asked her to change it, and said \"I asked you, that's what you said\"."}
{"text":"best bubble tea in the area (downtown)!
it comes hot or cold, and you can adjust the sugar too.
my favourites are the roasted milk tea with grass jelly and the brown rice tea.
they're always busy with lines out the door sometimes. but they're very efficient at pumping out drinks, one time I got my drink within 30seconds. 
however, i find the decor eye-searing, and i'm not a big fan of the purple.
sometimes their drinks can come out really sweet (?) so make sure to ask for less sugar."}
{"text":"Wow, maybe it was the lineup out the door, maybe it was the sweet smell of silky milk tea in the air.  As others have said they must put cocaine in their boba tea as it is so addicting and refreshingly good!  

Tons of flavours of every kind of tea/slush hot or cold you are looking for.  The night I came I ordered a lychee milk tea.  Soooo good.  What I like is you can order it just as you like with amount of ice and bubbles or grass jelly!  

Let me know if you find a better bubble tea in Toronto cause this place is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Hmm...maybe I'm not accustomed enough with bubble tea, but my friend and I weren't overly impressed with the product we got.

My friend got a taro smoothie. While the taro taste was clearly evident (and it didn't seem like they used powder), the smoothie was way too thick. She didn't finish it until about half an hour later when the smoothie thinned out. I got a mango green tea with tapioca, which tasted good and definitely had the authentic mango taste, but the orange that was added just seemed weird and out of place.

There was no A/C in the restaurant, which in a day like today meant it was quite stuffy. If the place traditionally has no A/C, I can't see myself visiting here very often during the summer.

Free wifi! Password is the phone number."}
{"text":"The bubble tea is great . But since what happened last night i have to rate it down to 3 stars. I  went to Chatime for a bubble tea last night. I collected 8 stamps on my Chatime stamp card so i was able to redeem a free bubble tea when i was there. I didn't mind paying extra for the tapioca and enlarge the size of the drink. So I decided to use my debit card to pay because i didn't have cash on me. The cashier told me that they don't accept debit card if it's less than $3. Then I ended up spending the whole price for a bubble tea. I know it's the rules from the boss but i think it's stupid. I just felt like i just got slapped in the face last night after what happened."}
{"text":"I've been to the near dundas square and this one at burhnamthorpe and I can say they do an amazing job of exceeding my expectations. The top 10 list in the front really does help to see what people are buying, which is a plus. The only reason I gave them a 4 is because of the long wait times. Otherwise very good overall."}
{"text":"Love this place!  There are so many different drinks (teas, milk teas, smoothies, etc) and different condiments to compliment the drinks (boba, pudding, jellies, etc).  I went twice and both times had a decently longer line than what I'm used to when getting bubble tea.  What's convenient is instead of newbies asking what is popular, Chatime has their most popular drinks numbered on the wall above their kitchen/drink making area.

The first time I got the No. 1 - Chatime and 2nd time was No. 3 - Red Bean Chatime.  You can control the sweetness of your drink and had some sugar added to my drink.  They were both good!  Not very sweet, even with sweetener, but still tasty!  Be careful if you choose the Red Bean Chatime as they add red beans to the drink.  Overall, delicious!"}
{"text":"All this hype for nothing...I gave it an extra
Star because it had unique selections unlike others but honestly i wasn't too impressive....first off $5 for a small bbt and its a takeout place, I ordered some drink that was suppose to have 3 layers to it but when i got it, it looked and tasted like crap....pudding sucked it here
Save ur money and goto gofor tea or tea ren for some real quality bbt"}
{"text":"I don't think I will ever go to Tea Shop 168 again! 

Chatime has stepped it up a notch with interesting flavours and the flexibility to customize your bubble tea! I like!! I got the caramel milk tea (which was 'recommended' on the menu). So delicious! Not artificial/oversweet tasting at all. Drinks are expensive, but not more so than most bubble tea places. You can get a loyalty card which gets you a free drink for every 10. 

The space is clean and white with some magazines and random quotes about tea written on the back wall. It's a fun place to hang out with friends, and if you get hungry or want some sake, Don Don Izakaya is just upstairs!"}
{"text":"The drinks are solid - but they're not cheap.  You're looking at $5.00 for a bubble tea.  Now in our world of overpriced coffees, this is a most delicious alternative - but, again, be prepared to drop that for a drink.

The location has quite a bit of space in it, although getting your order seems to be somewhat of a pseudo science.  It doesn't matter when you place your order, or when they get the hot water boiled - people just place orders in random succession and get their drinks according to some internal logic, beyond the comprehension of others.

That - and the hot tea?  It's not exactly hot.  Warm, perhaps, but not hot.  Even when a request for the tea to be heated was made, it still came back the same tepid temperature.

And they run out of flavours.  Desire an Orange green tea?  Not always an option.  

I get that places run out of stock, but this is a bubble tea place, the flavours should always exist.  It would be like a burger joint running out of burgers (or pickles / onions at the least.)

I'd go back.  I'd enjoy it.  But it's not the perfect place I had hoped for."}
{"text":"It's four stars relative to other bubble tea places. All their Cha times are good. More tea flavour than others. But it's overpriced for what it is and the line ups are really long. I only buy this when I'm weak."}
{"text":"Parking is free after 9pm, woooot!

Pros: tea is good...really good.  Boba is good, as well.  Nice and chewy.  And I like how they have a variety of drink additions aside from tapioca pearls (i.e. rainbow jelly, coconut jelly)

Cons: service here sucks..seriously.  The workers aren't friendly.  I don't know why i bother asking Asian places to customize my drink sometimes.  (Aside from their more/less sugar/ice, they aren't very accommodating.)  Seating area also sucks.  The place is tiny.  It's more of a grab-and-go place than grab-a-drink-sit-here-and-chill place.  I clearly prefer the latter, haha.

Recommendations:
- Milk tea with boba: I think if a boba place can do this standard drink well, they're good.  And Cha time does this standard drink well.
- Mango green tea (w/ or w/o coconut jelly): next time, I'd order it w/80% sugar bc the 100% sugar was kind of tooooo sweet.

Don't bother ordering:
- Matcha green tea: bland"}
{"text":"I ordered a regular Taiwan mango. The sweetness was just right but I thought the ice cubes got a bit annoying since the tapioca got stuck inside them for some reason. It would be a lot better if the ice cubes were either smaller or shaped differently."}
{"text":"Their milk-based teas are exceptional. They let you choose whether you want less/more ice, less/more sugar, less/more tapioca, etc (very typical of a legitimate bbt place). They make it so well, the taste gives me a clear memory of Taiwan. Hazelnut and fairy vanilla milk tea are both great choices. Big lineups but they serve you pretty quickly. They have some seating in the back but people typically order to go. Definitely making more trips to come here."}
{"text":"One of my friends LOVE this place. I, on the other hand, find this place mediocre. There's nothing wrong with this place nor is there anything amazing about it either. I'm pretty sure you can get cheaper bubble tea drinks at Tea Shop 168 but I haven't been there in a while so I can say that with certainty. One thing I do enjoyed about this place is that their menu is very straight forward which I appreciate. I also like how they give you options to make your drink to perfection."}
{"text":"it's a small place and the drinks are a bit overpriced but you get to personalize your drink.  I've only been there twice but my wallet hurt each time.  and was it tasty ? it was ok.    their sparkling black tea was delicious.  but again unnecessarily pricey"}
{"text":"A busy bubble tea place is a tell tale sign that you've made the right choice. I went on a Friday night and it was packed. There are plenty of options to choose from and levels of sweetness which is appreciated. Not the cheapest place but overall it's worth it."}
{"text":"I love their bubble teas and my favourite is the red bean milk tea with bubbles. I also like that you can customize your drink such as adding less sugar or less ice. But it is definitely overpriced for what they're giving you."}
{"text":"Tried out Chatime in London a year ago so I was juiced to see one here in Toronto. Through searching Yelp, Chatime seemed the most promising bubble tea spot. I ordered the mango green tea with boba and it was pretty lit. Well priced and it did it's job. I love the option that you can choose the sweetness and ice level. 

The structure of the location is very narrow and tight, so chances are your butt will be in front of someone's face 75% of the time. 

If you're in the mood for boba, I would recommend Cha Time."}
{"text":"Chatime is literally, the BEST bubble tea I've had! I drink bubble tea a lot and a lot of the times, if its not made properly, it becomes a drag to finish. But Chatime allows you to customize how much sugar and ice you want, so its perfect for you! And best of all, they have SO many flavors! In terms of price, it's not cheap but its not the most expensive one I've had either! I definitely go often!"}
{"text":"I usually get honeydew milk tea with double rainbow jelly or triple rainbow jelly, depends on how I feel that day. But wdf, I came here after CNE since it was the closest chatime and on the way home. The cashier did not allow me to get 3 toppings on my Large honeydew milk tea even though I would've paid for the toppings! Seriously? My friends and I customize TOPPINGS at other chatime locations (warden/steeles and midland/finch) without resistance. \"No sorry, we don't do that.\" Give me a break! Go somewhere else, avoid at all costs, if you want to customize your drink, seems like they limit your drink to one topping, unless I had an isolated incident. From the looks of it, the customer is not right and they cannot accommodate a single request with minimal effort needed on their side.

Here, as a Chatime franchise, they the quality and customization should be the same, I have uploaded a receipt of me getting triple jelly, something that they *don't do*"}
{"text":"This is my 5th time at Chatime and every time I am still mesmerized at how good their drinks taste. The tea they use is high quality, I would know since as an Asian I had my share of bubbleteas. Their tapioca is cooked well, grass jelly and pudding are yummy too. 
Today I tried strawberry pudding au lait. If you are a Starbucks frappucino fan, Chatime's Au lait is similar to that, in my opinion au lait taste better and it's cheaper too!

What I also like is how you can pick how much sugar and ice you can put into your drinks. I get 50% sugar usually for everything because I think too much sugar/syrup takes away from the original flavors of their quality ingredients. In addition I recommend less ice so you get more bang for your buck and when your ice melts it won't water out the taste. 

Good drinks that I have tried: (don't remember all their names) hot ugi something (it's like matcha drink with red bean inside), roasted milk tea with grass jelly, hot and cold original milk tea with tapioca, matcha tea latte (go for full sugar if you don't like the bitter taste of matcha), strawberry pudding au lait (it has pudding), grapefruit green tea"}
{"text":"So this has got to be one of my favourite bubble tea places! It is extremely busy since it's so close to Yonge and Dundas and Eaton Centre and you never usually get seating. It is very narrow walking in and line ups go to the back of the store. We came around 1:30pm on a weekday and the line up was long which took us half hour to get our bubble tea. Just know it gets extremely hot in here because the place is small! I recommend the coconut, hazelnut with and chocolate hazelnut with half sugar and tapioca. Love it!"}
{"text":"Brought my friends here to try as we wanted bubble tea. They were surprised at how busy it was and automatically had high hopes for this place, and they were not disappointed. It was almost 11pm and there were still lines winding throughout the store. I honestly think they should consider expanding their store as they were so busy. They didn't have enough space inside to accommodate the line and people sitting, as the people in line were literally 5cm from the people sitting. I do give them credit though for moving the line relatively quick. The Grass Jelly Roasted Milk Tea was really good, and they followed directions with ice and sweetness perfectly. I suggest if you're a first timer like my friends, you won't go wrong with ordering from their top 10 menu."}
{"text":"It is really bad when there is a long line up and the people behind the counter are all chatting about their personal lives. When there is a long line up, they need to work not gossip."}
{"text":"I first went to Chatime late summer/early fall when it was brand new and not fully set up yet. It was a sweltering day and unbearably warm inside. Frankly, it didn't look all that impressive.

The bubble tea definitely changed my mind though! I love their selection of flavours--good old classics along with more interesting varieties we don't normally get in Toronto tea shops. (I'm tired of endless lists of fruity bubble teas where you really don't taste the tea!) I like that you can really customise your drink; I often opt for less sugar and less ice. I've since been back several times, and their finished interior is quite nice as well. You would never know it was once in the unfinished state I saw it in. This is definitely one of the best bubble tea places downtown, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've had some of their bubble teas and overall it is alright. Not quite as good as Ten Ren's. However, for the price of a large drink at Chatime, it is very well worth it. A large, for most of their drinks, is only $5.31 (taxes included)! 

Drinks I've had:
The roasted milk tea is great; very delicious strong tea flavour, and the right amount of sweetness.

The pearl black tea did not taste good for some weird reason... It tasted like something about the drink was rancid - it had a flavour of paint... On the flipside, the bubbles were tasty! Right amount of sweetness.

The taiwan plum ice tea was not my cup of tea. I have never had this type of flavour before and decided to try it based on the green leaf next to it, which usually means it will taste good. It was so weird; it was super sweet and on top of that, salty. I didn't like the taste at all. I got this in regular sweetness and ice too.

If there is something that sorta bothers me here, it's that their workers are a little negligent on service. Since the person who inputs my order isn't the one who makes my drink, it got confusing when they would shout out a ready drink order # instead of shouting out the drink name. I would prefer them to write down my name if that's the case, I don't like feel like being a number among others."}
{"text":"Great milk tea, but the extremely long lines kill. It's not as cheap as some competitors (at about $5 tax included for a large), but it's well worth it. Get a large instead of a medium, since the price difference is small. Also, go for 50% sugar instead of 80% or 100%. This way you can really taste the flavour you picked! My personal favourite flavour is red bean. The service is ok, nothing special but not bad. The 3 stars are for the quality of the drinks, which are my favourite in Toronto for bubble tea. The large selection of flavours, options for customizing sweetness and ice, and the quality of the taste are what make it the best to me. That said, it's definitely not somewhere where you can sit down and enjoy your drink - too busy for that!"}
{"text":"Their bubble teas are soo yummy and inexpensive. Sad thing is that you must wait in a long a** line that can take forever just to order."}
{"text":"Tried my usual here but I almost didn't know what my usual is as I was so used to saying \"#2 please\". At the Bay Dundas location, they did not have the menus w/ numbers like the other locations. As always, I like that we choose the sugar level, no ice, etc. 

I came in the early afternoon and there was no line up. Sweet !"}
{"text":"I've been to Chatime in London, Beijing, New York, Toronto and Foster City, I'd say I'm a fan. 

Favourites: roasted milk tea, roasted oolong milk tea, passion fruit tea. 

The line in this branch is a bit long though."}
{"text":"Roasted milk tea, that's about it.
Just kidding, in all honesty this place is quite the bubble tea shop. Their quality is clearly shown in their drinks but the lines are just brutal. Sometimes lines go as long as 10-20 minutes! However, for some weird reason I find myself constantly coming back despite the long lines.
If you're in the area, i definitely recommend this tea shop."}
{"text":"Late post - Spring/Summer 2013

My friends who work downtown always tell me how good this bubble tea place is, so I've decided to check it out for myself :) Already a long line up *sigh* but since it was my first time there... it would buy me some time to check out their extensive menu while I wait in line. The line actually moved fairly quickly!

I have always heard people say, when checking out a new bubble tea place for the FIRST time, you MUST order the original milk tea with tapioca. Why? Because if you know the original one taste good, everything else should taste good! I don't know what mentality that is hahaha... but I did end up order the original milk tea with tapioca XD

You can also choose the level if sweetness and how much ice you want in your drink. Very thoughtful :) But I was pretty clueless at this first encounter, so I just got the REGULAR sweet with REGULAR ice lol. Next time I know I can make adjustments! My drink did come out a tad too sweet for me. And the only problem was that I didn't like the texture/chew of the tapioca :(

I did go back a second time during the summer. This time I ordered the roasted milk tea with grass jelly. IT WAS SO TASTY!!! It wasn't as sweet even though I got REGULAR, maybe because it was roasted? *thumbs up* and the grass jelly was very smooth :) I'm sticking with that one!"}
{"text":"I don't get all the hype?

I have been wanting to try this place for a while now, because of all the glowing reviews, but I never had the patience to wait in line.

Walked by one Sunday afternoon and there was no line up! SCORE!

I ordered a large Roasted Milk Tea with Grass Jelly, that was recommended by numerous reviewers on Yelp. What a disappointment.

I didn't taste any \"roasted\" flavour, or any tea flavour, for that matter.  It just tasted like watered down milk with sugar and grass jelly.

Unfortunately, there aren't many bubble tea places downtown, so I can understand why it might be considered \"good\".

However, there are just so many other better tea places in the GTA."}
{"text":"this review is based on two visits so take it with a grain of salt.

like everybody says, it is crowded and the lines are long - a most reliable sign of quality bubble tea! the servers, however, are quick in taking orders and they pump out drinks like machines. 

on both of my visits, they made my drink exactly to my specifications. the ingredients were of good quality. i'm not a huge bubble tea drinker (7 times a year?), but this was good bubble tea. i wouldn't get bubble tea from anywhere else."}
{"text":"Last night I went to the Chatime location in Mississauga, and order the taro smoothie with tapioca. Before I go into the drink quality I want to make mention  that the girl making the drink put her hand along the rim of the cup... Regardless of what time of lid you put on the cup its not health code to do that. It irked me so bad, but I bit my tongue and waited for my beverage.

The drink was awful--flavorless not too mention the consistency was too thick,probably resulting from too much ice. The tapioca was warm... Never had that happen before, that was disgusting too. The beverage itself tasted grainy, which it never usually does at my regular bubble tea hotspot, Bubble Republic.

I came here based on a recommendation from a friend was thoroughly disappointed and cheesed that I spent money on such a disgusting drink. Never again I say! NEVER again!!!!"}
{"text":"Like all cha times, this one is at a great convenient location, and the bubble tea is amazing. 

This one in particular alwaaaays has a huge line...(sometimes the line even trails to outside the store)..on a regular day, no promotional offers. 

But it's cool how fast the line moves and how they get through so many orders so quickly. So the wait time is definitely shorter than you would expect ."}
{"text":"The best boba drink in Toronto area.
We tried so many different places during our trip, and they all suck besides Chatime, a Taiwanese \"international\" chain boba place.
Too bad we do not have it in San Diego or LA area :(
I also tried the one in NY Chinatown. It was good too!

For a regular size grass jelly roasted milk tea, it came out $5+, it's a little pricey.
However, if I ever come to Toronto again, this is the only boba place I would go for sure."}
{"text":"Really good menu and options! I had a milk matcha bubble tea, and it was delicious. You can choose the percentage of sugar also, which is a great option if you don't like extra sweet drinks! I noticed most of the customers ordered in Chinese, there was a slight language barrier, but nothing serious. I'll go back when the craving for bubble tea strikes again."}
{"text":"ChaTime! 

Out of the hundreds probably thousands - this is my absolute favourite place to go for bubble tea in Toronto. I've tried the other ChaTime location, but it does not compare to the downtown location. 

*The tapioca is made perfectly, it is chewy, not hard. 
*The teas are good, it was the first time that I was asked how I liked my tea. (Sweetness, amount of ice) I thought that it was a great idea. (It obviously caught on, as you can see in many other teashops currently) 
*Rewards card: after you buy 9 bubble teas you are entitled to get (any) one free bubble tea (LOVE THIS because I'm a frequent ChaTime customer)
*The atmosphere: although it gets quite busy at times, it is a great place to sit and hang out. There is free WIFI and it is consistently clean. 

Like I mentioned previously, it does get quite busy, which means that there are chances that you might have to wait in a line that goes out the door. However, there are other times that there are no lines - allowing you to purchase your bubble tea right away. 

I definitely recommend this place to any bubble tea lovers and enthusiast or even the bubble tea virgin. There is a variety and always new flavours (+ toppings) to try.  :)

{"text":"It was my first time trying out this bubble tea place and I really didn't enjoy my experience here. The line up was sooo long and I really hated the fact that their space is so small. It was hard to find seats because it was crowded. Their menu seems so over priced compared to other bubble tea places. I asked the cashier if I can get a mango strawberry smoothie even though it's not on the menu and he's like it's not possible. I'm pretty sure it is possible because other places have done it for me before, even though it was not on their menu. I ended up ordering the mango slush instead. It was ok, but I've tasted better. I definitely will not go back. There are so many other bubble tea places better than this. Honestly, this place is not worth the time or the money. I wouldn't even say it's #1 because they can't live up to that."}
{"text":"Good bubble tea, nothing to go crazy about but you won't be disappointed. It's a bit more expensive for the portion size ($5 for a regular size, most places i've been to uptown are $5 for a large). I got the mango slush.

There always seems to be a small line, but it moves quickly."}
{"text":"I had to come all the way to Toronto, Canada to find some of the best ever boba/pearls!!!  Coming from Vegas where I've tried quite a few different boba spots, I was pleasantly surprised to find such a tasty spot.

There seems to be quite a line each time we walked past this place so today we decided to wait in that line.  Boy oh boy am I glad we did.  The line seems SO long but they cleared it quite fast.  They have a large easy to read menu with a ton of options.  I ordered a large coffee smoothie extra thick with pearls and regular sugar.  The pearls were perfectly squishy.  Only complaint I have is their straws are not nearly large enough.  It was an easy fix though. I stopped down the street at the convenience store where they sell \"slurpees\" with gigantic straws.  

The location is ideal as its blocks away from the actual China Town here in Toronto and a block away from the mall.  If I'm lucky we will make another trip over before they close for the night!"}

Decent, average bubbletea prices. 
Allows you to choose ice and sugar level.  
Delicious bubbletea. I always come here when I go to Eatons. 

My fave is the brown rice milk tea with tapioca and grass jelly with less sugar and no ice."}
{"text":"Though I frequent Chatime, the lines are getting too long and the baristas are not fast enough to keep up. There needs to be a system where they can take your order before you pay so the baristas can work faster than the person on cash. The line is not worth it."}
{"text":"In 2 days and 2 Chatime locations, I feel that my former favourite bubble tea spot has been slipping sadly.  Chatime was one of the first import of the really well known Asian brands to bring in better bubble tea.  Not just the sugary powder stuff but the use of more natural flavours, less colouring and real tea.   After a few years and many more newer brands in Toronto, I feel Chatime has relaxed a little too much and forgotten what they originally brought to the GTA.  No longer is it the nice deep rich tea flavour, creamy milkiness, or perfectly QQ chewy bubbles.

This particular location is just outside of the super busy Dundas Square and Eaton Centre.  With a constant flow of shoppers and UofT students, this place is biiiiz-zee.  Ridiculously so that even on a early evening of 7 pm, there was still a constant line up.  The spot is not very big ... it only has 2 medium sized in the back and a few other little 2 tops in here.  It's not very well lit either even though it was still light out.  With the huge line up and the big batch of bubbles being cooked, it was hot, stuffy, and humid.  Not an inviting spot to stay in very long.  I couldnt wait to get out.

Though the line up was pretty busy, I have to at least commend the service. The 3 people behind the counter were working hard.  One was constantly and quickly taking the orders and making sure the bubbles and toppings were in the cups.  The other two never stopped making drinks... they were always moving.  I was worried it'd be a long wait but from start to end, it was maybe 15 minutes.  Seeing how there was at least 9 people in front of me at first, I think this was really quick.

QQ Lychee Juice - Light and sweet but oddly enough a bit tart for a lychee fruit.  There seemed to be a sour note that was odd to the flavour.  The other item that was disappointing... the bubbles.  For the large cup, there was maybe less than 1 Inch of bubbles on the bottom.  Maybe Real Fruit and other spots have been too generous but Chatime had less bubbles of other medium drinks.  Plus their bubbles was over cooked and more soggy than anything else.  3/5

Seasonal Strawberry Passionfruit Green Tea - A seasonal new drink just for the spring and early summer.  This sounded really refreshing but the green tea they used had an astringent and bitter note that overpowered any good berry flavour.  Perhaps it was the passionfruit?  They can be tart but this wasn't the best drink to be lightly sweet and refreshing.  3/5

With the constant huge line up and medicore ok drinks, I feel that there has to be better for me to try.  I'll keep searching even though sadly this used to be one of my favourite brands."}
{"text":"Always a safe bet for consistently, above average tea, and arguably the longest lines out of all GTA Chatime locations - the queue moves quickly though so don't let that deter you. I typically get the Brown Rice Green Milk Tea (#9 most popular), which has a light but slightly toasty taste - adding Grass Jelly if it's a ~fancy~ day. I like that you can choose the ice and sugar levels since most other places are too heavy handed. The \"straight\" teas are generally good here though I can't say the same for the fruity drinks. I would also recommend taking out as the seating is pretty tight and it's gets quite stuffy in there.

Heads up about the Vicinity card (rewards program): I've heard a lot of mixed info on whether it costs money or not, but I finally got one for free at this location recently"}
{"text":"3.5*
ok, I'll admit it, I have some sort of a weird soft spot for bubble tea! 
I even go to teashops to play board or card games now and then. Maybe it's the product of growing up in North Toronto or maybe... actually it's definitely the product of growing up in North TO! Either way, Chatime is one of the few BBtea spots I've been to south of Eglinton and it's different in a lot of ways. 
On the bright side you can customize your drink almost more than anywhere else I've been to, you can even suggest the % of sugar or ice you'd like to add. The staff are very nice and patient with the customization meaning the combinations are nearly endless. It's also a relief that you are definitely getting tea at Chatime when you order it as opposed to mystery powder based drinks you may be served at some uptown locations. 
That being said, there are times that the bubble tea doesn't taste the greatest, and I don't even think it's because of my wild customizations!
Also the space is very bland and small and this definitely isn't one where you can sit for a catchup sesh or a game of gin rummy."}
{"text":"As a true Taiwanese myself, I think Chatime did an ok job on bubble tea - It is really pricy though.
The line is often way too long, and the services are eh, ok."}
{"text":"Crowded place, but relatively fast service. Constant freshness and quality, but do not expect fresh fruits!! Everything is from powders and syrups here. Tapioca pearls are perfect (my favorites so far...).

Very good list of drinks but you cannot create your special own combinations, such as mango with milk tea... waiter will just tell you they do not do this and it would taste bad (tell that to Indians who drinks lassi mango....). So, if you crave for a juice made from real mangos with roasted (or not) milk tea, or any other combo that is not on their list, just cross the street to Bubble Tease where there is no-one (why?) and they use fresh fruits and combine anything you wish for... thus, if it tastes bad, that is your fault (their tapioca bubble is harder to chew... not my favorite, but OK)."}
{"text":"I began working in the Bay and Dundas area in January. I've already filled up half a stamp card (10 stamps + a free one)! I always get the same thing - grass jelly roasted milk tea, less ice. There's a slight difference between the roasted milk tea and the normal one (they say that the roasted milk tea has a stronger tea flavour). A good milk tea is hard to find, so I was very happy when I discovered this place. They always ask about how much ice and sugar you want, so if you're looking to cut down your sugar levels, this is the place to go to. 

My only complaint is the price - a large grass jelly roasted milk tea works out to $5.32 after tax. There are more expensive places, but this is by no means the cheapest. Also, a word of advise to those new to bubble tea: their menu isn't very complete, so you might want to look up some information about it online before you go."}
{"text":"This place has yummy bubble tea! There was a lineup, but that's how you know it's good lol ;) They have a bunch of flavours (I tried hazelnut chocolate milk tea - like nutella!) and give you options to change the amount of ice and/or sugar to suit it to your taste. Kinda pricey, even for bubble tea, and the place is small so it can be hard to find somewhere to sit if you plan on sticking around, but all in all a great experience!"}
{"text":"It is the Starbucks of bubble tea and I'm addicted. Gotta have it whenever I'm in the area. It's an extensive menu but there are definitely some stand out options. Roasted milk tea is creamy and so good. Red bean matcha slush is really good too. I am a fan of the brown rice green tea. I find it refreshing.

I love the QQ items because it already comes with tapioca and jelly. I do find that their juices are too sweet so definitely cut back on the sugar level (I usually get no sugar). 

They serve donuts and other pastries and cookies here now. Have yet to try them but I can imagine them being a bit stale sitting out with no takers. 

Yes it is a bit pricier and yes there are other bubble tea shops in the area but Cha Time has a reputation for a reason. Try it once for yourself."}
{"text":"So it's been a while since I've been in Toronto so when I was walking along Dundas street and came upon this new Taiwanese looking joint, I was pleasantly surprised.

Admittedly, I stood outside of this place looking it up and down and trying to figure out if this was a real taiwanese bbt shop place that just opened up, or was it another immigrant wanting in on the (no longer) lucrative bubble tea business. After looking at their menu and seeing real tea items on there and some very typical Taiwanese drinks (grass jelly with milk) and very taiwanese style of naming the drinks, I decided that even though I was just walking by, i should try their tea anyway.

I ordered their grass jelly in roasted milk tea for (4.75+tax). Expensive. 
The lady who helped me is Taiwanese and explained to me what roasted milk tea (more flavour) in Mandarin, which made me feel like home.

Another authenticity proof is the ability to have less sugar and less ice...they have that at ever bbtea stand in taiwan, but this is one of the few times i've seen it here.

Will definitely go back to explore the other options."}
{"text":"Service is okay. Ordered takeout so I cannot really rate the service, however I notice the employees (cashier, tearista) could be more nicer. 
I ordered Hazelnut milk tea today and it tastes quite similar to other locations. 
Everything was okay but I think I might choose to go other bbt places around because there is really nothing special about this location."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype about this place! After being overtaken by a sudden urge for tea, I ended up standing in the rain for half an hour surrounded by clamouring groups of Asian youths just to satisfy my craving. I ordered a Taro milk tea (my favourite!), and waited anxiously to stab my straw through the top and gulp it down.

What I got was a cup filled with tasteless, powdery liquid. There were actual clumps of powder dispersed throughout the drink, and I only drank most of it from some sick sense of obligation to finish it given the time and effort I had put forth to acquire it. Thinking about it makes me shudder. 

Although I will give Chatime a single star for having an extensive menu as well as customization options, I WILL NOT RETURN."}
{"text":"It still blows my mind that people will line up out the door for this place. Unfortunately, I have several friends who swear by this place so its not uncommon for us to make a detour to come here and then wait in line. I hate to be that person who insists on going somewhere else but I would never choose to come here on my own because I hate the crowded wait. 

Yes, the milk tea is relatively better than other places and definitely worth the price but it is by no means worth waiting 20 minutes and often times longer. The shop in itself is tiny, crowded, and hot so I would not want to stay here a moment longer than I needed to - most people just take it and go. 

It's nice that you can customize your drink, I like being able to control the amount of sugar, ice and tapioca in my bubble tea so that's definitely a plus!"}
{"text":"Great bubble tea with room for customization. Gets pretty busy and can be hot in here. My favourites are mango green tea and caramel milk tea. Mmm."}
{"text":"Fresh Milk Grass Jelly Drink  regular size ($4.75) at Chatime! Was it good? Totally, but it is on the pricey side.

In between meals and looking for somewhere to chill and wifi a little. Chatime is a great alternative near the Bay and Dundas area.

Since Chatime is new, everything is sparkling clean... super clean washrooms!!

I think I will come back to try out other tea based drinks, as Chatime, means Tea Time!"}
{"text":"Insane lines here and the layout is not optimized for a line up of customers. The workers work as fast as they could but the wait can be brutal. It's also not the cleanest place to hang out either, tables are usually messy or dirty and because the line usually snakes around, you have a constant number of people bumping into you. The bubble tea is good but the snacks (donuts, macarons) are overpriced."}
{"text":"Famous bubble tea shop around the world. I saw it almost everywhere, Taipei, KL, Singapore?Sydney or Toronto.  It took me almost 20mins to place the order and I ordered the Mocha bubble tea, which I think it's tasty but not worth the wait"}
{"text":"I really like the bubble tea from Chatime. The only one I get is the bubble tea milk tea with half honey however I might try the brown sugar at some point. Then again, if it's great why change it right? 
I gotta say, in the world of bubble tea, I find Chatime's to be the best. 
Saying that, the total price for one regular sized tea with tapioca after tax is $5.31. It's quite overpriced for the type of drink that is is. 
Secondly, hygiene: I watched one of the staff members stretch while holding on to her shoe - one with each hand and then wipe her hands to her pants and then proceed to handle the shakers. (She didn't make my order). 
It started off as 5 stars and lost one for price and a second for hygiene. 
Great tasting tea though!"}
{"text":"Where Chatime really shines is in the actual tea drinks, because you can actually taste the tea. The standout is roasted milk tea. Get the drinks with as little sugar as you can, because they tend sweet. There's always a lineup at this location, so expect to wait at least 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"Chatime is my favourite bubble tea place. A safe bet is to go with their original roasted milk tea bubble teas. Right when you enter one you can smell the teas being roasted I LOVE IT! It's the best milk tea I've tasted around although some might argue with me. Line ups at  this location is always long reaching to the end of the restaurant, it's around a 10-15 minute wait.

I always get it with roasted jelly which is BOMB. I get 30% sugar but recently I've been going with 0% which I honestly think is just fine. Theres still a hint of sweetness from the grass jelly and the flavour is still there. Other drinks I really enjoy is the Oolong milk tea and the taro milk tea, both super good, taro especially. You can tasted the real flavour of the taro and the texture. Although I feel the texture of the taro has been watered down quite a bit since a few years ago."}
{"text":"Really good milk tea. The banana milk tea with pearls is good. Get it half sweet and no ice. I also have had the roasted milk tea with grass jelly (also half sweet and no ice). I wasn't sure if I would like the grass jelly, but it's great. One thing is that it floats so you don't get much of it until some of the liquid is gone. Next time I will get the pearls and the grass jelly since the pearls sink, that way I'll have yummy extras throughout the whole drink."}
{"text":"Chatime is a Taiwanese franchise bbt chain, and has over 800 stores worldwide. The company opened their first location in Toronto back in 2011, and that spot today is still very popular. Chatime has an extensive menu with lots of different drinks; signature milk tea, fresh tea, mousse, tea latte, QQ jelly drinks, smoothies, and more. It may not be the cheapest place for a cup of bubble tea, as it's a little more than $5 for a drink. However, I'd say that the quality of the products are definitely not lacking and the drinks are good. Customers are able to customize their order(s) to their liking as they're able to choose both the amount of sugar, and ice they want. The toppings are an extra charge (price varies) but they have a good selection of toppings from pearl, grass jelly, coconut jelly, red bean, aloe vera, rainbow jelly, pudding and malt. 

One of my favorite drinks has to be their Chatime Roasted Milk Tea (large is $4.70) with grass jelly. The drink itself is flavorful without being overwhelming strong. I often opt for the chewy tapioca balls, but I have come to like grass jelly quite a bit. I have been to both downtown locations, and I prefer the Annex one over the Dundas location. The one on Dundas (near Chinatown) is always bustling with customers, sometimes it's even through the door. The Annex location has much shorter lines, and the space has more seating. For those who like collecting points and rewards cards; Chatime has their very own loyalty program. They have partnered up with Vicinity Rewards Program and you can pick up the card at any Chatime locations. For every drink that you purchase at a participating Chatime location, you would get 1 point. For every 10 points earned, you can redeem for one free regular sized drink with one complimentary topping."}
{"text":"I stood in like for about a half an hour before I ordered but it was worth the wait!  I really like the fact that you can pick your ice ratio in your milk tea. I got the jasmine green milk tea with pudding and less sugar and it was amazing! I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're short on time but it's definitely worth the way if you decide to try it."}
{"text":"Really good, authentic Taiwanese bubble tea. When ordering you choose the sugar and ice level, which I find pretty interesting. More places should do that (especially with the sugar). I chose 50% sugar which tasted perfect (can't imagine how sweet it'd be if I had chosen 100). There are so many different tea flavors, and combinations, as well as toppings. The grass jelly was something I've never tried in my bubble teas before and I was pleasantly surprised how good it was. Hallelujah to discovering good boba!"}

I had the Matcha Milk Green Tea with Red Bean and pearls today. All I can say is, it's a good day!"}

{"text":"Try the roasted milk tea with grass jelly (or tapioca), jasmine milk tea, matcha red bean smoothie, and oolong black tea."}
{"text":"Over hyped and over priced are the two things that still lingers in my mouth after finishing my grass jelly drink that cost me $5 plus. I don't know why people are wiling to line up for their overpriced drinks when you can get a cheaper one across the street, is it because they put crack ?

However, like starbucks they allow you to choose the way how you want the drink to be which is probably what I like about the franchise only."}
{"text":"I was just visiting Toronto and found this Chatime across the street from my hotel. The taste was exactly the same as the ones in taiwan.  I would say the Franchise was done pretty well for the quality control.

Although the price is about 5 times than the one in taiwan, I still enjoy having a bubble tea in Toronto.  I specially like the red bean flavor."}
{"text":"Very good bubble tea, I usually drop in for a drink when I'm in the area. I like how you cam customize the amount of sugar and ice in your bubble tea"}
{"text":"I decided write you an email regarding my recent visit at Dundas Chatime location on Sept 7th around 3:45. The minute my friend grabbed her drink from the station, we bumped into a person who was exiting and dropped one of the drink. The cup cracked right in the middle vertically and spilled on the ground. Then we politely explained team leader what happened. And the team leader lady was able to clean up the floor for us without getting offered to remake the new drink. When we explained the cashier what happened, her answer was \"So?\". Then she continued, \"It's not our fault. You dropped it.\"  Then she responded, \"It's not a cafe here.\" I was very shocked by her response as Chatime is one of the biggest global beverage cafe in Asia and I have been a loyal customer since 2014. We were very embarrassed and upset from the way we were treated as a customer who shops at this cafe very often. I believe that Chatime is now a brand that represents bubble tea all over the world with greatest quality of beverage. However I realized that Chatime still has crucial employee education and concept missing here called \"customer service\". It was just one drink that you guys decided not to make today that made you to lose business from us and everyone who heard our conversation at the store and those would will read this review on all social media."}
{"text":"i will admit... first time i drank chatime ... i didnt know what the hype was about.. but then i got hooked and now im addicted.. thanks to all these people instagramming and facebooking every time they go like its a hidden treasure.

{"text":"Ever had that late-supper craving for a milk tea and charged off into the darkness of the night hell bent on getting what you want? 

You know what we're talking about. 

And when you swing open the door to Chatime at Dundas - what do you see? That's right. A line that not only reaches the back (where the washroom is) but not before a perfectly executed U-turn of tightly compacted human beings. 

That's why we are going to take a 1 star off you - and we're being generous. Time to expand the store Chatime!

But, of course, all is forgiven when we taste that sweet (30%) delicious, roasted milk tea with grass jelly."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places for boba milk tea I've ever gone to. It's definitely on the expensive side compared to what I'm used to in LA, but I've definitely had worse. Feels always compelling to get less ice as to get your money's worth on the milk tea ...otherwise it feels like there's too much ice. 

Yums."}
{"text":"Very good bbt, not the greatest people that work there. You can tell the employees are probably students on visas with no work permits, working over time, paid by cash. Lol I guess you can't blame them for being impersonal because of the volume they need to service and their somewhat lack of language ability."}
{"text":"I. AM. OBSESSED. 

I hopped on the purple Chatime bandwagon late.  I was initially resistant and didn't know what the fuss was about, because bubble tea, in my experience, was just so-so.  The first time I tried some was sometime in the 90s in a Taiwanese-owned shop in Pacific Mall.  It was very nice, but the quality steadily declined as all the cheaper places cropped up and I eventually associated bubble tea with overpriced, flavourless, sugary, diluted food colouring.

Then one of my best friends insisted I visit a Chatime with her after dinner one evening and I was hooked.  

The roasted milk tea was SO flavourful, rich, and unctuous! I adore tea and the tea flavour is so strong. I also like Taiwanese milk tea better because the flavour is smoother than HK milk tea, which is bitter.  Also, their roasted milk tea kind of reminds me of Japanese Kirin-brand Afternoon Milk Tea, which I love and never buy in Canada because it's expensive.

The taro milk tea actually had taro bits in it! The tapioca was so perfectly cooked! (Cheap places often overcook bubbles, which I hate - the inconsistency is one of the main reasons why I stopped having bubble tea.)

I was obsessed since that first trip and have been back regularly since, to the 3 locations closest to me.  I'm also glad that I'll be able to find a Chatime in most major cities! :D

That you can choose ice and sugar levels is the icing on the cake.  However, I have to say that sugar levels depends on the person making it.  I've been going to one of them enough to know how to adjust my order based on who's making the drinks.  I know, I know - I have a problem. :P

My favourite combinations:
*grass jelly roasted milk tea with tapioca
*roasted milk tea with pudding (their pudding is deliiicious!)

Honourable mentions:
*matcha latte (strong, good quality matcha flavour that's not too bitter)
*matcha mousse (but this one is a rare treat because it's very heavy and fattening - I believe it's made with cream; order it without toppings and have it on an empty stomach)
*taro milk tea (I love all things taro, but I love the roasted milk tea more so I have it more)
*red bean milk tea (not my thing but very good according to red bean fans)

Don't bother with:
*the QQ drinks - QQ is nata de coco, which is just so-so to me, and it makes all your drinks taste like lychee (even if you order the mango QQ, it tastes like lychee at the bottom)
*the vanilla, hazelnut, or coconut milk teas - they just add syrups, which makes the drink too sweet and doesn't really make the drink taste better
*oolong milk tea (it's ok - it's not available in every location so it's worth a try, but personally I like the stronger tea flavour of roasted milk tea)
*regular milk tea (roasted tastes so much better because it's stronger)"}
{"text":"Chatime  has the very best bubble tea. I wish they had more locations because this one is always very busy and it is narrow.  I order the coconut milk tea with tapioca (normal ice and sugar). Try it once and you'll love it"}
{"text":"I was in a walkable distance from Chatime which meant that I had to get some bubble tea. I'm sorta glad they don't have a store in Mississauga because then I would always want to get some lol.

There were a few customers ahead of me but the line moved pretty quickly. My friend, Daphne W., recommended the roasted milk tea with grass jelly and I have never tried anything different from Chatime since then. However, I did try the taro milk tea before and I thought it tasted gross. Today I decided to go with 80% sugar instead of 100% and I have to say that it tastes even better. After placing my order it didn't take very long for my drink to arrive in my hands.

Currently they have a new cup size which I think is RIDICULOUS. After the large size they have the super cup which is in regards to Fifa that is currently going on. The cup is so big that it looks like a high bowl. You would probably become diabetic after finishing that.

If you're in the area and are craving for some good BBT try out Chatime and not Bubble Tease (which is right across the street)."}
{"text":"I don't even like bubble tea but Chatime keeps me going back for more.
Please be sure to get Roasted milk tea with grass jelly (no ice, half sugar)

If there was a Chatime near my house i would go every week. This stuff is addicting!!!"}
{"text":"I'd have to say that I think this place doesn't taste as good as it use to. But still one of the better bubble tea places (especially for a franchise). 

Roasted rice tea milk tea with extra boba hits the spot sometimes (if they make it right). I usually ask for 30% sugar or less because otherwise it is super sweet. Overall, kind of inconsistent with taste leading to a hit or miss.  But their boba is pretty good, and unlike some places doesn't make you feel like you're chew on soft sugar cubes."}
