{"text":"This was ok. Not great but not horrible either. The sushi is good for a sushi fix, but I don't think it's as fresh as Saga normally is. The service was bad. I'm sure it was our section or something. But two tables that were seated after us were served before us. We're not that picky so it didn't bother us too bad, but it was at least 10 minutes before we got drinks. Other than that, if you're looking for a chain sushi place to get some ok food that will hold you over then this is good for that."}
{"text":"I love this place the staff are always so welcoming and friendly you get a lot of food for your money"}
{"text":"Loved the soup.  Food is just like Yokoso at the Waterfront.  

I agree with previous posters that it seemed like everyone was having a birthday!  And the loud music and disco ball were going when I arrived.  They have hibachi seating, or regular dining.  The hibachi seating was fun and energetic, so definitely not a choice for a quiet dining experience."}
{"text":"This is the most rude Hibachi place in Pittsburgh.  The waiter didn't answer anything about menu selection and sometimes answered in yes or no.  The Chef was in a hurry to wrap up and leave.  He too was rude and didn't put up that Hibachi experience.  Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Charlotte nc. The Japanese restaurant there are ok, meaning food wise. The food wise here was better. But the service was horrible. I swear the wait staffs look like zombies!! They weren't very welcoming nor polite. That totally ruined my mood. Then the habachi cook serves our food sloppy. I mean our food was literally pouring off the side of the dishes. What's worse, our whole table ordered filet mignon. I swear to you it was a mixture of reg steak. Filet mignon is suppose to be soft & melts in my mouth but this steak was very chewy & not it! Besides this the food was seasoned good & everything came out like its suppose to."}
{"text":"Horrible old food horrible costumer service food was so gross big mistake choosing this place"}
{"text":"Several weeks ago I was in Pittsburgh, PA on business.  I am a big sushi fan.  I had the spicy tuna roll at Ichiban.  The quality of the sushi was very good, service at the bar was good."}
{"text":"I want to preface this review by saying that my family  likes Ichiban, and we've been many times, and to all locations. In terms of food, our dinner visit was pretty good.

Unfortunately, considering all aspects, I am giving a 1-star review due to one receptionist's incredibly rude attitude. We went for dinner on Thursday, May 28. There were two receptionists when we went. One was very nice, and greeted us as we came and left. The other did not, and more. Right when we walked into the restaurant, she asked us \"how many?\" and \"hibachi or dining?\" in a clipped, I-don't-care-and-have-no-time tone when she wasn't busy. 

Next, after we were seated, she came back with more customers and demanded that we move one seat over to squeeze everyone in one table. I completely understand moving over to fit everyone - it wasn't our first time eating at hibachi and it happens. But, she basically told us \"you need to move right now!\"

In summary, this particular receptionist's overall poor and mean attitude towards customers is not acceptable for someone working at restaurant where she has frequent interaction with everyone. From body language to speaking tones, she did not act in a professional manner."}
{"text":"Ichaban is one of my favorite place for a date night or night out with friends! It's a nice dinner with plenty of time for socializing and conversation! Plus you leave full and with leftovers! The Hibachi Shrimp dinner is always my favorite, and a Volcano Roll of course! :-)"}
{"text":"Great prices and food! Awesome sushi menu.. awesome sushi lunch menu too great deal!"}
{"text":"The support person and chef at the Hibachi table we occupied were absolutely miserable. No smiles. No enjoyment of duty. No interaction with the nine people sitting at the table. 

We had a $100 tab for three people, with sushi on the side, for the equivalent of take-out fare. Everything was over cooked and under spiced.

If you are expecting a dining experience, put it out of your mind. Lower your expectations a good bit so as not to be as disappointed as we were."}
{"text":"Sushi rolls were fresh and tasty. We had the beauty and beast roll and the spiderman roll. Both had spicy tuna inside, but they weren't spicy enough. We went on a friday night, there was a 30 min wait for hibachi. Will definitely go back again and would like to try hibachi next time."}
{"text":"Awful experience. I sat at the sushi bar, the bartender (dirty blonde hair) insulted me immediately to start. I ordered a spicy Combo that comes with soup an salad. She just sat at the end of the bar and never brought them. I asked her if I was supposed to get them and she said nobody has ever ordered that.  She told me she's been there for a year and a half, there are like 4 things on the happy hour menu.  She says \"your sushi is almost done, do you even want soup/salad now?\". I said no to avoid having to speak to 'it' anymore.  She was the most vile thing that's crossed my path in over a decade.  Sushi was wet and tasteless. She never even offered to lower the price for her neglect.  

I actually shared this story with a bunch of people at the conference I was at as an example of how NOT to treat others, especially customers.  

Never again!"}
{"text":"Ichiban is a great experience. The hibachi table is the way to go for the fun of watching the chefs prepare your meal & entertain you. The food was great. I got the chicken & shrimp hibachi meal which is served with fried rice & lo mein.....DELICIOUS!! Everything was cooked just right.  You also get a small soup & salad included. I went there for my birthday, so I indulged & enjoyed an Ichiban Ice Tea cocktail. It was kind of like a Long Island Ice Tea but it had Saki in it instead of tequila....I enjoyed it a lot!  So to sum up..great food, with the addition of the entertainment of the hibachi chef & wonderful atmosphere, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I dined here on Friday August 5th with three colleges. 

I thought this was a strange place to be located in a strip mall. After reading some of the reviews I was hesitant - but wanted a good lunch before my flight (a business partner raved about their sushi roll lunch specials) I don't eat sushi but was assured I would find something I enjoyed. 

Upon entering they were rather busy for 1 PM , my friend said they close after lunch which I found odd. There were two girls working. One stated it would be about a 10-15 minute wait. The other recognized my partner & was very friendly with her, she said she would get us in once I expressed concern on missing my flight. She took us back almost immediately. This place is H U G E. Several cooking tables going and a large dining room. The room was very busy. We were brought waters quickly and asked if we needed some time before ordering. I ordered a hibachi chicken with rice. It was good, I liked the different dipping sauces it came with and the dressing on the salad was fantastic. My check came & I believe it was $10!! For all of that food, I realized why it was so busy. Despite how busy everyone seemed we got in and out in less than hour. When we left my friend joked with the host that she would see her in a few days. I will definitely return to Ichiban if I am in Pittsburgh again. 

My experience was almost the opposite of most reviews on here. * Excellent food and service from all employees I encountered and I didn't feel rushed at all. Even though it was lunch hour. 

Give them a try."}
{"text":"We had my nephew's 18th birthday at his favorite restaurant.  I had never been there and was surprised at the excellent hospitality.  From the hostesses, to the bartender, to the chefs and waite staff.  Owning a bed and breakfast makes me pay attention to service more than most diners.  Oh, and the food was excellent as well.  :)"}
{"text":"I've been to several hibachi style restaurants in the area and this is by far my favourite. The food is excellent. I am a huge fan of the soup and lo mein noodles. 

This is an excellent place to go with a group of friends. The chefs are entertaining and the staff has always been pleasant. If you aren't there with a group or for a birthday the atmosphere can be loud. its definitely not a place to go if you want to have a nice quiet dinner. 

Lunch is also incredible. You get a slightly smaller portion than the dinner menu for about half the price. 

Ichiban is definitely on my list of places to eat when I am back in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Food is good the appetizer and drinks for happy hour is such a great price! Our waiter was nice the only problem we have is the hostesses. There were 3 girls at the hostess stand. They didn't know when happy hour ended and did not look happy or even greet us when we came in or left.. I suggest management train those girls again on to how to be hostess you're dealing with customers, they were the reason why we ALMOST left. Only decided to stay because we were SO hungry."}
{"text":"Good place to eat. Had hibachi chicken and shrimp, tasted yummy. Also had \"Zambi\" cocktail which is also awesome. It was too much food for one person."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, mediocre food. I can't access any of my money thanks to these inconsiderate people. I ordered takeout for lunch and went to the restaurant to pick it up. As the hostess handed back my debit card after paying, she noticed that she had charged me the wrong amount and went to get the manager. I honestly assumed she had just made a small error, and being a hostess at a restaurant myself, I didn't make a big deal of it. Then I was informed that I was charged $112 for my $12 order, and the manager an hostess both nonchalantly assured me that the money would be restored to my card in 24 hours. I am absolutely incensed right now. I am a hostess at a restaurant and I'm a student. I live paycheck to paycheck and $12 for lunch was actually a pretty big splurge for me. $112 is more money than I even have on my card. Considering her mistake was a $100 difference, you would think that the hostess - and the manager for that matter - would be at the very least somewhat apologetic, but they treated it so casually. If I get charged an overdraft fee, they will be paying for it. Thank god I have gas in my tank because they literally took my entire paycheck. The staff of this restaurant visibly didn't care that they were screwing me over, and the food wasn't anything impressive. I will not be back."}
{"text":"The sushi here has the most variety and seems to be the freshest out of all of the Ichiban locations.

I would say to not go here for the teppanyaki as portions can vary, but it's not bad quality either, maybe it's just not my thing. 

I find that the board has something different every time I come here, which is awesome! I enjoy trying the new specials they have. The other locations keep their specials up for about a year or so, which gets old after awhile.

The tuna here is the best in the city, especially the way that they prepare spicy tuna, it is godlike. 

Above all, the prices for special rolls here are comparable to the waterworks location, and aren't ridiculous like the wexford one. Taking a star off only because sometimes the rolls end up being kinda small, but that might be just me."}
{"text":"Their food doesn't impress me perhaps because I'm from California and perhaps expect d more .I tried their tempura and the batter wasn't what I expected.  It's a bit dense and not light like what I am used to.  However, their service was fast and the server was polite."}
{"text":"This place is open, previously it was reported as being closed. Given the experience at this restaurant, they should really close. The employees were rude. And given that it has a Japanese name for a restaurant, they actually serve mediocre Chinese food. The only Japanese dish about this place is the udon, sushi, and tempura."}
{"text":"Meh.  Big portions but my sushi was flavorless.  Waiter wasn't very good.  Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"A great choice for Happy Hour apps snd cocktails at the bar. Cliff is sure to entertain you with his bartending talents and desire to please. Sushi rolls are among the best that I have had anywhere. Pricing is competitive, as well."}
{"text":"I have definitely had better!

A friend of mine decided to have her birthday dinner here. Ugh! Horrible experience. The staff was not friendly and was in such a rush. The Chef was nice but didn't talk to us much. He just joked a little and then was determined to finish cooking our meals. Probably rush to cook another table or go smoke, who knows! Our drinks were low during dinner, honestly we weren't sure where our server was?! 

I am not impressed with the amount of money you spend on these meals for the amount of food you get. The soup broth was kind of watered down, but the salad is always good. For the dinner portion, tiny shrimp, few pieces of chicken, steak, and way too salty fried rice. (This is where I needed my drink ) 

This is definitely a chain restaurant as I noticed that they have other locations. I had heard before coming here that it was Chinese owned. Just like the Saga restaurants are. The Chinese are taking over!! 

Overall, we all felt rushed and the service sucked. It's an in and out thing. Quickly serve, cook, pay, and get up so we can sit more people. Sure the inside decor is nice, but the food quality is not up to par! The birthday girl wasn't too happy but we made up for it later."}
{"text":"Ichiban sushi is tops. Always new maki roll combos added to menu with enough staple favorites like spicy tuna and yellowtail/avocado. Don't forget the house salad with ginger dressing. Food comes out quick but servers could be more prompt. I've visited the Robinson and Fox Chapel location equally and both are consistent. Too much of a sushi lover to try the hibachi. All in all Ichiban is one of the better sushi restaurants in the suburbs."}
{"text":"Went there for a birthday celebration. Not one smile from anyone on the staff. They didn't bring over the candle or turn on the lights as requested. I was embarrassed I brought someone there to celebrate their birthday. I will never be back and be happy to spend my $370 elsewhere. Oh and the chicken, fillets and salmon were all over cooked. Asked for water 3 times until going to get it from the bar myself. The hibachi chef was underwhelming to say the least. Is there anything good to say..we didn't have to wait to be seated because we had reservations."}
{"text":"Entrees look and smell good but you will be disappointed with the taste. I went around 5:30pm on a Monday and they were busy so I thought that was a good sign. Boy was I wrong! I took a couple bites and threw the rest away. That's how bad it was. Another review mentioned that it seems like they are serving leftovers. This is exactly how it tastes! 

Sadly, I haven't found any good places in this food court. Luckily, there are many restaurants in the mall."}
{"text":"I ate at the traditional side of the restaurant (though have been here and ate at the hibachi tables countless times and highly recommend it) and was very satisfied with the experience. Our waitress was super friendly and quick and the food was excellent as usual. The only thing that was sub-par was the salad someone who was with me got - it was made of iceberg lettuce and wasn't really anything special (but then again, who goes to an Asian restaurant and gets salad?). The sushi here is really good, and it was presented very creatively. Overall, I love this restaurant because of its friendly and fun atmosphere and of course, the great food. Give it a try sometime!"}
{"text":"The food here was just alright. The workers aren't very friendly and hesitate giving extra utensils and napkins. 

If you need to grab a quick bite to eat then I guess it's a convenient option. Definitely have had better though."}
{"text":"I came here for no expectations just because it's near the highway and we needed to stop and rested for dinner. But I enjoyed the best udon noodle soup I have ever had. I guess it was just chicken soup. But they made it very tasty and fresh in a natural way. Very good service, too!"}
{"text":"Terrible the worst service ever and the manager was no help. I told them it was a happy birthday party and I would pay for them to say happy birthday and bring out  ice cream and sparkles but it never happened. I will tell everyone I know to steer clear of the Robinson  ichiban"}
{"text":"Awful. My family was in town visiting and we decided to check out this place since it was near my house. I was a little nervous because of their ratings, but I always try to keep an open mind. First of all, they did not make the fried rice from scratch. He brought a bowl out and dumped it on the table. Second, the chef did not ask us how we wanted our steaks before cooking. I asked for medium, rare and it was thrown onto my plate overly well done. Thirdly, the service was so-so. They did not refill our waters and I felt like through the entire dinner we were scooted out. I will never come here again."}
{"text":"Ichiban is a fast food spot located within the Fashion Mall across from the Wynn.  The UFO shaped mall has a large food court with lots to choose from, but Ichiban is probably one of your best bets.  Ichiban is a Chinese fast food restaurant that serves quality and tasty food at a reasonable price.

Whenever I'm visiting Vegas, I make a point to stop by at Ichiban and get a plate of their delicious teriyaki chicken and vegetable fried rice.  The teriyaki chicken bursts with flavor as its drenched with their teriyaki sauce.  The chicken itself is tender, tasty, and nicely grilled and goes great with their fried rice.  In addition, the Mongolian beef is also worth trying and has a bit of spice to tingle the taste buds.

The food portions are large and more than enough to fill you up.  The cost of two entrees and fried rice is about $6 and after you add a drink, your total comes to about $8 and some change.  I highly suggest trying Ichiban; you'll love the teriyaki chicken."}
{"text":"It was lunch time so we decided to eat at the food court. I ordered the bento meal which had sesame chicken, teriyaki chicken and fried rice. When I took a bite of the chicken sides, they were cold and it seems like they are serving leftovers. Both of the chicken were tasteless and bland. The fried rice had no flavor.  You're best of eating Panda Express than this place. I'll never go and eat here again."}
{"text":"Rushed us out while we were eating!! Handed us our check while we were eating, and brought us to-go containers. My husband paid with his card and they took it immediately. I was tipping in cash as usual.... but didn't get a chance to put it in since I was STILL EATING!!! And they came over asking \" Why you no tip? You need to tip to pay for show!\" How rude!!! I was still eating!!! I told the manager who acted dumb just asking us who our waitress was over and over... we won't be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Ichiban at their Robison location, by far the best hibachi experiences I've had from my different hibachi trips.  Twice we've come in with large to very large parties and twice they were able to sit us within 10 minutes of our entire parties being present.  The first time it was 10 and the second time we had 14 people.

It is true that the Chef can make or break the experience as far as entertainment is concerned, but at the same time the food is so darn good I just want to be served and be left to EAAAAAT.

This time around I shared Chicken & Steak and it was both cooked perfectly to a tender and juicy medium while the seasoning made the meats POP.  The rice, noodles, and vegetables were all well made with the right amount of soy sauce, spices, and served piping hot.

The servers were super nice, a tad slow a times, but that's understandable if I'd been working all night long and then had a group of 14 people come in after 9pm I'd be a tad overwhelmed, haha.

I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"We'll never come back, we suffered food poisoning!!! We ordered sushi and smoothies and after an hour we were badly sick."}
{"text":"The like the food here. The sushi and hibachi are super good. The restaurant is always packed which is showing something good. 

The lunch special is delicious and reasonably priced. 


The host staff are not the most friendly and are not the most professional people. They would be the only part of the experience that I do not appreciate. Everything else about this place is pretty spot on."}
{"text":"So delicious! Go here for good food and a great time I promise you nor your stomach will regret it."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate our friends 30th birthday. You come here for the entertainment of the chef. And not once did our cook interact with us. Just quickly cooked. Burnt out food and left. As I spoke with the manager about the burnt filet I was served ( was to be cooked medium) he argued with me as it maybe burnt on the outside it will be medium in the middle. Lmao. Who argues with a customer. He said he would take it off my bill. And when I got the bill, of course nothing was discounted.  I then brought it to their attention again.  And they kindly took a whole $2 off my bill.  Wow. Thanks for nothing.  We won't be going back as saga is more entertaining and kinder to their customers..   and everyone had bad stomachs aches the next day. And that night. Maybe their food was bad as well. Idk."}
{"text":"Dined here today for lunch with 3 co-workers and I am 'definitely a fan'...  We sat at a table as we weren't all interested in tepanyaki.  Our waitress was very nice & pleasant, stopping by several times to refill our beverages while we waited for the 2 'late-comers' to arrive.  Co-worker 1 ordered Spring Rolls and they came out quickly.  The outside pastry was thin & crispy, cooked in the right temperature oil so as to not absorb any of it.  

I had the 'Pick 2' rolls ($12.95) and I chose the Eel Cucumber Roll and the Godzilla Roll.  The eel cucumber was stuffed with probably the largest piece of eel I have ever had in a roll and the surrounding rice was slightly warm with a delicious eel sauce drizzled on top.  This was VERY GOOD.  My Godzilla roll was filled with tuna, salmon, white fish & crabmeat lightly deep fried with tobiko & green onion on top with eel & hot sauces drizzled on top.  This one was EXCEPTIONAL...!    

For his entrée, Co-worker 1 ordered Yaki Udon ($10) with chicken and it came out rather bland looking.  He enjoyed it but I don't think I would ever order it after seeing it.

Co-worker 2 also ordered the 'Pick 2' ($12.95) and she picked a Tuna Roll and a Sexy Kimberly Roll.  The tuna roll looked stuffed with tuna and she said it was delicious but the Sexy Kimberly came out looking like the star of the show.  It had spicy tuna & avocado inside, salmon on top with hot sauce & tempura sprinkles on top.  She devoured that in about a minute.
  
My boss ordered 'Spicy Tasted' ($10) with shrimp, which was stir fried vegetables, shrimp of course, and a spicy hot sauce that looked delicious.  

All of our lunches came with soup or a salad and the 'non-sushi' ones also came with white rice.  
  
I will definitely be going back there..."}
{"text":"I love sushi, and Ichiban is my favorite place to get my spicy tuna rolls.  They have the freshest sushi in the area and it is worth the price!  The hibachi food is great also, and you always have plenty to take home as leftovers.  The service is otten hit and miss, but their pick up service is fast and efficient (only 15 minutes for a sushi order)."}
{"text":"A colleague and I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 5:45 pm. It wasn't terribly busy; there was one hibachi table that was filled with cooking underway, and we were seated at the adjacent hibachi table, where 2 other diners were waiting. Shortly afterwards, 3 other people joined and the waitress came around to take orders. My coworker and I both ordered the steak and shrimp mixed hibachi, which was only $1 more than steak alone.

We started with soups and salads while the chef came around a few minutes later and verbally confirmed orders. He was friendly and looked very skilled. The rice and noodles were cooked first, followed by veggies and meat. The portions were pretty huge. The chef took into account cooking preferences; other than asking how we wanted our steak, he was also obliging when one of the diners asked for her noodles and chicken to be cooked longer. The food was really flavorful; I found I didn't use much of my dipping sauces since the food was cooked with enough sauces for me. 

The restaurant was reasonably clean, as were the ladies' rooms. The staff were all very efficient with orders, busing tables, and checks. You could order food from the kitchen even if you were eating at the hibachi table. The restaurant was pretty big, with several tables and a good amount of seating.

Our meal came out to just under $50 (before tip but after tax). We didn't order desserts or drinks but the amount of food from the hibachi grill was generous. Amex accepted. Overall, a nice place to treat yourself to a fun and filling dinner, if you're willing to spend a bit more than at other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"12/05/16 visit.  My son wanted to eat here for his birthday.. UGH!!!   as in my last review, I am not a big fan on this place. Instead of getting the hibachi meal, since I didnt care for it last time, I decided to get a simple appetizer.  I got the Yakitori (Tender Chicken Skewers served with Teriyaki sauce).  For $5 I thought I would be bigger and better. just small pieces of onion and pepper. The chicken pieces was also very small. Then on top of that the chicken was over cook as it was dry and chewy. Also didnt have any seasoning on it. Also you can tell they just cook the chicken and then added the teriyaki sauce.. which of course just ran off the chicken and onto the plate. I would think they would baste or marinade the chicken in teriyaki. The sauce it self was very sweet and had a hint of teriyaki. 

In short t wasnt terrible but I wouldnt order it again."}
{"text":"My daughters and my mom went there last night. TERRIBLE TIME.  Waited over 1/2 hour to get soft drinks . Over 1 1/2 hours for good. Asked gor manager.  He wouldn't even admit that was wrong. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Came here last night for sushi and drinks. Nice ambiance. Talented sushi artists. Great sushi. I didn't expect it to be so expensive but it was definitely worth it. Ordered a few rolls, some teriyaki, clear soup and salad. Fell in love with the Friendly Roll and my boyfriend had the White Dragon roll. Both pretty good. The ginger dressing was one of the best I've had. I'd gladly go back."}
{"text":"The hubby and I have come here quite a few times. This time we sat at the bar. We came for the dinosaur egg. It's our favorite thing, we each got our own! We also shared a seared white tuna app, seared tuna app, takosu, shumai, and maybe another thing or two. Everything was great, per usual. Our bartender Cliff, was awesome. We had lots of questions about drinks and was always curious of what he was making, as me made multiple different cocktails for the servers. We got to taste a few different specialty cocktails, every single one was good. He told me about a Bloody Mary he invented called a \"bloody samurai\", A Bloody Mary with sake, soy, and wasabi, GENIUS! Being the bloody lover that I am, I ordered it, great! The whole experience was great, and we can't wait to come back for more dinosaur eggs! Now we know that if Cliff is on the bar, that's where we'll be sitting!"}
{"text":"I usually eat at the bar so I can't comment on the hibachi service, but service by Cliff at the bar always spot on. Great happy hour specials (1/2 off all appetizers). Sushi is always prepared with quality ingredients, but the preparation is different in different days depending who's slicing the fish. One chef has fantastic knife skills and works magic with the fish by slicing very thin and consistent making the fish melt in your mouth. If this chef were the only one slicing the fish I would probably give them 5 stars, but the other guys are a bit ham fisted and leave the fish a lot thicker and over sauce the plates too. Overall it's a very good place and I head there more often than my check ins show. So swing by, pay Cliff a visit, a have a a New York grill appetizer with the yellow tail...you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places, hibachi dinner or sometimes just for sushi.  The staff are always kind and eager to serve.  The sushi chefs really care about the art of sushi, reflected in the presentations."}
{"text":"First off, the food was just fine, huge portions of carbs and a decent bit of meat and veg for each person. The waitress was awful though, she took forever to bring our drinks (wine, beer, a water and two kids juices, nothing fancy) and then we never saw her again until she was helping the attached  table and I flagged her down to get seconds, but by the time they arrived we were nearly done and ended up sucking it down at the last minute. The chef was \"meh\", we have been to quite a few of these kinds of restaurants and this was a bit of a disappointment comparatively. Most of the food was (except the steaks) cooked to the max or over cooked. Not what I expect for this amount of money!

One bright spot was the sushi we got. My 5 year old likes to get some so I went with a rookie version of sushi with the tempura shrimp roll and it was really great!! We both LOVED it!

Oh and GPS cannot find the place either! We tried the TomTom and my phone and we finally just turned in to a strip mall and then we finally found it. What a pain."}
{"text":"Service wasn't great but the food and habachi experience were excellent. Had steak and shrimp habachi. It comes with a side salad, soup, noodles, rice, and vegetables. A lot of food. The steak and shrimp were cooked to perfection. The rice and noodles, although greasy, were tasty. The sauces were delicious. Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"Nice lunch spot in the Fashion Show Mall that is close to where I work. Everytime I have eaten here the food is always fresh.The sesame chicken and the teriyaki are very good and I like their rice. I judge Asian places on how well they can make rice. I know this is weird but I can't stand rice that isn't soft and fluffy. If I can't pick it up with chopsticks it is a no go for me. It seems recently they have been offering a small sushi selection. I ordered some inarizushi and was surprised when the clerk told me it would be about 5 minutes. Not only did they make it right then but they made it the way I like it. Inari needs sesame seeds and they did it right!"}
{"text":"I *really* like Ichiban, and I really didn't think I would. I have not tried their hibachi, but the sushi is tasty. Many of the rolls are sauce-heavy, which I'm partial to. It's been suggested to me that this sauciness may mask the quality of the other ingredients, but I don't care, it's TASTY to me.

What's good:
Angry Dragon Roll
Monster Roll
OMG Roll
Volcano Roll
Gyoza Soup

What's \"just ok\":
Service (based on a single visit)
Decor/atmosphere
Noise level

They also do something REALLY cheesy for birthdays, complete with disco lights and crazy song.

I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Holy amazing! So fast, friendly and delicious! I highly recommend the Angry Dragon roll to everyone."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  Meal prices were slightly above average for meat and rice, but alcohol was super inexpensive!  $4 for wine.  $2 for domestic drafts.  My friends and I enjoyed the meal and the show all though I think it could have had more flare."}
{"text":"You can get the same taste at your local mom-and-pop Asian restaurant at much cheaper prices. Ichiban is the kind of place that you come to for service and entertainment. At this particular location, you'll get great service in a fun atmosphere! Good flavor and friendly service at reasonable hibachi prices."}
{"text":"This is only for the Robinson location.  I order sushi takeout about once a month from here. I have to say, the lunch specials are fantastic and my rolls have never disappointed.  I have tried many rolls on their menu, but my favorite and now my standard is the Fresh Green Roll (cucumber, asparagus, and avocado) and the Friends Roll (shrimp tempura and avocado, topped with spicy crab).  However, I get my friends Roll made a little healthier without tempura.  My mouth is giddy just thinking about it.

I have never been here for anything other than lunch special sushi takeout. 

I've been to the Wexford location for the same sushi and it was not nearly as good as the Robinson spot.

1/12 - went again today. The ginger dressing was amazing today. The fresh green roll was perfect. I also tried the sweet potato roll, which I felt could have used more sweet potato.  I've been mother places that make it pretty decent and use minimal rice, whereas this one was more rice, less yam. Still, I liked it, but probably wouldn't get it again.

8/15/16 Update...My new addiction here is the green phoenix appetizer with a seaweed salad. Hear me now, thank me later. Mouthgasm!!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't crazy about this place. It's pretty much your typical hibachi restaurant. The food was greasy and I felt sick afterwards. As far as hibachis in the area go, I prefer Saga."}
{"text":"A very close friend of mine took me here for dinner on a Saturday night, it wasn't crowded at all and we were seated right away at a hibachi table.  Our waiter was very polite, he went over the menu with us since it was our first time here.  We had to wait for other people to be seated at our hibachi table before the show could be started.  We ordered the steak and shrimp and vegetables with a side of rice and noodles.  With your meal you get a soup and salad.  Everything was delivered to our table promptly and was nice and hot.  Finally our chef came to our table and did a show on the hibachi, he was very nice, professional and did a great job. Once our food was finished and we started eating me and my friend both agreed that our food could have been seasoned better it was lacking some seasoning and the steak was a little tough for a medium well steak.  All and all the staff was great, but the food was lacking, I actually didn't finish all of my food and just took the rest home.  I have been to Sakura in Monaca, PA and I love their food so I think I will just continue to go there."}
{"text":"Sushi!    I have been on a real sushi kick as of late.

The pro's -

I have been to this location twice.   

First Trip:  I have tried the Shrimp Udon Noodles (a favorite).    The kitchen prepared a dinner order instead of the lunch order.  The meal was very good with a good balance of shrimp and vegetables with my thick udon noodles.    The meal sent me in to a carbohydrate coma for the afternoon.  I split an Angry Dragon Roll with my grouop.    One of the better sushi combinations I have had.

Second Trip:   

Sushi Night -    I order the Angry Dragon Roll, Spicey Sear Ahi Tuna, and Yellow Tail and Jalepeno (in a Cilantro sauce).    All were very delicate and yummy.

Service - 

I have always sat at the bar.   The bartenders both times were engaging when we initiated conversation.     They provided great detail on the sushi orders and good advice.

Price:   Lunch will run you around $12 for Udon Noodles, Sushi is priced anywhere from $9 to $14 per roll / plate.    Overall a good experience.

Atmosphere - This is the ding on the place.   This is a birthday to go place for kids.   They do a lot of things to celebrate birthdays with sparklers and disco lights.   You cannot avoid the spectacle even if you are sitting at the bar.    The second night I went to the restaurant - the disco light show was on so much that I felt I was at a night club (but all the lights were on - so ...  It was just a lot of noise).

All and all - I will be back for lunch to avoid the night time spectacle for sushi!"}
{"text":"We'd never been there for hibachi and only dined there once for sushi (not very impressive). Friends got a group together and we were very impressed with the service and the food at the hibachi. We hadn't had hibachi in almost a year, but we do enjoy it and this was delicious. A TON of food (as usual with hibachi) and the sushi roll we got was better than we remembered the sushi being last time. We're definitely going to have to give it a try again for sushi."}
{"text":"I kept my Yelp fans waiting for this one for way too long.  Long story short, solid experience my Friends!

The decor is a little aged but it fits in nicely when they drop the disco ball lights and hit the music for the in-house birthday celebrations...  This was a little on the wacky side but still gets a chuckle or two out of me.  Yeah, you need to see it to believe it.

The food was terrific!  The steamed edamame are now a go to of mine as a hibachi appetizer, many thanks to my experience at Ichiban.  But what really resonates with me still to this day was the fried rice!  A nice hearty supply of rice with fried egg that really packs a punch.  Next time I may skip the veggies and go double rice.

This place had some decent traffic on a weekday evening as well.  Tucked a way in a retail strip center this bodes well as a sign of approval from the locals.

Service was decent and the chef was friendly and put on a good show.  The waiter, although not for a lack if effort, struggled to keep up with the water refills.   In addition to the water, they also serve my favorite Japanese beer, Kirin Ichiban!  Ichiban means \"number one\" in Japanese and very fitting to end my review of Ichiban on that note."}
{"text":"Tastes like straight up garbage. Don't do it. They should be out of business. The udon and chow mein tastes really funky."}
{"text":"YUM!

Don't go to the Panda Express. It kinda sucks. If you are making a decision between the two \"Asian Influenced\" food court places at Fashion Show Mall, this one is most definitely the better of the two.

They not only have better tasting food, but I happen to think the quality is great too. They also have more unique and interesting choices here as opposed to Panda Express like tofu, seaweed salad, tempura shrimp and sushi.

Always friendly service, and quick as well."}
{"text":"Great spot for a team work lunch, which is how I ended up here midday on a Friday.  Pretty empty around 11am, though it had definitely filled up by the time we left about an hour and a half later.  Not a super impressive hibachi presentation or anything, but the food was decent enough for an office occasion.

The CLEAR SOUP had full flavor, though it was pathetically accented with about 4 shavings of the thinnest mushroom slices I have ever seen, as if they had been turned out with a truffle shaver.  The SALAD was a crisp, fresh pile of iceberg with a few wisps of carrot, and my HIBACHI VEGETABLES were coated with a perfectly palatable sweet teriyaki sauce that tasted very much of the thick slab of butter I watched the cook fry them in.  

Simple, super-Americanized hibachi.  What you see is what you get, literally.  I'm sure I'll be back, and I'm not mad about it."}
{"text":"After a long day of shopping my mother in law and I stopped in for dinner. We were sat right away at a table with for other people that had already gotten their salads and soups. The server taking our food was in a rush for us to order. I said we needed a minute. Two minutes later she came back and said \"ready now\" with an attitude. We were easy to order but it was the way she spoke to us. We didn't feel very welcomed. A minute later she dropped off outlets salads and soups and disappeared. Through out the meal other serves we're filling our water glasses. When the table was finished the other to groups got their checks right away as we waited. And when we did get our check it was incorrect and when we told her she just took it and walked away. At that point I said to my mother in law \"wow her attitude sucks\". My mother in law paid the check, as we were walking to my car the server followed us out and asked about her tip. That she served us and where was her tip. My mother in law said no that's right. And the server yelled at us not to come back so she doesn't have to serve us. I'm in complete shock"}
{"text":"FYI, count your change.  I was at the Robinson resturant for lunch last week.  Lunch was great.  When I paid the waiter, I handed him a $50 bill.  When I counted my change, it was short $5.  The waiter opened his folder and handed me the $5.  He knew it was short.  Another thing the waiters are doing, is not giving you your coins.  I don't care how much it is, it's still stealing.  Remember to check your bill and count your change."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Ichiban. I've only been to the Robinson location so I can't compare it to the other locations in the area. I personally believe that the hibachi chefs put on a great show. 

My go-to is the hibachi chicken but I've also tried their shrimp & lobster. The hibachi meals come with soup, salad with their delicious dressing, noodles, rice and your meat choice (or there is a veggie option) I'm literally obsessed with the shrimp sauce.. yum!! 

Service from the servers are sometimes spotty. Friday when we were here, i think the girl became overwhelmed. She messed up some drink orders & forgot others. the next thing you know a new server came along. The hibachi chefs and the food make up for the servers. 

I've never tried their sushi so i can't comment on that. I love the hibachi meals so much that i just stick with them."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and it was packed!  Don't be fooled by  the unassuming restaurant-front, cuz' the inside is nicely decorated in Japanese style.  Good food but the service was ok.

FOOD:  We started with sushi - the Volcano roll which is a deep fried tuna, crabmeat, and cucumber rolled and then deep fried with a couple different sauces(server's recommendation).  The whole sushi is hot in temp. and a bit spicy from the sauces, but a great combination!  We had the Yaki Udon shrimp which is thick noodles sauteed with shrimp and vegetables.  Yummy!  And the Seasoned Vegetable which is an assortment of vegetables sauteed in brown sauce served with rice.  Another good dish!  Overall, the food was good and I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Iced tea - 1 star - It tasted as if it had something rancid in it. 
Clear soup - 3 stars - It tasted good, but unfortunately the waitress took it away before I finished it.
Salad - 4 stars - It had an OK dressing.
Steak and shrimp hibachi - 4 stars - Good but not the best that we have ever had.
Steak and scallops teriyaki - 4 stars - Steak was slightly fatty but tasted good."}
{"text":"I was here on 7/11 for Dinner with my Boyfriend and my niece. I contacted the restaurant first and got no response, so I am leaving this review. I use to come to this restaurant 2-3 times a month...I can say it is more like twice a year now, and This will be my last time here. We came because my niece wanted to go there. Let me tell you how horrible it was. The Chef was not entertaining, to me that is all part of the \"show\" to say. He was not fun at all. The waitress was so miserable and seemed to hate her life...she took our order and came back with the salads and soup. The chef came out and was starting to cook and there was another waitress behind him taking orders at the other table, our waitress somehow squeezed in between them and asked for everyone to pass their bowls down through us to hand to her instead of walking around the table like any other person would of done. She refilled drinks the same way passed everything through my boyfriend, to me, to my neice and so on down the table. We were not a big group of people, we did not know the other family sitting with us. While all of this was going on she coughed a few times right over the food cart, pretty gross and unappetizing right? I told myself there is no food right on top and there was a sandwich of people so hopefully the germs never made it to the food. I was very annoyed when it was all said and done I ate a few peices of my filet but really could not bring myself to eat. I asked for a to go box...figured at least my dog would get some filet mignon out of this.  When I received the check I paid and I did not tip because to me this is extremly poor service. I waited till my niece was done with her drink, we got up and started to leave. The waitress came running into the parking lot telling me I forgot to leave her tip. I told her I did not forget, the service was horrible and I did not think anyone deserved a tip.  Not to mention, last time I checked it is my option to leave a tip. You do the job you are supposed to and not be lazy than absolutely I have no issue leaving you a 20% tip. I can assure you I will not be back I will drive to Washington to Fusion."}
{"text":"The service was awful, the waitress did not give me the correct change back and when I asked about she said it was correct and still did not give me the correct changes and overall it was an awful experience"}
{"text":"My husband and I was invited to my goddaughter's 21st birthday dinner here last night February 24, 2017. It was the second worst experience in my 36 years at a restaurant. We sat at the bar with the birthday girl's dad since she or her other guests hasn't arrive yet. I ordered a strawberry daiquiri it was not good. It tasted nothing like a good strawberry daiquiri I had at other places like TGI Friday's, Red Lobsters, or my own. There was a confrontation with one of the hostess and my goddaughter (was not present for that interaction), but the hostess kept walking pass giving my gd a dirty look. We were seated and the first thing I noticed was the waiter was sitting the menu in each plate. That's so nasty there's so many germs on those menus and you would sit one in a plate were the food going to go. I already knew I was asking for another plate. The table was not wiped off well leftover sauce and hard noodles in the crack. The waiter came over to take our ordered that was horrible my husband tried to order by the number and the waiter did not know which meal it was, so my husband had to tell him. The soup and salad was served after 15 minutes of being seated (it was an average crowd) my soup had nothing but liquid no mushrooms or onions the salad was okay. We had to move so they could have two chefs (there was 11 of us). The first chef already started, the second one started 5 minutes later. We always wait until all the food is done to pour our sauces on and eat. The chef was not entertaining and too slow cooking the food, so by the time I went to eat my rice and noodles it was lukewarm/cold, but I was so hungry I just start eating. It was just ok it was not a lot of food. I had the shrimp and scallops, but it was about 6 shrimps and 6 scallops a handful of rice and noodles. Our bill was $76 and some change not worth it for the amount of food and service 18% was already on the check because we was in a party of more than 6. Maybe their reason for lack of service. I went to the ladies room before leaving it smelled like pee and toilet paper was all over the floor a very nasty bathroom. On our way out saying bye to the birthday girl dad the hostess that had the confrontation with my gd and the other two hostess was upfront at their podium. I observed the one just staring at us all crazy as we were saying our goodbyes, so I asked her was everything ok she did not say a word she just nodded her head yes and asked are you sure she nodded yes (just strange and weird). I was so over it that I went back in and asked for the manager. Speaking with him about his staff was like talking to a brick wall. I've been a manager no way would an employee of mines would have a confrontation with a paying customer and still be standing there. It was no use in speaking to the manager. It was my first and last time at that location. If I find out the one in Waterworks is owned by the same in Robinson I will never go to that one again as well. I went to the Waterworks location 4 times and always a great experience. I will make sure to tell family and friends to never eat at the Robinson location. She should had it at Saga like her dad wanted to do! SN: As we were still eating they came over with to go containers,no way of knowing if we were finish eating. I felt rushed, Iike they wanted us to go and they did not sing happy birthday as well."}
{"text":"Our new favorite sushi restaurant ! We are usually pretty bias about trying new sushi places but we decided to go a new route this particular date night since ichiban offers drinks. We were not disappointed! Based on the outside look of the this place, I would have never guessed it was as large of a restaurant as it was. There was a bar seated area, sushi bar seated area, middle of the road seated area , and hibachi grill area! So many table and was getting busy. We sat in the dining area but I absolutely hate middle of the room seating so asked to move. Hiding in a booth is our desired location ! We strictly came for sushi and drinks so I cannot comment on the hibachi. However, good sushi is hard to find and the specialty rolls were really done well. We had the ichiban and monster roll and they were awesome. We also ordered a sashimi and sushi entree and that's mainly why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5. Some of the sashimi was  maybe not super fresh as it could be but not horrible either. The silky smooth and melt your mouth deliciousness of sashimi every bite was lacking. On a good note, my Appletinj martini was prepared on point and they had a nice cocktail selection.How we feel about our experience at restaurants is 50/50 when it comes to food and customer service. Our server Chris was very helpful and attentive. We will certainly be returning to Ichiban again."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and loved it! Definitely up there with some of the best sushi we've had. Not only was the food good, but the staff was friendly and the place was clean- big plus! Prices were a little high but when it comes to sushi, I'm willing to spend a little more if it means quality food.  And, an added bonus, when he brought us our check, we got a reusable discount card to use with pre5y generous discounts. We'll definitely be going back.. Maybe try the hibachi next time!"}
{"text":"Food was great! 4 stars is for waitstaff. Sat at the bar for a bit before dinner.. It took probably 15 minutes for another employee to go find the bartender for us. They did have a good happy hour though, both drinks and appetizers. Calamari and Rangoons were really good! Then went to hibachi table for dinner and server was fine but the chef was hardly entertaining. He looked like he hated his job. At least the food made the experience totally worth it!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"First off, I'll say that our server was awful. When he brought out the drinks he was guessing on what was in each glass (the table had 8 different people). He gave my boyfriend's drink to a stranger across the table who gave it back. It looked like he was about to offer the drink to my boyfriend then, when he spoke up and said just bring me another one. He waited over 10 minutes for his new drink. The chef was already at our table before he actually got his drink!! 
The food was okay. Not particularly full of flavor like other hibachi grills I've visited, but not bland either. I got the chicken and steak dinner, I thought both meats were kind of chewy, which I didn't like. 
We also got the Volcano Roll sushi. It was amazing. I must say the sushi is on point!!"}
{"text":"Food is always amazing! Great sushi menu and the hibachi is my favorite out of any hibachi place I've ever been to. The only down side to this place is the staff. Very very very rude hostesses every single time! Plus, the waiters don't really listen to what you order half the time. Most chefs are nice, however one time I had a chef named Tom who not only got my order wrong, but yelled at me and told me I didn't actually order what I wanted. I hate going back and getting Tom as a chef, but the food is so yummy!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to Ichiban for lunch on a Wednesday and had a great Hibachi meal.

We absolutely love Hibachi and have tried just about every Japanese Steakhouse in Pittsburgh, but Ichiban might just take the cake for the best Japanese Steakhouse in Pittsburgh. 

We arrived to Ichiban for a late lunch at about 2 PM, hoping that we could still get Hibachi, considering their lunch stopped at 2:30 PM. As soon as we walked in the Hostess asked us if we'd like sit-down or Hibachi; after we said that we wanted Hibachi she communicated to the other Hostess that we would be the last Hibachi lunch. So try to get there before 2 PM for lunch! It's worth it.

We were guided into the dining area which was a full house! At 2 PM on a Tuesday! That was a good sign. We were seated at the only available table w/ 4 other guests and ordered immediately. 

We both ordered the Chicken and Shrimp Hibachi lunch which was $16.95. The lunch portion is served w/ soup, salad, rice, vegetables and noodles! The Chef came out right away and cooked our entire meal in less than 30 mins. We were eating by 2:30 PM. Lunch is less of a show, so not as many tricks as dinner, the Chef just got straight to business. 

The food was great. The shrimp were large and filling. In comparison to other Hibachi restaurants in the area, I think that Sapporo's Special chicken has more flavor than Ichiban's chicken but everything else was much better. Ichiban's sauces tasted great on the noodles and rice.

Our waiter, Vivian, made sure that we had everything we needed and provided us excellent customer service. We finished eating our meals around 3 PM and even as the restaurant was closing she didn't make us feel rushed at all. 

We will definitely come back to Ichiban the next time we are craving Hibachi. Judging by how busy their lunch is, we'll probably make a reservation for dinner."}
{"text":"Consistently great sushi and service. I haven't had the hibachi because I personally don't care for hibachi, but i love the sushi! It always tastes fresh and they are generous with the sake. love it."}
{"text":"I've eaten at my fair share of Japanese restaurants, and I gotta say, I was pretty impressed by the food. Very nice presentation, good quality fish, and decent portions. Needless to say, I did not leave hungry. 

PROS: food, parking lot, nice place to go after a day of shopping around Robinson

CONS: a bit noisy w/ people cheering, clapping, and loud music (which can be fun), but not overbearing, $$

will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Flew in from dallas absolutely starving and drove around looking for thai or sushi.  I wound up here for one reason...it had the most cars parked out front.  I started out with seaweed salad and two rolls, standard rainbow and the dragon roll.  I would tell you what was in it but I am so miserably full right now I just dont have the energy.  Really solid sushi, no complaints.  Presentation was done well and it was very fresh.  

Finished up with the udon noodles with soup and salad.  Very serviceable and fulfilling.  Did I eat too much? Yes.  Do I regret it? Yes.  Bartender was super nice and food was about as good as sushi gets in Pitt.  

I will be back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here when we want sushi. I've lived in Japan for a while so it's hard to find a sushi place that I like. This isn't the best place but it's better than most. I do like the habachi here better than the other places we have gone to eat at."}
{"text":"Noodles were disgusting. Like spiced top ramen. They ruined everything. Anything they touched. Teriyaki chicken was nothing special. Sesame chicken had a bone in it. Drinks are way overpriced. Egg drop soup alright. There's a reason there's no line for this establishment."}
{"text":"The food was not bad.  The portions were huge. The service was horrible. We had a party of five and we paid the $24 buyout to have your own table. Our drinks were never refilled. We were rushed out. We haven't even finished eating and they put our checks and  to go boxes on the table. They came back to the table at least 10 times to see if we had signed the receipt. It also wasn't near closing time. Because we were basically pushed out.... I will not return. 
They were not that busy and they acted like it was a huge inconvenience because we wanted to do the buy out on the table."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that Ichiban is really not a good place to eat. Actually, the whole food court in the mall could be way better on a deeper level! If you're planning to eat here, or really intent on eating here...I would say that their best out of all dishes would be the chicken teriyaki. 

On my plate, I had the chicken, noodles, and shrimp tempura. All of it was painstakingly dry and not very well seasoned. None of it was really that warm either. I'm probably not ever going to eat here again. On the plus side, the people working here were very polite and nice! 

The food court is one of the worst places to eat in the entire Fashion Show Mall. FSM, please reinvent your FC, because the place is just too big to be -that- bad."}
{"text":"Ichiban is not the mall version of a  live action hibachi spot that I hoped for; it is more of a grassroots Panda Express. It is a quick bite at a reasonable price when you're on a shopping mission. I opted for vegetables instead of noodles or rice, and for my two entrees teriyaki chicken and eggplant. The vegetables had an off-putting flavor. I would not make that call again. As with this type of spot, the eggplant dish was heavy on the sauce, but had a nice flavor, and the chicken was flavorful and tender. So, of my three dishes one was not good, one was aok and one was solid. You may have better results elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ichiban is a funny place.  Seem to end up here a couple of times a year.  Went for a birthday party during the week.

1. Was not crowded but they always make you wait, not matter if early, late or on time.  

2. Depending on chef it can be a blast or OK.  Chef tonight was not very good or entertaining.  In the past usually very good.

3. Servers can be slow or fast.  Server was rushing everything, must have been in a hurry to leave.  Also, he had a hard time understanding everyone.  In the past, servers were good but usually slow and if you wanted a drink refill, forget about it for about 20 minutes.  

4.  Food can be real good or oh so average.  In the past was surprised how good it was.  This time, shrimp overcooked and did not seem fresh, how long was it in the freezer?

5. Steak, better hope everyone wants it cooked the same method, especially since they slice it up, usually get it med well since that is the way someone orders it even though asked for medium rare.

We still had fun.  But why are they so inconsistent.  Visit before this one was much better."}
{"text":"I work in the mall, so it is hard to find a good, affordable place to eat. Ichiban offers a plate with fried rice and two sides for $5.89 + mall discount which is unbeatable. Not only do they have good prices but their food is flavorful and generously portioned. Try the chicken curry....it is some of the best.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Convenient location within fashion show mall, it provided a mixed categories of so-called Chinese and Japanese cuisines, but you could not expect too much from the food court. Reasonable priced items."}
{"text":"Really great Hibachi experience. I love that you get fried rice and noodles. Not a lot of showmanship at our table. My friend and I talked but it would have been disappointing if it was a first time experience.  Not s fan of the dressing on the salad.  I prefer other hibachi restaurants I've been to.  I ordered the steak and chicken combo and it was really yummy. Nothing was overlooked. He kept the yum yum sauce refills coming! It was nice not having to ask."}
{"text":"Very good experience on our first visit. We arrived (for sushi) at 7:45p on a Friday night and were seated immediately. Service was friendly, relatively fast, and overall good. We shared three rolls: Volcano, OMG, and Las Vegas. As another reviewer said, the volcano roll is tasty but heavy on the sauce. However, it (and everything we ordered) was exactly as described on the menu. If you're not into a lot of sauce, read the menu carefully as the volcano roll has three different sauces!
Overall we were impressed with the service, selection, presentation, and taste of our food. We would not hesitate to have sushi here in the future."}
{"text":"Truly one of my favorite Japanese steakhouses. I have been to the one in Peters Twp and I can tell you that the Friends Roll (sushi) is so ridiculously good that I get it every time. The hibachi filet comes with both fried rice and noodles. Both are really good and flavorful. Plus the Peters Twp location is immaculate and beautifully done. I will try all Ichiban's around the city any time I am near. 
Dionne Malush, Pittsburgh Realto"}
{"text":"Great Maki rolls. I stopped for lunch while shopping and had two rolls and they were delicious. Especially the Osaka roll which was yellowtail and tuna with avocado. It was wonderful."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi I've had. Ordered tuna sushi, Philadelphia rolls, dragon rolls, las Vegas rolls, and shrimp tempura rolls. Also had an excellent miso soup and mango Mochi ice cream. All were incredibly tasty and delicious. I wish I wouldve ordered their tuna sashimi. Buttery, fresh and delicious. Well worth it, considering their location at the basement of the Bally's."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I just checked it out on Friday and really enjoyed it.  The spicy tuna roll was excellent and I couldn't stop talking about it.  We sat down for dinner in the hibachi side and all of the food we had was excellent.  The soup could have been better, tasted like broth.  Other than that, excellent place for dinner."}
