{"text":"The rustic atmosphere was nice, the food and drinks were great, and the service was awesome. I don't usually order steak in burritos because the meat is tough, but their steak was so tender and absolutely delicious...I'm glad I took the waiter's recommendation and tried it."}
{"text":"We had a groupon for this place and were in the area so we decided to cash it in.  We sat at the bar.  It took a little bit for someone to notice us but after that the service was great.  The food was ok.  Not anything I would seek out again but our friends mentioned they go here for happy hour and love it so we would definitely try it again with them.  We started with the Papi's trio.  The salsa was great, the guac was great, but the queso dip was not very good.  Too much spinach.  I ordered the grilled chicken entree.  A little too much oil but nicely seasoned.  It's worth trying."}
{"text":"Groupon continues to impress! Date night at a new place for us was an inexpensive treat. The salsa, tortilla soup & refried beans are DELISH!  The SpeakEasy Comedy club was a great addition to the evening.  Comedians had good edgy jokes even though my date & I were the ONLY MEXICAN/LESBIAN couple in the house!  Friday date nite: great company+food+drinks+comedy=sure thing! ;)  jus sayn"}
{"text":"We have been here 4 or 5 times and food is really great! Service has been just okay, but tonight we had Devin as our waiter and he was FANTASTIC! He was exactly the facelift the customer service experience was in need of!!! Request him-he made great suggestions and was really attentive. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Im staying at the hotel here where papi chulos is at. I just looked here on yelp and noticed the hours of operation. Now I am very irritated. I was absolutely starving, had not eaten all day, I got settled into my room and rushed over to the restaurant to get some dinner before they closed, I walked into the place at 930. After standing at the host stand for 10 minutes without even being acknowledged by any of the employees,  I walked up to the bar and asked one of the staff members if they weren't seating anymore tables for the night ( there were 2 tables outside w guests and 1 inside and a nearly full bar ). Mind you ,it's now almost 945 and I've been there nearly 15 minutes. I was told 'oh no, the kitchen actually closed quite a while ago'. Okay thank you, and I left. I then had to walk a little over a mile to get something to eat. I was just thinking about how wierd it is, I don't know of any restaurants in the entire city that close before 10 any night of the week. Well here I look at the business hours and they are in fact open until 10 on Thursday.  What happend?  How crappy is that? The hotel's restaurant won't serve a guest 20 minutes before closing time. I will never be eating or staying at this establishment ever again"}
{"text":"Happy Hour and a sunset?  Yes!  Our party consisted of my wife, myself, and our preschool aged son.  We had just finished a long day of touristing (yes, obviously from my location, we are visitors) and needed dinner.  We were originally planning on another location down the street, but that other venue's parking lot was full.  We had seen Papi Chulo's on the way in, and decided to head there after our original plans were denied.  And it's a good thing too.  The chips were fresh and warm, and the two salsa choices were fresh and neither too sedate nor too spicy, either for ourselves or our son.  I ordered the chimichanga arrachera, which was quite flavorful and, despite being large, not an \"unbeatable \" foe.  My wife's selection was the fajitas arrachera, which she simply described as \"delicious\".  The flank steak was a hair tough on both accounts, but could have been far worse from our experience.  Of course, it was happy hour.  House margaritas are discounted, and were quite... shall we say... effective.  Without being overly \"tequila-ey\", shall we say.  All this as we enjoyed a sunset dropping down over the valley, as the outdoor seating faces west.  On our next trip to the Valley of the Sun, we will be quite likely to pay this restaurant a visit."}
{"text":"Wow! I've never done a 1 star before but just to post on my recent almost dining experience with this restaurant. Came in at 6:43 and two people were in line ahead of us and we were told there was a 5 minute wait. As we are waiting another large group comes in and is immediately seated. No acknowledgement of our group waiting to be seated. I'm not sure if it's a management problem or extremely badly trained servers. We decided to leave and not give our business to such an establishment. Incredibly disappointing."}
{"text":"Mediocre food.  Awful service with a snarky attitude."}
{"text":"Wife and I checked this place out over the last weekend of June 2014.  Wife wanted Mexican and I could care less.  Walked in around 11am and no one really greeted us so we just sat at the bar.  The first bartender seemed nice and asked us what we were having for drinks.  Wife ordered a margarita and I ordered a bud light draft.  The margarita was done in about 20 seconds.  I asked my wife how it was and I could tell she didn't care for it.  We then ordered.  I got a gringo burger.  How racist of a name for a burger.  She ordered the nachos with meat.  It took about 15 minutes or so for the food to come out and we had chips while waiting.  Once the food came out a guy sat down at the bar a few seats down from us.  At this point I could tell my wife didn't care for her margarita and I asked another bartender (the other one just wandered off after getting is our initial drinks, never saw him again) if he could remake her margarita with patron.  He did and it was much better.  What was very strange was he have the guy my wife's old margarita who was sitting next to us??? Wtf right!  We both looked at each other and just hoped the guy new the bartender lol.  As for the food, it was delicious.  The nachos were freeking great!  My burger was also amazing.  The food was well worth it.  Hard to give any additional stats based on the bartender and the slightly off experience.  Food excellent, customer service so-so."}
{"text":"Papi Chulos is one of my favourite places,  Everything is just wonderful - food, service, ambiance. The Guacamole, Street Tacos and Arrachera Steak are to die for.  The ceviche was the best I've ever had.  The food was served in a timely manner, and was delicious.  I have been to many Mexican restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale area, but none quit as good as Papi Chulo's  Daniel is a great waiter (friendly,attentive and knowledgeable) and so are the other waiters too, everyone is so great and we love coming back time after time."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, margaritas were tasty. I would highly recommend papi chulo for a relaxing dinner. Ceviche was as good as its gets. Chimichanga with Carne asada was full of meat."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food... I ordered the flank steak combo came with rice an beans with a bean sauce very delicious. I also tried there shrimp which was even better, I was very impressed plus service is good!"}
{"text":"The nachos were top notch. I'll be back so I can try more items on the menu. Really liked the vibe and atmosphere at the place, and the prices seemed reasonable. And they provide you with complementary chips and salsa when you're seated. Friendly staff as well, at least those that I interacted with. The breakfast menu actually looked pretty good too. Like I said, I'll be back."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!! My wife asked if I would stop by this restaurant on my way home from work and pick up some dinned.  She would order the food, pay for it with her CC and I would just swing by and pick it up as we had done on several previous occasions.  When I arrived I ordered a beer and asked if I could put it in the to go order I was there to get.  \"No problem\" I was told.  15 minutes later the bartender said he had no to go orders.  I called my wife and she said the restaurants phone must be down as she had not been able to get through at all. When I brought this to the attention of the bartender, his response was \"we're just too busy to answer the phone.\"  At that point I just placed the order my self.  My wife gave me her CC # over the phone and asked the bartender to just process it this way.  He told me \"how do I know this is your wife's card?\" My response was \"well if she had been able to call the order in it wouldn't have been a problem, but your too busy to answer the phone!\"  He retorted with \"show me an ID with the same last name!\" I responded with \"my wife didn't take my last name.\" \"And the plot thickens\" was his reply. So I finally said \"If this is the way you treat your customers, I don't want your shitty overpriced caned food.  By the way the so called comedy you run out of this place should on no way be called comedy.  What a DICK!"}
{"text":"Ok in the morning when you want some of your breakfast but at night for dinner when you want service except a manager who does shots at another bar who doesn't manage too well when he is on duity"}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant twice while I was staying at the Days Hotel in Scottsdale. I was very pleased with the service and with the food. The only thing was that both times, the chips were stale. Other than that, I would go back again."}
{"text":"Empty for lunch. Had a Sonoran burrito, good but the relano sauce was missing. Terrific Cadillac margarita  Good service"}
{"text":"This experience is almost too funny to believe. So I walk in to a nearly empty bar. I go to take a seat at the bar and the actually bar is dirty. I grab a cocktail napkin to wipe it up. The bartender does not get a rag to wipe it up he says oh did the other person make a mess? Then I order a beer and some chips and salsa. He uses the dirty cocktail napkin I used to clean up bar to place under my drink. He brings the chips and salsa no napkin nothing. He leaves and goes who knows where.  I wait and eventually take a rolled silverware off a nearby table. He doesn't come back until after I finish and then sets a rolled silverware in front of me and asks if I want a water. He then gets a phone call and leaves. Literally leaves the total bar for nearly 15 min to chat on the phone. I could see him leaning against a window in the restaurant. Hilarious. This really happened. No wonder there were only 10 people in the whole place. Skip it."}
{"text":"We brought Out-of-towners from the midwest here for a night of comedy and dinner at Papi Chulo's Mexican Grill. One friend had Shredded Pork Taco dinner, another had the Tortilla Soup  which was delicious; still another friend had a chicken wrap with fries.  The service was attentive friendly and fast.  Very good food!!"}
{"text":"This place was not good. Not terrible, but not up to my standards. The enchilada sauce is strangely sour tasting. The service was alright, although the hostesses were absorbed in their own conversations. In AZ there is no reason to go to an 'alright' Mexican food place, there are too many terrific places close by."}
{"text":"I planned a birthday dinner for my wife and had a total of 11 family members there.  Only positive on this review is the food and drinks were good.  However the service was the worst I have ever experienced.  I thought we were on a reality show or something.  We had chips and drinks and the waiter asked if anyone else was  coming and I said yes 2 more but they are half hour away.  He said okay and left.  We did not see him again for 20 minutes   my sister in law accidently spilled her margarita that was full.  My mother in law had to get up and ask for a towel to clean the mess on table.  After that still no one came by to check on us.  My wife got up and found the waiter and told him what happened.  He reluctantly offered to get another one, and brought it in a small glass, not a margarita glass, and he left the first one with dirty margarita on the table.  At this time my wife got up and asked someone for the manager to come over.  He did and she explained what happened, and then the waiter comes over and starts arguing his case in front of everyone.  He says I told him we had 2 more people arriving in 30 mins so that's why he never came by.  After a few more back and forths the manager said don't worry we will take care of this.  Waiter took our order, food came, and after he dropped last  plate on table he left.  Didn't come check to see if we needed anything or how the food was....nothing.  my daughter noticed all water cups were empty so she got up to find someone to fill our cups.  Busboy came and did that.  He looked like he was 14 years old.  Waiter came by and asked if we wanted dessert and we said no, just 3 boxes.  He dropped them off and disappeared again for 15-20 mins.  My wife flagged him down again and asked for the check.  Meanwhile the same 14 year old looking busboy came and picked up everyone's plates and accidently hit my wife in the face with a napkin that was on the plate.  It didn't hurt her but he looked at her and didn't say a word.  It's possible that he didn't speak English because he never spoke but still apologize in your own language is better than nothing.  We spent over 150 dollars that night, but that shouldn't matter.  Wife and I have gone out and had water to drink and share a meal and spend 12 dollars and tip 5 because the service would be amazing, even though they know the tab is cheap.  This is my first time writing a review but I felt it necessary because the service was that bad , and in my opinion Derrick the manager did not represent your restaurant good at all."}
{"text":"The chimichanga and the cucumber margarita were pretty good. I'd go back if I lived in the area. One night, I saw they had a comedian in there, too. The service was okay and very polite. They also have a contest to eat the biggest burrito I've ever seen. It looks pretty impossible, though."}
{"text":"Came here for my moms 50.  Drinks: ordered the papa chulo margarita that had resporado tequila, it was good but not as strong. The waiter was great in adding in another shot! The mojito was also good.  The food was not great for most of the table. For myself, the vegetarian fajita was great! I really wish they had yellow corn tortilla. My sister ordered the chile relleno and a vegetarian enchilada and absolutely hated the taste, since the sauce was cold and rice lacked flavor. My husbands ordered was messed up by the person delivering the food. (Not our main waiter) who nicely and promptly fixed the ordered. The chicken fajita were ok, brother thought it lacked flavor and the cheese enchiladas were just overly stuffed with cheese.   Overall, the only reason I would go is the chips and salsa were good and the waiter was very very accommodating and prompt! Wish I knew his name! Otherwise this place needs to pick up their food quality and service for the people delivering the food!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. We had a family reunion at an adjacent hotel and thought we'd give this place a try. We called prior to arriving, notifying the establishment that we would have a large party. We were told that this wouldn't be a problem. When we arrived, we were treated poorly by the staff, told that we could not hover around the bar because it would \"look bad for business\" (we were a large party waiting to be seated!). Then one of the staff asked my aunt for her credit card prior to ordering food, presumably because they thought we would leave without paying...really? Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I have seriously been here over 10 times, and it is always declicious.  The arrachera is the best I've ever had.  In my opinion, good salsa makes a Mexican restaurant and this place does not disappoint.  Give it a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly service. My fiance had the #2 and I had the fish Tacos. Food was great and it was nice to get away from the hipsters that infest old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good food; we had no complaints. The margaritas were very good as well. I had the chicken taco salad with a side of retried beans. It was very good and the largest I've ever been served, I couldn't eat it all, but I tried! The guys both had enchiladas, and both said they were very good, but couldn't finish ( which is saying a lot!). This is the second time we've been here, and seems to be reliably good food and service."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Not that it was bad, but I could have made this food.  No real WOW factor, and given the neighborhood, they really need one to survive long term.  The place just came off as mediocre."}
{"text":"Food was good. Comedy club was excellent  but bar servers were very rude. They were closing at 11:15 and didn't even mention it and grabbed my beer and dumped it without saying a word. When I said something they didn't even apologize. Lots of places to choose from so won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is amazing enchiladas are great however service is slow slow slow. Been there couple times during lunch and they can't ever provide excellent or even good service."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food. Reasonably priced for the Scottsdale area. Been here 3 times now and was impressed every time I went. The servers we had were all on top of there game. Went in with my 2 year old both times and he came out a happy camper as well. I would highly recommend the tortilla soup to any soup fanatic."}
{"text":"We have eaten here numerous times over the past year.  Always enjoyed it.  The food has been excellent.  Great service.  Until recently.  There has been a change in the wait staff.  No one knows what they are doing.  Chris is the only one with a clue. Always great service from him in the past, but he is seldom on the floor when we arrive now. The quality of the food has slipped, for sure.  The bartender, nor the manager have ever so much as said \"hello\"....\"how is your  meal\"....\"can I get you anything\"?. From someone that has been in the hospitality business, I can tell you, a manager should be 'touching tables'....not, avoiding eye contact and ignoring the customers. He should be replaced. On our last visit...we had to ask for another beer...ask for the check...ask for the check to be picked up...etc.  No one spoke to us or said 'thank you' as we got up to leave. And they weren't even that busy.  Come on!!!!  You can do better. Sorry...but our tip reflected the shoddy meal and service."}
{"text":"This place is ok if you have low standards for food quality.  Drinks were just so- so and but cost full price.  The fish tacos came on flour tortillas instead of corn and tasted like thousand island dressing.  The rice and bean looked like they just opened a box of rice-a-roni.  Seriously low quality ingredients dressed up to be fine food.  This place lacked enthusiasm like corporate chains often do, but not always.  I was disappointed.  The decor was nice though. Go somewhere else if you want a good meal."}
{"text":"Great food, ambiance and service... I hear they have a great breakfast.I'm giving 4 stars cause I was refused breakfast cause I was 15 min late. Oh well I will be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Beware of the person taking the reservations. She's an incompetent/arrogant/ little one. To make a long story short she got lost with 5 reservations. Clearly that is not the  job for her, and I wouldn't say nothing if she didn't become arrogant with me, when I explained my reasons. As soon I arrived and giving my name, she told me that I had to wait for at least 30 min. I told her ok, no problem. And what she does after 5 min? She calls my name, and also tells me that she went outside looking for me. Clearly a lie because she never came outside looking for me, if not I'd have seen her. When I told her that I wanted to speak with the manager about that, really she got her best of bad manners telling me that he was busy and i couldn't talk to him. She answered so fast to that request that I can just imagine how many times she used that excuse. Of course my wife and I left, and on our way out a very nice waiter (Travis), that understood the situation and nicely tried to invite me back in offering us a free dinner because of what happened. i just told him that it was not about the money it was about that treatment we received from that one. But at least he tried, thing that we appreciate very much. So be careful there, and please control your reservation, because she's incapable of doing her job. Alberto."}
{"text":"fun spot, pretty good food-not crazy authentic but definitely still worthy of a meal or two here-and the service was good.  Very casual laid back but I loved the tortilla soup :) Don't come in looking to be wow'd by the service but they did fine in my book, it's so casual so I don't understand why everyone was so eerked about the service."}
{"text":"I find it hard to take the time to write an adequate review about places that bore me so this is all I have: It's not a bad Mexican place; there's simply nothing special about it. I had a variety of tacos and my date had a burrito. Our entrees were very average at above average prices."}
{"text":"The management/cooks must have changed because this place went from being ok for lunch to horrible! I thought maybe it was a fluke and ate there again but it was worse.  I do not recommend this place! It is very expensive, save your money and head down to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everytime I come to Scottsdale, I have to visit, a couple of times too  No matter what I try, I'm never disappointed, never!  Last night I had the chimichanga (sp?) and it was delicious!  I felt it could have been shared but it made for a great lunch today."}
{"text":"Big Mistake. In Phoenix looking for a quick meal. Decided to eat at the bar and service was about as slow as I have experienced in a long time. I don;t blame the bartender, she was the only one I saw lifting a finger while everyone else stood around.  Food came before chips and  Iprobably should have filled up on the chips first.  This was not much better than fast food and lacked anything that would make me want to come back again.   Some event was going on in the room near the bar and the guy running it was loud and complaining that the night was going to suck.  I don't want to hear about business issues while I am just trying to have a quick dinner and catch a little sports.   There are many better places in the Scottdale area, don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here with my daughter. Complementary salsa and chips were interesting, 3 salsa choices, verde between a mild and smoky hot. the verde was almost hotter than the 'hot' so I liked them fine. Great tortilla soup with lots of shredded meat, cotija and a big slice of avocado. Nice meaty taste and a good size portion. Street tacos with signature marinated beef and nopales were superb. Only complaint was that they STILL seem to be getting the service down. Liked the decor a lot, but you have to get the napkins and silver down once the food arrives. And your sign about lunch specials? You should know what they are before you start your shift. Especially when the sign is wrong and there really aren't any specials! The actual service was fine. As this is a local establishment, I'm looking forward to returning. Maybe when there really are specials!"}
{"text":"Purchased a $20 Groupon for $10 to use during breakfast or lunch. I regretted not going for breakfast since this was the 2nd time returning for lunch. This time I indulged in Combo #4. For about $11 you get 1 very salty cheese enchilada smothered in red sauce & 1 cheese and spinach stuffed chile relleno fried in a light batter and showered with a white sauce. That's both complimented with ordinary Spanish rice and bland beans. Thank goodness I already filled up on their complimentary firm tortilla chips (which I very much enjoy) and savorless salsa. I remorsefully strayed away from the shrimp fajita's (which is what I enjoyed the last time & left with a smile on my face) because I thought $18 was a bit too steep. I'm sure we'll be back since my other half enjoyed his meat filled burro. But maybe I could talk him in to take-out instead?  Service was friendly and observant (ensured our drinks were full & empty plates taken away). Place was deserted for a Sunday afternoon but that could be due to football being on. Which they did feature on one of four flat screens."}
{"text":"What a complete nightmare. I booked a reservation for a family gathering. Upon arrival, they refused to sit my party together. The general manager, John A., refused to rectify the situation in any way. The only thing general about this manager was that he was 'generally' useless. Completely disaster. Avoid larger group reservations at all costs."}
{"text":"We liked the chips and salsa, the mojito, the shrimp mojo and the deep fried ice cream. The service was good as well. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Greatest bar ever with the greatest people ever.  I was coming here 4 nights a week and am sad to be moving away tomorrow.  I really can't say enough good things about this place, everything is exceptional.  It's a real shame to read some of the poor reviews below, and as someone who made Papi's his second home, I've only seen the best so far.  Wish you guys nothing but the best in 2014, and I'll be back in a few months!"}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago & again recently. The service & food were fantastic. I love that they have a great selection of mild dishes without sauces (cause I hate them). Chips & salsa were definitely made fresh with perfect blend of spices.   Great southwestern decor' that's rustic but totally fits the Mexican theme of the restaurant.  I will definitely keep going back when I'm in the area. And you should too!"}
{"text":"Food was bomb but the server was a hot mess. He seemed like he didn't know what he was doing and messed up our drink orders. The food made up for it!!"}
{"text":"My husband I had a delicious flank steak Burrito & a stiff Margarita!! Service was great! After dinner we went to Stand Up Scottsdale Comedy club! The comedy club is attached to the restaurant very convenient. Had a wonderful experience there as well! Great for date night!!"}
{"text":"The food- so-so at best. The margaritas- blah. The service was decent, and the restaurant itself is quite large, but nothing stood out as great. My favorite thing about this place, is the name. Unfortunately there are no actual papi-chulos in this place."}
{"text":"I am changing my last review. We came in tonight was told that the system is down and they are not sitting anyone until it is up. But a party of 6 just came in after we were waiting for 30 mins. The manager went ahead and seated them. Asked hostess why they got seated and said manager said it was ok for them but not for us. Asked if we could just sit and have soda, chips and salsa. Was told no. Have never been so disrespected. They do not even deserve one star. Finally seated but they can not come back in my eyes. Chrs  our waiter was super nice. He tried so hard to try to make it up."}
{"text":"Ugh. Went because there was a coupon in the coupon mailer. Sat for 20 minutes and didn't even get our order taken in a near-empty restaurant. Won't be back."}
{"text":"It made me really nervous to see that this place is in the Days Hotel, my experiences with restaurants in hotels...well, its not been good.  I got even more leery when we walked in and the place was empty.  That's usually not a good sign either.  Happily, my fears turned out to be unfounded.  We had a pretty good dinner.  We started with guacamole.  It was actually fresh, nicely presented (not in a bowl filled halfway with lettuce) and although it needed more salt and lime juice, it was pretty darn good.  I'm comfortable calling it the best I've had out here.  Guacamole is one of those things I'm picky about and I get really irritable when folks try to pass off their green mayo as guacamole.  This was real avocado, nice and chunky, with tomatoes mixed in.  Delicious! We both tried the street tacos and they were pretty good too.  They weren't the best I've had, but I won't complain.  The waitress brought me extra limes and kept the iced tea glasses filled.  The tab was about $40.  Not too bad for good food in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"brought fresh salsa and chips as soon as I sat down and they have a great selection of specialty margaritas."}
{"text":"I thought the staff was super nice, friendly and attentive.  I really enjoyed the chips and the three salsas that come to the table when you sit down from mild to hot.    I was not impressed with the food.  I ordered steak fajitas and my friend a burrito. We were both not very happy with the food.  I think they used steakums for the fajitas and my friend just said her burritos were ehhh."}
{"text":"After a long walk in a hot day in Scottdales,I decided not to go to far from my hotel so my friend and I chose Papi Chulo for dinner.From the outside it looked like an average Mexican restaurant,but when I walked in the restaurant,it was casual and cleaned restaurant with quite a.nice decor.I ordered Nachos,Margarita and Mazatlan Shrimp.I did not order my main course since the server suggested that it would be too much for me.The Nachos was quite yummy.The melted cheese and sour cream were such a good combination and the salsas was great(they served 3 kinds of salsas here).My Mazatlan Shrimp(Shrimp stuffed with Cheese wrapped with bacon and Fried and served with Rice)were surprisingly delicious.This restaurant offers variety of Margaritas if you love to drink , this restaurant is perfectly suits you.The waiter who waited on our table was very friendly.However,the restaurant should play more Mexican music than American ones. My friend and I like  Papa Chulo so much that we went back there again two days later.This time I ordered Shrimp Al Mojo and my friend ordered Chimi.   Do not pay attention to the negative reviews here,this restaurant is still worthed to try. To me it is a nice cozy restaurant that serves delicious food, food presentation makes the food here are appealing and enticing.Slow but good and friendly service.I will come back here again if I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Tortilla soup and the golden tacos (tacos dorados) are really good. We had lunch here and the food and service were really good. From the moment you walk in you feel the good vibes. Also, the chips and salsa are delicious and food is authentic Mexican I just wished they had the Mexican soft drinks like horchata."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were very nice. Had the bartender make an avocado margarita that I once had at a 5 star resort in Mexico and it was just as good if not better."}
{"text":"Are lunch had fish tacos, enchiladas and rellenos with margaritas.  Food was ok drinks were not the best though lots of tequila and not other taste."}
{"text":"We planned to have a birthday dinner for my parents at Papi Chulo's because it is one of their favorite restaurants. We were able to get the back room for our large party and they even brought in an extra small table for gifts and the cake. The manager John was extremely helpful throughout the planning. Our main server Alex was attentive, friendly, and efficient. All of the guests loved their food (with a medium/large party size we were able to order off the regular menu and didn't require a set menu as with some restaurants) even the kids loved their meals. Of course we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Got a living social deal. 1st time going to Papi. Its very quiet inside. Patio is small. and right near Scottsdale Rd. Probably wont go back. Food was ok (street tacos). Portion was generous. Salsas pretty good but hot. Good service and nice server."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was so happy with my visit!  We noticed the huge piñata on the roof.  Walking in was a nice casual atmosphere with lots of natural lightening.  Being a vegetarian I was nervous I wouldn't have many options.  TOTALLY WRONG!  They have vegetarian beans that contain no lard! Yay!  They offered to make spinach con queso enchiladas but I went for a taco salad.  The house dressing was so delicious, and I admit to being picky about my dressings.  I had them put avocados instead of meat. The avocados were perfectly fresh, not brown and gross like many others Ive had while dining out! The server sold us on coming back this weekend for there two day Cinco De Mayo party.   Only suggestion would be to have the veggie options marked on the menu as it is a large menu with lots of options.  Looking forward to trying the spinach queso enchiladas and margarita this weekend!"}
{"text":"The Pollo Fresco was awesome!  The white sauce over the chicken breast complemented the rice with fajita veggies very well... the veggies had pineapple in it for a nice twist to the normal grilled variety.  The chips came with a hot fire roasted salsa and a medium salsa both with great flavor. The Margs were weak but he server assured me it was because they were training a new bartender and to come back on a happy hour or weekend and I would luv it. Goupon is a good deal."}
{"text":"We order from this place a couple times per month. I'm not sure why we keep going back. Our order is wrong EVERY SINGLE TIME! Tonight will be our last time!"}
{"text":"This Place was dead when I got there for lunch but I must say that the taco salad with shredded beef and single malt of whiskey that I had, not only was it  delish but the price was right!. Rey, the bartender was friendly. I wish that I would have had the chance to go back on the weekend when it was suppose to be a mad house but maybe next time, if I find myself in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"always like this place. Decor here is very nice, with flat TVs all over the bar and restaurant for sports. Staff is always friendly and the food is above average. They bring out 2 different salsas with chips automatically. The salsa is fresh and has a unique flavor."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from someone in the airport. I was not disappointed was very good and so were the margaritas. I always judge a Mexican spot by how good there rice and beans are and papi chulo's beans were on point. Will come here again on our next visit"}
{"text":"Weird location but never crowded and service is generally above par. A 7 year old once sat me with more professionalism than most 18 year olds. Chips, salsa, bbq sandwich? tacos, burritos."}
{"text":"SO I AM HERE BEEN HERE OVER  30 MINS  THE WAITRESS HAS WALK PAST ME 5TO 7 TIMES NEVER AS IF I LIKE A DRINK OR  FOOD  maybe it my skin color because a Caucasian couple sitting  accross from me  got drinks and food  and I am the only person of color in the room. Not setting a friendly  environment ."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place but put it off due to some of the reviews . Well, I was dieing for chicken tacos and happened to drive by , so I stopped. And so glad I did! The service was excellent and the chips and homemade salsa... Best I've had in Phoenix . I started to get excited for my chicken taco lunch ! And it was amazing, authentic, delicious and everything homemade. The beans, oh my goodness , so delicious as was the Mexican rice. I noticed they have cheese stuffed jumbo shrimp wrapped in bacon on the menu. I'll be back later in the week to try those baby's. Give this place a shot! I'm so glad I did !!!!!"}
{"text":"The slowest, most unorganized group of people. Took forever to get anything delivered to the table and refills on water and coffee just doesn't happen. Food is ok service is the worst!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place to eat very clean good hostesses. Great drinks food is excellent when I return to Scottsdale this will be my eating place"}
{"text":"One of the most annoying bartender's ever. Website says $2 drafts for HH. I mention this to clueless bartender who starts making faces like he had a bad burrito for lunch. He wants me to show it to him on my phone, I refuse and we go back and forth for several minutes before he agrees to give me a Bud light for fore-mentioned two bucks. Winner me, loser Papi Chulo's and their empty restaurant at dinner time. Thinking about going back and showing Mr. Clueless the website tomorrow or pasting a copy on the front door. Overpriced food as well."}
{"text":"We went to Papi Chulo's for dinner and had a nice experience. The food, atmosphere, and drinks were all really good. The waitress and bartender were both friendly and helpful. One of the things that makes a good Mexican restaurant is that it MUST have great chips and salsa, and Papi Chulo's passes the test."}
{"text":"Awesome place! I come here all the time. Some of the best rellenos in town. I always get salad instead of rice and beans and the cilantro dressing is to die for. Rice and beans are good too, I just try to eat lower carb. I also enjoy the huevos rancheros Christmas style and the sizzling enchiladas, which are served on top of fajita vegetables with guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gallo. Most of their portions are big enough to share. They also have a decent selection of draft beers and high-end  tequila. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had great food and would have been 5 stars if not for a few service hiccups. All the tables had two place settings apiece and the server did not bring over a third place setting for our party when we were seated. He also gave us only two menus. Come on, now, the place was between the Sat lunch and dinner period and we were the only table occupied for the first ten minutes we were there. Food is excellent. Great tortilla soup and chicken mole. Rice, beans, veggies, all very tasty with generous portions. Guac great and tortillas, too. This place hits it out of the park with food quality, just need to tweak service a little."}
{"text":"I went with a group of coworkers after a long training nearby.  I've been here before but I don't remember my experience with it.  Your first impression of this place is that it's nice with it's decor.  I ordered water since I was with a boss.  The water tastes like fish swam in it. Yuck. I reordered a Coke.  $2.50!  When that came out, that tasted like stale, bitter and really flat Coke.  We told the lady and she later brought us another soda, which tasted better but still bitter.  (Clean your machine!!!)  I ordered a #2 lunch combo which was one cheese enchilada and two shredded beef taquitos served with rice and beans.  My coworker ordered a #1 but had them make her enchilada a chicken. She seemed to like hers much better than I did mine.  My enchilada tasted like they just wrapped two mozzarella sticks with a corn tortilla and the taquitos were absolutely tasteless.  The best part of the dish was the rice and beans. Yuck.   I wish that we had gone somewhere else, but we figured since it was a couple doors down from the hotel it would be easier for all of us.  :/"}
{"text":"Great spot. I didn't know it was there for the longest time and now I keep going back. Everything I've tried has been great."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon for this place.  The food was just ok.  We ordered a bean and cheese burrito lunch plate, and a shredded beef burrito lunch plate.  It took a long time for the food to come out, and when it did, the inside was lukewarm.  It was not hot at all.  Our waitress seemed new, or just knew very little about the place.  It's a shame the food wasn't better as our office is very close and this would have been a convenient lunch place."}
{"text":"Food, service and chips and salsa were all great. We had a chicken chimichanga and a beef chimichanga. They were loaded with more meat than we had ever experienced. Came with rice, beans, guacamole and sour cream. Atmosphere is casual and comfortable. We will be back."}
{"text":"* 2.5 Stars Freshly prepared food? Can't be!  I usually never complain that my food comes out too quick, but everything thing we ordered came out 5 minutes from when we ordered it.... Which means it was basically reheated. Mine definitely tasted that way.     Let's start off with the chips and salsa... just okay, the seasoning on the chips was pretty tasty, the hot salsa had good flavor and the mild salsa was flavorless.  We started off with the guacamole, nothing special... probably \"Wholly\" doctored up with some onions.    To drink, I had their \"Perfect Rita\" it was good, but $7 Happy hour price... nothing I couldn't have somewhere else for less than 5 bucks.   For dinner, I ordered the cheese enchiladas.  I wanted the veggie enchiladas but when I asked what veggies where in it the server told me \"probably the same as the fajitas, peppers and onions\".  That didn't sound too exciting so I just went with cheese. The sauce was watered down and definitively from a can...Yuck!  I scrapped it off, mixed up the hot salsa and sour cream and made my own sauce, so it was at least edible.  I don't think it was heated up enough either, because my cheese was rubbery.   To top it off my Bf ordered a carne platter and the veggies were not peppers and onions, they were zucchini, squash and carrots... exactly what I would have wanted in my enchiladas!    Overall, my BF won't let me give it two stars.  He enjoyed his food, mine was okay, we had good service and the atmosphere was inviting.  Although,  I highly doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"We aren't from here,   Visiting from Ohio and we found this restaurant on google search,  and now I'm not even sure where to start!   The food is easily the best and freshest Mexican food I have ever had,  and the waiter was so very sweet,  polite and kind and attentive.   I now have a new favorite.  One thing is certain after eating here.   People in Ohio don't know how to do Mexican Food."}
{"text":"I Like the street tacos at this place.  Overall its just your average Mexican restaurant.  Papi's not in my neighborhood so I probably won't be going back.  There are plenty of places on my list that I'm willing to take a trek to eat at once and a while (this place won't be one of them).  Try Frank and Lupes Old Mexico.  Its close by, and the food is much better (and more reasonably priced)."}
{"text":"I'm kinda in love with this place. The salsa is delicious, as in has flavor and texture. The chips are good, not to salty, not too thin, not too thick.   The food itself was a good quality. Fresh tasting and flavorful. Don't get me wrong, I love me some greasy hole in the wall Mexican joints but sometimes, like when it's over 90 degrees..I don't. I want fresh.  I don't ferment the name of the dish I ordered, but it was grilled chicken with pineapple salsa and grilled veggies. Best veggies I've ever eaten at a restaurant. The flavor all married really well. The veggies had an almost chipotle red sauce and the fresh light citrusy flavor on the chicken were a great team. My only complaint was the side of tortillas I ordered extra were a bit dried it.   I ordered a margarita, again not remembering its name, but it was the melon one. Very good. Not too sweet and not too boozy tasting for lunchtime.   I like the restaurant itself. We sat inside but they had the doors open so we got a light breeze. Casual, nice, and enjoyable.   I'm a little bummed we didn't know about comedy night earlier as I didn't think I could eat Mexican 2 meals consecutively, but next time we will give that a try."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch with coworkers.  It is pretty good mexican food with great prices and excellent margarita specials.  If you join foursquare and check in there you get $0.99 margarita's, for regular folks i think it is $1.99."}
{"text":"Even with 3 stars we decided to give this place a try, big mistake. Food was mediocre at best, the $12 margarita was good but not so as to save this visit. Restaurant is actually nice, but they should consider revamping the menu or get someone running the kitchen that can actually prepare a decent dish. My advice look elsewhere to have a good Mexican dinner."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food, friendly service.  Chicken tacos were good, decent rice and beans.  Chips and salsa were good."}
{"text":"I remember when Ro and I ate at this restaurant on the day it first opened years and years ago. We were the 4th table to occupy this place. While our food was being made, the manager gave us coupons for free margaritas on our return visit. I never returned to the restaurant until this past Saturday.   I purchased a special on Living Social and realized we had to use it before Dec. 12th. So we trekked down and enjoyed a great meal. Loved the Chicken Quesadilla! Adam, our waiter, was great as well. I'm certain we'll be back to this place. Cheers***"}
{"text":"No.   Just no.    Chips taste like old oil.   Margarita might as well have been a lime flavored water.   There was a ROCK in my beans.   Yes, I know that sometimes happens when you cook beans but that is also why you wash and sort them first.   Save yourself.   Pick a different place."}
{"text":"This is a nice Three Star, Mexican themed watering hole.   Many of my SoCal/LA friends might know Antonio's on Melrose. It's the only other Mexican restaurant I know that has a tee shirt concession stand inside the restaurant. LOL.   But the similarities end there, since Antonio's is an LA institution, long before being featured on Entourage btw.   Here it's just simple Americanized Mexican food, with large goblets of Margaritas, much along the lines of a ChiChi's or El Torito's. We came in after passing it many times and enjoyed ourselves.   Expect to pay around $25 each, including drinks, taxes and gratuities. It may not be a gourmet place, but this gourmand enjoyed it.    So Three Stars, \"A-Okay\"."}
{"text":"This place is a joke.  The receipt conveniently suggests gratuity but instead of telling you the percent of gratuity it says \"Good Service... Great Service... Stellar Service...\"  When I did the math they were suggesting 19%, 22%, 24%, but unless people do the math you'd just assume you were choosing between 15%, 18% and 20%. I typically tip well (ive been a server and know how it is) but this is a sneaky way to trick customers into tipping 24% and it pisses me off.  Our server gave us our checks before we even received our food.  He was nice but was running back and forth doing one thing at a time rather than asking the entire table if we needed refills, etc.  As we were finishing up our meals we saw our server take off, so all that running around was just him trying to be done with his shift.  Food was good but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Used a Living Social coupon for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon and loved everything about this place! Our server was personable and attentive, the food was fresh and very tasty and the prices were very reasonable. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Came for a comedy show at Papi chulos with Andrew Kennedy! Great prices on food and the best salsa fire roasted; really funny shows and njce staff!"}
{"text":"Went there on a groupon for dinner and the comedy show.  The food was respectable but nothing great.  Think your basic Mexican joint with the standard burrito/taco/chimichangas.  Service was good even thought the server looked like she was going to be overbooked in the comedy room she did a great job of handling everyone.  The comedy itself was pretty bland but that's a different review."}
{"text":"I have never given a one-star review on Yelp before.  Honestly, this was the WORST experience I have ever had in a restaurant in my entire life.  If I told you the whole story, you wouldn't believe it anyway.  Let's just say that the story included two patrons who were served so much alcohol that one of them passed out cold while sitting in his bar stool.  That's just the beginning.  The story involves a good Samaritan, the fire department, an ambulance, two police officers, a belligerent drunk (the one who didn't fall out of his chair) and a \"manager\" who was pretending like none of this was actually happening.  The two meals that we ordered were half-eaten because my wife and I had to intervene on behalf of the half-dead drunk zombie who was dragged across the restaurant by his armpits by an employee and then sequestered in a secluded room - where the manager never once checked on his unconscious patron's welfare.  Then, after the police left, the firemen left, and the ambulance pulled away with the drunk man strapped to a gurney, the manager, instead of thanking us for stepping up and taking control of a crazy and potentially life-threatening situation, just handed us the bill.  He did not say \"sorry,\" he did not say \"thank you,\" he did not say anything other than \"pay up.\"  Seriously................  The service here is perhaps the WORST ON THE PLANET.  The food (that is, what we ate of it) can only be described as purely mediocre.  If you are a masochist, and you want to see how bad life can get, then I wholly recommend that you visit this place often.  If you want to dodge a completely-avoidable disaster, turn your car around and go home.  This place is the worst of the worst."}
{"text":"Nothing bland here! Very clean and warm environment with great service! The food... Amazing... Not even a question of being the best Mexican food I have tasted... And I've been to many Mexican restaurants.  I have tried Chile Relleno at every place.... These were hands down the best I have found yet! Queso Chicken enchiladas were fantastic also!! We will definitely be returning to enjoy this establishment!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was pretty middle of the road good and  experience... I just wish they had some way to not make it so noisy there... booths would be great!"}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times and the past few have been highly disappointing. The food quality has declined significantly and they keep putting chicken in my vegetarian dishes. One time I didn't see it and took a bite. It was so disgusting.  They do have good margaritas, so if you only want to drink, then this is a good option. I would avoid the extra greasy, unappetizing food though."}
{"text":"Staying at the double tree by Hilton resort. This was a close walk so went to check it out with one other person. First time was great staff was friendly and quick. So we came back and told the rest of the group(15 people) how great it is and decided to go back all together the next day. Went back and the waiter was just confused. He brought one drink out at a time. And the food took about 45 minutes to come out and it wasn't at the same time. They would come out in 2 minute intervals and we were the only people in there.   Maybe they're just not good with big groups? Or they don't get big groups often."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this restaurant 0 stars. ZERO, because they give zero f***s about their customers. We only went here because we were staying nearby and it was the easiest and quickest solution on our time crunch. When we walked in, we were looked at constantly by all the employees, including the bartender, who was RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. He finally told us to have a seat, when we could see empty tables were available. The place isn't that big, and there were four servers. Enough to handle the amount of customers that were there, IF they knew how to prioritize. None of them did. I told the bartender we'd stand and wait for one of the empty tables. He wasn't too happy with me, as I said it it quite snarky and sternly. Finally, a waiter comes over and tells us it'll be about 15 minutes.  !!!!!!!!! SERIOUSLY? So, we sat and waited, staring everyone down, which didn't do any good. I finally stood again, glaring, and the bartender THEN tells me we can order at the bar. FINE! We just wanted to eat! Oh, well, then all of a sudden the table I wanted became available. Oh, and don't bother calling the place, the phone just rings and rings and rings.   The food is good, but not worth the frustration. Like I said, we were in a time crunch, and getting in the car to go somewhere else would have taken more time. Once they sat us, the service was better. But, geeeze! They don't seem to care about losing customers, as three parties left becauseoif the wait and how it was handled. They initially told us they were waiting for a big party to come in and they'd be taking up the tables - they closed in an hour and that \"big party\" never came in.  Nice try.  The bartender did take our drinks off the tab - a Pepsi and a. club soda - for our \"challenges\" we experienced. I still don't know why we were paying him, not a host or our waiter, and he needs to work on his people skills, as he doesn't have any.   I would not recommend this restaurant unless you're in no hurry and can deal with employees who look right through you."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Papi Chulo's yesterday and I must say I was impressed. I had the enchiladas with the green sauce and the sauce was delicious! I also liked the chips (warm) and salsas they gave us. I eat mostly mexican food and they have earned my business. The service was very good. We had a waiter and a gentleman, possibly the manager that was checking to make sure we were satisfied. It was during the lunch hour, and while they were busy, they managed to make sure we were satisfied with our experience. They gave us lunch club cards with 5 punches already in each one. So onyl two more lunches and we get a freebie. I may become a regular here... they also have a private room for networking and private lunches."}
{"text":"Meh. The Cesar chicken salad is the best thing I have had there. I have eaten here, not by choice, several times.  not terrible....but certainly not anything special.  If your in a pinch it's a good place for lunch.  have never been here for dinner.  staff always seems to be very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Went here last Friday night with the girls. We had quite a few drinks before and after The Naughty Show at the bar. This is based solely on drinks. The bartender studied all of our IDs quite intently. I hope he wasn't studying my address it got a bit awkward. After we passed the ID test he asked us for drinks. We asked what kind of beer do you have he answered \"we have sooo many\" hinting there was too many to say. Me and my sis asked for some Guinness he said \"no sorry we don't have that\" Ummmm Kiltlifter??? \"No we don't.\" Strike two!!! One of the girls asked for a Corona and the other a BL. Of course they got those beers. So I asked again \"What beer do you have so we can possibly decide on one before the night ends?\" Nothing great so we settled on Modelo Especial. Later after we got seated in the Comedy Club I ordered a Mojito and the rest of the girls ordered other mixed drinks. Their reviews of the drinks they got were not so great but the Mojitos were surprisingly good in a very tall glass!! Everyone started ordering them. I must of had like 10 that night until they closed the kitchen and they couldn't get any more mint. Yummm!"}
{"text":"Not sure WHY this place doesn't have ALL 5 stars. We recently visited the Phoenix area from California and let me just say this is the best [BEST] mexican prepared food I have ever tasted. I love mexican food and have been to countless mexican restaurants - every thing from the spices, presentation, ambiance, and service (with TJ) was totally awesome. We even got a chance to speak with the GM Brad who was very approachable. It was a very good experience. I highly recommend this place. Ask for TJ, he will treat you right. If we ever go back to Phoenix, we will certainly visit this place again.   Oh, also, they give you a lot of food - we had take out, refrigerated it at the hotel, and for the drive back microwaved it and it was just as good. I had the mixed fajitas, my hubby had the chicken enchiladas and our kids had the chicken quesadillas- good stuff!!"}
{"text":"Born and raised in AZ I eat lots of tex-mex and this place has good stuff.  Waiter staff is phenomenal and the atmosphere is nice. Poker on Mondays make it a must do!"}
{"text":"I was dissatisified upon picking up a to-go order to see that a 22 % gratuity had been added to it, it was an order of 10 and not only was I not informed while placing the order about the grat I was not even offered help to my car when picking it up.    I called it in the day before for an 11:30 AM (before the lunch rush) pick-up and yes, I DO tip on to-go orders.  To me 22 % is PERFECT service while I am seated in the establishment not added onto a pick up order I am picking up and hauling to my car without help (they did not even open the door)  I think if they wish to continue having business they might want to re-think their position on take out orders and what they add to them."}
{"text":"This place is great for a out of towner like myself, it is like Cheers there's no stranger's everyone is welcome to the family of fun....I think I have bben adopted....LOL. Don't forget to give the comedy club a try. The SpeakEasy is only a doorway away."}
{"text":"I won't be going here again.  I can honestly say that I didn't like anything about it.  Our server was somewhat friendly, but that's about it.  And there is a good amount of parking, given that the hotel is right there.    The bad:  1.  Server only brought one set of silverware for me and my friend, and took about 20 minutes to bring the second set.  2.  My Coke was very watery.  Found out that the syrup line wasn't working, so they went to replace it, and then came back and told me that they were out of Coca-Cola... like it's some rare thing for a restaurant to have.  3.  The spinach con queso was very runny and had very little flavor.  4.  The steak in the skirt steak taco was VERY dry and very salty.  5.  The sopapillas come out with some weird butterscotch-tasting flavor added to the honey.  When I asked the server what it was, she went back to ask the chef, and then returned to tell me, \"Yeah, it's something different, but we're not sure.  Maybe it's just a different kind of honey.\"  What?!?  One word:  Nope."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there's iffy reviews here. We have been here several times over the years. Latest was two nights ago with a group of 7. The food has always been delicious and the wait staff was helpful and attentive. The taquitos, fajitas, and sizzling enchiladas were all excellent. Chips and salsa were right up there with some of the best I've ever had. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was Great! Not shy on the portions; they are big. The bar rocks and looks very hip. The menu is well composed with traditional items, as well as some with a flair.   I had the taco salad and totally  enjoyed the cilantro lime dressing. The shell was very fresh and not overly greasy like many I've had.  Service was ample but nothing  to write home about... I would reccommend. #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"I looked at reviews before coming here, they were VERY mixed so I wanted to check it out myself.. I'm staying at the Chapperal Suites next door and ended up going for happy hour (Mon-Fri 3pm-6pm). I was surprised how good the happy hour food was and only $5! I also had a frozen strawberry margarita, AMAZING!! And did I mention only $5?!?!! We were the only ones in there when we first arrived. Chris our server was awesome, never a empty glass :)! There is a patio but it was wayyyyy too hot out (109) to be seated outside! They have a comedy club attached to restaurant but its only open Friday and Saturday.  This bar is fully stocked! I ordered a Tecate but sadly they don't sell it, a little bummed about that :( Ended up ordering a Corona light, was nice surprise to see it was $1.00 off! Usually only drafts are on happy hr. All and all I had a great experience and would definitely recommend checking this place out! I WILL be back!!!"}
{"text":"Chips & Salsa were the only things that were good. Margarita on the rocks was ok, spinach dip was ok. Chese enchilada & chile relleno was ok. Husband had a chicken chimi, he did not like it but like the beans and rice. My friend from Canada like the beef enchilada & hard shredded beef taco.  Flan was tough."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon, 1:30 party of 4.  many tables open as well as dirty.  The waitstaff did mention that they were short staff, so will find us a clean table.  Turned out only he was waiting tables, probably a cook and a bartender.  i think at one point there were 28 patrons.  it took forever to get drinks, chips, meals, and of course a couple of mishaps with drinks and food order.  I dont blame the staff, but blame management."}
{"text":"Papa Chulo's is right across the street from my work. We come here for their great happy hour and lunch specials. It is a good restaurant and the hh prices are fair. I would reccommend Papa Chulo's!"}
{"text":"we had a restaurant coupon and gave this place a try. i thought it was just a hotel eatery but it was pretty darn good. our server was attentive and kept our glasses full. i started off with a happy hour margarita that was heavy on the tequila (yay!) and salt (whew) but the latter is easy to fix.   for dinner, i had the shrimp fajitas which where extremely tasty and filling and my gal had the ahi tuna which was a bit dry. the \"free\" chips and salsa had to be taken away as we kept munching and stuffing ourselves. my only gripe is the standard rice and beans accomp. for the price of the entree's, i would've thought the run-of-the mill rice and beans served at the el cheapo establishments would've been replaced with a more authentic or flavorful touch.   well, whatever. we left happy and i accidentally left my doggy bag on the table and around lunch time today, wish i hadn't. it's a good place. very hot bartenders this night too....no worries as my gal lets me know when her male bartenders are just as smokin."}
{"text":"Standard Mexican fare, a little pricey but it's Scottsdale near several resorts. Went there for lunch since we were attending a training seminar nearby. Service was okay not outstanding. Better options in the area so I doubt I would make another trip."}
{"text":"Got there 5 minutes after happy hour ended, wouldn't even give us our first round of weak drinks at hh price. But that's just how the night started. We ended up ordering 3 different margaritas, $7 a piece, and left still feeling quite sober. The margs taste like store bought marg mix, no tequila no kick, just frozen lime water. Ok, move on to the uneventful food. We shared a Fiesta Platter. I didn't have a party in my mouth. The quesadilla was soggy and had tomato and onion in it, which was not really appetizing. The nachos seemed to be made with thick shredded mozzarella cheese, doesn't go well on top of mexican food. It seemed like the took a whole jar of black olives and just dumped them on top. The mini chimichangas are really good (best part of the whole experience), but the platter comes with 3 and they only sent 2. When I made them aware we thought they would send out 2 more just for the inconvenience, nope  just 1. The taqitos (spell check) were edible but not thrilling. At the end of the meal we ended up sending back the nachos, quesadillas, and half the taqitos.  Long  story short, we will not be back and we'll never recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"The service was friendly but abysmally slow. There were a lot of people working and for the size, the place was pretty empty, but they were generally disorganized. It took us over 2 hours total to have a 'quick' breakfast.  I had huevos rancheros and the tortilla was either old or overcooked, it was so hard. The beans were well flavored.  My friend had the biscuits and gravy and said they were good.  We were staying at the hotel behind the restaurant, so the location was incredibly convenient, but I wouldn't go to this restaurant again. There are too many other choices close by."}
{"text":"Their chips and salsa were quite good. The chips were served warm and they provided 3 types of salsas.  I had the tostadas and they provided 3 full sized tostadas which were simply the best I've ever had in a restaurant.  My wife had a Vege Chimi which she loved.  It was light and crispy with a good mix of veges in it.  My daughter had the fish taco and beans which she enjoyed, although she didn't care for the dressing (1000 Island?) that came in it.  We finished the meal with some Sopapillas, which were wonderful as well.  The service was warm, friendly and timely.  It's a pretty casual/comfortable place to go and we'll absolutely be back at Papi Chulo's the next time we're in Scottsdale.  Not sure what's up with some of the negative reviews, but our experience was excellent all around and the food was very reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Great groupon deal 20$ for 40$ credit here. The skinny  After a nice walk around the mall me and my girl decided on Mexican food for lunch we quickly searched groupon for any deals and found papi chulos less than a mile away with a great deal. We got there the waitress super friendly sat us right away and a young gentleman served us chips and salsa and we had out drinks even before I could open menu what great service. We decided on our meals my girl the shrimp fajitas (16$) and me the arrachera (flank steak 15$) my girl was in love as she loves her veggies and she thought the shrimp was cooked just right. My plate was also great the steak was soft and cut just like butter and the marinate sauce was so good. We def got out money's worth I just wasn't to crazy about rice and beans.  The bad  Sticky tables and sticky menus clean that up for me please :-)  Overall  This place deserves the extra star for service but it is your typical Mexican joint but the arrechera seems to be there claim to fame prices are set a bit high but I do taste the freshness and quality."}
{"text":"Yum! Had the archerra (I think that's what it's called) burrito here for lunch, it was awesome! The margarita was good and the chips and salsa were great. I would give it 5 stars but our server sucked, took him forever to get my water, I asked for lettuce in the burrito and didn't get any, and he forgot my side of sour cream. The food was great though, and the prices weren't bad either. I'd definitely eat here again. Plus it's right down the street from sprinkles...what an excellent location! =)"}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm surprised at how this low key place has a great twist on classic Mexican cuisine. The Cucumber margaritas are highly recommended as are the blanco enchiladas(nom), street tacos w/ nopales (nom nom) and dip trio (trip nom squared)."}
{"text":"I don't go to Papi Chulo's very often, but when I do I am pleasantly surprised.  It seems like other Yelpers have a bad time, but the food has always been flavorful, fresh and hot.  We had a Groupon for breakfast or lunch and decided to try breakfast on a Saturday morning.  There was one other table with a couple from the hotel, after they left we were the only customers there.  We both ordered Papi's Breakfast Skillet, one with egg whites and the other with chorizo.  I asked for chips and salsa and got warm chips with salsa, salsa roja (awesome & spicy) and green chili salsa.  The skillet had crispy, seasoned home style potatoes (Papi's potatoes), peppers & onions, jack cheese and egg. It comes with three flour tortillas.  Comparing their skillet to Village Inn & Perkins, Papi's is easily the best.  Hot and tasty and adding some of the salsa roja made it spicy and extra awesome.   Give this place a shot."}
{"text":"This past weekend, some of my buddies went to the Taco Festival in Scottsdale and this place was one of the restaurants represented.  They enjoyed their food so much they suggested we try it for lunch.    First things first...Great service and it looks really adorable in there! Our server was on the ball refilling our iced teas, asking if we needed anything else, making recommendations, etc. I have no complaints. The chips and salsa were yummy and fresh. I ordered the shredded chicken burrito and both of my friends ordered the steak street tacos. The burrito was HUGE (I barely was able to eat 3 bites due to my snacking on the chips and salsa, but it was verrrrrrrry yummy) and the rice and beans were very tasty."}
{"text":"In town building a data center for the next few months and have finally found decent Mexican food. Food in general was flavorful and the tortilla soup was great. Nothing too fancy, just good food. The general staff were very attentive with great attitudes and Jessica was absolutely wonderful. I will be back if not this week then in the weeks to follow!"}
{"text":"Street tacos were fabulous! They are an appetizer and not on the regular menu, but still worth making it your meal."}
{"text":"Papi Chulo's is a adjunct to the Days Inn on Scottsdale Rd  We set up a birthday party for 14 here in the Santana Room during happy hour. The management was helpful in getting this done.  The Cantina was clean. It had a beautiful wooden bar, looking well-stocked. I liked the wooden tables and chairs done in a solid Mexican style... inviting. I arrived a bit late with the party in full gear.  The table had all it's setups in place. Some people already had their food in front of them. The street tacos looked tempting. I was told the meat was tasty and the small tortillas were fresh. I had the taquitos. They weren't very crispy and were almost less than American mild. I had a sip of someone's frozen margarita. The flavor was bright and the drink refreshing. There are times I wish I weren't the designated driver and this was one of them! The good news... our waiter was good at getting my drink and taquitos right away He was pleasant. The bad news... it took 20 minutes to get a glass of ice. Overall, I would give it a second chance - and let someone else be the designated driver."}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience at Papi's.  I sat at the bar and was quickly attended to by the bartender.  I ordered a margarita on the rocks, no salt.  The drink was delivered quickly and it was okay....not great.  I also ordered a grilled chicken burrito a la carte; it was outstanding.  The burrito came with sour cream and guacamole; I requested some salsa which was quickly delivered.  I thought the burrito was one of the best I have had in recent memory.  Plenty of meat and tasty.    The next night I ordered the quesadilla with shredded chicken and it was really outstanding.  Plenty of meat, and very tasty again.  The quesadilla was not your typically round shape, but longer and narrow.  The outside was more of a pastry covering vs. the regular tortilla.  I truly enjoyed it.  If the margaritas were a little more tasty, I might have raised this to five stars.  It is definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"I've been at the Clarion for two weeks now and have eaten breakfast once and dinner four times.  Breakfast is only available to hotel guests and was okay.  I had the country fried steak and eggs(***) and I really didn't like the way it was seasoned.  Dinner on the other hand was great!  I've had steak fajitas(****), chicken enchiladas(****), marinated steak plate (2 times) (*****) and I'm seriously considering going back tonight for some more steak.  The staff is friendly, the prices are reasonable and the food comes out pretty quick."}
{"text":"After driving by countless times, me and my wife decided to give this place a try. We had high hopes. For her, a Mexican food crazy, it was rather a 'disappointment'. For me it was 'meh', below average. The ambience is good 4/5. The presentation of the food is very appealing. Ordered a queso-dip as an appetizer, very tasty! I ordered the combo #3, which is; 2 enchiladas and 1 taco. Well, it failed to mention it was a cheese only enchilada and holy cheese! I felt like I swallowed a pirelli tire for hours. The rice and refried beans were... stale, you could say. Server was very friendly and willing to explain. Hate to say it, but we're still desperately looking for that one great Mexican restaurant that could curb the mexifood craving of my wife."}
{"text":"I checked this place out after it has been open for a couple of weeks, apparently not long enough to work out any kinks considering we were the only people in there.  We went in to check out happy hour. They had a decent happy hour list. Small list of drinks and a list of appetizers for $5 a piece. I wanted a margarita (when in Rome) I figured since their drink menu had a frozen house margarita on happy hour it wouldn't be a problem to make the switch to a margarita rocks. Guess what?!! Margarita rocks is not on happy hour!!! What?!! Really? Besides children who drinks a frozen margarita? (sorry if I offended anyone) The bartender did make a pretty good margarita though.  After reviewing the happy hour list of food, I asked to see a full menu. Needless to say, I was unimpressed with their menu! Awful, 90% of their menu was appetizers and salads, with a small amount of a la carte items in the bottom corner. Really? That's it? Food was bland, the salsa was ok, service was mediocre to bad. Can't imagine I will return for a retry unless it is still open next year. Feel bad for whomever dumped a lot of money into it's decor and location. Good luck papi chulo!!"}
{"text":"Nice staff and decor horrible food. The chips and salsa are good that is it. If you like to pay premium prices for food that came out of a can you may like this place. The 10.00 cucumber margarita taste like a pre-mix with a  cucumber slice on top. Nothing was fresh made, not impressed."}
{"text":"Thanks to Groupon, I found this place.  We've been here several times and I don't agree with the 2 1/2 stars rating.  it's definitely not the best place I've ever eaten, but it's good.

The complimentary Chips & Salsa comes out with a mild Salsa, but if you ask they'll bring out very Spicy Salsa, which is awesome. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/papi-chulos-mexican-grill-and-cantina-scottsdale?select=s_E6fYrea1MBkOLUUwdglQ#s_E6fYrea1MBkOLUUwdglQ  The people who work here are very friendly and always welcome us with a smile.  As a matter of fact, they know that we'll start with a Cheese Crisp and Spicy Salsa so before we sit down they're already working on the order.  I like great service like this.  There's also a lot of TV's in the restaurant, so we come here for lunch on Saturday or Sunday and watch football while we eat.  Overall, it is definitely a 4 Star experience in my book.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"This midwestern mom gives 2 thumbs up! Our last night in Arizona, so Mexican food was a must but I didn't want anything sloppy or too saucy, just simple & fresh. A great way to end our vacation with a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid 3.  Standard Mexican menu.  Good service.  Nothing really to blow me away.  Saw this on the corner and it was close so it drew me in.  Especially being that I couldn't walk at the time!  Nice Ambiance with Mariachi players and display inside.  Food was good, but again no wow factor."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! They were short staffed and yet the staff on made sure all the tables were attended to! Large delicious burritos for a decent price!"}
{"text":"I'm local and have been coming here off and on for years, not because of great food, drink or prices but because its convenient when I want a quick margarita and appetizer.  No more.  I usually sit at the bar and have always disliked the arrogant and rude bartenders and servers.  Brad has been here for many years and treats patrons so rudely.   I'm assuming he must be related to the owner because I have no other explanation why he is still employed here.    With so many choices in Scottsdale, go somewhere where the servers are polite and gracious."}
{"text":"Service was great when we arrive. Very tasty frozen margarita and the chips and salsa was excellent.  But all downhill after that. Food was sub-par. Tacos were not very good. My son had chimichanga which was stuffed with cheap cheddar cheese. Beans were horrible.  Taco salad was not good either.   Cheap ingredients.  Would not go back"}
{"text":"Service is my number one priority.   We had to wait 5 minutes just to get seated during a very slow lunch hour 12:30.  Server missed a few things and had to be reminded.  Food was not very good but I really liked the hot salsa that came with the chips prior to our food arriving.  It was very good spice level for me.  Bland place at best."}
{"text":"Yucky!  I ordered a bowl of pozole and it looked like red sludge.  Maybe because it was late in the day but I was shocked they let a dish leave the kitchen like that.  Either they don't know or don't care."}
{"text":"I went to this establishment on a Friday evening with my husband and was actually very pleased with the attentive servers, good food, and pleasant atmosphere. My husband had a steak chimichanga which was delicious and I had blanco enchiladas which were also very good. We had a lot of fun watching passerby's as this establishement is part of a hotel and has a lot of traffic. My husband and I like to \"people watch.\" We will definintely be going back!! The atmosphere was very fun and the food was delicious!! I hope they add tamales to the menu though. : )"}
{"text":"In town on business and wasn't sure about this place because of mix reviews. We decided to try it because it was walking distance from hotel. So glad we did food was really good the service was great our waiter was by far our top 5 best waiters so far. If ever back in town we will defiantly come back and will recommend to anyone else about Papi Chulo's.......... Great name to lol"}
{"text":"Our server, a young kid from Philly, was great in every way. He was extremely helpful, had a great attitude, and helped us get through the menu.    My group and I were here for happy hour.  So we went with their appetizer platter, a couple of margaritas, and some beers.  In looking at their menu, all of their appetizers are fried in some way.    This $20 appetizer platter was large, with taquitos, chimichangas, enchiladas and one big dollop of sour cream and as well as guacamole.  While this platter was neatly made and arranged with lettuce and tomatoes... It just didn't make the grade.  I wish I had taken a picture for all Yelpers to see.  As neat as it was, at the same time it also looked unappetizing as everything was completely fried except the enchiladas.   This is definitely bastardized Mexican food on steroids.    As for our margaritas, we got them with higher shelf Patron tequila, but their premade margarita mix really brought the drinks down.    Nothing we had here was really fresh, and the total bill on four people ended up being $75 with tax and tip.    I can't recommend this place, especially when there are a lot of choices in Scottsdale for food and drink."}
{"text":"I wish I could give NEGATIVE stars because that's what they deserve.  Management (short, little hispanic guy with glasses and an attitude problem) is deplorable.  He threw my receipt at me, when I asked if he could help me (run my card) because we were running late.  There was ONE server for the entire dining room; he was not smiling, but exhausted and apologizing for messing things up from (no silverware, no order taking for the first 20 mins we were there, and the ticket issue across all of the tables was a HUGE issue for him).  He got no assistance from the 3 people (including the short Manager with glasses) who were yapping behind the bar.  Overall, food was okay - but would never go back to an establishment where the Manager throws your receipt at you and offers no apology for the chaos.  DISGUSTINGLY HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT.....  He should work at the DMV."}
{"text":"Looked up Papa Chulos on the website and it shows they are open to 10pm. All happy headed towards the restaurant and walked in and waited to be seated. The bartender comes around and says, are you here to eat. I replied yes. The bartender replied the kitchen closes at 9pm. I then said that's not what it shows on the website. The bartender then went on to explain your right and they couldn't access their website because of password issues so they were going to have to build a new website.  Wonder how many times they have used that line.  I own a busy salon in Scottsdale and get asked all the time of where are good places to eat. Guess Papa Chulos doesn't make the cut."}
{"text":"Came in yesterday night , chips and salsa were great and free,the waiter Daniel was very helpful and courteous. I  ordered a steak  fajita , best in town."}
{"text":"This was possibly the grossest Mexican I've ever had. I ordered posole and it tasted sweet. By the looks of it they added canned tomato sauce and canned Ortega chilis. I would never eat there again.   The place was clean and staff was nice though so that's the only reason I'm giving 2 stars."}
{"text":"Hurry and get there soon before it closes...if you want to waste a meal there...terrible, disgusting...it's like a school lunch one of the kids said...Taco Bell is much better...it's like airplane food another diner said...We had a steak arachera taco plate, enchiladas, taquitos and a bean burrito...the stale chips were an omen and I almost wanted to walk out then!  The food tasted bad like really crumby old leftovers.  The sauce on the enchiladas was like spaghetti sauce...IDK  if they just don't know what good food is...or they don't care!   Yuck, gross...puke!  Don't go and waste time or money at this poor excuse for a restaurant!  I feel bad for tourists who innocently wander in expecting a good meal and end up with this pile of slop!"}
{"text":"Delicious Margaritas! Loved the red Enchilada sauce! Probably the best I've ever had. The service was great too! We sat outside on the patio and it was relaxing. Just what I needed.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a great experience at this restaurant. First of all it's in a great location off of Scottsdale road and 2nd they have good food and 3 they have a food challenge!    My wife and I ordered the enchiladas and shared them. And my nephew well he order d the 6lb burrito challenge. Funny because I shared with my wife a quarter of the food he ate.lol.  Our food was great, and he said his was good too..eating a 6lb pound burrito in under 30 mins!!! Well he did it, got a free meal, free T-shirt and his photo taken. Now that's impressive and seeing I out weigh him by like 50lbs!  I didn't think he could do it but boy was I wrong!  Besides the food challenge I would come back to Papi Chulos again. Plus there is a comedy club right next door too."}
{"text":"This place was good. Great service and well priced menu items. Definitely a place to hit up if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"When I asked the server if they had any specials he said everything is special.  Love that!  Food was pretty good.  I wish the outside seating was not on Scottsdale road.  The service was good and overall pretty decent, nothing to write home about!  I would come back."}
{"text":"4.5 would be best! My mom and I shared the Pozole and chicken tortilla soup. My mom also got a shredded chicken street style taco. I think I got all cactus because I didn't like it but my mom did. The soups were amazing!! My mom also got a lemontini drink that was fantastic! Our server Megan was awesome! She recommended other good restaurants in town to try and was very attentive."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!!!! I got the Chimichanga with the fajita meat and couldn't be happier! Plenty of food! Service was fantastic as well. Highly recommend trying it out!!"}
{"text":"Best Fajitas Ever!!!! This is our new Favorite Mexican place.  Love it!!! The people were so nice.  Also had an amazing Comedy show with it. :). I want to go again."}
{"text":"This is closed and being torn down. Good idea since was not very good. I hope they put something good in its place.  it's right next to the Embassy Suites which just got face lift"}
{"text":"I really don't understand the bad reviews here. We come about once a month usually on Sundays (we avoid crowds) and sit at the bar to order food. The young lady that works the bar usually (Molly) when we come in is friendly and helpful with helping us order (we try to order different things each time). The decor is genuine Mexican, the only thing I would change is the music to add to the ambience. Our favorite is the fajita. Did I mention they have happy hour on Sundays too?"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! Laid back atmosphere, easy going staff."}
{"text":"Used a groupon here at Papi Chulo's and it's a pretty cool place... After looking at the menu we chose to get the Nachos for our appetizer which was a great choice. The cheese was nice and melted, the sour cream was yummy, the guacamole was good... The jalapeños were not very hot but still good...   I chose the Sizzling Shredded Beef Enchiladas which came with rice and beans. Wow! So the sizzling dish is actually very yumzo! The shredded beef is juicy and tender. Also the rice and beans are standard rice and beans but very good too.   This was a great dish and I am looking forward to my next visit and groupon to Papi Chulos   Oh I almost forgot our server was on it as well, he wasn't over bearing but he was very tentative, nice, and just very professional. Great job :)"}
{"text":"Where do I start?!?! First off, I normally love Papis, so this is not my normal experience here. Here's my night.... I get here, sit at my table for 30 min, luckily my guy wasn't feeling the beer he had ordered, so I drank that. The waitress checks on the table directly next to me, I have to waive her down as she's walking away to ask for a food menu and a Coors light, nothing difficult. She's gone a bit, then comes back and tells me she got busy talking to the bartender and forgot to put my order in AND forgot what I ordered, I let her know what I needed, she walks away, comes back in and is going table to table asking \"Did someone here order a Coors Light?\" Then finally someone stands up and shouts \"WHO ORDERED THE COORS CUZ SHES LOST?\" I let them know it's mine. She brings the beer and I remind her I need a menu, we'll 15 min later I get up and walk to the hostess station and grab my own menu. Then she comes over while I'm looking at the menu and says \"oh you still need a menu!!!\"  Really?!? \"No I have one I need to order for me and my other half\". I place the order for the first meal and she's closing the menu on my hand and turning around to walk away, I had to her know I'm not done. So I finally get our order in. A while later food comes out. My order is right, his isn't, we have a steak wrap with a side salad, should have been a aricharra burrito with rice, cheese and tomatoes on the inside. We wait, wait, wait some more, then we see her and let her know this is wrong and is totally NOT what we ordered. So the manager is running around fixing her orders and asks her who's is this? She swaps the wrong meal with what he brought over to her. This looks kinda like what we ordered. Just wondering, why is it that all the stuff that should be in the burrito are on the side and the eating utensils for my enchiladas nonexistent? My guy goes and let's someone know that we need some help, the manager is still running around fixing stuff. Brings by silverware and napkins, I tell him \"Thanks, it's bad when your patrons have to get their own menus, glad we at least got the silverware.\" He runs off to do something else and when he has a moment comes back and asks if everything is ok. I told him our meal was swapped out for another, but was still wrong. He agrees to fix it. She comes by and says \"oh you still need silverware.\" I let her know the manager brought some over. We get the corrected burrito, then she comes by again and let's is know that she's still working on finding us silverware. At this point I seriously think someone is playing a cruel joke on me and trying to get my ass into anger management classes. The manager comes back and let's us know he's sorry, she's new and a bit overwhelmed, (I honestly think she's stoned) and that he took care of our tab. We decide to move to another area to sit, she comes out and apologizes and asks if we need anything, I let her know we need a box and our tab, it's been a while and in the time it's taken her to grab the tab and the box I have had time to write this review, edit it a few times. Oh, and here comes my honey with the box and the tab. I guess we earned our tab tonight. It's only $8. Thanks for making it right, lose the crappy waitress!!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the attached hotel and figured we'd give it a shot; totally worth it! Not sure it'd be our scene on the weekends, but on a Wednesday night and Thursday morning, our food was fresh and tasty and our drinks were great. Arrachera was out of this world, and the shredded beef tacos were delish. Guac didn't seem to have any mayo, which is always a plus in my book. Their margaritas were blended to a perfect creamy consistency, Lemon Drop Tini was sweet but subtle, and my mimosa in the morning was more than just orange juice with a splash of champagne. Best Eggs Benedict I've had in a long time, and the eggs and bacon special had great thick cut bacon. Super tasty. Both servers were perfectly sweet and attentive. As a bonus, they deliver room service and have some great gift card specials with the attached hotel that were an added perk."}
{"text":"Showed up early for dinner and the comedy show, service was slow, server had no clue of what was going on, tv was changed without asking around if people were watching. Hostess went around to ask about the show but never stopped at our table instead had to sit in the back because they never found our reservations. Horrible experience from the start. Food was ok, nothing special."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Sunday night, 1/17/16 and it was pretty packed. Very busy. Waiter came over promptly and took our order. I enjoyed the Fish Tacos and my wife had Steak Fajitas . We both enjoyed our meals and the pricing is reasonable. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food, go somewhere else but if you are looking for decent and inexpensive Mexican food, come here. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Standard Mexican fare well-executed.  Margarita not too sweet, delicious salsa. Bacon-wrapped shrimp appetizer. Fajitas served sizzling, nicely seasoned."}
{"text":"I love this place! I had a Dos Equis and a Rum Chata, along with chips and salsa. The drinks were delicious, too bad I didnt try the food. Also Im giving 4 stars because Im a little buzzed"}
{"text":"Went to play poker with Dream Dealers. Had some appetizer thing that was tasty, but for the price, was kinda light. (And this was a special for poker players)  Drinks were decently priced.  I wouldn't likely return, simply because it isn't convenient to where I live."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Days Hotel so we went here a couple of times. Breakfast was awesome. The bfast burrito was huge and the tomatillo sauce was killer. Service was a little slow both times but still friendly."}
{"text":"Came here before a comedy show. Chris, our server, was amazing. Perfect service and great attitude.   Drinks were reasonably priced.   I'd say the food is typical Mexican fare. Nothing jumps out and you can find similar in a 100 other Mexican restaurants in the city.  We did appetizers -the guacamole and steak street tacos were very tasty. The chicken quesadilla was packed with stuff, but sort of bland and a tad too salty.  Chips and salsa were excellent.   If you're going to the comedy show, you save 15% on your bill, which is a nice chunk of change."}
{"text":"Not a bad choice for Mexican in this part of town. Atmosphere is open and relaxing. No complaints on the service, but then we were there on a sparse evening.   I had the Sizzling Enchiladas, which is a sort of enchilada/fajita hybrid. Memorable? Not really. It was ok.  It's very worth the price of a Groupon, but even without it would be an ok value.  The most remarkable part of this place remains the leggy logo."}
{"text":"Veggie quesadilla was amazing! Perfectly spicy...and sour cream came with it! :) Good beer, decently priced.  I'll be back if we're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This would be a five star review had it not been for the hostess. It was evident that she hates her job. We weren't welcomed when we came in the door and she seemed annoyed that she had to show us to our seats. She put the menus on the table and walked away. How about an \"enjoy your meal\" or \"you server will be right with you\"? She was also inappropriately dressed with her belly hanging out from her crop top.   But onto the positive. The man that brought our chips and salsa was friendly as was our server (Candace). She was thorough and attentive. My husband and I ordered fajitas and they were delicious! We would certainly go again!"}
{"text":"I finally managed to pop in here for lunch and was surprised at how good it was. The place was almost empty which immediately sent up red flags (maybe typical on a summer weekday?), but the food was actually very good. I will try this again in the evening which I assume will be a little more festive."}
{"text":"Continue to have tasty food and quickly on your table. Enchiladas and street tacos all great. Smiling staff and friendly."}
{"text":"Two visits here in 24 hours.  Both remarkable.  My sis and I stayed at the Days hotel, and once checked in, went straight to Papi's for drink and snack. I try salsa at restaurants, but rarely go for a second bite.  This salsa was the best that I have ever had.  I also enjoyed a beautifully done muddled cucumber margarita...THE BOMB DIGGITY!! I also ordered the Pozole...Presentation was beautiful and pozole also was the best I've ever had (besides mine) Next morning went for breakfast and it was delish...wonderful presentations, service was fantastic!! What a nice surprise for a food spot connected to a hotel...Will be back for sure and have already told several friends about the nice experience."}
{"text":"Good standard Mexican. The steak is outstanding, but the queso lacks oomph and the guacamole is heavy on cilantro. Special mention of the great service we received. I know we'll be back for that steak and I'll ask them to not use the cilantro as a garnish."}
{"text":"Tried to go here twice and both times the kitchen was closed. I'll never understand why restaurants have hours if they don't actually follow them."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast this morning as my band and I were staying at the Days Inn so it was super convenient! When myself and my drummer walked into Papi Chulo's and found the other half of our band already seated we quickly joined their table and waited for a server to bring us some menus. Although the restaurant was empty (aside from one other table) five minutes passed by and nothing happened- the single waiter didn't even acknowledge our presence.  I got up and grabbed two menus and he finally turned around and signaled he'd be right with us- which turned into another ten minutes. I don't know what this guy had for breakfast but whatever it was he should stop, he was moving at a slower than snails pace and being overwhelmed by a total of two tables, though a third did join midway.  When he finally took our orders (30 minutes from original seating point) the food came out quickly and I was really impressed with my Huevos Racheros! Very large portion and absolutely delicious. Shame about the crap service."}
{"text":"Papi Chulo's seems to have sorted out some of its issues since it was first reviewed. Our service was good (even in spite of being a packed house), and the menu offered a reasonable selection of both a la carte and meal options.  But it definitely ain't perfect.  The first issue is one of image. Papi Chulo's doesn't seem to be entirely sure what it wants to be. The decoration is homey and elegant. The hostess and the (I'm assuming) owner are dressed up. The rest of the front-of-house staff is dressed like it's a coed Hooters, though, with the ladies in cutoff booty shorts and most of the men in Hawaiian shirts.   The second--and perhaps bigger--issue is the food. It's not bad, it gives the appearance of freshness, and the meat is cooked well. But as has been mentioned, it trends toward blandness. Most of the food arrives from the kitchen unseasoned and without sauce. Not quite what you'd expect from a joint advertising Mexican and Sonoran specialties. The fresh salsas are decent and add something, but there's a whole lot of flavor missing that you can only get before or during the cooking process.  I was more than a little confused/amused by being served raw onions and peppers. Warm tortillas, hot cooked meat, melty cotija... and stone-cold raw and crispy veggies. Can't say I've ever had that experience before. Can't say I want to have it again.  Our visit was topped off by our server having an emotional breakdown and subsequently either sobbing or being ultra-bitchy with you. Yaaaay.  All in all, there are better places in Old Town to get hit on by drunk girls. Papi Chulo's has the ingredients to make something better, but I'm not sure they've got the recipe."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch during the week. The atmosphere is clean, and the staff is friendly and welcoming. The restaurant and bathroom area was well maintained. Drinks and complementary nachos were brought out fast, but for the amount of people in the restaurant, food ordering was slightly delayed.   Food came out timely, but we had to ask for additions napkins. I had a chicken quesadilla, the flavor quality was not exceptional, but for the price the portion and service was reasonable.  Payment was processed quickly by the waitress."}
{"text":"Just do yourself a favor... STAY AWAY!   Margs are over priced and nothing special.   Ordered the Queso dip appetizer twice... Never got it. But after reading the reviews maybe that's a good thing.  Food was not great. And even worse when getting sick from it!! Ugh -- stay away!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there the other day.  The food was pretty good, and the waiter was excellent - very attentive."}
{"text":"The \"Street Tacos\" and \"Cucumber Margaritas\" are awesome!  The decor is lovely and very tastefully done.  I bet this is a fun place to hang out at night.  The staff is very well organized and friendly.  I didn't have to wait for the waiter to show up when I needed him like I have to do with most restaurants.  The salsa trio that's brought out when you sit down is yummy.  I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Chris the waiter and Chris the bartender are amazing. They are quick, friendly and very attentive. The food is awesome. I love the Fajitas. Very good size portion, I recommend the steak and shrimp. Drinks are awesome as well. They have a very good selection. Providing free poker on Monday nights is also really cool!!"}
{"text":"Order came out incorrect. We then notified the server and he replied \"I just deliver the food you have to deal with the other guy.\" The other guy showed up by the time we were complete and was not willing to do anything but give us attitude. Horrible service... Do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"We decided to try something new so Papi Chulos was it. This should be 2 1/2 stars but couldn't give it 3. Too many weird things happened. So we walk in,party of 3 @10:30 a.m. The sign on the door said open for breakfast and the hours, lunch and the hours ,dinner and the hours. There wasn't a soul to be found but the door was open. We had to walk into the kitchen to find someone. Weird. The server, Jayson, told us they close from 10:30-11:00. Weird. But...they would serve us. Nice. We had to request chips n salsa. He was prompt about taking our order. Food was mediocre but hot and timely. Jayson didnt impress nor offend. I had eggs benedict. Meh..I've had better. Huevos rancheros....same. Then....the bill came. Bloody Mary's are 8.00. Ok, if its good so yeah...not ok. He brought us back the wrong change to his  benefit but we caught it so no biggie. There just wasnt anything ti bring me back. We were the only table in there and in my opinion, that speaks volumes."}
{"text":"We came here while staying at the Cheaparral next door and the enchiladas were ok good but not while eatting the first one and there was a piece of hair chilling on top of the tortilla. Eww gross can you afford hair nets? The margarita was full of ice and sweet sour mix gross mama mia are you serious? Selling me a glass of sweet sour for $10.00 wow how tacky. The service was horrendous the waitress was a real ditzy broad who was more worried about what was going on after work then her own 2tables. I suggest go to another restaurant down the street instead of here."}
{"text":"I wish I had read the reviews before we ate here. We were visiting Scottsdale and found this place. Our first clue should have told us something. We walked in and the place was empty! It was dinner time on a holiday weekend.   We were seated and the table wasn't the cleanest. The staff were friendly but that's the only nice thing I have to say. The chips tasted like they came from a bag, not freshly made. The margarita's were horrible! Mine tasted like pure alcohol and it was supposed to be one of there specialties. We considered leaving then and should have.  We ordered an appetizer plate and the food tasted like it was frozen food that was heated up. I don't know if there chef has taste buds but if he does he needs to taste his own food. The whole meal was a huge disappointment.  Do not go here, turn and go anywhere else!!"}
{"text":"Is the elder waitress racist or something? I hate to label people. But that was the experience I got. I went to the restaurant for breakfast. Was the only non-white. For a long time I didn't get a menu. I had to ask for it. While I observed the white customers after me got menu immediately. When the waitress went around asking refills on coffee, she just skipped right past me. In the end when I stepped out and said bye, she just stared at me. Ok for food, bad for service."}
{"text":"We live in Scottsdale.  We were asked over the lunch rush to wait 15 min for a table.  Mine you....we have been frequent guests.  Poor service."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch and I loved it ! I am bummed that they dont deliver to the local businesses , because i would order more than once a week, infact all of my co-workers love it . The food is fresh , its not your typical greasy , salty mexican. The chips and Salsa are good , the tacos are so addicting too."}
{"text":"Staying in the hotel attached so we ordered food to go, the girl on the phone didn't even know what was on the menu, nor did she know what \"slaw\" was even though it's apart of meals. Also ordered a grilled chicken sandwich, but when I looked at the food the lettuce on my chicken sandwich was brown and slimy, obviously bad. When asked for ketchup, enough for 2 peoples meals they gave me 2 individual packets and told me they didn't have anymore. So I asked if I could have a little container of it and she responded they don't have ketchup in the restaurant. Finally got some ketchup when I stopped a waiter, who was very helpful and nice. He told me to tell the manager, Chris, which I did and he just made excuses for her incompetence and rudeness. Maybe he should just address her being high as a kite and then maybe, MAYBE, she can do her job right. Won't be coming back here EVER!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and will definitely come back next year for spring training from California"}
{"text":"Stopped by here over a weekend when it started warming up and I didn't want to cook lunch one day. I love Mexican food, but with this place the salsa was the best part. It tasted fresh and was really good. The chips, however, weren't the kind I like...I like the super-thin, lightly salted chips that nearly break when you scoop the salsa. These chips were super-thick.   The service was slow, but when I finally did order I got the chicken chimichanga. It comes with the standard rice and refried beans, neither of which I care for but okay...I can leave them on the plate. The chimi just didn't do anything for me -- too much of the tortilla, not enough inside, no cheese sauce, and basically no service for me to ask for extra guac and sour cream like I always like. I've definitely had better chimis at other restaurants.   I've cleaned up my eating a lot, but allow myself one cheat meal a week. This meal was it for last week and geez, what a waste.   There is a bar, but I didn't have any drinks so I can't vouch for those."}
{"text":"This is THE best Mexican spot in Scottsdale. Loved the atmosphere. Delicious food. Great and friendly service! Will comeback often."}
{"text":"The food is decent but the service is terrible. The staff isn't very friendly and getting food takes an unreasonable amount of time."}
